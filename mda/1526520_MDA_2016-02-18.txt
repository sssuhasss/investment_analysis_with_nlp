Item 7. Management Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations Certain revenue information in this section entitled " Revenue by Product Foreign Exchange Impact on Revenue" is presented on a constant currency basis. This information is a non-GAAP financial measure. To calculate revenue on a constant currency basis, we translated revenue for the year ended December 31, 2015 using the prior year's quarter to date average exchange rates for our settlement currencies other than the U.S. dollar. This non-GAAP financial measure is not intended to be considered in isolation or as a substitute for, or superior to, financial information prepared and presented in accordance with GAAP. This measure may be different from non-GAAP financial measures used by other companies, limiting its usefulness for comparison purposes. Moreover, presentation of revenue on a constant currency basis is provided for year-over-year comparison purposes, and investors should be cautioned that the effect of changing foreign currency exchange rates has an actual effect on our operating results. We believe this non-GAAP financial measure provides investors with useful supplemental information about the financial performance of our business, enables comparison of financial results between periods where certain items may vary independent of business performance, and allow for greater transparency with respect to key metrics used by management in operating our business. Overview TripAdvisor, Inc. owns and operates a portfolio of leading online travel brands. TripAdvisor, our flagship brand, is the world largest travel site. Our mission is to help people around the world plan and book the perfect trip. We accomplish this by, among other things, aggregating millions of travelers reviews and opinions about accommodations, destinations, activities and attractions, and restaurants throughout the world so that our users have access to trusted advice wherever their trip takes them. Our platform not only helps users plan their trip with our unique user-generated content, but also enables users to compare real-time pricing and availability so that they can book hotels, vacation rentals, flights, activities and attractions, and restaurants. Our TripAdvisor-branded websites include tripadvisor.com in the United States and localized versions of the TripAdvisor website in 46 countries worldwide. Our TripAdvisor-branded websites reached 350 million average monthly unique visitors during the year ended December 31, 2015, according to our internal log files. We currently feature 320 million reviews and opinions on 6.2 million places to stay, places to eat and things to do including 995,000 hotels and accommodations and 770,000 vacation rentals, 3.8 million restaurants and 625,000 attractions around the world. In addition to user-generated content, our websites feature price comparison tools and links to partner websites, including travel advertisers, on which users can book their travel arrangements. Users may now also complete hotel bookings directly with our partners through tripadvisor.com and also through the TripAdvisor mobile 30 application, where coverage is available. In addition to the flagship TripAdvisor brand , we now manage and operate 23 other travel media brands, connected b y the common goal of providing users the most comprehensive travel - planning and trip-taking resources in the travel industry. Executive Summary Our long-term financial results are principally dependent on our ability to grow click-based advertising revenue, or CPC revenue. We are investing in areas of potential CPC revenue growth, including enabling users to transact directly on our site, or instant booking, international expansion and innovations in the mobile user experience. We are also investing in display-based advertising, Business Listings, Attractions, Restaurants and Vacation Rentals. As the largest online travel website, we believe we are an attractive marketing channel for advertisers including hotel chains, independent hoteliers, online travel agencies, destination marketing organizations, and other travel-related and non-travel related product and service providers who seek to sell their products and services to our large user base. The key drivers of our click-based and display-based advertising revenue are described below, as well as a summary of our key growth areas, current trends impacting our business and our reporting segments, which currently consists of our Hotel segment and Other segment. Key Drivers of Click-Based Advertising Revenue For the years ended December 31, 2015, 2014 and 2013, 64%, 70% and 74%, respectively, of our total revenue came from our CPC product. All of our CPC revenue is included in our Hotel segment. The key drivers of our CPC revenue include the growth in monthly unique hotel shoppers and particularly revenue per hotel shopper. Hotel shoppers: We believe total traffic growth, or growth in monthly visits from unique visitors, is reflective of our overall brand growth. Additionally, we track and analyze sub-segments of our traffic and their correlation to revenue generation and utilize data regarding hotel shoppers as a key indicator of revenue growth. We use the term hotel shoppers to refer to visitors who view either a listing of hotels in a city or a specific hotel page. The number of hotel shoppers tends to vary based on seasonality of the travel industry and general economic conditions, as well as other factors outside of our control. Given these factors, as well as the trend towards increased usage on mobile devices (for which usage trends continue to evolve) and international growth, quarterly and annual hotel shopper growth is difficult to forecast. Average monthly unique hotel shoppers on TripAdvisor sites increased 16% for the year ended December 31, 2015 over 2014 and increased 10% for the year ended December 31, 2014 over 2013, according to our internal log files. The increase in hotel shoppers for the year ended December 31, 2015 is primarily due to success in our online marketing strategy, a growing number of hotel shoppers visiting our websites on mobile devices, as well as favorable comparatives for search engine optimization ( SEO ) due to lower average monthly unique hotel shopper growth, during the majority of the year ended December 31, 2014. Increasing the number of hotel shoppers on our sites remains a top strategic priority. Revenue per hotel shopper: Revenue per hotel shopper is designed to measure how effectively we convert hotel shoppers into revenue on TripAdvisor-branded websites. Revenue per hotel shopper is made up of three factors the number of monthly unique hotel shoppers on TripAdvisor-branded websites, the rate of conversion of a hotel shopper to a paid click or a booking in the case of our instant booking feature, and the price per click or commission per booking that we receive. o Conversion: Conversion of a hotel shopper to a paid click or booking on a TripAdvisor site is driven primarily by three factors: merchandising, commerce coverage and choice. We define merchandising as the number and location of ads that are available on a page; we define commerce coverage as whether we have a partner who can take an online booking for a particular property; and we define choice as the number of partners available for any given property. Hotel shoppers visiting via mobile generally monetize at a significantly lower rate than hotel shoppers visiting via desktop and tablet. o Cost per click (CPC): Cost per click is the effective price that partners are willing to pay for a hotel shopper lead, and is determined through a competitive bidding process. CPCs are generally lower in international markets as well as on mobile. Revenue per hotel shopper decreased 6% for the year ended December 31, 2015 in comparison to 2014, and increased 15% for the year ended December 31, 2014 in comparison to 2013, according to our internal log files. The decrease in revenue per hotel shopper for the year ended December 31, 2015 over 2014, is primarily due to pricing pressure experienced during 2015 particularly in the second half of the year; which includes the impact from (i) product changes, such as our decision to accelerate the rollout of our instant booking feature to our US and UK markets on all devices in the third quarter of 2015, (ii) the prolonged weakness of the Euro, which has decreased our CPCs, and (iii) a growing number of hotel shoppers visiting our websites on mobile devices. Revenue per hotel shopper increased 15% for the year ended December 31, 2014 over 2013, largely due to our implementation of hotel metasearch completed in June 2013, which 31 resulted in higher CPC pricing paid by our partners, due to higher quality clicks being delivered, offset by relatively lower rates of hotel shopper conversion. Key Drivers of Display-Based Advertising Revenue For the years ended December 31, 2015, 2014 and 2013, 11%, 11% and 13%, respectively, of our total revenue came from our display-based advertising products. Substantially all of our display-based advertising revenue is included in our Hotel segment. The key drivers of our display-based advertising revenue include the growth in number of impressions sold, or the number of times an ad is displayed on our site, and the revenue we received for such impressions, measured in cost per thousand impressions ( CPM ). According to our internal log files, the number of impressions sold increased 14% for the year ended December 31, 2015 over 2014 and increased 19% for the year ended December 31, 2014 over 2013, primarily due to increased sales productivity, as well as increased sellable inventory due to traffic growth and introduction of new products and features, while pricing decreased 1% for both the years, respectively. Key Growth Areas We continue to invest in areas of potential growth, including our content and community, product innovation, and international expansion. Content & Community . TripAdvisor is a website on which travelers can research content and share their travel experiences with the rest of the world. Establishing and nurturing a sense of community among users and brand loyalty is a key priority and a competitive advantage for TripAdvisor. As a result, we continue to look for ways to make it easier for users to plan, compare and book their perfect trip on TripAdvisor as well as to share their experiences. Mobile . Innovating and improving our mobile products is a key priority. As of December 31, 2015, we reached 290 million downloads of our mobile app and average monthly unique visitors via smartphone and tablet devices grew 32% year-over-year, according to our internal log files. We anticipate that the rate of growth in mobile visitors will continue to exceed the growth rate of our overall unique monthly visitors, and that an increasing proportion of users will use mobile devices to access the full range of services available on our sites. We are investing significant resources to improve the features, functionality and commercialization of our mobile websites and applications. Direct Hotel Bookings on Our Websites. We believe that allowing users to book directly online without leaving our TripAdvisor websites will result in a better user experience as well as, ultimately, additional revenue to the Company. Instant booking is a feature that enables users to book a hotel reservation directly with a hotel or OTA partner while remaining on the TripAdvisor website. We have been gradually rolling this feature out in the U.S. since June 2014, and in 2015, accelerated the rollout of instant booking for hotels across our U.S. and U.K. platforms to all users on all devices. We also plan to continue rolling out this feature to additional international markets in 2016. Our business success depends in large part on our ability to maintain and expand relationships with our partners in the travel industry. These partners power the instant booking feature on our website and we believe that these partners will also benefit from this feature, through increased reservations and more direct relationships with travelers. International Expansion. We are focused on strengthening our broad global footprint as we believe that penetrating international markets represent a long-term opportunity for us. We continue to improve localization and grow our user base in Europe, Asia and South America, especially in emerging markets, such as Brazil, Russia and China. In addition, we currently have a lead product offering in the Chinese market re-branded Mao Tu Ying (or TripAdvisor China) headquartered in Beijing. During the year ended December 31, 2015, international revenue accounted for 50% of our worldwide revenue. Attractions & Restaurants. TripAdvisor has information and user-generated content on 3.8 million restaurants and 625,000 attractions around the world. As a significant percentage of our users are not hotel shoppers, we believe TripAdvisor has a unique opportunity to monetize its community of these non-hotel shoppers looking for places to eat and things to do. With the acquisitions of our online restaurant reservation businesses, including Lafourchette, and Viator for online bookable tours and attractions, we are attempting to match more users with more businesses. Vacation Rentals . We offer individual property owners and property managers the ability to list their properties using a free-to-list, commission-based structure or a subscription-based fee option and we believe our highly-engaged and motivated user community creates a competitive advantage for us in this market. In the year ended December 31, 2015, Vacation Rental property listings grew 18% to 770,000 properties, driven by strong listings growth in our free-to-list model. 32 Current Trends Affecting Our Business There are a number of trends that affect our business. Following are some examples: Continued Shift to Online Travel and Social Media to Access Travel Information. According to Phocuswright, global travel spending is expected to be greater than $1.3 trillion in 2016. Travel related commerce, information and advertising continue to migrate to the Internet and away from traditional media outlets. For example, consumers are increasingly using online social media channels, such as Facebook and Twitter, as a means to communicate and exchange information, including travel information and opinions. We believe this trend will continue to create strategic growth opportunities, allowing us to attract new consumers and develop unique and effective advertising solutions. Over the years, we have made significant progress using social networking to leverage the expanding use of these channels and enhance traffic diversification and user engagement. We believe that the Internet will continue to become even more integral to the travel-planning process due to increasing worldwide online penetration, particularly given the capabilities that the Internet provides travelers, including the ability to refine searches, compare destinations, view real-time pricing, complete bookings, and access information while in-destination. We will continue to adapt our user experience in response to a changing Internet environment and usage trends. Increasing Competition. The travel planning industry and, more generally, the business of collecting and aggregating travel-related resources and information as well as enabling consumers to purchase travel-related products, continues to be increasingly competitive. There are an increasing number of companies including search companies, such as Google, Inc. and Baidu.com, Inc., large and increasingly consolidating online travel agencies, or OTAs (such as Expedia and Priceline and their respective subsidiaries), as well as new global entrants such as Airbnb, Inc. and Alibaba, who collect and aggregate travel information and resources and enable consumers to plan and book travel. We plan to continue to invest in order to remain the leading source of travel reviews as well as continue to enhance our user experience. In addition, we face strong competition in our Other segment: Attractions, Restaurants and Vacation Rentals. Refer to our discussion above in Competition in Item 1. Business section for additional information on our competition. Accelerated Rollout of Instant Booking. Revenue from our instant booking feature is included in click-based advertising revenue. Currently our instant booking feature is monetizing at a lower revenue per hotel shopper rate compared to our metasearch feature. While we expect to close this monetization gap, primarily by continuing to streamline our booking path to enhance user experience, persistently promoting the TripAdvisor brand as the place to plan, compare and book and continuing to seek partners with strong branding and supply channels, there is no guarantee that these initiatives will ultimately be successful and, if not, our click-based advertising revenue may be materially adversely affected. In addition, our instant booking revenue recorded under the consumption model is recognized at the time the traveler consumes the stay. Comparatively, instant booking revenue under the transaction model is recorded at the time the user books the stay and our metasearch feature revenue is recorded when a traveler makes the click-through to the travel partners websites. Based on our internal data, we currently estimate the average time between a user booking a stay to consuming a stay is approximately three to five weeks, subject to seasonal variations. In future periods, greater contribution from our instant booking consumption model to click-based advertising revenue could result in additional revenue recognized at the time of a consumed stay and therefore a shift in the timing of our revenue recognition. Evolution of the 360 Degree Travel Experience. We believe our role in the overall travel experience continues to grow in importance in the travel industry, as we emphasize to travelers that we are the place to come plan, compare and book their trip. Our websites globally reached 350 million average monthly unique visitors during the year ended December 31, 2015, according to our internal log files. With 320 million reviews and opinions on 6.2 million places to stay, places to eat and things to do including 995,000 hotels and accommodations and 770,000 vacation rentals, 3.8 million restaurants and 625,000 attractions in 125,000 destinations throughout the world, we believe we have the best content in the travel industry for research and travel planning decision-making. When combined with our hotel metasearch capabilities to compare and find the best prices, our instant booking feature, allowing users to book their hotels on all devices directly on our website, and subsequent to their trip the ability to submit a traveler review, TripAdvisor has become a 360 degree or end to end travel experience. Growth in Mobile Phone and Other Handheld Devices. To access the internet, users are increasingly using devices other than desktop computers, including mobile phone devices and handheld computers such as notebooks and tablets. To address these growing user demands, we continue to extend our platform to develop mobile phone and tablet applications to deliver travel information and resources. Although the substantial majority of our mobile phone users also access and engage with our websites on personal computers and tablets where we display advertising, our users could decide to access our products primarily through mobile phone devices. We do display graphic advertising on mobile phone devices; however, our mobile phone monetization strategies are still developing, as mobile phone monetization is significantly less than desktop and tablet monetization. Mobile phone growth and 33 development remains a key strategy and we will continue to invest and innovate in this growing platform to help us maintain and grow our user base, engagement and monetization over the long term. Segments We have two reportable segments: Hotel and Other. Our Other segment consists of three operating segments: Attractions, Restaurants and Vacation Rentals. Our operating segments are determined based on how our chief operating decision maker manages our business, regularly assesses information and evaluates performance for operating decision-making purposes, including allocation of resources. The chief operating decision maker for the Company is our Chief Executive Officer. For further description of our segments see Item 1. Business in this Annual Report on Form 10-K. 34 Results of Operations Selected Financial Data (in millions, except per share data) Year ended December 31, % Change 2015 2014 2013 2015 vs. 2014 2014 vs. 2013 Revenue $ 1,492 $ 1,246 $ 945 20 % 32 % Costs and expenses: Cost of revenue (1) 58 40 18 45 % 122 % Selling and marketing (2) 692 502 368 38 % 36 % Technology and content (2) 207 171 131 21 % 31 % General and administrative (2)(3) 210 128 98 64 % 31 % Depreciation 57 47 30 21 % 57 % Amortization of intangible assets 36 18 6 100 % 200 % Total costs and expenses 1,260 906 651 39 % 39 % Operating income 232 340 294 (32 )% 16 % Other income (expense): Interest expense (10 ) (9 ) (10 ) 11 % (10 )% Interest income and other, net 17 (9 ) - (289 )% 100 % Total other income (expense), net 7 (18 ) (10 ) (139 )% 80 % Income before income taxes 239 322 284 (26 )% 13 % Provision for income taxes (41 ) (96 ) (79 ) (57 )% 22 % Net income $ 198 $ 226 $ 205 (12 )% 10 % Earnings per share attributable to common stockholders: Basic $ 1.38 $ 1.58 $ 1.44 (13 )% 10 % Diluted $ 1.36 $ 1.55 $ 1.41 (12 )% 10 % Weighted average common shares outstanding: Basic 144 143 143 1 % 0 % Diluted 146 146 145 0 % 1 % Other financial data: Adjusted EBITDA (4) $ 466 $ 468 $ 379 0 % 23 % (1) Excludes amortization as follows: Amortization of acquired technology included in amortization of intangibles assets $ 9 $ 4 $ 1 Amortization of website development costs included in depreciation 37 30 20 $ 46 $ 34 $ 21 (2) Includes stock-based compensation expense as follows: Selling and marketing $ 16 $ 13 $ 11 Technology and content 28 27 21 General and administrative 28 23 17 (3) Includes a non-cash charitable contribution to the Foundation of $67 million for the year ended December 31, 2015. See Note 12 Commitments and Contingencies in the notes to the consolidated financial statements in Item 8 for additional information regarding our charitable contributions to the Foundation. (4) See Adjusted EBITDA discussion below for more information. 35 Adjusted EBITDA To provide investors with additional information regarding our financial results, we also disclose Adjusted EBITDA, which is a non-GAAP financial measure. We have provided a reconciliation below of Adjusted EBITDA to net income, the most directly comparable GAAP financial measure. A non-GAAP financial measure refers to a numerical measure of a company historical or future financial performance, financial position, or cash flows that excludes (or includes) amounts that are included in (or excluded from) the most directly comparable measure calculated and presented in accordance with GAAP in such company financial statements. We define Adjusted EBITDA as net income (loss) plus: (1) provision for income taxes; (2) other income (expense), net; (3) depreciation of property and equipment, including amortization of internal use software and website development; (4) amortization of intangible assets; (5) stock-based compensation and other stock-settled obligations; (6) goodwill, long-lived asset and intangible asset impairments; and (7) other non-recurring expenses. Adjusted EBITDA is the primary metric by which management evaluates the performance of its business and on which internal budgets and forecasts are based. In particular, the exclusion of certain expenses in calculating Adjusted EBITDA facilitates operating performance comparisons on a period-to-period basis. We believe that by excluding certain non-cash expenses, such as stock-based compensation, Adjusted EBITDA corresponds more closely to the cash that operating income generated from our business and allows investors to gain an understanding of the factors and trends affecting the ongoing cash earnings capabilities of our business, from which capital investments are made and debt is serviced. Our use of Adjusted EBITDA has limitations as an analytical tool, and you should not consider it in isolation or as a substitute for analysis of our results reported in accordance with GAAP. Some of these limitations are: Adjusted EBITDA does not reflect our cash expenditures or future requirements for capital expenditures or contractual commitments; Adjusted EBITDA does not reflect changes in, or cash requirements for, our working capital needs; Adjusted EBITDA does not reflect the interest expense, or cash requirements necessary to service interest or principal payments on our debt; Adjusted EBITDA does not consider the potentially dilutive impact of stock-based compensation or other stock-settled obligations; Although depreciation and amortization are non-cash charges, the assets being depreciated and amortized may have to be replaced in the future, and Adjusted EBITDA does not reflect cash capital expenditure requirements for such replacements or for new capital expenditure requirements; Adjusted EBITDA does not reflect tax payments that may represent a reduction in cash available to us; and Other companies, including companies in our own industry, may calculate Adjusted EBITDA differently than we do, limiting its usefulness as a comparative measure. Because of these limitations, you should consider Adjusted EBITDA alongside other financial performance measures, including cash flows, net income and our other GAAP results. Refer to Note 16 Segment and Geographic Information in the notes to our consolidated financial statements in Item 8 for a reconciliation of Adjusted EBITDA to net income, the most directly comparable financial measure calculated and presented in accordance with GAAP, for the periods presented above. Consolidated Revenue and Segments Revenue by Product We derive the substantial portion of our revenue through the sale of advertising, primarily through click-based advertising, which includes instant booking revenue and, to a lesser extent, display-based advertising. In addition, we earn revenue from a combination of: subscription-based and transaction-based offerings from our Business Listings products; subscription and commission-based offerings from our Vacation Rentals products; room reservations sold through our Jetsetter and Tingo brands; destination activities primarily sold through Viator; and online restaurant reservations booked primarily through Lafourchette, or thefork.com. We also derive revenue from content licensing. 36 Year ended December 31, % Change 2015 2014 2013 2015 vs 2014 2014 vs 2013 (in millions) Click-based advertising $ 956 $ 870 $ 696 10 % 25 % Display-based advertising 159 140 119 14 % 18 % Subscription, transaction and other* 377 236 130 60 % 82 % Total revenue $ 1,492 $ 1,246 $ 945 20 % 32 % * Substantially all revenue reported in our Other segment is from our subscription, transaction and other products. 2015 vs. 2014 Revenue increased $246 million during the year ended December 31, 2015 when compared to the same period in 2014, primarily due to an increase in click-based advertising revenue of $86 million. The primary driver of the increase in click-based advertising revenue was an increase in hotel shoppers of 16%, partially offset by a decrease in revenue per hotel shopper of 6% for the year ended December 31, 2015. Display-based advertising increased by $19 million during the year ended December 31, 2015, primarily as a result of a 14% increase in the number of impressions sold when compared to the same period in 2014, partially offset by a decrease in pricing by 1% for the same period. Subscription, transaction and other revenue increased by $141 million during the year ended December 31, 2015, primarily due to growth in Attractions, Restaurants, Business Listings, and Vacation Rentals, which includes incremental revenue for the year ended December 31, 2015 of $96 million, related to our Attraction and Restaurant businesses. 2014 vs. 2013 Revenue increased $301 million during the year ended December 31, 2014 when compared to the same period in 2013, primarily due to an increase in click-based advertising revenue of $174 million. The primary driver of the increase in click-based advertising revenue was an increase in hotel shoppers of 10% and an increase in revenue per hotel shopper of 15% for the year ended December 31, 2014. Display-based advertising increased by $21 million during the year ended December 31, 2014, primarily as a result of a 19% increase in the number of impressions sold when compared to the same period in 2013, partially offset by a decrease in pricing by 1% for the same period. Subscription, transaction and other revenue increased by $106 million during the year ended December 31, 2014, primarily due to growth in Business Listings and Vacation Rentals, as well as revenue generated by the businesses we acquired during 2014 of $43 million. Foreign Exchange Impact on Revenue The general strengthening of the U.S. dollar relative to certain foreign currencies (primarily the Euro) from the year ended December 31, 2015 to the same periods in 2014 had an unfavorable impact on our revenue. If we had translated revenue for the year ended December 31, 2015 using the prior year's quarter to date average exchange rates for our settlement currencies other than the U.S. dollar, we estimate our total revenue and click-based advertising revenue would have been $1,584 million and $1,027 million, respectively, or $92 million and $71 million higher, respectively, than our actual revenue as reported, of $1,492 million and $956 million, respectively, for the year ended December 31, 2015. The general movement of the U.S. dollar relative to certain foreign currencies (primarily the Euro) from the year ended December 31, 2014 to the same periods in 2013 had a minimal impact on our revenue. If we had translated revenue for the year ended December 31, 2014 using the prior year's quarter to date average exchange rates for our settlement currencies other than the U.S. dollar, we estimate our total revenue and click-based advertising revenue would have been $1,244 million and $869 million, respectively, or $2 million and $1 million lower, respectively, than our actual revenue as reported, of $1,246 million and $870 million, respectively, for the year ended December 31, 2014. 37 Revenue and Adjusted EBITDA by Segment Year ended December 31, % Change 2015 2014 2013 2015 vs. 2014 2014 vs. 2013 REVENUE: (in millions) Hotel $ 1,263 $ 1,135 $ 899 11 % 26 % Other 229 111 46 106 % 141 % Total revenue $ 1,492 $ 1,246 $ 945 20 % 32 % ADJUSTED EBITDA (1): Hotel $ 472 $ 472 $ 384 0 % 23 % Other (6 ) (4 ) (5 ) (50 )% 20 % Total Adjusted EBITDA $ 466 $ 468 $ 379 0 % 23 % ADJUSTED EBITDA Margin (2): Hotel 37 % 42 % 43 % Other (3 )% (4 )% (11 )% (1) Included in Adjusted EBITDA is a general and administrative expense allocation for each segment, which is based on the segment percentage of our total personnel costs, excluding stock-based compensation. See Note 16 Segment and Geographic Information , in the notes to our consolidated financial statements in Item 8 for more information and for a reconciliation of Adjusted EBITDA to net income, the most directly comparable financial measure calculated and presented in accordance with GAAP, for the periods presented above. (2) We define Adjusted EBITDA margin , a non-GAAP measure, as Adjusted EBITDA as a percentage of revenue. See Adjusted EBITDA discussion above for more information on the limitations of using Adjusted EBITDA, a non-GAAP measure, as an analytical tool. Hotel Our Hotel segment revenue increased $128 million during the year ended December 31, 2015 when compared to the same period in 2014, and increased $236 million during the year ended December 31, 2014 when compared to the same period in 2013, primarily due to an increase in click-based advertising revenue of $86 million and $174 million, respectively, and an increase in display-based advertising of $19 million and $21 million, respectively. Subscription, transaction and other revenue increased by $23 million during the year ended December 31, 2015 when compared to the same period in 2014, and increased by $41 million during the year ended December 31, 2014 when compared to the same period in 2013, primarily due to growth in Business Listings. Our Hotel segment revenue growth rate decelerated to 11% during the year ended December 31, 2015 when compared to the same period in 2014, primarily due to a decline in revenue per hotel shopper. As discussed above, the decline in revenue per hotel shopper was primarily due to pricing pressure experienced during 2015 particularly in the second half of the year; which includes the impact from (i) product changes, such as our decision to accelerate the rollout of our instant booking feature to our US and UK markets on all devices in the third quarter of 2015, (ii) the prolonged weakness of the Euro, which has decreased our CPCs, and (iii) a growing number of hotel shoppers visiting our websites on mobile devices. Adjusted EBITDA in our Hotel segment for the year ended December 31, 2015, was flat when compared to the same period in 2014, and increased $88 million during the year ended December 31, 2014 when compared to the same period in 2013, due to an increase in revenue, offset primarily by increased personnel and overhead costs, search engine marketing, or SEM costs, and other online traffic acquisition costs, and TV advertising. Our Hotel segment adjusted EBITDA margin decelerated slightly during the year ended December 31, 2015 when compared to the same period in 2014, primarily due to the deceleration in revenue growth year over year. The segment Adjusted EBITDA margin for the year ended December 31, 2014, was essentially flat when compared to the same period in 2013. Other Our Other segment revenue increased $118 million during the year ended December 31, 2015 when compared to the same period in 2014, and increased $65 million during the year ended December 31, 2014 when compared to the same period in 2013. This was driven by growth in our Vacation Rentals business, primarily due to our free-to-list commission-based booking model, and $96 million and $43 million in incremental revenue during the years ended December 31, 2015 and 2014, respectively, related to our Attraction and Restaurant businesses. Adjusted EBITDA in our Other segment decreased $2 million during the year ended December 31, 2015 when compared to the same period in 2014 and was essentially flat during the year ended December 31, 2014 when compared to the same period in 2013. This was primarily due to investments to fund growth initiatives at our Attractions, Restaurants, and Vacation Rentals businesses, which are all at earlier stages of their growth and business life cycle, and is a contributing factor to this reportable segment operating at a loss. 38 Revenue by Geography The following table presents our revenue by geographic region, which reflects how we view our geographic revenue internally. Revenue by geography is based on the geographic location of our websites: Year ended December 31, % Change 2015 2014 2013 2015 vs 2014 2014 vs 2013 (in millions) Revenue by geographic region: North America (1) $ 775 $ 629 $ 494 23 % 27 % EMEA (2) 473 405 291 17 % 39 % APAC (3) 172 156 122 10 % 28 % LATAM (4) 72 56 38 29 % 47 % Total $ 1,492 $ 1,246 $ 945 20 % 32 % (1) United States and Canada* (2) Europe, Middle East and Africa (3) Asia-Pacific (4) Latin America * Canada is included in international revenue below for discussion purposes. International revenue increased $100 million and $171 million during the years ended December 31, 2015 and 2014, respectively, compared to the same periods in 2014 and 2013. International revenue represented 50%, 52%, and 51% of total revenue during the years ended December 31, 2015, 2014, and 2013, respectively. Although international revenue increased, our international revenue growth rate decelerated and international revenue, as a percentage of total revenue, declined slightly during the year ended December 31, 2015 when compared to the same periods in 2014 and 2013, primarily due to the impact of fluctuations in foreign exchange rates, specifically the prolonged weakness of the Euro, in addition to our accelerated rollout of instant booking in the U.K. during 2015 and generally lower CPC s, or monetization, in markets outside the U.S. overall. Consolidated Expenses Cost of Revenue Cost of revenue consists of expenses that are directly related or closely correlated to revenue generation, including direct costs, such as ad serving fees, flight search fees, transaction fees and data center costs. In addition, cost of revenue includes personnel and overhead expenses, including salaries, benefits, stock-based compensation and bonuses for certain customer support personnel who are directly involved in revenue generation.

Our Attraction and Restaurant businesses contributed an incremental $15 million to our cost of revenue for the year ended December 31, 2015, of which an incremental $6 million was related to personnel and overhead. 39 2014 vs. 2013 Cost of revenue increased $22 million during the year ended December 31, 2014, respectively, when compared to the same periods in 2013, primarily due to increased data center costs, driven by higher site traffic; increased merchant credit card and transaction fees, driven by additional transaction costs from our 2014 business acquisitions and free-to-list growth in our Vacation Rental business; and customer support costs. In total, our Attraction and Restaurant businesses contributed $6 million to our cost of revenue in 2014, of which $3 million related to personnel and overhead. Selling and Marketing Sales and marketing expenses primarily consist of direct costs, including SEM and other online traffic acquisition costs, syndication costs and affiliate program commissions, brand advertising, television and other offline advertising, and public relations.

We spent $33 million on our television campaign during the year ended December 31, 2014, which was launched in May 2014. Personnel and overhead costs increased $30 million during the year ended December 31, 2014 when compared to the same period in 2013, primarily due to an increase in headcount to support business growth, including international expansion and employees joining us through recent business acquisitions, which also increased stock-based compensation costs.

Our Attraction and Restaurant businesses contributed an incremental $15 million to our technology and content expenses for the year ended December 31, 2015, of which an incremental $9 million was related to personnel and overhead. 2014 vs. 2013 Technology and content costs increased $40 million during the year ended December 31, 2014 when compared to the same period in 2013, primarily due to increased personnel costs from increased headcount to support business growth, including international expansion and enhanced site features, as well as additional personnel costs related to employees joining us through business acquisitions and also increased stock-based compensation costs. In total, our Attraction and Restaurant businesses contributed $6 million to our technology and content expense in 2014, of which $4 million related to personnel and overhead.

Year ended December 31, % Change 2015 2014 2013 2015 vs 2014 2014 vs 2013 (in millions) Personnel and overhead $ 106 $ 87 $ 66 22 % 32 % Professional service fees and other 104 41 32 154 % 28 % Total general and administrative $ 210 $ 128 $ 98 64 % 31 % % of revenue 14.1 % 10.3 % 10.4 % 2015 vs. 2014 General and administrative costs increased $82 million during the year ended December 31, 2015, when compared to the same period in 2014, primarily due to an increase in charitable contributions of $59 million. During the year ended December 31, 2015, we made a $67 million non-cash contribution to settle our pledge obligation to the Foundation, while we recorded a charitable contribution of $8 million in the year ending December 2014, which was settled in cash. See Note 12 Commitments and Contingencies in the notes to our consolidated financial statements in Item 8 for additional information regarding our charitable contributions to the Foundation.

Year ended December 31, 2015 2014 2013 (in millions) Amortization of intangible assets $ 36 $ 18 $ 6 % of revenue 2.4 % 1.4 % 0.6 % Amortization of intangible assets increased $18 million during the year ended December 31, 2015 when compared to the same period in 2014, and increased $12 million during the year ended December 31, 2014 when compared to the same period in 2013, primarily due to incremental amortization from purchased definite lived intangibles related to our 2014 business acquisitions. Refer to Note 3 Acquisitions and Dispositions in the notes to our consolidated financial statements in Item 8 for additional information on our acquisitions. Interest Expense Interest expense primarily consists of interest incurred, commitment fees and debt issuance cost amortization related to our 2011 Credit Facility, 2015 Credit Facility, and Chinese Credit Facilities (as such, facilities are described in greater detail below), as well as interest on our financing obligation related to our corporate headquarters. Year ended December 31, 2015 2014 2013 (in millions) Interest expense $ (10 ) $ (9 ) $ (10 ) Interest expense increased $1 million during the year ended December 31, 2015 when compared to the same period in 2014, primarily due to interest imputed on our financing obligation related to our corporate headquarters lease of approximately $4 million in 2015, partially offset by a decrease in interest incurred due to lower average outstanding borrowings during 2015. Interest expense did not materially change during the year ended December 31, 2014, when compared to the same period in 2013. Refer to Note 8 Debt and Note 12 Commitments and Contingencies in the notes to our consolidated financial statements in Item 8 for additional information on our outstanding borrowing facilities and our financing obligation related to our corporate headquarter s, respectively. 42 Interest Income and Other, Net Interest income and other, net primarily consists of interest earned and amortization of discounts and premiums on our marketable securities, net foreign exchange gains and losses, and gains and losses on sales of our marketable securities and sale of businesses. Year ended December 31, 2015 2014 2013 (in millions) Interest income and other, net $ 17 $ (9 ) $ - 2015 vs. 2014 Interest income and other, net increased during the year ended December 31, 2015, respectively, when compared to the same periods in 2014, primarily due to the fluctuation of foreign exchange rates and a $20 million gain from the sale of one of our Chinese subsidiaries during 2015. Refer to Note 3 Acquisitions and Dispositions in the notes to our consolidated financial statements in Item 8 for additional information on the sale of this business. 2014 vs. 2013 Interest income and other, net decreased $9 million during the year ended December 31, 2014, respectively, when compared to the same periods in 2013, primarily due to the fluctuation of foreign exchange rates. Provision for Income Taxes Year ended December 31, 2015 2014 2013 (in millions) Provision for income taxes $ 41 $ 96 $ 79 Effective tax rate 17.2 % 29.8 % 27.8 % 2015 vs. 2014 Our effective tax rate decreased to 17.2% during the year ended December 31, 2015 from 29.8% in the same period in 2014. The change in the effective tax rate for 2015 compared to the 2014 rate was primarily due to a change in jurisdictional earnings, which includes an incremental $59 million of expense related to charitable contributions in the U.S. during 2015, and the recognition of a tax benefit of $13 million in response to a recent U.S. Tax Court ruling in regards to Altera Corporation on the treatment of stock-based compensation in cost-sharing arrangements. Refer to Note 9 Income Taxes in the notes to our consolidated financial statements in Item 8 for a discussion regarding the Altera Corporation court ruling. Our effective tax rate is generally less than the federal statutory rate primarily due to earnings in jurisdictions outside the United States, where our effective tax rate is lower. This is partly driven by a decrease in the statutory tax rate in the United Kingdom from 21% to 20% in 2015, and our tax incentive on qualifying income in Singapore granted by the Singapore Economic Development Board in 2011. This incentive provides for a reduced tax rate on qualifying income of 5% as compared to Singapore statutory tax rate of 17% and is conditional upon our meeting certain employment and investment thresholds. Our effective tax rate is partially offset by state income taxes, non-deductible stock compensation and accruals on uncertain tax positions. 2014 vs. 2013 Our effective tax rate increased 2% during the year ended December 31, 2014 over the same period in 2013. The change in the effective tax rate for 2014 compared to the 2013 rate was primarily due to a change in jurisdictional earnings and certain discrete items. Our effective tax rate is generally less than the federal statutory rate primarily due to earnings in jurisdictions outside the United States, where our effective tax rate is lower. This is partly driven by a decrease in the statutory tax rate in the United Kingdom from 23% to 21% in 2014, and our tax incentive on qualifying income in Singapore granted by the Singapore Economic Development Board in 43 2011. Our effective tax rate is partially offset by state income taxes, non-deductible stock compensation and accruals on uncertain tax positions. Liquidity and Capital Resources The following section explains how we have generated and used our cash historically, describes our current capital resources and discusses our future financial commitments. Cash Requirements The following table aggregates our material contractual obligations and minimum commercial commitments as of December 31, 2015: By Period Total Less than 1 year 1 to 3 years 3 to 5 years More than 5 years (in millions) 2015 Credit Facility and Chinese Credit Facilities (1) $ 201 $ 1 $ $ 200 $ Expected interest payments on 2015 Credit Facility (1) 15 3 7 5 Property leases, net of sublease income (2) 250 22 45 44 139 Total (3) $ 466 $ 26 $ 52 $ 249 $ 139 (1) The amounts included as expected interest payments on the 2015 Credit Facility in this table are based on the current effective interest rate as of December 31, 2015, but, could change significantly in the future. Amounts assume that our existing debt is repaid at maturity and do not assume additional borrowings or refinancing of existing debt. See Note 8 Debt in the notes to the consolidated financial statements in Item 8 for additional information on our 2015 Credit Facility and Chinese Credit Facilities. (2) Estimated future minimum rental payments under operating leases with non-cancelable lease terms, including our corporate headquarters lease in Needham, MA. See discussion under Office Lease Commitments below. (3) Excluded from the table was $87 million of unrecognized tax benefits, including interest, that we have recorded in other long-term liabilities for which we cannot make a reasonably reliable estimate of the amount and period of payment. We do not anticipate any material changes in the next year. 2015 Credit Facility On June 26, 2015, we entered into a five year credit agreement with JPMorgan Chase Bank, N.A., as Administrative Agent; J.P. Morgan Europe Limited, as London Agent; Morgan Stanley Bank, N.A.; Bank of America, N.A.; BNP Paribas; SunTrust Bank; Wells Fargo Bank, National Association; Royal Bank of Canada; Barclays Bank PLC; U.S. Bank National Association; Citibank, N.A.; The Bank of Tokyo-Mitsubishi UFJ, Ltd.; Goldman Sachs Bank USA; and Deutsche Bank AG New York Branch (the 2015 Credit Facility ). The 2015 Credit Facility, among other things, provides for (i) a $1 billion unsecured revolving credit facility, (ii) an interest rate on borrowings and commitment fees based on the Company and its subsidiaries consolidated leverage ratio and (iii) uncommitted incremental revolving loan and term loan facilities, subject to compliance with a leverage covenant and other conditions. We immediately borrowed $290 million from this revolving credit facility, which was used to repay all outstanding borrowings pursuant to the 2011 Credit Facility (as described in Note 8 Debt in the notes to the consolidated financial statements in Item 8) and is recorded in long term liabilities on our consolidated balance sheet as of December 31, 2015. There is no specific repayment date prior to the five-year maturity date for borrowings under this revolving credit facility, however, the Company may determine to make payments on this debt, based on current interest rates and liquidity requirements, at various times during the five-year period. During the year ended December 31, 2015, the Company has repaid $90 million of our outstanding borrowings on the 2015 Credit Facility. Based on the Company current leverage ratio, our borrowings bear interest at LIBOR plus 125 basis points, or the Eurocurrency Spread. The Company is currently borrowing under a one-month interest period of approximately 1.7% per annum, using a one-month interest period Eurocurrency Spread, which will reset periodically. Interest will be payable on a monthly basis while the Company is borrowing under the one-month interest rate period. We are also required to pay a quarterly commitment fee, on the daily unused portion of the revolving credit facility for each fiscal quarter and fees in connection with the issuance of letters of credit. Unused revolver capacity is currently subject to a commitment fee of 20.0 basis points, given the Company current leverage ratio. The 2015 Credit Facility includes $15 million of 44 borrowing capacity available for letters of cr edit and $40 million for borrowings on same-day notice. As of December 31, 2015, we had issued $2 million of outstanding letters of credit under the 2015 Credit Facility . We may voluntarily repay any outstanding borrowing under the 2015 Credit Facility at any time without premium or penalty, other than customary breakage costs with respect to Eurocurrency loans. Certain wholly-owned domestic subsidiaries of the Company have agreed to guarantee the Company obligations under the 2015 Credit Facility. The 2015 Credit Facility contains a number of covenants that, among other things, restrict our ability to: incur additional indebtedness, create liens, enter into sale and leaseback transactions, engage in mergers or consolidations, sell or transfer assets, pay dividends and distributions, make investments, loans or advances, prepay certain subordinated indebtedness, make certain acquisitions, engage in certain transactions with affiliates, amend material agreements governing certain subordinated indebtedness, and change our fiscal year. The 2015 Credit Facility also requires us to maintain a maximum leverage ratio and contains certain customary affirmative covenants and events of default, including a change of control. If an event of default occurs, the lenders under the 2015 Credit Facility will be entitled to take various actions, including the acceleration of all amounts due under 2015 Credit Facility. As of December 31, 2015, we are in compliance with all of our debt covenants. Chinese Credit Facilities In addition to our borrowings under the 2015 Credit Facility, we maintain our Chinese Credit Facilities. As of December 31, 2015 and 2014, we had $1 million and $38 million of short term borrowings outstanding, respectively. Our Chinese subsidiary is entered into a $30 million, one-year revolving credit facility with Bank of America (the Chinese Credit Facility BOA ) that is currently subject to review on a periodic basis with no specific expiration period. Our Chinese Credit Facility BOA currently bears interest based at a 100% of the People Bank of China base rate, which was 4.35% as of December 31, 2015. During the year ended December 31, 2015, the Company made a $22 million repayment of our outstanding borrowings on our Chinese Credit Facilities- BOA. As of December 31, 2015, we had $1 million of outstanding borrowings from the Chinese Credit Facility BOA. In addition, our Chinese subsidiary is entered into a RMB 125,000,000 (approximately $20 million) one-year revolving credit facility with J.P. Morgan Chase Bank ( Chinese Credit Facility-JPM ). Our Chinese Credit Facility JPM currently bears interest based at a 100% of the People Bank of China base rate, which was 4.35% as of December 31, 2015. During the year ended December 31, 2015, the Company made a $19 million repayment of our outstanding borrowings on our Chinese Credit Facilities- JPM. As of December 31, 2015, there are no outstanding borrowings under our Chinese Credit Facility JPM. Office Lease Commitments In June 2013, TripAdvisor LLC ( TA LLC ), our indirect, wholly owned subsidiary, entered into a lease, for a new corporate headquarters (the Lease ). Pursuant to the Lease, the landlord built an approximately 280,000 square foot rental building in Needham, Massachusetts (the Premises ), and leased the Premises to TA LLC as our new corporate headquarters for an initial term of 15 years and 7 months or through December 2030. TA LLC also has an option to extend the term of the Lease for two consecutive terms of five years each. Because we were involved in the construction project and were responsible for paying a portion of the costs of normal finish work and structural elements of the Premises, the Company was deemed for accounting purposes to be the owner of the Premises during the construction period under build to suit lease accounting guidance under GAAP. Therefore, the Company recorded project construction costs during the construction period incurred by the landlord as a construction-in-progress asset and a related construction financing obligation on our consolidated balance sheets. The amounts that the Company has paid or incurred for normal tenant improvements and structural improvements had also been recorded to the construction-in-progress asset. Upon completion of construction at end of the second quarter of 2015, we evaluated the construction-in-progress asset and construction financing obligation for de-recognition under the criteria for sale-leaseback treatment under GAAP. We concluded that we have forms of continued economic involvement in the facility, and therefore did not meet the provisions for sale-leaseback accounting. This determination was based on the Company's continuing involvement with the property in the form of non-recourse financing to the lessor. Therefore, the Lease has been accounted for as a financing obligation. Accordingly, we began depreciating the building asset over its estimated useful life and incurring interest expense related to the financing obligation imputed using the effective interest rate method. We will bifurcate our lease payments pursuant to the Premises into: (i) a portion that is allocated to the building (a reduction to the financing obligation) and; (ii) a portion that is allocated to the land on which the building was constructed. The portion of the lease obligations allocated to the land is treated as an operating lease that commenced in 2013. The financing 45 obligation is considered a long-term finance lease obligation and is recorded to long-term liabilities on our conso lidated balance sheet. At the end of the lease term, the carrying value of the building asset and the remaining financing obligation are expected to be equal, at which time we may either surrender the leased asset as settlement of the remaining financing obligation or extend the initial term of the lease for the continued use of the asset. In 2015, the Company recorded $4 million in interest expense, $2 million in depreciation expense and $1 million in rent expense related to the Premises. We also lease an aggregate of approximately 410,000 square feet at approximately 40 other locations across North America, Europe and Asia Pacific, in cities such as, New York, Boston, London, and Beijing, primarily for our sales offices, subsidiary headquarters, and international management teams, pursuant to leases with expiration dates through June 2027. As of December 31, 2015, future minimum commitments under our corporate headquarters lease and other non-cancelable operating leases for office space with terms of more than one year and contractual sublease income were as follows: Year Corporate Headquarters Lease (1) Other Operating Leases Sublease Income Total Lease Commitments (Net of Sublease Income) (in millions) 2016 $ 9 $ 15 $ (2 ) $ 22 2017 9 15 (1 ) 23 2018 9 14 (1 ) 22 2019 9 14 (1 ) 22 2020 9 13 22 Thereafter 97 42 139 Total minimum lease payments $ 142 $ 113 $ (5 ) $ 250 (1) Amount includes an $84 million financing obligation, which we have recorded in other long-term liabilities on our consolidated balance sheet at December 31, 2015, related to our corporate headquarters lease. Letters of Credit As of December 31, 2015, we have issued unused letters of credit totaling $2 million, related to our property leases, which includes $1 million delivered to the landlord of our corporate headquarters as security deposit, which amount is subject to increase under certain circumstances. Sources and Uses of Cash Our cash flows from operating, investing and financing activities, as reflected in the consolidated statements of cash flows, are summarized in the following table: Year ended December 31, 2015 2014 2013 (in millions) Net cash provided by (used in): Operating activities $ 382 $ 387 $ 349 Investing activities (60 ) (234 ) (196 ) Financing activities (153 ) (41 ) (170 ) Our principal source of liquidity is cash flows generated from operations, although liquidity needs can also be met through drawdowns under our credit facilities discussed above. As of December 31, 2015 and 2014, we had $698 million and $594 million of cash, cash equivalents and short and long-term available-for-sale marketable securities. As of December 31, 2015 approximately $521 million of our cash, cash equivalents and short and long-term marketable securities are held by our international subsidiaries, primarily in the United Kingdom, and are related to earnings we intend to reinvest permanently outside the United States. Cumulative undistributed earnings of foreign subsidiaries that we intend to indefinitely reinvest outside of the United States totaled approximately $759 million as of December 31, 2015. Should we distribute, or be treated under certain U.S. tax rules as having distributed, the earnings of foreign subsidiaries in the form of dividends or otherwise, we may be subject to U.S. income taxes. Determination of the 46 amount of any unrecognized deferred income tax liability on this temporary difference is not practicable because of the complexities of the hypothetical calculation. Cash held is primarily denominated in U.S. dollars. As of December 31, 2015, we had $798 million of borrowing capacity available under our 2015 Credit Facility. In addition, we had approximately $49 million of available borrowing capacity under our Chinese Credit Facilities, which currently bear interest at a rate based on 100% of the People Bank of China base rate, or 4.35% as of December 31, 2015. Historically, the cash we generate from operations has been sufficient to fund our working capital requirements, capital expenditures and to meet our long term debt obliga tions and other financial commitments. Management believes that our cash, cash equivalents and available-for-sale marketable securities, combined with expected cash flows generated by operating activities and available cash from our credit facilities, will be sufficient to fund our ongoing working capital requirements, capital expenditures and business growth initiatives; meet our long term debt obligations and other financial commitments; and fund our new corporate lease obligations, share repurchases and any potential acquisitions for at least the next twelve months. However, if during that period or thereafter, we are not successful in generating sufficient cash flow from operations or in raising additional capital, including refinancing or incurring additional debt, when required in sufficient amounts and on terms acceptable to us, we may be required to reduce our planned capital expenditures and scale back the scope of our business growth initiatives, either of which could have a material adverse effect on our future financial condition or results of operations. 2015 vs. 2014 Operating Activities For the year ended December 31, 2015, net cash provided by operating activities decreased by $5 million or 1% when compared to the same period in 2014, primarily due to a decrease in net income of $28 million and working capital movements of $16 million, offset by an increase in non-cash items affecting cash flows of $39 million, which is primarily due to an increase in the following items; stock-based compensation; depreciation; amortization of intangibles; and charitable contributions, partially offset by a decrease in excess tax benefits from stock-based awards; deferred tax benefits; fluctuation of foreign exchange rates; and the gain on sale of a business. The decrease in working capital movements of $16 million was primarily related to an overall lower income tax provision for 2015, partially offset by an increase in operating cash flow from deferred merchant payables. Investing Activities For the year ended December 31, 2015, net cash used in investing activities decreased by $174 million when compared to the same period in 2014, primarily due to a net decrease in cash paid for business acquisitions of $302 million and net proceeds from the sale of one of our Chinese subsidiaries of $25 million in 2015, partially offset by a net increase in cash used for the purchases, sales and maturities of our marketable securities of $125 million, and an increase in capital expenditures of $28 million, primarily driven by expenditures on our corporate headquarters. Financing Activities For the year ended December 31, 2015, net cash used in financing activities increased by $112 million when compared to the same period in 2014, primarily due to the repayment of our Term Loan of $300 million in 2015, or an incremental outflow of $260 million, partial repayment of our outstanding borrowings related to our 2015 Credit Facility of $90 million, incremental repayments of our outstanding borrowings related to our Chinese Credit Facilities of $38 million, and an increase in tax withholdings payments of $40 million primarily related to the exercise of our stock options, partially offset by net borrowings on our 2015 Credit Facility of $287 million, incremental excess tax benefits related to stock-based compensation of $16 million, and receipts of $12 million in lease incentive payments related to our corporate headquarters building financing obligation. 2014 vs. 2013 Operating Activities For the year ended December 31, 2014, net cash provided by operating activities increased by $38 million or 11% when compared to the same period in 2013, primarily due to an increase in net income of $21 million and an increase in non-cash items affecting cash flows of $23 million, which is primarily due to an increase in the following items; stock-based compensation; depreciation; amortization of intangibles; fluctuation of foreign exchange rates, offset by an increase in excess tax benefits from stock-based awards and deferred tax benefits. Working capital movements decreased $6 million mainly related to the timing of customer receipts, income tax payments, vendor and merchant payments, partially offset by growth in our business. 47 Investing Activities For the year ended December 31, 2014, net cash used in investing activities increased by $38 million when compared to the same period in 2013, primarily due to an increase in cash paid for acquisitions of businesses in 2014 of $296 million and an increase in capital expenditures of $26 million in 2014, when compared against 2013, partially offset by a net decrease in cash used for the purchases, sales and maturities of marketable securities of $284 million. Financing Activities For the year ended December 31, 2014, net cash used in financing activities decreased by $129 million when compared to the same period in 2013, primarily due to an increase of $8 million in excess tax benefits related to stock compensation, a decrease of $12 million in repayments of our outstanding borrowings on our Chinese Credit Facilities in 2014, and payments of $145 million for common stock share repurchases under our authorized share repurchase program in 2013, which did not reoccur in 2014. This was offset by a reduction in proceeds from the exercise of our stock options of $21 million in 2014, due to the introduction in the third quarter of 2013 of the net share settlement of the majority of our stock options and an increase in payments of minimum withholding taxes related to net share settlement of equity awards of $19 million in 2014. Off-Balance Sheet Arrangements As of December 31, 2015, we did not have any off-balance sheet arrangements, as defined in Item 303(a)(4)(ii) of Regulation S-K of the SEC, that have, or are reasonably likely to have, a current or future effect on our financial condition, results of operations, liquidity, capital expenditures or capital resources. Contingencies In the ordinary course of business, we and our subsidiaries are parties to regulatory and legal matters. These matters may relate to claims involving alleged infringement of third-party intellectual property rights, defamation, taxes, regulatory compliance and other claims. Periodically, we review the status of all significant outstanding matters to assess the potential financial exposure. When (i) it is probable that an asset has been impaired or a liability has been incurred, and (ii) the amount of the loss can be reasonably estimated, we record the estimated loss in our consolidated statements of operations. We provide disclosure in the notes to the consolidated statements for loss contingencies that do not meet both of these conditions if there is a reasonable possibility that a loss may have been incurred that would be material to the financial statements. Significant judgment is required to determine the probability that a liability has been incurred and whether such liability is reasonably estimable. We base accruals made on the best information available at the time which can be highly subjective. Although occasional adverse decisions or settlements may occur, the Company does not believe that the final disposition of any of these matters will have a material adverse effect on the business. However, the final outcome of these matters could vary significantly from our estimates. There may be claims or actions pending or threatened against us of which we are currently not aware and the ultimate disposition of which would have a material adverse effect on us. We are also under audit by the Internal Revenue Service (IRS) and various other domestic and foreign tax authorities with regards to income tax matters. We have reserved for potential adjustments to our provision for income taxes that may result from examinations by, or any negotiated agreements with, these tax authorities. Although we believe our tax estimates are reasonable, the final determination of audits could be materially different from our historical income tax provisions and accruals. The results of an audit could have a material effect on our financial position, results of operations, or cash flows in the period for which that determination is made. Additionally, we earn an increasing portion of our income, and accumulate a greater portion of cash flows, in foreign jurisdictions which we consider indefinitely reinvested. Any repatriation of funds currently held in foreign jurisdictions may result in higher effective tax rates and incremental cash tax payments. In addition, there have been proposals to amend U.S. tax laws that would significantly impact the manner in which U.S. companies are taxed on foreign earnings. Although we cannot predict whether or in what form any legislation will pass, if enacted, it could have a material adverse impact on our U.S. tax expense and cash flows. See Note 9 Income Taxes in the notes to our consolidated financial statements in Item 8 for further information on potential contingencies surrounding income taxes.

We prepare our consolidated financial statements and accompanying notes in accordance with GAAP. Preparation of the consolidated financial statements and accompanying notes requires that management make estimates and assumptions that affect the reported amounts of assets and liabilities and the disclosure of contingent assets and liabilities as of the date of the consolidated financial statements as well as revenue and expenses during the periods reported. Management bases its estimates on historical experience, where applicable, and other assumptions that it believes are reasonable under the circumstances. Actual results may differ from estimates under different assumptions or conditions. There are certain critical estimates that we believe require significant judgment in the preparation of the consolidated financial statements. We consider an accounting estimate to be critical if: It requires us to make an assumption because information was not available at the time or it included matters that were highly uncertain at the time management was making the estimate; and/or Changes in the estimate or different estimates that management could have selected may have had a material impact on our financial condition or results of operations. Our significant accounting policies and estimates are more fully described in Note 2 Significant Accounting Policies in the notes to our consolidated financial statements in Item 8. A discussion of information about the nature and rationale for our critical accounting estimates is below. Business Combination Valuations and Recoverability of Goodwill, Indefinite and Definite-Lived Intangible Assets Goodwill . We account for acquired businesses using the purchase method of accounting which requires that the assets acquired and liabilities assumed be recorded at the date of acquisition at their respective fair values. Any excess of the purchase price over the estimated fair values of the net assets acquired is recorded as goodwill. We assess goodwill, which is not amortized, for impairment as of October 1, or more frequently, if events and circumstances indicate impairment may have occurred. We test goodwill for impairment at the reporting unit level (operating segment or one level below an operating segment). Each of our operating segments with goodwill represents a reporting unit for the purpose of assessing impairment. Goodwill is allocated to our reporting units at the date the goodwill is initially recorded. Once goodwill has been allocated to the reporting units, it no longer retains its identification with a particular acquisition and becomes identified with the reporting unit in its entirety. Accordingly, the fair value of the reporting unit as a whole is available to support the recoverability of its goodwill. In the evaluation of goodwill for impairment, we generally first perform a qualitative assessment to determine whether it is more likely than not (i.e., a likelihood of more than 50%) that the implied fair value of the reporting unit is less than the carrying amount. If we determine that it is not more likely than not that the implied fair value of the goodwill is less than its carrying amount, no further testing is necessary. If, however, we determine that it is more likely than not that the implied fair value of the goodwill is less than its carrying amount, we then perform a quantitative assessment and compare the implied fair value of the reporting unit to the carrying value. If the carrying value of a reporting unit exceeds its implied fair value, the goodwill of that reporting unit is potentially impaired and we proceed to step two of the impairment analysis. In step two of the analysis, we will record an impairment loss equal to the excess of the carrying value of the reporting unit goodwill over its implied fair value should such a circumstance arise. In determining the estimated fair value of assets acquired and liabilities assumed in business combinations and for determining implied fair values of reporting units in a quantitative goodwill impairment test, we use one, or a blend, of the following recognized valuation methods: the income approach (including discounted cash flows), the market approach or the cost approach. Our significant estimates in those fair value measurements may include identifying business factors such as size, growth, profitability, risk and return on investment and assessing comparable revenue and/or operating income multiples. Further, when measuring fair value based on discounted cash flows, we make assumptions about risk-adjusted discount rates, rates of increase in revenue, cost of revenue, and operating expenses, weighted average cost of capital, rates of long-term growth, and income tax rates. Valuations are performed by management or third party valuation specialists under management's supervision, where appropriate. We believe that the fair values assigned to the assets acquired and liabilities assumed in business combinations and impairment tests are based on reasonable assumptions that marketplace participants would use. However, such assumptions are inherently uncertain and actual results could differ from those estimates. As part of our qualitative assessment for our 2015 goodwill impairment analysis , the factors that we considered included, but were not limited to: (a) changes in macroeconomic conditions in the overall economy and the specific markets in which we operate, 49 (b) our ability to access capital, (c) changes in the online travel industry, (d) changes in the level of competition, (e) comparison of our current financial performance to historical and budgeted results, and (f) changes in excess market capitalization over book value based on our common stock price and other market specific information. After considering these factors and the impact that changes in such factors would have on the inputs used in our previous quantitative as sessment, we determined that it was more likely than not that goodwill was not impaired for any of our reporting units. Indefinite-Lived Intangible Assets. Intangible assets that have indefinite lives are not amortized and are tested for impairment annually on October 1, or whenever events or changes in circumstances indicate that the carrying value may not be recoverable. Similar to the qualitative assessment for goodwill, we may assess qualitative factors to determine if it is more likely than not that the implied fair value of the indefinite-lived intangible asset is less than its carrying amount. If we determine that it is not more likely than not that the implied fair value of the indefinite-lived intangible asset is less than its carrying amount, no further testing is necessary. If, however, we determine that it is more likely than not that the implied fair value of the indefinite-lived intangible asset is less than its carrying amount, we compare the implied fair value of the indefinite-lived asset with its carrying amount. If the carrying value of an individual indefinite-lived intangible asset exceeds its implied fair value, the individual asset is written down by an amount equal to such excess. The assessment of qualitative factors is optional and at our discretion. We may bypass the qualitative assessment for any indefinite-lived intangible asset in any period and resume performing the qualitative assessment in any subsequent period. As part of our qualitative assessment for our 2015 impairment analysis, the factors that we considered for our indefinite-lived intangible assets included, but were not limited to: (a) changes in macroeconomic conditions in the overall economy and the specific markets in which we operate, (b) our ability to access capital, (c) changes in the online travel industry, (d) changes in the level of competition, (e) comparison of our current financial performance to historical and budgeted results, (f) changes in excess market capitalization over book value based on our common stock price, and (g) the amount of excess of the fair value of our trade names and trademarks to the carrying value of those same assets, using the results of our most recent quantitative assessment. After considering these factors and the impact that changes in such factors would have on the inputs used in our previous quantitative assessment, we determined that it was more likely than not that these assets were not impaired. There were no impairment charges recognized to our consolidated statements of operations during the years ended December 31, 2015, 2014 and 2013 related to our goodwill and indefinite lived intangible assets. Definite-Lived Intangible Assets and Other Long-Lived Assets . Intangible assets with definite lives and other long-lived assets are carried at cost and are amortized on a straight-line basis over their estimated useful lives of one to twelve years. The straight-line method of amortization is currently used for our definite-lived intangible assets as it approximates, or is our best estimate, of the distribution of the economic use of our identifiable intangible assets. We review the carrying value of long-lived assets or asset groups, including property and equipment, to be used in operations whenever events or changes in circumstances indicate that the carrying amount of the assets might not be recoverable. Factors that would necessitate an impairment assessment include a significant adverse change in the extent or manner in which an asset is used, a significant adverse change in legal factors or the business climate that could affect the value of the asset, or a significant decline in the observable market value of an asset, among others. If such facts indicate a potential impairment, we assess the recoverability of the asset by determining if the carrying value of the asset exceeds the sum of the projected undiscounted cash flows expected to result from the use and eventual disposition of the asset over the remaining economic life of the primary asset of the group. If the recoverability test indicates that the carrying value of the asset is not recoverable, we will estimate the fair value of the asset using appropriate valuation methodologies which would typically include an estimate of discounted cash flows. Any impairment would be measured by the amount that the carrying value of such assets exceeds their fair value and would be included in operating income on the consolidated statement of operations. We have not identified any circumstances that would warrant an impairment charge of any recorded assets in our consolidated balance sheet at December 31, 2015. The use of different estimates or assumptions in determining the fair value of our goodwill, indefinite-lived and definite-lived intangible assets may result in different values for these assets, which could result in different fair values at the date of acquisition or in an impairment or, in period in which an impairment is recognized, could result in a materially different impairment charge. For additional information on our goodwill, indefinite-lived intangibles and definite-lived intangibles refer to Note 7 Goodwill and Intangible Assets, Net in the notes to our consolidated financial statements in Item 8. 50 Income Taxes We record income taxes under the asset and liability method. Deferred tax assets and liabilities reflect our estimation of the future tax consequences of temporary differences between the carrying amounts of assets and liabilities for book and tax purposes. We determine deferred income taxes based on the differences in accounting methods and timing between financial statement and income tax reporting. Accordingly, we determine the deferred tax asset or liability for each temporary difference based on the enacted tax rates expected to be in effect when we realize the underlying items of income and expense. We consider all relevant factors when assessing the likelihood of future realization of our deferred tax assets, including our recent earnings experience by jurisdiction, expectations of future taxable income and the carryforward periods available to us for tax reporting purposes, as well as assessing available tax planning strategies. We may establish a valuation allowance to reduce deferred tax assets to the amount we believe is more likely than not to be realized. Due to inherent complexities arising from the nature of our businesses, future changes in income tax law, tax sharing agreements or variances between our actual and anticipated operating results, we make certain judgments and estimates. Therefore, actual income taxes could materially vary from these estimates. We record liabilities to address uncertain tax positions we have taken in previously filed tax returns or that we expect to take in a future tax return. The determination for required liabilities is based upon an analysis of each individual tax position, taking into consideration whether it is more likely than not that our tax position, based on technical merits, will be sustained upon examination. For those positions for which we conclude it is more likely than not it will be sustained, we recognize the largest amount of tax benefit that is greater than 50% likely of being realized upon ultimate settlement with the taxing authority. The difference between the amount recognized and the total tax position is recorded as a liability. The ultimate resolution of these tax positions may be greater or less than the liabilities recorded. We have not provided for deferred U.S. income taxes on undistributed earnings of our foreign subsidiaries, which we intend to reinvest permanently outside the United States. Should we distribute earnings of foreign subsidiaries in the form of dividends or otherwise, we may be subject to U.S. income taxes. Due to complexities in tax laws and various assumptions that would have to be made, it is not practicable, at this time, to estimate the amount of unrecognized deferred U.S. taxes on these earnings. See Note 9 Income Taxes in the notes to our consolidated financial statements in Item 8 for further information on income taxes. Stock-Based Compensation Stock Options The exercise price for all stock options granted by us to date has been equal to the market price of the underlying shares of common stock at the date of grant. In this regard, when making stock option awards, our practice is to determine the applicable grant date and to specify that the exercise price shall be the closing price of our common stock on the date of grant. Stock options granted during the year ended December 31, 2015 have a term of ten years from the date of grant and generally vest over a four-year requisite service period. During the year ended December 31, 2015, we issued 586,851 of primarily service based stock non-qualified stock options under the 2011 Incentive Plan with a weighted average grant-date fair value per option of $33.02. We will amortize the fair value, net of estimated forfeitures, as stock-based compensation expense over the vesting term on a straight-line basis, with the amount of compensation expense recognized at any date at least equaling the portion of the grant-date fair value of the award that is vested at that date. We use historical data to estimate pre-vesting option forfeitures and record share-based compensation expense only for those awards that are expected to vest. The estimated fair value of the options granted under the 2011 Incentive Plan to date, have been calculated using a Black-Scholes Merton option-pricing model ( Black-Scholes model ). The Black-Scholes model incorporates assumptions to value stock-based awards, which includes the risk-free rate of return, expected volatility, expected term and expected dividend yield. Our risk-free interest rate is based on the rates currently available on zero-coupon U.S. Treasury issues, in effect at the time of the grant, whose remaining maturity period most closely approximates the stock option expected term assumption. Our expected volatility is calculated by equally weighting the historical volatility and implied volatility on our own stock. Historical volatility is determined using actual daily price observations of our stock price over a period equivalent to or approximate to the expected term of our stock option grants to date. Implied volatility represents the volatility of our actively traded options on our stock, with remaining maturities in excess of six months and market prices approximate to the exercise prices of the stock option grant. We estimate our expected term using historical exercise behavior and expected post-vest termination data. Our expected dividend yield is zero, as we have not paid any dividends on our common stock to date and do not expect to pay any cash dividends for the foreseeable future. 51 Restricted Stock Units (RSUs) RSUs are stock awards that are granted to employees entitling the holder to shares of our common stock as the award vests. During the year ended December 31, 2015, we issued 1,016,626 of primarily service based RSUs under the 2011 Incentive Plan with a weighted average grant date fair value per option of $82.95. RSUs are measured at fair value based on the number of shares granted and the quoted price of our common stock at the date of grant. We amortize the fair value, net of estimated forfeitures, as stock-based compensation expense over the vesting term (generally a four-year requisite service period) on a straight-line basis, with the amount of compensation expense recognized at any date at least equaling the portion of the grant-date fair value of the award that is vested at that date. Estimated forfeitures are calculated consistent with the methodology used for our stock options using historical data to estimate pre-vesting RSU forfeitures. Estimates of fair value are not intended to predict actual future events or the value ultimately realized by employees who receive these awards, and subsequent events are not indicative of the reasonableness of our original estimates of fair value. We record share-based compensation expense only for those awards that are expected to vest. Changes in estimated forfeitures are recognized through a cumulative catch-up adjustment in the period of change which also impacts the amount of stock compensation expense to be recognized in future periods. Refer to Note 4 Stock Based Awards and Other Equity Instruments in the notes to our consolidated financial statements in Item 8 for further information on our equity award activity. Websites and Internal Use Software Development Costs We capitalize certain costs incurred during the application development stage related to the development of websites and internal use software when it is probable the project will be completed and the software will be used as intended. Such costs are amortized on a straight-line basis over the estimated useful life of the related asset, generally estimated to be three years. Capitalized costs include internal and external costs, if direct and incremental, and deemed by management to be significant. We expense costs related to the planning and post-implementation phases of software and website development as these costs are incurred. Maintenance and enhancement costs (including those costs in the post-implementation stages) are typically expensed as incurred, unless such costs relate to substantial upgrades and enhancements to the website or software resulting in added functionality, in which case the costs are capitalized. To the extent that we change the manner in which we develop and test new features and functionalities related to our websites and internal use software, assess the ongoing value of capitalized assets or determine the estimated useful lives over which the costs are amortized, the amount of website and internal use software development costs we capitalize and amortize could change in future periods. Refer to Note 6 Property and Equipment, Net in the notes to our consolidated financial statements in Item 8 for further information on our development of websites and internal use software. Revenue Recognition We recognize revenue from our services rendered when the following four revenue recognition criteria are met: persuasive evidence of an arrangement exists, services have been rendered, the price is fixed or determinable, and collectability is reasonably assured. Deferred revenue, which primarily relates to our subscription-based and commission based arrangements, is recorded when payments are received in advance of our performance as required by the underlying agreements. Click-based Advertising . Revenue is derived primarily from click-through fees charged to our travel partners for traveler leads sent to the travel partners website. We record revenue from click-through fees after the traveler makes the click-through to the travel partners websites. Instant booking commission revenue is also included in click-based advertising revenue and is recorded at the time a traveler books a hotel transaction on our site where we do not assume cancellation risk, or the transaction model. In transactions in which we assume cancellation risk, we record revenue in the month in which the traveler stay at a hotel occurs, or the consumption model. We have no post-booking service obligations for instant booking transactions. Display-based Advertising . We recognize display advertising revenue ratably over the advertising period or upon delivery of advertising impressions, depending on the terms of the advertising contract. Subscription-based revenue is recognized ratably over the related contractual period over which service is delivered. Attractions . We receive cash from the consumer at the time of booking of the destination activity and record these amounts, net of commissions, as deferred merchant payables on our consolidated balance sheet. Commission revenue is recorded as deferred 52 revenue at the time of booking and later recognized when the consumer has completed the destination activity . We pay the destination activity operators after the travelers use. Restaurants. We recognize reservation revenues (or per seated diner fees) on a transaction-by-transaction basis as diners are seated by our restaurant customers. Subscription-based revenue is recognized ratably over the related contractual period over which the service is delivered. Vacation Rentals. We generate revenue from customers for online advertising services related to the listing of their properties for rent primarily on either a subscription basis over a fixed-term, or on a commission basis for transactions that are booked on our platform. Payments for term-based subscriptions received in advance of services being rendered are recorded as deferred revenue and recognized ratably to revenue on a straight-line basis over the listing period. Our commission revenue is primarily generated on our free-to-list option, in lieu of a pre-paid subscription fee. When a commissionable transaction is booked on our platform, we receive cash from the traveler that includes both our commission, which is recorded as deferred revenue, and the amount due to the property owner, which is recorded to deferred merchant payables on our consolidated balance sheet. We pay the amount due to the property owner and recognize our commission revenue at the time of the traveler stay. Additional revenues are derived on a pay-per-lead basis, as we provide leads for rental properties to property managers. Pay-per-lead revenue is billed and recognized in the period when the leads are delivered to the property managers. New and Recently Adopted Accounting Pronouncements New Accounting Pronouncements Not Yet Adopted In September 2015, the Financial Accounting Standards Board ( FASB ) issued new accounting guidance which eliminates the requirement for an acquirer in a business combination to account for measurement-period adjustments retrospectively. Instead, acquirers must recognize measurement-period adjustments during the period in which they determine the amounts, including the effect on earnings of any amounts that would have been recorded in previous periods if the accounting had been completed at the acquisition date. This update is effective for interim and annual periods beginning after December 15, 2015, with early adoption permitted. The planned adoption of this guidance in 2016 is not expected to have a material impact on our consolidated financial statements and related disclosures. In May 2014, the FASB issued new accounting guidance on revenue from contracts with customers. The new guidance requires an entity to recognize the amount of revenue to which it expects to be entitled for the transfer of promised goods or services to customers. The updated guidance will replace most existing revenue recognition guidance in GAAP when it becomes effective and permits the use of either a full retrospective approach or a modified retrospective approach, which requires the initial cumulative effect to be recognized at the date of initial application. This guidance is effective for fiscal years, and interim periods within those fiscal years, beginning after December 15, 2017 and early adoption is permitted for fiscal years beginning after December 15, 2016. We have not yet selected a transition method and we are currently evaluating the effect that the updated standard will have on our consolidated financial statements or related disclosures. Recently Adopted Accounting Pronouncements In November 2015, the FASB issued new accounting guidance which requires an entity to present deferred tax assets and deferred tax liabilities as noncurrent on the consolidated balance sheet. This guidance is effective for fiscal years beginning after December 15, 2016, with early adoption permitted. The Company has early adopted this guidance and has applied the requirements retrospectively to all periods presented. The adoption of this guidance resulted in the reclassification of $10 million from current deferred income tax assets to noncurrent deferred income tax liabilities on the consolidated balance sheet as of December 31, 2014. In April 2015, the FASB issued new accounting guidance which requires debt issuance costs related to a recognized debt liability be presented in the balance sheet as a direct deduction from the carrying amount of the related debt liability instead of being presented as an asset. Debt disclosures will include the face amount of the debt liability and the effective interest rate. In August 2015, additional accounting guidance was issued on this topic that clarifies the April 2015 guidance for debt issuance costs associated with line-of-credit arrangements, which states the FASB would not object to the continued deferral and presentation of debt issuance costs as an asset, which would be subsequently amortized over the term of the arrangement. This guidance is effective for fiscal years, and the interim periods within those fiscal years, beginning after December 15, 2015, with early application permitted. The Company has early adopted this guidance. The retrospective application of this guidance decreased Other long-term assets and Long-term debt by $1 million on the consolidated balance sheet as of December 31, 2014. 53
