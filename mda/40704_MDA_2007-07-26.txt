ITEM 7 Management Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations EXECUTIVE OVERVIEW We are a global consumer foods company. We develop distinctive food products and market these value-added products under unique brand names. We work continuously on product innovation to improve our established brands and to create new products that meet consumers evolving needs and preferences. In addition, we build the equity of our brands over time with strong consumer-directed marketing and innovative merchandising. We believe our brand-building strategy is the key to winning and sustaining leading share positions in markets around the globe. Our fundamental business goal is to generate superior returns for our stockholders over the long term. We believe that increases in net sales, segment operating profits, earnings per share, and return on average total capital are the key measures of financial performance for our businesses. See page 33 for our discussion of segment operating profit and return on average total capital, which are not defined by generally accepted accounting principles (GAAP). Our objectives are to consistently deliver: low single-digit average annual growth in net sales; mid single-digit average annual growth in total segment operating profit; high single-digit average annual growth in earnings per share (EPS); and at least a 50 basis point average annual increase in return on average total capital. We believe that this financial performance, coupled with an attractive dividend yield, should result in long-term value creation for stockholders. We also return a substantial amount of cash annually to stockholders through share repurchases. For the fiscal year ended May 27, 2007, our net sales grew 6 percent, total segment operating profit grew 7 percent, diluted EPS increased 10 percent, and our return on average total capital improved by 60 basis points. These results met or exceeded our long-term targets. Net cash provided by operations totaled nearly $1.8 billion in fiscal 2007, enabling us to increase our annual dividend payments per share by 7.5 percent from fiscal 2006 and continue returning cash to stockholders through share repurchases, which totaled $1,321 million in fiscal 2007. We made significant capital investments totaling $460 million to support future growth and productivity. We achieved each of our four key operating objectives for fiscal 2007: We generated net sales growth across our businesses. Both Big G cereals and Pillsbury USA renewed net sales growth in fiscal 2007 following modest sales declines in fiscal 2006. In addition, all of our other U.S. Retail divisions and our International and Bakeries and Foodservice segments each posted net sales gains in fiscal 2007. We achieved net sales contributions from new products, as we introduced more than 400 new food items in markets around the world. We capitalized on growth opportunities for our brands in new channels and international markets. During 2007, we increased our unit volume and net sales in fast-growing retail channels such as drug, dollar and discount stores, convenience stores, and supercenters. Outside the United States, International segment net sales increased 16 percent in fiscal 2007 and exceeded $2 billion for the first time. We also recorded increases in both gross margin and segment operating profit in fiscal 2007, despite continued input cost inflation and a significant increase in our consumer marketing spending. Details of our financial results are provided in the Fiscal 2007 Consolidated Results of Operations section below. Our fiscal 2008 operating objectives are consistent with our long-term growth model and are built around broad-based growth in net sales, focused cost-savings initiatives to offset higher input costs, and increased levels of investment in media and other brand-building marketing programs to fuel continued net sales growth. To drive growth in net sales, we plan to increase unit volumes, improve sales mix, and achieve net price realization through a combination of pricing actions and trade promotion efficiencies. We also will continue to focus on faster-growing retail formats and foodservice channels such as membership and convenience stores, and expand our branded product sales to hospitality and healthcare-related foodservice customers with new products and portion sizes. Internationally, we are focused on building our global brands. Our company-wide cost-saving initiatives include evaluating sales mix and trade spending efficiency, portfolio management techniques including product rationalization and simplification, capital investments in manufacturing technology, and global sourcing. We expect pricing and cost-savings initiatives to help us largely offset significant input cost inflation, especially for dairy ingredients, oils (primarily soybean), and grains. Our plans also call for reinvestment of some of these cost savings in 13 Table of Contents media and other brand-building marketing programs, resulting in another high single-digit increase in these expenditures. Our plans also call for $575 million of expenditures for capital projects, and a significant amount of cash returned to stockholders. We intend to continue repurchasing shares in fiscal 2008, with a goal of reducing average diluted shares outstanding a net 2 percent. On June 25, 2007, our Board of Directors approved a dividend increase to an annual rate of $1.56 per share. This represents a 9 percent compound annual growth rate in dividends from fiscal 2004 to fiscal 2008. Application of hedge accounting under Statement of Financial Accounting Standards (SFAS) No. 133, Accounting for Derivative Instruments and Hedging Activities, as amended (SFAS 133), requires significant resources, recordkeeping, and analytical systems. As a result of the rising compliance costs and the complexity associated with the application of hedge accounting, we have elected to discontinue the use of hedge accounting for our commodity derivatives at the beginning of fiscal 2008 for all new commodity derivatives entered into after that date. Accordingly, the changes in the values of these derivatives will be recorded in earnings currently, resulting in volatility in both net earnings and gross margin. These gains and losses will be reported in cost of sales in our Consolidated Statements of Earnings and in unallocated corporate expenses in our segment operating results. Regardless of designation for accounting purposes, we believe all our commodity hedges are economic hedges of our risk exposures. Commodity derivatives previously accounted for as cash flow hedges are not affected by this change and any gains or losses deferred to accumulated other comprehensive income (loss) in stockholders equity will remain there until the hedged item affects earnings. Certain terms used throughout this report are defined in a glossary on page 71 of this report. FISCAL 2007 CONSOLIDATED RESULTS OF OPERATIONS For fiscal 2007, we reported diluted EPS of $3.18, up 10 percent from $2.90 per share earned in fiscal 2006. Earnings after tax were $1,144 million in fiscal 2007, up 5 percent from $1,090 million in fiscal 2006. The components of net sales growth are shown in the following table: Components of Net Sales Growth Fiscal 2007 vs. 2006 Unit Volume Growth +4 pts Price/Product Mix +2 pts Foreign Currency Exchange +1 pt Trade and Coupon Promotional Expenses Flat Net Sales Growth +6% Table does not add due to rounding. Net sales for fiscal 2007 grew 6 percent to $12.4 billion, driven by 4 percentage points of unit volume growth, primarily in our U.S. Retail and International segments, and 2 percentage points of growth from pricing and favorable product mix across many of our businesses. In addition, foreign currency exchange effects added 1 percentage point of growth, while promotional spending was flat compared to fiscal 2006. Cost of sales was up $410 million in fiscal 2007 versus fiscal 2006. Cost of sales as a percent of net sales decreased from 64.4 percent in fiscal 2006 to 63.9 percent in fiscal 2007 as $115 million of higher ingredient (primarily grains and dairy) and energy costs were more than offset by efficiency gains at our manufacturing facilities. These gains resulted from cost-saving capital projects, the operating benefits of our broad-based unit volume growth, changes to product formulations, and continued actions to replace low-turning products with faster-turning items. Selling, general and administrative (SG&A) expenses increased by $211 million in fiscal 2007 versus fiscal 2006. SG&A expense as a percent of net sales increased from 18.6 percent in fiscal 2006 to 19.2 percent in fiscal 2007. The increase in SG&A expense from fiscal 2006 was largely the result of a $78 million increase in media and brand-building consumer marketing spending and $69 million of incremental stock compensation expense resulting from our adoption of SFAS No. 123 (Revised), Share-Based Payment (SFAS 123R). Net interest expense for fiscal 2007 totaled $427 million, $28 million higher than net interest expense for fiscal 2006. Higher interest rates caused nearly all of the increase. Interest expense includes preferred distributions paid on subsidiary minority interests. The average rate on our total outstanding debt and subsidiary minority interests was 6.1 percent during fiscal 2007, compared to 5.8 percent during fiscal 2006. 14 Table of Contents Restructuring, impairment and other exit costs totaled $39 million in fiscal 2007 as follows: Expense (Income), in millions Noncash impairment charge for certain Bakeries and Foodservice product lines $ 37 Gain from the sale of our previously closed plant in San Adrian, Spain (7 ) Loss from divestitures of our par-baked bread and frozen pie product lines 10 Adjustment of reserves from previously announced restructuring actions (1 ) Total $ 39 In late May 2007, we concluded that the future cash flows generated by certain product lines in our Bakeries and Foodservice segment will be insufficient to recover the net book value of the related long-lived assets. We recorded a noncash impairment charge of $37 million against these assets in the fourth quarter of fiscal 2007. We are further evaluating the viability of the impaired product lines and may incur additional charges in the future, depending upon the outcome of those evaluations. Net proceeds received for the par-baked bread product line were $13 million, and net proceeds from the sale of our frozen pie product line were $1 million. The effective income tax rate was 34.3 percent for fiscal 2007, including an increase of $30 million in benefits from our international tax structure and benefits from the settlement of tax audits. In fiscal 2006, our effective income tax rate was 34.5 percent, including the benefit of $11 million of adjustments to deferred tax liabilities associated with our International segment brand intangibles. After-tax earnings from joint ventures totaled $73 million in fiscal 2007, compared to $69 million in fiscal 2006. In fiscal 2007, net sales for Cereal Partners Worldwide (CPW) grew 18 percent, including 6 points of incremental sales from the Uncle Tobys cereal business it acquired in Australia. In February 2006, CPW announced a restructuring of its manufacturing plants in the United Kingdom. Our after-tax earnings from joint ventures were reduced by $8 million in both fiscal 2007 and 2006 for our share of the restructuring costs, primarily accelerated depreciation and severance. Net sales for our H agen-Dazs joint ventures in Asia declined 7 percent in fiscal 2007, reflecting a change in our reporting period for these joint ventures. We changed this reporting period to include results through March 31. In previous years, we included results for the twelve months ended April 30. Accordingly, fiscal 2007 included only 11 months of results from these joint ventures, compared to 12 months in fiscal 2006. The impact of this change was not material to our consolidated results of operations, so we did not restate prior periods for comparability. Average diluted shares outstanding decreased by 19 million from fiscal 2006 due to our repurchase of 25 million shares of stock during fiscal 2007, partially offset by increases in diluted shares outstanding from the issuance of annual stock awards. FISCAL 2007 CONSOLIDATED BALANCE SHEET ANALYSIS As of May 27, 2007, we adopted SFAS No. 158, Employers Accounting for Defined Benefit Pension and Other Postretirement Benefit Plans: An amendment of FASB Statements No. 87, 88, 106 and 132R (SFAS 158). SFAS 158 requires employers to recognize the underfunded or overfunded status of a defined benefit postretirement plan as an asset or liability and recognize changes in the funded status in the year in which the changes occur through accumulated other comprehensive income (loss), which is a component of stockholders equity. As a result of the implementation of SFAS 158, we recognized an after-tax decrease in accumulated other comprehensive income (loss) of $440 million for all of our defined benefit pension, other postretirement, and postemployment benefit plans. Other balances affected by the adoption of SFAS 158 are identified in the analysis below. Prior periods were not restated. Cash and cash equivalents decreased by $230 million from fiscal 2006 due to our acquisitions of Saxby Bros. Limited in the United Kingdom and the funding of our share of CPW acquisition of Uncle Tobys in Australia. Receivables increased $41 million from fiscal 2006, driven mainly by higher international sales levels and foreign exchange translation, partially offset by a decrease in domestic receivables due mainly to the timing of sales in the month of May. The allowance for doubtful accounts was essentially unchanged from fiscal 2006. Inventories increased $119 million from fiscal 2006, due primarily to a higher level of finished goods in advance of our package size modification of Big G cereals in early fiscal 2008, and increases in grain inventories due to higher quantities and prices. These increases were partially offset by an increase in the reserve for the excess of first in, first out (FIFO) inventory costs over last in, first out (LIFO) inventory costs of $16 million. Land, buildings and equipment increased $17 million, as capital expenditures of $460 million were offset by normal depreciation and disposal of assets related to the sales of our Chelsea, Tempe, Rochester, and San Adrian facilities. In addition, we recorded $37 million of impairment charges against certain long-lived assets related to underperforming product lines in our Bakeries and Foodservice segment. Goodwill and other intangible assets increased $270 million from fiscal 2006, primarily from foreign currency translation. Our international acquisitions, including CPW 15 Table of Contents acquisition of Uncle Tobys, completed during fiscal 2007 increased these intangibles by $58 million. Other assets decreased by $191 million from fiscal 2006. Our prepaid pension asset decreased by $304 million following our annual changes in assumptions, fiscal 2007 asset performance, and our adoption of SFAS No. 158. This decrease was partially offset by a $109 million increase in our investments in joint ventures, consisting primarily of loans to and additional equity investments in CPW to finance its acquisition of Uncle Tobys. Accounts payable increased $105 million to $778 million in fiscal 2007 from higher vendor payables that were generally in line with increases in inventories, and from foreign exchange translation. Long-term debt , the current portion of long-term debt , and notes payable together increased $157 million from fiscal 2006. We issued $1.5 billion of long-term debt that replaced long-term debt maturing in fiscal 2007. We issued $1.15 billion of convertible notes in fiscal 2007 that were used to repay commercial paper. We also carried higher levels of debt as of May 27, 2007, due to increased share repurchases. In addition, as of May 27, 2007, we consolidated a variable interest entity (VIE) in which we are the primary beneficiary (PB), resulting in a $37 million increase to total debt. As of May 27, 2007, we also recorded $23 million of debt for capital lease obligations related to certain contractual relationships with third parties. The current and noncurrent portions of deferred income taxes decreased $274 million to $1.4 billion primarily due to a reclassification of $248 million of deferred taxes to accumulated other comprehensive income (loss), a component of stockholders equity, following our adoption of SFAS 158. We also incurred $26 million of deferred income tax expense in fiscal 2007. Other current liabilities increased $248 million to $2,079 million primarily due to a $118 million increase in accrued income taxes and a $56 million increase in unsettled share repurchases. Other liabilities increased $306 million, primarily the result of an increase in accrued other postretirement and postemployment benefit liabilities following our annual changes in assumptions, fiscal 2007 asset performance, and our adoption of SFAS 158. Retained earnings increased $638 million, reflecting fiscal 2007 net earnings of $1,144 million less dividends of $506 million. Treasury stock increased $1,035 million from fiscal 2007 share repurchases of $1,385 million, offset by shares issued for stock option exercises and restricted stock unit vesting. Additional paid in capital increased $105 million including a $84 million decrease from the reclassification of unearned compensation resulting from our adoption of SFAS 123R, an $11 million after-tax decrease from the issuance of shares to settle the conversion premium on our zero coupon contingently convertible debentures, and a $95 million decrease from the issuance of stock awards during fiscal 2007, offset by an increase of $105 million from current year stock option exercises and $128 million of stock compensation expense recognized in fiscal 2007 earnings. Accumulated other comprehensive income (loss) decreased by $245 million after-tax, including a $440 million after-tax reduction from our adoption of SFAS 158 offset by favorable foreign exchange translation of $194 million. FISCAL 2006 CONSOLIDATED RESULTS OF OPERATIONS For fiscal 2006, we reported diluted EPS of $2.90. This was down 6 percent from $3.08 per share earned in fiscal 2005, which included a significant net gain from divestitures and debt repurchases. Earnings after tax were $1,090 million in fiscal 2006, down 12 percent from $1,240 million in fiscal 2005, primarily due to the net benefit of gains on divestitures and debt repurchase costs in fiscal 2005. The components of net sales growth are shown in the following table: Components of Net Sales Growth Fiscal 2006 vs. 2005 Unit Volume Growth +2 pts Price/Product Mix +1 pt Foreign Currency Exchange Flat Trade and Coupon Promotion Expense Flat Net Sales Growth +4% Table does not add due to rounding. Net sales for fiscal 2006 grew 4 percent to $11.7 billion, driven by 2 percentage points of unit volume growth, primarily in U.S. Retail and International, and 1 percentage point of growth from pricing and product mix across many of our businesses. Foreign currency exchange effects and promotional spending were flat compared to fiscal 2005. Cost of sales was up $219 million in fiscal 2006 versus fiscal 2005, primarily due to unit volume increases and a $89 million increase in customer freight expense, as manufacturing efficiencies largely offset cost increases due to inflation. Also, the year-over-year change in cost of sales was favorably impacted by the following costs incurred in fiscal 2005: $18 million in expense from accelerated depreciation associated with exit activities, as described below; and $5 million of product recall costs. Cost of sales as a percent of net sales decreased from 64.8 percent in fiscal 2005 to 64.4 percent in fiscal 2006. SG&A expense increased by $181 million in fiscal 2006. SG&A expense as a percent of net sales increased from 16 Table of Contents 17.7 percent in fiscal 2005 to 18.6 percent in fiscal 2006. The increase in SG&A expense from fiscal 2005 was largely the result of: a $97 million increase in domestic employee benefit costs, including incentives; a $49 million increase in consumer marketing spending; and a $23 million increase in environmental reserves. Restructuring, impairment and other exit costs totaled $30 million in fiscal 2006. The components of this expense are summarized in the table below: In Millions Closure of our Swedesboro, New Jersey plant $ 13 Closure of a production line at our Montreal, Quebec plant 6 Restructuring actions at our Allentown, Pennsylvania plant 4 Asset impairment charge at our Rochester, New York plant 3 Adjustment of reserves from previously announced restructuring actions 4 Total $ 30 In fiscal 2005, we recorded restructuring, impairment, and other exit costs pursuant to approved plans as follows: In Millions Charges associated with supply chain initiatives $ 44 Relocation of a frozen baked goods line from our Boston, Massachusetts plant 30 Bakeries and Foodservice severance charges 3 Adjustment of reserves from previously announced restructuring actions 7 Total $ 84 The supply chain initiatives were undertaken to further increase asset utilization and reduce manufacturing and sourcing costs, resulting in decisions regarding plant closures and production realignment. The actions included decisions to: close our flour milling plant in Vallejo, California; close our par-baked bread plant in Medley, Florida; relocate bread production from our Swedesboro, New Jersey plant; relocate a portion of our cereal production from our plant in Cincinnati, Ohio; close our snacks foods plant in Iowa City, Iowa; and close our dry mix production at Trenton, Ontario. Net interest expense for fiscal 2006 totaled $399 million, $56 million lower than interest expense for fiscal 2005 of $455 million, primarily as the result of debt pay down and the maturation of interest rate swaps. In fiscal 2006, we had interest rate swaps that converted $500 million of fixed-rate debt to floating rates. Taking into account the effect of our interest rate swaps, the average interest rate on our total outstanding debt and subsidiary minority interests was 5.8 percent in fiscal 2006, compared to 5.9 percent in fiscal 2005. The effective income tax rate was 34.5 percent for fiscal 2006, including the benefit of $11 million of adjustments to deferred tax liabilities associated with our International segment brand intangibles. In fiscal 2005, our effective income tax rate was 36.6 percent, higher than fiscal 2005 primarily due to the tax impacts of our fiscal 2005 divestitures. After-tax earnings from joint ventures totaled $69 million in fiscal 2006, compared to $94 million in fiscal 2005. Earnings from joint ventures in fiscal 2005 included $28 million from our Snack Ventures Europe (SVE) joint venture with PepsiCo, Inc., which we divested on February 28, 2005. In fiscal 2006, net sales for CPW grew 4 percent. In February 2006, CPW announced a restructuring of its manufacturing plants in the United Kingdom. Our after-tax earnings from joint ventures was reduced by $8 million for our share of the restructuring costs, primarily accelerated depreciation and severance, incurred in fiscal 2006. Net sales for our H agen-Dazs joint ventures in Asia declined 7 percent from fiscal 2005 due to an unseasonably cold winter and increased competitive pressure in Japan. Average diluted shares outstanding decreased by 30 million from fiscal 2005. This was primarily due to the repurchase of a significant portion of our zero coupon contingently convertible debentures in October 2005 and the completion of a consent solicitation related to the remaining convertible debentures in December 2005. These actions ended the dilutive accounting effect of these debentures in our EPS calculations. In addition, we repurchased 19 million shares of our stock during fiscal 2006, partially offset by the issuance of shares upon stock option exercises. RESULTS OF SEGMENT OPERATIONS Our businesses are organized into three operating segments: U.S. Retail, International, and Bakeries and Foodservice. The following tables provide the dollar amount and percentage of net sales and operating profit from each reportable segment for fiscal years 2007, 2006, and 2005: Net Sales Dollars In Millions, Fiscal Year 2007 2006 2005 Net Sales Percent of Net Sales Net Sales Percent of Net Sales Net Sales Percent of Net Sales U.S. Retail $ 8,491 68 % $ 8,137 69 % $ 7,891 70 % International 2,124 17 1,837 16 1,725 15 Bakeries and Foodservice 1,827 15 1,738 15 1,692 15 Total $ 12,442 100 % $ 11,712 100 % $ 11,308 100 % 17 Table of Contents Segment Operating Profit Dollars In Millions, Fiscal Year 2007 2006 2005 Segment Operating Profit Percent of Segment Operating Profit Segment Operating Profit Percent of Segment Operating Profit Segment Operating Profit Percent of Segment Operating Profit U.S. Retail $ 1,896 84 % $ 1,801 85 % $ 1,745 87 % International 216 10 194 9 163 8 Bakeries and Foodservice 148 6 116 6 108 5 Total $ 2,260 100 % $ 2,111 100 % $ 2,016 100 % Segment operating profit excludes unallocated corporate expenses of $163 million for fiscal 2007, $123 million for fiscal 2006, and $32 million for fiscal 2005; and also excludes restructuring, impairment and other exit costs because these items affecting operating profit are centrally managed at the corporate level and are excluded from the measure of segment profitability reviewed by our executive management. U.S. RETAIL SEGMENT Our U.S. Retail segment reflects business with a wide variety of grocery stores, mass merchandisers, membership stores, natural food chains, and drug, dollar and discount chains operating throughout the United States. Our major product categories in this business segment are ready-to-eat cereals, refrigerated yogurt, ready-to-serve soup, dry dinners, shelf stable and frozen vegetables, refrigerated and frozen dough products, dessert and baking mixes, frozen pizza and pizza snacks, grain, fruit and savory snacks, microwave popcorn, and a wide variety of organic products including soup, granola bars, and cereal. The components of the changes in net sales are shown in the following table: Components of U.S. Retail Change in Net Sales Fiscal 2007 vs. 2006 Fiscal 2006 vs. 2005 Unit Volume Growth +4 pts +2 pts Price/Product Mix Flat Flat Trade and Coupon Promotion Expense Flat +1 pt Change in Net Sales +4% +3% In fiscal 2007, net sales for our U.S. Retail operations were $8.5 billion, up 4 percent from fiscal 2006. This growth in net sales was the result of a 4 percentage point increase in unit volume, led by strong growth in our grain snacks business, as well as volume increases in our Yoplait, Meals, and Pillsbury USA divisions. The unit volume increase was largely driven by higher levels of consumer marketing spending and new product innovation, resulting in higher sales to key customers. Net sales for this segment totaled $8.1 billion in fiscal 2006 and $7.9 billion in fiscal 2005. Unit volume increased 2 points in fiscal 2006 versus fiscal 2005, led by strong growth in our Yoplait business and volume increases in our Meals, Baking Products and Snacks divisions. Favorable trade and coupon spending also contributed 1 point to the fiscal 2006 increase in net sales, as the rate of promotional activity decreased on a year-over-year basis, largely the result of narrowing price gaps between our products and competitors products in several heavily promoted categories. All of our U.S. Retail divisions experienced net sales growth in fiscal 2007 as shown in the tables below: U.S. Retail Net Sales by Division Dollars In Millions, Fiscal Year 2007 2006 2005 U.S. Retail: Big G $ 1,933 $ 1,903 $ 1,919 Meals 1,909 1,816 1,697 Pillsbury USA 1,591 1,550 1,562 Yoplait 1,171 1,099 967 Snacks 1,066 967 924 Baking Products 667 650 615 Small Planet Foods and Other 154 152 207 Total U.S. Retail $ 8,491 $ 8,137 $ 7,891 U.S. Retail Change in Net Sales by Division Fiscal 2007 vs. 2006 Fiscal 2006 vs. 2005 Big G +2 % 1 % Meals +5 +7 Pillsbury USA +3 1 Yoplait +6 +14 Snacks +10 +5 Baking Products +3 +6 Small Planet Foods +21 +27 Total U.S. Retail +4 % +3 % In fiscal 2007, Big G cereals net sales grew 2 percent as a result of new product launches such as Fruity Cheerios and Nature Valley cereals, and continued strong performance of the Cheerios franchise. Net sales for the Meals division grew by 5 percent led by the introduction of Progresso reduced sodium soups and Hamburger Helper Microwave Singles , and the continued strong performance of our other Hamburger Helper and Progresso offerings. Net sales for Pillsbury USA increased 3 percent as core refrigerated dough products, Totino Pizza Rolls pizza snacks and Toaster Strudel pastries all generated solid growth. The Yoplait division net sales grew 6 percent primarily due to strong performance by Yoplait Light, Go-GURT , and Yoplait Kids yogurt. Net sales for the Snacks division grew 10 percent led by continuing growth for Nature Valley granola bars and the introduction of Fiber One bars. Baking Products net sales grew 3 percent reflecting greater focus on product lines such as Bisquick baking mix and Warm Delights microwaveable desserts. 18 Table of Contents For fiscal 2006, Big G cereals net sales declined 1 percent as our merchandising activity lagged competitors levels, particularly in the first half of the year. The Meals division net sales grew by 7 percent led by Progresso soup and Hamburger Helper. Pillsbury USA net sales declined 1 percent due to weakness in frozen breakfast items, frozen baked goods, and refrigerated cookies. Net sales for the Yoplait division grew 14 percent over fiscal 2005 primarily due to growth in established cup yogurt lines. Net sales for the Snacks division grew 5 percent led by Nature Valley granola bars and Chex Mix products. Baking Products net sales grew 6 percent reflecting the introduction of Warm Delights microwaveable desserts and strong performance during the holiday baking season. Operating profit of $1.9 billion in fiscal 2007 improved $95 million, or 5 percent, over fiscal 2006. Unit volume increased operating profit by $127 million, and inflation in ingredients (primarily grains and dairy), energy, and labor costs was more than offset by efficiency gains at our manufacturing facilities resulting from cost-saving capital projects, changes to product formulations, and continued actions to reduce low-turning products. These increases in operating profit were partially offset by $46 million of brand-building consumer marketing spending. Operating profit of $1.8 billion in fiscal 2006 improved $56 million, or 3 percent, over fiscal 2005. Unit volume increases accounted for approximately $89 million of improvement. Net pricing realization and product mix contributed $98 million. These factors exceeded manufacturing and distribution rate increases of $77 million, and increases in consumer marketing spending of $32 million. INTERNATIONAL SEGMENT In Canada, our major product categories are ready-to-eat cereals, shelf stable and frozen vegetables, dry dinners, refrigerated and frozen dough products, dessert and baking mixes, frozen pizza snacks, and grain, fruit and savory snacks. In markets outside North America, our product categories include super-premium ice cream, grain snacks, shelf stable and frozen vegetables, dough products, and dry dinners. Our International segment also includes products manufactured in the United States for export internationally, primarily to the Caribbean and Latin American markets, as well as products we manufacture for sale to our international joint ventures. Revenues from export activities are reported in the region or country where the end customer is located. These international businesses are managed through 34 sales and marketing offices. The components of net sales growth are shown in the following table: Components of International Change in Net Sales Fiscal 2007 vs. 2006 Fiscal 2006 vs. 2005 Unit Volume Growth +8 pts +4 pts Price/Product Mix +6 pts +2 pts Foreign Currency Exchange +4 pts +1 pt Trade and Coupon Promotion Expense -2 pts 1 pt Change in Net Sales +16% +6% For fiscal 2007, net sales for our International segment were $2.1 billion, up 16 percent from fiscal 2006. This growth was largely driven by a 15 percent increase in net sales of H agen-Dazs ice cream and the continued strong performance of Green Giant and Old El Paso products across Europe. Acquisitions made in fiscal 2007 contributed less than 1 point of net sales growth. Four points of net sales growth came from favorable foreign exchange. Net sales totaled $1.8 billion in fiscal 2006 and $1.7 billion in fiscal 2005. For fiscal 2006 versus fiscal 2005, unit volume grew 4 percent, driven by a 6 percent increase in the Asia/Pacific region. Net sales growth for our International segment by geographic region is shown in the following tables: International Net Sales by Geographic Region Dollars In Millions, Fiscal Year 2007 2006 2005 Europe $ 756 $ 629 $ 622 Canada 611 566 514 Asia/Pacific 462 403 370 Latin America and South Africa 295 239 219 Total International $ 2,124 $ 1,837 $ 1,725 International Change in Net Sales by Geographic Region Fiscal 2007 vs. 2006 Fiscal 2006 vs. 2005 Europe +20 % +1 % Canada +8 +10 Asia/Pacific +14 +9 Latin America and South Africa +21 +9 Total International +16 % +6 % In fiscal 2007, net sales in Europe grew 20 percent reflecting 15 percent growth in net sales of H agen-Dazs ice cream and continued strong performance from Old El Paso and Green Giant across the region, and especially in the United Kingdom. The acquisition of Saxby Bros. Limited, a chilled pastry company in the United Kingdom, contributed less than 1 point of net sales growth. Net sales in Canada increased 8 percent, led by 35 percent net sales growth on Nature Valley snack bars, 6 percent net sales growth in cereals and 11 percent net sales growth on Old El Paso products. Asia/Pacific net sales increased 14 percent led by 17 percent net sales growth for H agen-Dazs in China. Latin America 19 Table of Contents and South Africa net sales increased 21 percent led by 20 percent growth in our Diablitos product line and the re-launch of H agen-Dazs in Latin America. Operating profit for fiscal 2007 grew to $216 million, up 11 percent from fiscal 2006, with foreign currency exchange contributing 5 points of that growth. The growth was led by a $48 million increase from higher volumes driven by increases in consumer marketing spending. Net price realization offset supply chain and administrative cost increases. Operating profit for fiscal 2006 grew to $194 million, up 19 percent from the prior year, with foreign currency exchange effects contributing 2 percentage points of that growth. Improvement in unit volume contributed $24 million, net price realization of $46 million more than offset the effects of supply chain cost changes, and consumer marketing spending increased $24 million. BAKERIES AND FOODSERVICE SEGMENT In our Bakeries and Foodservice segment we sell branded ready-to-eat cereals, snacks, dinner and side dish products, refrigerated and soft-serve frozen yogurt, frozen dough products, branded baking mixes, and custom food items. Our customers include foodservice distributors and operators, convenience stores, vending machine operators, quick service and other restaurant operators, and business and school cafeterias in the United States and Canada. In addition, we market mixes and unbaked and fully baked frozen dough products throughout the United States and Canada to retail, supermarket and wholesale bakeries. The components of the change in net sales are shown in the following table: Components of Bakeries and Foodservice Change in Net Sales Fiscal 2007 vs. 2006 Fiscal 2006 vs. 2005 Unit Volume Growth +2 pts Flat Price/Product Mix +6 pts +3 pts Divested Product Lines 2 pts Flat Trade and Coupon Promotion Expense 1 pt Flat Change in Net Sales +5% +3% For fiscal 2007, net sales for our Bakeries and Foodservice segment increased 5 percent to $1.8 billion. The growth in fiscal 2007 net sales was driven by: increased sales of higher margin, branded products and the introduction of new products to customers such as schools, hotels, restaurants, and convenience stores; improved innovation in foodservice products; and favorable net price realization. Net sales increased slightly from fiscal 2005 to fiscal 2006. Fiscal 2006 unit volume was flat as compared to fiscal 2005, with net price realization and product mix causing the increase in net sales. Net sales growth for our Bakeries and Foodservice segment by customer segment is shown in the following tables: Bakeries and Foodservice Net Sales by Customer Segment Dollars in Millions, Fiscal Year 2007 2006 2005 Distributors and restaurants $ 872 $ 894 $ 890 Bakery channels 773 681 648 Convenience stores and vending 182 163 154 Total Bakeries and Foodservice $ 1,827 $ 1,738 $ 1,692 Bakeries and Foodservice Changes in Net Sales by Customer Segment Fiscal 2007 vs. 2006 Fiscal 2006 vs. 2005 Distributors and restaurants 2 % Flat Bakery channels 14 % 5 % Convenience stores and vending 12 % 6 % Total Bakeries and Foodservice 5 % 3 % Operating profits for the segment were $148 million in fiscal 2007, up 28 percent from $116 million in fiscal 2006. The business was able to offset record levels of input cost inflation with a combination of pricing actions, sourcing productivity and manufacturing improvements. Fiscal 2006 operating profits for the segment were $116 million, up 7 percent from $108 million in fiscal 2005. Unit volume was flat, and pricing actions essentially covered supply chain cost inflation of $41 million. UNALLOCATED CORPORATE EXPENSES Unallocated corporate expenses include variances to planned corporate overhead expenses, variances to planned domestic employee benefits and incentives, all stock compensation costs, annual contributions to the General Mills Foundation, and other items that are not part of our measurement of segment operating performance. For fiscal 2007, unallocated corporate expenses were $163 million, compared to $123 million in fiscal 2006. Fiscal 2007 included $69 million of incremental expense relating to the impact of the adoption of SFAS 123R, and fiscal 2006 included $33 million of charges related to increases in environmental reserves and a write-down of the asset value of a low-income housing investment. Excluding these items, unallocated corporate expenses were essentially unchanged from fiscal 2006. Unallocated corporate expenses were $123 million in fiscal 2006 compared to $32 million in fiscal 2005. Fiscal 2006 included: higher domestic employee benefit expense, including incentives, which increased by $61 million over fiscal 2005; increases in environmental reserves of $23 million; and a $10 million write-down of the asset value of a low-income housing investment. 20 Table of Contents JOINT VENTURES In addition to our consolidated operations, we manufacture and sell products through several joint ventures. International Joint Ventures We have a 50 percent equity interest in CPW that manufactures and markets ready-to-eat cereal products in more than 130 countries and republics outside the United States and Canada. CPW also markets cereal bars in several European countries and manufactures private label cereals for customers in the United Kingdom. Results from our CPW joint venture are reported for the 12 months ended March 31. On July 14, 2006, CPW acquired the Uncle Tobys cereal business in Australia for approximately $385 million. We funded our 50 percent share of the purchase price by making additional advances to and equity contributions in CPW totaling $135 million (classified as investments in affiliates, net, on the Consolidated Statements of Cash Flows) and by acquiring a 50 percent undivided interest in certain intellectual property for $58 million (classified as acquisitions on the Consolidated Statements of Cash Flows). We funded the advances to CPW and our equity contribution from cash generated from our international operations, including our international joint ventures. We have 50 percent equity interests in H agen-Dazs Japan, Inc. and H agen-Dazs Korea Company Limited. We also had a 49 percent equity interest in HD Distributors (Thailand) Company Limited. Subsequent to its fiscal year end, we acquired a controlling interest in this joint venture. These joint ventures manufacture, distribute, and market H agen-Dazs frozen ice cream products and novelties. As noted on page 15, in fiscal 2007, we changed the reporting period for the H agen-Dazs joint ventures. Accordingly, fiscal 2007 results include only 11 months of results from these joint ventures compared to 12 months in fiscal 2006 and 2005. We have a 50 percent equity interest in Seretram, a joint venture for the production of Green Giant canned corn in France. Seretram results are reported as of and for the 12 months ended April 30. On February 28, 2005, SVE was terminated and our 40.5 percent interest was redeemed. Fiscal 2005 after-tax joint venture earnings include our share of the after-tax earnings of SVE through that date. Domestic Joint Venture We have a 50 percent equity interest in 8th Continent, LLC, a joint venture to develop and market soy-based products. 8th Continent results are presented on the same basis as our fiscal year. Our share of after-tax joint venture earnings increased from $69 million in fiscal 2006 to $73 million in fiscal 2007. This growth was largely driven by strong core brand volume and organic net sales growth, new product innovation, and increases in brand-building consumer marketing spending, partially offset by a $2 million impact of the change in reporting period for the H agen-Dazs joint ventures. Our share of after-tax joint venture earnings decreased from $94 million in fiscal 2005 to $69 million in fiscal 2006 reflecting the absence of SVE earnings and the inclusion of $8 million of restructuring costs for CPW in fiscal 2006. The change in net sales for each joint venture is set forth in the following table: Joint Ventures Change in Net Sales Fiscal 2007 vs. 2006 Fiscal 2006 vs. 2005 CPW +18 % +4 % H agen-Dazs (11 months in fiscal 2007 and 12 months in fiscal 2006 and 2005) 7 7 8 th Continent +3 +14 Ongoing Joint Ventures (a) +13 % +2 % (a) Excludes SVE net sales. See page 33 for our discussion of this measure not defined by GAAP. For fiscal 2007, CPW net sales grew by 18 percent reflecting the introduction of new products and favorable currency translation. The acquisition of Uncle Tobys in Australia also contributed 6 points of CPW net sales growth. Net sales for our H agen-Dazs joint ventures declined 7 percent from fiscal 2006, reflecting the change in our reporting period for these joint ventures. IMPACT OF INFLATION We believe that changes in the general rate of inflation have not had a significant effect on profitability over the three most recent fiscal years other than as noted above related to ingredients, packaging, energy, and employee benefit costs. We attempt to minimize the effects of inflation through appropriate planning and operating practices. Our risk management practices are discussed in Item 7A on pages 35 through 36 of this report. LIQUIDITY The primary source of our liquidity is cash flow from operations. Over the most recent three-year period, our operations have generated $5.4 billion in cash. A substantial portion of this operating cash flow has been returned to stockholders annually through share repurchases and dividends. We also use this source of liquidity to fund our annual capital expenditures. We typically use a combination of available cash, notes payable, and long-term debt to finance acquisitions and major capital expansions. 21 Table of Contents Cash Flows from Operations In Millions, for Fiscal Year Ended May 27, 2007 May 28, 2006 May 29, 2005 Net earnings $ 1,144 $ 1,090 $ 1,240 Depreciation and amortization 418 424 443 After-tax earnings from joint ventures (73 ) (69 ) (94 ) Stock-based compensation 128 45 38 Deferred income taxes 26 26 9 Distribution of earnings from joint ventures 45 77 83 Tax benefit on exercised options 41 62 Pension and other postretirement costs (54 ) (74 ) (70 ) Restructuring, impairment and other exit costs 39 30 84 Divestitures (gain) (499 ) Debt repurchase costs 137 Changes in current assets and liabilities 77 184 251 Other, net 15 74 110 Net Cash Provided by Operating Activities $ 1,765 $ 1,848 $ 1,794 Our cash flow from operations decreased $83 million from fiscal 2006 to fiscal 2007 as an increase in net earnings of $54 million and the net benefit to operating cash flow from stock compensation of $42 million were more than offset by a reduction in our cash flows from working capital of $107 million and a $32 million decrease in distributions of earnings from joint ventures. Changes in working capital were a reduced source of cash flow from operations in fiscal 2007 versus fiscal 2006 primarily reflecting a $32 million decrease in cash flows from accounts receivable, and a $69 million reduction in the source of cash from other current liabilities, primarily from a smaller increase in accrued taxes in fiscal 2007 than in fiscal 2006. A key measure that we manage is the growth rate in core working capital. We strive to grow core working capital at or below our growth in net sales. For fiscal 2007, core working capital grew 4 percent, less than our net sales growth of 6 percent. In fiscal 2006, core working capital grew 5 percent, compared to net sales growth of 4 percent, and in fiscal 2005, core working capital decreased 2 percent and net sales grew 2 percent. The increase in cash flows from operations from fiscal 2005 to fiscal 2006 was primarily the result of increases in accrued compensation and accrued income taxes. Cash Flows from Investing Activities In Millions, for Fiscal Year Ended May 27, 2007 May 28, 2006 May 29, 2005 Purchases of land, buildings and equipment $ (460 ) $ (360 ) $ (434 ) Acquisitions (85 ) (26 ) Investments in affiliates, net (100 ) 1 1 Proceeds from disposal of land, buildings and equipment 14 11 24 Proceeds from disposition of businesses 799 Proceeds from dispositions of product lines 14 Other, net 20 5 23 Net Cash Provided (Used) by Investing Activities $ (597 ) $ (369 ) $ 413 In fiscal 2007, capital investment for land, buildings, and equipment increased by $100 million to $460 million, as we increased manufacturing capacity for our snack bars and yogurt products and increased spending on cost-saving projects. We expect capital expenditures to increase to approximately $575 million in fiscal 2008, including projects to: consolidate manufacturing for our Old El Paso business; enhance distribution capabilities at one of our United States plants; increase our yogurt and chewy snack bar manufacturing capacity; and begin an upgrade of our information technology systems in Latin and South America and Asia. During fiscal 2007, we funded our share of CPW acquisition of the Uncle Tobys cereal business in Australia (reflected in acquisitions and investments in affiliates, net) and acquired Saxby Bros. Limited, a chilled pastry company in the United Kingdom. In addition, we completed an acquisition of our master franchisee of H agen-Dazs shops in Greece. We also sold our frozen pie product line, including a plant in Rochester, New York, and our par-baked bread product line, including plants in Chelsea, Massachusetts and Tempe, Arizona. 22 Table of Contents Cash Flows from Financing Activities In Millions, for Fiscal Year Ended May 27, 2007 May 28, 2006 May 29, 2005 Change in notes payable $ (280 ) $ 1,197 $ (1,057 ) Issuance of long-term debt 2,650 2 Payment of long-term debt (2,323 ) (1,386 ) (1,115 ) Proceeds from issuance of preferred membership interests of subsidiary 835 Common stock issued 317 157 195 Tax benefit on exercised options 73 Purchases of common stock for treasury (1,321 ) (885 ) (771 ) Dividends paid (506 ) (485 ) (461 ) Other, net (8 ) (3 ) (13 ) Net Cash Used by Financing Activities $ (1,398 ) $ (1,405 ) $ (2,385 ) Details of each fiscal 2007 financing are described in Note 8 to the Consolidated Financial Statements on pages 54 to 55 of this report. On April 25, 2007, we redeemed or converted all of our zero coupon convertible debentures due 2022. The redemption price was settled in cash. For the debentures that were converted, we delivered cash equal to the accreted value of the debentures, including $23 million of accreted original issue discount, and issued 284,000 shares of our common stock worth $17 million to settle the conversion value in excess of the accreted value. This premium was recorded as a reduction to stockholders equity, net of the applicable tax benefit. There was no gain or loss associated with the redemption or conversions. We used proceeds from the issuance of commercial paper to fund the redemption and conversions. During fiscal 2006, we repurchased a significant portion of these debentures pursuant to put rights of the holders for an aggregate purchase price of $1.33 billion, including $77 million of accreted original issue discount. We incurred no gain or loss from this repurchase. We used proceeds from the issuance of commercial paper to fund the purchase price of the debentures. On April 11, 2007, we issued $1.15 billion aggregate principal amount of floating rate convertible senior notes. The notes bear interest at an annual rate equal to one-month London Interbank Offered Rate (LIBOR) minus 0.07 percent, subject to monthly reset. The notes will mature on April 11, 2037. Each $1,000 note is convertible into ten shares of our common stock, subject to adjustment in certain circumstances, on any business day prior to maturity. Upon conversion, each holder would receive cash up to the calculated principal amount of the note, and cash or shares at our option for any excess conversion value over the calculated principal amount of each note as described in the note agreement. The notes are unsecured and unsubordinated. The holders of the notes may put them to us for cash equal to the principal amount plus accrued and unpaid interest upon any change of control and on April 11, 2008 and several anniversary dates thereafter. We used the proceeds from the notes to repay outstanding commercial paper. Based on the terms of the notes, we expect them to be put to us on April 11, 2008. In January 2007, we issued $1.0 billion of 5.7 percent fixed rate notes due February 15, 2017 and $500 million of floating rate notes due January 22, 2010. The proceeds of these notes were used to retire $1.5 billion of fixed rate notes which matured in February 2007. The floating rate notes bear interest equal to three-month LIBOR plus 0.13 percent, subject to quarterly reset. The floating rate notes cannot be called by us prior to maturity. The fixed rate notes may be called by us at any time for cash equal to the greater of the principal amount of the notes or a specified make-whole amount, plus, in each case, accrued and unpaid interest. We had previously entered into $700 million of pay-fixed, forward-starting interest rate swaps with an average fixed rate of 5.7 percent in anticipation of the fixed rate note refinancing. We are amortizing a loss deferred to accumulated other comprehensive income (loss) of $23 million associated with these derivatives to interest expense on a straight-line basis over the life of the fixed rate notes. We expect to reclassify $2 million of the deferred loss to earnings over the next 12 months. We used cash from operations to repay $189 million of debt in fiscal 2006. In fiscal 2005, we commenced a cash tender offer for our outstanding 6 percent notes due in 2012. The tender offer resulted in the purchase of $500 million principal amount of the notes. Subsequent to the expiration of the tender offer, we purchased an additional $260 million principal amount of the notes in the open market. We incurred a loss of $137 million from this repurchase. In fiscal 2007, our Board of Directors approved a new authorization to repurchase up to 75 million shares of our common stock. This replaced a prior authorization, which permitted us to repurchase shares up to a treasury share balance of 170 million. Purchases under the new authorization can be made in the open market or in privately negotiated transactions, including the use of call options and other derivative instruments, Rule 10b5-1 trading plans, and accelerated repurchase programs. The authorization has no specified termination date. During fiscal 2007, we repurchased 25 million shares for an aggregate purchase price of $1,385 million, of which $64 million settled after the end of our fiscal year. Under the prior authorization in fiscal 2006, we repurchased 19 million shares of common stock for an aggregate purchase price of $892 million. A total of 162 million shares were held in treasury on May 27, 2007. 23 Table of Contents Dividends paid in fiscal 2007 totaled $506 million, or $1.44 per share, a 7.5 percent increase from fiscal 2006 dividends of $1.34 per share. Dividends paid in fiscal 2006 totaled $485 million, or $1.34 per share, an 8 percent increase from fiscal 2005 dividends of $1.24 per share. Our Board of Directors approved a quarterly dividend increase from $0.37 per share to $0.39 per share effective with the dividend payable on August 1, 2007. CAPITAL RESOURCES Capital Structure In Millions May 27, 2007 May 28, 2006 Notes payable $ 1,254 $ 1,503 Current portion of long-term debt 1,734 2,131 Long-term debt 3,218 2,415 Total debt 6,206 6,049 Minority interests 1,139 1,136 Stockholders equity 5,319 5,772 Total Capital $ 12,664 $ 12,957 The following table details the fee-paid committed credit lines we had available as of May 27, 2007: In Billions Amount Credit facility expiring: October 2007 $ 1.10 January 2009 0.75 October 2010 1.10 Total Committed Credit Facilities $ 2.95 Commercial paper is a continuing source of short-term financing. We can issue commercial paper in the United States, Canada, and Europe. Our commercial paper borrowings are supported by $2.95 billion of fee-paid committed credit lines and $351 million in uncommitted lines. As of May 27, 2007, there were no amounts outstanding on the fee-paid committed credit lines and $133 million was drawn on the uncommitted lines, all by our international operations. Our credit facilities, certain of our long-term debt agreements, and our minority interests contain restrictive covenants. As of May 27, 2007, we were in compliance with all of these covenants. We have $1.7 billion of long-term debt maturing in the next 12 months that is classified as current, including $1.25 billion of notes that may mature based on the put rights of the note holders. We believe that cash flows from operations, together with available short- and long-term debt financing, will be adequate to meet our liquidity and capital needs for at least the next 12 months. As of May 27, 2007, our total debt, including the impact of derivative instruments designated as hedges, was 50 percent each in fixed-rate and floating-rate instruments compared to 63 percent fixed-rate and 37 percent floating-rate as of May 28, 2006. The change in the fixed-rate and floating-rate percentages were driven by refinancing our fixed-rate zero coupon convertible debentures in April 2007 with commercial paper and also refinancing $500 million of fixed rate notes that matured in February 2007 with floating rate notes. We have an effective shelf registration statement on file with the Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC) covering the sale of debt securities, common stock, preference stock, depository shares, securities warrants, purchase contracts, purchase units, and units. As of May 27, 2007, $3.7 billion remained available under the shelf registration for future use. We believe that growth in return on average total capital is a key performance measure. Return on average total capital increased from 10.5 percent in fiscal 2006 to 11.1 percent in fiscal 2007 due to earnings growth and disciplined use of cash. We also believe important measures of financial strength are the ratio of fixed charge coverage and the ratio of operating cash flow to debt. Our fixed charge coverage ratio in fiscal 2007 was 4.37 compared to 4.54 in fiscal 2006. The measure declined from fiscal 2006 as a $72 million increase in earnings before income taxes and after-tax earnings from joint ventures was more than offset by the impact of a $32 million decrease in distributions of earnings from joint ventures and a $35 million increase in fixed charges. Our operating cash flow to debt ratio decreased to 28 percent in fiscal 2007 from 31 percent in fiscal 2006, as cash flows from operations declined slightly from fiscal 2006 and year end debt balances increased slightly over the same period. Currently, Standard and Poor (S&P) has ratings of BBB+ on our publicly held long-term debt and A-2 on our commercial paper. Moody Investors Services (Moody s) has ratings of Baa1 for our long-term debt and P-2 for our commercial paper. Fitch Ratings (Fitch) rates our long-term debt BBB+ and our commercial paper F-2. Dominion Bond Rating Service in Canada currently rates us as A-low. These ratings are not a recommendation to buy, sell or hold securities, are subject to revision or withdrawal at any time by the rating organization and should be evaluated independently of any other rating. We intend to maintain these ratings levels for the foreseeable future. Third parties hold minority interests in certain of our subsidiaries. General Mills Cereals, LLC (GMC) owns the manufacturing assets and intellectual property associated with the production and retail sale of Big G ready-to-eat cereals, Progresso soups and Old El Paso products. In May 2002, we sold 150,000 Class A preferred membership interests in GMC to an unrelated third-party investor in exchange for $150 million. In June 2007, we sold an additional 88,851 Class A preferred membership interests in GMC to the same 24 Table of Contents unrelated third-party investor in exchange for $92 million. In October 2004, we sold 835,000 Series B-1 preferred membership interests in GMC to an unrelated third-party investor in exchange for $835 million. The terms of the Series B-1 and Class A interests held by the third-party investors and the rights of those investors are detailed in the Third Amended and Restated Limited Liability Company Agreement of GMC (the LLC Agreement). Currently, we hold all interests in GMC (including all managing member interests), other than the Class A interests and the Series B-1 interests. The Class A interests receive quarterly preferred distributions based on their capital account balance at a floating rate equal to the sum of three-month LIBOR plus 65 basis points. The rate of the distributions on the Class A interests must be adjusted by agreement between the Class A interest holder and GMC, or through a remarketing, every five years. The first adjustment of the rate occurred in June 2007 and the next adjustment is scheduled to occur in July 2012. GMC, through its managing member, may elect to repurchase all of the Class A interests at any time for an amount equal to the holder capital account, plus any unpaid preferred returns and any applicable make-whole amount. Upon a failed remarketing, the rate over LIBOR will be increased by 75 basis points until the next scheduled remarketing, which will occur in 3 month intervals until a successful remarketing. As of May 27, 2007, the capital account balance of the Class A interests held by the unrelated third party was $150 million, and it was $248 million as of June 28, 2007, reflecting the third party purchase of $92 million of additional Class A interests and a $6 million increase in the capital account balance associated with the previously owned interests. The Series B-1 interests of GMC are entitled to receive quarterly preferred distributions based on their capital account balance at a fixed rate of 4.5 percent per year, which is scheduled to be reset to a new fixed rate through a remarketing in August 2007. The capital account balance of the Series B-1 interests was $835 million as of May 27, 2007, and will be increased to $849 million in August 2007 in connection with the remarketing. Beginning in August 2012, we may elect to reset the preferred distribution rate through a remarketing or to repurchase the interests. If we do not conduct a remarketing or repurchase the interests, the preferred distribution rate will be reset to a floating rate. As the managing member of GMC, we may elect to repurchase the Series B-1 interests for an amount equal to the holder then current capital account balance (i) in August 2007 and in five year intervals thereafter, and (ii) on any distribution date during a period in which the preferred return is set at a floating rate. The holders of the Series B-1 interests cannot require us to repurchase the interests. The Series B-1 interests will be exchanged for shares of our perpetual preferred stock as a result of: our senior unsecured debt rating falling below either Ba3 as rated by Moody or BB- as rated by S&P or Fitch; our bankruptcy or liquidation; a default on any of our senior indebtedness resulting in an acceleration of indebtedness having an outstanding principal balance in excess of $50 million; failing to pay a dividend on our common stock in any fiscal quarter; or certain liquidating events described in the LLC Agreement. If GMC fails to make a required distribution to the holders of Series B-1 interests when due, we will be restricted from paying any dividend (other than dividends in the form of shares of common stock) or other distributions on shares of our common or preferred stock, and may not repurchase or redeem shares of our common or preferred stock, until all such accrued and undistributed distributions are paid to the holders of the Series B-1 interests. GMC may be required to be dissolved and liquidated under certain circumstances, including: the bankruptcy of GMC or its subsidiaries; GMC failure to deliver the preferred distributions; GMC failure to comply with portfolio requirements; breaches of certain covenants; lowering of our senior debt rating below either Baa3 by Moody or BBB by S&P; and a failed attempt to remarket the Class A interests as a result of a breach of GMC obligations to assist in such remarketing. In the event of a liquidation of GMC, each member of GMC would receive the amount of its then current capital account balance. As managing member, we may avoid liquidation of GMC in most circumstances by exercising our option to purchase the Class A interests. General Mills Capital, Inc. (GM Capital) was formed for the purpose of purchasing and collecting our receivables and previously sold $150 million of its Series A preferred stock to an unrelated third-party investor. In June 2007, we repurchased all of the Series A preferred stock. We used commercial paper borrowings and proceeds from the sale of the additional interests in GMC to fund the repurchase. In October 2004, Lehman Brothers Holdings, Inc. (Lehman Brothers) issued $750 million of notes that are mandatorily exchangeable for shares of our common stock. In connection with the issuance of those notes, an affiliate of Lehman Brothers entered into a forward purchase contract with us, under which we are obligated to deliver between 14 million and 17 million shares of our common stock, subject to adjustment under certain circumstances. These shares will be deliverable by us in October 2007 in exchange for $750 million of cash, assuming the Series B-1 interests in GMC are remarketed as planned in August 2007. If the remarketing is not successful, we will receive securities of an affiliate of Lehman Brothers. We expect to use the cash we receive from Lehman Brothers to repurchase shares of our stock, or to the 25 Table of Contents extent we have already reached our share repurchase objective for the year, to retire outstanding debt. For financial reporting purposes, the assets, liabilities, results of operations, and cash flows of GMC and GM Capital are included in our Consolidated Financial Statements. The return to the third party investors is reflected in interest, net in the Consolidated Statements of Earnings. The third party investors Class A and Series B-1 interests in GMC are classified as minority interests on our Consolidated Balance Sheets. We may also call these instruments in exchange for a payment equal to the then-current capital account value, plus any unpaid preferred return and any applicable make-whole amount. We may only call the Series B-1 interests in connection with a remarketing or on distribution dates in the event of a floating rate period. If we repurchase these interests, any change in the unrelated third party investors capital accounts from their original value will be charged directly to retained earnings and will increase or decrease the net earnings used to calculate EPS in that period. See Note 9 to the Consolidated Financial Statements on pages 56 and 57 in Item 8 for more information regarding our minority interests. OFF-BALANCE SHEET ARRANGEMENTS AND CONTRACTUAL OBLIGATIONS As of May 27, 2007, we have issued guarantees and comfort letters of $606 million for the debt and other obligations of consolidated subsidiaries, and guarantees and comfort letters of $266 million for the debt and other obligations of non-consolidated affiliates, primarily CPW. In addition, off-balance sheet arrangements are generally limited to the future payments under noncancelable operating leases, which totaled $279 million as of May 27, 2007. As of May 27, 2007, we had invested in 5 VIEs. We are the PB of GM Capital, a subsidiary that we consolidate. As discussed previously, in June 2007 we repurchased its outstanding securities. We have an interest in a contract manufacturer at our former facility in Geneva, Illinois. We are the PB and have consolidated this entity as of May 27, 2007. This entity had property and equipment with a fair value of $37 million and long-term debt of $37 million as of May 27, 2007. We also have an interest in a contract manufacturer in Greece that is a VIE. Although we are the PB, we have not consolidated this entity because it is not material to our results of operations, financial condition, or liquidity as of May 27, 2007. This entity had assets of $3 million and liabilities of $1 million as of May 27, 2007. We are not the PB of the remaining 2 VIEs. Following our repurchase of the GM Capital preferred stock, our maximum exposure to loss from the remaining 4 VIEs is limited to the $37 million of long-term debt of the contract manufacturer in Geneva, Illinois and our $3 million equity investments in two of the other VIEs. On August 17, 2006, the Pension Protection Act (PPA) became law in the United States. The PPA revised the basis and methodology for determining defined benefit plan minimum funding requirements as well as maximum contributions to and benefits paid from tax-qualified plans. Most of these provisions are first applicable to our domestic defined benefit pension plans in fiscal 2008 on a phased-in basis. The PPA may ultimately require us to make additional contributions to our domestic plans. However, due to our historical funding practices and current funded status, we do not expect to have significant statutory or contractual funding requirements for our major defined benefit plans during the next several years. No 2008 domestic plan contributions are currently expected. Actual 2008 contributions could exceed our current projections, and may be influenced by our decision to undertake discretionary funding of our benefit trusts versus other competing investment priorities, or by future changes in government requirements. Additionally, our projections concerning timing of the PPA funding requirements are subject to change and may be influenced by factors such as general market conditions affecting trust asset performance, interest rates and our future decisions regarding certain elective provisions of the PPA. The following table summarizes our future estimated cash payments under existing contractual obligations, including payments due by period. Payments Due by Fiscal Year In Millions Total 2008 2009-10 2011-12 2013 and Thereafter Long-term debt (a) $ 4,942 $ 1,728 $ 818 $ 1,252 $ 1,144 Accrued interest 165 165 Operating leases 279 74 117 51 37 Capital leases 28 8 7 5 8 Purchase obligations 2,403 2,148 153 66 36 Total $ 7,817 $ 4,123 $ 1,095 $ 1,374 $ 1,225 (a) Excludes $23 million related to capital leases and $13 million of bond premium and dealer discount. Principal payments due on long-term debt are based on stated contractual maturities or put rights of certain note holders. The majority of the purchase obligations represent commitments for raw material and packaging to be utilized in the normal course of business and for consumer marketing spending commitments that support our brands. The fair value of our interest rate and equity swaps was a payable of $154 million as of May 27, 2007, based on fair market values as of that date. Future changes in market values will impact the amount of cash ultimately paid or received to settle those instruments in the future. Other long-term obligations 26 Table of Contents primarily consist of liabilities for uncertain income tax positions, accrued compensation and benefits, including the underfunded status of certain of our defined benefit pension, other postretirement benefit, and postemployment benefit plans, and miscellaneous liabilities. We expect to pay $24 million of benefits from our unfunded postemployment benefit plans in fiscal 2008. Further information on all of these plans is included in Note 13 to the Consolidated Financial Statements appearing on pages 61 through 65 in Item 8 of this report. SIGNIFICANT ACCOUNTING ESTIMATES For a complete description of our significant accounting policies, see Note 2 to the Consolidated Financial Statements appearing on pages 43 through 47 in Item 8 of this report. Our significant accounting estimates are those that have meaningful impact on the reporting of our financial condition and results of operations. These policies include our accounting for promotional expenditures, intangible assets, stock compensation, income taxes, and defined benefit pension, other postretirement and postemployment benefits. PROMOTIONAL EXPENDITURES Our promotional activities are conducted through our customers and directly or indirectly with end consumers. These activities include: payments to customers to perform merchandising activities on our behalf, such as advertising or in-store displays; discounts to our list prices to lower retail shelf prices and payments to gain distribution of new products; coupons, contests, and other incentives; and media and advertising expenditures. The media and advertising expenditures are recognized as expense when the advertisement airs. The cost of payments to customers and other consumer activities are recognized as the related revenue is recorded, which generally precedes the actual cash expenditure. The recognition of these costs requires estimation of customer participation and performance levels. These estimates are made based on the forecasted customer sales, the timing and forecasted costs of promotional activities, and other factors. Differences between estimated expenses and actual costs are normally insignificant and are recognized as a change in management estimate in a subsequent period. Our accrued trade, coupon, and brand-building consumer marketing liabilities were $289 million as of May 27, 2007, and $294 million as of May 28, 2006. Because our total promotional expenditures (including amounts classified as a reduction of revenues) are significant, if our estimates are inaccurate we would have to make adjustments that could have a material effect on our results of operations. Our unit volume in the last week of a quarter can be higher than the average for the preceding weeks of the quarter in certain circumstances. In comparison to the average daily shipments in the first 12 weeks of a quarter, the final week of each quarter may have as much as two to four days worth of incremental shipments (based on a five-day week), reflecting increased promotional activity at the end of the quarter. This increased activity includes promotions to assure that our customers have sufficient inventory on hand to support major marketing events or increased seasonal demand early in the next quarter, as well as promotions intended to help achieve interim unit volume targets. If, due to quarter-end promotions or other reasons, our customers purchase more product in any reporting period than end-consumer demand will require in future periods, our sales level in future reporting periods could be adversely affected. INTANGIBLE ASSETS Goodwill represents the difference between the purchase price of acquired companies and the related fair values of net assets acquired. Goodwill is not subject to amortization and is tested for impairment annually and whenever events or changes in circumstances indicate that impairment may have occurred. Impairment testing is performed for each of our reporting units. We compare the carrying value of a reporting unit, including goodwill, to the fair value of the unit. Carrying value is based on the assets and liabilities associated with the operations of that reporting unit, which often requires allocation of shared or corporate items among reporting units. If the carrying amount of a reporting unit exceeds its fair value, we revalue all assets and liabilities of the reporting unit, excluding goodwill, to determine if the fair value of the net assets is greater than the net assets including goodwill. If the fair value of the net assets is less than the net assets including goodwill, impairment has occurred. Our estimates of fair value are determined based on a discounted cash flow model. Growth rates for sales and profits are determined using inputs from our annual long-range planning process. We also make estimates of discount rates, perpetuity growth assumptions, market comparables, and other factors. We periodically engage third-party valuation consultants to assist in this process. During fiscal 2007, we changed the timing of our annual goodwill impairment testing from the first day of our fiscal year to December 1. This accounting change is preferable because it better aligns this impairment test with the timing of the presentation of our strategic long-range plan to the Board of Directors. During fiscal 2007, we performed this annual impairment test on May 29, 2006, and again on December 1, 2006. The fair values for all of our reporting units exceed their carrying values by at least 20 percent. We evaluate the useful lives of our other intangible assets, primarily intangible assets associated with the Pillsbury, Totino s, Progresso, Green Giant , Old El Paso and H agen-Dazs brands, to determine if they are finite or indefinite-lived. Reaching a determination on useful life requires 27 Table of Contents significant judgments and assumptions regarding the future effects of obsolescence, demand, competition, other economic factors (such as the stability of the industry, known technological advances, legislative action that results in an uncertain or changing regulatory environment, and expected changes in distribution channels), the level of required maintenance expenditures, and the expected lives of other related groups of assets. Our indefinite-lived intangible assets, primarily brands, are also tested for impairment annually and whenever events or changes in circumstances indicate that their carrying value may not be recoverable. We performed our fiscal 2007 assessment of our brand intangibles as of December 1, 2006. Our estimate of the fair value of the brands was based on a discounted cash flow model using inputs which included: projected revenues from our annual long-range plan; assumed royalty rates that could be payable if we did not own the brands; and a discount rate. We periodically engage third-party valuation consultants to assist in this process. All brand intangibles had fair values in excess of their carrying values by at least 20 percent, except for the Pillsbury brand, which we estimated had a fair value less than 3 percent higher than its carrying value. This brand comprises nearly one-half of our total indefinite-lived intangible assets. If the growth rate for the global revenue from all uses of the Pillsbury brand decreases 50 basis points from the current planned growth rate, fair value would be reduced by approximately $165 million, assuming all other components of the fair value estimate remain unchanged. If the assumed royalty rate for all uses of the Pillsbury brand decreases by 50 basis points, fair value would be reduced by approximately $130 million, assuming all other components of the fair value estimate remain unchanged. If the applicable discount rate increases by 50 basis points, fair value of the Pillsbury brand would be reduced by approximately $175 million, assuming all other components of the fair value estimate remain unchanged. As of May 27, 2007, we reviewed each of the assumptions used in the annual impairment assessment performed as of December 1, 2006, and found them to still be appropriate. As of May 27, 2007, we had $10.5 billion of goodwill and indefinite-lived intangible assets. While we currently believe that the fair value of each intangible exceeds its carrying value and that those intangibles so classified will contribute indefinitely to our cash flows, materially different assumptions regarding future performance of our businesses could result in significant impairment losses and amortization expense. STOCK COMPENSATION Effective May 29, 2006, we adopted SFAS 123R, which changed the accounting for compensation expense associated with stock options, restricted stock awards, and other forms of equity compensation. We elected the modified prospective transition method as permitted by SFAS 123R; accordingly, results from prior periods have not been restated. Under this method, stock-based compensation expense for fiscal 2007 was $128 million, which included amortization related to the remaining unvested portion of all equity compensation awards granted prior to May 29, 2006, based on the grant-date fair value estimated in accordance with the original provisions of SFAS No. 123, Accounting for Stock-Based Compensation (SFAS 123), and amortization related to all equity compensation awards granted on or subsequent to May 29, 2006, based on the grant-date fair value estimated in accordance with the provisions of SFAS 123R. The incremental effect on net earnings in fiscal 2007 of our adoption of SFAS 123R was $69 million of expense ($43 million after-tax). All our stock compensation expense is recorded in SG&A expense in the Consolidated Statement of Earnings. Prior to May 29, 2006, we used the intrinsic value method for measuring the cost of compensation paid in our common stock. No compensation expense for stock options was recognized in our Consolidated Statements of Earnings prior to fiscal 2007, as the exercise price was equal to the market price of our stock at the date of grant. Expense attributable to other types of share-based awards was recognized in our results under SFAS 123. The weighted-average grant-date fair values of the employee stock options granted were estimated as $10.74 in fiscal 2007, $8.04 in fiscal 2006, and $8.32 in fiscal 2005 using the Black-Scholes option-pricing model with the following assumptions: Fiscal Year 2007 2006 2005 Risk-free interest rate 5.3% 4.3% 4.0% Expected term 8 years 7 years 7 years Expected volatility 19.7% 20.0% 21.0% Dividend yield 2.8% 2.9% 2.7% The valuation of stock options is a significant accounting estimate which requires us to use significant judgments and assumptions that are likely to have a material impact on our financial statements. Annually, we make predictive assumptions regarding future stock price volatility, employee exercise behavior, and dividend yield. Our methods for selecting these valuation assumptions are explained in Note 11 to the Consolidated Financial Statements on pages 58 through 60 in Item 8 of this report. For fiscal 2007 and all prior periods, our estimate of expected stock price volatility is based on historical volatility determined on a daily basis over the expected term of the options. We considered but did not use implied volatility because we believed historical volatility provided an appropriate expectation for our volatility in the future. If all other assumptions are held constant, a one percentage point increase or decrease in our fiscal 2007 volatility assumption 28 Table of Contents would increase or decrease the grant-date fair value of our fiscal 2007 option awards by 4 percent. For our fiscal 2008 annual option grant made in June 2007, we have included implied volatility in our determination of expected volatility. We have weighted implied volatility and historical volatility equally in determining our volatility assumption. We have included implied volatility in our determination of this assumption because exchange-traded options on our stock are widely traded, and we believe the implied volatility placed on our stock by the marketplace is a reasonable indicator of expected future volatility in our stock price. We have more heavily weighted the last several years of historical volatility data to reflect a significant decrease in both our historical and our implied volatility trends following our completion of the Pillsbury acquisition in October 2001 and our operating results thereafter. Our expected term represents the period of time that options granted are expected to be outstanding based on historical data to estimate option exercise and employee termination within the valuation model. Separate groups of employees have similar historical exercise behavior and therefore were aggregated into a single pool for valuation purposes. The weighted-average expected term for all employee groups is presented in the table above. A change in the expected term of 1 year, leaving all other assumptions constant, would not change the grant date fair value by more than 3 percent. Our valuation model assumes that dividends and our share price increase in line with earnings, resulting in a constant dividend yield. The risk-free interest rate for periods during the expected term of the options is based on the U.S. Treasury zero-coupon yield curve in effect at the time of grant. To the extent that actual outcomes differ from our assumptions, we are not required to true up grant-date fair value-based expense to final intrinsic values. However, these differences can impact the classification of cash tax benefits realized upon exercise of stock options, as explained in the following two paragraphs. Furthermore, historical data has a significant bearing on our forward-looking assumptions. Significant variances between actual and predicted experience could lead to prospective revisions in our assumptions, which could then significantly impact the year-over-year comparability of stock-based compensation expense. SFAS 123R also provides that any corporate income tax benefit realized upon exercise or vesting of an award in excess of that previously recognized in earnings (referred to as a windfall tax benefit ) is presented in the Consolidated Statement of Cash Flows as a financing (rather than an operating) cash flow. If this standard had been adopted in fiscal 2006, operating cash flow would have been lower (and financing cash flow would have been higher) by $41 million as a result of this provision. For fiscal 2007, the windfall tax benefits classified as financing cash flow were $73 million. The actual impact on future years financing cash flow will depend, in part, on the volume of employee stock option exercises during a particular year and the relationship between the exercise-date market value of the underlying stock and the original grant-date fair value previously determined for financial reporting purposes. For balance sheet classification purposes, realized windfall tax benefits are credited to additional paid-in capital within the Consolidated Balance Sheet. Realized shortfall tax benefits (amounts which are less than that previously recognized in earnings) are first offset against the cumulative balance of windfall tax benefits, if any, and then charged directly to income tax expense, potentially resulting in volatility in our consolidated effective income tax rate. Under the transition rules for adopting SFAS 123R using the modified prospective method, we were permitted to calculate a cumulative amount of windfall tax benefits from post-1995 fiscal years for the purpose of accounting for future shortfall tax benefits. We completed such study prior to the first period of adoption and currently have sufficient cumulative windfall tax benefits to absorb projected arising shortfalls, such that we do not currently expect fiscal 2008 earnings to be affected by this provision. However, as employee stock option exercise behavior is not within our control, it is possible that materially different reported results could occur if different assumptions or conditions were to prevail. INCOME TAXES Our consolidated effective income tax rate is influenced by tax planning opportunities available to us in the various jurisdictions in which we operate. Management judgment is involved in determining our effective tax rate and in evaluating the ultimate resolution of any uncertain tax positions. We are periodically under examination or engaged in a tax controversy. We establish reserves in a variety of taxing jurisdictions when, despite our belief that our tax return positions are supportable, we believe that certain positions may be challenged and may need to be revised. We adjust these reserves in light of changing facts and circumstances, such as the progress of a tax audit. Our effective income tax rate includes the impact of reserve provisions and changes to those reserves. We also provide interest on these reserves at the appropriate statutory interest rate. These interest charges are also included in our effective tax rate. As of May 27, 2007, our income tax and related interest reserves recorded in other current liabilities were slightly more than $700 million. Reserve adjustments for individual issues have generally not exceeded 1 percent of earnings before income taxes and after-tax earnings from joint ventures annually. Nevertheless, the accumulation of individually insignificant discrete adjustments throughout a particular year has historically impacted our consolidated effective income tax rate by up to 80 basis points. 29 Table of Contents The Internal Revenue Service (IRS) recently concluded field examinations for our 2002 and 2003 federal tax years. These examinations included review of our determinations of cost basis, capital losses, and the depreciation of tangible assets and amortization of intangible assets arising from our acquisition of Pillsbury and the sale of minority interests in our GMC subsidiary. The IRS has proposed adjustments related to a majority of the tax benefits associated with these items. We believe we have meritorious defenses and intend to vigorously defend our positions. Our potential liability for this matter is significant and, notwithstanding our reserves against this potential liability, an unfavorable resolution could have a material adverse impact on our results of operations or cash flows from operations. DEFINED BENEFIT PENSION, OTHER POSTRETIREMENT, AND POSTEMPLOYMENT BENEFIT PLANS We have defined benefit pension plans covering most domestic, Canadian, and United Kingdom employees. Benefits for salaried employees are based on length of service and final average compensation. Benefits for hourly employees include various monthly amounts for each year of credited service. Our funding policy is consistent with the requirements of applicable laws. We made $11 million of voluntary contributions to these plans in fiscal 2007. Our principal domestic retirement plan covering salaried employees has a provision that any excess pension assets would vest if the plan is terminated within five years of a change in control. We also sponsor plans that provide health care benefits to the majority of our domestic and Canadian retirees. The salaried health care benefit plan is contributory, with retiree contributions based on years of service. We fund related trusts for certain employees and retirees on an annual basis and made $50 million of voluntary contributions to these plans in fiscal 2007. Under certain circumstances, we also provide accruable benefits to former or inactive employees in the United States and Canada and members of our Board of Directors, including severance, long-term disability, and certain other benefits payable upon death. We recognize an obligation for any of these benefits that vest or accumulate with service. Postemployment benefits that do not vest or accumulate with service (such as severance based solely on annual pay rather than years of service) are charged to expense when incurred. Our postemployment benefit plans are unfunded. We account for our defined benefit pension, other postretirement, and postemployment benefit plans in accordance with SFAS No. 87, Employers Accounting for Pensions, SFAS No. 106, Employers Accounting for Postretirement Benefits Other than Pensions, and SFAS No. 112, Employers Accounting for Postemployment Benefits An Amendment of FASB Statements No. 5 and 43, in measuring plan assets and benefit obligations and in determining the amount of net periodic benefit cost, and SFAS 158, which was issued in September 2006 and is effective for us as of May 27, 2007. SFAS 158 requires employers to recognize the underfunded or overfunded status of a defined benefit postretirement plan as an asset or liability and recognize changes in the funded status in the year in which the changes occur through accumulated other comprehensive income (loss), which is a component of stockholders equity. As a result of the implementation of SFAS 158, we recognized an after-tax decrease in accumulated other comprehensive income (loss) of $440 million for all of our defined benefit pension, other postretirement, and postemployment benefit plans. This includes the incremental impact of recognizing our share of the underfunded status of CPW's defined benefit pension plan in the United Kingdom. Prior periods were not restated. We recognize benefits provided during retirement or following employment over the plan participants active working life. Accordingly, we make various assumptions to predict and measure costs and obligations many years prior to the settlement of our obligations. Assumptions that require significant management judgment and have a material impact on the measurement of our net periodic benefit expense or income and accumulated benefit obligations include the long-term rates of return on plan assets, the interest rates used to discount the obligations for our benefit plans, and the health care cost trend rates. Expected Rate of Return on Plan Assets Our expected rate of return on plan assets is determined by our asset allocation, our historical long-term investment performance, our estimate of future long-term returns by asset class (using input from our actuaries, investment services, and investment managers), and long-term inflation assumptions. We review this assumption annually for each plan, however, our annual investment performance for one particular year does not, by itself, significantly influence our evaluation. Our expected rates of return are revised only when our future investment performance based on our asset allocations, investment strategies, or capital markets change significantly. The investment objective for our defined benefit pension and other postretirement benefit plans is to secure the benefit obligations to participants at a reasonable cost to us. Our goal is to optimize the long-term return on plan assets at a moderate level of risk. The defined benefit pension and other postretirement portfolios are broadly diversified across asset classes. Within asset classes, the portfolios are further diversified across investment styles and investment organizations. For the defined benefit pension and other postretirement benefit plans, the long-term investment policy allocations are: 30 percent to equities in the United States; 20 percent to international equities; 10 percent to private equities; 30 30 Table of Contents percent to fixed income; and 10 percent to real assets (real estate, energy and timber). The actual allocations to these asset classes may vary tactically around the long-term policy allocations based on relative market valuations. Our historical investment returns (compound annual growth rates) for our United States defined benefit pension and other postretirement plan assets were 18 percent, 14 percent, 11 percent, 12 percent, and 12 percent for the 1, 5, 10, 15, and 20 year periods ended May 27, 2007. For fiscal 2007, we assumed, on a weighted-average basis for all defined benefit plans, a rate of return of 9.4 percent. For fiscal 2006 and 2005, we assumed, on a weighted-average basis for all defined benefit plan assets, a rate of return of 9.6 percent. Our principal defined benefit pension and other postretirement plans in the United States have an expected return on plan assets of 9.6 percent. During fiscal 2007, we lowered the expected rate of return on one of our other postretirement plans in the United States based on costs associated with insurance contracts owned by that plan. Lowering the expected long-term rate of return on assets by 50 basis points would increase our net pension and postretirement expense by $20 million for fiscal 2008. A 50 basis point shortfall between the assumed and actual rate of return on plan assets for fiscal 2008 would result in a similar amount of arising asset-experience loss. Any arising asset-experience loss is recognized on a market-related valuation basis, which reduces year-to-year volatility. This market-related valuation recognizes investment gains or losses over a five-year period from the year in which they occur. Investment gains or losses for this purpose are the difference between the expected return calculated using the market-related value of assets and the actual return based on the market-related value of assets. Since the market-related value of assets recognizes gains or losses over a five-year period, the future value of assets will be impacted as previously deferred gains or losses are recorded. Our outside actuaries perform these calculations as part of our determination of annual expense or income. Discount Rates Our discount rate assumptions are determined annually as of the last day of our fiscal year for all of our defined benefit pension, other postretirement, and postemployment benefit plan obligations. Those same discount rates also are used to determine defined benefit pension, other postretirement, and postemployment benefit plan income and expense for the following fiscal year. We work with our actuaries to determine the timing and amount of expected future cash outflows to plan participants and, using AA-rated corporate bond yields, to develop a forward interest rate curve, including a margin to that index based on our credit risk. This forward interest rate curve is applied to our expected future cash outflows to determine our discount rate assumptions. Our weighted-average discount rates were as follows: Weighted-Average Discount Rates Defined Benefit Pension Plans Other Postretirement Benefit Plans Postemployment Benefit Plans Obligation as of May 27, 2007, and fiscal 2008 expense 6.18 % 6.15 % 6.05 % Obligation as of May 28, 2006, and fiscal 2007 expense 6.45 % 6.50 % 6.44 % Fiscal 2006 expense 5.55 % 5.50 % 5.55 % Lowering the discount rates by 50 basis points would increase our net defined benefit pension, other postretirement, and postemployment benefit plan expense for fiscal 2008 by approximately $28 million. All obligation-related experience gains and losses are amortized using a straight-line method over the average remaining service period of active plan participants. Health Care Cost Trend Rates We review our health care trend rates annually. Our review is based on data and information we collect about our health care claims experience and information provided by our actuaries. This information includes recent plan experience, plan design, overall industry experience and projections, and assumptions used by other similar organizations. Our initial health care cost trend rate is adjusted as necessary to remain consistent with this review, recent experiences, and short-term expectations. Our current health care cost trend rate assumption is 11 percent for retirees age 65 and over and 10 percent for retirees under age 65. These rates are graded down annually until the ultimate trend rate of 5.2 percent is reached in 2015 for retirees over age 65 and 2014 for retirees under age 65. The trend rates are applicable for calculations only if the retirees benefits increase as a result of health care inflation. The ultimate trend rate is adjusted annually, as necessary, to approximate the current economic view on the rate of long-term inflation plus an appropriate health care cost premium. Assumed trend rates for health care costs have an important effect on the amounts reported for the other postretirement benefit plans. 31 Table of Contents A one percentage point change in the health care cost trend rate would have the following effects: In Millions One Percentage Point Increase One Percentage Point Decrease Effect on the aggregate of the service and interest cost components in fiscal 2008 $ 7 $ (7 ) Effect on the other postretirement accumulated benefit obligation as of May 27, 2007 89 (78 ) Any arising health care claims cost-related experience gain or loss is recognized in the calculation of expected future claims. Once recognized, experience gains and losses are amortized using a straight-line method over 15 years, resulting in at least the minimum amortization required being recorded. Financial Statement Impact In fiscal 2007, we recorded net defined benefit pension, other postretirement, and postemployment benefit plan expense of $36 million compared to $25 million in fiscal 2006 and $6 million in fiscal 2005. As of May 27, 2007, we had cumulative unrecognized actuarial net losses of $407 million on our pension plans, $269 million on our other postretirement benefit plans, and $2 million on our postemployment benefit plans, primarily as the result of decreases in our discount rate assumptions. These unrecognized actuarial net losses will result in decreases in our future pension income and increases in postretirement expense since they currently exceed the corridors defined by GAAP. As of May 27, 2007, we changed to the Retirement Plans (RP) 2000 Mortality Table projected forward to 2007 for calculating the fiscal 2007 year end defined benefit pension, other postretirement, and postemployment benefit obligations and fiscal 2008 expense. The impact of this change increased our defined benefit pension obligations by $2 million and had no impact on any of our other plans. The change also increased fiscal 2008 defined benefit pension expenses by $1 million. Actual future net defined benefit pension, other postretirement, and postemployment benefit plan income or expense will depend on investment performance, changes in future discount rates, changes in health care trend rates, and various other factors related to the populations participating in these plans. RECENTLY ISSUED ACCOUNTING PRONOUNCEMENTS In the first quarter of fiscal 2008, we will adopt Financial Accounting Standards Board (FASB) Interpretation No. 48, Accounting for Uncertainty in Income Taxes (FIN 48). Among other things, FIN 48 requires application of a more likely than not threshold to the recognition and derecognition of tax positions. For the periods presented, our policy was to establish reserves that reflected the probable outcome of known tax contingencies. Favorable resolution was recognized as a reduction to our effective tax rate in the period of resolution. As compared to a contingency approach, FIN 48 is based on a benefit recognition model, which we believe could result in a greater amount of benefit (and a lower amount of reserve) being initially recognized in certain circumstances. Provided that the tax position is deemed more likely than not of being sustained, FIN 48 permits a company to recognize the largest amount of tax benefit that is greater than 50 percent likely of being ultimately realized upon settlement. The tax position must be derecognized when it is no longer more likely than not of being sustained. It further requires that a change in judgment related to prior years tax positions be recognized in the quarter of such change. We anticipate $705 million of our accrued income taxes will be reclassified as long-term liabilities upon adoption. Significant tax reserve adjustments impacting our effective tax rate would be separately presented in the rate reconciliation table of Note 14 to the Consolidated Financial Statements appearing on pages 65 through 66 in Item 8 of this report. We are currently evaluating the impact of adopting FIN 48. In June 2007, the FASB approved the issuance of Emerging Issues Task Force Issue No. 06-11 Accounting for Income Tax Benefits of Dividends on Share-Based Payment Awards (EITF 06-11). EITF 06-11 requires that tax benefits from dividends paid on unvested restricted shares be charged directly to stockholders equity instead of benefiting income tax expense. EITF 06-11, which will be effective for us in the first quarter of fiscal 2009, is expected to increase our effective income tax rate by 20 basis points, or from 34.3 percent to 34.5 percent based on our actual 2007 effective tax rate. In February 2007, the FASB issued SFAS No. 159, The Fair Value Option for Financial Assets and Financial Liabilities Including an Amendment of SFAS No. 115 (SFAS 159). This statement provides companies with an option to measure, at specified election dates, many financial instruments and certain other items at fair value that are not currently measured at fair value. A company that adopts SFAS 159 will report unrealized gains and losses on items for which the fair value option has been elected in earnings at each subsequent reporting date. This statement also establishes presentation and disclosure requirements designed to facilitate comparisons between entities that choose different measurement attributes for similar types of assets and liabilities. This statement is effective for fiscal years beginning after November 15, 2007, which for us is the first quarter of fiscal 2009. We do not believe that the adoption of SFAS 159 will have a material impact on our results of operations or financial condition. 32 Table of Contents In September 2006, the FASB issued SFAS No. 157, Fair Value Measurements (SFAS 157). This statement provides a single definition of fair value, a framework for measuring fair value, and expanded disclosures concerning fair value. Previously, different definitions of fair value were contained in various accounting pronouncements creating inconsistencies in measurement and disclosures. SFAS 157 applies under those previously issued pronouncements that prescribe fair value as the relevant measure of value, except SFAS 123R and related interpretations and pronouncements that require or permit measurement similar to fair value but are not intended to measure fair value. This pronouncement is effective for fiscal years beginning after November 15, 2007, which for us is the first quarter of fiscal 2009. We are evaluating the impact of SFAS 157 on our results of operations and financial condition. In September 2006, the SEC released Staff Accounting Bulletin No. 108, Considering the Effects of Prior Year Misstatements when Quantifying Misstatements in Current Year Financial Statements (SAB 108). SAB 108 provides interpretive guidance on the process and diversity in practice of quantifying financial statement misstatements resulting in the potential carryover of improper amounts on the balance sheet. The SEC staff believes that registrants should quantify errors using both a balance sheet and income statement approach and evaluate whether either approach results in quantifying a misstatement that, when all relevant quantitative and qualitative factors are considered, is material. SAB 108 is effective for us in the first quarter of fiscal 2008. We do not believe that the adoption of SAB 108 will have a material impact on our results of operations or financial condition. NON-GAAP MEASURES We have included in this report measures of financial performance that are not defined by GAAP. For each of these non-GAAP financial measures, we are providing below a reconciliation of the differences between the non-GAAP measure and the most directly comparable GAAP measure, an explanation of why our management or the Board of Directors believes the non-GAAP measure provides useful information to investors, and any additional purposes for which our management or Board of Directors uses the non-GAAP measure. These non-GAAP measures should be viewed in addition to, and not in lieu of, the comparable GAAP measure. TOTAL SEGMENT OPERATING PROFIT This non-GAAP measure is used in reporting to our executive management and as a component of the Board of Directors measurement of our performance for incentive compensation purposes. Management and the Board of Directors believe that this measure provides useful information to investors because it is the profitability measure we use to evaluate segment performance. A reconciliation of this measure to operating profit, the relevant GAAP measure, is included in Note 16 to the Consolidated Financial Statements included on pages 67 through 68 in Item 8 of this report. ONGOING JOINT VENTURES Our interest in SVE was redeemed in February 2005. To view the performance of our joint ventures on an ongoing basis, we have provided certain information excluding SVE. The reconciliation of this non-GAAP measure is shown in the following tables: In Millions, Fiscal Year 2007 2006 2005 After-tax earnings from joint ventures: As reported $ 73 $ 69 $ 94 Less: SVE (28 ) Ongoing joint ventures $ 73 $ 69 $ 66 Net sales of joint ventures (100% basis): As reported $ 2,016 $ 1,796 $ 2,652 Less: SVE (896 ) Ongoing joint ventures $ 2,016 $ 1,796 $ 1,756 Fiscal Year 2007 vs. 2006 2006 vs. 2005 Change in net sales of joint ventures (100% basis): As reported +13 % 32 % Ongoing joint ventures +13 % +2 % 33 Table of Contents RETURN ON AVERAGE TOTAL CAPITAL This ratio is not defined by GAAP, and is used in internal management reporting and as a component of the Board of Directors rating of our performance for management and employee incentive compensation. Management and the Board of Directors believe that this measure provides useful information to investors because it is important for assessing the utilization of capital.
