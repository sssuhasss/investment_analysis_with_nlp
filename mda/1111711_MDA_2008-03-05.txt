ITEM 7. MANAGEMENT S DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS OF FINANCIAL CONDITION AND RESULTS OF OPERATIONS (continued) NiSource Inc. Other Operations (continued) Environmental Matters Currently, various environmental matters impact the Other Operations segment. As of December 31, 2007, reserves have been recorded to cover probable environmental response actions. Refer to Note 18-E, Environmental Matters, in the Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements for additional information regarding environmental matters for the Other Operations segment. Net Revenues For the year ended 2007, net revenues were $65.8 million, an increase of $29.6 million from 2006. The increase was a result of higher revenues from the Whiting Clean Energy facility of $30.5 million. As described previously, Whiting Clean Energy and BP signed a definitive agreement in December 2006 redefining the terms under which Whiting Clean Energy provides steam to BP for its oil refining process. For the year ended 2006, net revenues were $36.2 million, a decrease of $5.9 million from 2005. The decrease was mainly due to decreased revenues from the operation of the Whiting Clean Energy facility partially offset by increased commercial and industrial gas marketing revenues of $2.1 million. Operating Income or Loss The Other Operations segment reported operating income of $8.1 million in 2007 compared to an operating loss of $40.2 million for 2006 due to higher revenues associated with Whiting Clean Energy described above, and the impact of contract termination costs with BP of $17.0 million accrued in the fourth quarter of 2006. The Other Operations segment reported an operating loss of $40.2 million in 2006, an increased loss of $27.9 million from the 2005 period, due to increased losses associated with Whiting Clean Energy, including contract termination costs with BP of $17.0 million accrued in the fourth quarter of 2006 and increased scheduled maintenance costs of $7.2 million for Whiting Clean Energy, partially offset by a reduction in uncollectible accounts of $4.0 million and $2.1 million of increased revenues from commercial and industrial gas marketing. 63
