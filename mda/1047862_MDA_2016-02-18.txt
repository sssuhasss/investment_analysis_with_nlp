Operating revenues increased $52 million in 2014 compared with 2013 due primarily to higher purchased power expenses ($21 million) and higher revenues from the New York electric rate plan ($17 million). Purchased power expenses increased $21 million in 2014 compared with 2013 due to an increase in unit costs ($26 million), offset by a decrease in purchased volumes ($5 million). Other operations and maintenance expenses increased $13 million due primarily to an increase in surcharges for assessments and fees that are collected in revenues from customers ($5 million), increase in storm costs ($3 million) and higher healthcare costs ($1 million). Depreciation and amortization increased $5 million due primarily to higher electric utility plant balances. Taxes, other than income taxes decreased $2 million principally due to lower state revenue taxes. Gas O&R results of gas operations for the year ended December 31, 2014 compared with the year ended December 31, 2013 is as follows: For the Years Ended December 31, (Millions of Dollars) 2014 2013 Variation Operating revenues $212 $205 $7 Gas purchased for resale 88 76 12 Other operations and maintenance 67 64 3 Depreciation and amortization 15 15 Taxes, other than income taxes 17 17 Gas operating income $25 $33 $(8) 59 Table of Contents O&R gas sales and deliveries, excluding off-system sales, in 2014 compared with 2013 were: Thousands of Dt Delivered Revenues in Millions (a) For the Years Ended For the Years Ended Description December 31, 2014 December 31, 2013 Variation Percent Variation December 31, 2014 December 31, 2013 Variation Percent Variation Residential 7,786 7,253 533 7.3 % $101 $97 $4 4.1 % General 1,743 1,555 188 12.1 20 18 2 11.1 Firm transportation 12,592 12,062 530 4.4 75 77 (2) (2.6 ) Total firm sales and transportation 22,121 20,870 1,251 6.0 (b) 196 192 4 2.1 Interruptible sales 4,216 4,118 98 2.4 2 3 (1) (33.3 ) Generation plants 70 19 51 Large 1 1 Large Other 945 885 60 6.8 Other gas revenues 13 10 3 30.0 Total 27,352 25,892 1,460 5.6 % $212 $205 $7 3.4 % (a) Revenues from New York gas sales are subject to a weather normalization clause and a revenue decoupling mechanism, as a result of which, delivery revenues are generally not affected by changes in delivery volumes from levels assumed when rates were approved. (b) After adjusting for weather and other variations, total firm sales and transportation volumes increased 1.9 percent in 2014 compared with 2013. Operating revenues increased $7 million in 2014 compared with 2013 due primarily to the increase in gas purchased for resale ($12 million). Gas purchased for resale increased $12 million in 2014 compared with 2013 due to an increase in unit costs ($6 million) and purchased volumes ($6 million). Other operations and maintenance expenses increased $3 million due primarily to an increase in surcharges for assessments and fees that are collected in revenues from customers. Taxes, Other Than Income Taxes Taxes, other than income taxes, decreased $2 million in 2014 compared with 2013. The principal components of taxes, other than income taxes, were: For the Years Ended December 31, (Millions of Dollars) 2014 2013 Variation Property taxes $44 $43 $1 State and local taxes related to revenue receipts 9 12 (3) Payroll taxes 7 7 Total $60 (a) $62 (a) $(2) (a) Including sales tax on customers bills, total taxes other than income taxes in 2014 and 2013 were $86 million and $87 million, respectively. Other Income (Deductions) Other income (deductions) increased $2 million in 2014 compared with 2013 due primarily to higher interest accrued on storm reserves in 2014. Net Interest Expense Net interest expense decreased $2 million in 2014 compared with 2013 reflecting primarily changes to accrued interest resulting from adjustments to prior year federal income tax returns in 2013. Income Tax Expense Income taxes increased $16 million in 2014 compared with 2013 due primarily to higher income before income tax expense ($5 million), higher amortization of New York State Metropolitan Transportation Authority business tax ($3 million) and changes in estimates of accumulated deferred income taxes in 2013 ($6 million). 60 Table of Contents Competitive Energy Businesses The competitive energy businesses results of operations for the year ended December 31, 2014 compared with the year ended December 31, 2013 is as follows: For the Years Ended December 31, (Millions of Dollars) 2014 2013 Variation Operating revenues $1,244 $1,096 $148 Purchased power 1,088 861 227 Gas purchased for resale 115 27 88 Other operations and maintenance 108 105 3 Depreciation and amortization 19 23 (4) Taxes, other than income taxes 19 17 2 (Gain) on sale of solar electric production projects (45) (45) Operating income (loss) $(60) $63 $(123) Operating revenues increased $148 million in 2014 compared with 2013, due primarily to higher wholesale and electric retail revenues ($125 million) and the impact of the LILO transactions ($27 million, see Lease In/Lease Out Transactions in Note J to the financial statements in Item 8). Wholesale revenues increased $80 million in 2014 as compared to 2013 due to higher sales volume. Electric retail revenues increased $45 million due to higher unit prices ($64 million), offset by lower sales volumes ($19 million). Solar revenues decreased $14 million in 2014 as compared with 2013 primarily due to Con Edison Development sale of 50 percent of its membership interest in CED California Holdings Financing I, LLC (California Solar see Note Q to the financial statements in Item 8). Net mark-to-market values decreased $202 million in 2014 as compared with 2013, of which $206 million in losses are reflected in purchased power expenses and $4 million in gains are reflected in revenues. Other revenues increased $6 million in 2014 as compared with 2013, due primarily to higher energy services revenues. Purchased power expenses increased $227 million in 2014 compared with 2013 due primarily to changes in mark-to-market losses ($206 million) and higher unit prices ($64 million), offset by lower volumes ($43 million). Gas purchased for resale increased $88 million due primarily to higher volumes. Other operations and maintenance expenses increased $3 million due primarily to an increase in solar electric production projects in operation during 2014. Depreciation and maintenance expense decreased $4 million due to Con Edison Development sale of 50 percent of its membership interest in California Solar (see Note Q to the financial statements in Item 8). Taxes, other than income taxes increased $2 million due to an increase in sales and use taxes, property taxes and gross receipts tax. Gain on sale of solar electric production projects was $45 million reflecting Con Edison Development sale of 50 percent of its membership interest in California Solar (see Note Q to the financial statements in Item 8). Other Income (Deductions) Other income (deductions) increased $20 million in 2014 compared to 2013 primarily reflecting income from Con Edison Development solar investments that are accounted for under the equity method. Net Interest Expense Net interest expense decreased $143 million in 2014 compared to 2013 due primarily to the impact of the LILO transactions. See Lease In/Lease Out Transactions in Note J to the financial statements in Item 8. Income Tax Expense Income taxes increased $34 million in 2014 compared with 2013 due primarily to higher income before income tax expense ($17 million) and a tax benefit in 2013 resulting from the acceptance by the IRS of the company claim for manufacturing tax deductions ($15 million). Other For Con Edison, Other also includes intercompany eliminations relating to operating revenues and operating expenses. 61 Table of Contents Liquidity and Capital Resources The Companies liquidity reflects cash flows from operating, investing and financing activities, as shown on their respective consolidated statement of cash flows and as discussed below. The principal factors affecting Con Edison liquidity are its investments in the Utilities and the competitive energy businesses, the dividends it pays to its shareholders and the dividends it receives from the Utilities and cash flows from financing activities discussed below. The principal factors affecting CECONY liquidity are its cash flows from operating activities, cash used in investing activities (including construction expenditures), the dividends it pays to Con Edison and cash flows from financing activities discussed below. The Companies generally maintain minimal cash balances and use short-term borrowings to meet their working capital needs and other cash requirements. The Companies repay their short-term borrowings using funds from long-term financings and operating activities. The Utilities cost of capital, including working capital, is reflected in the rates they charge to their customers. Each of the Companies believes that it will be able to meet its reasonably likely short-term and long-term cash requirements. See The Companies Require Access to Capital Markets to Satisfy Funding Requirements and The Companies Also Face Other Risks That Are Beyond Their Control in Item 1A, and Capital Requirements and Resources in Item 1. Changes in the Companies cash and temporary cash investments resulting from operating, investing and financing activities for the years ended December 31, 2015 , 2014 and 2013 are summarized as follows: Con Edison (Millions of Dollars) 2015 2014 Variance 2015 vs. 2014 2013 Variance 2014 vs. 2013 Operating activities $3,277 $2,831 $446 $2,552 $279 Investing activities (3,657) (2,759) (898) (2,659) (100) Financing activities 629 (47) 676 387 (434) Net change for the period 249 25 224 280 (255) Balance at beginning of period 699 674 25 394 280 Balance at end of period 948 699 249 674 25 Less: Held for sale 4 4 Balance at the end of the period excluding held for sale $944 $699 $245 $674 $25 CECONY (Millions of Dollars) 2015 2014 Variance 2015 vs. 2014 2013 Variance 2014 vs. 2013 Operating activities $2,819 $2,430 $389 $2,643 $(213) Investing activities (2,638) (2,304) (334) (2,417) 113 Financing activities 17 (114) 131 54 (168) Net change for the period 198 12 186 280 (268) Balance at beginning of period 645 633 12 353 280 Balance at end of period $843 $645 $198 $633 $12 Cash Flows from Operating Activities The Utilities cash flows from operating activities reflect principally their energy sales and deliveries and cost of operations. The volume of energy sales and deliveries is affected primarily by factors external to the Utilities, such as growth of customer demand, weather, market prices for energy, economic conditions and measures that promote distributed energy resources. Under the revenue decoupling mechanisms in the Utilities New York electric and gas rate plans, changes in delivery volumes from levels assumed when rates were approved may affect the timing of cash flows but generally not net income. See Note B to the financial statements in Item 8. The prices at which the Utilities provide energy to their customers are determined in accordance with their rate plans. In general, changes in the Utilities cost of purchased power, fuel and gas may affect the timing of cash flows but not net income because 62 Table of Contents the costs are recovered in accordance with rate plans. See Recoverable Energy Costs in Note A to the financial statements in Item 8. Net income is the result of cash and non-cash (or accrual) transactions. Only cash transactions affect the Companies cash flows from operating activities. Principal non-cash charges or credits include depreciation, deferred income tax expense and amortizations of certain regulatory assets and liabilities. Non-cash charges or credits may also be accrued under the revenue decoupling and cost reconciliation mechanisms in the Utilities New York electric and gas rate plans. See Rate Plans CECONY Electric and Gas and O&R Electric and Gas in Note B to the financial statements in Item 8. Net cash flows from operating activities in 2015 for Con Edison and CECONY were $446 million and $389 million higher, respectively, than in 2014 . The increase in net cash flows for Con Edison and CECONY reflect primarily lower income taxes paid, net of refunds received in 2015 ( $669 million and $585 million , respectively), offset in part by increased pension contributions ( $172 million and $159 million , respectively) in 2015 . The amount and timing of income tax payments and refunds received reflect, among other things, the extension of bonus depreciation tax provisions. See Note L to the financial statements in Item 8. For information about the Companies' pension contributions, see Note E to the financial statements in Item 8. Net cash flows from operating activities in 2014 for Con Edison and CECONY were $279 million higher and $213 million lower, respectively, than in 2013. The increase in net cash flows for Con Edison reflects primarily the decreased pension contributions ($303 million) in 2014. The decrease in net cash flows for CECONY reflects higher income tax payments ($585 million) in 2014, offset in part by decreased pension contributions ($286 million) in 2014. The change in net cash flows also reflects the timing of payments for and recovery of energy costs. This timing is reflected within changes to accounts receivable customers, recoverable energy costs and accounts payable balances. The changes in regulatory assets principally reflect changes in deferred pension costs in accordance with the accounting rules for retirement benefits. See Notes A, B and E to the financial statements in Item 8. Cash Flows Used in Investing Activities Net cash flows used in investing activities for Con Edison and CECONY were $898 million and $334 million higher, respectively, in 2015 than in 2014 . The changes for Con Edison and CECONY reflect increased utility construction expenditures in 2015 ( $323 million and $316 million , respectively). In addition, the change for Con Edison reflects primarily increased non-utility construction expenditures related to renewable electric production projects ( $312 million ), the proceeds from sale relating to its solar electric production projects in 2014 ( $108 million , see Note Q to the financial statements in Item 8) and increased other investing activities ( $82 million , representing primarily a note receivable related to Panoche Valley, see Note Q to the financial statements in Item 8). Net cash flows used in investing activities for Con Edison and CECONY were $100 million higher and $113 million lower, respectively, in 2014 than in 2013. For Con Edison, the change reflects primarily the proceeds from the termination of the LILO transactions in 2013 ($200 million) and increased investments in renewable electric production projects ($108 million), offset by proceeds from sale relating to its solar electric production projects in 2014 ($108 million, see Note Q to the financial statements in Item 8). In addition, the changes for Con Edison and CECONY reflect decreased utility construction expenditures in 2014. Cash Flows From Financing Activities Net cash flows from financing activities in 2015 for Con Edison and CECONY were $676 million and $131 million higher, respectively, than in 2014 . Net cash flows from financing activities in 2014 for Con Edison and CECONY were $434 million and $168 million lower, respectively, than in 2013 . Net cash flows from financing activities during the years ended December 31, 2015 , 2014 and 2013 reflect the following CECONY transactions: 2015 Issued $650 million of 4.50 percent 30-year debentures, the net proceeds from the sale of which were used to repay short-term borrowings and for other general corporate purposes; and Redeemed at maturity $350 million of 5.375 percent 10-year debentures. 63 Table of Contents 2014 Issued $850 million of 4.45 percent 30-year debentures, $250 million of 3.30 percent 10-year debentures and $750 million of 4.625 percent 40-year debentures, the net proceeds from the sale of which were used to repay short-term borrowings and for other general corporate purposes; Redeemed at maturity $200 million of 4.70 percent 10-year debentures; and Redeemed at maturity $275 million of 5.55 percent 5-year debentures. 2013 Issued $700 million of 3.95 percent 30-year debentures, the net proceeds from the sale of which were used to repay short-term borrowings and for other general corporate purposes; Redeemed at maturity $500 million of 4.875 percent 10-year debentures; and Redeemed at maturity $200 million of 3.85 percent 10-year debentures. Con Edison's net cash flows from financing activities during the year ended December 31, 2015 also reflect the following O&R transactions: 2015 Issued $120 million of 4.95 percent 30-year debentures and $100 million of 4.69 percent 30-year debentures, the net proceeds from the sale of which were used to repay short-term borrowings and for other general corporate purposes; Redeemed at maturity $40 million of 5.30 percent 10-year debentures; Redeemed at maturity $55 million of 2.50 percent 5-year debentures; and Redeemed at maturity $44 million of variable rate tax-exempt 20-year debt. O&R had no issuances of long-term debt in 2014 and 2013. In 2015, a Con Edison Development subsidiary issued $118 million aggregate principal amount of 3.94 percent Senior Notes maturing in 2036 and another subsidiary issued $159 million aggregate principal amount of 4.53 percent Senior Notes maturing in 2040. In 2013, a Con Edison Development subsidiary issued $219 million aggregate principal amount of 4.78 percent senior notes secured by certain of the company California solar electric production projects. The notes have a weighted average life of 15 years and final maturity of 2037. In 2014, the company sold a 50 percent interest in the subsidiary. See Note Q to the financial statements in Item 8. Cash flows from financing activities of the Companies also reflect commercial paper issuance. The commercial paper amounts outstanding at December 31, 2015 , 2014 and 2013 and the average daily balances for 2015 , 2014 and 2013 for Con Edison and CECONY were as follows: 2015 2014 2013 (Millions of Dollars, except Weighted Average Yield) Outstanding at December 31 Daily average Outstanding at December 31 Daily average Outstanding at December 31 Daily average Con Edison $1,529 $823 $801 $899 $1,451 $901 CECONY $1,033 $379 $451 $765 $1,210 $598 Weighted average yield 0.7 % 0.4 % 0.4 % 0.2 % 0.2 % 0.3 % Common stock issuances and external borrowings are sources of liquidity that could be affected by changes in credit ratings, financial performance and capital market conditions.

Capital Requirements and Resources For information about capital requirements, contractual obligations and capital resources, see Capital Requirements and Resources in Item 1. 64 Table of Contents Other Changes in Assets and Liabilities The following table shows changes in certain assets and liabilities at December 31, 2015 , compared with December 31, 2014 . Con Edison CECONY (Millions of Dollars) 2015 vs. 2014 Variance 2015 vs. 2014 Variance Assets Non-utility property, less accumulated depreciation $444 Assets held for sale 157 Regulatory asset Unrecognized pension and other postretirement costs (970) $(912) Liabilities Deferred income taxes and investment tax credits $589 $592 Liabilities held for sale 89 Pension and retiree benefits (1,003) (928) Non-Utility Property, Less Accumulated Depreciation The increase in non-utility property, less accumulated depreciation, for Con Edison reflects the purchase of interests in, and construction expenditures for, renewable electric production projects. See "Competitive Energy Businesses - Con Edison Development" and "Capital Requirements and Resources - Capital Requirements" in Item 1. Assets Held for Sale and Liabilities Held for Sale The increase in assets held for sale and liabilities held for sale reflects Con Edison's plan to sell the retail electric supply business of its competitive energy businesses and O&R's entry into an agreement to sell Pike. See Note U to the financial statements in Item 8. Regulatory Asset for Unrecognized Pension and Other Postretirement Costs and Liability for Pension and Retiree Benefits The decrease in the regulatory asset for unrecognized pension and other postretirement costs and the liability for pension and retiree benefits reflects the amortization of accounting costs during the year. The change in the regulatory assets also reflects the final actuarial valuation of the pension and other retiree benefit plans as measured at December 31, 2015 , in accordance with the accounting rules for retirement benefits. The change in the liability for pension and retiree benefits reflects in part contributions to the plans made by the Utilities in 2015 . See Notes B, E and F to the financial statements in Item 8. Deferred Income Taxes and Investment Tax Credits The increase in the liability for deferred income taxes and investment tax credits reflects primarily accelerated tax deductions for plant, as well as investment tax credits primarily related to Con Edison's renewable electric production projects at its competitive energy businesses. See Note L to the financial statements in Item 8. Off-Balance Sheet Arrangements None of the Companies' interests in variable interest entities (VIEs) meet the SEC definition of off-balance sheet arrangements. For information regarding the Companies VIEs, see Note Q to the financial statements in Item 8. Regulatory Matters For information about the Utilities rate plans and other regulatory matters affecting the Companies, see Utility Regulation in Item 1 and Note B to the financial statements in Item 8. Risk Factors The Companies businesses are influenced by many factors that are difficult to predict, and that involve uncertainties that may materially affect actual operating results, cash flows and financial condition. See Risk Factors in Item 1A. Application of Critical Accounting Policies The Companies financial statements reflect the application of their accounting policies, which conform to accounting principles generally accepted in the United States of America. The Companies critical accounting policies include industry-specific accounting applicable to regulated public utilities and accounting for pensions and other postretirement benefits, contingencies, long-lived assets, goodwill, derivative instruments and leases. Accounting for Regulated Public Utilities The Utilities are subject to the accounting rules for regulated operations and the accounting requirements of the FERC and the state public utility regulatory commissions having jurisdiction. 65 Table of Contents The accounting rules for regulated operations specify the economic effects that result from the causal relationship of costs and revenues in the rate-regulated environment and how these effects are to be accounted for by a regulated enterprise. Revenues intended to cover some costs may be recorded either before or after the costs are incurred. If regulation provides assurance that incurred costs will be recovered in the future, these costs would be recorded as deferred charges or regulatory assets under the accounting rules for regulated operations. If revenues are recorded for costs that are expected to be incurred in the future, these revenues would be recorded as deferred credits or regulatory liabilities under the accounting rules for regulated operations. The Utilities principal regulatory assets and liabilities are listed in Note B to the financial statements in Item 8. The Utilities are each receiving or being credited with a return on all regulatory assets for which a cash outflow has been made. The Utilities are each paying or being charged with a return on all regulatory liabilities for which a cash inflow has been received. The regulatory assets and liabilities will be recovered from customers, or applied for customer benefit, in accordance with rate provisions approved by the applicable public utility regulatory commission. In the event that regulatory assets of the Utilities were no longer probable of recovery, as required by the accounting rules for regulated operations, these regulatory assets would be charged to earnings. At December 31, 2015 , the regulatory assets for Con Edison and CECONY were $8,228 million and $7,603 million , respectively. Accounting for Pensions and Other Postretirement Benefits The Utilities provide pensions and other postretirement benefits to substantially all of their employees and retirees. Con Edison competitive energy businesses also provide such benefits to certain of their employees. The Companies account for these benefits in accordance with the accounting rules for retirement benefits. In addition, the Utilities apply the accounting rules for regulated operations to account for the regulatory treatment of these obligations (which, as described in Note B to the financial statements in Item 8, reconciles the amounts reflected in rates for the costs of the benefit to the costs actually incurred). In applying these accounting policies, the Companies have made critical estimates related to actuarial assumptions, including assumptions of expected returns on plan assets, discount rates, health care cost trends and future compensation. See Notes A, E and F to the financial statements in Item 8 for information about the Companies pension and other postretirement benefits, the actuarial assumptions, actual performance, amortization of investment and other actuarial gains and losses and calculated plan costs for 2015 , 2014 and 2013 . The discount rate for determining the present value of future period benefit payments is determined using a model to match the durations of highly-rated (Aa or higher by either Moody or S&P) corporate bonds with the projected stream of benefit payments. In determining the health care cost trend rate, the Companies review actual recent cost trends and projected future trends. The cost of pension and other postretirement benefits in future periods will depend on actual returns on plan assets, assumptions for future periods, contributions and benefit experience. Con Edison and CECONY current estimates for 2016 are decreases, compared with 2015 , in their pension and other postretirement benefits costs of $266 million and $251 million, respectively. The following table illustrates the effect on 2016 pension and other postretirement costs of changing the critical actuarial assumptions, while holding all other actuarial assumptions constant: 66 Table of Contents Actuarial Assumption Change in Assumption Pension Other Postretirement Benefits Total (Millions of Dollars) Increase in accounting cost: Discount rate Con Edison (0.25 )% $58 $3 $61 CECONY (0.25 )% $54 $2 $56 Expected return on plan assets Con Edison (0.25 )% $29 $2 $31 CECONY (0.25 )% $28 $2 $30 Health care trend rate Con Edison 1.00 % $ $(3) $(3) CECONY 1.00 % $ $(7) $(7) Increase in projected benefit obligation: Discount rate Con Edison (0.25 )% $560 $36 $596 CECONY (0.25 )% $528 $29 $557 Health care trend rate Con Edison 1.00 % $ $(18) $(18) CECONY 1.00 % $ $(37) $(37) A 5.0 percentage point variation in the actual annual return in 2016 , as compared with the expected annual asset return of 7.80 percent, would change pension and other postretirement benefit costs for Con Edison and CECONY by approximately $38 million and $36 million, respectively, in 2017 . Pension benefits are provided through a pension plan maintained by Con Edison to which CECONY, O&R and the competitive energy businesses make contributions for their participating employees. Pension accounting by the Utilities includes an allocation of plan assets. The Companies policy is to fund their pension and other postretirement benefit accounting costs to the extent tax deductible, and for the Utilities, to the extent these costs are recovered under their rate plans. The Companies were not required to make cash contributions to the pension plan in 2015 under funding regulations and tax laws. However, CECONY and O&R made discretionary contributions to the pension plan in 2015 of $697 million and $53 million, respectively. In 2016 , CECONY and O&R expect to make contributions to the pension plan of $469 million and $38 million, respectively. See Expected Contributions in Notes E and F to the financial statements in Item 8. Accounting for Contingencies The accounting rules for contingencies apply to an existing condition, situation or set of circumstances involving uncertainty as to possible loss that will ultimately be resolved when one or more future events occur or fail to occur. Known material contingencies, which are described in the notes to the financial statements, include certain regulatory matters (Note B), the Utilities responsibility for hazardous substances, such as asbestos, PCBs and coal tar that have been used or generated in the course of operations (Note G), and other contingencies (Note H). In accordance with the accounting rules, the Companies have accrued estimates of losses relating to the contingencies as to which loss is probable and can be reasonably estimated and no liability has been accrued for contingencies as to which loss is not probable or cannot be reasonably estimated. The Utilities generally recover costs for asbestos lawsuits, workers compensation and environmental remediation pursuant to their current rate plans. Changes during the terms of the rate plans to the amounts accrued for these contingencies would not impact earnings. 67 Table of Contents Accounting for Long-Lived Assets The accounting rules for property, plant and equipment require that certain long-lived assets must be tested for recoverability whenever events or changes in circumstances indicate their carrying amounts may not be recoverable. The carrying amount of a long-lived asset is deemed not recoverable if it exceeds the sum of the undiscounted cash flows expected to result from the use and eventual disposition of the asset. Under the accounting rules, an impairment loss is recognized if the carrying amount is not recoverable from such cash flows, and exceeds its fair value, which approximates market value. In 2015 , Con Edison recorded a $5 million impairment charge on Pike assets held for sale. See Note U to the financial statements in Item 8. No impairment charges on long-lived assets were recognized in 2014 and 2013 . Accounting for Goodwill In accordance with the accounting rules for goodwill and intangible assets, Con Edison is required to test goodwill for impairment annually. See Note K to the financial statements in Item 8. Goodwill is tested for impairment using a two-step approach. The first step of the goodwill impairment test compares the estimated fair value of a reporting unit with its carrying value, including goodwill. If the estimated fair value of a reporting unit exceeds its carrying value, goodwill of the reporting unit is considered not impaired. If the carrying value exceeds the estimated fair value of the reporting unit, the second step is performed to measure the amount of impairment loss, if any. The second step requires a calculation of the implied fair value of goodwill. Goodwill was $429 million at December 31, 2015 , which consists of $406 million related to the O&R merger and $23 million related to two energy services companies acquired by Con Edison Solutions and a gas storage company acquired by Con Edison Development. The most recent tests, which were performed during 2015, did not require any second-step assessment and did not result in any impairment. Con Edison's most significant assumptions surrounding the goodwill impairment tests relate to the estimates of reporting unit fair values. The company estimated fair values based primarily on discounted cash flows and on market values for a proxy group of companies. Estimates of future cash flows, projected growth rates and discount rates inherent in the cash flow estimates for the energy services companies and gas storage company may vary significantly from actual results, which could result in a future impairment of goodwill. Accounting for Derivative Instruments The Companies apply the accounting rules for derivatives and hedging to their derivative financial instruments. The Companies use derivative financial instruments to hedge market price fluctuations in related underlying transactions for the physical purchase and sale of electricity and gas and interest rate risk on certain debt securities. The Utilities are permitted by their respective regulators to reflect in rates all reasonably incurred gains and losses on these instruments. See Financial and Commodity Market Risks below and Note O to the financial statements in Item 8. Where the Companies are required to make mark-to-market estimates pursuant to the accounting rules, the estimates of gains and losses at a particular period end do not reflect the end results of particular transactions, and will most likely not reflect the actual gain or loss at the conclusion of a transaction. Substantially all of the estimated gains or losses are based on prices supplied by external sources such as the fair value of exchange-traded futures and options and the fair value of positions for which price quotations are available through or derived from brokers or other market sources. Accounting for Leases The Companies apply the accounting rules for leases and other related pronouncements to their leasing transactions. In accordance with the accounting rules, Con Edison accounted for Con Edison Development two Lease In/Lease Out or LILO transactions as leveraged leases. In 2013, a court disallowed tax losses claimed by Con Edison relating to Con Edison Development LILO transactions and the company subsequently terminated the transactions, resulting in charges to earnings of $95 million (after taxes of $63 million) and $1 million in 2013 and 2014, respectively. The transactions had an immaterial impact to earnings in 2015. See Notes J and L to the financial statements in Item 8. Financial and Commodity Market Risks The Companies are subject to various risks and uncertainties associated with financial and commodity markets. The most significant market risks include interest rate risk, commodity price risk, credit risk and investment risk. 68 Table of Contents Interest Rate Risk The Companies' interest rate risk relates primarily to variable rate debt and to new debt financing needed to fund capital requirements, including the construction expenditures of the Utilities and maturing debt securities. Con Edison and its businesses manage interest rate risk through the issuance of mostly fixed-rate debt with varying maturities and through opportunistic refinancing of debt. Con Edison and CECONY estimate that at December 31, 2015 , a 10 percent increase in interest rates applicable to its variable rate debt would result in an increase in annual interest expense of $1 million. Under CECONY current gas, steam and electric rate plans, variations in actual variable rate tax-exempt debt interest expense are reconciled to levels reflected in rates. Commodity Price Risk Con Edison commodity price risk relates primarily to the purchase and sale of electricity, gas and related derivative instruments. The Utilities and Con Edison competitive energy businesses apply risk management strategies to mitigate their related exposures. See Note O to the financial statements in Item 8. Con Edison estimates that, as of December 31, 2015 , a 10 percent decline in market prices would result in a decline in fair value of $91 million for the derivative instruments used by the Utilities to hedge purchases of electricity and gas, of which $82 million is for CECONY and $9 million is for O&R. Con Edison expects that any such change in fair value would be largely offset by directionally opposite changes in the cost of the electricity and gas purchased. In accordance with provisions approved by state regulators, the Utilities generally recover from customers the costs they incur for energy purchased for their customers, including gains and losses on certain derivative instruments used to hedge energy purchased and related costs. See Recoverable Energy Costs in Note A to the financial statements in Item 8. Con Edison competitive energy businesses use a value-at-risk (VaR) model to assess the market price risk of their portfolio of electricity and gas commodity fixed-price purchase and sales commitments, physical forward contracts, generating assets and commodity derivative instruments. VaR represents the potential change in fair value of the portfolio due to changes in market prices, for a specified time period and confidence level. These businesses estimate VaR across their portfolio using a delta-normal variance/covariance model with a 95 percent confidence level. Since the VaR calculation involves complex methodologies and estimates and assumptions that are based on past experience, it is not necessarily indicative of future results. VaR for the portfolio, assuming a one-day holding period, for the years ended December 31, 2015 and 2014 , respectively, was as follows: 95% Confidence Level, One-Day Holding Period 2015 2014 (Millions of Dollars) Average for the period $1 $1 High 2 7 Low The competitive energy businesses compare the measured VaR results against performance due to actual prices and stress test the portfolio each quarter using an assumed 30 percent price change from forecast. The stress test includes an assessment of the impact of volume changes on the portfolio because the businesses generally commit to sell their customers their actual requirements, an amount which is estimated when the sales commitments are made. The businesses limit the volume of commodity derivative instruments entered into relative to their estimated sale commitments to maintain net market price exposures to their estimated sale commitments within a certain percentage of maximum and minimum exposures. Credit Risk The Companies are exposed to credit risk related to transactions entered into primarily for the various energy supply and hedging activities by the Utilities and the competitive energy businesses. See Credit Exposure in Note O to the financial statements in Item 8. 69 Table of Contents Investment Risk The Companies investment risk relates to the investment of plan assets for their pension and other postretirement benefit plans. See Application of Critical Accounting Policies Accounting for Pensions and Other Postretirement Benefits, above and Notes E and F to the financial statements in Item 8. The Companies current investment policy for pension plan assets includes investment targets of 55 to 65 percent equities and 35 to 45 percent fixed income and other securities. At December 31, 2015 , the pension plan investments consisted of 57 percent equity and 43 percent fixed income and other securities. Environmental Matters For information concerning climate change, environmental sustainability, potential liabilities arising from laws and regulations protecting the environment and other environmental matters, see Environmental Matters in Item 1 and Note G to the financial statements in Item 8. Impact of Inflation The Companies are affected by the decline in the purchasing power of the dollar caused by inflation. Regulation permits the Utilities to recover through depreciation only the historical cost of their plant assets even though in an inflationary economy the cost to replace the assets upon their retirement will substantially exceed historical costs. The impact is, however, partially offset by the repayment of the Companies long-term debt in dollars of lesser value than the dollars originally borrowed. Material Contingencies For information concerning potential liabilities arising from the Companies material contingencies, see Application of Critical Accounting Policies Accounting for Contingencies, above, and Notes B, G and H to the financial statements in Item 8.
