Item 7. Management Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations Overview Management discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations is provided as a supplement to our consolidated financial statements and accompanying footnotes to help provide an understanding of our financial condition, the changes in our financial condition and our results of operations. Our discussion is organized as follows: Recent developments . This section provides a general description of recent events that are important to understanding our results of operations and financial condition. Critical accounting policies . This section contains a discussion of the accounting policies that we believe are important to our financial condition and results of operations and that require significant judgment and estimates on the part of management in their application. In addition, all of our significant accounting policies, including critical accounting policies, are summarized in Note 1 to the accompanying consolidated financial statements. Recent accounting pronouncements . This section provides a discussion of recent accounting pronouncements that we believe are important to understanding our results of operations and financial condition. Non-GAAP financial measure . This section provides a discussion of internal revenue growth, a non-GAAP financial measure that we use in this report. Results of operations . This section contains an analysis of our results of operations by comparing the results for the year ended December 31, 2007 to the results for the year ended December 31, 2006, and comparing the results for the year ended December 31, 2006 to the results for the year ended December 31, 2005. 22 Table of Contents Liquidity and capital resources . This section provides an analysis of our cash flows and a discussion of our outstanding debt and commitments as of December 31, 2007. Recent Developments In December 2007, we acquired CheckFree, a leader in electronic commerce services and products, including electronic bill payment and Internet banking, for approximately $4.4 billion in cash and sold CredStar, a mortgage credit reporting unit. In the first quarter of 2008, we sold Fiserv Health to UnitedHealthcare Services, Inc. for $721 million in cash, which amount includes initial adjustments for net working capital and certain indebtedness of Fiserv Health and its subsidiaries as of the closing, and we sold the majority of our Fiserv Investment Support Services business to TD Ameritrade Online Holdings, Inc. for $225 million in cash at closing, plus the amount of acquired regulatory capital. We also sold Del Mar Database, a provider of loan broker management products, in the first quarter of 2008. The operations of Fiserv Health, Fiserv ISS and the two lending businesses are reported as discontinued operations for all periods presented. In connection with the sale of the portion of the Fiserv ISS business to TD Ameritrade Online Holdings, Inc., we can earn contingent cash consideration of up to $100 million based on the achievement of revenue targets over the twelve months subsequent to closing. With respect to the second part of the Fiserv ISS transaction, Robert Beriault Holdings, Inc. has agreed to acquire the remaining accounts and net capital of Fiserv ISS, including the investment administration services business which provides back office and custody services for individual retirement accounts, for approximately $50 million in cash. We will retain a minority interest in this business; however, our continuing involvement is not expected to be significant. This portion of the Fiserv ISS disposition is expected to close by the end of the second quarter of 2008, and is subject to regulatory approval and customary closing conditions. Our operations are classified into three business segments: our financial institution services business segment; our insurance services business segment; and our CheckFree business segment. Due to the planned disposition of Fiserv ISS, our previously reported investment support services business segment is included in our results of discontinued operations. In the first quarter of 2008, we expect that we will realign our business segments when our new reporting structure and CheckFree integration plans are finalized. Critical Accounting Policies General Our consolidated financial statements and accompanying notes have been prepared in accordance with accounting principles generally accepted in the United States of America. The preparation of these financial statements requires our management to make estimates, judgments and assumptions that affect the reported amount of assets, liabilities, revenues and expenses. We continually evaluate the accounting policies and estimates that we use to prepare the consolidated financial statements. We base our estimates on historical experience and assumptions that we believe are reasonable in light of current circumstances. Actual amounts and results could differ materially from these estimates. Revenue Recognition The majority of our revenues are generated from monthly account and transaction-based fees. Revenue is recognized when the related services have been rendered. Revenues are primarily recognized under service agreements that are long-term in nature, generally three to five years, and that do not require management to make significant judgments or assumptions. Given the nature of our business and the rules governing revenue recognition, our revenue recognition practices do not involve significant estimates that materially affect our results of operations. Additional information about our revenue recognition policies is included in Note 1 to the consolidated financial statements. 23 Table of Contents Valuation of Goodwill and Acquired Intangible Assets We are required to allocate the purchase price of acquired businesses to the assets acquired and liabilities assumed in the transaction at their estimated fair values. The estimates used to determine the fair value of long-lived assets, such as intangible assets, can be complex and require a significant amount of judgment. We use the information available to us to make fair value determinations and engage independent valuation specialists, when necessary, to assist in the fair value determination of significant acquired long-lived assets. We are also required to estimate the useful lives of intangible assets to determine the amount of acquisition-related intangible asset amortization expense to record in future periods. We periodically review the estimated useful lives assigned to our definite-lived intangible assets to determine whether such estimated useful lives continue to be appropriate. We review the carrying value of goodwill and indefinite-lived intangible assets for impairment annually and whenever events or changes in circumstances indicate the carrying value may not be recoverable in accordance with Statement of Financial Accounting Standard ( SFAS ) No. 142, Goodwill and Other Intangible Assets ( SFAS 142 ). SFAS 142 requires us to perform a two-step impairment test on goodwill. First, we compare the fair value of each reporting unit to its carrying value. We determine the fair value of our reporting units based on the present value of estimated future cash flows. If the fair value of a reporting unit exceeds the carrying value of the unit net assets, goodwill is not impaired and further testing is not required. If the carrying value of the reporting unit net assets exceeds the fair value of the unit, then we perform the second step of the impairment test to determine the implied fair value of the reporting unit goodwill and any impairment charge. Additionally, we estimate the fair value of acquired intangible assets with indefinite lives and compare this amount to the underlying carrying value. Determining the fair value of a reporting unit or acquired intangible assets with indefinite lives involves judgment and the use of significant estimates and assumptions, which include assumptions regarding the revenue growth rates and operating margins used to calculate estimated future cash flows, risk-adjusted discount rates and future economic and market conditions. Our most recent impairment assessment in the fourth quarter of 2007 determined that the carrying values of goodwill and indefinite-lived intangible assets are not impaired. Given the significance of our goodwill and intangible asset balances, an adverse change in fair value could result in an impairment charge, which could be material to our financial statements. Other We do not participate in, nor have we created, any off-balance sheet variable interest entities or other off-balance sheet financing, other than operating leases. In addition, we do not enter into any derivative financial instruments for speculative purposes and use derivative financial instruments for managing our exposure to changes in interest rates and managing our ratio of fixed to floating-rate long-term debt. Recent Accounting Pronouncements See Note 1 to our consolidated financial statements for a full description of recent accounting pronouncements, including the anticipated adoption dates, which is incorporated herein by reference. Non-GAAP Financial Measure In this report, we refer to internal revenue growth percentage, which is a non-GAAP financial measure. We use internal revenue growth percentage to monitor and evaluate our performance, and it is presented in this report because we believe that it allows investors to see the portion of our revenue growth that is attributed to acquired companies as compared to internal revenue growth. This non-GAAP financial measure should not be considered to be a substitute for our reported results prepared in accordance with GAAP. The method that we use to calculate internal revenue growth percentage is not necessarily comparable to similarly titled measures presented by other companies. 24 Table of Contents Internal revenue growth percentage is measured as the increase or decrease in total revenue for the current year less acquired revenue from acquisitions divided by total revenues from the prior year plus acquired revenue from acquisitions. Acquired revenue from acquisitions represents pre-acquisition revenue of acquired companies, less dispositions, for the prior year. Acquired revenue from acquisitions was $147 million ($44 million in the Financial segment and $103 million in the Insurance segment) and $99 million ($66 million in the Financial segment and $33 million in the Insurance segment) in 2007 and 2006, respectively. Internal revenue growth percentages exclude our recent acquisition of CheckFree because only a partial month of CheckFree revenue was recorded in December 2007. Results of Operations Components of Revenues and Expenses The following summary describes the components of revenues and expenses as presented in our consolidated statements of income. A description of our revenue recognition policies is included in Note 1 to the consolidated financial statements. Processing and Services Processing and services revenues, which in 2007 represented approximately 70% of our consolidated revenues, are primarily generated from account and transaction-based fees under contracts that generally have terms of three to five years. Revenue is recognized when the related transactions are processed and services have been rendered. Processing and services revenues are most reflective of our core business performance because a significant amount of our total operating profit is generated by these services. Cost of processing and services includes costs directly associated with providing services to clients and includes the following: personnel; equipment and data communication; infrastructure costs, including costs to maintain applications; customer support; depreciation and amortization; and other operating expenses. Product Product revenues, which in 2007 represented approximately 30% of our consolidated revenues, are primarily derived from prescription product (approximately 10%), software license (approximately 5%), and integrated print, electronic communications and other (approximately 15%). Product revenues in our Insurance segment include workers compensation prescription product costs for which we are the principal under the indicators set forth in Emerging Issues Task Force ( EITF ) No. 99-19, Reporting Revenue Gross as a Principal versus Net as an Agent. Prescription product revenues are recognized on a gross basis to include the prescription price based on established fee schedules or usual and customary rates. Prescription product costs included in both product revenues and cost of product were $449 million, $367 million and $295 million in 2007, 2006 and 2005, respectively. Cost of product, in addition to prescription product costs, includes the following: personnel; infrastructure costs; depreciation and amortization; and other costs directly associated with product revenue. We also include customer reimbursements, such as postage and telecommunication costs, in processing and services revenue, product revenue, cost of processing and services, and cost of product in accordance with EITF 01-14, Income Statement Characterization of Reimbursements Received for Out-of-Pocket Expenses Incurred. These costs, which are pass-through expenses to clients and which are included in both revenues and expenses, were $432 million, $409 million and $345 million in 2007, 2006 and 2005, respectively. Selling, General and Administrative Expenses Selling, general and administrative expenses primarily consist of: salaries, wages and related expenses paid to sales personnel, administrative employees and management; advertising and promotional costs; depreciation and amortization; and other selling and administrative expenses. 25 Table of Contents Results of Operations The following table presents certain amounts included in our consolidated statements of income, the relative percentage that those amounts represent to revenues and the percentage change in those amounts from year to year. This information should be read along with the consolidated financial statements and accompanying notes.

(2) Each percentage of revenue equals the relevant expense or operating income amount divided by total revenues. Total Revenues Total revenues increased $356 million, or 10%, in 2007 compared to 2006, and $325 million, or 10%, in 2006 compared to 2005. The internal revenue growth rate was 3% in 2007 and 7% in 2006 with the remaining growth resulting from acquisitions. Overall internal revenue growth is primarily derived from sales to new clients, cross-sales to existing clients and increases in transaction volumes from existing clients. The higher internal revenue growth rate in 2006 compared to 2007 was primarily due to an increase in pass-through prescription revenue from new clients and increased volumes in our Insurance segment workers compensation businesses which had a positive impact of approximately two percentage points in 2006. Processing and services revenues increased 8% and 6% in 2007 and 2006, respectively, compared to the prior year periods. These increases were driven by sales to new clients, cross-sales to existing clients, increases in transaction volumes from existing clients and incremental revenue attributable to several acquisitions, including a partial month of processing and services revenues totaling $84 million from the acquisition of CheckFree on December 3, 2007. Partially offsetting these increases in 2007 were a $33 million decrease in flood claims processing revenues in our Insurance segment and revenue decreases in our lending processing businesses due to lower processing volumes primarily resulting from a downturn in the mortgage markets in the United States. Partially offsetting the increases in 2006 were a $35 million decrease in contract termination fees and the impact of the loss of two clients in 2005. Contract termination fees were $35 million, $23 million and $58 million in 2007, 2006 and 2005, respectively. Businesses in our Financial segment generally enter into three to five year contracts with clients that contain early contract termination fees. These fees can be generated when an existing client is acquired by another financial institution and can vary significantly from period to period based on the number and size of clients that are acquired and how early in the contract term a client is acquired. 26 Table of Contents Product revenues increased 14% and 21% in 2007 and 2006, respectively, compared to the prior year periods. These increases were primarily due to incremental revenue attributable to new clients and increased volumes in the Insurance segment workers compensation businesses, growth in card fulfillment and print services within our output solutions division, and an acquisition in 2007. The revenue growth in our workers compensation businesses was impacted significantly by the inclusion of prescription product costs in revenues and expenses of $449 million, $367 million and $295 million in 2007, 2006 and 2005, respectively. Total Expenses Total expenses increased $291 million, or 10%, in 2007 compared to 2006 and $322 million, or 12%, in 2006 compared to 2005. These increases were primarily driven by the significant increase in prescription product costs. Cost of processing and services as a percentage of processing and services revenues declined to 61.6% in 2007 as compared to 63.4% and 63.1% in 2006 and 2005, respectively. The decrease in 2007 was primarily due to operating efficiencies in the Financial segment resulting from the implementation of strategic initiatives that lowered costs and the positive impact of higher-margin transaction and payment related revenues, partially offset by a decrease in higher-margin flood claims processing revenues. Cost of product as a percentage of product revenue was 79.7% in 2007, 77.8% in 2006 and 77.1% in 2005. The increases in cost of product were primarily driven by the significant increase in prescription product costs in 2007 and 2006 as discussed above. Selling, general and administrative expenses as a percentage of revenues increased to 14.2% in 2007 from 13.6% and 12.6% in 2006 and 2005, respectively. Selling, general and administrative expenses in 2007 were negatively impacted by the following: charges totaling $12 million primarily related to employee severance and facility shutdown expenses in our lending businesses to reduce our cost structure due in part to the significant downturn in the mortgage markets in the United States in the second half of 2007; merger and integration costs of $8 million related to our acquisition of CheckFree, including integration project management, employee severance and retention bonuses; a charge of $8 million associated with the amendment of an employment agreement related to the creation of our wholly-owned offshore captive operation; and amortization expense of $6 million related to intangible assets acquired in the CheckFree acquisition. Selling, general and administrative expenses in 2007 and 2006 included $13 million and $16 million, respectively, of incremental share-based compensation expense as a result of the prospective adoption of SFAS 123R on January 1, 2006. In addition, 2006 included charges of $9 million related to the write-down of assets and facility shutdown costs in our lending businesses. Operating Income and Operating Margin Operating income increased $65 million, or 10%, in 2007 compared to 2006 and operating margins were 18.6% in 2007 and 2006, compared to 20.4% in 2005. Our operating margin in 2007 compared to 2006 was positively impacted by strong performance in our Financial segment offset by our Insurance segment performance and several charges as explained below. In 2007, operating income and margins were positively impacted by increases in higher-margin revenues in our electronic payments businesses, continued strong operating results in our bank and credit union core processing businesses and improvements in overall operating efficiencies. In addition, CheckFree contributed operating income of $14 million in the month of December. These positive factors were partially offset by a $33 million decrease in higher-margin flood claims processing revenues in our Insurance segment, charges totaling $12 million primarily related to employee severance and facility shutdown expenses in our lending businesses, merger and integration costs of $8 million related to our acquisition of CheckFree, and a charge of $8 million associated with the amendment of an employment agreement related to the creation of our wholly-owned offshore captive operation. 27 Table of Contents Operating income and margin in 2006 as compared to 2005 was positively impacted by strong Financial and Insurance segment results and was negatively impacted by a $35 million decrease in higher-margin contract termination fees, a $22 million increase in share-based compensation expense related to the prospective adoption of SFAS 123R on January 1, 2006, operating losses associated with our Australian check processing operations and charges of $9 million related to the write-down of assets and facility shutdown costs in our lending businesses. In addition, operating margins in both 2007 and 2006 were negatively impacted by revenue growth in our workers compensation businesses, which generate operating margins in the low- to mid-single digits. The negative impact on operating margins due to the inclusion of prescription product costs in revenue and expense was approximately two percentage points in 2007, 2006 and 2005. Segment Results Our continuing operations are classified into three business segments: our financial institution services business segment (our Financial segment); our insurance services business segment (our Insurance segment); and our CheckFree business segment (our CheckFree segment). The businesses that make up our Financial segment provide account and transaction processing systems and services to financial institutions, such as banks, thrifts and credit unions, and other financial intermediaries. The businesses that comprise our Insurance segment provide a wide range of services to insurance carriers, agents and distributors. The businesses that comprise our CheckFree segment provide online banking, electronic billing and payment, software applications and investment management solutions to financial institutions and financial services organizations. CheckFree is presented as a separate segment because it was acquired on December 3, 2007. In the first quarter of 2008, we expect that we will realign our business segments when our new reporting structure and CheckFree integration plans are finalized. The following table presents, for the years indicated, revenues, operating income, and operating margin for our business segments. Years ended December 31, (Dollars in millions) Financial Insurance CheckFree (3) Total Total revenues: 2007 $ 3,006 $ 829 $ 87 $ 3,922 2006 2,838 728 3,566 2005 2,611 630 3,241 Revenue growth (1) : 2007 6 % 14 % 10 % 2006 9 % 16 % 10 % Operating income: 2007 (2) $ 667 $ 63 $ 14 $ 744 2006 566 99 665 2005 578 84 662 Operating income growth (decline) (1) : 2007 (2) 18 % (36 )% 12 % 2006 (2 )% 18 % 0 % Operating margin: 2007 (2) 22.2 % 7.5 % 16.7 % 19.0 % 2006 19.9 % 13.6 % 18.6 % 2005 22.1 % 13.3 % 20.4 % (1) Represents revenue or operating income growth (decline) compared to the prior year. (2) Operating income and margin excludes merger and integration costs associated with acquisitions and a charge associated with the amendment of an employment agreement related to the creation of an offshore captive totaling $14 million which are not allocated to the segments. See Note 8 to our consolidated financial statements for a reconciliation of segment operating income to operating income reported on the consolidated statement of income. (3) We acquired CheckFree on December 3, 2007 and, as a result, the 2007 results include 28 days of CheckFree operations and amortization expense from acquired intangible assets of $9 million. 28 Table of Contents Financial Revenues in our Financial segment increased $168 million, or 6%, in 2007 and $227 million, or 9%, in 2006. The internal revenue growth rate in the Financial segment was 4% and 6% in 2007 and 2006, respectively, with the remaining growth in each year resulting from acquisitions. Internal revenue growth in this segment was primarily driven by increased volumes and new clients in the electronic payments businesses along with new client growth and increased sales to existing clients in the banking and credit union core processing businesses and card fulfillment businesses. In 2007, internal revenue growth was negatively impacted by approximately one percentage point due to a decrease in revenues in our home equity loan processing businesses due primarily to a decline in volumes associated with weakness in the mortgage markets in the United States in the second half of 2007. In 2006, internal revenue growth was negatively impacted by approximately one percentage point from a decrease in contract termination fees. Operating income in our Financial segment increased $101 million, or 18%, in 2007 compared to 2006 and decreased $12 million, or 2%, in 2006 compared to 2005. Operating margins were 22.2%, 19.9% and 22.1% in 2007, 2006 and 2005, respectively. Operating margins in 2007 increased 2.3 percentage points compared to 2006 primarily due to higher-margin revenue growth in our core processing and electronic payments businesses and overall operating efficiencies in our bank and credit union core processing and payments businesses resulting primarily from the implementation of strategic initiatives that lowered costs. Operating margins in 2006 decreased 2.2 percentage points compared to 2005 and were negatively impacted by a $35 million decrease in higher-margin contract termination fees, an increase of $21 million in share-based compensation expense related to the prospective adoption of SFAS 123R on January 1, 2006, charges totaling $9 million related to the write-down of assets and facility shutdown costs in our lending businesses and operating losses associated with our Australia check processing operations. Insurance Revenues in our Insurance segment increased $101 million, or 14%, in 2007 compared to 2006 and $98 million, or 16%, in 2006 compared to 2005. The internal revenue growth rate in this segment was 0% in 2007 and 10% in 2006. The 2007 internal revenue growth rate decreased from 2006 primarily due to a $33 million decrease in flood claims processing revenues and lower pass-through prescription revenue growth in our workers compensation businesses. Operating income in our Insurance segment decreased $36 million, or 36%, in 2007 compared to 2006 and increased $15 million, or 18%, in 2006 compared to 2005. Operating margins were 7.5% in 2007 compared to 13.6% in 2006 and 13.3% in 2005. Operating margins declined in 2007 compared to 2006 due primarily to a $33 million decrease in higher-margin flood claims processing revenues and charges totaling $4 million related to facility shutdown and employee severance related to the consolidation of operations. Operating margins in our Insurance segment are impacted by the significant increase in revenues in our workers compensation businesses, which generate operating margins in the low- to mid-single digits. The inclusion of prescription product costs in revenue and expense negatively impacted operating margins in the Insurance segment by nine percentage points, 14 percentage points and 12 percentage points in 2007, 2006 and 2005, respectively. CheckFree We acquired CheckFree on December 3, 2007 and, as a result, our 2007 operating results include 28 days of CheckFree operations. During this period, revenues totaled $87 million and operating income and operating margin were $14 million and 16.7%, respectively. Included in total expenses for the CheckFree segment was amortization expense from acquired intangible assets totaling $9 million during the 28 day period. 29 Table of Contents Interest Expense and Interest Income Interest expense was $76 million, $41 million and $28 million in 2007, 2006 and 2005, respectively. The $35 million increase in interest expense in 2007 was primarily due to the new senior term loan and senior notes borrowings in the fourth quarter of 2007 to finance our acquisition of CheckFree. Because of these new borrowings, which had a combined principal balance of $4.25 billion at December 31, 2007, we expect that interest expense will be significantly higher in 2008 as compared to 2007. The $13 million increase in interest expense in 2006 was due primarily to higher interest rates and increased average borrowings outstanding in 2006 compared to 2005. Interest income was $7 million, $0 and $7 million in 2007, 2006 and 2005, respectively. Interest income in 2007 was earned by investing the proceeds from the senior notes borrowings during the period from our receipt of the proceeds until we completed the CheckFree acquisition. The interest income in 2005 was primarily due to increased cash balances resulting from the proceeds we received for the sale of our securities clearing businesses. Realized Gain from Sale of Investments In 2005, we realized a pre-tax gain of $44 million from the sale of 3.2 million shares of common stock of Bisys Group, Inc. In addition, we sold our investment in INTRIA Items, Inc. to our joint venture partner, Canadian Imperial Bank of Commerce, which resulted in a pre-tax gain of $43 million. Income Tax Provision Our effective income tax rate for continuing operations was 38.3% in 2007, 37.8% in 2006 and 37.6% in 2005. The effective income tax rates for 2006 and 2005 were favorably impacted, as compared to 2007, primarily by changes in state tax laws, the finalization of various tax returns and a lower tax rate on the sale of investments. We expect that our income tax rate for continuing operations will be approximately 38.5% in 2008. Income from Discontinued Operations Income from discontinued operations, which includes Fiserv Health, Fiserv ISS, CredStar, Del Mar Database and our securities clearing businesses, totaled $31 million in 2007 and $62 million in 2006 and 2005. The decrease in income from discontinued operations in 2007 was primarily due to $18 million of charges related to disposition activities including retention bonuses, employee severance and other sale related expenses and a $14 million charge at Fiserv Health for employee severance, facility shutdown and other charges to cease an investment in a new technology platform in the health plan management business in the second quarter of 2007. Net Income Per Share-Diluted Net income per share-diluted for 2007 was $2.60 compared to $2.53 in 2006 and $2.70 in 2005. Net income per share-diluted from continuing operations was $2.42 in 2007 compared to $2.19 in 2006 and $2.38 in 2005. Net income per share-diluted from continuing operations in 2007 compared to 2006 was negatively impacted by approximately $0.07 per share due to merger and integration costs and intangible amortization expense associated with our acquisition of CheckFree and a $0.01 per share increase in facility shutdown and related costs. Net income per share-diluted from continuing operations in 2006 compared to 2005 was negatively impacted by a decrease of $0.29 per share from realized gains on sale of investments in 2005, approximately $0.12 per share from a decrease in contract termination fees in 2006, $0.08 per share of incremental share-based compensation expense in 2006 due to the prospective adoption of FAS 123R on January 1, 2006, and $0.03 per share related to the write-down of assets and facility shutdown costs in 2006. Amortization expense related to acquired intangible assets totaled $0.15 per share, $0.09 per share and $0.07 per share in 2007, 2006 and 2005, respectively. 30 Table of Contents Liquidity and Capital Resources Our principal liquidity needs are: (i) to fund normal operating expenses; (ii) to meet debt service requirements of $500 million in 2008, including $250 million of our senior notes maturing in April and June of 2008 and $250 million of our senior term loan due in December of 2008; and (iii) to fund capital expenditures and operating lease payments. We believe these needs will be satisfied using cash flows generated by operations and proceeds from dispositions during the next twelve months. In the first quarter of 2008, we received proceeds from the dispositions of Fiserv Health and Fiserv ISS totaling approximately $660 million after taxes. As of January 31, 2008, we had $637 million available for borrowing under our revolving credit facility. Net cash provided by operating activities from continuing operations, or operating cash flow, was $564 million in 2007 compared with $542 million in 2006. Operating cash flow in 2007 compared to 2006 was negatively impacted by the payment of $30 million to settle treasury-lock interest rate hedge contracts entered into in connection with the financing of our acquisition of CheckFree. Our capital expenditures, including capitalization of software costs, were $160 million, or 4.1% of total revenues, $163 million, or 4.6% of total revenues, and $141 million, or 4.4% of total revenues, in 2007, 2006 and 2005, respectively. We purchased treasury stock totaling $469 million, $560 million and $653 million in 2007, 2006 and 2005, respectively. As of December 31, 2007, we were authorized by our board of directors to purchase up to 1.8 million additional shares of our common stock. Share repurchases under this authorization are expected to be made through open market transactions as market conditions warrant. Shares repurchased are generally held for issuance in connection with our equity plans. Our current policy is to use our operating cash flow primarily to fund capital expenditures and to repay debt, rather than to pay dividends. On December 3, 2007, we acquired CheckFree for $4.2 billion, net of cash acquired. To complete the acquisition, we borrowed $2.5 billion under an unsecured senior term loan facility with a syndicate of banks, issued $1.75 billion of senior notes and borrowed under our revolving credit facility. In 2007, 2006 and 2005, we used $127 million, $187 million and $510 million, respectively, to acquire other businesses. Revolving Credit Facility and Commercial Paper We maintain a $900 million unsecured revolving credit facility with a syndicate of banks. The facility bears interest at a variable rate based on LIBOR plus a specified margin or the bank base rate. There are no significant commitment fees or compensating balance requirements under this facility. The revolving credit facility, as amended, contains various restrictions and covenants that require us, among other things, to limit our consolidated indebtedness to no more than a specified multiple (ranging between 3.5 and 4.5) of consolidated net earnings before interest, taxes, depreciation and amortization and certain other adjustments and to maintain consolidated net earnings before interest, taxes, depreciation and amortization and certain other adjustments of at least three times consolidated interest expense. The facility expires on March 24, 2011. In 2007, we were in compliance with all debt covenants in this and our other credit facilities, including those contained in our senior unsecured notes. We are authorized to issue up to $500 million of unsecured commercial paper under our commercial paper program. Under this program, we may issue commercial paper with maturities of up to 397 days from the date of issuance. The revolving credit facility supports 100% of any outstanding commercial paper. As a result, borrowings under the commercial paper program reduce the amount of credit available under the revolving credit facility. As of December 31, 2007, no commercial paper borrowings were outstanding under this program. Borrowings under the revolving credit facility and commercial paper program were $840 million and $452 million at December 31, 2007 and 2006, respectively. The weighted-average variable interest rate on these borrowings was 5.4% at December 31, 2007. 31 Table of Contents Senior Term Loan In December 2007, we borrowed $2.5 billion under an unsecured senior term loan facility with a syndicate of banks. This term loan bears interest at a variable rate based on LIBOR plus a specified margin or the bank base rate, and matures in December 2012. Scheduled principal payments of $250 million are due in December 2008 and 2009, payments of $375 million are due in December 2010 and 2011, and the remaining principal of $1.25 billion is due in December 2012. The weighted-average variable interest rate on the term loan borrowings was 5.5% at December 31, 2007. The term loan facility contains various restrictions and covenants substantially similar to those contained in the revolving credit facility described above. Senior Notes In November 2007, we issued $1.25 billion of 6.125% senior notes due in November 2012 and $500 million of 6.8% senior notes due in November 2017, which notes pay interest at the stated rate on May 20 and November 20 of each year. In addition, we previously issued $150 million of 4% senior notes, which are due in April 2008, and $100 million of 3% senior notes, which are due in June 2008. Interest Rate Hedge Contracts To manage exposure to fluctuations in interest rates, we entered into a series of treasury lock agreements ( Treasury Locks ) in 2007 with total notional values of $0.9 billion and maintain interest rate swap agreements ( Swaps ) with total notional values of $1.9 billion and $150 million at December 31, 2007 and 2006, respectively. The Swaps effectively fix interest rates on floating rate borrowings under the revolving credit facility and term loan at a weighted-average rate of approximately 4.5%, prior to financing spreads and related fees. The Swaps have original contract terms of two to five years with expiration dates through September 2012. Upon the issuance of the senior notes in November 2007, we paid $30 million to settle the Treasury Locks. This payment was recorded in accumulated other comprehensive loss, net of income taxes of $11 million, and will be recognized as interest expense over the terms of the senior notes. In addition, we maintain fixed-to-floating interest rate swap agreements on the $150 million 4% senior notes, with a variable interest rate of 6.0% at December 31, 2007. 364-Day Revolving Credit Facility In November 2007, we entered into a 364-day revolving credit facility under which borrowings were conditioned upon our full draw of available borrowings under our $900 million revolving credit facility described above and prepayments were required in the event of certain asset sales or other transactions. No borrowings under the 364-day revolving credit facility were outstanding at December 31, 2007 and we terminated this facility in February 2008. Shelf Registration Statement In 2007, we filed a shelf registration statement with the Securities and Exchange Commission. Under the registration statement, we may sell common stock, preferred stock and debt securities, or a combination thereof. Each time we sell securities pursuant to the shelf registration statement, we will provide a prospectus supplement that will contain specific information about the terms of the securities being offered and of the offering. We may offer and sell the securities pursuant to this prospectus from time to time in one or more of the following ways: through underwriters or dealers, through agents, directly to purchasers or through a combination of any of these methods. Proceeds from the sale of these securities may be used to repay indebtedness or for working capital, acquisitions or general corporate purposes. As discussed above, in 2007, we issued $1.75 billion of senior unsecured notes under the shelf registration statement. 32 Table of Contents Other Access to capital markets impacts our cost of capital, our ability to refinance maturing indebtedness and our ability to fund future acquisitions. Our ability to access capital on favorable terms depends on various factors, including general market conditions, interest rates, credit ratings on our debt securities, perception of our potential future earnings and the market price of our capital stock. As of December 31, 2007, we had a credit rating of Baa2 with a stable outlook from Moody Investors Service, Inc. ( Moody ) and BBB with a negative outlook from Standard & Poor Ratings Services ( S&P ) on our senior unsecured debt securities. The interest rate payable on our senior notes is subject to adjustment from time to time if Moody or S&P downgrades (or subsequently upgrades) the debt rating applicable to the senior notes. If the ratings from Moody or S&P decrease, the per annum interest rate on the notes is subject to increase by up to 2.0%. In no event will the per annum interest rate be reduced below the original interest rate applicable to the senior notes or will the total increase in the per annum interest rate be more than 2.0% above the original interest rate. The interest rates on any series of senior notes will permanently cease to be subject to any adjustment if the notes become rated A3 (or its equivalent) or higher by Moody and A- (or its equivalent) or higher by S&P, in each case with a stable or positive outlook. Off-Balance Sheet Arrangements and Contractual Obligations We do not have any material off-balance sheet arrangements. The interest component of long-term debt obligations and minimum operating lease payments are reported on a pre-tax basis. The following table details our contractual cash obligations at December 31, 2007: (In millions) Total Less than 1 year 1-3 years 3-5 years More than 5 years Long-term debt including interest $ 6,744 $ 751 $ 1,043 $ 4,068 $ 882 Minimum operating lease payments 424 114 164 85 61 Purchase obligations 28 22 5 1 Income tax obligations 60 9 27 21 3 Total $ 7,256 $ 896 $ 1,239 $ 4,175 $ 946 33 Table of Contents QUARTERLY FINANCIAL INFORMATION (Unaudited) (In millions, except per share data) Quarters First Second Third Fourth Total 2007 Revenues: Processing and services $ 646 $ 655 $ 652 $ 740 $ 2,693 Product 298 284 277 370 1,229 Total revenues 944 939 929 1,110 3,922 Expenses: Cost of processing and services 403 399 393 463 1,658 Cost of product 236 225 223 295 979 Selling, general and administrative 128 133 123 171 555 Total expenses 767 757 739 929 3,192 Operating income 177 182 190 181 730 Interest expense, net (9 ) (11 ) (13 ) (36 ) (69 ) Income from continuing operations before income taxes 168 171 177 145 661 Income tax provision 65 66 67 55 253 Income from continuing operations 103 105 110 90 408 Income from discontinued operations, net of income taxes 11 3 11 6 31 Net income $ 114 $ 108 $ 121 $ 96 $ 439 Net income per share basic: Continuing operations $ 0.60 $ 0.63 $ 0.67 $ 0.55 $ 2.45 Discontinued operations 0.07 0.02 0.06 0.04 0.19 Total $ 0.67 $ 0.65 $ 0.73 $ 0.59 $ 2.64 Net income per share diluted: Continuing operations $ 0.59 $ 0.62 $ 0.66 $ 0.54 $ 2.42 Discontinued operations 0.07 0.02 0.06 0.04 0.19 Total $ 0.66 $ 0.64 $ 0.73 $ 0.58 $ 2.60 34 Table of Contents QUARTERLY FINANCIAL INFORMATION (Unaudited) (In millions, except per share data) Quarters First Second Third Fourth Total 2006 Revenues: Processing and services $ 622 $ 603 $ 631 $ 632 $ 2,488 Product 250 263 267 298 1,078 Total revenues 872 866 898 930 3,566 Expenses: Cost of processing and services 387 391 393 407 1,578 Cost of product 195 195 216 233 839 Selling, general and administrative 118 117 120 129 484 Total expenses 700 703 729 769 2,901 Operating income 172 163 169 161 665 Interest expense, net (8 ) (10 ) (12 ) (11 ) (41 ) Income from continuing operations before income taxes 164 153 157 150 624 Income tax provision 63 56 59 58 236 Income from continuing operations 101 97 98 92 388 Income from discontinued operations, net of income taxes 15 21 12 14 62 Net income $ 116 $ 118 $ 110 $ 106 $ 450 Net income per share basic: Continuing operations $ 0.57 $ 0.55 $ 0.56 $ 0.53 $ 2.22 Discontinued operations 0.08 0.12 0.07 0.08 0.35 Total $ 0.65 $ 0.67 $ 0.63 $ 0.62 $ 2.57 Net income per share diluted: Continuing operations $ 0.56 $ 0.55 $ 0.56 $ 0.52 $ 2.19 Discontinued operations 0.08 0.12 0.07 0.08 0.35 Total $ 0.64 $ 0.66 $ 0.63 $ 0.61 $ 2.53
