Item 7: Management Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations The following discussion and analysis of the financial condition and results of operations of WellCare should be read in conjunction with Selected Consolidated and Combined Financial Data and WellCare combined and consolidated financial statements and related notes appearing elsewhere in this filing. The following discussion contains forward-looking statements that involve risks, uncertainties and assumptions that could cause our actual results to differ materially from management expectations. Factors that could cause such differences include those set forth under Risk Factors, Forward-Looking Statements, Business and elsewhere in this filing. 38 Table of Contents Overview We provide managed care services targeted exclusively to government-sponsored healthcare programs, focusing on Medicaid and Medicare. As of December 31, 2004, we operated health plans in Florida, New York, Illinois, Indiana, Connecticut and Louisiana serving approximately 747,000 members. The following tables summarize our membership by state and our membership by program as of December 31, 2004. State Total Members Florida 532,000 New York 69,000 Illinois 67,000 Indiana 45,000 Connecticut 34,000 Program Total Members Medicaid 701,000 Medicare 46,000 The Company recently began offering Medicare services to beneficiaries in Louisiana. As of December 31, 2004, total membership was less than 100. We enter into contracts generally on an annual basis with government agencies that administer health benefits programs. We receive premiums from state and federal agencies for the members that are assigned to or have selected us to provide healthcare services under each benefit program. The amount of premiums we receive for each member is fixed, although it varies according to demographics, including the government program, and the member geographic location, age and sex. Our largest expense is the cost of medical benefits that we provide, which is based primarily on our arrangements with healthcare providers. Our profitability depends on our ability to predict and effectively manage medical benefits expense relative to the fixed premiums we receive. Our arrangements with providers fall into two broad categories: capitation arrangements, where we pay the providers a fixed fee per member, and fee-for-service and risk-sharing arrangements, where we assume all or part of the risk of the cost of the healthcare provided. Generally, capitation payments represent 20% or less of our total medical benefits expense. Other components of medical benefits expense are variable and require estimation and ongoing cost management. Estimation of medical benefits expense is our most significant critical accounting estimate. See Critical Accounting Policies. We use a variety of techniques to manage our medical benefits expense, including payment methods to providers, referral requirements, quality and disease management programs, reinsurance and member co-payments and premiums for some of our Medicare plans. National healthcare costs have been increasing at a higher rate than the general inflation rate, however, and relatively small changes in our medical benefits expense relative to premiums that we receive can create significant changes in our financial results. Changes in healthcare laws, regulations and practices, levels of use of healthcare services, competitive pressures, hospital costs, major epidemics, terrorism or bio-terrorism, new medical technologies and other external factors could reduce our ability to manage our medical benefits expense effectively. One of our primary tools for measuring profitability is our medical benefits ratio, the ratio of our medical benefits expense to the premiums we receive. Changes in the medical benefits ratio from period to period result from changes in Medicaid and Medicare funding, changes in the mix of Medicaid and Medicare membership, our ability to manage medical costs and changes in accounting estimates related to incurred but not reported claims. We use medical benefits ratios both to monitor our management of medical benefits expense and to make various 39 Table of Contents business decisions, including what healthcare plans to offer, what geographic areas to enter or exit and the selection of healthcare providers. Although medical benefits ratios play an important role in our business strategy, we may be willing to enter into provider arrangements that might produce a less favorable medical benefits ratio if those arrangements, such as capitation or risk-sharing, would likely lower our exposure to variability in medical costs. Corporate History and Acquisitions Our WellCare of Florida subsidiary was established in 1985 by a group of physicians located in Tampa, Florida, and began offering Medicaid managed care services in 1994 and Medicare services in 2000. Our HealthEase subsidiary was formed in May 2000 to acquire the business of Tampa General Health Plan, Inc., including its HMO license and approximately 5,900 Medicaid members. HealthEase subsequently acquired almost 100,000 Medicaid members from Humana, Inc. in June 2000. In July 2002, our current management acquired the WellCare group of companies in two concurrent transactions. In the first transaction, we acquired our Florida operations, including our WellCare of Florida and HealthEase subsidiaries, in a stock purchase from a number of individuals, including Dr. Kiran C. Patel and Rupesh Shah, our Senior Vice President, Market Expansion. The purchase price for this transaction consisted of: $50 million in cash; the issuance of a senior subordinated promissory note in the original principal amount of $53 million, subject to adjustments for earnouts and other purchase price adjustments; and warrants to purchase 1,859,704 shares of our common stock. The purchase price was subject to adjustment in both 2003 and 2004, based upon a number of earnouts and other calculations. In February 2004, we entered into a settlement agreement with the selling stockholders that fixed the amount of the purchase price and principal balance of the note at $209.6 million and $119.7 million, respectively. In May 2004, we entered into a further agreement with the selling stockholders, pursuant to which we prepaid $85.0 million of the principal balance of the note, using proceeds from our new senior secured term loan facility, and $3.0 million of the principal balance was forgiven in consideration for the prepayment. In the second transaction, we acquired The WellCare Management Group, Inc., a publicly-traded holding company and the parent company of our New York and Connecticut operations, through a merger of that company into a wholly-owned subsidiary of ours. The purchase price for this transaction consisted of approximately $7.72 million in cash. In June 2004, we acquired Harmony Health Systems, Inc., a provider of Medicaid managed care plans in Illinois and Indiana. As a result of the acquisition, we increased our Medicaid membership by approximately 84,000. The purchase price for the acquisition was approximately $50.3 million in cash, after deducting (i) pre-closing distributions of cash by Harmony to its equityholders and (ii) certain transaction expenses incurred by Harmony or its shareholders. The purchase price is to be adjusted by the amount of any excess or shortfall in the amount of Harmony reserves for medical claims as of December 31, 2003, compared to medical claims actually incurred as of that date as measured on or about December 31, 2004. From May 2002 until July 2004, we were organized as a Delaware limited liability company, WellCare Holdings, LLC. Immediately prior to our initial public offering, WellCare Holdings, LLC merged with and into WellCare Group, Inc., a wholly-owned subsidiary of WellCare Holdings, LLC. At that time, our name changed to WellCare Health Plans, Inc. Each outstanding limited liability company unit of WellCare Holdings, LLC was converted into shares of common stock according to the relative rights and preferences of such units and the initial public offering price of the common stock offered. We are currently identifying markets for potential acquisitions or expansion that would increase our membership and broaden our geographic presence. These potential acquisitions or expansion efforts are at 40 Table of Contents various stages of internal consideration, and we may enter into letters of intent, transactions or other arrangements supporting our growth strategy at any time. However, we cannot predict when or whether such transactions or other arrangements will actually occur, and we may not be successful in completing potential acquisitions. Basis of Presentation WellCare, as it existed prior to the July 31, 2002 acquisition of the WellCare group of companies, is referred to as Predecessor. WellCare, as it existed on and after July 31, 2002, is referred to as the Successor, we or us. The consolidated results of operations include the accounts of the Successor and all of its subsidiaries. Significant intercompany accounts and transactions have been eliminated. The combined results of operations include all of the accounts of the Predecessor entities under common control prior to the July 31, 2002 acquisition of the WellCare group of companies. Significant intercompany accounts and transactions have been eliminated. The combined results of operations of the Predecessor also do not reflect the effects of our change in corporate structure and management. The Predecessor combined financial results do not reflect the effects of: additional debt incurred by Successor management, which results in increased interest expense; a C corporation tax structure, which results in taxes being incurred by us, whereas previously, because the Predecessor had an S corporation tax structure, taxes were incurred by the stockholders; and accounting for amortization of the acquired intangible assets, which resulted from the purchase of the businesses. In addition, due to prior management preparation of the Predecessor for sale, certain costs and expenses were temporarily eliminated and opportunities to increase membership were not pursued during the relevant time periods. WellCare Holdings, LLC was taxed as a partnership for federal income tax purposes. It was not included in the consolidated federal tax return of its subsidiaries, which file as C corporations. See Note 12 to the notes to the WellCare Health Plans, Inc. audited combined and consolidated financial statements appearing elsewhere in this filing. Segments We have two reportable business segments: Medicaid and Medicare. Medicaid, a state administered program, was enacted in 1965 to make federal matching funds available to all states for the delivery of healthcare benefits to eligible individuals, principally those with incomes below specified levels who meet other state specified requirements. Medicaid is structured to allow each state to establish its own eligibility standards, benefits package, payment rates and program administration under broad federal guidelines. Most states determine threshold Medicaid eligibility by reference to other federal financial assistance programs including the Temporary Assistance to Needy Families and Supplemental Security Income programs. The Temporary Assistance to Needy Families program provides assistance to low-income families with children and was adopted to replace the Aid to Families with Dependent Children program. Supplemental Security Income is a federal program that provides assistance to low-income aged, blind or disabled individuals. However, states can broaden eligibility criteria. SCHIP, developed in 1997, is a federal/state matching program that provides healthcare coverage to children not otherwise covered by Medicaid or other insurance programs. SCHIP enables a segment of the large uninsured population in the United States to receive healthcare benefits. States have the option of administering SCHIP through their Medicaid programs. 41 Table of Contents Medicare is a federal program that provides eligible persons age 65 and over and some disabled persons a variety of hospital and medical insurance benefits. Most individuals eligible for Medicare are entitled to receive inpatient hospital care without the payment of any premium, but are required to pay a premium to the federal government, which is adjusted annually, to be eligible for physician care and other services. Under the Medicare Advantage program, managed care plans can contract with CMS to provide health insurance coverage in exchange for a fixed monthly payment per member that varies based on the geographic areas in which the members reside. The fixed monthly payment per member is subject to periodic adjustments determined by CMS based upon a number of factors, including retroactive changes in members status such as Medicaid eligibility, and risk measures based on demographic factors such as age, gender, county of residence and health status. The weighting of the risk measures in the determination of the amount of the periodic adjustments to the fixed monthly payments is being phased in over time. These measures will have their full impact on the calculation of those adjustments by 2007. Individuals who elect to participate in the Medicare Advantage program are relieved of the obligation to pay some or all of the deductible or coinsurance amounts required under the traditional Medicare program, but are generally required to use the service provided by the HMO exclusively and may be required to pay a premium to the federal Medicare program unless the HMO chooses to pay the premium as part of its benefit package. Critical Accounting Policies In the ordinary course of business, we make a number of estimates and assumptions relating to the reporting of our results of operations and financial condition in conformity with accounting principles generally accepted in the United States. We base our estimates on historical experience and on various other assumptions that we believe to be reasonable under the circumstances. Actual results could differ significantly from those estimates under different assumptions and conditions. We believe that the accounting policies discussed below are those that are most important to the portrayal of our financial condition and results and require management most difficult, subjective and complex judgments, often as a result of the need to make estimates about the effect of matters that are inherently uncertain. Revenue recognition. We generate revenues primarily from premiums we receive from agencies of the federal government and the states in which we operate to provide healthcare benefits to our members. We receive a fixed premium per member per month to provide healthcare benefits to our members pursuant to our contracts in each of our markets. We generally receive premiums in advance of providing services, and recognize premium revenue during the period in which we are obligated to provide services to our members. Premiums collected in advance are deferred and reported as unearned premiums. Any amounts that have not been received remain on the balance sheet classified as premiums receivable. We also generate revenues from investments. We experience adjustments to our revenues based on member retroactivity. These retroactivity adjustments reflect changes in the number and eligibility status of enrollees subsequent to when revenue is billed. We estimate the amount of outstanding retroactivity each period and adjust premium revenue accordingly. The estimates of retroactivity adjustments are based on historical trends, premiums billed, the volume of member and contract renewal activity and other information. We refine our estimates and methodologies based upon actual retroactivity experienced. Retroactivity adjustments have not been significant. Estimating medical benefits expense and medical benefits payable. The cost of medical benefits is recognized in the period in which services are provided and includes an estimate of the cost of medical benefits that have been incurred but not yet reported. We contract with various healthcare providers for the provision of certain medical care services to our members and generally compensate those providers on a fee-for-service or capitated basis or pursuant to certain risk-sharing arrangements. Capitation represents fixed payments on a per member per month basis to participating physicians and other medical specialists as compensation for providing comprehensive healthcare services. Participating physician capitation payments for the years ended December 31, 2004, December 31, 2003 and five-month period ended December 31, 2002, and the Predecessor 42 Table of Contents seven-month period ended July 31, 2002 and year ended December 31, 2001 were 13.8%, 11.0%, 10.2%, 10.2% and 10.3%, respectively, of total medical benefits expense. Medical benefits expense has two main components: direct medical expenses and medically-related administrative costs. Direct medical expenses include amounts paid to hospitals, physicians and providers of ancillary services, such as laboratory and pharmacy. Medically-related administrative costs include items such as case and disease management, utilization review services, quality assurance and on-call nurses. Medical benefits payable consists primarily of benefit reserves established for reported and unreported claims, which are unpaid as of the balance sheet date, and contractual liabilities under risk-sharing arrangements, determined through an estimation process utilizing company-specific, industry-wide, and general economic information and data. We have used the same methodology for estimating our medical benefits expense and medical benefits payable since our acquisition of the WellCare group of companies. Our policy is to record management best estimate of medical benefits payable. Monthly, we estimate ultimate benefits payable based upon historical experience and other available information as well as assumptions about emerging trends, which vary by business segment. The process for preparing the estimate utilizes standard actuarial methodologies based on historical data. These standard actuarial methodologies include, among other factors, contractual requirements, historical utilization trends, the interval between the date services are rendered and the date claims are paid, denied claims activity, disputed claims activity, benefit changes, expected health care cost inflation, seasonality patterns and changes in membership. In developing the estimate, we apply different estimation methods depending on the month for which incurred claims are being estimated. For the more recent months, which constitute the majority of the amount of the medical benefits payable, we estimate our claims incurred by applying observed trend factors to the per member per month, or PMPM, costs for prior months, which costs have been estimated using completion factors, in order to estimate the PMPMs for the most recent months. We validate our estimates of the most recent PMPMs by comparing the most recent months utilization levels to the utilization levels in older months, actuarial techniques that incorporate a historical analysis of claim payments, including trends in cost of care provided, and timeliness of submission and processing of claims. Also included in medical benefits payable are estimates for provider settlements due to clarification of contract terms, out-of-network reimbursement and claims payment differences, as well as amounts due to contracted providers under risk-sharing arrangements. Many aspects of the managed care business are not predictable with consistency. These aspects include the incidences of illness or disease state (such as cardiac heart failure cases, cases of upper respiratory illness, the length and severity of the flu season, diabetes, the number of full-term versus premature births, and the number of neonatal intensive care babies). Therefore, we must rely upon our historical experience, as continually monitored, to reflect the ever-changing mix, needs and growth of our members in our trend assumptions. Among the factors considered by management are changes in the level of benefits provided to members, seasonal variations in utilization, identified industry trends and changes in provider reimbursement arrangements, including changes in the percentage of reimbursements made on a capitated as opposed to a fee-for-service basis. These considerations are aggregated in trend in medical benefits expense. Other external factors such as government-mandated benefits or other regulatory changes, catastrophes, and epidemics may impact medical cost trends. Other internal factors such as system conversions and claims processing interruptions may impact our ability to accurately predict estimates of historical completion factors or medical cost trends. Medical cost trends potentially are more volatile than other segments of the economy. Management is required to use considerable judgment in the selection of medical benefits expense trends and other actuarial model inputs. We record reserves for estimated referral claims related to healthcare providers under contract with us who are financially troubled or insolvent and who may not be able to honor their obligations for the costs of medical services provided by other providers. In these instances, we may be required to honor these obligations for legal 43 Table of Contents or business reasons. Based on our current assessment of providers under contract with us, such losses have not been and are not expected to be significant. Changes in estimates of medical benefits payable are primarily the result of obtaining more complete claims information that directly correlates with the claims and provider reimbursement trends. Volatility in members needs for medical services, provider claims submission and our payment processes results in identifiable patterns emerging several months after the causes of deviations from assumed trends occur. Since our estimates are based upon per member, per month claims experience, changes cannot typically be explained by any single factor, but are the result of a number of interrelated variables, all influencing the resulting experienced medical cost trend. Deviations, whether positive or negative, between actual experience and estimates used to establish the liability are recorded in the period known. The following table provides a reconciliation of the beginning and ending balance of medical benefits payable for the following periods: Predecessor Successor Seven-Month Period Ended July 31, 2002 Five-Month Period Ended December 31, 2002 Year Ended December 31, 2003 Year Ended December 31, 2004 Balances as of beginning of period $ 98,314 $ 109,054 $ 113,670 $ 148,297 Opening medical benefits payable related to Harmony Acquisition 18,160 Medical benefits incurred related to: Current period 436,444 348,079 884,703 1,151,948 Prior periods (1,520 ) (6,316 ) (23,650 ) (26,388 ) Total 434,924 341,763 861,053 1,125,560 Medical benefits paid related to: Current period (335,938 ) (249,076 ) (751,826 ) (985,844 ) Prior periods (88,246 ) (88,071 ) (74,600 ) (115,578 ) Total (424,184 ) (337,147 ) (826,426 ) (1,101,422 ) Balances as of end of period $ 109,054 $ 113,670 $ 148,297 $ 190,595 Medical benefits payable recorded at December 31, 2003 developed favorably by approximately $26.4 million. The favorable development was primarily due to realized medical benefits expense trends that were less than initially assumed trends. The Company initially assumed a medical benefits expense trend increase of 6.9% and 3.4% for the Medicaid and Medicare segments, respectively, at December 31, 2003. Based on payments made subsequent to December 31, 2003, for the dates of service prior to December 31, 2003, the realized trends were an increase of 3.4% for the Medicaid segment and a decrease of 3.2% for the Medicare segment. Medical benefits payable recorded at December 31, 2002 developed favorably by approximately $23.7 million. This favorable development was primarily due to realized medical benefits expense trends that were less than initially assumed trends. We initially assumed a medical benefits expense trend increase of 7.8% and a decrease of 4.1% for the Medicaid and Medicare segments, respectively, at December 31, 2002. Based upon payments made subsequent to December 31, 2002, for dates of service prior to December 31, 2002, the realized trends were an increase of 4.5% for the Medicaid segment and a decrease of 5.4% for the Medicare segment. We believe that the amount of medical benefits payable as of December 31, 2004 is adequate to cover our ultimate liability for unpaid claims recorded as of that date; however, actual claim payments and other items may differ from established estimates. Assuming a hypothetical 1% difference between our December 31, 2004 medical benefits ratio due to changes between estimated medical benefits payable and actual medical benefits 44 Table of Contents payable, net income for the year ended December 31, 2004 would have increased or decreased by $8.3 million and diluted earnings per share would have increased or decreased by approximately $0.26 per share, after giving effect to our reorganization into a corporation. Goodwill and intangible assets. We obtained goodwill and intangible assets as a result of the acquisitions of our subsidiaries. Goodwill represents the excess of the cost over the fair market value of net assets acquired. Intangible assets include provider networks, membership contracts, trademark, noncompete agreements, government contracts, licenses and permits. Our intangible assets are amortized over their estimated useful lives ranging from one to 26 years. We evaluate whether events or circumstances have occurred that may affect the estimated useful life or the recoverability of the remaining balance of goodwill and other identifiable intangible assets. We must make assumptions and estimates, such as the discount factor, in determining the estimated fair values. While we believe these assumptions and estimates are appropriate, other assumptions and estimates could be applied and might produce significantly different results. We review goodwill and intangible assets for impairment at least annually, or more frequently if events or changes in circumstances occur that may affect the estimated useful life or the recoverability of the remaining balance of goodwill or intangible assets. Events or changes in circumstances would include significant changes in membership, state funding, medical contracts and provider networks. We have selected the third quarter for our annual impairment test, which generally coincides with the finalization of state and federal contract negotiations and our initial budgeting process. During the third quarter ended September 30, 2004, we assessed the earnings forecast for our two reporting units and concluded that the fair value of the individual reporting units, based upon the expected present value of future cash flows and other qualitative factors, was in excess of net assets of each reporting unit. As of December 31, 2004, we believe that there is no impairment to the value of goodwill or intangible assets. The purchase of our Florida subsidiaries was partially financed through a contingent note payable to the former shareholders of those subsidiaries, including Rupesh Shah, our Senior Vice President, Market Expansion, and his spouse. The principal amount of this note was subject to adjustment for various contingencies including based on the adequacy of the statutory capital of certain subsidiaries, the actual medical benefits payable of certain subsidiaries, the earnings (or losses) of certain products and potential indemnifications under the purchase agreement. Adjustments to the note resulted in a change in the purchase price and the amount of goodwill acquired of $41.6 million. See Corporate History and Acquisitions. In June 2004, we acquired Harmony Health Systems, Inc., a provider of Medicaid managed care plans in Illinois and Indiana. The purchase price for the acquisition was approximately $50.3 million in cash, after deducting (i) pre-closing cash distributions made by Harmony to its equityholders and (ii) certain transaction expenses incurred by Harmony or its shareholders. The purchase price will be either increased or reduced, as applicable, by the amount of Harmony reserves for medical claims as of December 31, 2003 compared to medical claims actually incurred as of that date, as measured on or about December 31, 2004. Goodwill and other intangibles associated with the Harmony acquisition are $40.2 million. 45 Table of Contents Results of Operations The following table sets forth the consolidated and combined statements of income data, expressed as a percentage of revenues for each period indicated. The pro forma combined year ended December 31, 2002 amounts consist of combined financial data from the Predecessor for the seven-month period ended July 31, 2002 and from the Successor for the five-month period ended December 31, 2002. The historical results are not necessarily indicative of results to be expected for any future period. Percentage of Revenues Predecessor/ Successor Successor Pro Forma Combined Year Ended December 31, 2002 (combined) Consolidated Year Ended December 31, 2003 Consolidated Year Ended December 31, 2004 Statement of Operations Data: Revenues: Premium 99.4 % 99.7 % 99.7 % Investment and other income 0.6 % 0.3 % 0.3 % Total revenues 100.0 % 100.0 % 100.0 % Expenses: Medical benefits 84.3 % 82.3 % 80.7 % Selling, general and administrative 10.8 % 12.1 % 12.3 % Depreciation and amortization 0.5 % 0.8 % 0.6 % Interest 0.3 % 1.0 % 0.7 % Total expenses 95.9 % 96.2 % 94.3 % Income before income taxes 4.1 % 3.8 % 5.7 % Income tax expense 0.5 %(1) 1.6 % 2.2 % Net income 3.6 % 2.2 % 3.5 % (1) Income tax expense was not recorded by the Predecessor because its tax structure included entities that had elected subchapter S status under the Internal Revenue Code, the income of which was taxed at the stockholder level, as well as entities that were subject to tax, but did not generate tax liabilities or benefits due to operating losses. The Predecessor financial statements do not reflect any provision for doubtful receivables. The necessity for the provision for doubtful receivables became evident during the second half of 2002, based upon management experience following the acquisition of the WellCare group of companies. Factors considered included the age and amounts of receivables, the effort and timeframe necessary to collect those receivables and the strategic nature of the applicable relationships. Management evaluation of the history of the relationships indicated doubt that certain of the receivables would ultimately be fully collected. Therefore, a provision for the doubtful receivables was deemed to be appropriate and necessary for the years ended 2004 and 2003. Comparison of Year Ended December 31, 2004 to Year Ended December 31, 2003 Premium revenue. For the year ended December 31, 2004, premium revenue increased $348.0 million, or 33%, to $1,390.9 million from $1,042.9 million for the same period last year. The increase was due in part to the addition of 84,000 Medicaid members resulting from the acquisition of Harmony in June 2004, organic growth in our total membership of 19% and rate increases on our products. Total membership grew by 192,000 members, or 35%, from 555,000 at December 31, 2003 to 747,000 at December 31, 2004. Our Medicaid segment includes Medicaid programs and other state-sponsored healthcare programs. For the year ended December 31, 2004, Medicaid segment premium revenue increased $314.9 million, or 43%, to 46 Table of Contents $1,055.0 million from $740.1 million for the same period last year. The increase was primarily due to organic growth in Medicaid membership of 21%, the increase in rates in the State of Florida effective July 1, 2004 of approximately 9%, and the members acquired through the acquisition of Harmony in June 2004. Aggregate membership in the Medicaid segment grew by 189,000 members, or 37%, from 512,000 members at December 31, 2003 to 701,000 at December 31, 2004. For the year ended December 31, 2004, Medicare segment premium revenue increased $46.4 million, or 16%, to $334.8 million from $288.3 million for the same period last year. Growth in premium revenue within the Medicare segment was primarily the result of increased rates received for Medicare members, averaging approximately 10% based on the demographic mix of our membership, and increased membership. Membership within the Medicare segment grew by 4,000 members, or 10%, from 42,000 members at December 31, 2003 to 46,000 members at December 31, 2004. Investment income. For the year ended December 31, 2004, investment income increased $1.2 million, or 38%, to $4.3 million from $3.1 million for the same period last year. The increase was due to greater available cash and investment balances and higher returns in the current interest rate environment. Medical benefits expense. For the year ended December 31, 2004, medical benefits expense increased $264.5 million, or 31%, to $1,125.6 million from $861.1 million for the same period last year. The increase in medical benefits expense was primarily due to organic growth in membership as well as through the acquisition of Harmony in June 2004. The methodology used in estimating medical benefits payable was consistent with prior periods. The medical benefits ratio was 80.9% compared to 82.6% for the same period last year. The medical benefits ratio decreased in 2004 primarily as a result of the increased premium rate received for Medicare members and lower overall utilization of services by our members. Additionally, pharmacy and professional costs were reduced by approximately $1.3 million due to the inaccessibility of services as a result of the four hurricanes that affected the State of Florida during the third quarter of 2004. For the year ended December 31, 2004, Medicaid medical benefits expense increased $241.9 million, or 40%, to $851.2 million from $609.2 million for the same period last year. The increase in medical benefits expense was primarily due to the acquisition of Harmony and organic growth in membership. The membership increase and the inclusion of Harmony accounted for $222.6 million of the increase. Increases in healthcare costs accounted for $15.2 million of the increase, while changes in membership mix resulted in cost increases of $4.1 million. For the year ended December 31, 2004, the Medicaid medical benefits ratio was 80.7% compared to 82.3% for the same period last year. For the year ended December 31, 2004, Medicare medical benefits expense increased $36.4 million, or 15%, to $275.3 million from $238.9 million for the same period last year. The increase was partially due to the growth in membership, which accounted for $13.2 million of the increase. Increased healthcare costs accounted for $22.1 million of the increase with changes in membership mix resulting in cost increases of $1.2 million. For the year ended December 31, 2004, the Medicare medical benefits ratio was 82.3% compared to 82.9% for the same period last year. The medical benefits ratio decreased as a result of the premium rate increases and lower overall utilization. Selling, general and administrative expense. For the year ended December 31, 2004, selling, general and administrative expense increased $45.2 million, or 36%, to $171.3 million from $126.1 million for the same period last year. Our selling, general and administrative expense to revenue ratio was 12.3% and 12.1% for the years ended December 31, 2004 and 2003, respectively. The increase in selling, general and administrative expense was primarily due to investments in information technology, investments in sales and marketing strategies and increased spending necessary to support and sustain our membership growth. Interest expense. Interest expense was $10.2 million for the years ended December 31, 2004 and 2003. Interest expense for the year ended December 31, 2004 is reduced by an approximately $0.7 million net gain on early repayment of long term indebtedness. 47 Table of Contents Income tax expense. Income tax expense for the year ended December 31, 2004 was $31.3 million with an effective tax rate of 38.8% as compared to $17.0 million with an effective tax rate of 41.9% for the same period last year. This decrease was due to increased investment in tax-exempt securities, more effective state tax planning in the current year and additional taxes incurred in the third quarter of last year as a result of the purchase price adjustments arising from the acquisition of the WellCare group of companies in August 2002. Net income. For the year ended December 31, 2004, net income was $49.3 million compared to $23.5 million for the same period last year, representing an increase of 109%. Comparison of Consolidated Year Ended December 31, 2003 to Combined Year Ended December 31, 2002 Premium revenue. Premium revenue for the year ended December 31, 2003 increased $127.0 million, or 14%, to $1.04 billion from $915.9 million for the combined year ended December 31, 2002. The increase was principally due to internal growth in overall membership within the Medicaid segment and to a lesser extent increased premium rates per member. Premium rate increases were partially offset by a lower average premium per member primarily as a result of changes in the demographics of Medicaid members by product. During 2003, membership increased by 85,000 members, or 18%, from 470,000 members at December 31, 2002 to 555,000 members at December 31, 2003. Medicaid segment premium revenue for the year ended December 31, 2003 increased $143.0 million, or 24%, to $740.1 million from $597.1 million for the combined year ended December 31, 2002. The increase was primarily due to an increase in membership of approximately $166.7 million and a change in membership demographics and premium rates, which offset the increase by $23.7 million. During 2003, membership within the Medicaid segment increased 92,000 members, or 22%, from 420,000 members at December 31, 2002 to 512,000 members at December 31, 2003. Membership increased by approximately 44,000 as a result of assignment of SCHIP members in Florida under a competitive bidding process, and the remaining growth in Medicaid membership resulted from a combination of mandatory assignment and successful marketing efforts. Medicare segment premium revenue for the year ended December 31, 2003 decreased $2.6 million, or 1.0%, to $288.3 million from $290.9 million for the combined year ended December 31, 2002. The decrease was primarily due to a decrease in the aggregate time our members were covered by our plans, partially offset by an increase in premium rates and change in membership demographics of approximately $7.2 million. We continually review the medical loss ratio of our business and make strategic decisions based on those analyses. During 2003, our medical benefits expense in certain areas of Florida was higher than expected. We addressed this concern by withdrawing from areas where financial performance was unfavorable. Overall membership levels remained flat at approximately 42,000. Investment income. Investment income for the year ended December 31, 2003 decreased $2.9 million, or 53%, to $2.6 million from $5.5 million for the combined year ended December 31, 2002. The decrease in investment income was primarily due to the continued decline in market interest rates and maintaining investments with shorter maturities, which was partially offset by an increase in overall cash levels. Cash levels increased primarily due to increased profitability and differences in the timing of our receipt of premiums as compared to the timing of our payment of the related medical benefits expense. Medical benefits expense. Medical benefits expenses for the year ended December 31, 2003 increased $84.4 million, or 11%, to $861.1 million from $776.7 million for the combined year ended December 31, 2002. The increase was primarily due to the increase in membership. The medical benefits ratio, as a percentage of premium revenue, for the year ended December 31, 2003 was 82.6% compared to 84.8% in 2002. The medical benefits ratio decreased in 2003 primarily as a result of our initiatives to enter into contracts with providers that offer more economical benefits, to focus on preventative and disease management programs, and to increase the effectiveness of medical management to ensure that medical benefits are utilized efficiently. 48 Table of Contents The Medicaid segment medical benefits expense for the year ended December 31, 2003 increased $112.5 million, or 23%, to $609.2 million from $496.7 million for the combined year ended December 31, 2002. The increase was principally due to internal growth in overall membership within the Medicaid segment, which accounted for an increase of $138.7 million, and to a lesser extent increased healthcare costs, which accounted for an increase of $3.8 million. This was offset by $30.0 million resulting from a change in membership demographics. The Medicaid medical benefits ratio, as a percentage of premium revenue, for the year ended December 31, 2003 was 82.3% compared to 83.2% in 2002. Medicare segment medical benefits expense for the year ended December 31, 2003 decreased $14.3 million, or 6%, to $238.9 million from $253.2 million for the combined year ended December 31, 2002. The decrease was principally a result of our withdrawal from certain areas of Florida where financial performance was unfavorable and, to a lesser extent, as a result of revised contracts with providers containing improved contract terms. The decrease in membership accounted for $8.5 million of the reduction in expense, and the changes in contract terms accounted for the remainder. The Medicare medical benefits ratio, as a percentage of premium revenue, for the year ended December 31, 2003 was 82.9% compared to 87.0% in 2002. Selling, general and administrative expense. Selling, general and administrative expense for the year ended December 31, 2003 increased $26.2 million, or 26%, to $126.1 million from $99.9 million for the combined year ended December 31, 2002. Our selling, general and administrative expense to premium revenue ratio was 12.1% and 10.8% for the years ended December 31, 2003 and 2002, respectively. The increase in the ratio was the result of increased marketing efforts, servicing our increased membership, amortization of purchased intangible assets and costs incurred to strengthen our infrastructure. These costs include additional management staff, information technology system enhancements, and consulting services. Additionally, certain expenses to expand the business or make the operations more efficient were not incurred in 2002 as the predecessor management was preparing the company for sale. Interest expense. Interest expense for the year ended December 31, 2003 increased $7.3 million, or 252%, to $10.2 million from $2.9 million for the combined year ended December 31, 2002. The increase was due to increased debt as a result of the purchase of the business from the predecessor owners. Income tax expense. Income tax expense for the year ended December 31, 2003 increased $12.2 million, or 254%, to $17.0 million from $4.8 million for the combined year ended December 31, 2002. The increase resulted from being taxed as a C corporation for 12 months in 2003 compared to being taxed as a C corporation for only five months in 2002. Prior to August 1, 2002, our Predecessor was an S corporation and was a disregarded entity for federal and state income taxes. Our effective tax rate for the year ended December 31, 2003 was 41.9% and for the five-month period ended December 31, 2002 was 50.8%. Net income. Net income for the year ended December 31, 2003 was $23.5 million compared to $32.6 million for the combined year ended December 31, 2002. Liquidity and Capital Resources We have financed our operations principally through internally generated funds. We generate cash mainly from premium revenue. Our primary use of cash is the payment of expenses related to medical benefits and administrative expenses. We generally receive premium revenue in advance of payment of claims for related healthcare services. We expect that our future funding for working capital needs, capital expenditures, long-term debt repayments, dividends and other financing activities will continue to be provided from these resources. In July 2004, we received $112.3 million of net proceeds from our initial public offering. Additionally, in December 2004, we received $44.9 million of net proceeds from a secondary offering. From time to time, we may need to raise additional capital or draw on our credit facility to fund planned geographic and product expansion or acquire healthcare businesses. 49 Table of Contents Each of our existing and projected sources of cash are impacted by operational and financial risks that influence the overall amount of cash generated and the capital available to us. For a further discussion of risks that can impact our liquidity, see our risk factors beginning on Page 18. Because we generally receive premiums in advance of payments of claims for healthcare services, we maintain estimated balances of cash and cash equivalents pending payment of claims. At December 31, 2004 and December 31, 2003, cash and cash equivalents were $397.6 million and $237.3 million, respectively. We also had short-term investments with maturities of three to 12 months of $75.5 million and $33.8 million at December 31, 2004 and December 31, 2003, respectively. Our investment policies are designed primarily to provide liquidity and preserve capital. The states in which we operate prescribe the types of instruments in which our subsidiaries may invest their funds. As of December 31, 2004 and December 31, 2003, a substantial portion of our cash was invested in certificates of deposit and a portfolio of highly liquid money market securities with a weighted average maturity of 30 days and 138 days, respectively. The average portfolio yield for the year ended December 31, 2004 and year ended December 31, 2003 was approximately 1.5% and 1.2%, respectively. Overview of Cash Flow Activities For the years ended December 31, 2004 and 2003 our cash flows from operations are summarized as follows: 2004 2003 Net cash provided by operations $ 48,762 $ 122,798 Net cash used in by investing activities (96,466 ) (18,313 ) Net cash provided by (used in) financing activities 208,010 (13,948 ) Cash Provided by Operations . The growth in cash from operations was primarily due to increased membership, improved profitability and changes in outstanding receivables and liabilities on the timing of cash receipts and payments. Because we generally receive premium revenue in advance of payment for the related medical care costs, our cash has historically increased during period of enrollment growth. Cash Used In Investing Activities . The increase in cash used in investing activities is due to our acquisition of Harmony in June 2004 which required a net cash outlay of $36.5 million. We invested excess cash obtained from our public offerings and operations totaling approximately $41.7 million. To fulfill certain State requirements, $9.5 million was invested into restricted investment accounts. A total of $8.7 million was invested in property and equipment, principally at the Company new location. Cash From Financing Activities . The change in cash from financing activities is primarily due to the public offerings which generated net proceeds of $157.5 million. Additionally, the Company obtained $159.2 million from the proceeds of a new debt issuance. These proceeds were partially offset by payments made on existing debt facilities totaling approximately $108.8 million. Regulatory Capital and Restrictions on Dividends. Our operations are conducted through our HMO subsidiaries. These subsidiaries are subject to state regulations that, among other things, may require the maintenance of minimum levels of statutory capital, as defined by each state. These regulations may restrict the amount, payment, and timing of the distribution of dividends that may be paid to our parent company. The states can, in their sole discretion, require individual subsidiaries to maintain statutory capital levels higher than state mandated minimums. Management believes that we were in compliance with all minimum statutory capital requirements at December 31, 2004, and will continue to be so for the foreseeable future. The National Association of Insurance Commissioners has adopted rules which, to the extent they are implemented by the states in which we operate, set minimum capitalization requirements for subsidiaries and other risk bearing entities. The requirements take the form of risk-based capital rules. Florida and New York 50 Table of Contents have not yet adopted the risk-based capital standard as a net worth requirement. Our operations in Illinois, Indiana, Connecticut and Louisiana are subject to the National Association of Insurance Commissioners guidance. Our subsidiaries are required to maintain minimum capital amounts as prescribed by the various states in which we operate. Our restricted assets consist of cash and cash equivalents that are deposited or pledged to state agencies in accordance with state rules and regulations. At December 31, 2004 and 2003, all of our restricted assets consisted of cash and cash equivalents. As of December 31, 2004 and 2003, all of our subsidiaries were in compliance with the minimum capital requirements. Barring any change in regulatory requirements, we believe that we will continue to be in compliance with these requirements at least through 2005. New York regulators have proposed a 150% increase in reserve requirements to be implemented over a six-year period, which would materially increase the capital requirements of our New York managed care plan. If our regulators were to deny or significantly further restrict our subsidiaries ability to pay dividends to us or to pay management fees to our affiliates, the funds available to us as a whole would be limited, which could harm our ability to implement our business strategy. For example, we could be hindered in our ability to make debt service payments on amounts drawn from our credit facility. Debt and Credit Facilities. As part of the consideration for the acquisition of the WellCare group of companies, we issued a senior subordinated non-negotiable promissory note in the original principal amount of $53.0 million to the stockholder representative on behalf of the stockholders of the Florida business, including Rupesh Shah, our Senior Vice President, Market Expansion, and his spouse. In February 2004, we entered into a settlement agreement with the selling stockholders that fixed the remaining amount of the seller note at $119.7 million. In May 2004, we entered into a further agreement with the selling stockholders, pursuant to which we prepaid $85.0 million of the principal balance of the note, using proceeds from the senior secured term loan facility described below, and $3.0 million of the principal balance was forgiven in consideration of that prepayment. In August 2004, we prepaid an additional $3.2 million of the principal balance of the note. The remaining balance of the note, $25.0 million, is due on September 15, 2006, and would be due immediately upon a sale of our business. Interest on the principal amount of the note accrues at the rate of 5.25% per year. In May 2004, we entered into a credit agreement pursuant to which we obtained two senior secured credit facilities, consisting of a term loan facility in an amount of $160.0 million and a revolving credit facility in the amount of $50.0 million, of which $10.0 million is available for short-term borrowings on a swingline basis. These facilities are provided by a group of banks and other financial institutions led by Credit Suisse First Boston and Morgan Stanley Senior Funding, Inc. We used the proceeds from the term loan to prepay $85.0 million of the principal balance of the seller note discussed above, to prepay in full, for $18.3 million, certain senior discount notes previously issued by one of our subsidiaries, to pay the $50.3 million purchase price for the Harmony acquisition, and to pay approximately $4.3 million in transaction fees and expenses. No amounts had been drawn on the $50.0 million revolving credit facility since its inception. Each of these credit facilities has a floating interest rate based on a specified margin over, at our option, the Eurodollar rate or the higher of the prime rate or the federal funds effective rate. The term loan facility requires quarterly payments of 1% of the outstanding principal through the maturity date, with the balance due on the maturity date, and any principal amount outstanding under the revolving credit facility would be payable on its maturity date. The term loan facility will mature in May 2009, and the revolving credit facility will mature in May 2008. Our credit facilities include financial and operational covenants that limit our ability to incur additional indebtedness as well as purchase or dispose of significant assets. Covenants in the credit facilities include maintenance of a fixed charge coverage ratio above a set minimum, maintenance of a leverage ratio below a set maximum, and limitations on capital expenditures and acquisitions. We believe that we were in compliance with all of these covenants as of December 31, 2004. As of December 31, 2004, we did not have any off-balance sheet arrangements that are required to be disclosed under Item 303(a)(4)(ii) of SEC Regulation S-K. 51 Table of Contents In May 2004, our debt was rated below investment grade by the major credit rating agencies as follows: Agency Outlook Credit Rating Moody Stable B2 Standard & Poor Stable B Consequently, if we seek to raise funds in capital markets transactions, our ability to do so will be limited to issuing additional non-investment grade debt or issuing equity and/or equity-linked instruments. We expect to fund our working capital requirements and capital expenditures during the next several years from our cash flow from operations, from public offerings or other possible future capital markets transactions. We have taken a number of steps to increase our internally generated cash flow, including reducing our health care expenses by, among other things, exiting from unprofitable markets and undertaking cost savings initiatives. If our cash flow is less than we expect due to one or more of the risks described in Risk Factors, or our cash flow requirements increase for reasons we do not currently foresee, then we may need to draw upon available funds under our revolving line of credit, which matures in May 2008, or issue additional debt or equity securities. Because we currently intend to make select acquisitions as part of our growth strategy, we likely will draw upon such funds and credit facilities and/or issue additional debt or equity securities. Based on the above, we believe that we will be able to adequately fund our current and long-term capital needs. A failure to comply with any covenant in our credit facilities could make funds under our credit facilities unavailable. We also may be required to take additional actions to reduce our cash flow requirements, including the deferral of planned investments aimed at reducing our selling, general and administrative expenses. The deferral or cancellation of any investments could have a material adverse impact on our ability to meet our short-term business objectives. We regularly evaluate cash requirements for current operations and commitments, and for capital acquisitions and other strategic transactions. We may elect to raise additional funds for these purposes either through additional debt or equity, the sale of investment securities or otherwise as appropriate. Commitments and Contingencies The following table sets forth information regarding our contractual obligations: Payments due to period Contractual Obligations at December 31, 2004 Total Less than 1 Year 1-3 Years 3-5 Years More than 5 Years (in thousands) Long-term debt(1) $ 184,200 $ 1,600 $ 28,200 $ 154,400 $ Operating leases 31,997 5,129 9,565 9,547 7,756 Other liabilities 1,349 1,349 Total $ 217,546 $ 8,078 $ 37,765 $ 163,947 $ 7,756 (1) Long-term debt (including current maturities) at December 31, 2004 includes total short and long-term debt of $183,501 plus the unamortized portion of the discount on the term loan of $699. We are not an obligor under or guarantor of any indebtedness of any other party; however, we may have to pay referral claims of healthcare providers under contract with us who are not able to pay costs of medical services provided by other providers. We have no off-balance sheet financing arrangements except for the operating leases described above. Recent Accounting Pronouncements In January 2003, the FASB issued Interpretation No. 46, Consolidation of Variable Interest Entities. This interpretation of Accounting Research Bulletin No. 51, Consolidated Financial Statements, addresses 52 Table of Contents consolidation by business enterprises of variable interest entities that either: (1) do not have sufficient equity investment at risk to permit the entity to finance its activities without additional subordinated financial support, or (2) have equity investors that lack an essential characteristic of a controlling financial interest. As of December 31, 2003, we did not have any entities that require disclosure or new consolidation as a result of the adoption of FASB Interpretation No. 46. In December 2004, SFAS No. 123(R), Share-Based Payment, which addresses the accounting for employee stock options, was issued. SFAS 123(R) revises the disclosure provisions of SFAS 123, Accounting for Stock Based Compensation and supercedes APB Opinion No. 25, Accounting for Stock Issued to Employees. SFAS 123(R) requires that the cost of all employee stock options, as well as other equity-based compensation arrangements, be reflected in the financial statements based on the estimated fair value of the awards. This statement is effective for all public entities who file as of the beginning of the first interim or annual reporting period that begins after June 15, 2005. The Company has not elected to implement SFAS 123(R) for the year ended December 31, 2004.
