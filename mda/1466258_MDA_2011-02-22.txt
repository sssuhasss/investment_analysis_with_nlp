Item 7. MANAGEMENT S DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS OF FINANCIAL CONDITION AND RESULTS OF OPERATIONS The following Management Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations contains forward-looking statements that involve risks and uncertainties. Our actual results may differ materially from the results discussed in the forward-looking statements. Factors that might cause a difference include, but are not limited to, those discussed under Item 1A. Risk Factors in this Annual Report on Form 10-K. The following section is qualified in its entirety by the more detailed information, including our financial statements and the notes thereto, which appears elsewhere in this Annual Report. Overview Organization Ingersoll-Rand plc (IR-Ireland), an Irish public limited company, and its consolidated subsidiaries (we, our, the Company) is a diversified, global company that provides products, services and solutions to enhance the quality and comfort of air in homes and buildings, transport and protect food and perishables, secure homes and commercial properties, and increase industrial productivity and efficiency. Our business segments consist of Climate Solutions, Residential Solutions, Industrial Technologies and Security Technologies, each with strong brands and leading positions within their respective markets. We generate revenue and cash primarily through the design, manufacture, sale and service of a diverse portfolio of industrial and commercial products that include well-recognized, premium brand names such as Club Car , Hussmann , Ingersoll-Rand , Schlage , Thermo King and Trane . To achieve our mission of becoming a world leader in creating safe, comfortable and efficient environments, as well as to become a more diversified company with strong growth and profitability prospects, we transformed our enterprise portfolio by divesting cyclical, low-growth and asset-intensive businesses. In addition, our acquisition strategy has helped deliver more consistent revenue and earnings performance across all phases of the economic cycle. Aside from our portfolio transformation, we continue to focus on increasing our recurring revenue stream, which includes revenues from parts, service, used equipment and rentals. We also intend to continuously improve the efficiencies, capabilities, products and services of our high-potential businesses. On July 1, 2009, Ingersoll-Rand Company Limited (IR-Limited), a Bermuda company, completed a reorganization to change the jurisdiction of incorporation of the parent company of Ingersoll Rand from Bermuda to Ireland (the Ireland Reorganization). As a result, IR-Ireland replaced IR-Limited as the ultimate parent company effective July 1, 2009. In conjunction with the Ireland Reorganization, IR-Limited became a wholly-owned subsidiary of IR-Ireland and the Class A common shareholders of IR-Limited became ordinary shareholders of IR-Ireland. All references related to the Company prior to July 1, 2009 relate to IR-Limited. Ireland Reorganization On March 5, 2009, our board of directors approved a reorganization of the Company that would change the jurisdiction of incorporation of our parent company from Bermuda to Ireland. The first step in the Ireland Reorganization was the establishment of IR-Limited tax residency in Ireland, which occurred in March 2009. Subsequently, IR-Ireland replaced IR-Limited as the ultimate parent company pursuant to a scheme of arrangement under Bermuda law. The Ireland Reorganization was accounted for as a reorganization of entities under common control and accordingly, did not result in any changes to the consolidated amounts of assets, liabilities and equity. As a result of the Ireland Reorganization, IR-Limited became a wholly-owned subsidiary of IR-Ireland and the Class A common shareholders of IR-Limited became ordinary shareholders of IR-Ireland. On July 1, 2009, IR-Limited completed the transfer of all the outstanding shares of Ingersoll-Rand Global Holding Company Limited (IR-Global) to Ingersoll-Rand International Holding Limited (IR-International), another wholly-owned indirect subsidiary of IR-Limited incorporated in Bermuda, whereupon IR-International assumed the obligations of IR-Limited as an issuer or guarantor, as the case may be, under the indentures 26 Table of Contents governing our outstanding notes, medium-term notes and debentures. IR-Ireland and IR-Limited also fully and unconditionally guarantee the payment obligations of IR-International, IR-Global and Ingersoll-Rand Company, a wholly-owned indirect subsidiary of IR-Limited incorporated in New Jersey (IR-New Jersey), as the case may be, as the issuers of debt securities under these indentures. Neither IR-Ireland nor IR-Limited has issued or intends to issue guarantees in respect of any public indebtedness incurred by Trane. In addition, any securities issued by the Company that were convertible, exchangeable or exercisable into Class A common shares of IR-Limited became convertible, exchangeable or exercisable, as the case may be, into the ordinary shares of IR-Ireland. On July 1, 2009, IR-Global amended and restated its commercial paper program (the Commercial Paper Program) pursuant to which IR-Global may issue, on a private placement basis, unsecured commercial paper notes up to a maximum aggregate amount outstanding at any time of $2.25 billion. The maximum aggregate amount under the program was reduced to $2.00 billion in November 2010 following the reduction in our available credit facilities in May 2010. Under the Commercial Paper Program, IR-Global may issue notes from time to time, and the proceeds of the financing will be used for general corporate purposes. Each of IR-Ireland, IR-Limited and IR-International has provided an irrevocable and unconditional guarantee for the notes issued under the Commercial Paper Program. The Company had two credit facilities outstanding as of July 1, 2009. Pursuant to the terms of these credit facilities, which were entered into on August 12, 2005 and June 27, 2008, IR-Ireland and IR-International became guarantors to such credit facilities on July 1, 2009. In connection therewith, IR-Ireland and IR-International entered into Addendums on July 1, 2009 to become parties to these credit facilities. In May 2010, the 5-year $1.25 billion credit facility entered into on August 12, 2005 was replaced by a 3-year $1.0 billion Senior Unsecured Revolving Credit Facility. Each of IR-Ireland, IR-Limited and IR-International has provided an irrevocable and unconditional guarantee for the May 2010 credit facility. In connection with the Ireland Reorganization, effective as of July 1, 2009, IR-Ireland assumed the existing obligations of IR-Limited under the equity incentive plans and other similar employee award plans of Ingersoll Rand (collectively, the Plans), including all awards issued thereunder. Furthermore, the Plans have been amended to provide (1) that ordinary shares of IR-Ireland will be issued, held available or used to measure benefits as appropriate under the Plans, in lieu of shares of IR-Limited, including upon exercise of any options or share appreciation rights or upon the vesting of restricted stock units or performance units issued under those Plans; and (2) for the appropriate substitution of IR-Ireland for IR-Limited in those Plans. The Ireland Reorganization did not have a material impact on our financial results. Ingersoll-Rand plc continues to be subject to United States Securities and Exchange Commission reporting requirements and prepares financial statements in accordance with U.S. Generally Accepted Accounting Principles (GAAP). Shares of Ingersoll-Rand plc continue to trade on the New York Stock Exchange under the symbol IR , the same symbol under which the Ingersoll-Rand Company Limited Class A common shares previously traded. Trends and Economic Events We are a global corporation with worldwide operations. As a global business, our operations are affected by worldwide, regional and industry-specific economic factors, as well as political factors, wherever we operate or do business. Our geographic and industry diversity, as well as the diversity of our product sales and services, has helped limit the impact of any one industry or the economy of any single country on our consolidated operating results. Since the onset of the economic downturn in 2008, we have seen weaker demand for many of our products and services across each of our businesses. Consumers and businesses have reduced spending and investment. As a result of the reduced end-market activity, we initiated restructuring actions at the end of 2008 targeted at streamlining the footprint of manufacturing facilities and reducing the general and administrative cost base across all of our businesses. Given the broad range of products manufactured and geographic markets served, management uses a variety of factors to predict the outlook for the Company. We monitor key competitors and customers in order to gauge 27 Table of Contents relative performance and the outlook for the future. In addition, our order rates are indicative of future revenue and thus a key measure of anticipated performance. In those industry segments where we are a capital equipment provider, revenues depend on the capital expenditure budgets and spending patterns of our customers, who may delay or accelerate purchases in reaction to changes in their businesses and in the economy. During 2010, current market conditions continued to impact our financial results. The U.S. and European non-residential construction markets remain weak. However, we experienced modest volume growth in some of our other major end markets. As economic conditions continue to stabilize, we expect this modest revenue growth to continue along with the continued benefits of restructuring savings and productivity programs. Despite the current market environment, we have a solid foundation of global brands and leading market shares in all of our major product lines. Our growing geographic and industry diversity coupled with our large installed product base provides growth opportunities within our service, parts and replacement revenue streams. In addition, we are investing substantial resources to innovate and develop new products and services which will fuel our future growth. Acquisition of Trane At the close of business on June 5, 2008 (the Acquisition Date), we completed the acquisition of 100% of the outstanding common shares of Trane Inc. (Trane). Trane, previously named American Standard Companies Inc., provides systems and services that enhance the quality and comfort of the air in homes and buildings around the world. Trane systems and services have leading positions in premium commercial, residential, institutional and industrial markets, a reputation for reliability, high quality and product innovation and a powerful distribution network. Trane 2007 annual revenues were $7.5 billion. We paid a combination of (i) 0.23 of an IR-Limited Class A common share and (ii) $36.50 in cash, without interest, for each outstanding share of Trane common stock. The total cost of the acquisition was approximately $9.6 billion, including change in control payments and direct costs of the transaction. We financed the cash portion of the acquisition with a combination of cash on hand, commercial paper and a 364-day senior unsecured bridge loan facility. The components of the purchase price were as follows: In billions Cash consideration $ 7.3 Stock consideration (Issuance of 45.4 million IR-Limited Class A common shares) 2.0 Estimated fair value of Trane stock options converted to 7.4 million IR-Limited stock options 0.2 Transaction costs 0.1 Total $ 9.6 As a result of the acquisition, the results of the operations of Trane have been included in the statement of financial position at December 31, 2010 and 2009 and the consolidated statements of operations and cash flows for the full years of 2010 and 2009, and since the Acquisition Date in 2008. For further details on the acquisition of Trane, see Note 4 to the Consolidated Financial Statements. Significant events in 2010 Business Divestitures On December 30, 2010, we completed the divestiture of our gas microturbine generator business, which was sold under the Energy Systems brand, to Flex Energy, LLC. The business, which was previously reported as part of the Industrial Technologies segment, designs, manufactures, markets, distributes, and services gas powered microturbine generators which feature energy efficient design and low emissions technology. As a result of the sale, we have reported this business as a discontinued operation and have classified the assets and liabilities as held for sale for all periods presented. 28 Table of Contents On October 4, 2010, we completed the divestiture of our European refrigerated display case business, which was sold under the KOXKA brand, to an affiliate of American Industrial Acquisition Corporation (AIAC Group). The business, which was previously reported as part of the Climate Solutions segment, designs, manufactures and markets commercial refrigeration equipment through sales branches and a network of distributors throughout Europe, Africa and the Middle East. KOXKA had two manufacturing facilities in Spain and employed 445 people. As a result of the sale, we have reported this business as a discontinued operation and have classified the assets and liabilities as held for sale for all periods presented. Healthcare Reform In March 2010, the Patient Protection and Affordable Care Act (the Act) and the Healthcare and Education Reconciliation Bill of 2010 (together with the Act, the Healthcare Reform Legislation) was signed into law. As a result, effective 2013, the tax benefits available to us will be reduced to the extent our prescription drug expenses are reimbursed under the Medicare Part D retiree drug subsidy program. Although the provisions of the Healthcare Reform Legislation relating to the retiree drug subsidy program do not take effect until 2013, we are required to recognize the full accounting impact in our financial statements in the reporting period in which the Healthcare Reform Legislation is enacted. As retiree healthcare liabilities and related tax impacts are already reflected in our financial statements, the Healthcare Reform Legislation resulted in a non-cash charge to income tax expense in the first quarter of 2010 of $40.5 million. Currently, our retiree medical plans receive the retiree drug subsidy under Medicare Part D. No later than 2014, a significant portion of the drug coverage will be moved to an Employer Group Waiver Plan while retaining the same benefit provisions. This change resulted in an actuarial gain which decreased our December 31, 2010 retiree medical plan liability, as well as the net actuarial losses in other comprehensive income by $41.1 million. At this time, there were no other changes to our liabilities as a result of the Healthcare Reform Legislation. We will continue to monitor Healthcare Reform Legislation to review provisions which could impact our accounting for retiree medical benefits in future periods. We may consider future plan amendments, which may have accounting implications as further regulations are promulgated and interpretations of the legislation become available. The Healthcare Reform Legislation could also impact our accounting for income taxes in future periods. We will continue to assess the accounting implications of the Healthcare Reform Legislation. Venezuela Devaluation During the fourth quarter of 2009, the blended Consumer Price Index/National Consumer Price Index of Venezuela reached a cumulative three-year inflation rate in excess of 100%. As a result, Venezuela was designated as highly inflationary effective January 1, 2010. Accordingly, the U.S. dollar was determined to be the functional currency of our Venezuelan subsidiaries and all foreign currency fluctuations during 2010 have been recorded in income. At December 31, 2009, we remeasured our foreign currency receivables and payables associated with the Venezuelan Bolivar at the parallel rate of 6.0 Bolivars for each U.S. dollar. This was based on our inability to settle certain transactions through the official government channels in an expeditious manner. Previously, we remeasured all foreign currency transactions at the official rate of 2.15 Bolivars to the U.S. dollar. As a result, we recorded a $24 million charge in the fourth quarter of 2009 associated with the devaluation. On May 17, 2010, the government of Venezuela effectively closed down the parallel market claiming it was a significant cause of inflation in Venezuela. On June 9, 2010, a new parallel market (SITME) opened under control of the Central Bank and the Company has utilized it for currency exchange, subject to any limitations under local regulations. At December 31, 2010, we continue to utilize the SITME rate for re-measurement purposes. 29 Table of Contents Significant events in 2009 In the fourth quarter of 2009, we realigned our external reporting structure to more closely reflect our corporate and business strategies and to promote additional productivity and growth. Our segments are now as follows: Climate Solutions, Residential Solutions, Industrial Technologies and Security Technologies. As part of the change, we eliminated the Air Conditioning Systems and Services segment which represented the acquired Trane business and created two new reportable segments, the Climate Solutions segment and the Residential Solutions segment. During 2009, we completed a comprehensive financing program that significantly enhanced our liquidity and debt profile. Significant actions included the repayment of the outstanding balance of our senior unsecured bridge loan facility with the proceeds from the issuance of $1.0 billion of long-term debt (Senior Notes and Exchangeable Senior Notes) and the expansion of our Trane accounts receivable purchase program to encompass originators from all four of our business segments. In addition, we reduced our quarterly stock dividend from $0.18 per share to $0.07 per share, effective with our September 2009 payment. On February 17, 2010, we terminated the expanded accounts receivable purchase program prior to its expiration in March 2010. In the fourth quarter of 2008, we initiated enterprise-wide restructuring actions in order to streamline both our manufacturing footprint and our general and administrative cost base. We incurred approximately $109.6 million of costs associated with this program during 2009. These combined restructuring actions generated approximately $155 million of annual pretax savings for 2010. We continue to invest in ongoing restructuring activities in an effort to increase efficiencies across all of our businesses. Significant events in 2008 As discussed in Acquisition of Trane above, on June 5, 2008, we acquired 100% of the outstanding common shares of Trane for approximately $9.6 billion. In August 2008, we filed a universal shelf registration statement with the Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC) for an indeterminate amount of securities for future issuance and issued $1.6 billion of long-term debt pursuant to the shelf registration statement. Approximately, $1.4 billion remains outstanding as of December 31, 2010 as the Company repaid $250 million as it became due during 2010. The remaining balance consists of $600 million 6.000% Senior Notes due in 2013 and $750 million 6.875% Senior Notes due in 2018. These notes are fully and unconditionally guaranteed by IR-Limited, which directly owns 100% of the subsidiary issuer, IR-Global. The net proceeds from the offering were used to partially reduce the amount outstanding under the senior unsecured bridge loan facility, which had a balance of $754 million at December 31, 2008. In the fourth quarter of 2008, we tested goodwill and other indefinite-lived intangible assets for impairment. As a result of decreased global equity valuations, the tightening of industrial and retail end markets and a resulting decline in our 2009 projected financial performance, we incurred a non-cash pre-tax impairment charge of $3,710.0 million, $3,385.0 million after-tax. 30 Table of Contents Results of Operations Dollar amounts in millions, except per share data 2010 % of Revenues 2009 % of Revenues 2008 % of Revenues Net revenues $ 14,079.1 $ 13,101.8 $ 13,045.0 Cost of goods sold (10,158.5 ) 72.1 % (9,542.2 ) 72.8 % (9,547.5 ) 73.2 % Selling and administrative expenses (2,673.1 ) 19.0 % (2,687.3 ) 20.5 % (2,308.9 ) 17.7 % Asset impairment - - (3,710.0 ) Operating income (loss) 1,247.5 8.9 % 872.3 6.7 % (2,521.4 ) -19.3 % Interest expense (283.2 ) (301.6 ) (243.2 ) Other, net 42.3 18.7 63.9 Earnings (loss) before income taxes 1,006.6 589.4 (2,700.7 ) (Provision) benefit for income taxes (224.8 ) (79.6 ) 192.3 Earnings (loss) from continuing operations 781.8 509.8 (2,508.4 ) Discontinued operations, net of tax (116.7 ) (33.6 ) (96.4 ) Net earnings (loss) 665.1 476.2 (2,604.8 ) Less: Net earnings attributable to noncontrolling interests (22.9 ) (24.9 ) (20.0 ) Net earnings (loss) attributable to Ingersoll-Rand plc $ 642.2 $ 451.3 $ (2,624.8 ) Diluted net earnings (loss) per ordinary share attributable to Ingersoll-Rand plc ordinary shareholders: Continuing operations $ 2.23 $ 1.47 $ (8.41 ) Discontinued operations (0.34 ) (0.10 ) (0.32 ) Net earnings (loss) $ 1.89 $ 1.37 $ (8.73 ) Net Revenues Net revenues for the year ended December 31, 2010 increased by 7.5%, or $977.3 million, compared with the same period of 2009, which primarily resulted from the following: Volume/product mix 7.4% Pricing 0.2% Currency exchange rates 0.3% Devaluation of Venezuelan Bolivar -0.5% Acquisitions 0.1% Total 7.5% The increase in revenues was primarily driven by higher volumes experienced within the Climate Solutions, Residential Solutions, and Industrial Technologies business segments, as well as favorable foreign currency impacts. However, the devaluation of the Venezuelan Bolivar had a $70.0 million impact on reported revenues during 2010. Net revenues for the year ended December 31, 2009 increased by 0.4%, or $56.8 million, compared with the same period of 2008, which primarily resulted from the following: Volume/product mix -15.1 % Pricing 0.8 % Currency exchange rates -1.4 % Acquisitions 16.1 % Total 0.4 % 31 Table of Contents The acquisition of Trane increased net revenues by $2,096.3 million compared with the same period of 2008. The increase, which contributed 16.1% to the year-over-year change in revenues, was a consequence of 2008 reported results only reflecting activity since the Acquisition Date. Excluding the results of Trane, revenues decreased by $2,039.5 million, which had a 15.7% effect on total company revenues. This decrease resulted from lower volumes and product mix (15%) and an unfavorable currency impact (1%). These reductions were partially offset by improved pricing (1%). The Trane commercial and residential HVAC businesses also experienced substantial volume declines during the year. Cost of Goods Sold For the year ended December 31, 2010, cost of goods sold increased by $616.3 million, or 6.5% compared to the same period in 2009. The increase was primarily due to higher volumes, increases in material and other costs and unfavorable foreign currency impacts. However, these costs were partially offset by productivity actions and restructuring programs implemented during 2009. These actions helped to mitigate the impact of the depressed economic climate in several of our major end markets. As a result, cost of goods sold as a percentage of revenue decreased to 72.1% from 72.8%. In addition, restructuring costs had a 0.2 point and 0.4 point impact on cost of goods sold as a percentage of revenue in 2010 and 2009, respectively. For the year ended December 31, 2009, cost of goods sold decreased by $5.3 million, or 0.1% compared to the same period in 2008, which included the results of Trane since the Acquisition Date. Trane increased cost of goods sold by $1,421.8 million, which contributed 14.8% to the year-over-year change. Excluding the results of Trane, cost of goods sold decreased by $1,427.1 million, which had a 14.9% effect on total company cost of goods sold. This decrease was a result of increased productivity actions and expense reduction across the businesses, and lower volumes due to the continued global weakness in our major end markets. Cost of goods sold as a percentage of revenue decreased to 72.8% from 73.2%. In addition, cost of goods sold included $56.9 million of restructuring costs compared to restructuring and integration costs of $40.0 million in 2008. Selling and Administrative Expenses For the year ended December 31, 2010, selling and administrative expense decreased by $14.2 million, or 0.5% compared to the same period in 2009. The decrease was primarily due to benefits from productivity actions and restructuring programs implemented during 2009. These actions helped to mitigate the impact of the depressed economic climate in several of our major end markets. As a result, selling and administrative expense as a percentage of revenue decreased to 19.0% from 20.5% in 2009. In addition, restructuring costs had a 0.1 point and 0.4 point impact on selling and administrative expense as a percentage of revenue in 2010 and 2009, respectively. For the year ended December 31, 2009, selling and administrative expense increased by $378.4 million, or 16.4% compared to the same period in 2008, which included the results of Trane since the Acquisition Date. Trane increased selling and administrative expenses by $558.5 million, which contributed 24.2% to the year-over-year change. Excluding the results of Trane, selling and administrative expense decreased by $180.1 million, or 7.8% as a result of increased productivity actions and expense reduction across the businesses. As a result of the dramatic decline in volume experienced during 2009 and the resulting reduction in revenue, selling and administrative expense as a percentage of revenue increased to 20.5% compared with 17.7% for the same period of 2008. In addition, selling and administrative expense included $52.7 million of restructuring costs compared to $30.3 million of restructuring and integration costs in 2008. Asset Impairment During the fourth quarter of 2008, we tested goodwill and other indefinite-lived intangible assets for impairment. As a result of decreased global equity valuations, the tightening of industrial and retail end markets and a resulting decline in our 2009 projected financial performance, we incurred a non-cash pre-tax impairment charge of $3,710.0 million, $3,385.0 million after-tax. 32 Table of Contents The following table summarizes the impairment charges that were taken by segment during 2008: In millions Goodwill Intangible Assets Marketable Securities Total Climate Solutions $ 839.8 $ 400.0 $ - $ 1,239.8 Residential Solutions 1,656.2 454.0 - 2,110.2 Security Technologies 344.0 6.0 10.0 360.0 Total $ 2,840.0 $ 860.0 $ 10.0 $ 3,710.0 For a further discussion of impairment-related matters, see Goodwill and Indefinite-Lived Intangible Assets under Critical Accounting Policies and Notes 5, 8 and 9 to the Consolidated Financial Statements. Operating Margin Operating margin for the year ended December 31, 2010 increased to 8.9% from 6.7% for the same period in 2009. The benefit of higher volumes, productivity actions and restructuring programs more than offset the negative effect of increased material and other costs. Also, included in operating income was $45.3 million of charges associated with ongoing restructuring actions compared to $109.6 million recorded in 2009. These costs had a 0.3 point and 0.8 point impact on operating margin in 2010 and 2009, respectively. Operating margin for the year ended December 31, 2009 increased to 6.7% from a negative 19.3% for the same period in 2008, which included the results of Trane since the Acquisition Date. Operating margin for the year ended December 31, 2008 was impacted by a non-cash charge of $3,710.0 million related to an asset impairment recognized in the fourth quarter. Excluding the asset impairment, which had a 28.4 point impact on 2008 operating margins, year-over-year operating margins decreased by 2.4 points. The primary drivers of the decrease related to lower volumes, an unfavorable currency impact and lower margins in the acquired Trane businesses. Results were further impacted by $109.6 million of restructuring costs which impacted operating margins in 2009 by 0.8 points. Productivity actions, expense reduction and improved pricing helped to mitigate the impact of the continued global weakness in our major end markets. Interest Expense Interest expense for the year ended December 31, 2010 decreased $18.4 million compared with the same period of 2009 as a result of lower average debt balances in 2010. Interest expense for the year ended December 31, 2009 increased $58.4 million compared with the same period of 2008. The increase is primarily related to higher average debt levels as a result of the funding of the acquisition of Trane in June 2008. Other, Net The year-over-year changes in Other, net primarily resulted from the following: In millions 2010 2009 2008 Interest income $ 15.2 $ 12.6 $ 95.1 Exchange gain (loss) 0.9 (36.2 ) (41.1 ) Earnings from equity investments 11.5 8.0 3.4 Other 14.7 34.3 6.5 Other, net $ 42.3 $ 18.7 $ 63.9 For the year ended December 31, 2010, Other, net increased by $23.6 million compared with the same period of 2009. The increase was primarily driven by lower currency losses, which partially resulted from a $24 million charge recorded in 2009 associated with the devaluation of the Venezuelan Bolivar. The increase was partially 33 Table of Contents offset by $25 million of income recorded in the fourth quarter of 2009 primarily related to a favorable settlement with an insurance carrier associated with a portion of our asbestos obligation. The settlement is included in Other in the table above. For the year ended December 31, 2009, Other, net decreased by $45.2 million compared with the same period of 2008. The decrease was primarily related to lower interest income as a result of lower average cash balances during the year. The decrease was partially offset by income of approximately $25 million in the fourth quarter of 2009 primarily related to a favorable settlement with an insurance carrier associated with a portion of our asbestos obligation. The settlement is included in Other in the table above. Included in Exchange gain (loss) in 2009 is a $24 million charge associated with the devaluation in the Venezuelan Bolivar. At December 31, 2009, we remeasured our foreign currency receivables and payables associated with the Venezuelan Bolivar at the parallel rate of 6.0 Bolivars for each U.S. dollar. This was based on our inability to settle certain transactions through the official government channels in an expeditious manner. Previously, we remeasured all foreign currency transactions at the official rate of 2.15 Bolivars to the U.S. dollar. Provision for Income Taxes For the year ended December 31, 2010, the effective tax rate was 22.3% compared to 13.5% in 2009. The 2010 tax rate was below the U.S. Statutory rate of 35.0% primarily due to earnings in non-U.S. jurisdictions, which, in aggregate, have a lower effective rate. The 8.8 point increase in the effective rate is primarily the result of a $40.5 million non-cash charge to income tax expense related to the Healthcare Reform Legislation as well as changes in geographical mix of earnings, offset by net changes in our valuation allowances. For the year ended December 31, 2009, the effective tax rate was 13.5% compared to 7.1% in 2008. The 2009 tax rate was below the U.S. Statutory rate of 35.0% primarily due to earnings in non-U.S. jurisdictions, which, in aggregate, have a lower effective rate. The 6.4 point increase in the effective rate is primarily the result of an increase in valuation allowances as well as changes in earnings mix offset by a reduction in our liability for unrecognized tax benefits. See Note 19 to the Consolidated Financial Statements for further discussion of tax matters. Review of Business Segments The segment discussions that follow describe the significant factors contributing to the changes in results for each segment included in continuing operations. Climate Solutions Our Climate Solutions segment delivers energy-efficient refrigeration and Heating, Ventilation and Air Conditioning (HVAC) solutions throughout the world. Encompassing the transport and stationary refrigeration markets as well as the commercial HVAC markets, this segment offers customers a broad range of products, services and solutions to manage controlled temperature environments. This segment includes the market-leading brands of Hussmann, Thermo King and Trane. On October 4, 2010, we completed the divestiture of our European refrigerated display case business, which was sold under the KOXKA brand, to an affiliate of American Industrial Acquisition Corporation (AIAC Group). The business, which was previously reported as part of the Climate Solutions segment, designs, manufactures and markets commercial refrigeration equipment through sales branches and a network of distributors throughout Europe, Africa and the Middle East. KOXKA had two manufacturing facilities in Spain and employed 445 people. Segment information has been revised to exclude the results of this business for all periods presented. 34 Table of Contents Reported results include revenue and operating income from the Trane commercial HVAC business for the six months and 25 days since the acquisition of Trane in 2008 and for the full year in 2009 and 2010. Dollar amounts in millions 2010 % change 2009 % change 2008 Net revenues $ 7,800.8 8.2% $ 7,211.2 9.6% $ 6,582.0 Operating income (loss) 598.2 38.8% 430.9 n/a (726.7 ) * Operating margin 7.7% 6.0% -11.0% * Amount includes a non-cash impairment charge of $1,240 million. 2010 vs 2009 Net revenues for the year ended December 31, 2010 increased by 8.2% or $589.6 million, compared with the same period of 2009, which primarily resulted from the following: Volume/product mix 7.5% Pricing 0.1% Currency exchange rates 0.7% Devaluation of the Venezuelan Bolivar -0.3% Acquisitions 0.2% Total 8.2% Trane commercial HVAC revenues continue to be impacted by declining activity in non-residential construction markets, which has affected our commercial HVAC revenues in all geographic areas, except Asia. Both equipment and systems revenue were impacted by the decrease in end-market activity. However, increased revenue for parts, services and solutions helped to mitigate these declines. Net revenues in our transport and stationary refrigeration businesses experienced strong improvements in all geographic areas due to the refrigerated trailer and truck markets. In addition, sea-going container revenues and worldwide bus revenues have begun to improve due to an increase in end-market activity. Worldwide display cases and contracting revenue also increased due to recovering supermarket capital expenditures. Operating income for the year ended December 31, 2010 increased by 38.8%, or $167.3 million, compared with the same period of 2009. The increase, which improved operating margins to 7.7% from 6.0%, was primarily related to improved productivity actions ($280 million) as well as higher volumes and product mix ($178 million). However, the benefits resulting from these improvements were partially offset by increases in material and other costs ($266 million). Included in 2010 operating income was $23.7 million of charges associated with ongoing restructuring actions, which had a 0.3 point impact on operating margins. The comparable amount recorded in 2009 was $35.9 million, which had a 0.5 point impact on operating margins. 2009 vs 2008 Net revenues for the year ended December 31, 2009 increased by 9.6% or $629.2 million, compared with the same period of 2008, which primarily resulted from the following: Volume/product mix -13.0% Pricing 0.5% Currency exchange rates -1.0% Acquisitions 23.1% Total 9.6% Net revenues in the Trane commercial HVAC business increased $1,522.2 million compared with the same period of 2008. The increase, which represented 23.1% of the segment year-over-year increase, was a consequence of 2008 reported results only reflecting activity since the Acquisition Date. 35 Table of Contents Net revenues in the transport and stationary refrigeration business decreased 28.0%, or $893.0 million, compared with the same period of 2008. The decrease, which had a 13.5% impact on the segment year-over-year results, was primarily due to lower volumes and product mix (13%) and an unfavorable currency impact (1%). These reductions were slightly offset by improved pricing (1%). Trane commercial HVAC revenues were impacted by a continued decline in activity in non-residential construction markets in all major geographic areas, except Asia. Both equipment and service revenue, as well as parts, services and solutions were impacted by the decrease in end-market activity. Net revenues in our transport and stationary refrigeration businesses decreased primarily as a result of the continued decline in the heavy truck market in Europe. However, improved activity in the U.S. and Asian refrigerated trailer and truck markets during the fourth quarter helped to mitigate the declines in Europe. In addition, sea-going container revenues and worldwide bus revenues began to improve in the fourth quarter due to an increase in end market activity. Worldwide display cases and contracting revenue were impacted by continued slower supermarket capital expenditures in both the U.S. and Europe. Operating income for the year ended December 31, 2009 increased by $1,157.6 million, compared with the same period of 2008. This increase was a result of a non-cash charge of $1,240 million recognized in the fourth quarter of 2008 related to the impairment of goodwill and other indefinite-lived intangible assets. Excluding the impairment, which had an 18.8 point impact on 2008 operating margins, year-over-year operating income decreased 16.1% or $82.4 million. Excluding the asset impairment charge of $1,200 million in 2008, operating income in the Trane commercial HVAC business increased $101.7 million compared with the same period in 2008, which only included the results of Trane for the six months and 25 days since the Acquisition Date. This increase had a 19.8% impact to segment operating income. The Trane commercial HVAC business was negatively impacted by a significant reduction in volumes and pricing, which was partially offset by increased productivity and improved material costs. Included in 2009 operating income within the Trane commercial HVAC business was $97.3 million of ongoing purchase accounting charges primarily related to the amortization of intangible assets. In addition, we recorded $26.1 million of restructuring charges in 2009 associated with employee termination benefits and other costs associated with announced restructuring plans. These costs had a combined 1.7 point impact on the segment 2009 operating margins. 2008 comparable amounts were $48.1 million related to ongoing purchase accounting costs and $14.6 million related to severance and other business integration costs. In addition, 2008 operating income included $147.4 million in non-recurring purchase accounting charges associated with the fair value allocation of purchase price to backlog, inventory and in-process research and development costs. These costs had a combined 3.2 point impact on the segment 2008 operating margins. Operating income in our transport and stationary refrigeration business decreased by 50.6%, or $184.1 million, compared with the same period of 2008, excluding the $40 million asset impairment charge in 2008. This decrease, which had a 35.9% impact on segment operating income, resulted from lower volumes and product mix ($297 million) and an unfavorable currency impact. This decrease was partially offset by increased productivity ($116 million) and improved pricing ($34 million). In addition, we recorded $9.8 million and $14.9 million of restructuring charges in 2009 and 2008, respectively, associated with employee termination benefits and other costs associated with announced restructuring plans.

However, improved sales to the replacement market more than offset the effect of the new construction market. Excluding the impact of the devaluation of the Venezuelan Bolivar, revenues in the residential security business increased primarily as a result of improving remodeling markets and an increase in end-market activity in the U.S. new builder channel. Operating income for the year ended December 31, 2010 increased by 47.8%, or $58.7 million, compared with the same period of 2009. The increase, which improved operating margins to 8.6% from 6.1%, was primarily related to improved productivity actions ($97 million) and higher volumes and product mix ($43 million). However, the benefits resulting from these improvements were partially offset by increased material and other costs ($50 million) and unfavorable pricing ($15 million). In addition, the devaluation of the Venezuelan Bolivar negatively impacted year-over-year results by $18.0 million. 2009 vs. 2008 Net revenues for the year ended December 31, 2009 increased by 35.8% or $527.8 million, compared with the same period of 2008, which primarily resulted from the following: Volume/product mix -3.8% Pricing 0.6% Acquisition of Trane residential HVAC business 39.0% Total 35.8% Net revenues in the Trane residential HVAC business increased $574.1 million compared with the same period of 2008. The increase, which represented 39.0% of the segment year-over-year increase, was a consequence of 2008 reported results only reflecting activity since the Acquisition Date. Net revenues for the Trane residential HVAC business for the year ended December 31, 2009 were impacted by lower volumes and reduced pricing. Net revenues in the residential security business decreased by 9.9%, or $46.3 million, compared with the same period of 2008. The decrease, which had a 3.2% impact on the segment year-over-year results, was primarily due to lower volumes and product mix (4%). These reductions were slightly offset by improved pricing (1%). Trane residential HVAC revenues were impacted by continued weakness in the U.S. housing market. However, improved fourth quarter sales to the replacement market helped to mitigate the slower end market activity. Residential security revenues were impacted by lower same store sales at large customers and ongoing weakness 37 Table of Contents in the new homebuilder channel. In the fourth quarter, these declines were more than offset by new product revenues and market share gains. Operating income for the year ended December 31, 2009 increased by $2,159.9 million, compared with the same period of 2008. This increase was a result of a non-cash charge of $2,110 million recognized in the fourth quarter of 2008 related to the impairment of goodwill and other indefinite-lived intangible assets within the Trane residential HVAC business. Excluding the impairment, which had a 143.2 point impact on 2008 operating margins, year-over-year operating income increased by 68.4% or $49.9 million. Excluding the asset impairment charge in 2008, operating income in the Trane residential HVAC business increased $43.1 million compared with the same period in 2008, which included the results of Trane for the six months and 25 days since the Acquisition Date. This increase had a 59.0% impact to segment operating income, excluding impairment. The Trane residential HVAC business was impacted by a reduction in volumes and pricing, which was offset by increased productivity and improved material costs. Included in 2009 operating income for the Trane residential HVAC business was $80.6 million of ongoing purchase accounting charges primarily related to the amortization of intangible assets. In addition, we recorded $7.5 million of restructuring charges in 2009 associated with employee termination benefits and other costs associated with announced restructuring plans. These costs had a combined 4.4 point impact on the segment 2009 operating margins. 2008 comparable amounts were $33.0 million related to ongoing purchase accounting costs and $5.6 million related to severance and other business integration costs. In addition, 2008 operating income included $11.0 million in non-recurring purchase accounting charges associated with the fair value allocation of purchase price to backlog, inventory and in-process research and development costs. These costs had a combined 3.4 point impact on the segment 2008 operating margins. Operating income in our residential security business increased by 11.7%, or $6.8 million, compared with the same period of 2008. This increase, which had a 9.3% impact on segment operating income, resulted from increased productivity ($18 million) and improved pricing ($10 million). This increase was partially offset by lower volumes and product mix ($16 million). In addition, we recorded $1.4 million and $6.3 million of restructuring charges in 2009 and 2008, respectively, associated with employee termination benefits and other costs associated with announced restructuring plans.

U.S. markets increased as the equipment market continues to improve. Club Car revenues increased as a result of improving golf markets. Operating income increased by 73.9% or $131.9 million during 2010. The increase, which improved operating margins to 12.5% from 8.2% was primarily related to improved productivity actions ($104 million), higher volumes and product mix ($91 million), and favorable pricing ($23 million). However, these improvements were partially offset by increased material and other costs ($68 million). Included in 2010 operating income was $17.9 million of charges associated with ongoing restructuring actions, which had a 0.7 point impact on operating margins. The comparable amount recorded in 2009 was $27.1 million, which had a 1.2 point impact on 2009 operating margins. 2009 vs 2008 Net revenues for the year ended December 31, 2009 decreased by 25.8% or $754.5 million, compared with the same period of 2008, which primarily resulted from the following: Volume/product mix -24.5% Pricing 0.5% Currency exchange rates -1.8% Total -25.8% Revenues in the Air and Productivity Solutions business declined in all geographic areas. The decrease in the U.S. was a result of volume declines in major industrial, process and fluid handling end markets as well as lower aftermarket results. Non-U.S. revenues were also impacted by volume declines in industrial activity. Club Car revenues sharply decreased in all geographic areas due to weakening economic fundamentals in key golf, hospitality and recreation markets. In addition, the decline was impacted by customers deferring golf car replacement by extending their leases. Market share gains and growth in low-speed vehicle sales at Club Car helped to offset some of the slow end market activity. Operating income decreased by 50.6% or $182.5 million during 2009. During 2009, we recorded $27.1 million of restructuring charges associated with employee termination benefits and other cost associated with announced restructuring plans, which had a 1.2 point impact on operating margins. The remaining decrease was primarily related to lower volumes and product mix ($263 million), an unfavorable currency impact ($20 million) and higher material costs ($17 million). These reductions were partially offset by increased productivity ($122 million) and improved pricing ($16 million). 39 Table of Contents Security Technologies Our Security Technologies segment is a leading global provider of products and services that make environments safe, secure and productive.

Additionally, on February 17, 2010, we terminated the expanded accounts receivable purchase program prior to its expiration in March 2010. We currently believe that our cash and cash equivalents balance, the cash generated by our operations, our committed credit lines as well as our expected ability to access the capital markets will be sufficient to meet our operating and capital needs for the foreseeable future. Liquidity The following table contains several key measures to gauge our financial condition and liquidity at the period ended December 31: In millions 2010 2009 2008 Cash and cash equivalents $ 1,014.3 $ 876.7 $ 550.2 Short-term borrowings and current maturities of long-term debt 761.6 1,191.7 2,350.4 Long-term debt 2,922.3 2,904.9 2,773.7 Total debt 3,683.9 4,096.6 5,124.1 Total Ingersoll-Rand plc shareholders equity 7,964.3 7,071.8 6,661.4 Total equity 8,059.1 7,175.7 6,762.1 Debt-to-total capital ratio 31.3 % 36.2 % 43.1 % 44 Table of Contents Short-term borrowings and current maturities of long-term debt consisted of the following: In millions 2010 2009 Debentures with put feature $ 343.6 $ 343.6 Exchangeable Senior Notes 328.3 315.0 Current maturities of long-term debt 48.4 526.5 Other short-term borrowings 41.3 6.6 Total $ 761.6 $ 1,191.7 Commercial Paper Program We use borrowings under our commercial paper program for general corporate purposes. As of December 31, 2010 and 2009, we had no amounts outstanding after repaying $998.7 million during 2009. These payments were funded primarily using cash generated from our operations. Debentures with Put Feature At December 31, 2010 and 2009, we had outstanding $343.6 million of fixed rate debentures, which only requires early repayment at the option of the holder. These debentures contain a put feature that the holders may exercise on each anniversary of the issuance date. If exercised, we are obligated to repay in whole or in part, at the holder option, the outstanding principal amount (plus accrued and unpaid interest) of the debentures held by the holder. If these options are not exercised, the final maturity dates would range between 2027 and 2028. In 2010, holders of these debentures chose to exercise the put feature on less than $0.1 million of the outstanding debentures. On February 15, 2011, holders of these debentures had the option to exercise the put feature on $37.2 million of the outstanding debentures. The holders chose not to exercise the put feature at that date. Based on our cash flow forecast, we believe we will have sufficient liquidity to repay any amounts redeemable as a result of these put features. Exchangeable Senior Notes Due 2012 In April 2009, we issued $345 million of 4.5% Exchangeable Senior Notes (the Notes) through our wholly-owned subsidiary, IR-Global. The Notes are fully and unconditionally guaranteed by each of IR-Ireland, IR-Limited and IR-International. Interest on the Notes is paid twice a year in arrears. In addition, holders may exchange their notes at their option prior to November 15, 2011 in accordance with specified circumstances set forth in the indenture agreement or anytime on or after November 15, 2011 through their scheduled maturity in April 2012. Upon any exchange, the Notes will be paid in cash up to the aggregate principal amount of the notes to be exchanged. The remainder due on the option feature, if any, will be paid in cash, ordinary shares or a combination thereof at the option of the Company. The Notes are subject to certain customary covenants, however, none of these covenants are considered restrictive to our operations. We account for the Notes in accordance with GAAP, which requires us to allocate the proceeds between debt and equity, in a manner that reflects our nonconvertible debt borrowing rate. We allocated approximately $305 million of the gross proceeds to debt, with the remaining discount of approximately $40 million (approximately $39 million after allocated fees) recorded within equity. Additionally, we are amortizing the discount into earnings over a three-year period. During the fourth quarter of 2010, the sales price condition set forth in the indenture agreement for the Notes continues to be satisfied. As a result, the Notes may be exchangeable at the holders option during the first quarter of 2011. Therefore, we classified the debt portion of the Notes as short-term in the Consolidated Balance Sheet at December 31, 2010. In addition, we classified the equity portion of the Notes as Temporary equity to reflect the amount that could result in cash settlement at the balance sheet date. 45 Table of Contents Long-Term Debt In August 2008, we filed a universal shelf registration statement with the SEC for an indeterminate amount of securities for future issuance and issued $1.6 billion of long-term debt pursuant to the shelf registration statement through our wholly-owned subsidiary, IR-Global. Approximately $1.4 billion remains outstanding as of December 31, 2010 as the Company repaid $250 million as it became due during 2010. The remaining balance consists of $600 million 6.000% Senior Notes due in 2013 and $750 million 6.875% Senior Notes due in 2018. These notes are fully and unconditionally guaranteed by IR-Limited. The net proceeds from the offering were used to reduce the amount outstanding under the senior unsecured bridge loan facility. Interest on the fixed rate notes will be paid twice a year. We have the option to redeem them in whole or in part at any time, and from time to time, prior to their stated maturity date at redemption prices set forth in the debt offering documents. The notes are subject to certain customary covenants, however, none of these covenants are considered restrictive to our operations. Senior Notes Due 2014 In April 2009, we issued $655 million of 9.5% Senior Notes through our wholly-owned subsidiary, IR-Global. The notes are fully and unconditionally guaranteed by each of IR-Ireland, IR-Limited and IR-International. Interest on the fixed rate notes will be paid twice a year in arrears. We have the option to redeem them in whole or in part at any time, and from time to time, prior to their stated maturity date at redemption prices set forth in the indenture agreement. The notes are subject to certain customary covenants, however, none of these covenants are considered restrictive to our operations. Accounts Receivable Purchase Program On March 31, 2009, we expanded our existing Trane accounts receivable purchase program to encompass originators from all four of our business segments. The increase in originators allowed us to increase the program size from $150 million to $325 million. At December 31, 2009, the outstanding balance of eligible trade receivables sold to the master special purpose vehicle was $544.2 million. However, no net interests were sold to any of the three conduits administered by unaffiliated financial institutions. On February 17, 2010, we terminated the expanded facility prior to its expiration in March 2010. See Note 10 to the Consolidated Financial Statements for a further description of the program. Pension Plans Our investment objectives in managing defined benefit plan assets are to ensure that present and future benefit obligations to all participants and beneficiaries are met as they become due; to provide a total return that, over the long-term, minimizes our required contributions at the appropriate levels of risk; and to meet any statutory or regulatory requirements. We monitor the impact of market conditions on our funding requirements on a quarterly basis. None of our defined benefit pension plans have experienced any significant impact on their liquidity due to the volatility in the markets. For further details on pension plan activity, see Note 13 to the Consolidated Financial Statements. Cash Flows The following table reflects the major categories of cash flows for the years ended December 31, respectively. For additional details, please see the Consolidated Statements of Cash Flows in the Consolidated Financial Statements. In millions 2010 2009 2008 Operating cash flow provided by (used in) continuing operations $ 756.3 $ 1,764.9 $ 423.5 Investing cash flow provided by (used in) continuing operations (179.0 ) (183.1 ) (7,307.0 ) Financing cash flow provided by (used in) continuing operations (403.7 ) (1,208.1 ) 2,760.6 46 Table of Contents Operating Activities Net cash provided by operating activities from continuing operations was $756.3 million for the year ended December 31, 2010 compared with $1,764.9 million in 2009. As a result of the severe economic downturn, positive operating cash flows for 2009 reflected decreased volume levels and our increased focus on working capital management, including improvements in accounts receivable collections and inventory management. While we continued to actively manage working capital in 2010, our operating cash flows reflect increased inventory levels from 2009 as several of our end markets have stabilized and we anticipate improvement in several of our key end markets during 2011. Additionally, during 2010 the Company made discretionary cash contributions to its pension fund of $444 million ($359 million after tax benefit received). Net cash provided by operating activities from continuing operations was $1,764.9 million for the year ended December 31, 2009 compared with $423.5 million in 2008. 2008 operating cash flows were impacted by a tax payment of approximately $700 million in the first quarter of 2008 paid to various taxing authorities primarily associated with the Compact Equipment divestiture. Cash flows from operating activities for the year ended December 31, 2009 include significant improvements in accounts receivable collections and inventory management, in addition to the results of Trane for the entire period. Investing Activities Net cash used in investing activities from continuing operations was $179.0 million for the year ended December 31, 2010 compared with $183.1 million in 2009. The change in investing activities is primarily attributable to a reduction in capital expenditures during 2010. Net cash used in investing activities from continuing operations was $183.1 million for the year ended December 31, 2009 compared with $7,307.0 million in 2008. The change is primarily attributable to cash used for the acquisition of Trane in 2008. Financing Activities Net cash used in financing activities during the year ended December 31, 2010 was $403.7 million, compared with $1,208.1 million during 2009. The change in financing activities is primarily related to less debt repayments in 2010, additional stock options exercised and a reduction of the quarterly stock dividend. Net cash used in financing activities from continuing operations was $1,208.1 million for the year ended December 31, 2009 compared with $2,760.6 million of net cash provided by financing activities during 2008. The change in financing activities is primarily related to the proceeds received from the bridge loan facility and commercial paper used to finance the acquisition of Trane in June 2008. During the year ended December 31, 2009, we refinanced the bridge loan facility and repaid the amounts outstanding on our commercial paper program. Capital Resources Based on historical performance and current expectations, we believe our cash and cash equivalents balance, the cash generated from our operations, our committed credit lines and our expected ability to access capital markets will satisfy our working capital needs, capital expenditures and other liquidity requirements associated with our operations for the foreseeable future. Capital expenditures were $179.5 million, $204.1 million and $305.0 million for 2010, 2009 and 2008, respectively. Our investments continue to improve manufacturing productivity, reduce costs and provide environmental enhancements and advanced technologies for existing facilities. The capital expenditure program for 2011 is estimated to be approximately $250 million, including amounts approved in prior periods. Many of these projects are subject to review and cancellation at our option without incurring substantial charges. We announced plans to initiate enterprise-wide restructuring actions in October 2008. These actions included streamlining the footprint of manufacturing facilities and reducing the general and administrative cost base. During 2009, we incurred approximately $109.6 million of costs associated with this restructuring program. During 2010, we incurred costs of $45.3 million associated with ongoing restructuring actions. 47 Table of Contents For financial market risk impacting the Company, see Item 7A. Quantitative and Qualitative Disclosure About Market Risk. Capitalization In addition to cash on hand and operating cash flow, we maintain significant credit availability under our commercial paper programs. Our ability to borrow at a cost-effective rate under the commercial paper programs is contingent upon maintaining an investment-grade credit rating. As of December 31, 2010, our credit ratings were as follows: Short-term Long-term Moody P-2 Baa1 Standard and Poor A-2 BBB+ The credit ratings set forth above are not a recommendation to buy, sell or hold securities and may be subject to revision or withdrawal by the assigning rating organization. Each rating should be evaluated independently of any other rating. On May 26, 2010, we entered into a 3-year, $1.0 billion Senior Unsecured Revolving Credit Facility through our wholly-owned subsidiary, IR-Global. This new facility replaced our pre-existing $1.25 billion, 5-year revolving credit facility that was scheduled to mature on August 12, 2010. At December 31, 2010, our committed revolving credit facilities totaled $2.0 billion, of which $1.0 billion expires in June 2011 and $1.0 billion expires in May 2013. These lines are unused and provide support for our commercial paper program as well as for other general corporate purposes. Other available non-U.S. lines of credit were $699.2 million, of which $524.7 million were unused at December 31, 2010. These lines provide support for bank guarantees, letters of credit and other general corporate purposes. Our public debt does not contain any financial covenants and our revolving credit lines have a debt-to-total capital covenant of 65%. As of December 31, 2010, our debt-to-total capital ratio was significantly beneath this limit. Guarantees As part of the reorganization of IR-New Jersey in 2001, IR-Limited fully and unconditionally guaranteed all of the issued public debt securities of IR-New Jersey. IR- New Jersey unconditionally guaranteed payment of the principal, premium, if any, and interest on IR-Limited 4.75% Senior Notes due in 2015 in aggregate principal amount of $300 million. The guarantee is unsecured and provided on an unsubordinated basis. The guarantee ranks equally in right of payment with all of the existing and future unsecured and unsubordinated debt of IR-New Jersey. In addition, public debt securities issued by IR-Global are fully and unconditionally guaranteed by IR-Limited. As a part of the reorganization of IR-Limited in 2009, the guarantee structure was updated to reflect the newly created legal structure under which (i) IR-International assumed the obligations of IR-Limited as issuer or guarantor, as the case may be, and (ii) IR-Ireland and IR-Limited fully and unconditionally guaranteed the obligations under the various indentures covering the currently outstanding public debt of IR-International, IR-Global and IR-New Jersey. Neither IR-Ireland nor IR-Limited has issued or intends to issue guarantees in respect of any public indebtedness incurred by Trane. 48 Table of Contents Contractual Obligations The following table summarizes our contractual cash obligations by required payment periods, in millions: Less than 1 year 1 - 3 years 3 - 5 years More than 5 years Total Short-term debt $ 41.3 $ - $ - $ - $ 41.3 Long-term debt 737.0 * 654.4 1,168.4 1,101.3 3,661.1 Interest payments on long-term debt 246.2 460.2 269.7 603.3 1,579.4 Purchase obligations 885.2 18.6 - - 903.8 Operating leases 157.2 214.5 131.2 102.8 605.7 Total contractual cash obligations $ 2,066.9 $ 1,347.7 $ 1,569.3 $ 1,807.4 $ 6,791.3 * Includes $343.6 million of debt redeemable at the option of the holder. The scheduled maturities of these bonds range between 2027 and 2028. Also includes $345 million related to the Exchangeable Senior Notes due in 2012. See Note 11 to the Consolidated Financial Statements for additional information. Future expected obligations under our pension and postretirement benefit plans, income taxes, environmental and asbestos-related matters have not been included in the contractual cash obligations table above. Pensions At December 31, 2010, we had net obligations of $550.9 million, which consist of noncurrent pension assets of $5.1 million and current and non-current pension benefit liabilities of $556 million. It is our objective to contribute to the pension plans to ensure adequate funds are available in the plans to make benefit payments to plan participants and beneficiaries when required. We currently project that we will contribute approximately $51.2 million to our plans worldwide in 2011. Because the timing and amounts of long-term funding requirements for pension obligations are uncertain, they have been excluded from the preceding table. See Note 13 to the Consolidated Financial Statements for additional information. Postretirement Benefits Other than Pensions At December 31, 2010, we had postretirement benefit obligations of $883 million. We fund postretirement benefit costs principally on a pay-as-you-go basis as medical costs are incurred by covered retiree populations. Benefit payments, which are net of expected plan participant contributions and Medicare Part D subsidy, are expected to be approximately $76.8 million in 2011. Because the timing and amounts of long-term funding requirements for postretirement obligations are uncertain, they have been excluded from the preceding table. See Note 13 to the Consolidated Financial Statements for additional information. Income Taxes At December 31, 2010, we have total unrecognized tax benefits for uncertain tax positions of $534.1 million and $100.4 million of related accrued interest and penalties. The liability has been excluded from the preceding table as we are unable to reasonably estimate the amount and period in which these liabilities might be paid. See Note 19 to the Consolidated Financial Statements for additional information regarding matters relating to income taxes, including unrecognized tax benefits and Internal Revenue Service (IRS) tax disputes. Environmental and Asbestos Matters We are involved in various litigations, claims and administrative proceedings, including those related to environmental, asbestos-related, and product liability matters. We believe that these liabilities are subject to the uncertainties inherent in estimating future costs for contingent liabilities, and will likely be resolved over an extended period of time. Because the timing and amounts of potential future cash flows are uncertain, they have been excluded from the preceding table. See Note 22 to the Consolidated Financial Statements for additional information. See Note 11 and Note 22 for additional information on matters affecting our liquidity. 49 Table of Contents Critical Accounting Policies Management Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations are based upon our Consolidated Financial Statements, which have been prepared in accordance with accounting principles generally accepted in the United States. The preparation of financial statements in conformity with those accounting principles requires management to use judgment in making estimates and assumptions based on the relevant information available at the end of each period. These estimates and assumptions have a significant effect on reported amounts of assets and liabilities, revenue and expenses as well as the disclosure of contingent assets and liabilities because they result primarily from the need to make estimates and assumptions on matters that are inherently uncertain. Actual results may differ from estimates. The following is a summary of certain accounting estimates and assumptions made by management that we consider critical. Allowance for doubtful accounts The Company has provided an allowance for doubtful accounts receivable which represents the best estimate of probable loss inherent in the Company accounts receivable portfolio. This estimate is based upon the Company policy, derived from its knowledge of its end markets, customer base and products. Goodwill and indefinite-lived intangible assets We have significant goodwill and indefinite-lived intangible assets on our balance sheet related to acquisitions. Our goodwill and other indefinite-lived intangible assets are tested and reviewed annually during the fourth quarter for impairment or when there is a significant change in events or circumstances that indicate that the fair value of an asset may be less than the carrying amount of the asset. Recoverability of goodwill is measured at the reporting unit level and determined using a two step process. The first step compares the carrying amount of the reporting unit to its estimated fair value. If the estimated fair value of a reporting unit exceeds its carrying amount, goodwill of the reporting unit is not impaired and the second step of the impairment test is not necessary. To the extent that the carrying value of the reporting unit exceeds its estimated fair value, a second step is performed, wherein the reporting unit carrying value of goodwill is compared to the implied fair value of goodwill. To the extent that the carrying value exceeds the implied fair value, impairment exists and must be recognized. As quoted market prices are not available for our reporting units, the calculation of their estimated fair value in step one is based on two valuation techniques, a discounted cash flow model (income approach) and a market adjusted multiple of earnings and revenues (market approach), with each method being equally weighted in the calculation. In step 2, the implied fair value of goodwill is determined in the same manner as the amount of goodwill recognized in a business combination. The estimated fair value of the reporting unit is allocated to all of the assets and liabilities of the reporting unit (including any unrecognized intangible assets) as if the reporting unit had been acquired in a business combination and the fair value of the reporting unit, as determined in the first step of the goodwill impairment test, was the price paid to acquire that reporting unit. Recoverability of other intangible assets with indefinite useful lives is measured by a comparison of the carrying amount of the intangible assets to the estimated fair value of the respective intangible assets. Any excess of the carrying value over the estimated fair value is recognized as an impairment loss equal to that excess. The calculation of estimated fair value is determined on a relief from royalty methodology (income approach) which is based on the implied royalty paid, at an appropriate discount rate, to license the use of an asset rather than owning the asset. The present value of the after-tax cost savings (i.e. royalty relief) indicates the estimated fair value of the asset. The determination of estimated fair value and the implied fair value of goodwill requires management to make assumptions about estimated cash flows, including profit margins, long-term forecasts, discount rates and terminal growth rates. Management developed these assumptions based on the market and geographic risks unique to each reporting unit. 50 Table of Contents 2010 Impairment Test For our annual impairment testing during the fourth quarter of 2010, we determined that the fair value of the reporting units and indefinite-lived intangible assets exceeded their respective carrying values. The estimates of fair value are based on the best information available as of the date of the assessment, which primarily incorporates management assumptions about expected future cash flows. Under the income approach, we assumed a forecasted cash flow period of five years with discount rates generally ranging from 11.5% to 18% and terminal growth rates generally ranging from 2.5% to 4%. Under the market approach, management used an adjusted multiple of earnings and revenues based on the market information of comparable companies. Additionally, management compared the estimated aggregate fair value of its reporting units to the Company overall market capitalization. For all reporting units except three, the excess of the estimated fair value over carrying value (expressed as a percentage of carrying value) was a minimum of 15%. The three reporting units with a percentage of carrying value less than 15%, reported within the Climate Solutions segment, exceeded their carrying value by 4.4%, 9.4%, and 10.8%. These reporting units have goodwill of approximately $243 million, $1,075 million, and $561 million, respectively. A significant increase in the discount rate, decrease in the long-term growth rate, or substantial reductions in our end markets and volume assumptions could have a negative impact on the estimated fair value of these reporting units. 2009 Impairment Test For our annual impairment testing during the fourth quarter of 2009, we determined that the fair value of the reporting units and indefinite-lived intangible assets exceeded their respective carrying values. The estimates of fair value are based on the best information available as of the date of the assessment, which primarily incorporates management assumptions about expected future cash flows. Under the income approach, we assumed a forecasted cash flow period of five years with discount rates generally ranging from 11% to 15% and terminal growth rates generally ranging from 2% to 5%. Under the market approach, management used an adjusted multiple of earnings and revenues based on the market information of comparable companies. Additionally, management compared the estimated aggregate fair value of its reporting units to the Company overall market capitalization. For all reporting units except one, the excess of the estimated fair value over carrying value (expressed as a percentage of carrying value) was a minimum of 15%. The one reporting unit with a percentage of carrying value less than 15%, reported within the Climate Solutions segment, exceeded its carrying value by 8%. This reporting unit had goodwill of approximately $840 million. A significant increase in the discount rate, decrease in the long-term growth rate, or substantial reductions in our end markets and volume assumptions could have a negative impact on the estimated fair value of the reporting unit. Long-lived assets and finite-lived intangibles Long-lived assets and finite-lived intangibles are reviewed for impairment whenever events or changes in business circumstances indicate that the carrying amount of an asset may not be fully recoverable. Assets are grouped with other assets and liabilities at the lowest level for which identifiable cash flows can be generated. Impairment in the carrying value of an asset would be recognized whenever anticipated future undiscounted cash flows from an asset are less than its carrying value. The impairment is measured as the amount by which the carrying value exceeds the fair value of the asset as determined by an estimate of discounted cash flows. The Company believes that its use of estimates and assumptions are reasonable and comply with generally accepted accounting principles. Changes in business conditions could potentially require future adjustments to these valuations. Loss contingencies Liabilities are recorded for various contingencies arising in the normal course of business, including litigation and administrative proceedings, environmental and asbestos matters and product liability, product warranty, worker compensation and other claims. The Company has recorded reserves in the financial statements related to these matters, which are developed using input derived from 51 Table of Contents actuarial estimates and historical and anticipated experience data depending on the nature of the reserve, and in certain instances with consultation of legal counsel, internal and external consultants and engineers. Subject to the uncertainties inherent in estimating future costs for these types of liabilities, the Company believes its estimated reserves are reasonable and does not believe the final determination of the liabilities with respect to these matters would have a material effect on the financial condition, results of operations, liquidity or cash flows of the Company for any year. Asbestos matters Certain of our wholly-owned subsidiaries are named as defendants in asbestos-related lawsuits in state and federal courts. The Company records a liability for its actual and anticipated future claims as well as an asset for anticipated insurance settlements. Although the Company was neither a manufacturer nor producer of asbestos, some of its formerly manufactured components from third party suppliers utilized asbestos-related components. As a result, the Company records certain income and expenses associated with our asbestos liabilities and corresponding insurance recoveries within discontinued operations, net of tax, as they relate to previously divested businesses. Income and expenses associated with Trane asbestos liabilities and corresponding insurance recoveries are recorded within continuing operations. Refer to Note 22 to the Consolidated Financial Statements for further details of asbestos-related matters. Revenue recognition Revenue is recognized and earned when all of the following criteria are satisfied: (a) persuasive evidence of a sales arrangement exists; (b) price is fixed or determinable; (c) collectability is reasonably assured; and (d) delivery has occurred or service has been rendered. Delivery generally occurs when the title and the risks and rewards of ownership have substantially transferred to the customer. Revenue from maintenance contracts or extended warranties is recognized on a straight-line basis over the life of the contract, unless another method is more representative of the costs incurred. The Company enters into agreements that contain multiple elements, such as equipment, installation and service revenue. For multiple-element arrangements, the revenue relating to undelivered elements is deferred until delivery of the deferred elements. The Company recognizes revenue for delivered elements when the delivered item has stand-alone value to the customer, customer acceptance has occurred, and there are only customary refund or return rights related to the delivered elements. Revenues from certain of our equipment and the related installation sold under construction-type contracts are recorded using the percentage-of-completion method in accordance with GAAP. Income taxes Deferred tax assets and liabilities are determined based on temporary differences between financial reporting and tax bases of assets and liabilities, applying enacted tax rates expected to be in effect for the year in which the differences are expected to reverse. The Company recognizes future tax benefits, such as net operating losses and non-U.S. tax credits, to the extent that realizing these benefits is considered in its judgment to be more likely than not. The Company regularly reviews the recoverability of its deferred tax assets considering its historic profitability, projected future taxable income, timing of the reversals of existing temporary differences and the feasibility of its tax planning strategies. Where appropriate, the Company records a valuation allowance with respect to a future tax benefit. The provision for income taxes involves a significant amount of management judgment regarding interpretation of relevant facts and laws in the jurisdictions in which the Company operates. Future changes in applicable laws, projected levels of taxable income, and tax planning could change the effective tax rate and tax balances recorded by the Company. In addition, tax authorities periodically review income tax returns filed by the Company and can raise issues regarding its filing positions, timing and amount of income or deductions, and the allocation of income among the jurisdictions in which the Company operates. A significant period of time may elapse between the filing of an income tax return and the ultimate resolution of an issue raised by a revenue authority with respect to that return. The Company believes that it has adequately provided for any reasonably foreseeable resolution of these matters. The Company will adjust its estimate if significant events so dictate. To the extent that the ultimate results differ from the original or adjusted estimates of the Company, the effect will be recorded in the provision for income taxes in the period that the matter is finally resolved. 52 Table of Contents Employee benefit plans The Company provides a range of benefits to eligible employees and retired employees, including pensions, postretirement and postemployment benefits. Determining the cost associated with such benefits is dependent on various actuarial assumptions including discount rates, expected return on plan assets, compensation increases, employee mortality, turnover rates and healthcare cost trend rates. Actuarial valuations are performed to determine expense in accordance with generally accepted accounting principles in the United States. Actual results may differ from the actuarial assumptions and are generally accumulated and amortized into earnings over future periods. The Company reviews its actuarial assumptions at each measurement date and makes modifications to the assumptions based on current rates and trends, if appropriate. The discount rate, the rate of compensation increase and the expected long-term rates of return on plan assets are determined as of each measurement date. A discount rate reflects a rate at which pension benefits could be effectively settled. For U.S. plans, the discount rates are established primarily based on bond studies using the Citigroup Pension Liability index. Beginning with the 2010 year-end remeasurement, the discount rates for non-U.S. plans are established using hypothetical yield curves based on yields of corporate bonds rated AA quality. Spot rates are developed from the yield curve and used to discount future benefit payments. Previously for non-U.S. plans, the discount rates were based upon a review of the current yields reported on AA corporate bonds or the yields of high-quality fixed-income investments available and expected to be available during the life of the plans. The rate of compensation increase is dependent on expected future compensation levels. The expected long-term rate of return on plan assets reflects the average rate of returns expected on the funds invested or to be invested to provide for the benefits included in the projected benefit obligation. The expected long-term rate of return on plan assets is based on what is achievable given the plan investment policy, the types of assets held and the target asset allocation. The expected long-term rate of return is determined as of each measurement date. The Company believes that the assumptions utilized in recording its obligations under its plans are reasonable based on input from its actuaries, outside investment advisors and information as to assumptions used by plan sponsors. Changes in any of the assumptions can have an impact on the net periodic pension cost or postretirement benefit cost. Estimated sensitivities to the expected 2011 net periodic pension cost of a 0.25% rate decline in the two basic assumptions are as follows: the discount rate would increase expense by approximately $10.2 million and the estimated return on assets assumption would increase expense by approximately $7.8 million. A 0.25% rate decrease in the discount rate for postretirement benefits would increase expected 2011 net periodic postretirement benefit cost by $0.8 million and a 1.0% increase in the healthcare cost trend rate would increase the cost by approximately $1.9 million. The preparation of financial statements includes the use of estimates and assumptions that affect a number of amounts included in the Company Consolidated Financial Statements. If actual amounts are ultimately different from previous estimates, the revisions are included in the Company results for the period in which the actual amounts become known. Historically, the aggregate differences, if any, between the Company estimates and actual amounts in any year have not had a material impact on the Consolidated Financial Statements. Recently Adopted Accounting Pronouncements: FASB ASC 715, Compensation Retirement Benefits, (ASC 715) requires an entity to measure its defined benefit plan assets and benefit obligations as of the date of the employer fiscal year-end statement of financial position. The measurement date provisions of ASC 715 were effective for the Company for the fiscal year ending December 31, 2008. The Company adopted the measurement provisions of ASC 715, which resulted in an after-tax charge to Retained earnings in the amount of $3.7 million ($6.5 million pre-tax) in 2008. Plans acquired during 2008 were not impacted by this change. In September 2006, the FASB issued revised guidance within FASB ASC 820, Fair Value Measurements and Disclosures (ASC 820) to provide a framework for measuring fair value that is based on the assumptions market participants would use when pricing an asset or liability. ASC 820 also establishes a fair value hierarchy that prioritizes the information to develop those assumptions. Additionally, the guidance expands the disclosures about fair value measurements to include disclosing the fair value measurements of assets or liabilities within 53 Table of Contents each level of the fair value hierarchy. These provisions of ASC 820 were effective for the Company starting on January 1, 2008, with the exception of non-financial assets and liabilities not measured at fair value on a recurring basis, which became effective January 1, 2009. Refer to Note 14 to the Consolidated Financial Statements for a full discussion of these provisions of ASC 820. In February 2007, the FASB issued revised guidance within FASB ASC 825, Financial Instruments (ASC 825) which allows companies the option, at specified election dates, to measure financial assets and liabilities at their current fair value, with the corresponding changes in fair value from period to period recognized in the income statement. Additionally, ASC 825 establishes presentation and disclosure requirements designed to facilitate comparisons between companies that choose different measurement attributes for similar assets and liabilities. These provisions of ASC 825 were effective for the Company starting on January 1, 2008. The Company has not elected this option available under ASC 825. In December 2007, the FASB issued revised guidance to address the financial accounting and reporting for business combinations, which can be found in FASB ASC 805, Business Combinations (ASC 805). ASC 805 supersedes SFAS 141, Business Combinations and retains the fundamental requirements set forth therein regarding the purchase method of accounting. However, it expands the guidance to enable proper recognition and measurement, at fair value, the identifiable assets acquired, liabilities assumed and any noncontrolling interest in the acquired business. In addition, ASC 805 introduces new accounting guidance on how to recognize and measure contingent consideration, contingencies, acquisition and restructuring costs. These provisions of ASC 805 were effective for acquisitions occurring after January 1, 2009. In December 2007, the FASB issued revised guidance within FASB ASC 810, Consolidations (ASC 810) which clarifies that a noncontrolling interest in a subsidiary represents an ownership interest that should be reported as a separate component of Equity in the Consolidated Financial Statements. In addition, ASC 810 requires expanded income statement presentation and disclosures that clearly identify and distinguish between the interests of the Company and the interests of the non-controlling owners of the subsidiary. ASC 810, as it relates to noncontrolling interests, was effective for the Company starting on January 1, 2009. In March 2008, the FASB issued revised guidance within FASB ASC 815, Derivatives and Hedging (ASC 815) which amends and expands the disclosures previously required. ASC 815 requires qualitative disclosures about objectives and strategies for using derivatives, quantitative disclosures about fair value amounts of gains and losses on derivative instruments and disclosures about credit-risk-related contingent features in derivative agreements. The expanded disclosure requirements found in ASC 815 as they relate to the modifications made in March 2008 were effective for the Company starting on January 1, 2009. See Note 12 to the Consolidated Financial Statements for these expanded disclosures. In May 2008, the FASB issued revised guidance within FASB ASC 470, Debt (ASC 470) which requires us to allocate between debt and equity the proceeds of the Company exchangeable notes, in a manner that reflects the Company nonconvertible debt borrowing rate. In addition, the Company is required to amortize any discount into earnings over the term of the notes. These provisions of ASC 470 became applicable to the Company during the second quarter of 2009, upon issuance of the Exchangeable Senior Notes in April 2009. In June 2009, the FASB issued revised guidance within ASC 810. These revisions eliminate FASB Interpretation 46(R) exceptions to consolidating qualifying special purpose entities, contain new criteria for determining the primary beneficiary, and increase the frequency of required reassessments to determine whether a company is the primary beneficiary of a variable interest entity. ASC 810 also contains a new requirement that any term, transaction, or arrangement that does not have a substantive effect on an entity status as a variable interest entity, a company power over a variable interest entity, or a company obligation to absorb losses or its right to receive benefits of an entity must be disregarded in applying FASB Interpretation 46(R) provisions. The elimination of the qualifying special purpose entity concept and its consolidation exceptions means more entities will be subject to consolidation assessments and reassessments. These provisions of ASC 810 were effective as of the beginning of the first fiscal year beginning after November 15, 2009, and for interim periods within that 54 Table of Contents first period, with earlier adoption prohibited. The provisions of ASC 810 did not have a material impact on the Company Consolidated Financial Statements. In June 2009, the FASB issued revised guidance within FASB ASC 860, Transfers and Servicing (ASC 860). These revisions eliminate the concept of a qualifying special purpose entity, create more stringent conditions for reporting a transfer of a portion of a financial asset as a sale, clarify other sale-accounting criteria, and change the initial measurement of a transferor interest in transferred financial assets. These provisions of ASC 860 were effective for transfers of financial assets in fiscal years beginning after November 15, 2009 and in interim periods within those fiscal years with earlier adoption prohibited. The provisions of ASC 860 did not have a material impact on the Company Consolidated Financial Statements. In January 2010, the FASB issued revised guidance within FASB ASC 820, Fair Value Measurements and Disclosures (ASC 820). The revisions require interim disclosures regarding the amounts and reasons for significant transfers in and out of Level 1 and Level 2 fair value measurements, as well as disclosures for each class of assets and liabilities and about the inputs and valuation techniques used to measure fair value for both recurring and non-recurring fair value measurements. These disclosures are required for fair value measurements that fall in either Level 2 or Level 3. Additionally, the revision also requires separate presentation of Level 3 activity for the fair value measurements, using significant unobservable inputs. These revisions were effective as of January 1, 2010, with the exception of the separate presentation of Level 3 activity, which is not effective until fiscal years beginning after December 15, 2010 and for interim periods within those fiscal years. See Note 14 to the Consolidated Financial Statements for these additional disclosures. In July 2010, the FASB issued ASU 2010-20 which revised guidance within ASC 310, Receivables (ASC 310). These revisions include additional disclosures regarding the credit quality of financing receivables to aid financial statement users in their appraisal of credit risk exposure and the adequacy of the allowance for credit losses. The new disclosure requirements were effective for the Company as of December 31, 2010, and new disclosures regarding reporting period activity are effective for interim and annual periods thereafter. The provisions of ASU 2010-20 did not have a material impact on the Company Consolidated Financial Statements.
