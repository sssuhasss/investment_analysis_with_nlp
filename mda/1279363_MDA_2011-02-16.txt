Item 7. Management Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations. The following discussion and analysis of our financial condition and results of operations should be read in conjunction with Part II, Item 6 Selected Financial Data and our combined and consolidated financial statements and related notes appearing elsewhere in this 2010 Form 10-K. The following discussion contains forward-looking statements that involve risks, uncertainties and assumptions that could cause our actual results to differ materially from management expectations. Factors that could cause such differences include those set forth under Part I, Item 1 Business and Part I, Item 1A Risk Factors , as well as Forward-Looking Statements discussed earlier in this 2010 Form 10-K. Overview Executive Summary We are committed to operating our business in a manner that serves our key constituents members, providers, government clients and associates while delivering competitive returns for our investors. We provide managed care services exclusively to government-sponsored health care programs, serving approximately 2.2 million members as of December 31, 2010. We believe that our broad range of experience and exclusive government focus allows us to effectively serve our members, partner with our providers and government clients and efficiently manage our ongoing operations. Our strategic priorities include improving health care quality and access for our members, achieving a competitive cost position and delivering prudent and profitable growth. For a complete discussion of our progress relating to our strategic business initiatives, see Part I, Item 1 Business Business Strategy . General Economic and Political Environment The current economic and political environment is affecting our business and the industry overall in a number of ways, as more fully described throughout this 2010 Form 10-K. New governors recently took office in nearly all of our current Medicaid markets. These new administrations may propose and implement significant changes to current Medicaid programs in their respective states. These changes may include moving programs into managed care, such as the ABD populations; expanding existing programs to provide coverage to those who are currently uninsured; and reprocurement of existing managed care programs. State budget shortfalls in many states will be a significant consideration in any changes to existing Medicaid programs. The Georgia Department of Community Health is evaluating its Medicaid programs beyond July 1, 2012, which may include a re-bid of the programs for new contracts effective July 1, 2012. Louisiana and Texas, states in which we have offered MA plans for several years, are now contemplating new and expanded Medicaid managed care programs that would be very complementary to our existing operations and infrastructure. Premium Rates and Payments The states in which we operate continue to experience fiscal challenges which have led to budget cuts and reductions in Medicaid premiums in certain states or rate increases that are below medical cost trends. In particular, we continue to experience pressure on rates in Florida and Georgia, two states from which we derive a substantial portion of our revenue. Although premiums are generally contractually payable to us before or during the month in which we are obligated to provide services to our members, we have experienced delays in premium payments from certain states. In particular, the State of Georgia recently passed legislation mandating that payment for Medicaid premiums in that state be made in the middle and at the end of the month i n which services are provided. Although this legislation becomes effective in June 2011, the State of Georgia has already implemented this change. Previously, such payments were made at the beginning of each month. Given the budget shortfalls in many states with which we contract, additional payment delays may occur in the future. 45 Table of Contents In 2009, as part of the federal medical assistance percentages ( FMAP ), Congress temporarily increased federal funding for state Medicaid programs. The policy rationale was to help alleviate states fiscal problems in the face of declining revenues and rising Medicaid enrollments due to the economic downturn. The enhanced FMAP was set to expire at the end of 2010. The Senate and House of Representatives have separately passed legislation extending additional enhanced FMAP funding through June 2011. If the enhanced FMAP is not extended beyond June 2011, states may have to reassess the level of benefits provided under their health care programs, reassess eligibility for benefits and/or take other actions to address a lower FMAP. Health Care Reform We believe that the new health care reform legislation will bring about significant changes to the American health care system. For a further discussion of health care reform and its potential impact on our business, see Part I, Item 1 Business Health Care Reform . In addition, refer to the risks and uncertainties related to health care reform as discusses in Part I, Item 1A Risk Factors Future changes in health care law present challenges for our business that could have a material adverse effect on our results of operations and cash flows. Business and Financial Outlook Business Trends Our revenues and medical benefits expenses for fiscal year 2010 were lower than in prior periods due to our exit on December 31, 2009 from our MA PFFS product and our exit from Medicaid programs in certain Florida counties during 2009. Premium revenue from our PFFS product represented approximately 41% of our MA reportable operating segment revenue and 17% of our consolidated premium revenue for the 2009 fiscal year. We anticipate that the withdrawal from the PFFS product may provide approximately $40.0 million to $60.0 million of excess capital in the insurance companies that underwrote this line of business, which we may be able to distribute to our unregulated subsidiaries through dividends. However , we currently believe we will not have the benefit of these dividends until late 2011 and possibly later, if at all. Any dividend of surplus capital of our applicable insurance subsidiaries, including the timing and amount of any dividend, would be subject to a variety of factors, which could materially change the aforementioned timing and amount. Those factors principally include the financial performance of other lines of business that operate in those insurance subsidiaries, approval from regulatory agencies and potential changes in regulatory capital requirements. During 2009, CMS imposed a marketing sanction against us that prohibited us from the marketing of, and enrolling members into, all lines of our Medicare business from March until the sanction was released in November of that year. As a result of the sanction, we were not eligible to receive auto-assignment of LIS dual-eligible beneficiaries into our PDPs for January 2010 enrollment. We received auto-assignment of such members in subsequent months, although such assignments were at levels well below the level we typically experience in the month of January. We received rate increases in most of our Medicaid markets during the third quarter of 2010, including net increases of approximately 2.5% to 3.0% in Florida effective September 1, 2010 and 1.5% to 2.0% in Georgia effective July 1, 2010, that were below our medical cost trends. Hawaii program rate increases, which we believe have improved the stability of the program, also were effective July 1, 2010. New York program rate increases were also implemented during the third quarter of 2010 that were effective April 1, 2010. As part of the 2010 Acts, MA payment benchmarks for 2011 were frozen at 2010 levels. This places increased importance on administrative cost improvements and effective medical cost initiatives. Based on the outcome of our 2011 PDP bids, which resulted in our plans being below the benchmarks in 20 of the 34 CMS regions, up from 19 regions in 2010, we were eligible for auto-assignment of LIS beneficiaries in those 20 regions for January 2011 enrollment. In addition, we maintained our auto-assigned members in eight other CMS regions where we bid within a de minimis range of the benchmark. Some hospital contracts are directly tied to state Medicaid fee schedules, in which case reimbursement levels may be adjusted up or down, generally on a prospective basis, based on adjustments made by the state to the fee schedule. We have experienced, and may continue to experience, such adjustments unless such adjustments are mitigated by an increase in premiums, our profitability will be negatively impacted. 46 Table of Contents Strategic and Organizational Restructuring In August 2010, we announced a strategic and organizational restructuring with the objective of ensuring administrative efficiency and a competitive cost structure. The restructuring included a workforce reduction and the elimination of a significant number of open positions resulting from streamlining and improving business processes and operations, including the centralization and consolidation of certain functions. We also allocated new resources and directed substantial investments to priority areas such as health care quality, compliance, information technology, and business development. Assessment of opportunities to improve the efficiency and effectiveness of our administrative processes remains an important discipline for us. We continue to evaluate our operations in order to achieve our long-term target of an administrative expense ratio in the low 10% range. In addition, as part of our medical cost initiatives, we have implemented provider contracting, case and disease management and pharmacy initiatives. These medical cost initiatives contributed to the year-over-year reductions we achieved for our medical benefits ratios. Financial Impact of Government Investigations and Litigation For a complete discussion of government investigations and litigation including the associated financial impact, please refer to our Selling, general and administrative expense discussion under Results of Operations below and Part IV, Item 15(a) Note 11 Commitments and Contingencies . Basis of Presentation Segments Reportable operating segments are defined as components of an enterprise for which discrete financial information is available and evaluated on a regular basis by the chief operating decision-maker to determine how resources should be allocated to an individual segment and to assess performance of those segments. Previously, we reported two operating segments, Medicaid and Medicare, which coincide with our two main business lines. During the first quarter of 2010, we reassessed our segment reporting practices and made revisions to reflect our current method of managing performance and determining resource allocation, which includes reviewing the results of our PDP operations separately from other Medicare products. Accordingly, we now have three reportable segments within our two main business lines: Medicaid, MA and PDP. The PFFS pro duct that we exited December 31, 2009 is reported within the MA segment. The prior periods have been revised to reflect this segment presentation. Medicaid Medicaid was established to provide medical assistance to low-income and disabled persons. It is state operated and implemented, although it is funded and regulated by both the state and federal governments. Our Medicaid segment includes plans for beneficiaries of TANF, SSI, ABD and state-based programs that are not part of Medicaid programs, such as CHIP and FHP programs for qualifying families that are not eligible for Medicaid because they exceed the applicable income thresholds. TANF generally provides assistance to low-income families with children; ABD and SSI generally provide assistance to low-income aged, blind or disabled individuals. The Medicaid programs and services we offer to our members vary by state and county and are designed to serve our various constituencies effectively in the communities we serve. Although our Medicaid contracts determine to a large extent the type and scope of health care services that we arrange for our members, in certain markets we customize our benefits in ways that we believe make our products more attractive. Our Medicaid plans provide our members with access to a broad spectrum of medical benefits from many facets of primary care and preventive programs to full hospitalization and tertiary care. In general, members are required to use our network, except in cases of emergencies, transition of care or when network providers are unavailable to meet their medical needs, and generally must receive a referral from their PCP in order to receive health care from specialists, such as surgeons or neurologists. Members do not pay any premiums, deductibles or co-payments for most of our Medicaid plans. 47 Table of Contents Medicare Advantage Medicare is a federal program that provides eligible persons age 65 and over, and some disabled persons, a variety of hospital, medical and prescription drug benefits. Our MA segment consists of MA plans which, following the exit of our PFFS product on December 31, 2009, is comprised of CCPs. MA is Medicare managed care alternative to Original Medicare, which provides individuals standard Medicare benefits directly through CMS. CCPs are administered through health maintenance organizations HMOs and generally require members to seek health care services and select a PCP from a network of health care providers. In addition, we offer Medicare Part D coverage, which provides prescription drug benefits, as a component of our MA plans. We cover a wide spectrum of medical services through our MA plans, including in some cases, additional benefits not covered by Original Medicare, such as vision, dental and hearing services. Through these enhanced benefits, the out-of-pocket expenses incurred by our members are reduced, which allows our members to better manage their health care costs. Most of our MA plans require members to pay a co-payment, which varies depending on the services and level of benefits provided. Typically, members of our MA CCPs are required to use our network of providers except in cases such as emergencies, transition of care or when specialty providers are unavailable to meet a member medical needs. MA CCP members may see out-of-network specialists if they receive referrals from their PCPs and may pay incremental cost-sharing. In most of our markets, we also offer special needs plans to individuals who are dually eligible for Medicare and Medicaid. These plans, commonly called D-SNPs, are designed to provide specialized care and support for beneficiaries who are eligible for both Medicare and Medicaid. We believe that our D-SNPs are attractive to these beneficiaries due to the enhanced be nefit offerings and clinical support programs. Prescription Drug Plans We offer stand-alone Medicare Part D coverage to Medicare-eligible beneficiaries through our PDP segment. The Medicare Part D prescription drug benefit is supported by risk sharing with the federal government through risk corridors designed to limit the losses and gains of the drug plans and by reinsurance for catastrophic drug costs. The government subsidy is based on the national weighted average monthly bid for this coverage, adjusted for risk factor payments. Additional subsidies are provided for dual-eligible beneficiaries and specified low-income beneficiaries. The Medicare Part D program offers national in-network prescription drug coverage that is subject to limitations in certain circumstances. Depending on medical coverage type, a beneficiary has various options for accessing drug coverage. Beneficiaries enrolled in Original Medicare can either join a stand-alone PDP or forego Part D drug coverage. Beneficiaries enrolled in MA CCPs can join a plan with Part D coverage, select a separate Part D plan, or forego Part D coverage. Segment Financial Performance Measures We use three measures to assess the performance of our reportable operating segments: premium revenue, MBR and gross margin. Our MBR measures the ratio of our medical benefits expense to premiums earned, after excluding Medicaid premium taxes. Our gross margin is defined as our premium revenue less our medical benefits expense. Our profitability depends in large part on our ability to, among other things, effectively price our health and prescription drug plans; predict and effectively manage medical benefits expense relative to the primarily fixed premiums we receive, including reserve estimates and pharmacy costs; contract with health care providers; and attract and retain members. In addition, factors such as regulation, competition and general economic conditions affect our operations and profitability. The effect of escalating health care costs, as well as any changes in our ability to negotiate competitive rates with our providers may impose further risks to our profitability and may have a material impact on our business, financial condition and results of operations. Premium Revenue We receive premiums from state and federal agencies for the members that are assigned to, or have selected, us to provide health care services under Medicaid and Medicare. The primarily fixed premiums we receive for each member varies according to the specific government program. The premiums we receive under each of our government benefit plans are generally determined at the beginning of the contract period. These premiums are subject to adjustment throughout the term of the contract, although such adjustments are typically made at the commencement of each new contract period. For further information regarding premium revenues, please refer below to Premium Revenue Recognition under Critical Accounting Estimates . 48 Table of Contents Medical Benefits Expense Our largest expense is the cost of medical benefits that we provide, which is based primarily on our arrangements with health care providers and utilization of health care services by our members. Our arrangements with providers primarily fall into two broad categories: capitation arrangements, pursuant to which we pay the capitated providers a fixed fee per member and fee-for-service as well as risk-sharing arrangements, pursuant to which the provider assumes a portion of the risk of the cost of the health care provided. Capitation payments represented 12.0%, 11.0% and 12.0% of our total medical benefits expense for the years ended December 31, 2010, 2009 and 2008, respectively. Other components of medical benefits expense are variable and require estimation and ongoing cost management. We use a variety of techniques to manage our medical benefits expense, including payment methods to providers, referral requirements, quality and disease management programs, reinsurance and member co-payments and premiums for some of our Medicare plans. National health care costs have been increasing at a higher rate than the general inflation rate; however, relatively small changes in our medical benefits expense relative to premiums that we receive can create significant changes in our financial results. Changes in health care laws, regulations and practices, levels of use of health care services, competitive pressures, hospital costs, major epidemics, terrorism or bio-terrorism, new medical technologies and other external factors could reduce our ability to manage our medical benefits expense effectively. Estimation of medical benefits payable and medical benefits expense is our most significant critical accounting estimate. For further information regarding medical benefits expense, please refer below to Estimating Medical Benefits Expense and Medical Benefits Payable under Critical Accounting Estimates . Gross Margin and Medical Benefits Ratio Our primary tools for measuring profitability are gross margin and MBR. Changes in gross margin and MBR from period to period result from, among other things, changes in Medicaid and Medicare funding, changes in the mix of Medicaid and Medicare membership, our ability to manage medical costs and changes in accounting estimates related to IBNR claims. We use gross margin and MBRs both to monitor our management of medical benefits and medical benefits expense and to make various business decisions, including what health care plans to offer, what geographic areas to enter or exit and which health care providers to select. Although gross margin and MBRs play an important role in our business strategy, we may be willing to enter new geographical markets and/or enter into provider arrangements that might produce a less favorable gross margi n and MBR if those arrangements, such as capitation or risk sharing, would likely lower our exposure to variability in medical costs or for other reasons. 49 Table of Contents Results of Operations The following table sets forth data from our Consolidated Statements of Operations, as well as other key data used in our results of operations discussion. The historical results are not necessarily indicative of results to be expected for any future period. Consolidated Statement of Operations Data: For the year ended December 31, 2010 2009 2008 Revenues: (In millions, except per share data) Premium $ 5,430.2 $ 6,867.2 $ 6,483.1 Investment and other income 10.0 10.9 38.8 Total revenues 5,440.2 6,878.1 6,521.9 Expenses: Medical benefits 4,536.6 5,862.5 5,530.2 Selling, general and administrative 895.9 805.2 845.0 Medicaid premium taxes 56.4 91.0 88.9 Depreciation and amortization 23.9 23.3 21.3 Interest 0.2 3.1 11.3 Goodwill impairment - - 78.3 Total expenses 5,513.0 6,785.1 6,575.0 (Loss) income before income taxes (72.8 ) 93.0 (53.1 ) Income tax (benefit) expense (19.4 ) 53.1 (16.3 ) Net (loss) income $ (53.4 ) $ 39.9 $ (36.8 ) Net (loss) income per common share: Basic $ (1.26 ) $ 0.95 $ (0.89 ) Diluted $ (1.26 ) $ 0.95 $ (0.89 ) Consolidated MBR 84.4 % 86.5 % 86.5 % Summary of Consolidated Financial Results Membership As of December 31, Membership: 2010 2009 2008 Medicaid 1,340,000 1,349,000 1,300,000 MA 116,000 225,000 246,000 PDP 768,000 747,000 986,000 Total Membership 2,224,000 2,321,000 2,532,000 As of December 31, 2010, we served approximately 2,224,000 members; a decrease of 97,000 members from the 2,321,000 members we served as of December 31, 2009. The overall membership decrease was due primarily to our December 31, 2009 exit from our PFFS product, which accounted for 95,000 MA members as of December 31, 2009 as well as a decline in MA CCP membership. The decrease in MA CCP resulted from the 2009 CMS Medicare marketing sanction, which was lifted in November 2009. However, we were not eligible to receive auto-assignments of low-income subsidy, dual-eligible beneficiaries into our PDP plans for January 2010 enrollment. We received auto assignments of PDP members in subsequent months, although such assignments were below the level we typically experience in t he month of January. Membership in all of our segments has sequentially increased for the last two quarters, which reflects the strengthening throughout 2010 of our MA sales processes and auto-assignments of additional PDP members and Medicaid members, primarily in Georgia. For 2011, we are targeting membership growth for both our MA and PDP segments. As of January 31, 2011, our MA membership increased by 2,000 members to 118,000 members and our PDP membership grew by approximately 150,000 members. Overall membership declined from December 31, 2008 to December 31, 2009 by 211,000 members. The decline was primarily due to lower PDP membership resulting from the 2009 PDP bid in which we were above the benchmark in 22 of 34 regions, partially offset by an increase in Medicaid members. 50 Table of Contents Net (loss) income For the year ended December 31, 2010, the net loss was $53.4 million compared to $39.9 million of net income for the same period in 2009. Excluding investigation-related and litigation-resolution costs of $167.6 million and $86.7 million, net of tax, net income would have been $114.2 million and $126.6 million for the years ended December 31, 2010 and 2009, respectively. The decrease in net income, as adjusted, for the year ended December 31, 2010 compared to the same period in the prior year was mainly the result of the loss of gross margin from the withdrawal of our PFFS product and increases in Medicare-related marketing costs, partially offset by our overall MBR improvement and reductions in SG&A expenses. Net income increased approximately $76.7 million to $39.9 million in the year ended December 31, 2009 from a net loss of $36.8 million in 2008. Excluding investigation-related and litigation-resolution costs of $86.7 million and $71.3 million, net of tax, net income would have been $126.6 million and $34.5 million for the years ended December 31, 2009 and 2008, respectively. The increase in net income, as adjusted, is due primarily to SG&A expense reduction and improvements in operating efficiency. Premium revenue As discussed below, premium revenue includes $56.4 million, $91.0 million and $88.9 million of Medicaid premium taxes for the years ended December 31, 2010, 2009 and 2008, respectively. Additionally, our MA segment includes results from the PFFS product that we exited on December 31, 2009. Our PFFS product contributed approximately $1,133.5 million and $983.5 million of premium revenue for the years ended December 31, 2009 and 2008, respectively . We continue to administer the PFFS program, which includes processing claims payments as well as providing member and provider services, for health care services provided prior to our exit on December 31, 2009. As a result, we recognized $3.5 million for retrospectiv e risk-adjusted premium settlements related to our PFFS product for the year ended December 31, 2010. Excluding the impact of premium taxes as well as premium revenue from our PFFS product, premium revenue for the year ended December 31, 2010 decreased $272.4 million, or 4.8%, to $5,370.3 million from $5,642.7 million for the same period in the prior year. The decrease in premium revenue is primarily attributable to the decline in membership in our MA segment and lower membership in our PDP segment in the first half of 2010 resulting from our loss of membership due to the 2009 CMS marketing sanction and higher returned premium under the risk corridor provisions of our PDP product, partially offset by an increase in Medicaid segment premium revenue due primarily to reductions by certain states that occurred earlier in the year and membership growth. For the year ended December 31, 2009, total premium revenue, excluding the impact of premium taxes and premium revenue from our PFFS product, increased $232.0 million, or 4.3%, to $5,642.7 million from $5,410.7 million for the same period in the prior year due to increases in premium rates in both the Medicaid and Medicare segments. Investment and other income For the year ended December 31, 2010, investment and other income decreased $0.9 million, or 8.3%, to $10.0 million from $10.9 million for the same period in the prior year. The decrease was primarily due to reduced market rates on lower average cash and investment balances, partially offset by the increase in other income attributed to shifting our investment portfolio during the third quarter of 2010 from tax-exempt to taxable investments, which typically generates a higher yield, and from other income derived primarily from co-payments collected on member prescriptions and sales of prescription drugs to non-members that can vary during any particular period. For the year ended December 31, 2009, investment and other income decreased approximately $27.9 million, or 71.9%, to $10.9 million from $38.8 million for the same period in the prior year. The decrease was primarily due to reduced market rates on lower average investment and cash balances. Medical benefits expense As previously discussed, our MA segment includes results from the PFFS product that we exited on December 31, 2009. Medical benefits expense for our PFFS product was $984.1 million and $850.6 million for the years ended December 31, 2009 and 2008, respectively. The wind-down of PFFS lowered medical benefits expense by approximately $33.4 million as a result of the favorable development of 2009 and prior years medical benefits payable. 51 Table of Contents Excluding the medical benefits expense from our PFFS product, total medical benefits expense for the year ended December 31, 2010 decreased $308.4 million, or 6.3%, to $4,570.0 million from $4,878.4 million for the same period in the prior year. The decrease in medical benefits expense was primarily due to the decline in membership in our other products, as well as a decrease in MBR for Medicaid and PDP. The consolidated MBR, excluding the impact from our PFFS product, was 85.1% and 86.5% for the year ended December 31, 2010 and 2009, respectively. Net favorable prior period reserve development, excluding PFFS, reduced MBR by 0.4% and 0.8% in 2010 and 2009, respectively. The decline in MBR is primarily due to improved performance of our Medicaid and PDP segments. In 2010, we benefited from utilization that was modestly below historical levels. We currently expect that MBRs for all three of our segments will increase in 2011 versus 2010. Ongoing medical expense management initiatives will be important to our competitive position given the challenging rate environment. Excluding the medical benefits expense from our PFFS product, total medical benefits expense for the year ended December 31, 2009 increased $198.8 million, or 4.2%, to $4,878.4 million from $4,679.6 million for the same period in the prior year. Our MBR was 86.5% in both of the years ended December 31, 2009 and 2008. We believe that medical benefits expense for the year ended December 31, 2008 should be adjusted to exclude $92.9 million of favorable claim reserve development recorded in 2007 that otherwise would have been recognized in the year ended December 31, 2008 if we had timely filed our 2007 Form 10-K. We were able to review substantially complete claims information that had become available due to the substantial lapse in time between December 31, 2007 and the date we filed our 2007 Form 10-K; therefore, the favorab le development was reported in 2007 instead of 2008 as it otherwise would have been. The adjusted medical benefit expense amount is a non-GAAP financial measure. Medical benefits expense for the year ended December 31, 2009, increased $425.2 million to approximately $4,878.4 million from approximately $4,586.7 million, as adjusted, for the same period in the prior year. Our MBR for the year ended December 31, 2009, was 86.5% compared to 84.8% as adjusted for the same period in 2008. The increase in medical benefits expense and MBR was primarily due to the change in the demographic mix of our members and overall increased utilization patterns. Selling, general and administrative expense SG&A expense includes aggregate costs related to the resolution of the previously disclosed governmental and Company investigations and litigation, such as: settlement accruals and related fair value accretion, legal fees and other similar costs; net of $25.8 million, $6.4 million and $0.3 million of D&O insurance recoveries during December 31, 2010, 2009 and 2008, respectively, related to the putative class action complaints. Please refer to Part I, Item 3 Legal Proceedings for a complete discussion of investigation-related and litig ation resolution costs. We believe it is appropriate to evaluate SG&A expense exclusive of these investigation-related and litigation resolution costs because they are not believed to be indicative of long-term business operations. A summary of these investigation-related resolution costs and a reconciliation of SG&A expense, including and excluding such costs, are presented below. For the year ended December 31, 2010 2009 2008 (In millions) SG&A expense $ 895.9 $ 805.2 $ 845.0 Adjustments: Investigation-related and litigation resolution costs(1) (258.7 ) (60.7 ) - Investigation-related administrative costs, net of D&O insurance policy recovery (7.2 ) (44.3 ) (103.0 ) Net investigation-related and litigation resolution costs (265.9 ) (105.0 ) (103.0 ) Adjusted SG&A expense $ 630.0 $ 700.2 $ 742.0 ____________ (1) Reflects costs related to resolving government investigations and related litigation, including the DPA with the USAO, inquiries by the SEC, inquiries by the Civil Division and the putative class action complaints. Such costs include: $80.0 million paid to the USAO in conjunction with the DPA in May 2009; $10.0 million paid to the SEC in 2009 and 2010; $135.6 million accrued in conjunction with inquiries by the Civil Division, including $76.5 million in 2009 and $59.1 million in 2010 after reaching a preliminary agreement with the Civil Division in June 2010; and $196.9 million accrued in June 2010 in conjunction with reaching a settlement agreement to resolve the putative securities class action complaints, including $194.0 million during the second quarter. Excluding the investigation-related and litigation resolution costs, our SG&A expense for the year ended December 31, 2010, decreased approximately $70.2 million, or 10.0%, to $630.0 million from $700.2 million for the same period in the prior year. The reduction in SG&A expense was mainly due to the exit of our PFFS product and operating efficiency, offset in part by increased costs for MA CCP marketing and infrastructure investments and severance costs associated with our organizational realignment implemented during 2010. 52 Table of Contents Our SG&A expense as a percentage of total revenue, excluding premium taxes ( SG&A ratio ), was 16.6% for the year ended December 31, 2010 compared to 11.9% for the same period in the prior year. After excluding the investigation-related and litigation resolution costs, our SG&A ratio for the year ended December 31, 2010 was 11.7% compared to 10.3% for the same period in the prior year. The increase in 2010 SG&A ratio was mainly due to a lower revenue base in 2010 resulting from the exit from our PFFS product and lower MA CCP marketing costs in 2009 due to the CMS marketing sanction. We anticipate that our 2011 adjusted SG&A ratio will be in the high 10% range. We believe this represents solid progress toward our long-term goal of an adjusted SG&A ratio in the low 10% range, based on our current business mix. Business simpl ification projects, process management in our shared services functions, and continued evaluation of our organizational design will drive further improvement in our administrative cost structure. Excluding the investigation-related and litigation resolution costs, our SG&A expense for the year ended December 31, 2009, decreased approximately $41.8 million, or 5.6%, to $700.2 million from $742.0 million for the same period in 2008. The reduction in SG&A expense was primarily driven by lower sales and marketing costs caused by the CMS sanction and reduced Florida Medicaid sales costs. The lower SG&A expense was partially offset by investments to improve operating efficiency and effectiveness and to remediate issues in conjunction with the 2009 CMS marketing sanction. Our SG&A ratio was 11.9% and 13.1% for the years ended December 31, 2009 and 2008, respectively. After excluding the investigation-related and litigation resolution costs, our SG&A ratio for the year ended December 31, 2009 was 1 0.3% compared to 11.5% for the same period in 2008. Medicaid premium taxes Certain state agencies place an assessment or tax on Medicaid premiums, which is included in the premium rates established in the Medicaid contracts with each state agency and recorded as a component of revenue, as well as administrative expense, when incurred. We exclude Medicaid premium taxes from premium revenue when calculating our key ratios as we believe the premium tax is not indicative of our operating performance. In October 2009, the State of Georgia stopped assessing taxes on Medicaid premiums remitted to us, which resulted in an equal reduction to premium revenues and expenses. However, effective July 1, 2010, the State of Georgia began assessing premium taxes again on Medicaid premiums. Therefore, during the last half of 2010, we were assessed and remitted taxes on premiums in Georgia. We were assessed and remitted taxes on premiums in Hawaii, Missouri, New York and Ohio throughout 2010. Medicaid premium taxes for the years ended December 31, 2010, 2009 and 2008 were $56.4 million, $91.0 million and $88.9 million, respectively. Income tax (benefit) expense Income tax benefit on pre-tax loss for the year ended December 31, 2010 was $19.4 million compared to income tax expense of $53.1 million on pre-tax income for the same period in the prior year, with an effective tax rate of 26.7% and 57.1% for the year ended December 31, 2010 and 2009, respectively. Our effective income tax rate in both years differed from the statutory tax rate primarily due to limitations on the deductibility of certain administrative expenses associated with the resolution of investigation-related matters as well as certain executive compensation costs. For the year ended December 31, 2009, income tax expense was $53.1 million on pre-tax income compared to $16.3 million of income tax benefit on pre-tax loss for the same period in 2008. The tax effective rate was approximately 57.1% and 30.7% in the years ended December 31, 2009 and 2008, respectively. The increase in the effective tax rate was primarily attributable to non-deductible amounts accrued in 2009 related to certain government investigation related matters and the tax benefit of the goodwill impairment incurred in 2008. 53 Table of Contents Reconciling Segment Results The following table reconciles our reportable segment results with our (loss) income before income taxes, as reported under GAAP. For the year ended December 31, Reconciling Segment Results Data: 2010 2009 2008 Gross margin: (Dollars in millions) Medicaid $ 461.5 $ 446.1 $ 453.6 Medicare Advantage 282.0 476.1 377.8 PDP 150.1 82.6 121.4 Total gross margin 893.6 1,004.8 952.8 Investment and other income 10.0 10.9 38.8 Other expenses 976.4 922.7 1,044.7 (Loss) income before income taxes $ (72.8) $ 93.0 $ (53.1) Medicaid Segment Results For the year ended December 31, 2010 2009 2008 Medicaid Segment Results Data: (Dollars in millions) Premium revenue $ 3,252.4 $ 3,165.7 $ 2,902.1 Medicaid premium taxes 56.4 91.0 88.9 Total premiums 3,308.8 3,256.7 2,991.0 Medical benefits expense 2,847.3 2,810.6 2,537.4 Gross margin 461.5 446.1 453.6 Medicaid Membership: Georgia 566,000 546,000 483,000 Florida 415,000 425,000 473,000 Other states 359,000 378,000 344,000 1,340,000 1,349,000 1,300,000 Medicaid MBR: 87.5% 88.8% 87.4% Excluding Medicaid premium taxes, Medicaid premium revenue for the year ended December 31, 2010 increased $86.7 million to $3,252.4 million from $3,165.7 million for the same period in the prior year. The increase in premium revenue was mainly due to rate increases implemented in most markets during the year and membership growth in Georgia, partially offset by the decrease in membership primarily in Florida. Membership decreased overall by approximately 9,000 members to 1,340,000 as of December 31, 2010, from 1,349,000 as of December 31, 2009. Medicaid medical benefits expense for the year ended December 31, 2010 increased $36.7 million to $2,847.3 million from $2,810.6 million from the same period in the prior year due mainly to the impact of prior period favorable reserve development experienced in 2009, increase in membership and a change in the demographic mix of our members. The decrease in Medicaid MBR for the year ended December 31, 2010 is mainly from premium increases during the past year and the impact of medical cost initiatives that we have implemented, partially offset by the impact of the net favorable prior year reserve development recognized in 2009 that exceeds the impact of the net favorable prior year reserve development recognized in 2010. We currently expect that the Medicaid MBR will increase in 2011 versus 2010, driven largely by rate increa ses that are below medical cost trends. Excluding Medicaid premium taxes, Medicaid premium revenue for the year ended December 31, 2009 increased $263.6 million to $3,165.7 million from $2,902.1 million for the same period in 2008. The increase in Medicaid segment revenue is primarily due to the inclusion of operations for the Hawaii ABD program, which was not present for the same period in 2008. This increase was partially offset by the impact of our withdrawal from certain Florida counties and our withdrawal from the Ohio ABD program, with the remaining change due to a change in the demographic mix of our members. Our Medicaid segment grew from 1,300,000 members at December 31, 2008 to 1,349,000 at December 31, 2009. 54 Table of Contents For the year ended December 31, 2009, Medicaid medical benefits expense increased $273.2 million, or 10.8%, to $2,810.6 million from $2,537.4 million for the same period in 2008. Our Medicaid MBR was 88.8% for the year ended December 31, 2009 and 87.4% for the same period in 2008. We believe that medical benefits expense for the year ended December 31, 2008 should be adjusted to exclude $39.5 million of favorable claim reserve development recorded in 2007 that otherwise would have been recognized the in year ended December 31, 2008 if we had timely filed our 2007 Form 10-K. We were able to review substantially complete claims information that had become available due to the substantial lapse in time between December 31, 2007 and the date we filed our 2007 Form 10-K; therefore, the favorable development was reported in 2007 instead of 2008 as it otherwise would ha ve been. The adjusted medical benefit expense amount is a non-GAAP financial measure. Medicaid medical benefits expense for the year ended December 31, 2009, increased $312.7 million to approximately $2,810.6 million from approximately $2,497.9 million, as adjusted, for the same period in 2008. Our MBR for the year ended December 31, 2009, was 88.8% compared to 86.1% as adjusted for the same period in 2008. The change in the demographic mix of our members and overall increased utilization patterns and costs of our members accounted for the increase in MBR. Medicare Advantage Segment Results For the year ended December 31, 2010 2009 2008 MA Segment Results Data: (Dollars in millions) Premium revenue $ 1,336.1 $ 2,775.5 $ 2,436.2 Medical benefits expense 1,054.1 2,299.4 2,058.4 Gross margin 282.0 476.1 377.8 MA Membership 116,000 225,000 246,000 MA MBR 78.9% 82.8% 84.5% As previously discussed, our MA segment includes results from the PFFS product that we exited on December 31, 2009. Our PFFS product contributed approximately $1,133.5 million and $983.5 million of premium revenue for the years ended December 31, 2009 and 2008, respectively. Medical benefits expense for our PFFS product was $984.1 million and $850.6 million for the years ended December 31, 2009 and 2008, respectively. We continue to administer the PFFS program, which includes processing claims payments as well as providing member and provider services, for health care services provided prior to our exit on December 31, 2009. As a result, we recognized $3.5 million for retrospective risk-adjusted premium settlements related to our PFFS product for the year ended December 31, 2010. The wind-down of PFFS also lowered medical benefits expense by approximately $33.4 million as a result of the fa vorable development of 2009 and prior years medical benefits payable. Excluding premium revenue from our PFFS product, MA premium revenue for the year ended December 31, 2010 decreased $309.3 million to $1,332.6 million from $1,641.9 million for the same period in the prior year. Membership decreased by approximately 109,000 members to 116,000 as of December 31, 2010, from 225,000 as of December 31, 2009. The decrease in MA premium revenue and membership was primarily attributable due to our inability to enroll new MA CCP members during the 2009 CMS marketing sanction period. Correspondingly, MA gross margin, excluding the impact from our PFFS product in 2009, decreased by $81.5 million for the year ended December 31, 2010, to $245.1 million from $326.6 million compared to the same period in the prior year due to the decrease in premiums, partially offset by $33.1 million of prior period favor able reserve development in 2010 related to the PFFS product. The decrease in the 2010 MA MBR was primarily related to the withdrawal of PFFS plans, which operated at an MBR above the segment average, and the prior period favorable reserve development related to the PFFS product. Excluding the impact from our PFFS product in 2009, the MA segment MBR increased from 80.1% for the year ended December 31, 2009 to 81.6% for the year ended December 31, 2010. The overall increase in MBR was attributed to a change in the demographic mix of our members and increased utilization patterns. Excluding premium revenue from our PFFS product in 2009 and 2008, MA segment premium revenue for the year ended December 31, 2009, increased $189.2 million to $1,641.9 million from $1,452.7 million for the same period in 2008. Our MA MBR, excluding the impact from our PFFS product in 2009 and 2008 was 80.1% for the year ended December 31, 2009 compared to 83.1% for the same period in 2008. We believe that MA medical benefits expense for the year ended December 31, 2008 should be adjusted to exclude $53.4 million of favorable claim reserve development recorded in 2007 that otherwise would have been recognized in year ended December 31, 2008 if we had timely filed our 2007 Form 10-K. We were able to review substantially complete claims information that had become available due to the substantial lapse in time between December 31, 2 007 and the date we filed our 2007 Form 10-K; therefore, the favorable development was reported in 2007 instead of 2008 as it otherwise would have been. The adjusted medical benefit expense amount is a non-GAAP financial measure. Excluding medical benefits expense from our PFFS product, MA medical benefits expense for the year ended December 31, 2009, increased $160.9 million to $1,315.3 million from $1,154.4 million, as adjusted, for the same period in 2008. For the year ended December 31, 2009, the MA MBR was 80.1% compared to 79.5%, as adjusted, for the same period in the prior year. The overall increase was driven primarily by the demographic mix of our members. 55 Table of Contents Prescription Drug Plans Segment Results For the year ended December 31, 2010 2009 2008 PDP Segment Results Data: (Dollars in millions) Premium revenue $ 785.4 $ 835.1 $ 1,055.8 Medical benefits expense 635.3 752.5 934.4 Gross margin 150.1 82.6 121.4 PDP Membership 768,000 747,000 986,000 PDP MBR 80.9% 90.1% 88.5% PDP premium revenue for the year ended December 31, 2010 decreased $49.7 million to $785.4 million from $835.1 million for the same period in the prior year. The lower premium revenue in 2010 is the result of lower membership in the first half of the year and a higher returned premium under the risk corridor provisions of the PDP product. The higher risk corridor returned premium is due to the lower claim expense in 2010. Membership increased by approximately 21,000 members to 768,000 as of December 31, 2010 from 747,000 as of December 31, 2009, despite lower membership throughout the first half of the year. PDP membership at the beginning of 2010 was lower than the end of 2009 as we were unable to receive auto-assigned membership in January 2010 following the release of the 2009 CMS marketing sanction. Membership gradually increased throughout the year as we became eligible to receive auto assignments and additional marketing activities. PDP MBR improved for the year ended December 31, 2010 due to improved performance of the product as a result of our revised product benefit design and increased generic drug dispensing through the benefit design. PDP gross margin for the year ended December 31, 2010 increased $67.5 million to $150.1 million from $82.6 million for the same period in the prior year. The improvement in gross margin was due mainly to better overall performance of the Part D product and improved MBR despite the decrease in premiums. Given our low MBR in 2010, we will likely experience an increase in our PDP MBR in 2011. This membership growth will result in our PDP segment making up a larger part of our business in 2011 versus 2010. Consequently, the seasonal medical benefits expense pattern of the PDP product will have a more pronounced effect on the aggregate operating results. During 2011, we also anticipate continued membership growth as a result of auto assignment of low income subsidy members. In addition, we believe our plans are well positioned relative to member utilization patterns, cost-sharing and focus on generic medications, for what is a very value and cost-conscious population. Therefore, we anticipate additional voluntary enrollment as well. For the year ended December 31, 2009, PDP segment premium revenue decreased $220.7 million to $835.1 million from $1,055.8 million for the same period in 2008. The decrease in PDP segment revenue is primarily due to a loss in PDP membership of approximately 239,000 members as we bid above the benchmark in 22 of 34 regions. PDP medical benefits expense decreased $181.9 million to $752.5 million from $934.4 million for the same period in the prior year. Our PDP MBR was 90.1% for the year ended December 31, 2009 compared to 88.5% for the same period in the prior year. The increase in MBR was driven by utilization patterns and the structure of our benefit design. 56 Table of Contents Liquidity and Capital Resources Overview Each of our existing and anticipated sources of cash is impacted by operational and financial risks that influence the overall amount of cash generated and the capital available to us. For a further discussion of risks that can affect our liquidity, see Part I, Item 1A Risk Factors . Cash Generating Activities Our business consists of operations conducted by our regulated subsidiaries, including HMOs and insurance subsidiaries, and our non-regulated subsidiaries. The primary sources of cash for our regulated subsidiaries include premium revenue, investment income and capital contributions made by us to our regulated subsidiaries. Our regulated subsidiaries are each subject to applicable state regulations that, among other things, require the maintenance of minimum levels of capital and surplus. Our regulated subsidiaries primary uses of cash include payment of medical expenses, management fees to our non-regulated third-party administrator subsidiary (the TPA ) and direct administrative costs, which are not covered by the agreement with the TPA, such as selling expenses and legal costs. 160; We refer collectively to the cash and investment balances maintained by our regulated subsidiaries as regulated cash and regulated investments, respectively. The primary sources of cash for our non-regulated subsidiaries are management fees and dividends received from our regulated subsidiaries and investment income. Our non-regulated subsidiaries primary uses of cash include payment of administrative costs not charged to our regulated subsidiaries for corporate functions, including administrative services related to claims payment, member and provider services and information technology. Other primary uses include capital contributions made by our non-regulated subsidiaries to our regulated subsidiaries. We refer collectively to the cash and investment balances available in our non-regulated subsidiaries as unregulated cash and unregulated investments, respectively. Cash Positions We currently believe that we will be able to meet our known monetary obligations, including the terms of the settlement agreements reached to resolve the government investigation and related litigation, and maintain sufficient liquidity to operate our business. However, one or more of our regulators could require one or more of our subsidiaries to maintain minimum levels of statutory net worth in excess of the amount required under the applicable state laws if the regulators were to determine that such a requirement were in the interest of our members. Further, there may be other potential adverse developments that could impede our ability to meet our obligations. The table below presents our cash and investment positions as of December 31, 2010 and 2009. As of December 31, 2010 2009 Cash and cash equivalents: (Dollars in millions) Regulated $ 1,168.9 $ 1,040.5 Unregulated 190.6 117.6 $ 1,359.5 $ 1,158.1 Investments: Regulated Auction rate securities $ 40.2 $ 49.4 Other 129.1 62.2 $ 169.3 $ 111.6 Unregulated Auction rate securities $ 2.3 $ 2.3 Other 0.1 0.5 2.4 2.8 $ 171.7 $ 114.4 Metrics: Percentage of investments in certificates of deposit 44.4% 93.9% Weighted-average maturity of certificates of deposit 68 Days 40 Days Annual tax equivalent portfolio yield 0.5% 0.6% During 2010, we received $45.7 million in dividends from our regulated subsidiaries, which increased our unregulated cash. During 2009, three of our regulated subsidiaries declared and paid dividends to one of our non-regulated subsidiaries in the aggregate amount of $44.4 million. On December 31, 2008, three of our regulated subsidiaries, declared dividends to one of our non-regulated subsidiaries in the aggregate amount of $105.1 million, of which two dividends were paid in December 2008 and one dividend which was paid in January 2009. 57 Table of Contents Initiatives to Increase Our Unregulated Cash We are pursuing alternatives to raise additional unregulated cash. Some of these initiatives include, but are not limited to, consideration of obtaining dividends from certain of our regulated subsidiaries to the extent that we are able to access any available excess capital and/or accessing the debt and equity capital markets. However, we cannot provide any assurances that we will obtain applicable state regulatory approvals for additional dividends to our non-regulated subsidiaries by our regulated subsidiaries or be successful in accessing the capital markets if we determine to do so. Credit Facility We entered into a credit agreement on May 12, 2010, which was subsequently amended on May 25, 2010 (as amended, the Credit Agreement ). The Credit Agreement provides for a $65.0 million committed revolving credit facility that expires on November 12, 2011. Borrowings under the Credit Agreement may be used for general corporate purposes. The Credit Agreement is guaranteed by us and our subsidiaries, other than our HMO and insurance subsidiaries. In addition, the Credit Agreement is secured by first priority liens on our personal property and the personal property of our subsidiaries, other than the personal property and equity interests of our HMO and insurance subsidiaries. Borrowings designated by us as Alternate Base Rate borrowings bear interest at a rate per annum equal to (i) the greatest of (a) the Prime Rate (as defined in the Credit Agreement) in effect on such day; (b) the Federal Funds Effective Rate (as defined in the Credit Agreement) in effect on such day plus 1/2 of 1%; and (c) the Adjusted LIBO Rate (as defined in the Credit Agreement) for a one month interest period on such day plus 1%; plus (ii) 1.5%. Borrowings designated by us as Eurodollar borrowings bear interest at a rate per annum equal to the Adjusted LIBO Rate for the interest period in effect for such borrowing plus 2.5%. The Credit Agreement includes negative covenants that limit certain of our activities, including restrictions on our ability to incur additional indebtedness, and financial covenants that require a minimum ratio of cash flow to total debt, a maximum ratio of total liabilities to consolidated net worth and a minimum level of statutory net worth for our HMO and insurance subsidiaries. The Credit Agreement also contains customary representations and warranties that must be accurate in order for us to borrow under the Credit Agreement. In addition, the Credit Agreement contains customary events of default. If an event of default occurs and is continuing, we may be required to immediately repay all amounts outstanding under the Credit Agreement, and the commitments under the Credit Agreement may be terminated. As of December 31, 2010, the credit facility has not been drawn upon and we remain in compliance with all covenants. Auction Rate Securities As of December 31, 2010, all of our long-term investments were comprised of municipal note investments with an auction reset feature ( auction rate securities ). These notes are issued by various state and local municipal entities for the purpose of financing student loans, public projects and other activities, which carry investment grade credit ratings. Liquidity for these auction rate securities is typically provided by an auction process which allows holders to sell their notes and resets the applicable interest rate at pre-determined intervals, usually every seven, 14, 28 or 35 days. As of the date of this Form 10-K, auctions have failed for $46.2 million of our auction rate securities and there is no assurance that auctions on the remaining auction rate securities in our investment portfolio will succeed in the futur e. An auction failure means that the parties wishing to sell their securities could not be matched with an adequate volume of buyers. In the event that there is a failed auction the indenture governing the security requires the issuer to pay interest at a contractually defined rate that is generally above market rates for other types of similar instruments. The securities for which auctions have failed will continue to accrue interest at the contractual rate and be auctioned every seven, 14, 28 or 35 days until the auction succeeds, the issuer calls the securities, or they mature. As a result, our ability to liquidate and fully recover the carrying value of our remaining auction rate securities in the near term may be limited or non-existent. In addition, while all of our auction rate securities currently carry investment grade ratings, if the issuers are unable to successfully close future auctions and their credit ratings deteriorate, we may in the future be required to record an impairment charge on these investments. Although auctions continue to fail, we believe we will be able to liquidate these securities without significant loss, and we currently believe these securities are not impaired, primarily due to government guarantees or municipal bond insurance and our ability and present intent to hold these securities until maturity or market stability is restored; however, it could take until the final maturity of the underlying securities to realize our investments recorded value. The final maturity of the underlying securities could be as long as 29 years. The weighted-average life of the underlying securities for our auction rate securities portfolio is 23 years. During 2010, auction rate securities of $10.9 million, in the aggregate, were called at par, at the option of the issuer. 58 Table of Contents Investigation-Related Costs We have expended significant financial resources in connection with the investigations and related matters. Since the inception of these investigations through December 31, 2010, we have incurred a total of approximately $202.1 million for administrative expenses associated with, or consequential to, these governmental and Company investigations specifically for legal fees, accounting fees, consulting fees, employee recruitment and retention costs and other similar expenses, prior to any insurance recoveries. In August 2010, we entered into an agreement and release with the carriers of our D&O liability insurance relating to coverage we sought for claims relating to the previously disclosed government investigations and related litigation. We agreed to accept immediate payment of $32.5 million, including $6.7 million received by us in prior years, in satisfaction of the $45.0 million face amount of the relevant D&O insurance policies and the carriers agreed to waive any rights they may have to challenge our coverage under the policies. The agreement and release did not include a $10.0 million face amount policy we maintain for non-indemnifiable securities claims by directors and officers during the same time period and such policy is not affected by the agreement and release. Accordingly, we recorded the $25.8 million of insurance proceeds as a reduction to SG&A expenses at the time the agreement was executed. No additional recoveries with respect to such matters are expected under our insurance policies and all expenses incurred by us in the future for these matters will not be further reimbursed by our insurance policies. We currently maintain directors and officers liability insurance in the amount of $175.0 million for other matters not addressed above. Regulatory Capital and Dividend Restrictions Our operations are conducted primarily through HMO and insurance subsidiaries. These subsidiaries are licensed by the insurance department in the state in which they operate, except our New York HMO subsidiary, which is licensed as a Prepaid Health Services Plan by the New York State Department of Health, and are subject to the rules, regulation and oversight of the applicable state agencies in the areas of licensing and solvency. State insurance laws and regulations prescribe accounting practices for determining statutory net income and capital and surplus. Each of our regulated subsidiaries is required to report regularly on its operational and financial performance to the appropriate regulatory agency in the state in which it is licensed. These reports describe each of our regulated subsidiaries capi tal structure, ownership, financial condition, certain intercompany transactions and business operations. From time to time, any of our regulated subsidiaries may be selected to undergo periodic audits, examinations or reviews by the applicable state agency of our operational and financial assertions. Our regulated subsidiaries generally must obtain approval from, or provide notice to, the state in which it is domiciled before entering into certain transactions such as declaring dividends in excess of certain thresholds, entering into other arrangements with related parties, and acquisitions or similar transactions involving an HMO or insurance company, or any change in control. For purposes of these laws, in general, control commonly is presumed to exist when a person, group of persons or entity, directly or indirectly, owns, controls or holds the power to vote 10% or more of the voting securities of another entity. Each of our HMO and insurance subsidiaries must maintain a minimum amount of statutory capital determined by statute or regulation. The minimum statutory capital requirements differ by state and are generally based on a percentage of annualized premium revenue, a percentage of annualized health care costs, a percentage of certain liabilities, statutory minimum, RBC requirements or other financial ratios. The RBC requirements are based on guidelines established by the NAIC, and have been adopted by most states. As of December 31, 2010, our HMO operations in Connecticut, Georgia, Illinois, Indiana, Louisiana, Missouri, New Jersey, Ohio and Texas as well as three of our insurance company subsidiaries were subject to RBC requirements. The RBC requirements may be modified as each state legislat ure deems appropriate for that state. The RBC formula, based on asset risk, underwriting risk, credit risk, business risk and other factors, generates the ACL, which represents the amount of capital required to support the regulated entity business. For states in which the RBC requirements have been adopted, the regulated entity typically must maintain a minimum of the greater of 200% the required ACL or the minimum statutory net worth requirement calculated pursuant to pre-RBC guidelines. Our subsidiaries operating in Texas, Georgia and Ohio are required to maintain statutory capital at RBC levels equal to 225%, 250% and 300%, respectively, of the applicable ACL. Failure to maintain these requirements would trigger regulatory action by the state. At December 31, 2010, our HMO and insurance subsidiaries were in compliance with these minimum capital requirements. The combined statutory capital and surplus of our HMO and insurance subsidiaries was approximately $695.0 million and $619.0 million at December 31, 2010 and 2009, respectively, compared to the required surplus of approximately $300.0 million and $370.0 million at December 31, 2010 and 2009, respectively. 59 Table of Contents The statutory framework for our regulated subsidiaries minimum capital changes over time. For instance, RBC requirements may be adopted by more of the states in which we operate. These subsidiaries are also subject to their state regulators overall oversight powers. For example, the state of New York adopted regulations that increased the reserve requirement by 150% over an eight-year period that will be fully implemented by 2013. In addition, regulators could require our subsidiaries to maintain minimum levels of statutory net worth in excess of the amount required under the applicable state laws if the regulators determine that maintaining such additional statutory net worth is in the best interest of our members and other constituents. Moreover, if we expa nd our plan offerings in new states or pursue new business opportunities, we may be required to make additional statutory capital contributions. In addition to the foregoing requirements, our regulated subsidiaries are subject to restrictions on their ability to make dividend payments, loans and other transfers of cash. Dividend restrictions vary by state, but the maximum amount of dividends which can be paid without prior approval from the applicable state is subject to, among other things, restrictions relating to statutory capital, surplus and net income for the previous year. States may disapprove any dividend that, together with other dividends paid by a subsidiary in the prior twelve months, exceeds the regulatory maximum as computed for the subsidiary based on its statutory surplus and net income. Also, we may only invest in the types of investments allowed by the state in order to qualify as admitted assets and we are required by certain states to deposit or pledge assets that are considered as restricted assets. At December 31, 2010 and 2009, all of our restricted assets consisted of cash and cash equivalents, money market accounts, certificates of deposits, and U.S. Government Securities. Overview of Cash Flow Activities For the years ended December 31, 2010, 2009 and 2008 our cash flows from operations are summarized as follows: For the Years Ended December 31, 2010 2009 2008 (In millions) Net cash provided by operations $ 223.1 $ 57.9 $ 296.4 Net cash (used in) provided by investing activities (60.5 ) 63.6 (91.1 ) Net cash provided by (used in) financing activities 38.9 (145.4 ) (31.8 ) Net cash provided by operations The net cash inflow from operations for the years ended December 31, 2010, 2009 and 2008 was primarily due to changes in the receivables and liabilities due to timing of cash receipts and payments. Cash flow in 2009 was negatively impacted by payments related to settlements reached with the USAO and SEC. Net cash (used in) provided by investing activities In 2010, investing activities consisted primarily of net purchases of investments totaling approximately $56.0 million as well as $27.5 million of additions to property, equipment and capitalized software, partially offset by net proceeds from the maturity of restricted investments totaling approximately $23.0 million. In 2009, investing activities consisted primarily of net proceeds from the maturity of restricted investments totaling approximately $68.4 million and the net proceeds from the sale and maturities of investments totaling approximately $11.4 million, partially offset by increases in property, equipment and capitalized software totaling approximately $16.1 million. In 2008, investing activities consisted primarily of $124.8 million in proceeds from the sale and maturity of investments, net of investment purchases. An additional $109.8 million was used in investing activities to purchase restricted investments, net of proceeds received from the sale of restricted investments. Additions to property, equipment and capitalized software used approximately $19.6 million. Investing activities also consisted primarily of net cash used in Funds receivable for the benefit of members totaling $86.5 million. These funds, which represent PDP member subsidies and pass-through payments from government partners, are not accounted for in our results of operations since they represent pass-through payments from our government partners to fund deductibles, co-payments and other member benefits for certain of our members. 60 Table of Contents Net cash provided by (used in) financing activities In 2010, financing activities consisted primarily of funds held for the benefit of members, which increased approximately $44.7 million. These PDP member subsidies represent pass-through payments from government partners and are not accounted for in our results of operations since they represent payments to fund deductibles, co-payments and other member benefits for certain of our members that normally fluctuate. In 2009, financing activities consisted primarily of the repayment in full of the outstanding amount of $152.8 million under the credit facility on its due date. In 2008, financing activities consisted primarily of net cash used in funds held for the benefit of members totaling $31.8 million. These funds, which represent PDP member subsidies and pass-through payments from government partners, are not accounted for in our results of operations since they represent pass-through payments from our government partners to fund deductibles, co-payments and other member benefits for certain of our members. Off Balance Sheet Arrangements At December 31, 2010, we did not have any off-balance sheet financing arrangements except for operating leases as described in the table below. Commitments and Contingencies The following table sets forth information regarding our contractual obligations as of December 31, 2010. Payments due to period Less Than 1 - 3 3 - 5 More than Total 1 Year Years Years 5 Years (In millions) Operating leases $ 66.3 $ 15.2 $ 26.7 $ 18.3 $ 6.1 Capital leases 8.1 2.5 3.9 1.7 - Purchase obligations(1) 115.2 54.1 57.7 3.4 - Unrecognized tax benefit 3.4 - - - 3.4 Civil Division settlement(2) 137.5 34.4 68.7 34.4 - Attorneys' fees for qui tam relators(3) 5.0 5.0 - - - Class Action settlement(4) 200.0 87.5 - - 112.5 Total $ 535.5 $ 198.7 $ 157.0 $ 57.8 $ 122.0 ____________ (1) Our purchase obligations include commitments under contracts for equipment leases, software maintenance and the purchase of pharmaceuticals from our pharmacy benefit manager. (2) Based on the terms of the Preliminary Settlement reached with the Civil Division in June 2010 to settle pending civil inquiries related to qui tam complaints filed by relators against us. The Preliminary Settlement is subject to completion and approval of an executed written settlement agreement and other government approvals, as discussed in Part I, Item 3 Legal Proceedings . (3) During the fourth quarter of 2010, we recorded an estimate related to the qui tam relators attorneys fees to be paid in addition to the Preliminary Settlement amount. (4) Based on the terms of an agreement reached with the Lead Plaintiffs in December 2010 to resolve the Class Action Complaints that is subject to approval by the Federal Court, as discussed in Part I, Item 3 Legal Proceedings . We are not an obligor under or guarantor of any indebtedness of any other party; however, we may have to pay referral claims of health care providers under contract with us who are not able to pay costs of medical services provided by other providers. 61 Table of Contents Critical Accounting Estimates In the ordinary course of business, we make a number of estimates and assumptions relating to the reporting of our results of operations and financial condition in conformity with accounting principles generally accepted in the United States. We base our estimates on historical experience and on various other assumptions that we believe to be reasonable under the circumstances. Actual results could differ significantly from those estimates under different assumptions and conditions. We believe that the accounting estimates relating to premium revenue recognition, medical benefits payable and medical benefits expense, and goodwill and intangible assets are those that are most important to the portrayal of our financial condition and results of operations and require management most difficult, subjective and complex judgments, o ften as a result of the need to make estimates about the effect of matters that are inherently uncertain. Premium Revenue Recognition We receive premiums from state and federal agencies for the members that are assigned to, or have selected, us to provide health care services under Medicaid and Medicare. The premiums we receive for each member vary according to the specific government program and are generally determined at the beginning of the contract period. These premiums are subject to adjustment throughout the term of the contract by CMS and the states, although such adjustments are typically made at the commencement of each new contract renewal period. We recognize premium revenues in the period in which we are obligated to provide services to our members. Premiums are billed monthly for coverage in the following month and we are paid generally in the month in which we provide services. We estimate, on an ongoing basis, the amount of member billings that may not be fully collectible or that will be returned based on historical trends, compliance with requirements for certain contracts to expend a minimum percentage of premiums on eligible medical expense, and other factors. An allowance is established for the estimated amount that may not be collectible and a liability is established for premium expected to be returned. Historically, the allowance has not been significant relative to premium revenue. Premium payments that we receive are based upon eligibility lists produced by the government. We verify these lists to determine whether we have been paid for the correct premium category and program. From time to time, the states or CMS requires us to reimburse them for premiums that we received based on an eligibility list that a state, CMS or we later discover contains individuals who were not eligible for any government-sponsored program or belong to a different plan other than ours. The verification and subsequent membership changes may result in additional amounts due to us or we may owe premiums back to the government. The amounts receivable or payable identified by us through reconciliation and verification of agency eligibility lists relate to current and prior periods. The amounts receivable from government agencies for reco nciling items were $0.3 million and $64.3 million at December 31, 2010 and 2009, respectively. The amounts due to government agencies for reconciling items were $63.3 million and $105.1 million at December 31, 2010 and 2009, respectively. We record adjustments to revenues based on member retroactivity. These adjustments reflect changes in the number and eligibility status of enrollees subsequent to when revenue was billed. We estimate the amount of outstanding retroactivity adjustments each period and adjust premium revenue accordingly; if appropriate, the estimates of retroactivity adjustments are based on historical trends, premiums billed, the volume of member and contract renewal activity and other information. Changes in member retroactivity adjustment estimates had a minimal impact on premiums recorded during the periods presented. Our government contracts establish monthly rates per member that may be adjusted based on member demographics such as age, working status or medical history. Medicaid Our Medicaid segment generates revenues primarily from premiums received from the states in which we operate health plans. We receive a fixed premium PMPM pursuant to our state contracts. Our Medicaid contracts with state governments are generally multi-year contracts subject to annual renewal provisions. Annual rate changes are recorded when they become effective. We generally receive premium payments during the month in which we provide services and recognize premium revenue during the period in which we are obligated to provide such services to our members. In some instances, our base premiums are subject to risk score adjustments based on the acuity of our membership. Generally, the risk score is determined by the state analyzing encounter submissions of processed claims data to determin e the acuity of our membership relative to the entire state Medicaid membership. In Georgia, Illinois, Missouri, New York and Ohio, we are eligible to receive supplemental payments for newborns and/or obstetric deliveries. Each state contract is specific as to what is required before payments are generated. Upon delivery of a newborn, each state is notified according to the contract. Revenue is recognized in the period that the delivery occurs and the related services are provided to our member. Additionally, in some states, supplemental payments are received for certain services such as high cost drugs and early childhood prevention screenings. Any amounts that have been earned and have not been received from the state by the end of the period are recorded on our balance sheet as premium receivables. Revenues are recorded based on membership and eligibility data provided by the states, which may be adjusted by th e states for any subsequent updates to this data. Historically, these eligibility adjustments have been immaterial in relation to total revenue recorded and are reflected in the period known. 62 Table of Contents Our Florida Medicaid and Healthy Kids contracts and Illinois Medicaid contract require us to expend a minimum percentage of premiums on eligible medical expense, and to the extent that we expend less than the minimum percentage of the premiums on eligible medical expense, we are required to refund all or some portion of the difference between the minimum and our actual allowable medical expense. We estimate the amounts due to the state as a return of premium each period based on the terms of our contract with the applicable state agency. Medicare Advantage The amount of premiums we receive for each MA member is established by contract, although the rates vary according to a combination of factors, including upper payment limits established by CMS, the member geographic location, age, gender, medical history or condition, or the services rendered to the member. Our MA contracts with CMS generally have terms of one year and expire at the end of each calendar year. MA premiums are due monthly and are recognized as revenue during the period in which we are obligated to provide services to members. Prescription Drug Plans As with our traditional MA plans, we provide written bids to CMS for our PDPs, which include the estimated costs of providing prescription drug benefits over the plan year. The payments we receive monthly from CMS and members are based on our estimated costs for providing prescription drug insurance coverage. We recognize premium revenues for providing this insurance coverage ratably over the term of our contract. Our PDP contracts with CMS generally has a term of one year. The amount of CMS payments relating to PDP coverage is subject to adjustment, positive or negative, based upon the application of risk corridors that compare our prescription drug costs in our bids to CMS to our actual prescription drug costs. Settlement of the risk corridor payment is based on a reconciliation made approximately nine months after the clo se of each calendar year. Risk-Adjusted Premiums CMS employs a risk-adjustment model to determine the premium amount it pays for each member. This model apportions premiums paid to all MA plans according to the health status of each beneficiary enrolled. As a result, our CMS monthly premium payments per member may change materially, either favorably or unfavorably. The CMS risk-adjustment model pays more for Medicare members with predictably higher costs. Diagnosis data from inpatient and ambulatory treatment settings are used to calculate the risk-adjusted premiums we receive. We collect claims and encounter data and submit the necessary diagnosis data to CMS within prescribed deadlines. After reviewing the respective submissions, CMS establishes the premium payments to MA plans generally at the beginning of the ca lendar year, and then adjusts premium levels on two separate occasions on a retroactive basis. The first retroactive adjustment for a given fiscal year generally occurs during the third quarter of such fiscal year. The Initial CMS Settlement represents the updating of risk scores for the current year based on the severity of claims incurred in the prior fiscal year. CMS then issues the Final CMS Settlement. We reassess the estimates of the Initial CMS Settlement and the Final CMS Settlement each reporting period and any resulting adjustments are made to MA premium revenue. We develop our estimates for risk-adjusted premiums utilizing historical experience and predictive models as sufficient member risk score data becomes available over the course of each CMS plan year. Our models are populated with available risk score data on our members. Risk premium adjustments are based on member risk score data from the previous year. Risk score data for members who entered our plans during the current plan year, however, is not available for use in our models; therefore, we make assumptions regarding the risk scores of this subset of our member population. All such estimated amounts are periodically updated as additional diagnosis code information is reported to CMS and adjusted to actual amounts when the ultimate adjustment settlements are either received f rom CMS or we receive notification from CMS of such settlement amounts. As a result of the variability of factors that determine such estimates, including plan risk scores, the actual amount of CMS retroactive payment could be materially more or less than our estimates. Consequently, our estimate of our plans risk scores for any period, and any resulting change in our accrual of MA premium revenues related thereto, could have a material adverse effect on our results of operations, financial position and cash flows. Historically, we have not experienced significant differences between the amounts that we have recorded and the revenues that we ultimately receive. The data provided to CMS to determine the risk score is subject to audit by CMS even after the annual settlements occur. These audits may result in the refund of pr emiums to CMS previously received by us. While our experience to date has not resulted in a material refund, this refund could be significant in the future, which would reduce our premium revenue in the year that CMS determines repayment is required. 63 Table of Contents CMS has performed and continues to perform RADV audits of selected MA plans to validate the provider coding practices under the risk adjustment model used to calculate the premium paid for each MA member. Our Florida MA plan was selected by CMS for audit for the 2007 contract year and we anticipate that CMS will conduct additional audits of other plans and contract years on an ongoing basis. The CMS audit process selects a sample of 201 enrollees for medical record review from each contract selected. We have responded to CMS audit requests by retrieving and submitting all available medical records and provider attestations to substantiate CMS-sampled diagnosis codes. CMS will use this documentation to calculate a payment error rate for our Florida MA plan 2007 premiums. CMS has not indicated a schedule for processing or otherwise responding to our submissions. CMS has indicated that payment adjustments resulting from its RADV audits will not be limited to risk scores for the specific beneficiaries for which errors are found, but will be extrapolated to the relevant plan population. In late December 2010, CMS issued a draft audit sampling and payment error calculation methodology that it proposes to use in conducting these audits. CMS invited public comment on the proposed audit methodology and announced in early February 2011 that it will revise its proposed approach based on the comments received. CMS has not given a specific timetable for issuing a final version of the audit sampling and payment err or calculation methodology. Given that the RADV audit methodology is new and is subject to modification, there is substantial uncertainty as to how it will be applied to MA organizations like our Florida MA plan. At this time, we do not know whether CMS will require retroactive or subsequent payment adjustments to be made using an audit methodology that may not compare the coding of our providers to the coding of Original Medicare and other MA plan providers, or whether any of our other plans will be randomly selected or targeted for a similar audit by CMS . We are also unable to determine whether any conclusions that CMS may make, based on the audit of our plan and others, will cause us to change our revenue estimation process. Because of this lack of clarity from CMS, we are unable to estimate with any reasonable confidence a coding or payment error rate or predict the impact of extrapola ting an applicable error rate to our Florida MA plan 2007 premiums. However, it is likely that a payment adjustment will occur as a result of these audits, and that any such adjustment could have a material adverse effect on our results of operations, financial position, and cash flows, possibly in 2011 and beyond. Estimating Medical Benefits Expense and Medical Benefits Payable The cost of medical benefits is recognized in the period in which services are provided and includes an estimate of the cost of IBNR medical benefits. Medical benefits payable has two main components: direct medical expenses and medically-related administrative costs. Direct medical expenses include amounts paid or payable to hospitals, physicians and providers of ancillary services, such as laboratories and pharmacies. Medically-related administrative costs include items such as case and disease management, utilization review services, quality assurance and on-call nurses, which are recorded in Selling, general, and administrative expense. Medical benefits payable on our Consolidated Balance Sheets represents amounts for claims fully adjudicated awaiting payment disbursement and estimates for IBNR. The following table provides a reconciliation of the total medical benefits payable balances as of December 31, 2010, 2009 and 2008: As of December 31, 2010 % of Total 2009 % of Total 2008 % of Total (Dollars in millions) Claims adjudicated, but not yet paid $ 50.9 7 % $ 53.0 7 % $ 77.1 10 % IBNR 692.1 93 % 749.5 93 % 689.1 90 % Total Medical benefits payable $ 743.0 $ 802.5 $ 766.2 The medical benefits payable estimate has been and continues to be our most significant estimate included in our financial statements. We historically have used and continue to use a consistent methodology for estimating our medical benefits expense and medical benefits payable. Our policy is to record management best estimate of medical benefits payable based on the experience and information available to us at the time. This estimate is determined utilizing standard actuarial methodologies based upon historical experience and key assumptions consisting of trend factors and completion factors using an assumption of moderately adverse conditions, which vary by business segment. These standard actuarial methodologies include using, among other factors, contractual requirements, historic utilization trends, the interval between the date services are rendered and the date claims are paid, denied claims activity, disputed claims activity, benefits changes, expected health care cost inflation, seasonality patterns, maturity of lines of business and changes in membership. 64 Table of Contents The factors and assumptions described above that are used to develop our estimate of medical benefits expense and medical benefits payable inherently are subject to greater variability when there is more limited experience or information available to us. The ultimate claims payment amounts, patterns and trends for new products and geographic areas cannot be precisely predicted at their onset, since we, the providers and the members do not have experience in these products or geographic areas. Standard accepted actuarial methodologies, discussed above, would allow for this inherent variability. This can result in larger differences between the originally estimated medical benefits payable and the actual claims amounts paid. Conversely, during periods where our products and geographies are more stable and mature, we have more reliable c laims payment patterns and trend experience. With more reliable data, we should be able to more closely estimate the ultimate claims payment amounts; therefore, we may experience smaller differences between our original estimate of medical benefits payable and the actual claim amounts paid. In developing our estimates, we apply different estimation methods depending on the month for which incurred claims are being estimated. For the more recent months, which constitute the majority of the amount of the medical benefits payable, we estimate claims incurred by applying observed trend factors to the fixed fee PMPM costs for prior months, which costs have been estimated using completion factors, in order to estimate the PMPM costs for the most recent months. We validate our estimates of the most recent PMPM costs by comparing the most recent months utilization levels to the utilization levels in prior months and actuarial techniques that incorporate a historical analysis of claim payments, including trends in cost of care provided and timeliness of submission and processing of claims. Many aspects of the managed care business are not predictable. These aspects include the incidences of illness or disease state (such as congestive heart failure cases, cases of upper respiratory illness, the length and severity of the flu season, diabetes, the number of full-term versus premature births and the number of neonatal intensive care babies). Therefore, we must continually monitor our historical experience in determining our trend assumptions to reflect the ever-changing mix, needs and size of our membership. Among the factors considered by management are changes in the level of benefits provided to members, seasonal variations in utilization, identified industry trends and changes in provider reimbursement arrangements, including changes in the percentage of reimbursements made on a capitation as opposed to a fee-for-serv ice basis. These considerations are reflected in the trends in our medical benefits expense. Other external factors such as government-mandated benefits or other regulatory changes, catastrophes and epidemics may impact medical cost trends. Other internal factors such as system conversions and claims processing interruptions may impact our ability to accurately predict estimates of historical completion factors or medical cost trends. Medical cost trends potentially are more volatile than other segments of the economy. Management uses considerable judgment in determining medical benefits expense trends and other actuarial model inputs. We believe that the amount of medical benefits payable as of December 31, 2010 is adequate to cover our ultimate liability for unpaid claims as of that date; however, actual payments may differ from established estimates. If the completion factors we used in estimating our IBNR for the year ended December 31, 2010 were decreased by 1%, our net loss would increase by appro ximately $54.4 million. If the completion factors were increased by 1%, our net loss would decrease by approximately $53.2 million. We record reserves for estimated referral claims related to health care providers under contract with us who are financially troubled or insolvent and who may not be able to honor their obligations for the costs of medical services provided by other providers. In these instances, we may be required to honor these obligations for legal or business reasons. Based on our current assessment of providers under contract with us, such losses have not been and are not expected to be significant. Changes in medical benefits payable estimates are primarily the result of obtaining more complete claims information and medical expense trend data over time. Volatility in members needs for medical services, provider claims submissions and our payment processes result in identifiable patterns emerging several months after the causes of deviations from assumed trends occur. Since our estimates are based upon PMPM claims experience, changes cannot typically be explained by any single factor, but are the result of a number of interrelated variables, all influencing the resulting medical cost trend. Differences in our financial statements between actual experience and estimates used to establish the liability, which we refer to as prior period developments, are recorded in the period when such differences become known, and have th e effect of increasing or decreasing the reported medical benefits expense and resulting MBR in such periods. 65 Table of Contents In establishing our estimate of reserves for IBNR at each reporting period, we use standard actuarial methodologies based upon historical experience and key assumptions consisting of trend factors and completion factors, which vary by business segment, to determine an estimate of the base reserve. Actuarial standards of practice require that a margin for uncertainty be considered in determining the estimate for unpaid claim liabilities. If a margin is included, the claim liabilities should be adequate under moderately adverse conditions. Therefore, we make an additional estimate in the process of establishing the IBNR, which also uses standard actuarial techniques, to account for adverse conditions that may cause actual claims to be higher than estimat ed compared to the base reserve, for which the model is not intended to account. We refer to this additional liability as the provision for moderately adverse conditions. The provision for moderately adverse conditions is a component of our overall determination of the adequacy of our IBNR reserve. The provision for moderately adverse conditions is intended to capture the potential adverse development from factors such as our entry into new geographical markets, our provision of services to new populations such as the aged, blind and disabled, the variations in utilization of benefits and increasing medical cost, changes in provider reimbursement arrangements, variations in claims processing speed and patterns, claims payment, the severity of claims, and outbreaks of disease such as the flu. Because of the complexity of our business, the number of states in which we operate, and the need to account for different health care benefit packages among those states, we make an overall assessment of IBNR after cons idering the base actuarial model reserves and the provision for moderately adverse conditions. We consistently apply our IBNR estimation methodology from period to period. We review our overall estimates of IBNR on a monthly basis. As additional information becomes known to us, we adjust our assumptions accordingly to change our estimate of IBNR. Therefore, if moderately adverse conditions do not occur, evidenced by more complete claims information in the following period, then our prior period estimates will be revised downward, resulting in favorable development. However, any favorable prior period reserve development would affect (increase) current period net income only to the extent that the current period provision for moderately adverse conditions is less than the benefit recognized from the prior period favorable development. If moderately adverse conditions occur and are more than we estimated, then our prior period estimates will be revised upward, resulting in unfavorable development, which w ould decrease current period net income. In addition to the release of the provision for moderately adverse conditions, medical benefits expense for the year ended December 31, 2010, was impacted by approximately $56.2 million of net favorable development related to prior years. For the year ended December 31, 2009, medical benefits expense was impacted by approximately $58.7 million of net favorable development related to prior years. A significant portion of the net favorable prior year development in 2010 is associated with the exit of our PFFS product on December 31, 2009. The net amount of prior period developments in the 2009 periods was primarily attributable to pricing assumptions, early durational effect favorability, the volatility associated with our new and small blocks of MA business, whi ch were converted from the loss ratio methodology to the development factor methodology in 2009 (both methodologies are recognized methods for estimating claim reserves in accordance with actuarial standards of practice), the recovery by us of claim overpayments on our PFFS product that exceeded our estimates and better than expected demographic mix of membership. The factors impacting the changes in the determination of medical benefits payable discussed above were not discernable in advance. The impact became clearer over time as claim payments were processed and more complete claims information was obtained. Medical benefits payable includes reserves for claims adjudicated, but not yet paid, an estimate of claims incurred but not reported, reserves for medically-related administrative costs and other liabilities, including estimates for provider settlements due to clarification of contract terms, out-of-network reimbursement, claims payment differences and amounts due to contracted providers under risk-sharing arrangements. The following table provides a reconciliation of the beginning and ending balance of medical benefits payable for the following periods: Year Ended December 31, 2010 2009 2008 (In millions) Balances as of beginning of period $ 802.5 $ 766.2 $ 538.1 Medical benefits incurred related to: Current period 4,652.9 5,983.5 5,538.2 Prior periods (116.3 ) (121.0 ) (8.0 ) Total 4,536.6 5,862.5 5,530.2 Medical benefits paid related to: Current period (4,026.3 ) (5,250.9 ) (4,848.4 ) Prior periods (569.8 ) (575.3 ) (453.7 ) Total (4,596.1 ) (5,826.2 ) (5,302.1 ) Balances as of end of period $ 743.0 $ 802.5 $ 766.2 Changes in medical benefits payable estimates are primarily the result of obtaining more complete claims information and medical expense trend data over time. Differences in our financial statements between actual experience and estimates used to establish the liability, which we refer to as prior period developments, are recorded in the period when such differences become known, and have the effect of increasing or decreasing the reported medical benefits expense and resulting MBR in such periods. 66 Table of Contents Medical benefits payable recorded at December 31, 2009, 2008 and 2007 developed favorably by approximately $116.3 million, $121.0 million and $8.0 million in 2010, 2009 and 2008, respectively. These prior period developments were primarily attributable to the release of the provision for moderately adverse conditions, which is included as part of the assumptions, and favorable variances between actual experience and key assumptions relating to trend factors and completion factors for claims incurred in prior years. The release of the provision for moderately adverse conditions was substantially offset by the provision for moderately adverse conditions established for claims incurred in the succeeding year. Accordingly, the change in the amount of the incurred claims related to prior years in the Medical benefits payable does not directly correspond to an increase in net income recognized during the period. We consistently recognize the actuarial best estimate of the ultimate medical benefits payable within a level of confidence, as required by actuarial standards of practice, which require that the medical benefits payable be adequate under moderately adverse conditions. As we establish the liability for each year, we ensure that our assumptions appropriately consider moderately adverse conditions. When a portion of the development related to the prior year incurred claims is offset by an increase determined appropriate to address moderately adverse conditions for the current year incurred claims, we do not consider that offset amount as having any impact on net income during the period. Goodwill and Intangible Assets We obtained goodwill and intangible assets as a result of the acquisitions of our subsidiaries. Goodwill represents the excess of the cost over the fair market value of net assets acquired. Intangible assets include provider networks, trademarks, state contracts, licenses and permits. Our intangible assets are amortized over their estimated useful lives ranging from approximately one to 26 years. We use a two-step process to review goodwill for impairment. The first step is a screen for potential impairment, and the second step measures the amount of impairment, if any. We review goodwill and intangible assets for potential impairment at least annually, or more frequently if events or changes in circumstances occur that may affect the estimated useful life or the recoverability of the remaining balance of goodwill or intangible assets. Events or changes in circumstances would include significant changes in membership, state funding, medical contracts and provider networks. We evaluate the potential impairment of goodwill and intangible assets using both the income and market approach. 0;In doing so, we must make assumptions and estimates, such as the discount factor and peer benchmarking, in estimating fair values. While we believe these assumptions and estimates are appropriate, other assumptions and estimates could be applied and might produce significantly different results. An impairment loss is recognized for goodwill and intangible assets if the carrying value of such assets exceeds its fair value. We select the second quarter of each year for our annual impairment test, which generally coincides with the finalization of federal and state contract negotiations and our initial budgeting process. Our annual impairment test was completed during the third quarter of 2010. We assessed the book value of goodwill and other intangible assets and have determined that the fair value of our goodwill exceeds its carrying value, and as a result, there were no indications of additional impairment testing required as of December 31, 2010. We evaluated the intangible assets used in our PFFS business, which primarily consisted of state licenses for the insurance companies that underwrote that line of business. As we continue to use these company licenses for other lines of business and the licenses have a market value, we determined that these assets were not impaired. Based on the general economic conditions and outlook during 2008, we performed an analysis of the underlying valuation of Goodwill at December 31, 2008. Upon reviewing the valuation results, we determined that the Goodwill associated with our Medicare reporting unit was fully impaired. The impairment to our Medicare reporting unit was due to, among other things, the anticipated operating environment resulting from regulatory changes and new health care legislation, and the resulting effects on our future membership trends. In 2008, we recorded goodwill impairment expense of $78.3 million, and a corresponding write-down to Goodwill to reflect its fair value as presented in the Consolidated Balance Sheet. Recently Adopted Accounting Standards In February 2010, the Financial Accounting Standards Board (the FASB ) issued authoritative guidance related to subsequent events. This standard updates subsequent event guidance, issued in May 2009, requiring reporting entities to provide the date through which subsequent event reviews occurred, which was in conflict with certain SEC requirements. Accordingly, the update to previously issued subsequent event guidance removes the requirement to disclose a date through which subsequent events have been evaluated. The adoption of this guidance did not have a material effect on our financial statements. In January 2010, the FASB issued authoritative guidance related to improving disclosures about fair value measurements. This standard requires reporting entities to make new disclosures about recurring or nonrecurring fair-value measurements including significant transfers into and out of Level 1 and Level 2 fair value measurements and information on purchases, sales, issuances and settlements on a gross basis in the reconciliation of Level 3 fair value measurements. This standard is effective for annual reporting periods beginning after December 15, 2009, except for Level 3 reconciliation disclosures which are effective for annual periods beginning after December 15, 2010. The adoption of this guidance did not have a material effect on our financial sta tements. 67 Table of Contents
