ITEM 7. MANAGEMENT S DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS OF FINANCIAL CONDITION AND RESULTS OF OPERATIONS RISKS ASSOCIATED WITH FORWARD-LOOKING STATEMENTS This and other sections of this Annual Report contain certain forward-looking statements within the meaning of Section 27A of the Securities Act of 1933, as amended, and Section 21E of the Securities Exchange Act of 1934, as amended, which are intended to be covered by the safe harbors created thereby. These statements include, but are not limited to, statements about anticipated growth rate of revenues and expenses, planned asset dispositions, disposition pricing, planned acquisition and developments, property financings, and expected interest rates. Although the Company believes that the assumptions underlying the forward-looking statements are reasonable, any of the assumptions could be inaccurate and, therefore, there can be no assurance that the forward-looking statements included in this report on Form 10-K will prove to be accurate. In light of the significant uncertainties inherent in the forward-looking statements included herein, the inclusion of such information should not be regarded as a representation by the Company or any other person that the objectives and plans of the Company will be achieved. The following are risks that the Company believes could cause results to differ from projected or forecasted results or could have a material adverse effect on the Company business. The Company ability to make distributions may be adversely affected by factors beyond its control The Company ability to generate sufficient cash flow in order to pay common dividends to its shareholders depends on its ability to generate funds from operations in excess of capital expenditure requirements and common dividends, and/or to have access to the markets for debt and equity financing. Funds from operations and the value of the Company properties may be less because of factors which are beyond the Company control. Such events or conditions could include: competition from other apartment communities; overbuilding of new apartment units or oversupply of available apartment units in the Company markets, which might adversely affect apartment occupancy or rental rates and/or require rent concessions in order to lease apartment units; increases in operating costs (including real estate taxes and insurance premiums) due to inflation and other factors, which may not be offset by increased rents; the Company inability to rent apartments on favorable economic terms; changes in governmental regulations and the related costs of compliance; changes in tax laws and housing laws including the enactment of rent control laws or other laws regulating multifamily housing; changes in interest rate levels and the availability of financing, which could lead renters to purchase homes (if interest rates decrease and home loans are more readily available) or increase the Company acquisition and operating costs (if interest rates increase and financing is less readily available); weakness in the overall economy which lowers job growth and the associated demand for apartment housing; decisions relating to the dispositions of assets by the Company Joint Ventures; and the relative illiquidity of real estate investments. Currently, the Company relies on external funding sources to fully fund the payment of distributions to shareholders at the current rate. While the Company has sufficient liquidity to permit distributions at current rates through additional borrowings, any significant and sustained deterioration in operations could result in the Company financial resources being insufficient to pay distributions to shareholders at the current rate, in which event the Company would be required to reduce the distribution rate. Any decline in the Company 17 funds from operations could adversely affect the Company ability to make distributions to its shareholders or to met its loan covenants and could have a material adverse effect on the Company stock price. Debt level and refinancing risk may adversely affect financial condition and operating results At December 31, 2004, the Company had total debt outstanding of $1.083 billion. Payments of principal and interest on borrowings may leave the Company with insufficient cash resources to operate the Communities or pay distributions required to be paid in order for the Company to maintain its qualification as a REIT. The Company currently intends to limit its total debt to approximately 60% of the undepreciated book value of its assets, although the Company charter and bylaws do not limit its debt levels. Circumstances may cause the Company to exceed that target from time to time. As of December 31, 2004, the Company ratio of debt to undepreciated book value was approximately 56%. The Company Board of Directors can modify this policy at any time which could allow the Company to become more highly leveraged and decrease its ability to make distributions to its shareholders. In addition, the Company must repay its debt upon maturity, and the inability to access debt or equity capital at attractive rates could adversely affect the Company financial condition and/or its funds from operations. Variable interest rates may adversely affect funds from operations At December 31, 2004, effectively $201.6 million of the Company debt bore interest at a variable rate and was not hedged by interest rate swaps or caps. An additional $50 million also bore interest at a variable rate at December 31, 2004, but was hedged by an interest rate swap that becomes operative in May 2005. In addition, the Company may incur additional debt in the future that also bears interest at variable rates. Variable-rate debt creates higher debt service requirements if market interest rates increase, which would adversely affect the Company funds from operations and the amounts available to pay distributions to shareholders. The Company $950 million secured credit facilities with Prudential Mortgage Capital, credit enhanced by Fannie Mae, are predominately floating rate facilities. The Company also has a $100 million credit facility with Freddie Mac which is a variable rate facility. These facilities represent the majority of the variable interest rates the Company was exposed to at December 31, 2004. Large portions of the interest rates on these facilities have been hedged by means of a number of interest rate swaps and caps. Upon the termination of these swaps and caps, the Company will be exposed to the risks of varying interest rates. Increasing real estate taxes and insurance costs may negatively impact financial condition Because the Company has substantial real estate holdings, the cost of real estate taxes and insuring its Communities is a significant component of expense. Real estate taxes and insurance premiums are subject to significant increases and fluctuations which can be widely outside of the control of the Company. If the costs associated with real estate taxes and insurance should rise, the Company financial condition could be negatively impacted and the Company ability to pay its dividend could be affected. CRITICAL ACCOUNTING POLICIES AND ESTIMATES The following discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations are based upon the Company consolidated financial statements, and the notes thereto, which have been prepared in accordance with U.S. generally accepted accounting principles. The preparation of these consolidated financial statements requires the Company to make a number of estimates and assumptions that affect the reported amounts and disclosures in the consolidated financial statements. On an ongoing basis, the Company evaluates its estimates and assumptions based upon historical experience and various other factors and circumstances. The Company believes that its estimates and assumptions are reasonable in the circumstances; however, actual results may differ from these estimates and assumptions. The Company believes that the estimates and assumptions that are most important to the portrayal of its financial condition and results of operations, in that they require the most subjective judgments, form the basis 18 of accounting policies deemed to be most critical. These critical accounting policies include capitalization of expenditures and depreciation of assets, impairment of long-lived assets, including goodwill, and fair value of derivative financial instruments. Capitalization of expenditures and depreciation of assets The Company carries its real estate assets at their depreciated cost. Depreciation is computed on a straight-line basis over the estimated useful lives of the related assets, which range from 8 to 40 years for land improvements and buildings, 5 years for furniture, fixtures, and equipment, and 3 to 5 years for computers and software, all of which are judgmental determinations. Repairs and maintenance costs are expensed as incurred while significant improvements, renovations, and replacements are capitalized. The cost to complete any deferred repairs and maintenance at properties acquired by the Company in order to elevate the condition of the property to the Company standards are capitalized as incurred. Impairment of long-lived assets, including goodwill The Company accounts for long-lived assets in accordance with the provisions of Statement No. 144, Accounting for the Impairment or Disposal of Long-Lived Assets ( Statement 144 ) and evaluates its goodwill for impairment under Statement No. 142, Goodwill and Other Intangible Assets ( Statement 142 ). The Company evaluates its goodwill for impairment on an annual basis in the Company fiscal fourth quarter, or sooner if a goodwill impairment indicator is identified. The Company periodically evaluates its long-lived assets, including its investments in real estate and goodwill, for indicators that would suggest that the carrying amount of the assets may not be recoverable. The judgments regarding the existence of such indicators are based on factors such as operating performance, market conditions, and legal factors. In accordance with Statement 144, long-lived assets, such as real estate assets, and equipment, and purchased intangibles subject to amortization, are reviewed for impairment whenever events or changes in circumstances indicate that the carrying amount of an asset may not be recoverable. Recoverability of assets to be held and used is measured by a comparison of the carrying amount of an asset to estimated undiscounted future cash flows expected to be generated by the asset. If the carrying amount of an asset exceeds its estimated future cash flows, an impairment charge is recognized by the amount by which the carrying amount of the asset exceeds the fair value of the asset. Assets to be disposed of are separately presented in the balance sheet and reported at the lower of the carrying amount or fair value less costs to sell, and are no longer depreciated. The assets and liabilities of a disposed group classified as held for sale are presented separately in the appropriate asset and liability sections of the balance sheet. Goodwill is tested annually for impairment, and is tested for impairment more frequently if events and circumstances indicate that the asset might be impaired. An impairment loss is recognized to the extent that the carrying amount exceeds the asset fair value. This determination is made at the reporting unit level and consists of two steps. First, the Company determines the fair value of a reporting unit and compares it to its carrying amount. In the apartment industry, the primary method used for determining fair value is to divide annual operating cash flows by an appropriate capitalization rate. The Company determines the appropriate capitalization rate by reviewing the prevailing rates in a property market or submarket. Second, if the carrying amount of a reporting unit exceeds its fair value, an impairment loss is recognized for any excess of the carrying amount of the reporting unit goodwill over the implied fair value of that goodwill. The implied fair value of goodwill is determined by allocating the fair value of the reporting unit in a manner similar to a purchase price allocation, in accordance with Statement No. 141, Business Combinations . The residual fair value after this allocation is the implied fair value of the reporting unit goodwill. Fair value of derivative financial instruments The Company utilizes certain derivative financial instruments, primarily interest rate swaps and caps, during the normal course of business to manage, or hedge, the interest rate risk associated with the Company variable rate debt or as hedges in anticipation of future debt transactions to manage well-defined interest rate 19 risk associated with the transaction. The valuation of the derivative financial instruments under Statement No. 133 as amended requires the Company to make estimates and judgments that affect the fair value of the instruments. In order for a derivative contract to be designated as a hedging instrument, the relationship between the hedging instrument and the hedged item must be highly effective. While the Company calculation of hedge effectiveness contains some subjective determinations, the historical correlation of the cash flows of the hedging instruments and the underlying hedged item are measured by the Company before entering into the hedging relationship and have been found to be highly correlated. The Company performs ineffectiveness tests using the change in the variable cash flows method at the inception of the hedge and for each reporting period thereafter, through the term of the hedging instruments. Any amounts determined to be ineffective are recorded in earnings. The change in fair value of the interest rate swaps and caps designated as cash flow hedges are recorded to accumulated other comprehensive income in the statement of shareholders equity. OVERVIEW OF THE YEAR ENDED DECEMBER 31, 2004 The Company results for 2004 were positively impacted by both internal and external growth. The Company achieved internal growth in 2004 as same store operating results were helped by early signs of economic recovery in the Company geographic areas of operation. Occupancy performance improved from the prior year, but was somewhat offset by a continued use of a higher than historical level of rental concessions. The Company grew externally during 2004 by following its acquisition strategy to invest in large and mid-sized growing markets in the southeastern United States and in Texas. The Company acquired six properties in 2004. The financings and acquisitions made during 2004 helped the Company continue its strategy of improving the flexibility of its balance sheet and enhancing its ability to strengthen its dividend coverage. The following is a discussion of the consolidated financial condition and results of operations of the Company for the years ended December 31, 2004, 2003, and 2002. This discussion should be read in conjunction with all of the consolidated financial statements included in this Annual Report on Form 10-K. As of December 31, 2004, the total number of apartment units the Company owned or had an ownership interest in, including the properties owned by the Company Joint Ventures was 37,904 in 132 Communities compared to the 35,734 apartment units in 127 Communities owned at December 31, 2003, and the 33,923 apartment units in 123 Communities owned at December 31, 2002. For properties owned 100% by the Company, the average monthly rental per apartment unit, excluding units in lease-up, increased to $680 at December 31, 2004 from $667 at December 31, 2003 and $661 at December 31, 2002. For these same units, overall occupancy at December 31, 2004, 2003 and 2002 was 93.6%, 92.7%, and 91.9%, respectively. RESULTS OF OPERATIONS COMPARISON OF THE YEAR ENDED DECEMBER 31, 2004 TO THE YEAR ENDED DECEMBER 31, 2003 Comparisons of income from property operations for the years ended December 31, 2004 and 2003 were impacted by various factors. As a result of the buyout in August of 2003 of the partnership interest in Bre/Maac Associates, LLC, (the BreMaac Buyout ), the Company joint venture with Blackstone Real Estate Advisors ( Blackstone ), the Company consolidated financial statements for 2003 include the impact of approximately only four months of operations of the 10 properties which were previously owned by the joint venture and accounted for using the equity method. The Company consolidated financial statements for 2004 include a full twelve months of operations for these 10 properties. The Company consolidated financial statements for 2003 also included only partial year results for the four properties acquired during 2003 (one of which was subsequently transferred to Mid-America CH/Realty, LP, the Company joint venture with Crow Holdings (the Green Oaks Transfer )). The Company also acquired an additional six properties during the 20 course of 2004. During 2003, the Company had two development communities which completed lease-up. Finally, the Company performance during 2004 and 2003 was impacted by changes in performance of the communities that were held throughout both periods. Property revenues for the year ended December 31, 2004, increased by approximately $31,262,000 from the year ended December 31, 2003 due to (i) a $12,481,000 increase in property revenues from the BreMaac Buyout, (ii) a $7,759,000 increase in property revenues from the six communities acquired in 2004 (the 2004 Acquisitions ), (iii) a $7,372,000 increase in property revenues from the acquisitions of the Los Rios Park, Lighthouse Court and Legacy Pines communities in 2003 (the 2003 Acquisitions ), (iv) a $4,062,000 increase in property revenues from the communities held throughout both periods, and (v) a $189,000 increase in property revenues from the communities in lease-up in 2003 (the Communities in Lease-up ). These increases were partially offset by a decrease in property revenues of $601,000 due to the Green Oaks Transfer. Property operating expenses include costs for property personnel, building repairs and maintenance, real estate taxes and insurance, utilities, landscaping and other property related costs. Property operating expenses for the year ended December 31, 2004, increased by approximately $14,056,000 from the year ended December 31, 2003, due primarily to increases of property operating expenses of (i) $6,008,000 from the BreMaac Buyout, (ii) $3,966,000 from the 2003 Acquisitions, (iii) $3,307,000 from the 2004 Acquisitions, (iv) $593,000 from the communities held throughout both periods, (v) $514,000 from expenses related to the extraordinary hurricane season in 2004, and (vi) $27,000 from the Communities in Lease-up. These increases were partially offset by a decrease in property operating expenses of $359,000 from the Green Oaks Transfer. Depreciation expense increased by approximately $10,579,000 primarily due to the increases of depreciation expense of (i) $3,659,000 from the 2003 Acquisitions, (ii) $3,362,000 from the 2004 Acquisitions, (iii) $2,781,000 from the BreMaac Buyout, and (iv) $802,000 from the communities held throughout both periods. These increases were partially offset by a decrease in depreciation expense of $25,000 from the Communities in Lease-up. Property management expenses increased by approximately $1,922,000 from the year ended December 31, 2003 to the year ended December 31, 2004 partially due to increased personnel expenses and incentive compensation related to property acquisitions. General and administrative expenses increased by approximately $2,005,000 over this same period partially related to expenses associated with the implementation of new property management software and expenses resulting from new regulatory requirements. Interest expense increased approximately $5,867,000 from 2003 due primarily to the increase in the amount of debt outstanding from 2003. The Company average borrowing cost at December 31, 2004 and 2003 was 5.4%. For the year ended December 31, 2004, the Company recorded a total of approximately $9,074,000 in gains from two property sales, of which approximately $3,249,000 represented the Company share of the gain from the sale of a property which was owned by one of the Company joint ventures. In 2003, the Company sold one property and recorded a gain of approximately $1,919,000. In 2004 and 2003, the Company refinanced the debt on several of its communities primarily to take advantage of the lower interest rate environment. This resulted in gains of approximately $1,095,000 and $111,000 related to the early extinguishment of debt in 2004 and 2003, respectively. For the years ended December 31, 2004, and 2003, the Company recorded net gains on insurance and other settlement proceeds totaling approximately $2,683,000, mainly related to insurance settlements from fires at some of the Company Communities, and approximately $2,860,000, mainly related to insurance settlements from the fire at the Company headquarters in March 2002, respectively. Primarily as a result of the foregoing, net income increased by $4,992,000 in 2004 over 2003. COMPARISON OF THE YEAR ENDED DECEMBER 31, 2003 TO THE YEAR ENDED DECEMBER 31, 2002 Comparisons of income from property operations for the years ended December 31, 2003 and 2002 were impacted by four main factors. First, as a result of the BreMaac Buyout the Company consolidated financial statements for 2003 include the impact of only four months of operations of the 10 properties which were 21 previously owned by the joint venture and accounted for using the equity method. Second, the Company acquired four properties in 2003 (one of which was subsequently transferred to Mid-America CH/Realty, LP, the Company joint venture with Crow Holdings). Third, during the years 2003 and 2002, the Company still had three development communities which were in various stages of lease-up (the Development Communities ). Finally, the Company performance during 2003 and 2002 was impacted by changes in performance of the communities that were held throughout both periods. Property revenues for 2003 increased by approximately $7,864,000 due primarily to increases of (i) $6,156,000 from the BreMaac Buyout, (ii) $3,841,000 from the 2003 Acquisitions and the purchase of the Green Oaks apartments, and (iii) $1,431,000 from the Development Communities. These increases were partially offset by a decrease in property revenues of $3,564,000 from the communities owned throughout both periods. Property operating expenses include costs for property personnel, building repairs and maintenance, real estate taxes and insurance, utilities, landscaping and other property related costs. Property operating expenses for 2003 increased by approximately $7,823,000 due primarily to increases of (i) $2,999,000 due to the BreMaac Buyout, (ii) $2,623,000 from the communities held throughout both periods, (iii) $1,908,000 due to the 2003 Acquisitions and the purchase of the Green Oaks apartments, and (iv) $293,000 due to the Development Communities. Depreciation and amortization expense increased by approximately $3,789,000 from the prior year primarily due to increases of (i) $2,304,000 due to the BreMaac Buyout, (ii) $1,460,000 due to the 2003 Acquisitions, (iii) $1,000 due to the communities owned throughout both periods and (iv) $24,000 from the Development Communities. Property management expenses decreased approximately $198,000 as compared to the prior year. The decrease was mainly due to reductions in bonuses. General and administrative expense increased approximately $570,000 as compared to the prior year. This increase was mainly related to increased compensation incentives and salaries, partially related to the addition of new personnel hired to address recent regulatory requirements. Interest expense decreased approximately $3,390,000 from 2002 due primarily to the Company ability to take advantage of the decline in interest rates in 2002 and 2003. The Company average borrowing cost at December 31, 2003 was 5.4% as compared to 5.8% on December 31, 2002. For the years ended December 31, 2003, and 2002, the Company recorded net gains on insurance and other settlement proceeds totaling approximately $2,860,000, mainly related to insurance settlements from the fire at the Company headquarters in March 2002, and approximately $397,000, primarily related to insurance settlements, respectively. In 2003 and 2002, the Company refinanced several of its communities primarily to take advantage of the lower interest rate environment. This resulted in a gain of approximately $111,000 related to the early extinguishment of debt in 2003 and a loss of approximately $1,441,000 in 2002. In 2003, the Company recorded a gain on discontinued operations of approximately $1,919,000 related to the sale of the Crossings apartments in 2003. No properties were sold in 2002. Primarily as a result of the foregoing, net income increased by approximately $4,065,000 in 2003 over 2002. FUNDS FROM OPERATIONS Funds from operations ( FFO ) represents net income (computed in accordance with U.S. generally accepted accounting principles, or GAAP ) excluding extraordinary items, minority interest in Operating Partnership income, gain on disposition of real estate assets, plus depreciation of real estate, and adjustments for joint ventures to reflect FFO on the same basis. This definition of FFO is in accordance with the National Association of Real Estate Investment Trust ( NAREIT ) definition. Disposition of real estate assets includes sales of discontinued operations as well as proceeds received from insurance and other settlements from property damage. 22 In response to the Securities and Exchange Commission Staff Policy Statement relating to EITF Topic D-42 concerning the calculation of earnings per share for the redemption of preferred stock, the Company has included the amount charged to retire preferred stock in excess of carrying values in its FFO calculation. The Company policy is to expense the cost of interior painting, vinyl flooring, and blinds as incurred for stabilized properties. During the stabilization period for acquisition properties, these items are capitalized as part of the total repositioning program of newly acquired properties, and, thus are not deducted in calculating FFO. FFO should not be considered as an alternative to net income or any other GAAP measurement of performance, as an indicator of operating performance or as an alternative to cash flow from operating, investing, and financing activities as a measure of liquidity. The Company believes that FFO is helpful to investors in understanding the Company operating performance in that such calculation excludes depreciation expense on real estate assets. The Company believes that GAAP historical cost depreciation of real estate assets is generally not correlated with changes in the value of those assets, whose value does not diminish predictably over time, as historical cost depreciation implies. The Company calculation of FFO may differ from the methodology for calculating FFO utilized by other REITs and, accordingly, may not be comparable to such other REITs. The following table is a reconciliation of FFO to net income for the years ended December 31, 2004, 2003 and 2002 (dollars and shares in thousands): Years ended December 31, 2004 2003 2002 Net income $ 25,198 $ 20,206 $ 16,141 Depreciation real estate assets 67,302 56,701 52,928 Net gain on insurance and other settlement proceeds (2,683 ) (2,860 ) (397 ) Gain on disposition within unconsolidated entities (3,249 ) Net gain on insurance and other settlement proceeds of discontinued operations (526 ) (82 ) Depreciation real estate assets of discontinued operations 681 1,022 978 Gain on sale of discontinued operations (5,825 ) (1,919 ) Depreciation real estate assets of unconsolidated entities 1,688 2,345 1,430 Gain on sale of non-depreciable assets (45 ) Preferred dividend distribution (14,825 ) (15,419 ) (16,029 ) Minority interest in operating partnership income 2,264 1,360 388 Premiums and original issuance costs associated with the redemption of preferred stock (5,987 ) (2,041 ) Funds from operations $ 70,025 $ 55,367 $ 53,353 Weighted average shares and units: Basic 22,981 21,093 20,415 Diluted 23,316 21,354 20,613 FFO increased during 2004 by approximately $14,658,000 to $70,025,000 versus $55,367,000 in 2003 principally because of the addition of properties through the BreMaac Buyout and 2003 and 2004 Acquisitions as previously reviewed in the net income discussion above. FFO for 2002 was $53,353,000. FFO for 2003 and 2002 included charges of $5,987,000 and $2,041,000, respectively, for premiums and original issuance costs associated with the redemption of preferred stock. TRENDS Property performance over the past two years has been pressured by an imbalance between supply and demand for apartment units in many of the Company markets. The economic downturn and the related low interest rate environment have combined to contribute to a temporary decline in demand for apartment units, while allowing delivery levels of newly constructed apartment units to remain consistent with and in some cases above historical averages. 23 The recent economic environment has impacted demand in two main ways: 1) producing lower job growth, which reduced the number of potential renters in most of the Company markets, and 2) producing lower interest rates which has increased the affordability of single family housing, prompting more renters to purchase homes. On the supply side, the declining interest rates have provided an incentive to developers to construct new apartment units in many of the Company markets, especially in the larger metropolitan markets. Delivery of these new units during this period of weakened apartment demand has increased competition, adding pressure to apartment occupancy levels and pricing in a number of the Company markets. As part of its strategy to create continued stable and growing performance, the Company maintains a portfolio of properties diversified across large metropolitan markets, mid-sized markets, and smaller tier markets, as defined by population levels. During the economic downturn, the Company smaller-tier and mid-sized markets produced more stable performance, while its larger metropolitan markets proved more susceptible to declining job formation and apartment supply imbalances. The Company is beginning to see indications of stronger job growth in many of its markets, which could indicate an improvement in the general economic environment. As (and if) the economic environment improves, the Company expects to see more household formations and increasing interest rates, which the Company believes will combine to increase the number of apartment renters and decrease the construction of new apartment units. While increasing interest rates will increase the Company cost of borrowing, the Company expects that this increase in demand will also generate stronger property performance across the Company portfolio. The Company large-tier markets, which have been under the most pressure during the economic downturn, should begin to absorb the oversupply of new apartment units and return to historical occupancy and pricing levels, while the Company smaller-tier and mid-sized markets will also benefit from improving market fundamentals which support continued stable growth. Over the long term, general demographic trends are expected to favor apartment owners, as immigration growth, combined with the increasing demand for rental housing from the echo boomers (children of the baby boomers ) is expected to produce more apartment renters over the next ten years. The Company believes its portfolio location throughout the Southeast and South central regions of the country position it well to take advantage of these improving demographic trends. LIQUIDITY AND CAPITAL RESOURCES Net cash flow provided by operating activities increased by approximately $11,709,000 to $88,229,000 for 2004 compared to $76,520,000 for 2003 mainly related to the growth of the Company through the BreMaac Buyout and the 2003 Acquisitions and 2004 Acquisitions. Net cash used in investing activities remained relatively stable, increasing from approximately $139,555,000 in 2003 to $168,383,000 in 2004. A total of approximately $138,688,000 was invested in 2003 to acquire properties (including the BreMaac Buyout), this compares to approximately $155,088,000 in 2004. These amounts were only slightly offset by proceeds from dispositions of assets of approximately $26,247,000 in 2003 and $15,679,000 in 2004. Capital improvements to existing real estate assets during 2004 and 2003 totaled approximately $30,413,000 and $22,832,000, respectively. Recurring capital expenditures were approximately $13,012,000 and $12,846,000, respectively during 2004 and 2003. Net cash provided by financing activities increased approximately $18,812,000 to $80,492,000 in 2004 from $61,680,000 in 2003. Cash provided from financing activities from credit lines and notes payable increased approximately $58,839,000 from 2003 to 2004 as the Company took advantage of refinancing opportunities to manage interest expense and help accommodate property acquisitions. Proceeds from issuances of common shares and units decreased approximately $34,628,000 from 2003 to 2004 as the Company sold 1,765,000 shares of common stock to certain advisory clients of Cohen & Steers Capital Management, Inc. and to Scudder RREEF Real Estate Fund II, Inc. in 2003 to partially 24 fund the BreMaac Buyout and acquisitions in 2003. In 2004 the Company issued approximately 414,000 shares of common stock through its Direct Stock Purchase and Distribution Reinvestment Plan as compared to 31,484 shares in 2003, as the Company granted a total of $15 million in waivers for purchases from August 2004 to December 2004. In the first three months of 2004, the Company refinanced $2.3 million of bonds using its secured credit facility with a group of banks led by AmSouth Bank (the AmSouth Facility ). The Company refinanced an additional $14.3 million of bonds using its tax-free bond facility, credit enhanced by the Federal National Mortgage Association ( FNMA ) (the Tax-Free Bond Facility ). The Company also refinanced a total of $52.8 million representing the debt on six of the properties it acquired through its partnership buyout of Bre/Maac Associates, LLC in 2003 using a renegotiated secured credit facility with Prudential Mortgage Capital, credit enhanced by FNMA (the FNMA Facility ). During the three month period ended June 30, 2004, the Company refinanced an $11.2 million mortgage using its existing FNMA Facility. The Company amended the AmSouth Facility to extend the maturity by one year and increased the loan to value from 57% to 65%, effectively increasing the borrowing base from $31.7 million to $37.9 million. The Company also paid off the mortgages of five properties. The five properties were then used to collateralize a loan under a new credit agreement with Financial Federal Savings Bank, which was subsequently purchased and credit enhanced by Freddie Mac (the Freddie Mac Facility ). The Freddie Mac Facility has a commitment amount of $100 million and a maturity date of July 1, 2011. During the three month period ended September 30, 2004, the Company refinanced the debt on the remaining four properties it acquired through its partnership buyout of Bre/Maac Associates, LLC in 2003 using the FNMA Facility. The Company also borrowed a total of $31 million from its Freddie Mac Facility in the third quarter of 2004 which is collateralized by the Watermark and Prescott apartments purchased in 2004. During the three month period ended December 31, 2004, the Company paid off the individual mortgages of five properties using its FNMA Facility. The Company also used the FNMA Facility to pay off loans maturing on three properties with Prudential totaling $47.5 million. At December 31, 2004, the Tax-Free Bond Facility and the FNMA Facility (together the FNMA Facilities ) had a combined credit line limit of $950 million, $839 million of which was available to borrow. The FNMA Facilities have multiple maturity traunches that range from 2010 through 2014. The FNMA Facilities provide for both fixed and variable rate borrowings. The interest rate on the majority of the variable portion renews every 90 days and is based on the FNMA Discount Mortgage Backed Security ( DMBS ) rate on the date of renewal, which has typically approximated three-month LIBOR less an average spread of 0.04% over the life of the FNMA Facilities, plus a credit enhancement fee of 0.62%. Each of the Company credit facilities is subject to various covenants and conditions on usage. If the Company were to fail to satisfy a condition to borrowing, the available credit under one or more of the facilities could not be drawn, which could adversely affect the Company liquidity. Moreover, if the Company were to fail to make a payment or violate a covenant under a credit facility, after applicable cure periods one or more of its lenders could declare a default, accelerate the due date for repayment of all amounts outstanding and/or foreclose on properties securing such facilities. Any such event could have a material adverse effect on the Company. The Company uses interest rate swaps to manage its current and future interest rate risk. As of December 31, 2004, the Company had 23 interest rate swaps in effect with a total notional amount of $519 million. These swaps have to date proven to be highly effective hedges. The Company has also entered into a future interest rate swap which will go into effect in the second quarter of 2005. The Company had three interest rate cap agreements in effect as of December 31, 2004, representing a total notional amount of $22.6 million. 25 The weighted average interest rate at December 31, 2004, for the $1.083 billion of debt outstanding was 5.4% compared to 5.4% on $952 million of debt outstanding at December 31, 2003.

The net proceeds of the sale were applied to the redemption of all the issued and outstanding shares of the Company 9.5% Series A Cumulative Preferred Stock and 9-3/8% Series C Cumulative Redeemable Preferred Stock as well as 1,600,000 shares of the 1,938,830 issued and outstanding shares of the Company 8-7/8% Series B Cumulative Preferred Stock ( Series B ) on August 12, 2003. On July 16, 2003, the underwriters of the Company Series H offering exercised an option to purchase an additional 525,000 shares of the Series H preferred stock for $25 per share less the underwriting discount, and on August 4, 2003, the underwriters exercised an option to purchase the remaining additional 75,000 shares of the Series H preferred stock for $25 per share less the underwriting discount. The net proceeds were used to redeem the remaining issued and outstanding shares of the Series B preferred stock on August 18, 2003. On August 22, 2003, the Company sold 700,000 shares of its common stock to certain advisory clients of Cohen & Steers Capital Management, Inc. The stock was sold at a price of $28.40 per share. The $19,870,000 in net proceeds from the sale were used to partially fund the BreMaac Buyout. On September 19, 2003, the Company sold 665,000 shares of its common stock to certain advisory clients of Cohen & Steers Capital Management, Inc. and to Scudder RREEF Real Estate Fund II, Inc. The stock was sold at a price of $29.36 per share. The $19,500,000 in net proceeds from the sale were used to partially fund the purchase of the Los Rios Park apartments. On December 2, 2003, the Company sold 400,000 shares of its common stock to RREEF America, L.L.C. on behalf of itself and Scudder RREEF Real Estate Fund II, Inc. The stock was sold at a price of $30.00 per share. The $11,996,000 in net proceeds from the sale were used to partially fund the acquisition of the Lighthouse Court apartments. The Company believes that it has adequate resources to fund its current operations, annual refurbishment of its properties, and incremental investment in new apartment properties. The Company is relying on the efficient operation of the financial markets to finance debt maturities, and also is heavily reliant on the creditworthiness of FNMA, which provides credit enhancement for approximately $785 million of the Company debt. The interest rate market for FNMA DMBS, which in the Company experience is highly correlated with threemonth LIBOR interest rates, is also an important component of the Company liquidity and interest rate swap effectiveness. In the event that the FNMA DMBS market becomes less efficient, or the credit of FNMA becomes impaired, the Company would seek alternative sources of debt financing. For the year ended December 31, 2004, the Company net cash provided by operating activities was approximately $10.7 million short of funding improvements to existing real estate assets, distributions to unitholders, and dividends paid on common and preferred shares. This compared to a shortfall of approximately $9.5 million for the same period in 2003. While the Company has sufficient liquidity to permit distributions at current rates through additional borrowings, if necessary, any significant deterioration in operations could result in the Company financial resources to be insufficient to pay distributions to shareholders at the current rate, in which event the Company would be required to reduce the distribution rate. 27 The following table reflects the Company total contractual cash obligations which consists of its long-term debt as of December 31, 2004 (dollars in 000 s): Payments Due by Period Contractual Obligations 2005 2006 2007 2008 2009 Thereafter Total Long-Term Debt (1) $ 23,954 $ 20,816 $ 4,199 $ 85,165 $ 41,640 $ 907,699 $ 1,083,473 Capital Lease Operating Lease Purchase Obligations Other Long-Term Liabilities Reflected on the Registrant Balance Sheet under GAAP Total $ 23,954 $ 20,816 $ 4,199 $ 85,165 $ 41,640 $ 907,699 $ 1,083,473 (1) Represents principal payments. OFF-BALANCE SHEET ARRANGEMENTS At December 31, 2004 and 2003, the Company did not have any relationships with unconsolidated entities or financial partnerships, such as entities often referred to as structured finance or special purpose entities, established for the purpose of facilitating off-balance sheet arrangements or other contractually narrow or limited purposes. The Company joint venture with Blackstone (terminated in 2003) was established in order to raise capital through asset sales to fund development (while acquiring management fees to help offset the reduction in FFO from the sale), share repurchases, and other capital requirements. The Company joint ventures with Crow Holdings were established to acquire approximately $200 million of multifamily properties. In addition, the Company does not engage in trading activities involving non-exchange traded contracts. As such, the Company is not materially exposed to any financing, liquidity, market, or credit risk that could arise if it had engaged in such relationships. The Company does not have any relationships or transactions with persons or entities that derive benefits from their non-independent relationships with the Company or its related parties other than what is disclosed in Item 8. Financial Statements and Supplementary Data Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements, Note 11. The Company investments in its real estate joint ventures are unconsolidated and are recorded on the equity method as the Company does not have a controlling interest. The Company has a mezzanine loan in the amount of $4.5 million at an average rate of 9% receivable from its joint venture, Mid-America CH/Realty, LP. INSURANCE The Company put in place a new property and casualty insurance policy effective July 1, 2004. The policy is substantially the same as last year. In the opinion of management, property and casualty insurance is in place that provides adequate coverage to provide financial protection against normal insurable risks such that it believes that any loss experienced would not have a significant impact on the Company liquidity, financial position, or results of operations. INFLATION Substantially all of the resident leases at the Communities allow, at the time of renewal, for adjustments in the rent payable there under, and thus may enable the Company to seek rent increases. Almost all leases are for one year or less. The short-term nature of these leases generally serves to reduce the risk to the Company of the adverse effects of inflation. IMPACT OF RECENTLY ISSUED ACCOUNTING STANDARDS In December 2004, the FASB issued Statement No. 123 (revised December 2004), Share-Based Payment ( Statement 123(R) ). Statement 123(R) replaces FASB Statement No. 123, Accounting for Stock-Based Compensation, and supersedes APB Opinion No. 25, Accounting for Stock Issued to Employees. Statement 28 123(R) will require compensation costs related to share-based payment transactions to be recognized in the financial statements. With limited exceptions, the amount of compensation cost will be measured based on the grant-date fair value of the equity or the liability instruments issued. In addition, liability awards will be remeasured each reporting period. Compensation cost will be recognized over the period that an employee provides service in exchange for the award. Statement 123(R) is effective as of the beginning of the first interim reporting period that begins after June 15, 2005. The Company does not believe the adoption of Statement 123(R) will have a material impact on the Company consolidated financial condition or results of operations taken as a whole. In December 2004, the FASB issued Statement No. 152, Accounting for Real Estate Time-Sharing Transactions, an amendment of FASB Statements No. 66 and 67 ( Statement 152 ). Statement 152 amends FASB Statement No. 66, Accounting for Sales of Real Estate, to reference the financial accounting and reporting guidance for real estate time-sharing transactions that is provided in AICPA Statement of Position (SOP) 04-2, Accounting for Real Estate Time-Sharing Transactions. Statement 152 also amends FASB Statement No. 67, Accounting for Costs and Initial Rental Operations of Real Estate Projects, to state that the guidance for (a) incidental operations and (b) costs incurred to sell real estate projects does not apply to real estate time-sharing transactions. The accounting for those operations and costs is subject to the guidance in SOP 04-2. Statement 152 is effective for financial statements for fiscal years beginning after June 15, 2005. The Company does not believe the adoption of Statement 152 will have a material impact on the Company consolidated financial condition or results of operations taken as a whole. In December 2004, the FASB issued Statement No. 153, Exchanges of Nonmonetary Assets, an amendment of APB Opinion No. 29 ( Statement 153 ). Statement 153 was a result of a joint effort by the FASB and the IASB to improve financial reporting by eliminating certain narrow differences between their existing accounting standards. Statement 153 amends APB Opinion No. 29 to eliminate the exception for nonmonetary exchanges of similar productive assets and replaces it with a general exception for exchanges of nonmonetary assets that do not have commercial substance. A nonmonetary exchange has commercial substance if the future cash flows of the entity are expected to change significantly as a result of the exchange. Statement 153 shall be applied prospectively and is effective for nonmonetary asset exchanges occurring in fiscal periods beginning after June 15, 2005. The Company does not believe the adoption of Statement 153 will have a material impact on the Company consolidated financial condition or results of operations taken as a whole.
