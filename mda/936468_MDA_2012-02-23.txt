ITEM 7. MANAGEMENT S DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS OF FINANCIAL CONDITION AND RESULTS OF OPERATIONS Management Overview We are a global security and aerospace company principally engaged in the research, design, development, manufacture, integration, and sustainment of advanced technology systems and products. We also provide a broad range of management, engineering, technical, scientific, logistic, and information services. We serve both domestic and international customers with products and services that have defense, civil, and commercial applications, with our principal customers being agencies of the U.S. Government. In 2011, 82% of our $46.5 billion in net sales were from the U.S. Government, either as a prime contractor or as a subcontractor (including 61% from the Department of Defense (DoD)), 17% were from international customers (including foreign military sales (FMS) funded, in whole or in part, by the U.S. Government), and 1% were from U.S. commercial and other customers. Our main areas of focus are in defense, space, intelligence, homeland security, and information technology, including cyber security. We have four business segments: Aeronautics, Electronic Systems, Information Systems & Global Solutions (IS&GS), and Space Systems. We organize our business segments based on the nature of the products and services offered. We are operating in an environment that is characterized by both increasing complexity in the global security environment, as well as continuing economic pressures in the U.S. and globally. A significant component of our strategy in this environment is to focus on core program execution, improving the quality and predictability of the delivery of our products and services, and placing more security capability into the hands of our customers at affordable prices. Recognizing that our U.S. Government customers are resource constrained, we are endeavoring to develop and extend our portfolio in a disciplined manner with a focus on international and adjacent markets. Finally, we are focused on cost reduction, through actions such as our workforce reductions in 2011 and programs like our Voluntary Executive Separation Program (VESP) and facility reduction initiatives in 2010, to further enhance the value of our products and services. We expect a slight decline in our 2012 consolidated net sales and segment operating profit as compared to 2011, as our customers prepare to meet new security challenges without the benefit of increased resources. Our 2012 segment operating margin is expected to remain above 11%. Despite the challenges we face, we have a strong balance sheet and we expect to generate strong operating cash flows, which will allow us to continue to invest in technologies to fulfill new mission requirements for our customers, invest in our people so that we have the professional and leadership skills necessary to be successful in this environment, and to return at least 50% of free cash flow 1 to investors in the form of share repurchases and dividends. Industry Considerations U.S. Government Business Budget Priorities The U.S. Government continues to focus on developing and implementing spending, tax, and other initiatives to stimulate the economy, create jobs, and reduce the deficit. The Administration is attempting to balance decisions regarding defense, homeland security, and other federal spending priorities in a greatly constrained fiscal environment imposed by the enactment of the Budget Control Act of 2011 (Budget Act), which reduces defense spending by $487 billion over a ten-year period starting in fiscal year 2012. Absent a significant redress of the structural disconnect between revenues and expenditures that can only be addressed through major tax and mandatory spending program reforms, it is likely that discretionary spending by the federal government will remain constrained for several years. Although some specific priorities and initiatives may change from year to year, the investments and acquisitions we have made have been focused on aligning our businesses to address what we believe are the most critical national priorities and mission areas. The possibility remains, however, that one or more of our programs could be reduced, extended, or terminated as a result of the Administration continuing assessment of priorities. Notably, should Congress and the Administration fail to change or delay a pending sequestration of appropriations in fiscal year 2013 imposed by the Budget Act, our customers could see their budgets 1 We define free cash flow as cash from operations as determined under U.S. generally accepted accounting principles (GAAP), less the amount identified as expenditures for property, plant and equipment and capitalized internal-use software as presented on our Statements of Cash Flows. 22 Table of Contents dramatically reduced across the board in January 2013 with an attendant impact upon procurement of products and services. While the impact of sequestration is yet to be determined, automatic across-the-board budget cuts would approximately double the amount of the ten-year $487 billion top line reduction already reflected in the defense funding over a ten-year period, with a $52 billion reduction occurring in the government fiscal year 2013. The resulting automatic across-the-board budget cuts in sequestration would have significant consequences to our business and industry. There would be disruption of ongoing programs and initiatives, facilities closures and personnel reductions that would severely impact advanced manufacturing operations and engineering expertise, and accelerate the loss of skills and knowledge, directly undermining a key provision of the new security strategy, which is to preserve the industrial base. The Administration spending priorities were released on February 13, 2012 with the submission of the President Budget Request for fiscal year 2013. The government 2013 fiscal year runs from October 2012 to September 2013. Every year, Congress must approve or revise the proposals contained in the President annual budget request through enactment of appropriations bills and other policy legislation, which then require final Presidential approval. The outcome of the federal budget process has a direct effect on our business. Department of Defense Business The passage of the Budget Act signaled the end of ten years of growth in the DoD base budget and imposed specific caps on security and non-security spending beginning in fiscal year 2013. The fiscal year 2013 request of $525 billion for the DoD base budget is the first to reflect the reduced spending levels imposed by the Budget Act and is consistent with its caps on discretionary spending. The fiscal year 2013 request represents a decline of about 1% below the fiscal year 2012 DoD baseline appropriated level of $531 billion. Preliminary insights into national security funding priorities for fiscal year 2013 and beyond were revealed on January 26, 2012 by Secretary of Defense Leon Panetta, which were consistent with the fiscal year 2013 budget request. Specifically, the defense spending proposal estimates DoD base budgets that are essentially flat in real terms from fiscal year 2013 through fiscal year 2017. In prior years, the Administration has requested and Congress has provided funds for U.S. military operations in Afghanistan and Iraq, and other unforeseeable contingency or peacekeeping operations, through a separate Overseas Contingency Operations (OCO) funding outside of the base DoD budget. The OCO funding for fiscal year 2012 totaled $115 billion, and the Administration has requested $88 billion for fiscal year 2013. This significant reduction reflects the completion of U.S. military operations in Iraq in 2011. Our net sales historically have not been significantly dependent on overseas contingency or supplemental funding requests, and therefore, we continue to focus our attention on the DoD base budget for support and funding of our programs. In December 2011, Congress passed an omnibus appropriations act for fiscal year 2012 to finance all U.S. Government activities through September 30, 2012, the end of its fiscal year. This full year method of financing eliminated much of the uncertainty and inefficiency in procurement of products and services that characterized the first quarter of the government fiscal year 2012 when the operations of the federal government were financed through a series of continuing resolution temporary funding measures. As we begin 2012, presidential election year activities will likely mean a shortened session for Congress that will have to address the annual spending bills but also broader and more contentious policy issues associated with sequestration and tax policy. Given the complexity and sensitivity of these issues, Congress may resort to returning for a lame duck session after the November 2012 elections in order to deal with these more contentious issues. The fiscal year 2013 budget proposal reflects the Administration new national security strategy and is consistent with the lower spending levels imposed by the Budget Act. Despite the reduced defense spending levels in the President fiscal year 2013 budget proposal, we believe our broad mix of programs and capabilities continue to position us favorably to support the current and future needs of the DoD and our programs are well supported in the fiscal year 2013 budget request. This view was strongly supported by the Secretary of Defense initial public release of elements of the fiscal year 2013 defense budget request on January 26, 2012. For example, the budget supports continuation of all three variants of the F-35 and still maintains the same ultimate inventory objective of 2,443 aircraft for the U.S. Government as last year, although ramp up of production will be slowed due to budgetary constraints in the near term to allow for more testing and to minimize design changes impacting production aircraft. Additionally, the Secretary preliminary release specifically cited continued support for systems where we are the prime contractor or a major subcontractor such as the Global Positioning Satellite program, the Advanced Extremely High Frequency system, the Space-Based Infrared System, Phased Adaptive Approach missile defense system, DDG-51 AEGIS destroyer, and continued operation of the U-2 manned ISR aircraft. 23 Table of Contents Given the Administration emphasis on affordability and the need to find further efficiencies in the management and operations of DoD, the need for more affordable logistics and sustainment, expansive use of information technology and knowledge-based solutions, and vastly improved levels of network and cyber security, all appear to continue to be national priorities. To address these priorities, we continue to focus on growing our portfolio in these areas, diversifying our business, and expanding into adjacent businesses and programs that include surface naval vessels, rotary wing aviation, and land vehicles. Our products are represented in almost every aspect of land, sea, air, and space-based missile defense, including the Aegis Combat System, the Patriot Advanced Capability-3 (PAC-3) missile program, and the Terminal High Altitude Area Defense (THAAD) transportable defensive missile system. Even as future quantities may be adjusted to reflect reduced government resources for defense, we continue to perform on contracts to develop and deliver essential munitions, missile, and other systems, such as Hellfire, Javelin, Guided Multiple Launch Rocket Systems, and Q-53 (formerly EQ-36) radar systems, and the Persistent Threat Detection System (PTDS). We also have unmanned systems capabilities, including air, ground, and underwater systems. We have a significant presence in the support and modernization of the DoD information technology systems. We see opportunities for expansion of our sustainment and logistical support activities to enhance the longevity and cost-effectiveness of the systems procured by our customers, and for improving global supply chain management. Non-Department of Defense Business Our experience in the defense arena, together with our core information technology and services expertise, has enabled us to provide products and services to a number of government agencies, including the Departments of Homeland Security, Justice, Commerce, Health and Human Services, Transportation, and Energy, the U.S. Postal Service, the Social Security Administration, the Federal Aviation Administration, the National Aeronautics and Space Administration (NASA), and the Environmental Protection Agency (EPA). As with the DoD, all other departments and agencies were impacted by the Budget Act. For fiscal year 2013 there is a separate non-security discretionary spending cap applied to all non-DoD entities that were not included under the security cap. The result would be that budgets for fiscal year 2013 and beyond will be reduced further below last year estimates. We have continued to expand our capabilities in critical intelligence, knowledge management, and e-Government solutions for our customers, including the Social Security Administration and the Centers for Medicare and Medicaid Services (CMS). We also provide program management, business strategy and consulting, complex systems development and maintenance, complete life-cycle software support, information assurance, and enterprise solutions. We believe that there will be continued demand by federal and civil government agencies for upgrading and investing in new information technology systems and solutions in order to reduce costs of operations, but at a slower pace in the near term. Consistent with our DoD business, more affordable logistics and sustainment, a more expansive use of information technology and knowledge-based solutions, and improved levels of network and cyber security all appear to be priorities in our non-DoD business as well. Homeland security, critical infrastructure protection, and improved service levels for civil government agencies also appear to be high customer priorities. The continuing strong emphasis on homeland security may increase demand for our capabilities in areas such as air traffic management, ports, waterways and cargo security, biohazard detection systems for postal equipment, employee identification and credential verification systems, information systems security, and other global security systems solutions. Other Business Considerations International Business We remain committed to growth in our sales to international customers. We conduct business with foreign governments primarily through Aeronautics and Electronic Systems. Our international sales are comprised of FMS through the U.S. Government and direct commercial contracts. In Aeronautics, the U.S. Government and eight foreign government partners are working together on the design, testing, production, and sustainment of the F-35 Lightning II, while other countries such as Israel and Japan have selected the F-35 as their next generation combat aircraft. We expect the first international deliveries of the F-35 to begin in 2012. The F-16 Fighting Falcon has been selected by 26 customers worldwide, including recent orders from Iraq and Oman, with 54 follow-on buys from 15 countries. We continue to expand the C-130J Super Hercules air mobility aircraft international footprint with customers in 15 countries. In global sustainment, we are leveraging our value as the original equipment manufacturer (OEM) for our major platforms and have set up new production capabilities to provide service life extension, including new wings and support for the U.S., Norway, Canada, and Taiwan P-3 fleet. 24 Table of Contents With regard to the Aegis Combat System, our Electronic Systems segment performs activities in the development, production, ship integration and test, and lifetime support for ships of international customers such as Japan, Spain, Korea, Norway, and Australia. The system also has been selected to be used as a ground-based missile defense system in Europe, referred to as Aegis Ashore. This segment has contracts with the Canadian Government for the upgrade and support of combat systems on Halifax class frigates. The new Littoral Combat Ship (LCS) is also generating interest from potential international customers. Electronic Systems also produces the PAC-3 missile, an advanced defensive missile designed to intercept incoming airborne threats, for international customers including Japan, Germany, the Netherlands, Taiwan, and the United Arab Emirates (UAE). The UAE entered into a FMS agreement with the U.S. Government for the first international sale of the THAAD missile defense system, with other countries having expressed interest. In 2011, the Commonwealth of Australia entered into a FMS agreement for the first international sale of the MH-60R helicopter, for which we are responsible for integrating the common cockpit avionics suite, which marks the first ever purchase of an MH-60R helicopter outside of the U.S., and we also received an order to upgrade the United Kingdom Warrior fighting vehicles. To the extent our contracts and business arrangements with international partners include operations in foreign countries, other risks are introduced into our business, including changing economic conditions, fluctuations in relative currency values, regulation by foreign countries, and the potential for deterioration of political relations. Status of the F-35 Program The F-35 program consists of multiple contracts. Under our customer acquisition strategy, the System Development and Demonstration (SDD) contract will be performed concurrently with the Low Rate Initial Production (LRIP) contracts. Concurrent performance of development and production contracts is advantageous in complex programs to test airplanes, shorten the time to field systems, and achieve overall cost savings. Accordingly, we are performing the SDD contract concurrently with LRIP aircraft lots 2 through 6. The SDD portion of the F-35 program is expected to continue into 2017 and has approximately $530 million of fee remaining, only a minor portion of which has been tied to specific performance milestones to date. Any portion of the remaining fee that we or our partners receive will be dependent upon our customer evaluation of our progress on program milestones, most of which have yet to be determined by our customer. The current profit booking rate on the SDD contract contemplates that we will earn a portion of these outstanding award fees. Given the size and complexity of the F-35 program, we anticipate that there will be continual reviews related to aircraft quantities, program schedule, cost, and requirements as part of the DoD, Congressional, and international partners oversight and budgeting processes. Current program challenges include, but are not limited to, executing flight tests, supplier and partner performance, software development, and receiving funding for the LRIP contracts on a timely basis. In 2011, both of the LRIP lot 1 aircraft and seven of the 12 LRIP lot 2 aircraft were delivered to the U.S. Government. We received additional funding for LRIP 5 and long lead funding for LRIP 6 in 2011. We now have 93 production aircraft on order. Although not exclusively related to the F-35 program, on October 4, 2010, the Defense Contracting Management Agency (DCMA) withdrew its prior validation and determination of compliance of the earned value management system (EVMS) at our Fort Worth, Texas location. EVMS is a tool for managing cost and schedule performance on complex programs. We understand that the DCMA has chosen to re-audit our EVMS system in 2012. The withdrawal of the prior validation and determination of compliance of the EVMS system has no impact on our internal controls over financial reporting. In January 2012, the Secretary of Defense removed the short takeoff and vertical landing (STOVL) fighter variant from probation as the STOVL variant completed highly successful initial sea trials aboard the USS Wasp and is demonstrating the kind of performance and maturity that is in line with the other two variants of the F-35. International interest in the F-35 continues to grow with two U.S. Government FMS customers to go along with our eight partner countries. In 2011, the Israeli government signed a letter of offer and acceptance with the U.S. Government for the procurement of F-35 aircraft and the Japanese Ministry of Defense selected the F-35 to be its next generation fighter. Israel and Japan are expected to be the first two countries to receive the F-35 aircraft through the U.S. Government FMS process. 25 Table of Contents Portfolio Shaping Activities Overview We continuously strive to strengthen our portfolio of products and services to meet the current and future needs of our customers. We accomplish this in part by our independent research and development activities, and through acquisition, divestiture, and internal realignment activities. We selectively pursue the acquisition of businesses and investments that complement our current portfolio and allow access to new customers or technologies. We have made a number of niche acquisitions of businesses and investments in affiliates during the past several years. We also may explore the divestiture of businesses. In pursuing our business strategy, we routinely conduct discussions, evaluate targets, and enter into agreements regarding possible acquisitions, divestitures, joint ventures, and equity investments. As part of our business strategy, we seek to identify acquisition or investment opportunities that will expand or complement our existing products and services, or customer base, at attractive valuations. Acquisitions and Divestitures We used $649 million in 2011 for acquisition activities, including the acquisition of businesses and investments in affiliates. We have accounted for the acquisition of businesses under the acquisition method, which requires that all of the assets acquired and liabilities assumed be measured and recorded at their acquisition-date fair values. Acquisitions in 2011 primarily include QTC Holdings Inc. (QTC), which provides outsourced medical evaluation services to the U.S. Government, and Sim-Industries B.V., a commercial aviation simulation company. QTC is included within our IS&GS business segment, and Sim-Industries B.V. is included within our Electronic Systems business segment. The results of operations of these acquisitions have been included in the Statement of Earnings from the date of acquisition in the fourth quarter. During 2011, we committed to a plan to sell Savi Technology, Inc. (Savi), and we closed on the sale of Pacific Architects and Engineers, Inc. (PAE). In 2010, we closed on the sale of Enterprise Integration Group (EIG). For additional information, see Note 14 to the accompanying consolidated financial statements. Results of Operations Since our operating cycle is long-term and involves many types of design, development, and production (DD&P) contracts with varying production delivery schedules, the results of operations of a particular year, or year-to-year comparisons of recorded sales and profits, may not be indicative of future operating results. The following discussions of comparative results among periods should be viewed in this context. All per share amounts cited in these discussions are presented on a per diluted share basis from continuing operations, unless otherwise noted. (In millions, except per share data) 2011 2010 2009 Operating Results (a) Net sales $ 46,499 $ 45,671 $ 43,867 Cost of sales (42,795 ) (41,883 ) (39,720 ) Operating profit 3,980 4,049 4,367 Interest expense (354 ) (345 ) (308 ) Other non-operating income, net 5 74 123 Income tax expense (964 ) (1,164 ) (1,215 ) Net earnings from continuing operations 2,667 2,614 2,967 Net earnings (loss) from discontinued operations (12 ) 264 6 Net earnings 2,655 2,878 2,973 Diluted Earnings Per Common Share (a) Continuing operations $ 7.85 $ 7.10 $ 7.63 Discontinued operations (.04 ) .71 .01 Total $ 7.81 $ 7.81 $ 7.64 (a) The amounts in the above table reflect, as appropriate, the change in our accounting for services contracts with the U.S. Government from the services accounting method to the percentage-of-completion method (Note 1) and the operating results of Savi as discontinued operations (Note 14). All prior period amounts included in Management Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations have been adjusted to reflect these changes. 26 Table of Contents The following provides an overview of our consolidated results of operations by focusing on key elements in our Statements of Earnings. Product sales are predominantly generated in the Aeronautics, Electronic Systems, and Space Systems business segments, and most of our services sales are generated in our Electronic Systems and IS&GS business segments. Net Sales (In millions) 2011 2010 2009 Net Sales Products $ 36,925 $ 36,380 $ 35,689 Services 9,574 9,291 8,178 Total $ 46,499 $ 45,671 $ 43,867 Approximately 95% of our contracts are accounted for using the percentage-of-completion (POC) method of accounting. Under the POC method, we record net sales on contracts based upon our progress towards completion on a particular contract, as well as our estimate of the profit to be earned at completion. The following discussion of material changes in our consolidated net sales should be read in tandem with the following discussion of changes in our consolidated cost of sales and our Discussion of Business Segments, because, due to the nature of POC accounting, changes in our sales are typically accompanied by a corresponding change in our cost of sales. Net sales for 2011 were $46.5 billion, a $828 million or 2% increase over 2010 net sales of $45.7 billion. The increase was due to a $545 million or 1% increase in product sales and a $283 million or 3% increase in services sales. Net sales for 2010 were $45.7 billion, a $1.8 billion or 4% increase over 2009 net sales of $43.9 billion. The increase was due to a $691 million or 2% increase in product sales and a $1.1 billion or 14% increase in services sales. Product Sales Product sales at Aeronautics increased about $1.2 billion in 2011 compared to 2010 primarily due to production activities on the F-35 LRIP contracts, volume on C-130 programs (including eight additional C-130J aircraft deliveries), F-16 support activities and deliveries (two additional F-16 aircraft deliveries) and volume on C-5 programs (including one additional C-5M aircraft delivery) partially offset by lower volume on the F-22 program and F-35 SDD contract. Electronic Systems product sales increased approximately $60 million in 2011 compared to 2010 primarily due to production on air defense programs (including PAC-3 and THAAD) and the LCS program partially offset by lower volume on certain ship and aviation programs, tactical missile programs (including Multiple Launch Rocket System (MLRS) and Joint Air-to-Surface Standoff Missile (JASSM)) and fire control programs. Product sales decreased at IS&GS in 2011 compared to 2010 by about $700 million primarily due to the absence of the Decennial Response Integration System (DRIS) program that supported the 2010 U.S. census and a decline in activities on the Airborne Maritime Fixed Station Joint Tactical Radio System (JTRS) program. Product sales at Space Systems declined about $60 million in 2011 compared to 2010 primarily due to lower sales on the Orion Multi-Purpose Crew Vehicle (Orion) program and the NASA External Tank program, due to the completion of the Space Shuttle program, partially offset by higher volume on fleet ballistic missile programs and commercial satellites. Product sales at Aeronautics increased about $1.0 billion in 2010 compared to 2009 primarily due to production volume on the F-35 LRIP contracts, activities on C-130 programs (including nine additional C-130J aircraft deliveries), and volume on C-5 programs (including one additional C-5M aircraft delivery) partially offset by lower volumes on the F-22 program, F-35 SDD contract and F-16 (including 11 fewer F-16 aircraft deliveries) program. Electronic Systems product sales increased approximately $125 million in 2010 compared to 2009 primarily due to production on air defense programs (including PAC-3) and tactical missile programs (including Hellfire, MLRS, and JASSM) partially offset by lower sales on various underseas programs. IS&GS product sales were relatively unchanged between 2010 and 2009 as increasing activities on DRIS were offset by lower activities on many smaller programs. Product sales at Space Systems decreased about $460 million in 2010 compared to 2009 primarily due to lower volume on defensive missile systems, activities on the NASA External Tank program due to the wind down of the Space Shuttle program and volume from commercial satellite and launch vehicle activities. There was one commercial satellite delivery in both 2010 and 2009, and there were no commercial launches in 2010 compared to one commercial launch in 2009. 27 Table of Contents Services Sales Services sales at Electronic Systems increased about $165 million in 2011 compared to 2010 primarily due to growth on the Special Operations Forces Contractor Logistics Support Services (SOF CLSS) program partially offset by lower volume on various other logistic and training services programs. Services sales at IS&GS increased approximately $155 million in 2011 compared to 2010 due to activities on a number of smaller contracts. Most of our services sales are in the Electronic Systems and IS&GS business segments. Services sales at Electronic Systems increased about $645 million in 2010 compared to 2009 primarily due to growth on various logistic and training programs and the start of the SOF CLSS program in the third quarter of 2010. IS&GS services sales increased about $310 million in 2010 compared to 2009 due to activities on the Hanford Mission Support contract and numerous other services contracts at IS&GS. Cost of Sales Cost of sales, for both products and services, consist of materials, labor, and subcontracting costs, as well as an allocation of indirect costs (overhead and general and administrative). For each of our contracts, we manage the nature and amount of costs at the contract level, which form the basis for estimating our total costs at completion of the contract. Management evaluates performance on our contracts by focusing on net sales and operating profit, and not by type or amount of operating expense. Consequently, our discussion of business segment performance focuses on net sales and operating profit, consistent with our approach for managing the business. This approach is consistent with the overall life cycle of our contracts, as management assesses the bidding of each contract by focusing on net sales and operating profit, and monitors performance on our contracts in a similar manner through their completion. We regularly provide customers with reports of our costs as the contract progresses. The cost information in the reports is accumulated in a manner specified by the requirements of each contract. For example, cost data provided to our customer for a product would typically align to the subcomponents of that product (such as a wing-box on an aircraft) or for services, the type of work being performed (such as help-desk support). Our contracts generally are cost-based, which allows for the recovery of costs in the pricing of our products and services. Most of our contracts generally are bid and negotiated with our customers based on the mutual awareness of our estimated costs to provide the product or service. This approach for negotiating contracts with our U.S. Government customers generally allows for the recovery of our costs. We also may enter into long-term supply contracts for certain materials or components, to coincide with the production schedule of certain products and to ensure their availability at known unit prices. (In millions) 2011 2010 2009 Cost of sales Cost of product sales $ (32,968 ) $ (32,539 ) $ (31,643 ) % of product sales 89.3 % 89.4 % 88.7 % Cost of services sales (8,514 ) (8,382 ) (7,406 ) % of services sales 88.9 % 90.2 % 90.6 % Severance and other charges (136 ) (220 ) Other unallocated corporate costs (1,177 ) (742 ) (671 ) Total $ (42,795 ) $ (41,883 ) $ (39,720 ) Due to the nature of POC accounting, changes in our cost of product and services sales are typically accompanied by changes in our net sales. The following discussion of material changes in our consolidated cost of sales should be read in tandem with the preceding discussion of changes in our consolidated net sales and with our Discussion of Business Segments. Cost of sales was $42.8 billion in 2011, a $912 million or 2% increase over 2010 cost of sales of $41.9 billion. The increase was due to a $429 million increase in cost of product sales, a $132 million increase in cost of services sales and a $435 million increase in other unallocated corporate costs, partially offset by a reduction in severance and other charges of $84 million as further discussed in the following sections. Cost of sales was $41.9 billion in 2010, a $2.2 billion or 5% increase over 2009 cost of sales of $39.7 billion. The increase was due to a $896 million increase in cost of product sales, a $976 million increase in cost of services sales, a $71 million increase in other unallocated corporate costs and an increase for severance and other charges of $220 million, as further discussed in the following sections. 28 Table of Contents Cost of Product Sales Cost of product sales at Aeronautics increased by about $1.1 billion in 2011 compared to 2010 primarily due to production volume on various programs, including F-35 LRIP contracts, and the impact of additional aircraft deliveries. Cost of product sales for Electronic Systems was relatively unchanged between 2011 and 2010. Cost of product sales at IS&GS decreased about $560 million in 2011 compared to 2010 primarily due to the absence of the DRIS program and lower volume on the JTRS program. Cost of product sales decreased at Space Systems by about $120 million in 2011 compared to 2010 primarily due to lower volume on the NASA External Tank and Orion programs. Cost of product sales at Aeronautics increased by about $1.1 billion in 2010 compared to 2009 primarily due to production activities on various programs, including F-35 LRIP contracts, and the impact of aircraft deliveries. Cost of product sales at Electronic Systems increased about $115 million in 2010 compared to 2009 primarily due to volume on air defense and tactical missile programs. IS&GS cost of product sales were relatively unchanged between 2010 and 2009. Cost of product sales at Space Systems declined about $400 million in 2010 compared to 2009 primarily due to lower volume on various programs, including the NASA External Tank, and the absence of a commercial launch as compared to the prior year. The 0.70% increase in the percentage of cost of product sales relative to product sales in 2010 compared to 2009 primarily was due to the increased development and initial production work on the F-35 program and less work on mature programs, such as F-22 and F-16. Development and initial production contracts yield lower profits than mature full rate programs. Cost of Services Sales Cost of services sales at Electronic Systems increased about $180 million in 2011 compared to 2010 primarily due to SOF CLSS. Cost of services sales at IS&GS decreased by about $55 million in 2011 compared to 2010 primarily due to the retirement of risks during 2011 and the recognition of reserves on various programs in 2010. The 1.3% decrease in the percentage of cost of services sales relative to services sales in 2011 compared to 2010 primarily was due to the retirement risks and other factors on numerous programs at IS&GS, partially offset by volume on SOF CLSS, which provides a lower margin relative to other Electronic Systems programs. Most of our services sales are in the Electronic Systems and IS&GS business segments. Cost of services sales at Electronic Systems increased about $535 million in 2010 compared to 2009 primarily due to volume on various logistics activities, as well as the start of the SOF CLSS program. IS&GS cost of services sales increased approximately $325 million in 2010 compared to 2009 due to volume on various service contracts, including the Hanford Mission Support contract. Most of our services sales are in the Electronic Systems and IS&GS business segments. Severance and other charges During 2011, we recorded charges related to certain severance actions totaling $136 million, net of state tax benefits. Of these severance charges, $49 million and $48 million related to our Aeronautics and Space Systems business segments, and $39 million related to our IS&GS business segment and Corporate Headquarters. These charges reduced our net earnings in 2011 by $88 million ($.26 per share). These severance actions resulted from a strategic review of these businesses and our Corporate Headquarters to better align our organization and cost structure with changing economic conditions. The workforce reductions at the business segments also reflect changes in program lifecycles, where several of our major programs are transitioning out of development and into production, and certain programs are ending. The charges consisted of severance costs associated with the planned elimination of certain positions through either voluntary or involuntary actions. In 2010, we recorded a charge of $178 million, net of state tax benefits, related to the VESP. The charge, which included lump-sum special payments for qualifying executives, reduced our net earnings by $116 million ($.31 per share). The amounts of the VESP attributable to our business segments were $25 million at Aeronautics, $38 million at Electronic Systems, $42 million at IS&GS, and $41 million at Space Systems. The remaining $32 million was attributable to our Corporate Headquarters. Also, in 2010, we recorded a $42 million charge related to our decision to consolidate certain operations within our Electronic Systems business segment, including the closure of a facility in Eagan, Minnesota. This charge reduced our net earnings for 2010 by $27 million ($.07 per share). The majority of the charge was associated with the accrual of severance payments to employees, with the remainder associated with impairment of assets. We expect to recover a substantial amount of these severance charges, including the charge related to the VESP, in future periods through the pricing of our products and services to the U.S. Government and other customers. While the VESP is expected to be recovered over several years, the other severance charges would typically be expected to be recovered within a one-year period. For example, Space Systems recovered most of its severance charge in the second half of 2011. 29 Table of Contents Other unallocated corporate costs Other unallocated corporate costs principally includes the non-cash FAS/CAS pension adjustment, stock compensation, and other corporate costs. These costs are not allocated to the business segments and, therefore, are excluded from the costs of product and services sales (see Note 4 to the accompanying consolidated financial statements for a description of these items). The $435 million increase between 2011 and 2010 primarily was attributable to an increase in the non-cash FAS/CAS pension adjustment of $468 million, which included increased FAS pension expense in 2011 compared to 2010 due to the decrease in the discount rate in 2011, together with the effect of the recognition of the 2008 investment losses, partially offset by the effects of investment gains in 2009 and 2010 (each as compared to our 8.50% long-term rate of return assumption). For more information, see the related discussion in Critical Accounting Policies under the caption Postretirement Benefit Plans. Other unallocated corporate costs increased $71 million between 2010 and 2009 primarily due to fluctuations in expense associated with a number of corporate activities. Changes in our cost of sales between periods were not material, except as described above. The period-over-period change in our cost of sales was due to the volume of costs resulting from production, deliveries of products, and/or services provided on our portfolio of contracts. We have not identified any developing trends in cost of sales that would have a material impact on our future operations. Operating Profit Our operating profit for 2011 was $4.0 billion, essentially unchanged from 2010. The increase in the non-cash FAS/CAS pension adjustment was offset by increases in operating profit in every business segment, a decrease in severance and other charges, and a decrease in other unallocated corporate costs attributable to various corporate activities. Our operating profit for 2010 was $4.0 billion, a decrease of 7% compared to operating profit of $4.4 billion in 2009. The decline in operating profit of $318 million primarily was attributable to the effects of severance and other charges, net of state tax benefits, of $220 million (Note 2). Interest Expense Interest expense for 2011 was $354 million, about the same as in 2010. Increased interest expense from the $2.0 billion issuance of long-term debt late in the third quarter of 2011 partially was offset by the redemption of certain notes in the fourth quarter of 2011. Interest expense for 2010 was $345 million, or $37 million higher than 2009. The increase mainly was driven by interest expense on the $1.5 billion of long-term notes issued in the fourth quarter of 2009. Other Non-Operating Income, Net Other non-operating income, net was $5 million in 2011, compared to $74 million in 2010. The decrease primarily was due to premiums of $48 million on early extinguishments of debt (Note 9) and lower net unrealized gains on marketable securities held to fund certain non-qualified employee benefit obligations in 2011. Other non-operating income, net was $74 million in 2010, compared to $123 million in 2009. The change between periods primarily reflects lower net unrealized gains on marketable securities held to fund certain non-qualified employee benefit obligations. Income Tax Expense Our effective income tax rate from continuing operations was 26.5% for 2011, 30.8% for 2010, and 29.1% for 2009. These rates were lower than the statutory rate of 35% for all periods due to tax benefits for U.S. manufacturing activities, the deduction of dividends related to certain of our defined contribution plans with an employee stock ownership plan feature, and the research and development (R&D) tax credit. The 2011 effective tax rate was affected by the completion by the U.S. Congressional Joint Committee on Taxation of its review of IRS Appeals resolution of certain adjustments related to tax years 2003-2008. As a result of completion of the review in April 2011, we recorded a reduction in income tax expense of $89 million in 2011. The effective tax rates for 2011 and 2010 also included additional tax benefits related to U.S. manufacturing activities primarily due to an increase in 2011 and 2010 qualified production activity income and an increase in the U.S. manufacturing activity deduction rate from 6% to 9%. 30 Table of Contents The 2010 effective tax rate was affected by the enactment of the Patient Protection and Affordable Care Act and the Health Care and Education Reconciliation Act of 2010, which eliminated the tax deduction for company-paid retiree prescription drug expenses to the extent they are reimbursed under Medicare Part D, beginning in 2013. As a result, we recorded additional income tax expense of $96 million in 2010. The 2009 effective tax rate reflected a reduction of income tax expense of $69 million primarily arising from the resolution of IRS examinations of the years 2005 through 2007 and 2008. The Administration recent proposal to lower the corporate tax rate would require us to reduce our deferred tax assets upon enactment of the related tax legislation with a corresponding material, one-time increase to income tax expense; however, our income tax expense and payments would be reduced in subsequent years. Net Earnings from Continuing Operations We reported net earnings from continuing operations of $2.7 billion ($7.85 per share) in 2011, $2.6 billion ($7.10 per share) in 2010, and $3.0 billion ($7.63 per share) in 2009. Both net earnings from continuing operations and earnings per share were affected by the factors discussed above. In addition, earnings per share has benefitted from a significant number of shares repurchased under our share repurchase program, partially offset by common stock issued under our stock-based compensation and defined contribution plans. Share repurchases of 31.8 million, 33.0 million, and 24.9 million in 2011, 2010, and 2009 represented 9%, 9%, and 6% of our shares outstanding at the beginning of each year. Net Earnings from Discontinued Operations Net earnings from discontinued operations included the operating results of Savi for all periods presented. Discontinued operations also included PAE for 2009, 2010, and through the date of its sale on April 4, 2011, and those of EIG for 2009 and through the date of its sale on November 22, 2010. We reported a net loss from discontinued operations of $12 million ($.04 per share) in 2011, and net earnings from discontinued operations of $264 million ($.71 per share) in 2010 and $6 million ($.01 per share) in 2009. Net earnings from discontinued operations for 2011 included a net benefit of $40 million related to the decision to sell Savi, the principal driver of which is the recognition of a deferred tax asset for book and tax basis differences. A similar tax benefit of $15 million related to the sale of PAE was also recorded in 2011. Net earnings from discontinued operations for 2010 included a gain, net of income taxes, of $184 million ($.50 per share) from the sale of EIG. Additionally, as a result of our decision to sell PAE in 2010, we recorded net adjustments that increased 2010 earnings from discontinued operations by $73 million ($.20 per share). For additional information, see Note 14 to the accompanying consolidated financial statements. Discussion of Business Segments We operate in four business segments: Aeronautics, Electronic Systems, IS&GS, and Space Systems. We organize our business segments based on the nature of the products and services offered. The following table presents net sales and operating profit of our four business segments. Net sales exclude intersegment revenue, as these activities are eliminated in consolidation. Intercompany transactions are generally negotiated under terms and conditions similar to other government and commercial contracts. Operating profit of the business segments includes the equity earnings or losses from investees in which certain of our business segments hold equity interests, because the activities of the investees are closely aligned with the operations of those segments. Operating profit of the business segments excludes the non-cash FAS/CAS pension adjustment discussed below; expense for certain stock-based compensation programs, including costs for stock options and restricted stock units; the effects of items not considered part of management evaluation of segment operating performance, such as the severance charges in 2011 and the charges in 2010 related to the VESP and facilities consolidation within Electronic Systems (Note 2); gains or losses from divestitures (Note 14); the effects of legal settlements; corporate costs not allocated to the business segments; and other miscellaneous corporate activities. The items other than the charges related to severance, the VESP, and facilities consolidation are included in Other unallocated corporate expense, net in the following table which reconciles operating profit from the business segments to operating profit in our Statements of Earnings. The charges related to severance, the VESP, and facilities consolidation are presented together as a separate reconciling item. 31 Table of Contents During the fourth quarter of 2011, we realigned an immaterial supply chain services business from our Aeronautics business segment to our Electronic Systems business segment. The realignment had no effect on our consolidated results of operations, financial position, or cash flows. The financial information in the following table has been reclassified to reflect this realignment. (In millions) 2011 2010 2009 Net Sales Aeronautics $ 14,362 $ 13,109 $ 11,988 Electronic Systems 14,622 14,399 13,630 Information Systems & Global Solutions 9,381 9,921 9,599 Space Systems 8,134 8,242 8,650 Total $ 46,499 $ 45,671 $ 43,867 Operating Profit Aeronautics $ 1,630 $ 1,498 $ 1,567 Electronic Systems 1,788 1,748 1,648 Information Systems & Global Solutions 874 814 874 Space Systems 989 968 967 Total business segments 5,281 5,028 5,056 Unallocated corporate expense: Non-cash FAS/CAS pension adjustment: FAS pension expense (1,821 ) (1,442 ) (1,036 ) Less: CAS expense (899 ) (988 ) (580 ) Non-cash FAS/CAS pension adjustment (a) (922 ) (454 ) (456 ) Severance and other charges (136 ) (220 ) Stock compensation expense and other, net (b) (243 ) (305 ) (233 ) Total unallocated corporate expense, net (1,301 ) (979 ) (689 ) Total operating profit $ 3,980 $ 4,049 $ 4,367 (a) FAS pension expense increased in 2011 compared to 2010, and in 2010 compared to 2009, due to the decrease in the discount rate each year, together with the effect of the recognition of investment losses from 2008, partially offset by the effects of investment gains in 2009 and 2010 (each as compared to our 8.50% long-term rate of return assumption). The segment operating profit includes pension expense only as determined and funded in accordance with U.S. Government Cost Accounting Standards (CAS). The non-cash FAS/CAS pension adjustment represents the difference between pension expense calculated in accordance with GAAP and pension costs calculated and funded in accordance with CAS. The non-cash FAS/CAS pension adjustment is expected to be about $835 million in 2012. For more information, see the related discussion in Critical Accounting Policies under the caption Postretirement Benefit Plans ). (b) The change in stock compensation expense and other, net between the periods primarily was due to fluctuations in expense associated with various corporate activities, none individually significant. The following segment discussions also include information relating to negotiated backlog for each segment. Total negotiated backlog was approximately $80.7 billion, $78.4 billion, and $77.3 billion at December 31, 2011, 2010, and 2009. These amounts included both funded backlog (unfilled firm orders for which funding has been both authorized and appropriated by the customer Congress in the case of U.S. Government agencies) and unfunded backlog (firm orders for which funding has not yet been appropriated). Negotiated backlog does not include unexercised options or task orders to be issued under indefinite-delivery, indefinite-quantity (IDIQ) contracts. Funded backlog was approximately $55.1 billion at December 31, 2011. Our net sales are derived from long-term contracts for DD&P activities and for services provided to the U.S. Government as well as FMS conducted through the U.S. Government. We account for these contracts, as well as DD&P contracts with non-U.S. Government customers, under the POC method of accounting which represent approximately 95% of our net sales. We derive our remaining net sales from contracts to provide services to non-U.S. Government customers, which we account for under the services method of accounting. Under the POC method of accounting, we record sales on contracts based upon our progress towards completion on a particular contract as well as our estimate of the profit to be earned at completion. Cost-reimbursable contracts, which account for the majority of our net sales, provide for the payment of allowable costs plus a fee. For fixed-priced contracts, net sales and cost of sales are recognized as products are delivered or as costs are incurred. Due to the nature of the POC method of accounting, changes in our cost of sales are typically accompanied by a related change in our net sales. 32 Table of Contents Changes in volume refer to increases or decreases in net sales resulting from varying production activity levels, deliveries, or service levels on individual contracts. Volume changes typically include a corresponding change in segment operating profit based on the current profit booking rate for a particular contract. For example, if the cost volume on a cost-reimbursement-type contract increased or decreased compared with a prior period, sales and operating profit for that contract also will be increased or decreased. Changes in performance refer to increases or decreases in the estimated profit booking rates on our POC contracts and usually relate to revisions in the total estimated costs at completion that reflect improved or deteriorated conditions on a particular contract. For example, improved conditions typically result from the retirement of risks on contracts. Such changes in estimated profit booking rates are recognized in the current period and reflect the inception-to-date effect of such changes. For example, if we increase the estimated profit booking rate on a cost-reimbursable contract, the increase in sales and operating profit for that contract will reflect a higher return on sales in the current period due to the recognition of the higher profit booking rate on both current period costs as well as previously incurred costs. Many of our contracts are multi-billion dollar contracts that span several years and include highly complex technical requirements. At the outset of a contract, we identify and monitor risks to the achievement of the technical, schedule, and costs aspects of the contract, and assess the effects of those risks on our estimates of total costs to complete the contract. The estimates consider the technical requirements (for example, a newly-developed product versus a mature product), the schedule and associated tasks (for example, the number and type of milestone events), and costs (for example, material, labor, subcontractor and overhead). The initial profit booking rate of each contract considers risks surrounding the ability to achieve the technical requirements, schedule, and costs in the initial estimated costs at completion. Profit booking rates may increase during the performance of the contract if we successfully retire risks surrounding the technical, schedule and costs aspects of the contract. All of the estimates are subject to change during the performance of the contract and may affect the profit booking rate. We have a number of programs that are designated as classified by the U.S. Government and cannot be specifically described. The operating results of these classified programs are included in our consolidated and business segment results, and are subjected to the same oversight and internal controls as our other programs. Aeronautics Our Aeronautics business segment is engaged in the research, design, development, manufacture, integration, sustainment, support, and upgrade of advanced military aircraft, including combat and air mobility aircraft, unmanned air vehicles, and related technologies. Aeronautics also provides logistics support, sustainment, and upgrade modification services for its aircraft. Aeronautics major programs include the F-35 Lightning II Joint Strike Fighter, F-16 Fighting Falcon, F-22 Raptor, C-130J Hercules, and the C-5M Super Galaxy. Aeronautics operating results included the following: (In millions) 2011 2010 2009 Net sales $ 14,362 $ 13,109 $ 11,988 Operating profit 1,630 1,498 1,567 Operating margin 11.3 % 11.4 % 13.1 % Backlog at year-end 30,500 27,500 26,800 Net sales for the Aeronautics segment increased $1.3 billion, or 10%, in 2011 compared to 2010. The growth in net sales primarily was due to higher volume of about $850 million for work performed on the F-35 LRIP contracts as production increased, higher volume of about $745 million for C-130 programs due to an increase in deliveries (33 C-130J aircraft delivered in 2011 compared to 25 during 2010) and support activities, about $425 million for F-16 support activities and an increase in aircraft deliveries (22 F-16 aircraft delivered in 2011 compared to 20 during 2010), and approximately $90 million for higher volume on C-5 programs (two C-5M aircraft delivered in 2011 compared to one during 2010). These increases partially were offset by a decline in net sales of approximately $675 million due to lower volume on the F-22 program, which will continue to decline as production winds down with final deliveries expected to be completed in 2012, and lower net sales of about $155 million for the F-35 SDD contract as development work decreased. Net sales for the Aeronautics segment increased by $1.1 billion, or 9%, in 2010 compared to 2009. The increase primarily was due to additional volume from work performed on the F-35 LRIP contracts of approximately $1.6 billion, higher volume of about $690 million for C-130 programs due to an increase in deliveries (25 C-130J aircraft delivered in 2010 as compared to 16 in 2009) and support activities, and higher volume on C-5 programs of about $115 million, including 33 Table of Contents delivery of the first C-5M. These increases partially were offset by lower volume of approximately $660 million on the F-35 SDD contract, lower F-16 volume of approximately $340 million primarily due to a reduction of deliveries (20 F-16 deliveries in 2010 compared to 31 in 2009), and lower volume on the F-22 program of $305 million as production continued to wind down. Operating profit for the Aeronautics segment increased $132 million, or 9%, in 2011 compared to 2010. The increase primarily was attributable to approximately $115 million of higher operating profit on C-130 programs due to increased volume and the retirement of risks, increased volume and risk retirements on F-16 programs of about $50 million and C-5 programs of approximately $20 million, and about $70 million due to risk retirements on other Aeronautics sustainment activities in 2011. These increases partially were offset by a decline in operating profit of approximately $75 million on the F-22 program and F-35 SDD contract primarily due to lower volume and about $55 million on other programs, including F-35 LRIP, primarily due to lower profit rate adjustments in 2011, compared to 2010. Operating profit for the Aeronautics segment decreased by $69 million, or 4%, in 2010 compared to 2009. The decrease primarily was attributable to a decline in operating profit on the F-22 program of about $75 million due to lower volume and a decrease in the level of risk retirements as the production program winds down, lower volume and a decrease in the level of risk retirements of approximately $45 million on the F-35 SDD contract, and a decline in operating profit of about $40 million on the F-16 program due to a reduction of deliveries. These decreases more than offset increased operating profit resulting from higher volume and risk retirements on the F-35 LRIP contracts of approximately $100 million. The decrease in the Aeronautics segment operating margin from 2010 to 2009 reflects increased development and initial production work on the F-35 program and less work on more mature programs such as the F-22 and F-16. Development and initial production contracts yield lower profits than mature full rate programs. Accordingly, while net sales increased in 2010 relative to 2009, operating profit decreased and consequently operating margins have declined. Backlog increased in 2011 compared to 2010 mainly due to orders exceeding sales on the F-35 and C-5 programs, which partially were offset by higher sales volume on the C-130 program. Backlog increased in 2010 compared to 2009 mainly due to orders exceeding sales on the C-130, F-35 and C-5 programs, which partially were offset by higher sales volume compared to new orders on the F-22 program in 2010. We expect that Aeronautics net sales in 2012 will be comparable with 2011. An increase in net sales on the F-35 LRIP contracts is expected to be mostly offset by a decline in volume on the F-22 production program due to completion of the production program with the last aircraft delivery in the first half of 2012. Operating profit is projected to decrease at a low single digit percentage range from 2011 levels, resulting in a slight decline in operating margins between the years. Electronic Systems Our Electronic Systems business segment provides surface ship and submarine combat systems; sea-based missile defense systems; ship systems integration; littoral combat ships; nuclear instrumentation and control systems for naval submarines, aircraft carriers, and surface warships; air and defense missile systems; air-to-ground precision strike weapons systems; tactical missiles; munitions; fire control and navigation systems for rotary and fixed-wing aircraft; manned and unmanned ground vehicles; mission operations support, readiness, engineering support, and integration services; simulation and training services; and energy programs. Electronic Systems major programs include the Aegis Combat System, PAC-3, THAAD, MLRS, Hellfire, JASSM, Apache Fire Control System, LCS, and SOF CLSS. We have classified Savi as discontinued operations (Note 14) and, therefore, financial information related to this business has been excluded from the segment information below. Electronic Systems operating results included the following: (In millions) 2011 2010 2009 Net sales $ 14,622 $ 14,399 $ 13,630 Operating profit 1,788 1,748 1,648 Operating margin 12.2 % 12.1 % 12.1 % Backlog at year-end 24,900 23,400 23,000 Net sales for the Electronic Systems segment increased $223 million, or 2%, in 2011 compared to 2010. The increase was due to higher volume on air defense programs (including PAC-3 and THAAD) of about $420 million, logistics activities 34 Table of Contents of about $330 million related to the SOF CLSS program, which began late in the quarter ended September 26, 2010, and the LCS program of approximately $165 million. These increases partially were offset by a decline in volume of approximately $375 million for certain ship and aviation programs (primarily Maritime Patrol Aircraft and PTDS), about $200 million for various logistics and training services, and approximately $115 million for tactical missile and fire control programs. Net sales for the Electronic Systems segment increased by $769 million, or 6%, in 2010 compared to 2009. Contributing to the increases were higher volume of about $430 million on various training and logistics activities (including the SOF CLSS program), increased deliveries on tactical missile programs (including MLRS and JASSM) of approximately $250 million, increased volume on various surface naval warfare programs (the Aegis Combat System) of about $140 million, and higher volume of about $100 million on air defense programs (including PAC-3). These increases partially were offset by lower volume of approximately $185 million on undersea warfare programs. Operating profit for the Electronic Systems segment increased $40 million, or 2%, compared to the corresponding period in 2010. Operating profit increased by about $60 million due to higher volume and retirement of risks on air defense programs (including PAC-3 and THAAD) and approximately $35 million primarily due to the recognition of reserves on certain undersea warfare programs in 2010. These increases partially were offset by approximately $55 million of reserves for contract cost matters on various ship and aviation programs (including the terminated presidential helicopter program). Operating profit for the Electronic Systems segment increased by $100 million, or 6%, in 2010 compared to 2009. The increase primarily was attributable to volume and retirement of risk on various training and logistics services programs of about $50 million, approximately $65 million on tactical missiles programs (including MLRS and JASSM) due to volume and the retirement of risks, and about $40 million due to the retirement of risks on fire control programs. These increases partially were offset by a decline in operating profit of approximately $75 million on undersea warfare programs due to lower volume and recognition of reserves. Backlog increased in 2011 compared to 2010 primarily due to orders exceeding sales on air defense programs (including THAAD and PAC-3), partially offset by higher sales volume on various training and logistics activities and surface naval warfare programs. Backlog increased in 2010 compared to 2009 primarily from increased orders for air defense and tactical missile programs and on various training and logistics services programs. These increases partially were offset by higher sales volume on ship and aviation systems and surface naval warfare programs. We expect Electronic Systems net sales for 2012 will be comparable with 2011. We expect flat to low single digit percentage growth in key programs such as the LCS, offset by a decline in volume on logistics and training services contracts. Operating profit and margin are expected to be comparable with 2011 results. Information Systems & Global Solutions Our IS&GS business segment provides management services, Information Technology (IT) solutions, and advanced technology expertise across a broad spectrum of applications. IS&GS supports the needs of customers in human capital planning, data protection and sharing, cyber-security, financial services, health care, energy and environment, security, space exploration, biometrics, and transportation. IS&GS provides network-enabled situation awareness, delivers communications and command and control capability through complex mission solutions for defense applications, and integrates complex global systems to help our customers gather, analyze, and securely distribute critical intelligence data. IS&GS has a portfolio of many smaller contracts as compared to our other business segments. IS&GS major programs include the Command and Control, Battle Management, and Communications contract, En-Route Automation Modernization (ERAM) contract, the Hanford Mission Support contract, and the National Science Foundation U.S. Antarctic Support program. We have classified PAE and EIG as discontinued operations (Note 14) and, therefore, financial information related to these businesses has been excluded from the segment information below. IS&GS operating results included the following: (In millions) 2011 2010 2009 Net sales $ 9,381 $ 9,921 $ 9,599 Operating profit 874 814 874 Operating margin 9.3 % 8.2 % 9.1 % Backlog at year-end 9,300 9,700 10,700 35 Table of Contents Net sales for the IS&GS segment decreased $540 million, or 5%, in 2011 compared to 2010. The decrease primarily was attributable to lower volume of approximately $665 million due to the absence of the DRIS program that supported the 2010 U.S. census and a decline in activities on the JTRS program. This decrease partially was offset by increased net sales on numerous programs. Net sales for the IS&GS segment increased $322 million, or 3%, in 2010 compared to 2009. The increase primarily was attributable to higher volume of $620 million on the DRIS program and the Hanford Mission Support contract. These increases partially were offset by lower volume on numerous smaller programs. Operating profit for the IS&GS segment increased $60 million, or 7%, in 2011 compared to 2010. Operating profit increased approximately $180 million due to volume and the retirement of risks in 2011 and the absence of reserves recognized in 2010 on numerous programs (including among others, the NASA Outsourcing Desktop Initiative (ODIN) (about $60 million) and Transportation Worker Identification Credential and Automated Flight Service Station programs). The increases in operating profit partially were offset by the absence of the DRIS program and a decline in activities on the JTRS program of about $120 million. Operating profit for the IS&GS segment decreased $60 million, or 7%, in 2010 compared to 2009. The decrease primarily was attributable to the recognition of reserves of about $55 million on several programs (including, among others, the ODIN program). Lower volume on numerous programs offset increased operating profit from the DRIS program. The decrease in backlog during 2011 compared to 2010 mainly was due to declining activities on the JTRS program and several other smaller programs. The decrease in backlog during 2010 compared to 2009 mainly was due to higher sales volume associated with the DRIS program, the Hanford Mission Support contract, and several other smaller programs. We expect IS&GS will experience a decrease in net sales in the mid to upper single digit percentage range for 2012 as compared to 2011. The decline is primarily due to the completion of various programs including ODIN, the U.K. Census, and JTRS, and we do not expect that this work will be replaced by other contracts due to the fiscal pressures constraining government purchases of IT and other products and services. Operating profit is expected to decline in 2012 in the upper single digit percentage range as a result of the lower sales volume, resulting in a slight decline in operating margins between the years. Space Systems Our Space Systems business segment is engaged in the design, research and development, engineering, and production of satellites, strategic and defensive missile systems, and space transportation systems, including activities related to the planned replacement of the Space Shuttle. Space Systems is responsible for various classified systems and services in support of vital national security systems. Space Systems major programs include the Trident II D5 Fleet Ballistic Missile, Space-Based Infrared System (SBIRS), Orion, Advanced Extremely High Frequency (AEHF) system, Global Positioning Satellite (GPS) III system, and Mobile User Objective System (MUOS). Space Systems has an ownership interest in United Launch Alliance (ULA), which provides expendable launch services for the U.S. Government, and in United Space Alliance (USA), which provides processing activities for the Space Shuttle program, which is winding down following the completion of the last mission in 2011. Space Systems operating results included the following: (In millions) 2011 2010 2009 Net sales $ 8,134 $ 8,242 $ 8,650 Operating profit 989 968 967 Operating margin 12.2 % 11.7 % 11.2 % Backlog at year-end 16,000 17,800 16,800 Net sales for the Space Systems segment decreased $108 million, or 1%, in 2011 compared to 2010. The decrease in net sales was attributable to a decline of about $90 million related to the NASA External Tank program, which ended in connection with the completion of the last Space Shuttle mission in July 2011, a decline in volume of about $90 million related to the Orion program, and lower volume of approximately $30 million related to government satellites. These decreases partially were offset by higher volume for fleet ballistic and defensive missile systems of about $80 million and commercial satellites of approximately $45 million (one commercial satellite delivery in both 2011 and 2010). Net sales for the Space Systems segment decreased $408 million or 5% in 2010 compared to 2009. The decline principally was due to lower volume on defensive missile systems of approximately $150 million, the NASA External Tank 36 Table of Contents program of about $130 million due to the wind down of the Space Shuttle program and volume from commercial satellite and launch vehicle activities of approximately $125 million. There was one commercial satellite delivery in 2010 and 2009 and no commercial launches in 2010 compared to one commercial launch in 2009. Partially offsetting these decreases was a growth of about $35 million due to higher volume in government satellites activities. Operating profit for the Space Systems segment increased $21 million, or 2%, in 2011 compared to 2010. The increase in operating profit principally was attributable to retirement of risks on government satellite programs of about $60 million and decreased equity earnings of about $30 million primarily due to the completion of the Space Shuttle program. Operating profit for the Space Systems segment was unchanged for 2010 compared to 2009. Operating profit increased on government satellites programs by approximately $15 million due to higher volume and risk retirements and higher equity earnings of approximately $40 million. These increases were offset by lower volume and reserve for performance of about $40 million on commercial satellite programs and lower volume on the NASA External Tank program of approximately $15 million. Total equity earnings recognized by the Space Systems segment from ULA and USA represented approximately $230 million, or 23% of this segment operating profit during 2011. During 2010, total equity earnings recognized by the Space Systems segment from ULA and USA represented approximately $260 million, or 27% of this segment operating profit. Backlog decreased in 2011 compared to 2010 mainly due to higher sales volume associated with the Orion program and on government satellite activities. Backlog increased in 2010 compared to 2009 mainly due to orders exceeding sales on government satellite programs and strategic missile programs, which more than offset higher sales volume compared to new orders on the Orion program in 2010. We expect Space Systems net sales to decline in 2012 in the mid single digit percentage range as compared to 2011 primarily due to lower activities on government satellite programs and the Orion program. Operating profit is expected to decline in the mid to upper single digit percentage range in 2012 due to the lower sales volume as well as lower equity earnings from ULA, resulting in a slight decline in operating margins between the years. Liquidity and Cash Flows Our access to capital resources that provide liquidity has not been materially affected by the changing economic and market conditions over the past few years. We continually monitor changes in such conditions so that we can timely respond to any related developments. We have generated strong operating cash flows which have been the primary source of funding for our operations, debt service and repayments, capital expenditures, share repurchases, dividends, acquisitions, and postretirement benefit plan funding. We have accessed the capital markets on limited occasions, as needed or when opportunistic. We expect our cash from operations to continue to be sufficient to support our operations and anticipated capital expenditures for the foreseeable future. We have financing resources available to fund potential cash outflows that are less predictable or more discretionary, as discussed under Capital Structure, Resources, and Other. We have access to the credit markets, if needed, for liquidity or general corporate purposes, including letters of credit to support customer advance payments and for other trade finance purposes such as guaranteeing our performance on particular contracts. Cash received from customers, either from the payment of invoices for work performed or for advances in excess of costs incurred, is our primary source of cash. We generally do not begin work on contracts until funding is appropriated by the customer. Billing timetables and payment terms on our contracts vary based on a number of factors, including the contract type. We generally bill and collect cash more frequently under cost-reimbursable and time-and-materials contracts, which together represent approximately 55% of the sales we recorded in 2011, as we are authorized to bill as the costs are incurred or work is performed. In contrast to cost-reimbursable contracts, for fixed-price contracts, which represented approximately 45% of the revenues we recorded in 2011, we generally do not bill until milestones, including deliveries, are achieved. A number of our fixed-price contracts may provide for performance-based payments which allow us to bill and collect cash as we perform on the contract. The U.S. Government recently has indicated that it would consider progress payments as the baseline for negotiating payment terms on fixed-price contracts, rather than performance-based payments. The use of progress payment provisions on fixed-price contracts may delay our ability to recover costs incurred and affect the timing of our cash flows. 37 Table of Contents The majority of our capital expenditures for 2011 and those planned for 2012 can be divided into the categories of facilities infrastructure, equipment, and IT. Expenditures for facilities infrastructure and equipment are generally incurred to support new and existing programs across all of our business segments. For example, we have projects underway in our Aeronautics business segment for facilities and equipment to support production of the F-35 combat aircraft. In addition, we have projects underway to modernize certain of our facilities. We also incur capital expenditures for IT to support programs and general enterprise IT infrastructure as well as for the development or purchase of internal-use software. We have a balanced cash deployment strategy to enhance stockholder value and position ourselves to take advantage of new business opportunities when they arise. Consistent with that strategy, we have invested in our business, including capital expenditures and independent research and development, repurchased shares, increased our dividends, made selective acquisitions of businesses, and managed our debt levels. The following table provides a summary of our cash flow information and the subsequent discussion provides an overview of our execution of this strategy. (In millions) 2011 2010 2009 Net cash provided by operating activities (a) $ 4,253 $ 3,801 $ 3,487 Net cash used for investing activities (a) (813 ) (573 ) (1,832 ) Net cash used for financing activities (2,119 ) (3,358 ) (1,432 ) (a) In the fourth quarter of 2011, we revised the classification of cash payments associated with the development or purchase of internal-use software from operating cash flows to investing cash flows (Note 1). Cash flows for all years above have been adjusted for this change. Cash payments for internal-use software were $173 million in 2011, $254 million in 2010, and $314 million in 2009. Operating Activities Net cash provided by operating activities increased by $452 million to $4.3 billion in 2011 as compared to 2010. The increase in cash flows from operating activities was driven by a $536 million increase in cash provided by operating working capital (defined as accounts receivable and inventories less accounts payable and customer advances and amounts in excess of costs incurred) as discussed below and $84 million related to lower net income tax payments due to the absence of a payment made in 2010 related to matters pending with IRS appeals. These improvements partially were offset by a $134 million net increase in cash outflows related to defined benefit pension plans, and lower operating results. The increase in cash outflows related to defined benefit pension plans was due to a $45 million increase in contributions paid to the pension trust and a decrease in the recovery of CAS costs on our contracts. The improvement in cash provided by operating working capital changes primarily was due to the timing of payment of accounts payable, which partially was offset by the timing of collections of accounts receivable and customer advance payments. The change in accounts receivable primarily reflects the timing of contract negotiations and related billing activities on the F-35 program at our Aeronautics segment. The decrease in cash flows from customer advances and amounts in excess of costs incurred was attributable to the C-130 programs at our Aeronautics segment, which was partially offset by various programs (largely PAC-3) at our Electronic Systems segment. Our operating working capital is subject to wide fluctuations based on the timing of cash transactions related to production schedules, timing of progress and advance payments, the acquisition of inventory, the collection of accounts receivable, and the payment of accounts payable. Cash provided by changes in operating working capital balances in 2012 may decrease over 2011 primarily due to the timing of collections of accounts receivable and the payment of accounts payable. Consequently, we expect that net cash provided by operating activities will be lower in 2012. Net cash provided by operating activities increased by $314 million to $3.8 billion in 2010 as compared to 2009. The increase primarily was attributable to changes in our operating working capital balances of $585 million and $187 million related to lower net income tax payments. Partially offsetting these improvements was a net reduction in cash of $350 million related to our defined benefit pension plans. The improvement in cash provided by operating working capital was due to a decline in 2010 accounts receivable balances and an increase in 2010 customer advances and amounts in excess of costs incurred balances. These improvements partially were offset by a decline in accounts payable balances in 2010 compared to 2009. The decline in accounts receivable primarily was due to higher collections on various programs at Electronic Systems, IS&GS, and Space Systems business segments. The increase in customer advances and amounts in excess of costs incurred primarily was attributable to an increase on government and commercial satellite programs at Space Systems and C-130 programs at Aeronautics, partially offset by a decrease on various programs at Electronic Systems. The decrease in accounts payable was attributable to the timing of accounts payable activities across all segments. The reduction in cash from defined benefit pension plans was the result of increased contributions to the pension trust of $758 million as compared to 2009, partially offset by an increase in the CAS costs recovered on our contracts. 38 Table of Contents Investing Activities Capital expenditures The majority of our capital expenditures relate to facilities infrastructure and equipment that are generally incurred to support new and existing programs across all of our business segments. We also incur capital expenditures for IT to support programs and general enterprise IT infrastructure. Capital expenditures for property, plant, and equipment amounted to $814 million in 2011, $820 million in 2010, and $852 million in 2009. Costs associated with the development or purchase of internal-use software amounted to $173 million in 2011, $254 million in 2010, and $314 million in 2009, and have trended downward with the completion of certain infrastructure systems. We expect that our operating cash flows will continue to be sufficient to fund our planned annual capital expenditures over the next few years. Acquisitions, divestitures and other activities Acquisition activities include both the acquisition of businesses and investments in affiliates. We paid $649 million in 2011 for acquisition activities, primarily related to the acquisition of QTC and Sim-Industries B.V. (Note 14), compared to amounts paid in 2010 of $148 million primarily related to investments in affiliates. In 2009, we paid $435 million for acquisition activities. In 2010, we received proceeds of $798 million from the sale of EIG, net of $17 million in transaction costs (Note 14). There were no material divestiture activities in 2011 or 2009. During 2011, we decreased our short-term investments by $510 million compared to an increase of $171 million in 2010. Financing Activities Share activity and dividends We paid cash totaling $2.5 billion for share repurchases during 2011, which included $63 million for shares we repurchased in December 2010 but that were not paid for until January 2011. In 2010 and 2009, we paid cash totaling $2.4 billion and $1.9 billion for share repurchases. Our share repurchase program provides for the repurchase of our common stock from time-to-time. Under the program, we have discretion to determine the dollar amount of shares to be repurchased and the timing of any repurchases in compliance with applicable law and regulation. In 2011, our Board authorized an additional $3.5 billion for share repurchases, bringing the total authorized amount under the program to $6.5 billion (Note 11). As of December 31, 2011, we had repurchased a total of 43.0 million shares under the program for $3.2 billion, and there remained $3.3 billion available for additional share repurchases. We paid our stockholders cash dividends of $1.1 billion in 2011, $969 million in 2010, and $908 million in 2009. We have increased our quarterly dividend rate in each of the last three years, including a 33% increase in the quarterly dividend rate in the fourth quarter of 2011. We declared quarterly dividends of: $.75 per share during each of the first three quarters of 2011 and $1.00 per share for the last quarter; $.63 per share during each of the first three quarters of 2010 and $.75 per share for the last quarter; and $.57 per share during each of the first three quarters of 2009 and $.63 per share for the last quarter. Cash received from the issuance of our common stock in connection with stock option exercises during 2011, 2010, and 2009 totaled $116 million, $59 million, and $40 million. Those activities resulted in the issuance of 2.3 million shares, 1.4 million shares, and 1.0 million shares during the respective periods. Issuance and repayment of long-term debt In 2011, we issued a total of $2.0 billion of long-term notes. We used a portion of the proceeds from the long-term notes that were issued in 2011 to redeem all of our $500 million long-term notes due in 2013 with a fixed coupon rate of 4.12%. In 2011, we repurchased $84 million of our long-term notes through open-market purchases. We paid premiums of $48 million in connection with the early extinguishments of certain long-term notes. In 2009, we issued a total of $1.5 billion of long-term notes, and we paid $242 million in repayments of long-term debt based on scheduled maturities. Capital Structure, Resources, and Other At December 31, 2011, we held cash and cash equivalents of $3.6 billion. Our long-term debt, net of unamortized discounts, amounted to $6.5 billion. As of the end of 2011, our long-term debt bears interest at fixed rates and mainly is in the form of publicly-issued notes. As of December 31, 2011, we were in compliance with all covenants contained in our debt and credit agreements. In 2011, we issued $2.0 billion of long-term notes in a registered public offering consisting of $500 million due in 2016 with a fixed coupon interest rate of 2.13%, $900 million due in 2021 with a fixed coupon interest rate of 3.35%, and $600 million due in 2041 with a fixed coupon interest rate of 4.85%. We used a portion of the proceeds to redeem all of our $500 million long-term notes due in 2013 with a fixed coupon rate of 4.12%. In 2011, we repurchased $84 million of our long-term notes through open-market purchases. We paid premiums of $48 million in connection with the early extinguishments of certain long-term notes. 39 Table of Contents We issued $728 million of new 5.72% Notes due 2040 (the New Notes) in 2010 in exchange for $611 million of our then outstanding debt securities. We paid a premium of $158 million, of which $117 million was in the form of New Notes and $41 million was paid in cash, which was recorded as a discount and is being amortized as additional interest expense over the life of the New Notes using the effective interest method. The New Notes are included on our Balance Sheet net of unamortized discounts. In 2009, we issued a total of $1.5 billion of long-term notes in a registered public offering, $900 million of which are due in 2019 and have a fixed coupon interest rate of 4.25%, and $600 million of which are due in 2039 and have a fixed coupon interest rate of 5.50%. In August 2011, we entered into a new $1.5 billion revolving credit facility with a group of banks and terminated our existing $1.5 billion revolving credit facility which was to expire in June 2012. The new credit facility expires August 2016, and we may request and the banks may grant, at their discretion, an increase to the new credit facility by an additional amount up to $500 million. There were no borrowings outstanding under either facility through December 31, 2011. Borrowings under the new credit facility would be unsecured and bear interest at rates based, at our option, on a Eurodollar rate or a Base Rate, as defined in the new credit facility. Each bank obligation to make loans under the new credit facility is subject to, among other things, our compliance with various representations, warranties and covenants, including covenants limiting our ability and certain of our subsidiaries ability to encumber assets and a covenant not to exceed a maximum leverage ratio, as defined in the new credit facility. We have agreements in place with banking institutions to provide for the issuance of commercial paper. There were no commercial paper borrowings outstanding during the year ended December 31, 2011. If we were to issue commercial paper, the borrowings would be supported by the new credit facility. We also have an effective shelf registration statement on Form S-3 on file with the Securities and Exchange Commission through August 2014 to provide for the issuance of an indeterminate amount of debt securities. We actively seek to finance our business in a manner that preserves financial flexibility while minimizing borrowing costs to the extent practicable. We review changes in financial market and economic conditions to manage the types, amounts, and maturities of our indebtedness. We may at times refinance existing indebtedness, vary our mix of variable-rate and fixed-rate debt, or seek alternative financing sources for our cash and operational needs. Our stockholders equity was $1.0 billion at December 31, 2011, a decrease of $2.5 billion from December 31, 2010. The decrease primarily was due to the repurchase of 31.8 million common shares for $2.4 billion, dividends declared of $1.1 billion during the year, and net adjustments related to our postretirement benefit plans, including the annual December 31 re-measurement adjustment of $2.9 billion, which on a net basis increased the accumulated other comprehensive loss by $2.2 billion. These decreases partially were offset by net earnings of $2.7 billion, and employee stock activity of $596 million. As we repurchase our common shares, we reduce common stock for the $1 of par value of the shares repurchased, with the remainder of the purchase price over par value recorded as a reduction of additional paid-in capital. Due to the volume of repurchases made under our share repurchase program, additional paid-in capital was reduced to zero, with the remainder of the excess of purchase price over par value of $1.8 billion recorded as a reduction of retained earnings. 40 Table of Contents Contractual Commitments and Off-Balance Sheet Arrangements At December 31, 2011, we had contractual commitments to repay debt, make payments under operating leases, settle obligations related to agreements to purchase goods and services, and settle tax and other liabilities. Capital lease obligations were negligible. Payments due under these obligations and commitments are as follows: Payments Due By Period (In millions) Total Less Than 1 Year Years 2 and 3 Years 4 and 5 After 5 Years Long-term debt (a) $ 6,934 $ $ 153 $ 954 $ 5,827 Interest payments 6,756 378 736 713 4,929 Other liabilities 2,379 278 451 282 1,368 Operating lease obligations 1,017 264 339 168 246 Purchase obligations: Operating activities 25,109 16,336 7,451 817 505 Capital expenditures 218 162 56 Total contractual cash obligations $ 42,413 $ 17,418 $ 9,186 $ 2,934 $ 12,875 (a) Long-term debt includes scheduled principal payments only. Amounts related to other liabilities represent the contractual obligations for certain long-term liabilities recorded as of December 31, 2011. Such amounts mainly include expected payments under deferred compensation plans, non-qualified pension plans, environmental liabilities, and business acquisition agreements. Purchase obligations related to operating activities include agreements and contracts that give the supplier recourse to us for cancellation or nonperformance under the contract or contain terms that would subject us to liquidated damages. Such agreements and contracts may, for example, be related to direct materials, obligations to subcontractors, and outsourcing arrangements. Total purchase obligations in the preceding table include approximately $23.2 billion related to contractual commitments entered into as a result of contracts we have with our U.S. Government customers. The U.S. Government generally would be required to pay us for any costs we incur relative to these commitments if they were to terminate the related contracts for convenience under the FAR, subject to available funding. This also would be true in cases where we perform subcontract work for a prime contractor under a U.S. Government contract. The termination for convenience language also may be included in contracts with foreign, state, and local governments. We also have contracts with customers that do not include termination for convenience provisions, including contracts with commercial customers. Purchase obligations in the preceding table for capital expenditures generally include amounts for facilities and equipment related to customer contracts. We also may enter into industrial cooperation agreements, sometimes referred to as offset agreements, as a condition to obtaining orders for our products and services from certain customers in foreign countries. These agreements are designed to enhance the social and economic environment of the foreign country by requiring the contractor to promote investment in the country. Offset agreements may be satisfied through activities that do not require us to use cash, including transferring technology, providing manufacturing and other consulting support to in-country projects, and the purchase by third parties ( e.g., our vendors) of supplies from in-country vendors. These agreements also may be satisfied through our use of cash for such activities as purchasing supplies from in-country vendors, providing financial support for in-country projects, and building or leasing facilities for in-country operations. We typically do not commit to offset agreements until orders for our products or services are definitive. The amounts ultimately applied against our offset agreements are based on negotiations with the customer and typically require cash outlays that represent only a fraction of the original amount in the offset agreement. At December 31, 2011, we had outstanding offset agreements totaling $7.6 billion, primarily related to our Aeronautics and Electronic Systems segments, some of which extend through 2025. To the extent we have entered into purchase obligations at December 31, 2011 that also satisfy offset agreements, those amounts are included in the preceding table. Offset programs usually extend over several years and may provide for penalties in the event we fail to perform in accordance with offset requirements. We historically have not been required to pay material penalties. In connection with our 50% ownership interest of United Launch Alliance, L.L.C. (ULA), we and The Boeing Company (Boeing) have each received distributions totaling $352 million (since ULA formation in December 2006) which are subject to agreements between us, Boeing, and ULA, whereby, if ULA does not have sufficient cash resources or credit capacity to make payments under the inventory supply agreement it has with Boeing, both we and Boeing would provide to 41 Table of Contents ULA, in the form of an additional capital contribution, the level of funding required for ULA to make those payments. Any such capital contributions would not exceed the amount of the distributions subject to the agreements. We currently believe that ULA will have sufficient operating cash flows and credit capacity, including access to its $400 million revolving credit agreement from third-party financial institutions, to meet its obligations such that we would not be required to make a contribution under these agreements. In addition, both we and Boeing have cross-indemnified each other for certain financial support arrangements ( e.g. , letters of credit or surety bonds provided by either party) and guarantees by us and Boeing of the performance and financial obligations of ULA under certain launch service contracts. We believe ULA will be able to fully perform its obligations, as it has done through December 31, 2011, and that it will not be necessary to make payments under the cross-indemnities or guarantees. We have entered into standby letters of credit, surety bonds, and third-party guarantees with financial institutions and other third parties primarily relating to advances received from customers and/or the guarantee of future performance on certain of our contracts. In some cases, we may guarantee the contractual performance of third parties such as joint venture partners. At December 31, 2011, we had the following outstanding letters of credit, surety bonds, and guarantees: Commitment Expiration By Period (In millions) Total Commitment Less Than 1 Year (a) Years 2 and 3 (a) Years 4 and 5 (a) After 5 Years (a) Standby letters of credit $ 2,675 $ 2,245 $ 300 $ 120 $ 10 Surety bonds 367 367 Guarantees 907 1 25 323 558 Total commitments $ 3,949 $ 2,613 $ 325 $ 443 $ 568 (a) Approximately $2.1 billion, $53 million, and $3 million of standby letters of credit in the Less Than 1 Year, Years 2 and 3, and Years 4 and 5, periods, and approximately $32 million of surety bonds, are expected to renew for additional periods until completion of the contractual obligation. Included in the table above is approximately $309 million representing letter of credit amounts for which related obligations or liabilities are also recorded on the Balance Sheet, either as reductions of inventories, as customer advances and amounts in excess of costs incurred, or as other liabilities. Approximately $1.8 billion of the standby letters of credit were issued to secure advance payments received under an F-16 contract from an international customer. These letters of credit are available for draw down in the event of our nonperformance, and the amount available will be reduced as certain events occur throughout the period of performance in accordance with the contract terms. Similar to the letters of credit for the F-16 contract, other letters of credit and surety bonds are available for draw down in the event of our nonperformance. Approximately 85% of the $907 million in third-party guarantees outstanding at December 31, 2011 related to guarantees of the contractual performance of joint ventures to which we currently are or previously were a party. This amount represents our estimate of the maximum amount we would expect to incur upon the contractual non-performance of the joint venture partners. We evaluate the reputation, technical capabilities, and credit quality of potential joint venture partners. In addition, we generally have cross-indemnities in place that may enable us to recover amounts that may be paid on behalf of a joint venture partner. We believe our current and former joint venture partners will be able to perform their obligations, as they have done through December 31, 2011, and that it will not be necessary to make payments under the guarantees. Critical Accounting Policies Contract Accounting / Sales Recognition Approximately 90% of our net sales are derived from long-term contracts for design, development, and production activities (also referred to as DD&P contracts) and services provided to the U.S. Government, and FMS conducted through the U.S. Government. Approximately 95% of our net sales, including net sales related to DD&P contracts with non-U.S. Government customers, are accounted for using the POC method. The POC model requires that significant estimates and assumptions be made in accounting for the contracts. Our remaining net sales are derived from contracts to provide services to non-U.S. Government customers that are not associated with DD&P activities, which we continue to account for under the services accounting model. 42 Table of Contents Beginning January 1, 2011, we evaluate new or significantly modified contracts with customers other than the U.S. Government, to the extent the contracts include multiple elements, to determine if the individual deliverables should be accounted for as separate units of accounting. When we determine that accounting for the deliverables as separate units is appropriate, we allocate the contract value to the deliverables based on their relative estimated selling prices. The contracts or contract modifications we evaluate for multiple elements typically are long term in nature and include the provision of both DD&P activities and services. Based on the nature of our business, we generally account for components of such contracts using the POC accounting model or the services accounting model, as appropriate. This change in accounting has not had a material effect on our financial results, and is not expected to have a material effect in future periods. We classify net sales as products or services on our Statements of Earnings based on the predominant attributes of the underlying contract. Most of our long-term contracts are denominated in U.S. dollars, including contracts for sales of military products and services to foreign governments conducted through the U.S. Government. We record sales for both DD&P activities and services under cost-reimbursable, fixed-price, and time-and-materials contracts. Contract Types Cost-reimbursable contracts Cost-reimbursable contracts, which accounted for about 50% of our total net sales in 2011, provide for the payment of allowable costs incurred during performance of the contract plus a fee, up to a ceiling based on the amount that has been funded. We generate revenue under two general types of cost-reimbursable contracts: cost-plus-award-fee/incentive fee (which represent a substantial majority of our cost-reimbursable contracts) and cost-plus-fixed-fee contracts. Cost-plus-award-fee contracts provide for an award fee that varies within specified limits based on the customer assessment of our performance against a predetermined set of criteria, such as targets based on cost, quality, technical, and schedule criteria. Cost-plus-incentive-fee contracts provide for reimbursement of costs plus a fee which is adjusted by a formula based on the relationship of total allowable costs to total target costs (incentive based on cost) or reimbursement of costs plus an incentive to exceed stated performance targets (incentive based on performance). The fixed fee in a cost-plus-fixed-fee contract is negotiated at the inception of the contract and that fixed fee does not vary with actual costs. Fixed-price and other contracts Under fixed-price contracts, which accounted for about 45% of our total net sales in 2011, we agree to perform the specified work for a pre-determined price. To the extent our actual costs vary from the estimates upon which the price was negotiated, we will generate more or less profit, or could incur a loss. Some fixed-price contracts have a performance-based component under which we may earn incentive payments or incur financial penalties based on our performance. Under time-and-materials contracts, which accounted for about 5% of our total net sales in 2011, we are paid a fixed hourly rate for each direct labor hour expended, and we are reimbursed for allowable material costs and allowable out-of-pocket expenses. To the extent our actual direct labor and associated costs vary in relation to the fixed hourly billing rates provided in the contract, we will generate more or less profit, or could incur a loss. POC Method of Accounting We record net sales and an estimated profit on a POC basis for cost-reimbursable and fixed-price contracts for DD&P activities, and services contracts with the U.S. Government. The POC method for DD&P contracts depends on the nature of the products provided under the contract. For example, for contracts that require us to perform a significant level of development effort in comparison to the total value of the contract and/or to deliver minimal quantities, sales are recorded using the cost-to-cost method to measure progress toward completion. Under the cost-to-cost method of accounting, we recognize sales and an estimated profit as costs are incurred based on the proportion that the incurred costs bear to total estimated costs. For contracts that require us to provide a substantial number of similar items without a significant level of development, we record sales and an estimated profit on a POC basis using units-of-delivery as the basis to measure progress toward completing the contract. For contracts to provide services to the U.S. Government, sales are generally recorded using the cost-to-cost method. Award fees and incentives, as well as penalties related to contract performance, are considered in estimating sales and profit rates on contracts accounted for under the POC method. Estimates of award fees are based on past experience and 43 Table of Contents anticipated performance. We record incentives or penalties when there is sufficient information to assess anticipated contract performance. Incentive provisions that increase or decrease earnings based solely on a single significant event are not recognized until the event occurs. Accounting for contracts under the POC method requires judgment relative to assessing risks, estimating contract revenues and costs (including estimating award and incentive fees and penalties related to performance), and making assumptions for schedule and technical issues. Due to the number of years it may take to complete many of our contracts and the scope and nature of the work required to be performed on those contracts, the estimation of total revenue and cost at completion is complicated and subject to many variables. Contract costs include material, labor, and subcontracting costs, as well as an allocation of indirect costs. For many of our contracts, we are only able to estimate costs in ranges of amounts. Those ranges are based on assumptions we make for variables such as labor productivity and availability, the complexity of the work to be performed, the availability of materials, the length of time to complete the contract (to estimate increases in wages and prices for materials), performance by our subcontractors, and the availability and timing of funding from our customer, among other variables. When estimates of total costs to be incurred on a contract exceed total estimates of revenue to be earned, a provision for the entire loss on the contract is recorded in the period in which the loss is determined. At the outset of each contract, we estimate the initial profit booking rate. The initial profit booking rate of each contract is based on the initial estimated costs at completion considering risks surrounding the ability to achieve the technical requirements (for example, a newly-developed product versus a mature product), schedule (for example, the number and type of milestone events), and costs by contract requirements. Business segment personnel evaluate our contracts through periodic reviews. Management personnel independent from the business segment performing work under the contract also perform recurring evaluations of technical matters, scheduling, and contract costs. Profit booking rates may increase during the performance of the contract if we successfully retire risks surrounding the technical, schedule, and costs aspects of the contract. Likewise, the profit booking rate may decrease if we are not successful in retiring risks; and, as a result, our estimated costs at completion increase. All of the estimates are subject to change during the performance of the contract and, therefore, may affect the profit booking rate. When adjustments in estimated contract revenues or estimated costs at completion are required, any changes from prior estimates are recognized in the current period for the inception-to-date effect of the changes. For example, if we increase the estimated profit booking rate on a cost-reimbursable contract, the increase in sales and operating profit for that contract will reflect a higher return on sales in the current period due to the recognition of the higher profit booking rate on both current period costs, as well as previously incurred costs. As examples of how changes in profit booking rates can affect our financial statements, our net profit booking rate adjustments increased operating profit, net of state taxes, by approximately $1.6 billion, $1.4 billion, and $1.6 billion for 2011, 2010, and 2009, as we were able to successfully retire risks across a broad portfolio of contracts in those periods. Services Method of Accounting For cost-reimbursable contracts for services to non-U.S. Government customers that provide for award and incentive fees, we record net sales as services are performed, exclusive of award and incentive fees. Award and incentive fees are recorded when they are fixed or determinable, generally at the date the amount is communicated to us by the customer. This approach results in the recognition of such fees at contractual intervals (typically every six months) throughout the contract and is dependent on the customer processes for notification of awards and issuance of formal notifications. Under a fixed-price service contract, we are paid a predetermined fixed amount for a specified scope of work and generally have full responsibility for the costs associated with the contract and the resulting profit or loss. We record net sales under fixed-price service contracts on a straight-line basis over the period of contract performance, unless evidence suggests that net sales are earned or the obligations are fulfilled in a different pattern. Costs for all service contracts are expensed as incurred. Other Contract Accounting Considerations The majority of our sales are driven by pricing based on costs incurred to produce products or perform services under contracts with the U.S. Government. Cost-based pricing is determined under the Federal Acquisition Regulation (FAR). The FAR provides guidance on the types of costs that are allowable in establishing prices for goods and services under U.S. Government contracts. For example, costs such as those related to charitable contributions, interest expense, and certain advertising and public relations activities are unallowable and, therefore, not recoverable through sales. In addition, we may enter into advance agreements with the U.S. Government that address the subjects of allowability and allocability of costs to 44 Table of Contents contracts for specific matters. For example, most of the environmental costs we incur for environmental remediation related to sites operated in prior years are allocated to our current operations as general and administrative costs under FAR provisions and supporting advance agreements reached with the U.S. Government. We closely monitor compliance with, and the consistent application of, our critical accounting policies related to contract accounting. Costs incurred and allocated to contracts are reviewed for compliance with U.S. Government regulations by our personnel, and are subject to audit by the Defense Contract Audit Agency. Postretirement Benefit Plans Many of our employees are covered by defined benefit pension plans, and we provide certain health care and life insurance benefits to eligible retirees (collectively, postretirement benefit plans see Note 10). The impact of these plans and benefits on our GAAP earnings may be volatile in that the amount of expense we record for our postretirement benefit plans may materially change from year to year because those calculations are sensitive to changes in several key economic assumptions, including interest rates and rates of return on plan assets, and workforce demographics. We recognize on a plan-by-plan basis the funded status of our postretirement benefit plans under GAAP as either an asset or liability on our Balance Sheets, with a corresponding adjustment to accumulated other comprehensive income (loss), net of tax, in stockholders equity. The GAAP funded status is measured as the difference between the fair value of the plan assets and the benefit obligation of the plan. The funding of our pension plans is determined in accordance with the Employee Retirement Income Security Act of 1974 (ERISA), as amended by the Pension Protection Act of 2006 (PPA). Our goal has been to fund the pension plans to a level of at least 80%, as determined by the PPA. The U.S. Government Cost Accounting Standards (CAS) govern the extent to which our pension costs are allocable to and recoverable under contracts with the U.S. Government, including FMS. Different actuarial valuations are used for GAAP, ERISA and CAS resulting in three different measurements of the funded status of our plans. Actuarial Assumptions GAAP requires that the amounts we record related to our plans be computed using actuarial valuations. The primary year-end assumptions used to estimate postretirement benefit plan expense for the following calendar year are the discount rate and the expected long-term rate of return on plan assets for all postretirement benefit plans; the rates of increase in future compensation levels for the participants in our defined benefit pension plans; and the health care cost trend rates for our retiree medical plans. The discount rate we select impacts both the calculation of the benefit obligation at the end of the year and the calculation of net postretirement benefit plan cost in the subsequent year. The difference between the long-term rate of return on plan assets assumption we select and the actual return on plan assets in any given year affects both the funded status of our benefit plans and the calculation of net postretirement benefit plan cost in subsequent years. When reassessing these assumptions each year we consider past and current market conditions, and make judgments about future market trends. We also have to consider factors such as the timing and amounts of expected contributions to the plans and benefit payments to plan participants. We selected 4.75% as the discount rate for calculating our benefit obligations at December 31, 2011 related to our defined benefit pension plans, compared to 5.5% at the end of 2010 and 5.875% at the end of 2009. We selected 4.50% as the discount rate for calculating our benefit obligations at December 31, 2011 related to our retiree medical plans, compared to 5.5% at the end of 2010 and 5.875% at the end of 2009. We evaluate several data points in order to arrive at an appropriate discount rate, including results from cash flow models, quoted rates from long-term bond indices, and changes in long-term bond rates over the past year. As part of our evaluation, we calculate the approximate average yields on securities that were selected to match our projected postretirement benefit plan cash flows. Our postretirement benefit plan cash flows are input into actuarial models that include data for corporate bonds rated AA or better. We concluded that 8.0% was a reasonable estimate for the expected long-term rate of return on plan assets assumption at December 31, 2011, as compared to 8.5% used in prior years. The expected long-term rate of return assumption was adjusted downward due to the impact sovereign debt among developed countries may have on the rate of economic growth. The long-term rate of return assumption represents the expected average rate of earnings on the funds invested, or to be invested, to provide for the benefits included in the plan obligation. This assumption is based on several factors including historical market index returns, the anticipated long-term allocation of plan assets, the historical return data for the trust funds, plan expenses, and the potential to outperform market index returns. The actual return in any specific year likely will differ from the assumption, but the average expected return over a long-term future horizon should be approximately equal to the assumption. As a result, changes in this assumption are less frequent than changes in the discount rate. 45 Table of Contents Our stockholders equity has been reduced by $11.2 billion from the annual year-end measurement of the funded status of our postretirement benefit plans, inclusive of the December 31, 2011 adjustment of $2.9 billion. These noncash, after-tax amounts primarily represent net actuarial losses resulting from declines in discount rates and differences between actual experience and our actuarial assumptions, which will be amortized to expense in future periods. During 2011, $666 million of these amounts was recognized as a component of our postretirement benefit plans expense and $812 million is expected to be recognized as expense in 2012. We expect that our 2012 pension expense will increase to $1.9 billion as compared with 2011 pension expense of $1.8 billion, primarily due to an increase in the amortization of net actuarial gains and losses caused by the decrease in the discount rate mentioned above. The discount rate assumption we select at the end of each year is based on our best estimates and judgment. A reasonably possible change of plus or minus 25 basis points in the 4.75% discount rate assumption at December 31, 2011, with all other assumptions held constant, would have decreased or increased the amount of the qualified pension benefit obligation we recorded at the end of 2011 by approximately $1.3 billion, which would have resulted in an after-tax increase or decrease in stockholders equity at the end of the year of approximately $850 million. If the 4.75% discount rate at December 31, 2011 that was used to compute the expected 2012 expense for our qualified defined benefit pension plans had been 25 basis points higher or lower, with all other assumptions held constant, the amount of expense projected for 2012 would be lower or higher by approximately $125 million. Funding Considerations The PPA became applicable to us and other large U.S. defense contractors beginning in 2011 and had the effect of accelerating the required amount of annual pension plan contributions. We made contributions related to our qualified defined benefit pension plans of $2.3 billion in 2011, $2.2 billion in 2010, and $1.5 billion in 2009. We recovered $899 million in 2011, $988 million in 2010 and $580 million in 2009 as CAS costs. Amounts funded under CAS are recovered over time through the pricing of our products and services on U.S. Government contracts, including FMS, and are recognized in our cost of sales and net sales. Amounts contributed in excess of the CAS funding requirements, over $3.0 billion, are considered to be prepayment credits under the CAS rules. We expect to make contributions of $1.1 billion related to our qualified defined benefit pension plans in 2012 and anticipate recovering $1.1 billion as CAS cost in 2012 which is consistent with our anticipated contributions. We may review options for further contributions in 2012. The CAS Board published its revised pension accounting rules (CAS Harmonization) with an effective date of February 27, 2012 to better align the recovery of pension contributions, including prepayment credits, on U.S. Government contracts with the accelerated funding requirements of the PPA. The CAS Harmonization rules will increase our CAS cost beginning in 2013. There is a transition period during which the cost impact of the new rules will be phased in, with the full impact occurring in 2017. While we expect our 2013 CAS costs to be higher than our estimate for 2012 of $1.1 billion, the estimated incremental impact of CAS Harmonization in 2013 will be a very modest cost increase, with much larger increases occurring successively in years 2014 through 2017. Based upon current assumptions which may change, the increase in CAS costs caused by CAS Harmonization should result in increased earnings a few years from now, as our CAS costs should be in excess of the pension expense we record under GAAP. Accordingly, our non-cash FAS/CAS pension adjustment, discussed further in the Discussion of Business Segments section above, should eventually increase earnings rather than decrease earnings as it has the past few years. In addition, the increase in CAS costs should eventually cause our CAS costs to be greater than our pension contributions as we recover the prepayment credits, which should increase our cash flow from operations. Environmental Matters We are a party to various agreements, proceedings, and potential proceedings for environmental cleanup issues, including matters at various sites where we have been designated a potentially responsible party (PRP) by the EPA or by a state agency. At the end of 2011, the total amount of liabilities recorded on our Balance Sheet for environmental matters was $932 million. We have recorded receivables totaling $808 million at December 31, 2011 for the portion of environmental costs that are probable of future recovery in pricing of our products and services for agencies of the U.S. Government, as discussed below. The amount that is expected to be allocated to our non-U.S. Government contracts or that is determined to be unallowable for pricing under U.S. Government contracts has been expensed through cost of sales. We project costs and recovery of costs over approximately twenty years. 46 Table of Contents We enter into agreements ( e.g., administrative orders, consent decrees) that document the extent and timing of our environmental remediation obligation. We also are involved in remediation activities at environmental sites where formal agreements either do not exist or do not quantify the extent and timing of our obligation. Environmental cleanup activities usually span many years, which makes estimating the costs more judgmental due to, for example, changing remediation technologies. To determine the costs related to cleanup sites, we have to assess the extent of contamination, effects on natural resources, the appropriate technology to be used to accomplish the remediation, and evolving regulatory environmental standards. We perform quarterly reviews of environmental remediation sites and record liabilities and receivables in the period it becomes probable that a liability has been incurred and the amounts can be reasonably estimated (see the discussion under Environmental Matters in Notes 1 and 13 to the financial statements). We consider the above factors in our quarterly estimates of the timing and amount of any future costs that may be required for remediation actions, which generally results in the calculation of a range of estimates for a particular environmental site. We do not discount the recorded liabilities, as the amount and timing of future cash payments are not fixed or cannot be reliably determined. Given the required level of judgment and estimation, it is likely that materially different amounts could be recorded if different assumptions were used or if circumstances were to change ( e.g., a change in environmental standards or a change in our estimate of the extent of contamination). Both the EPA and the California Office of Environmental Health Hazard Assessment announced plans in January 2011 to regulate two chemicals, perchlorate and hexavalent chromium, to levels in drinking water that are expected to be substantially lower than the existing public health goals or standards established in California. The rulemaking process is a lengthy one and may take one or more years to complete. If a substantially lower standard is adopted, we would expect a material increase in our estimates for remediation at several existing sites. Under agreements reached with the U.S. Government, most of the amounts we spend for environmental remediation are allocated to our operations as general and administrative costs. Under existing government regulations, these and other environmental expenditures relating to our U.S. Government business, after deducting any recoveries received from insurance or other PRPs, are allowable in establishing prices of our products and services. As a result, most of the expenditures we incur are included in our net sales and cost of sales according to U.S. Government agreement or regulation, regardless of the contract form ( e.g. cost-reimbursable, fixed price). We continually evaluate the recoverability of our environmental receivables by assessing, among other factors, U.S. Government regulations, our U.S. Government business base and contract mix, and our history of receiving reimbursement of such costs. As disclosed above, we may record changes in the amount of environmental remediation liabilities as a result of our quarterly reviews of the status of our environmental remediation sites, which would result in a change to the corresponding environmental receivable and a charge to earnings. For example, if we were to determine that the liabilities should be increased by $100 million, the corresponding receivables would be increased by approximately $87 million, with the remainder recorded as a charge to earnings. This allocation is determined annually, based upon our existing and projected business activities with the U.S. Government. We cannot reasonably determine the extent of our financial exposure at all environmental sites with which we are involved. There are a number of former operating facilities we are monitoring or investigating for potential future remediation. In some cases, although a loss may be probable, it is not possible at this time to reasonably estimate the amount of any obligation for remediation activities because of uncertainties ( e.g ., assessing the extent of the contamination). During any particular quarter, such uncertainties may be resolved to allow us to estimate and recognize the initial liability to remediate a particular former operating site. The amount of the liability could be material. Upon recognition of the liability, a portion will be recognized as a receivable with the remainder charged to operations. If we are ultimately found to have liability at those sites where we have been designated a PRP, we expect that the actual costs of remediation will be shared with other liable PRPs. Generally, PRPs that are ultimately determined to be responsible parties are strictly liable for site cleanup and usually agree among themselves to share, on an allocated basis, the costs and expenses for investigation and remediation. Under existing environmental laws, responsible parties are jointly and severally liable and, therefore, we are potentially liable for the full cost of funding such remediation. In the unlikely event that we were required to fund the entire cost of such remediation, the statutory framework provides that we may pursue rights of cost recovery or contribution from the other PRPs. The amounts we record do not reflect the fact that we may recover some of the environmental costs we have incurred through insurance or from other PRPs, which we are required to pursue by agreement and U.S. Government regulation. 47 Table of Contents Goodwill Our goodwill at December 31, 2011 and 2010 amounted to $10.1 billion and $9.6 billion. We review goodwill for impairment on an annual basis and whenever events or changes in circumstances indicate the carrying value of goodwill may not be recoverable. Such events or circumstances could include significant changes in the business climate of our industry, operating performance indicators, competition, or sale or disposal of a portion of a reporting unit. The assessment is performed at the reporting unit level. Our annual testing date is October 1. Performing the goodwill impairment test requires judgment, including how we define reporting units and determine their fair value. We consider a component of our business to be a reporting unit if it constitutes a business for which discrete financial information is available and management regularly reviews the operating results of that component. We estimate the fair value of each reporting unit using a combination of a discounted cash flow (DCF) analysis and market-based valuation methodologies. Determining fair value requires the exercise of significant judgments, including judgments about appropriate discount rates, perpetual growth rates, relevant comparable company earnings multiples and the amount and timing of expected future cash flows. The cash flows employed in the DCF analyses are based on our best estimate of future sales and operating costs, based primarily on existing firm orders, expected future orders, contracts with suppliers, labor agreements, and general market conditions. The discount rate applied to our forecasts of future cash flows is based on our estimated weighted average cost of capital. In assessing the reasonableness of our determined fair values, we evaluate our results against other value indicators such as comparable company public trading values, research analyst estimates and values observed in market transactions. Changes in these estimates and assumptions could materially affect the determination of fair value and/or goodwill impairment for each reporting unit. We evaluate goodwill for impairment by comparing the estimated fair value of a reporting unit to its carrying value, including goodwill. If the carrying value exceeds the estimated fair value, we measure impairment by comparing the derived fair value of goodwill to its carrying value, and any impairment determined is recorded in the current period. We completed our assessment of goodwill as of October 1, 2011 and determined that the estimated fair value of each reporting unit exceeded its corresponding carrying amount and, as such, no impairment existed at that date. Changes in estimates and assumptions we make in conducting our goodwill assessment could affect the estimated fair value of one or more of our reporting units and could result in a goodwill impairment charge in a future period. However, we currently do not believe that any of our reporting units are at risk of failing a goodwill impairment test in the near term, as their fair values are significantly greater than their carrying values. Recent Accounting Pronouncements The Financial Accounting Standards Board (FASB) has issued new accounting standards that are not effective until after December 31, 2011.
