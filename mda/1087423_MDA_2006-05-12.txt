ITEM 7. MANAGEMENT S DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS OF FINANCIAL CONDITION AND RESULTS OF OPERATIONS OVERVIEW We are a global leader in providing open source software solutions to the enterprise, including our enterprise-ready open source operating system platforms. Open source software is an alternative to proprietary software and represents a different model for the development and licensing of commercial software code than that typically used for proprietary software. Because open source software code is freely shared, there are no licensing fees for the distribution of the open source software. Therefore, we do not recognize revenue from the licensing of the code itself. We provide value to our customers through the aggregation, integration, testing, certification, delivery, maintenance and support of our Red Hat enterprise technologies, and by providing a level of scalability, stability and accountability for the enterprise technologies we package and distribute. Moreover, because communities of developers not employed by us assist with the creation of our open source offerings, opportunities for further innovation of our offerings are supplemented by these communities. We sell our enterprise technologies, such as our operating system platform, Enterprise Linux, through subscriptions, and we recognize revenue over the period of the subscription agreements with our customers. In addition, we provide certain managed services for each of our enterprise technologies, through RHN, as a component of our subscriptions. We market our offerings primarily to enterprise customers including large enterprises, government organizations, small and medium size businesses and educational institutions. We have focused on introducing and gaining acceptance for Red Hat enterprise technologies that comprise our open source architecture. Since introducing our initial enterprise open source operating system platform, Enterprise Linux, it has gained widespread ISV and IHV support. We have continued to build our open source architecture by expanding our enterprise operating system platform offerings and introducing new systems management services, clustering capability, file management systems, directory and certificate technologies and enhanced security functionality. We intend to bring the value of open source technology to other key areas of the enterprise infrastructure as the development community efforts support and customer needs dictate. We derive our revenues and generate cash from customers primarily from two sources: (i) subscription revenue and (ii) training and services revenue, as described under Critical Accounting Policies below. We no longer sell retail products. The arrangements with our customers that create enterprise subscription revenues are explained in further detail under Critical Accounting Policies below and in NOTE 2 to the Consolidated Financial Statements. These arrangements typically involve subscriptions to Enterprise Linux or other enterprise technologies. Our revenues are affected by, among other factors, corporate, government and consumer spending levels. In evaluating the performance of our business, we consider a number of factors, including total revenues, deferred revenues, operating income, operating margin and cash flows from operations. Revenue. For the year ended February 28, 2006, total revenue increased 41.7% to $278.3 million from $196.5 million for the year ended February 28, 2005. This increase resulted from an increasing level of adoption of Enterprise Linux as a primary computing platform by the larger enterprise customers, as well as growing penetration of the small and mid-sized business market and increased adoption of other Red Hat enterprise technologies. The success of our business model is predicated on the acceptance and widespread deployment of Enterprise Linux as a significant platform by the large enterprises, our ability to generate subscription revenues on a per installed system basis for Red Hat enterprise technology, our ability to increase annual average subscription revenues per customer by providing additional value to our customers in the form of additional technology infrastructure and by providing customers with additional services. 31 Deferred Revenue. Our deferred revenue, current and long-term, balance at February 28, 2006 was $223.5 million. Because of our subscription model and revenue recognition policies, deferred revenues improve predictability of future revenues. Deferred revenues at February 28, 2006 have increased by more than 62.8% as compared to the balance at February 28, 2005 of $137.3 million. Subscriptions. Our enterprise technologies are sold under subscription agreements. These agreements typically have a one or three year subscription period. The subscription entitles the end user to maintenance, which consists of a specified level of support, as well as security errata, bug fixes, functionality enhancements and upgrades to the technology, when and if available, during the term of the subscription through RHN. Our customers have the ability to purchase higher levels of subscriptions that increase the level of support the customer is entitled to receive. Subscription revenue increased each quarter of fiscal 2006, 2005 and 2004, and is being driven primarily by the increased market acceptance and use of open source software by the enterprise and our expansion of sales channels during these periods. Sales by geography. We operate our business in three geographic regions: The Americas (U.S., Latin America and Canada); EMEA (Europe, Middle East and Africa); and Asia Pacific (principally Singapore, Japan, India, Australia, Korea and China). In fiscal 2006, $98.7 million or 35.5% of our revenue was generated outside the United States compared to $64.3 million or 33.0% in fiscal 2005. While our revenue in both EMEA and Asia Pacific relative to total revenues for fiscal 2006 did not change significantly when compared to fiscal 2005, the amount of our revenues generated from our international operations is expected to increase as our international sales force and channels become more mature and as we enter new locations or expand our presence in existing locations. We have offices in more than 30 locations throughout the world. Income from operations and operating margin. Income from operations continues to grow as our revenue is growing at a faster pace than our operating expenses. Operating income was 20.9%, 13.7%, and 2.4% of total revenues for the years ended February 28, 2006, February 28, 2005 and February 29, 2004, respectively. Our growing profit margin is a result of both an increase in overall sales volume, as well as a higher mix of subscription revenues which have a higher profit margin than training and services revenues. Subscriptions made up 82.8%, 76.9% and 66.1% of total revenues for the years ended February 28, 2006, February 28, 2005 and February 29, 2004, respectively. The profit margin on subscriptions continues to generally trend upward and was 90.9%, 91.1% and 88.3% for the years ended February 28, 2006, February 28, 2005 and February 29, 2004, respectively. These two trends combined resulted in the improvement of our gross margin to 82.6%, 80.4% and 72.8% for the same periods. During these same periods, operating expense declined as a percentage of revenue further improving our operating margin. Cash, cash equivalents, investments in debt securities and cash flow from operations. Cash, cash equivalents and short term and long term investments in debt securities balances at February 28, 2006 totaled $1.1 billion. During fiscal 2006, we generated $186.6 million in cash flow from operations primarily related to the increase in sales of subscriptions during the period. Our significant cash balance gives us a measure of flexibility to take advantage of opportunities such as acquisition opportunities, increasing investment in international areas and purchasing our own common stock and debt securities. In fiscal 2006, we focused on, and expect in fiscal 2007 to continue to focus on, among other things, (i) gaining widespread acceptance and deployment of Enterprise Linux as a mission-critical operating system platform by the enterprise, (ii) generating increasing subscription revenue on a per installed system basis by renewing subscriptions and providing additional value to our customers and by growing the number of enterprise technologies that comprise our open source architecture and (iii) generating increased revenues by providing additional systems management, developer and other services as well as from additional market penetration through a broader and deeper set of channel partner relationships, including OEMs, and our own international expansion, among other means. 32 CRITICAL ACCOUNTING POLICIES Our critical accounting policies include the following: Revenue recognition; Impairment of long-lived assets; and Deferred taxes. Revenue recognition We recognize revenue in accordance with Statement of Position No. 97-2, Software Revenue Recognition ( SOP 97-2 ), as amended by Statement of Position No. 98-4, Deferral of the Effective Date of a Provision of SOP 97-2, and Statement of Position No. 98-9, Modification of SOP 97-2, and Staff Accounting Bulletin No. 101, as amended by Staff Accounting Bulletin No. 104. We establish persuasive evidence of an arrangement for each type of revenue transaction based on either a signed contract with the end customer, a click-through contract on our website whereby the customer agrees to our standard subscription terms, signed distribution contracts with OEMs and other resellers, or, in the case of individual training seats, through receipt of payment which indicates acceptance of our training agreement terms. Subscription revenue Subscription revenue is comprised of direct and indirect sales of Red Hat enterprise technologies. Retail products are no longer sold. Accounts receivable and deferred revenue are recorded at the time a customer enters into a binding subscription agreement for the purchase of a subscription, subscription services are made available to the customer and the customer is billed. The deferred revenue amount is amortized to revenue over the life of the subscription. Red Hat enterprise technologies are generally offered with either one or three-year base subscription periods; the majority of our subscriptions have one-year terms. Under these subscription agreements, renewal rates are generally specified for one or three year renewal terms. The base subscription entitles the end user to the technology itself and post contract customer support ( PCS ) consisting of a specified level of customer support and security errata, bug fixes, functionality enhancements to the technology and upgrades to new versions of the Red Hat enterprise technologies, each on a when and if available basis, during the term of the subscription. We sell Enterprise Linux through two principal channels: (1) direct, which includes sales by our sales force as well as web store sales, and (2) indirect, which includes distributors, resellers and OEMs. We recognize revenue from the sale of Red Hat enterprise technologies ratably over the period of the subscription beginning on the commencement date of the subscription agreement. We do not sell the Enterprise Linux technology or the components of the PCS that are included in the subscription on a stand alone basis. Subscription arrangements with large enterprise customers often have contracts with multiple elements (e.g., software technology, maintenance, training, consulting and other services). We allocate revenue to each element of the arrangement based on vendor-specific objective evidence of its fair value when we can demonstrate sufficient evidence of the fair value of at least those elements that are undelivered. The fair value of each element in multiple element arrangements is created by either (i) providing the customer with the ability during the term of the arrangement to renew that element at the same rate paid for the element included in the initial term of the agreement or (ii) selling the services on a stand-alone basis. In addition, our subscription revenue is partially derived from sales of our RHN offerings. RHN is a Red Hat-hosted, internet-based set of services used to help promote the security, availability and management of our Red Hat technology solutions as well as provide functionality for managing other technologies. RHN may be subscribed to at the time of, and in addition to, one of our Enterprise Linux offerings or on a stand alone basis. Revenues are recognized ratably over the term of the subscription beginning on the commencement date of the subscription. 33 Through retail distributors, we formerly sold Red Hat Linux consumer products. In accordance with SOP 97-2, the revenue associated with products whose subscription period was 30 days or less was recognized immediately because the cost to us associated with such subscriptions was de minimis. For retail products whose subscription period for support services was greater than 30 days, we recognized the revenue ratably over the period that the subscription services were provided beginning on the estimated date of purchase by the end user. A reserve for sales returns was recognized for sales of retail software products to distributors, who had a right of return, based on our historical experience of sell-through to the end user by the distributor. The predominant portion of our retail distribution agreements provided that distributors only have 90 days from date of original shipment to return unsold product. We recognized revenues from sales of retail products with subscription periods less than 30 days upon shipment to the distributor because we were able to estimate returns with a reasonable degree of accuracy, the fee was fixed or determinable and collection of the resulting receivable was probable. Our retail customers did not receive the right to future upgrades or new versions of the technology. Training and services revenue Training and services are comprised of revenue for consulting, engineering and customer training and education services. Consulting services consist of hourly arrangements, and revenue is recognized as these services are performed. Engineering services represent revenues earned under fixed fee arrangements with our OEM partners and other customers to provide for significant modification and customization of our Red Hat enterprise technologies. We recognize revenues for these fixed fee engineering services using the percentage of completion basis of accounting, provided we have the ability to make reliable estimates of progress towards completion, the fee for such services is fixed or determinable and collection of the resulting receivable is probable. Under the percentage of completion method, earnings under the contract are recognized based on the progress toward completion as estimated using the ratio of labor hours incurred to total expected project hours. Changes in estimates are recognized in the period in which they are known. Revenue for customer training and education services is recognized on the dates the services are complete. Impairment of long-lived assets We evaluate the recoverability of our property and equipment and other assets in accordance with Statement of Financial Accounting Standards No. 144, Accounting for the Impairment or Disposal of Long-Lived Assets ( SFAS 144 ). SFAS 144 requires that one accounting model be used for long-lived assets to be disposed of by sale, whether previously held and used or newly acquired, and broadens the presentation of discontinued operations to include more disposal transactions. An impairment loss is recognized when the net book value of such assets exceeds the estimated future undiscounted cash flows attributable to the assets or the business to which the assets relate. We perform this assessment on an annual basis, typically during the fourth quarter of the fiscal year or whenever events or changes in circumstances indicate an impairment may have occurred. Impairment losses are measured as the amount by which the carrying value exceeds the fair value of the assets. Deferred taxes We account for income taxes using the liability method that requires the recognition of deferred tax assets or liabilities for the temporary differences between financial reporting and tax bases of our assets and liabilities and for tax carryforwards at enacted statutory tax rates in effect for the years in which the differences are expected to reverse. We have recorded a full valuation allowance against the majority of our deferred tax assets due to uncertainty of realization of such deferred tax assets. During the year ended February 28, 2006, we recorded a net tax expense of $2.3 million. We continue to assess the realizability of our deferred tax assets, which primarily consist of net operating losses from stock option expense deductions in the United States. In assessing the realizability of these deferred tax assets, management considers whether it is more likely than not that some portion or all of the deferred tax assets will be realized. In making this assessment, management considers the historical trend of taxable losses, projected future taxable income and the reversal of deferred tax liabilities. As of February 28, 2006, the net 34 deferred tax asset balance was $202.0 million of which $187.7 million is offset by a valuation allowance. We continue to provide a full valuation allowance against our deferred tax assets arising from tax losses in the United States and Asia Pacific due primarily to (i) cumulative tax losses, (ii) uncertainty related to the future amount of stock option exercises and related tax deductions generated, and (iii) inherent difficulties in forecasting future taxable income as a result of rapidly changing technology and our competitive environment. RESULTS OF OPERATIONS Years ended February 28, 2006 and February 28, 2005 The following table is a summary of our results of operations for the years ended February 28, 2006 and February 28, 2005 (in thousands): Year Ended $ Change % Change February 28, 2006 February 28, 2005 Revenue: Subscription revenue $ 230,444 $ 151,125 $ 79,319 52.5 % Training and services revenue 47,886 45,341 2,545 5.6 Total subscription and training and services revenue 278,330 196,466 81,864 41.7 Cost of subscription and training and services revenue: Cost of subscription revenue 21,003 13,488 7,515 55.7 As a % of subscription revenue 9.1 % 8.9 % Cost of training and services revenue 27,504 24,999 2,505 10.0 As a % of training and services revenue 57.4 % 55.1 % Total cost of subscription and training and services revenue 48,507 38,487 10,020 26.0 As a % of total revenue 17.4 % 19.6 % Total gross profit 229,823 157,979 71,844 45.5 As a % of total revenue 82.6 % 80.4 % Operating expense: Sales and marketing 84,723 62,939 21,784 34.6 Research and development 40,883 32,468 8,415 25.9 General and administrative 46,135 35,626 10,509 29.5 Total operating expense 171,741 131,033 40,708 31.1 As a % of total revenue 61.7 % 66.7 % Income from operations 58,082 26,946 31,136 115.5 Other income and expense, net 30,053 24,431 5,622 23.0 Interest expense (6,119 ) (6,436 ) 317 (4.9 ) Income before provision (benefit) for income taxes 82,016 44,941 37,075 82.5 Provision (benefit) for income taxes 2,331 (485 ) 2,816 580.6 Net income $ 79,685 $ 45,426 $ 34,259 75.4 % As a percent of total revenue 28.6 % 23.1 % Revenue Subscription revenue Subscription revenue which is primarily comprised of direct and indirect sales of Red Hat enterprise technologies, increased by 52.5% or $79.3 million from $151.1 million for the year ended February 28, 2005 to $230.4 million for the same period ended February 28, 2006. The increase in subscription revenue is being driven by subscriptions to our principal enterprise technology, Enterprise Linux, which has gained broad market acceptance in mission critical areas of computing and our international expansion, especially in Asia. The increase is a result of the continued migration of larger enterprises in industries such as financial services to our Enterprise Linux platform from a proprietary Unix platform. Such demand has been experienced through all our 35 distribution channels but has been more notably manifested through OEM, distributor and reseller relationships. We expect subscription revenue to continue its upward trend with the increased market acceptance for Linux and our continued international expansion. Training and services revenue Training revenues includes fees paid by our customers for delivery of educational materials and instruction. Services revenue includes fees for services received from customers for deployment of Red Hat enterprise technologies, and for delivery of added functionality to Enterprise Linux or other technologies for our major customers and OEM partners. Training and services revenue increased by 5.6% or $2.5 million from $45.3 million for the year ended February 28, 2005 to $47.9 million for the same period ended February 28, 2006. The adoption of Linux as a primary computing platform increases the need for training and consulting services. Accordingly, training revenues increased by $1.8 million or 5.9% as a result of continued demand for Red Hat Certified Technicians. Additionally, we enabled more resellers to provide our training services which increased the availability of training classes. Professional services revenue increased by $0.8 million or 5.2%, with the majority of the increase related to the deployment of Enterprise Linux. This trend is expected to continue as Enterprise Linux subscription sales continue to grow. Cost of revenue Cost of subscription revenue The cost of subscription revenue primarily consists of expenses we incur to support, distribute, manufacture and package Red Hat enterprise technologies. These costs include labor related cost to provide technical support and maintenance, as well as, cost for fulfillment, physical media, literature, packaging and shipping. Cost of subscription revenue increased by 55.7% or $7.5 million from $13.5 million for the year ended February 28, 2005 to $21.0 for the same period ended February 28, 2006. The increase is the result of continued additions to our technical support staff to meet the demands of our growing subscriber base. Additionally, amortization of intellectual property directly related to the delivery of subscriptions increased by $2.0 million. As the number of Enterprise Linux subscriptions continues to increase, we expect associated support cost will continue to increase, although we anticipate this will occur at a rate slower than that of subscription revenue growth. Cost of training and services revenue Cost of training and services is mainly comprised of personnel and consulting costs for the design, development and delivery of custom engineering and training courses. Cost of training and services revenue increased by 10.0% or $2.5 million from $25.0 million for the year ended February 28, 2005 to $27.5 million for the same period ended February 28, 2006. The majority of the increase is directly related to training and the increased capacity both in educators and classroom space. We anticipate continued increased demand for training for Red Hat Enterprise Certified Engineers, Technicians and Architects. As a result we have also expanded the number of available classes to meet the demand in the coming year. Gross profit Gross profit increased by 45.5% or $71.8 million from $158.0 million for the year ended February 28, 2005 to $229.8 million for the same period ended February 28, 2006. Gross margin was 80.4% and 82.6% of total revenues for the years ended February 28, 2005 and 2006, respectively. The increase in gross profit and gross margin was primarily due to the continued increase in revenue and profitability of our Enterprise Linux subscription offerings and a growing percentage of subscriptions delivered electronically. Operating expenses Sales and marketing Sales and marketing expense consists primarily of salaries and other related costs for sales and marketing personnel, sales commissions, travel, public relations and marketing materials and trade shows. Sales and 36 marketing expense increased by 34.6% or $21.8 million from $62.9 million for the year ended February 28, 2005 to $84.7 million for the same period ended February 28, 2006. This increase was primarily due to a $16.8 million increase in the cost of compensation and travel due to an expansion of our dedicated sales force by 76% from the prior year. Marketing cost also increased by $2.6 million mainly related to additional advertising expenses and promotional sponsorships focused on our major partners. Sales and marketing expense was 32.0% and 30.4% of total revenues for the years ended February 28, 2005 and 2006, respectively. Research and development Research and development expense consists primarily of personnel and related costs for development of software technologies and systems management offerings. Research and development expense increased by 25.9% or $8.4 million from $32.5 million for the year ended February 28, 2005 to $40.9 million for the same period ended February 28, 2006. The increase in research and development resulted from the additional expansion of our engineering group and is mainly compensation and related expenses and consulting fees, which increased $7.2 million and $0.6 million, respectively. This expansion relates to the acquisition of certain assets of Netscape in the fourth quarter of fiscal 2005 and additional engineering resources to support the localization of our product offerings in multiple languages. Research and development expense was 16.5% and 14.7% of total revenues for the years ended February 28, 2005 and 2006, respectively. Investing in research and development has been a priority for Red Hat and we anticipate continued spending as we expand our offerings in clustering and virtualization technology. General and administrative General and administrative expense consists primarily of personnel and related costs for general corporate functions, including finance, accounting, legal, human resources, facilities and information systems expense. General and administrative expense increased by 29.5% or $10.5 million from $35.6 million for the year ended February 28, 2005 to $46.1 million for the same period ended February 28, 2006. The majority of the increase, approximately $7.1 million, is a result of additional headcount across all functions to help the business scale. That increase was partially offset by a $0.7 million decrease in professional services fees in the information systems functions as a number of contractors converted to employees and a $0.5 million decrease in accounting fees relating to Sarbanes-Oxley Section 404 compliance. Facilities cost and depreciation increased by approximately $3.4 million during the year ended February 28, 2006 related to additional office and computer equipment associated with increased staffing. Additionally, we had a loss on disposal of assets of approximately $1.3 million related to disposal of computer equipment and leasehold improvements. Other administrative costs such as bank fees, property taxes, franchise taxes, travel and office supplies cost make up the remainder of the increase. General and administrative expense was 18.1% and 16.6% of total revenues for the years ended February 28, 2005 and 2006, respectively. Other income and expense, net Other income and expense, net consists of interest income earned on cash deposits in money market accounts and invested in short and long-term fixed income instruments, gain on the extinguishment of certain long-term debt, net gains realized on the sale of investments and foreign currency revaluation gains and losses. Other income and expense, net increased by 23.0% or $5.6 million from $24.4 million for the year ended February 28, 2005 to $30.1 million for the same period ended February 28, 2006. The increase is primarily related to a $5.6 million increase in interest income and a $3.1 million net gain recognized on the extinguishment of long-term debt during the year ended February 28, 2006. The increase in interest income is primarily attributable to higher rates of return and higher cash and investment balances. This increase is partially offset by a decrease of $2.2 million in realized gains on the sale of investments and losses of $1.4 million related to the write down of certain other long-term investments. Interest expense Interest expense primarily consists of interest and the related amortization of deferred debt issuance costs associated with the convertible debentures. During the year ended February 28, 2006, interest expense decreased 37 4.9% or $0.3 million from $6.4 million in the year ended February 28, 2005 to $6.1 million for the same period ended February 28, 2006. The decrease resulted from the repurchase of convertible debentures. During the year ended February 28, 2006, the Company repurchased $30.0 million of the $600.0 million of outstanding long-term debentures. Income taxes During the year ended February 28, 2006, we recorded $2.3 million of income tax expense, which resulted in an effective rate of 2.8%. Our effective tax rate differs from the U.S. federal statutory rate of 35% primarily due to U.S. net operating loss carryforwards. The provision for income tax expense for the year ended February 28, 2006, consists of foreign income tax expense. We recorded $4.3 million of foreign income tax expense and recognized a $2.0 million deferred tax benefit, due to foreign net operating losses. There was no provision for U.S. income tax expense primarily as a result of stock option exercises and related tax deductions reported during the fiscal quarter ended February 28, 2006. See NOTE 12 to the Consolidated Financial Statements. Years ended February 28, 2005 and February 29, 2004 The following table is a summary of our results of operations for the years ended February 28, 2005 and February 29, 2004 (in thousands): Year Ended $ Change % Change February 28, 2005 February 29, 2004 Revenue: Subscription revenue $ 151,125 $ 82,408 $ 68,717 83.4 % Training and services revenue 45,341 42,329 3,012 7.1 Total subscription and training and services revenue 196,466 124,737 71,729 57.5 Cost of subscription and training and services revenue: Cost of subscription revenue 13,488 9,668 3,820 39.5 As a % of subscription revenue 8.9 % 11.7 % Cost of training and services revenue 24,999 24,268 731 3.0 As a % of training and services revenue 55.1 % 57.3 % Total cost of subscription and training and services revenue 38,487 33,936 4,551 13.4 As a % of total revenue 19.6 % 27.2 % Total gross profit 157,979 90,801 67,178 73.98 As a % of total revenue 80.4 % 72.8 % Operating expense: Sales and marketing 62,939 40,922 22,017 53.8 Research and development 32,468 26,483 5,985 22.6 General and administrative 35,626 20,450 15,176 74.2 Total operating expense 131,033 87,855 43,178 49.2 As a % of total revenue 66.7 % 70.4 % Income from operations 26,946 2,946 24,000 814.7 Other income and expense, net 24,431 11,866 12,565 105.9 Interest expense (6,436 ) (1,080 ) (5,356 ) 495.9 Income before provision (benefit) for income taxes 44,941 13,732 31,209 227.3 Provision (benefit) for income taxes (485 ) (485 ) Net income $ 45,426 $ 13,732 $ 31,694 230.8 % As a percent of total revenue 23.1 % 11.0 % 38 Revenue Subscription revenue Subscription revenue increased by 83.4% or $68.7 million from $82.4 million for the year ended February 29, 2004 to $151.1 million for the same period ended February 28, 2005. The increase in subscription revenue sales was driven by broad market acceptance and the increasing use of our enterprise technologies in mission critical areas of computing by the enterprise, as well as increasing revenue through OEM and distributor relationships that we have developed over the past three years. Our sales force has also increased to better address the growing market opportunity. The increase was partially offset by a decrease in retail product sales. Sales of our retail product (which we discontinued by February 2005) to consumers through either value added resellers or distributors, decreased by $11.6 million. For the year ended February 28, 2005, retail revenues were not a significant component of our revenues. Training and services revenue Training and services revenue increased 7.1% or $3.0 million from $42.3 million for the year ended February 29, 2004 to $45.3 million for the same period ended February 28, 2005. The increase in training and services revenue was primarily due to an increase in the revenues earned from customer training and education of $5.9 million. We continue to view our customer training and education business as an indicator of demand for the use of our Enterprise Linux technologies by enterprise customers. The adoption of Linux as a primary computing platform increases the need to train system administrators and developers. This increase was offset by a decrease in consulting fees received from enterprise customers for deployment of Red Hat Enterprise technologies of approximately $0.6 million and a decrease in the services revenues earned from agreements with our OEM partners for adding functionality of $0.6 million. The remaining decrease was due to our reduced focus on, and consequently reduced personnel dedicated to, our embedded technology consulting. Cost of revenue Cost of subscription revenue Cost of subscription revenue increased by 39.5% or $3.8 million from $9.7 million for the year ended February 29, 2004 to $13.5 million for the same period ended February 28, 2005. The increase was the result of additions to our technical support staff at each of our three call center locations to meet the demands of our growing subscriber base due to the increased number of subscriptions to Enterprise Linux that we sold during fiscal 2005. As the number of subscriptions for Enterprise Linux continues to increase, our cost of subscription revenues will also increase, although we anticipate this will occur at a rate slower than that of subscription revenue growth. Cost of training and services revenue Cost of training and services revenue increased by 3.0% or $0.7 million from $24.3 million for the year ended February 29, 2004 to $25.0 million for the same period ended February 28, 2005. The cost of our customer training and education services increased $2.5 million, which is consistent with the increase in revenue of these services. This increase was partially offset by a $1.4 million decrease in our enterprise technologies professional consulting costs related to headcount reductions to our consulting staff during fiscal 2004 and 2005 as we have revised our consulting strategy to focus on strategic relationships with key customers with larger Linux deployments. In addition, the cost of consulting for embedded technology decreased $0.5 million due to a reduction in this workforce. Gross profit Gross profit increased 74.0% or $67.2 million from $90.8 million for the year ended February 29, 2004 to $158.0 million for the same period ended February 28, 2005. Gross margin was 72.8% and 80.4% of total 39 revenue for the years ended February 29, 2004 and February 28, 2005, respectively. This increase in gross profit and gross margin was primarily due to the increase in revenue and profitability related to our Enterprise Linux offerings. Operating expenses Sales and marketing Sales and marketing expense increased 53.8% or $22.0 million from $40.9 million for the year ended February 29, 2004 to $62.9 million for the same period ended February 28, 2005. This increase was primarily due to an $18.4 million increase in enterprise sales costs as we increased the size of each of our sales teams including, inside sales, direct outside sales and channel sales as well as a $3.9 million increase in our marketing costs. Sales and marketing expense was 32.8% and 32.0% of total revenues for the years ended February 29, 2004 and February 28, 2005, respectively. Research and development Research and development expense increased by 22.6% or $6.0 million from $26.5 million for the year ended ended February 29, 2004 to $32.5 million for the same period ended February 28, 2005. The increase in research and development expense resulted from an increase in engineering headcount and related compensation expense of approximately $3.0 million to support the development and integration of our Enterprise Linux operating platforms as well as our Desktop and Storage products. We acquired Sistina, Inc. in the fourth quarter of fiscal 2004 and added approximately $0.6 million per quarter in cost related to Sistina file storage development team. We also added resources to our Desktop team and the cost associated with this team increased by $1.7 million in fiscal 2005 compared to the prior year. Finally, as part of the Netscape Security Solutions acquisition from AOL, we added engineering costs of approximately $0.6 in the fourth quarter of fiscal 2005. Research and development expense was 21.2% and 16.5% of total revenues for years ended February 29, 2004 and February 28, 2005, respectively. General and administrative General and administrative expense increased 74.2% or $15.2 million from $20.5 million for the year ended February 29, 2004 to $35.6 million for the same period ended February 28, 2005. The largest portion of the increase relates to professional fees of $6.1 million incurred in connection with the restatement of certain of our previously filed financial statements in the summer of 2004 and related litigation, Sarbanes-Oxley Section 404 compliance and other consulting services related to our long-term compensation plans. Facility costs and depreciation increased by $2.7 million during the year primarily related to additional office space and additional system costs associated with increased staffing. Payroll costs increased by $1.7 million which is due to higher compensation and benefits associated with increased headcount. Other administrative costs such as bank fees, property and franchise taxes and travel costs comprise the remainder of the increase. General and administrative expense was 16.4% and 18.1% of total revenues for the years ended February 29, 2004 and February 28, 2005, respectively. Other income and expense, net Other income and expense net, consists of interest income earned on cash deposited in money market accounts and invested in short- and long-term fixed income instruments and gains and losses on foreign currency transactions and investments, net. Other income and expense, net increased by 105.9% or $12.6 million to $24.4 million for the year ended February 28, 2005 from $11.9 million for the same period ended February 29, 2004. The increase is primarily due to increased interest income associated with the increase in our cash and investment balances as a result of our convertible debenture offering in January 2004. Interest expense Interest expense consists of interest expense incurred on short term debt, capital leases and the convertible debentures. Interest expense increased $5.4 million to $6.4 million for the year ended February 28, 2005 from 40 $1.1 million for the same period ended February 29, 2004. The increase is principally related to interest expense associated with the convertible debentures, including amortization of debt issuance costs. Income taxes During the year ended February 28, 2005, we recorded a net tax benefit of approximately $0.5 million. We recorded $3.1 million of income tax expense and recognized a $3.6 million deferred tax benefit, primarily related to the reversal of the valuation allowance pertaining to certain foreign deferred tax assets as it was determined to be more likely than not that the deferred tax assets in these foreign jurisdictions would be realized. There was no provision or benefit recorded during the year ended February 29, 2004. Subsequent event On April 7, 2006, we entered into an Agreement and Plan of Merger (the Merger Agreement ), pursuant to which, subject to the satisfaction or waiver of the conditions in the Merger Agreement, we will acquire JBoss. The base consideration to be paid by us at the closing for all the outstanding equity of JBoss is approximately $350 million. We are also obligated to pay an additional approximately $70 million at specified times during the two years after the closing upon the achievement of certain performance milestones related to the JBoss products and services during calendar years 2006 and 2007. The consideration to be paid by us in connection with the merger will consist of approximately 40% in cash and approximately 60% in shares of Red Hat common stock. The number of shares to be issued by us will be calculated based on the average closing price for such shares over a 20-trading day period preceding the closing. The amount of consideration to be paid is subject to adjustment based on net working capital of JBoss on the closing date. The closing of the transaction is conditioned upon customary closing conditions, including the receipt of necessary regulatory approvals. The stockholders of JBoss approved the merger on April 7, 2006. ACQUISITIONS Acquisition of Netscape Security Solutions On December 7, 2004, we completed the purchase of the Netscape Security Solutions unit from Netscape Communications Corporation and America Online, Inc for a purchase price of $21.1 million in cash. The assets acquired include a directory server and certificate management system. In April 2006 an additional $2.5 million was paid under an earn-out provision, resulting in an increase in goodwill by the same amount. Sistina Software, Inc. In December 2003, we completed the acquisition of all of the outstanding common stock of Sistina Software, Inc. ( Sistina ) in exchange for the issuance of 1,979,874 shares of our common stock and the assumption of all of the outstanding Sistina stock options valued, in the aggregate, at $30.7 million, including net tangible and intangible assets of $2.0 million and $3.0 million, respectively. We engaged a third party to determine the fair market value of the net tangible and intangible assets acquired. The excess of purchase price over the fair values of the net assets acquired of $25.7 million has been recorded as goodwill. Liquidity and capital resources We have historically derived a significant portion of our liquidity and operating capital from the sale of equity securities, including private sales of preferred stock and the sale of common stock in our initial and secondary public offerings, the issuance of convertible debentures and borrowings under working capital lines of credit. At February 28, 2006, we had total cash and investments of $1.1 billion, which was comprised of $267.5 million in cash and cash equivalents, $537.3 million of short-term, fixed-income investments and $272.7 million of long-term, fixed-income investments. This compares to total cash and investments of $928.8 million at February 28, 2005. 41 We currently have sufficient liquidity with $267.5 million in cash and cash equivalents on hand that we presently do not intend to liquidate our short and long-term investments prior to their scheduled maturity dates. However, in the event that we did liquidate these investments prior to their scheduled maturities and there were no changes in market interest rates, we could be required to recognize a realized loss on those investments when we liquidate. At February 28, 2006, we have an unrealized loss of $9.8 million on our investments in debt securities compared to $10.7 million at February 28, 2005. Year ended February 28, 2006 At February 28, 2006, cash and cash equivalents totaled $267.5 million, an increase of $127.4 million as compared to February 28, 2005. The increase in cash and cash equivalents resulted primarily from $186.6 million in cash provided by operations and $44.1 million from the exercise of common stock options. Partially offsetting these sources of cash were uses of cash including repurchase of convertible debt of $26.3 million, purchases of long-term investments of $22.2 million, net purchases of investment securities of approximately $20.4 million, purchases of property and equipment of approximately $16.8 million and purchases of stock of $16.7 million. Cash provided by operations of $186.6 million in the year ended February 28, 2006, includes net income of $79.7 million, adjustments to exclude the impact of non-cash revenues and expenses, which totaled a $21.4 million net source of cash, and changes in working capital, which totaled $85.5 million net source of cash, primarily resulting from an increase in deferred revenue of $91.3 million and an increase in accrued expenses of $10.5 million. These working capital sources of cash were partially offset by an increase in accounts receivable and earnings in excess of billings of $10.8 million, an increase of $3.1 million in prepaid and other current assets and a decrease in accounts payable of $2.6 million. The increase in deferred revenue is due to growth in billings and the nature by which we generally obtain payments from customers for subscriptions to our technologies in advance of the subscription period. Cash used in investing activities of $62.3 million for the year ended February 28, 2006 was primarily comprised of purchases of long-term investments of $22.2 million, including $20 million for our investment in Open Invention Network LLC, net purchases of fixed income investment securities of approximately $20.4 million and purchases of property and equipment of approximately $16.8 million. Cash provided by financing activities of $5.7 million for the year ended February 28, 2006 was primarily comprised of $44.0 million in proceeds from employees exercise of common stock options, $3.4 million proceeds and withholding from issuance of common stock due to employees purchases under the Employee Stock Purchase Plan, and $1.0 million from proceeds of structured stock repurchases, partially offset by repurchase of convertible debt of $26.3 million and repurchase of common stock of $16.7 million. Year ended February 28, 2005 At February 28, 2005, cash and cash equivalents totaled $140.2 million, a decrease of $321.1 million as compared to February 29, 2004. The decrease in cash and cash equivalents during fiscal 2005 resulted primarily from cash provided by operations of $122.2 million and a total of $17.8 million in cash received from the exercise of common stock options and sale of common stock under our employee stock purchase plan, offset by the purchase of investments in debt securities, net of sales of debt securities, of $324.7 million, purchase of treasury stock of $100.0 million, acquisition of business of $21.1 million, purchases of property and equipment of $14.9 million and $1.0 million of cash used to pay down capital lease obligations. Cash provided by operations of $122.2 million in the year ended February 28, 2005, includes net income of $45.4 million, adjustments to exclude the impact of non-cash items, which totaled a $17.3 million net source of cash, and changes in working capital, which totaled a $59.5 million net source of cash, primarily resulting from an increase in deferred revenue of $61.2 million. The increase in deferred revenue is due to growth in billings to our customers for subscriptions to our technologies. 42 In the fiscal year ended February 29, 2004, cash provided by operations was $61.6 million. The significant improvement in our cash flow from operations in fiscal 2005 is a result of increased sales of subscriptions to RHEL, which resulted in the $61.2 million increase in deferred revenues, as well as from the $31.7 million increase in net income. In the fiscal year ended February 28, 2005, cash used in investing activities of $360.6 million was comprised of purchases of fixed-income investments of $854.5 million, , purchases of property and equipment mainly computer software, hardware and computer networking equipment totaling $14.9 million, and acquisition of businesses, net of cash acquired of $21.1 million the acquisition of the assets of the former Netscape Security Solutions unit from America Online, Inc. (See NOTE 3 to the Consolidated Financial Statements). Cash used in investing activities were partially offset by proceeds from sales and maturities of investment securities of $529.8 million. Cash used in financing activities of $83.4 million for the year ended February 28, 2005 was primarily comprised of $100.0 million in purchases of treasury shares pursuant to our previously announced share repurchase program, and $1.0 million in payments under capital lease obligations and debt financing costs, partially offset by a total of $17.8 million in proceeds received from the exercise of common stock options and sale of common stock under our Employee Stock Purchase Plan. Convertible debentures In January 2004, we issued $600 million in convertible senior debentures to the initial purchaser, a sophisticated, accredited investor with a pre-existing relationship with us, in a private placement pursuant to Section 4(2) of the Securities Act of 1933, as amended (the Securities Act ), and the debentures were resold by the initial purchaser to qualified institutional buyers under Rule 144A of the Securities Act. The debentures mature on January 15, 2024 and bear interest at a rate of 0.5% per annum, payable semiannually on January 15 and July 15 of each year. The debentures are senior unsecured obligations and rank equally in right of payment with all of our other existing and future unsecured and unsubordinated debt. The debentures are convertible into shares of our common stock under certain circumstances prior to maturity at a conversion rate of 39.0753 shares per $1,000 principal amount of debentures (which represents a conversion price of approximately $25.59 per share) subject to adjustment under certain conditions. We may redeem the debentures, in whole or in part, in cash at any time on or after January 15, 2009. Holders of the debentures may require us to redeem the debentures, in whole or in part, in cash on January 15 of 2009, 2014 and 2019. As of February 28, 2006, no debentures were redeemed. Accrued interest to the redemption date will be paid by us in any such redemption. Interest payments totaling $3.0 million were made during the year ended February 28, 2006. Accrued interest at February 28, 2006 was $0.4 million. See NOTE 11 to the Consolidated Financial Statements for further discussion. Capital requirements We have experienced a substantial increase in our operating expenses since our inception in connection with the growth of our operations, the development of our enterprise technologies, the expansion of our services operations and our acquisition activity. Our capital requirements during the year ending February 28, 2007 will depend on numerous factors including the amount of resources we devote to: Funding the continued development of our Enterprise Linux products; accelerating the development of our systems management services; improving and extending our services and the technologies used to deliver these services to our customers; pursuing other strategic acquisitions and alliances, including the anticipated completion of the JBoss acquisition, for which we have entered into an agreement and plan of merger described above under the heading Subsequent event ; and 43 making possible investments in businesses, products and technologies. We have and will continue to utilize cash and investments to fund, among other potential uses, purchases of our common stock, purchases of our convertible debentures, purchases of fixed assets and mergers and acquisitions. Given our historically strong operating cash flow and the $1.1 billion of cash and investments held at February 28, 2006, we do not presently anticipate the need to raise cash to fund our operations or our pending JBoss acquisition, either through the sale of additional equity or through the issuance of debt for the foreseeable future. However, we may take advantage of favorable capital market situations that may arise from time to time to raise additional capital. We believe that cash flow from operations will continue to improve; however, there can be no assurances that we will improve our cash flow from operations from the current rate or that such cash flows will be adequate to fund other investments or acquisitions that we may choose to make. We may choose to accelerate the expansion of our business from our current plans, which may require us to raise additional funds through the sale of equity or debt securities or through other financing means. There can be no assurances that any such financing would occur in amounts or on terms favorable to us, if at all. Off-balance sheet financing We have no off-balance sheet financing arrangements and do not utilize any structured debt , special purpose or similar unconsolidated entities for liquidity or financing purposes. Contractual Obligations The following table summarizes our principal contractual obligations at February 28, 2006 (in thousands): Total Less than 1 Year 1-3 Years 3-5 Years More than 5 Years Operating lease obligations $ 56,718 $ 6,176 $ 10,377 $ 10,397 $ 29,768 Purchase obligations 619 406 213 Convertible debentures, including related interest 621,300 2,850 5,700 5,700 607,050 Total $ 678,637 $ 9,432 $ 16,290 $ 16,097 $ 636,818 Accounting for Stock Options Historically, we recognized stock option expense pursuant to Accounting Principles Board Opinion No. 25, Accounting for Stock Issued to Employees ( APB 25 ), and have elected to disclose the impact of expensing stock options pursuant to Statement of Financial Accounting Standards No. 123, Share-Based Payment ( SFAS 123 ) in the notes to our Consolidated Financial Statements. Effective for fiscal 2007, we will adopt the provisions of Statement of Financial Accounting Standards No. 123R, Shared-Based Payments ( SFAS 123R ). Both SFAS 123 and SFAS 123R require us to make assumptions to determine the fair value of stock options, including the expected term of the options and the expected volatility of the underlying share price. Changes to such assumptions may have a significant impact on the value of our stock options, which could have a material effect on our consolidated financial statements. Additionally, we will be required to incorporate an estimate for forfeitures as we recognize the stock option expense over the requisite service period. Should our actual forfeitures differ from our estimates, our consolidated financial statements could be materially affected. We plan to adopt SFAS 123R on a prospective basis beginning on March 1, 2006. Accordingly the consolidated results of operations for future periods will not be comparable to our historical consolidated results 44 of operations. The adoption of SFAS 123R will have a material effect on our consolidated results of operations, increasing cost of revenue, sales and marketing expense, research and development expense and general and administration expense. We currently estimate the adoption of SFAS 123R will reduce diluted earnings per share by $0.10 in fiscal 2007; however the amount may change based on the number of options granted, the underlying share price at the time of grant, our estimate of forfeitures and our assumptions used to determine the options value, such as expected term and expected volatility. We will use the Black-Scholes-Merton option pricing model to determine the value of employee stock options and will use binomial or lattice models to determine certain assumptions used in the Black-Scholes-Merton pricing model, such as expected term. Expected volatility will be determined using a combination of historical volatility over a period equal to the expected term and implied volatility based on Red Hat options traded by the general public. For more information see discussion related to SFAS 123R at Recent Accounting Pronouncements in NOTE 2 to the Consolidated Financial Statements. RECENT ACCOUNTING PRONOUNCEMENTS See discussion in NOTE 2 to the Consolidated Financial Statements.
