ITEM 7 Management Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations EXECUTIVE OVERVIEW We are a global packaged foods company. We develop distinctive value-added food products and market them under unique brand names. We work continuously to improve our core products and to create new products that meet consumers evolving needs and preferences. In addition, we build the equity of our brands over time with strong consumer-directed marketing, innovative new products, and effective merchandising. We believe our brand-building strategy is the key to winning and sustaining leading share positions in markets around the globe. Our fundamental financial goal is to generate superior returns for our shareholders over the long term. We believe that increases in net sales, segment operating profit, earnings per share (EPS), free cash flow, cash return to shareholders, and return on average total capital are key drivers of financial performance for our business. Our long-term growth objectives are to consistently deliver: low single-digit annual growth in organic net sales; mid single-digit annual growth in total segment operating profit; high single-digit annual growth in diluted EPS excluding certain items affecting comparability; improvement in adjusted return on average total capital; free cash flow conversion averaging above 95 percent of adjusted net earnings after tax; and cash return to shareholders averaging above 90 percent of free cash flow, including an attractive dividend yield. We believe that this financial performance should result in long-term value creation for shareholders. Fiscal 2018 represented an important step in returning our business to sustainable topline growth. We made significant progress toward competing more effectively, with strong innovation, marketing, and in-store execution driving positive organic sales growth in each of our last three fiscal quarters. We also moved to reshape our portfolio for future growth with the acquisition of Blue Buffalo, a fast-growing, highly profitable pet food business. While our full-year profit results fell short of our initial plans, we finished fiscal 2018, delivering growth in net sales, total segment operating profit, adjusted operating profit margin, and adjusted diluted EPS in the fourth quarter. We maintained a disciplined focus on cash generation, resulting in significant growth in free cash flow this year. We generated substantial Holistic Margin Management (HMM) savings, and we reached our expected annualized savings goal of $700 million in fiscal 2018, compared to the fiscal 2015 base, from recent restructuring actions. However, these results were not enough to offset heightened input cost inflation, increases in other costs impacting cost of sales, and higher merchandising expense. Importantly, we made investments to accelerate our differential growth platforms and expanded our capabilities in e-commerce and Strategic Revenue Management (SRM), which are critical to future growth. Net sales growth rates for our North American Retail operating segment improved significantly compared to fiscal 2017 as good consumer marketing support, strong innovation, and improved in-store execution helped restore momentum. Our Convenience Stores & Foodservice operating segment net sales increased on innovation behind Focus 6 platforms and market-index pricing on flour. Our Europe & Australia segment net sales increased on favorable foreign currency exchange and successful innovation and distribution expansion for ice cream and snack bars. In our Asia & Latin America segment, improved in-market execution in Asia was overshadowed by a difficult general ledger implementation and a comparison to fiscal 2017 that included an extra month of results reported for Brazil. All of our segments operating profit results were impacted by higher than expected input cost inflation that was not fully offset by our HMM initiatives. Our consolidated net sales for fiscal 2018 rose 1 percent to $15.7 billion. On an organic basis, net sales essentially matched year-ago levels. Operating profit of $2.5 billion decreased 2 percent. Total segment operating 19 Table of Contents profit of $2.8 billion declined 5 percent and declined 6 percent on a constant-currency basis. Diluted EPS of $3.64 was up 31 percent compared to fiscal 2017. Adjusted diluted EPS, which excludes certain items affecting comparability of results, was up 1 percent to $3.11 per share and was flat on a constant-currency basis. Our return on average total capital was 12.7 percent, and adjusted return on average total capital decreased 190 basis points to 9.7 percent and decreased 200 basis points on a constant-currency basis (See the Non-GAAP Measures section below for a description of our use of measures not defined by generally accepted accounting principles (GAAP)). Net cash provided by operations totaled $2.8 billion in fiscal 2018 representing a conversion rate of 131 percent of net earnings, including earnings attributable to redeemable and noncontrolling interests. This cash generation supported capital investments totaling $623 million, and our resulting free cash flow was $2.2 billion at a conversion rate of 120 percent of adjusted net earnings, including earnings attributable to redeemable and noncontrolling interests. We also returned significant cash to shareholders through dividends totaling $1.1 billion and share repurchases totaling $602 million. A detailed review of our fiscal 2018 performance appears below in the section titled Fiscal 2018 Consolidated Results of Operations. As we turn to fiscal 2019, we remain focused on our Consumer First strategy and our global growth priorities to further improve our topline momentum. We plan to compete effectively across all our brands and geographies, increase investments to accelerate our differential growth platforms, and maximize the growth opportunities for Blue Buffalo as we integrate the business into the General Mills portfolio. We also plan to maintain our efficiency in this more inflationary cost environment, and we have initiatives underway to help protect our profitability. We expect the operating environment in fiscal 2019 to continue to be dynamic, requiring us to increase our agility while remaining focused on delivering on consumers expectations. Our fiscal 2019 targets reflect the investments we are making to enhance our capabilities and accelerate our growth, as well as the impact of adding Blue Buffalo to our portfolio. We believe that these initiatives will drive strong returns over the long term and further advance us toward our goal of consistently delivering profitable growth and top-tier returns for our shareholders. Our key full-year fiscal 2019 targets include: Organic net sales are expected to be in a range between flat and up 1 percent. Including the impact of the Blue Buffalo acquisition, net sales are expected to increase 9 to 10 percent. Constant-currency adjusted operating profit is expected to increase 6 to 9 percent from the base of $2.7 billion reported in fiscal 2018. Constant-currency adjusted diluted EPS are expected to range between flat and down 3 percent from the base of $3.11 earned in fiscal 2018. This estimate includes a 4-cent headwind related to the Blue Buffalo acquisition, driven by the impact of purchase accounting. We continue to pursue our Consumer First strategy and execute against our three key growth priorities: 1) competing effectively on all brands and across all geographies through strong innovation, effective consumer marketing, and excellent in-store execution; 2) accelerating growth on our four differential growth platforms including H agen-Dazs ice cream, snack bars, Old El Paso Mexican food, and our portfolio of natural and organic food brands; and 3) reshaping our portfolio through growth-enhancing transactions, including the recent acquisition of Blue Buffalo. We also intend to pursue divestitures of growth-dilutive businesses to further reshape our portfolio. By focusing on these priorities, we expect to generate consistent topline growth, which, when balanced with a disciplined focus on margin expansion, cash conversion, and cash returns, should create significant value for our shareholders. See the Non-GAAP Measures section below for a description of our use of measures not defined by GAAP. Certain terms used throughout this report are defined in a glossary in Item 8 of this report. 20 Table of Contents FISCAL 2018 CONSOLIDATED RESULTS OF OPERATIONS On April 24, 2018, we acquired Blue Buffalo, which became our Pet operating segment. We are reporting the Pet operating segment results on a one-month lag and accordingly, in fiscal 2018, our results do not include Pet segment operating results. In fiscal 2018, net sales increased 1 percent compared to last year. Operating profit margin of 15.9 percent was down 50 basis points from year-ago levels primarily driven by lower segment operating profit results partially offset by a decrease in restructuring, impairment, and other exit costs and favorable mark-to-market valuation of certain commodity positions. Adjusted operating profit margin decreased 90 basis points to 17.2 percent, primarily driven by higher input costs including currency-driven inflation on imported products in certain markets partially offset by lower selling, general and administrative expenses. Diluted earnings per share of $3.64 increased 31 percent compared to fiscal 2017, and adjusted diluted EPS, which excludes certain items affecting comparability, essentially matched year-ago levels on a constant-currency basis (see the Non-GAAP Measures section below for a description of our use of measures not defined by GAAP). A summary of our consolidated financial results for fiscal 2018 follows: Fiscal 2018 In millions, except per share Fiscal 2018 vs. Fiscal 2017 Percent of Net Sales Constant- Currency Growth (a) Net sales $ 15,740.4 1 % Operating profit 2,509.3 (2) % 15.9 % Net earnings attributable to General Mills 2,131.0 29 % Diluted EPS $ 3.64 31 % Organic net sales growth rate (a) Flat Total segment operating profit (a) 2,791.7 (5) % (6) % Adjusted operating profit margin (a) 17.2 % Diluted EPS, excluding certain items affecting comparability (a) $ 3.11 1 % Flat (a) See the Non-GAAP Measures section below for our use of measures not defined by GAAP. Consolidated net sales were as follows: Fiscal 2018 Fiscal 2018 vs. Fiscal 2017 Fiscal 2017 Net sales (in millions) $ 15,740.4 1 % $ 15,619.8 Contributions from volume growth (a) (1)pt Net price realization and mix 1 pt Foreign currency exchange 1 pt (a) Measured in tons based on the stated weight of our product shipments. The 1 percent increase in net sales in fiscal 2018 was primarily driven by favorable net price realization and mix and favorable foreign currency exchange, partially offset by lower contributions from volume growth. The Convenience Stores & Foodservice and Europe & Australia segments contributed to the increase in net sales in fiscal 2018 compared to the same period last year, while the North America Retail and Asia & Latin America segments decreased. Organic net sales in fiscal 2018 were flat compared to fiscal 2017, with contributions from organic volume growth in the Convenience Stores & Foodservice segment offset by organic volume declines in the Europe & Australia and Asia & Latin America segments. 21 Table of Contents Components of organic net sales growth are shown in the following table: Fiscal 2018 vs. Fiscal 2017 Contributions from organic volume growth (a) (1)pt Organic net price realization and mix 1 pt Organic net sales growth Flat Foreign currency exchange 1 pt Acquisitions and divestitures Flat Net sales growth 1 pt (a) Measured in tons based on the stated weight of our product shipments. Cost of sales increased $257 million in fiscal 2018 to $10,313 million. The increase included a $452 million increase attributable to product rate and mix and a $116 million decrease attributable to lower volume. We recorded a $32 million net decrease in cost of sales related to mark-to-market valuation of certain commodity positions and grain inventories as described in Note 7 to the Consolidated Financial Statements in Item 8 of this report, compared to a net decrease of $14 million in fiscal 2017. In fiscal 2018, we recorded $14 million of restructuring charges in cost of sales compared to $42 million in fiscal 2017. We also recorded $11 million of restructuring initiative project-related costs in cost of sales in fiscal 2018 compared to $44 million in fiscal 2017 (please see Note 4 to the Consolidated Financial Statements in Item 8 of this report). Gross margin declined 2 percent in fiscal 2018 versus fiscal 2017. Gross margin as a percent of net sales of 34 percent decreased 110 basis points compared to fiscal 2017. Selling, general and administrative (SG&A) expenses decreased $49 million to $2,753 million in fiscal 2018 compared to fiscal 2017. The decrease in SG&A expenses primarily reflects savings from cost management initiatives and an 8 percentage point decrease in media and advertising expense. In addition, we recorded $34 million of transaction and integration costs related to our acquisition of Blue Buffalo. SG&A expenses as a percent of net sales in fiscal 2018 decreased 40 basis points compared to fiscal 2017. Restructuring, impairment, and other exit costs totaled $166 million in fiscal 2018 compared to $183 million in fiscal 2017. During the fourth quarter of fiscal 2018, we executed our fiscal 2019 planning process and preliminary long-range planning process, which resulted in lower future sales and profitability projections in our plans for our businesses supporting the Yoki , Mountain High , and Immaculate Baking brand intangible assets. As a result, we recorded a $97 million impairment charge in the fourth quarter of fiscal 2018. In fiscal 2018, we approved global cost savings initiatives designed to reduce administrative costs and align resources behind high growth initiatives. We recorded $49 million of restructuring charges relating to this action in fiscal 2018. 22 Table of Contents Other charges associated with our restructuring initiatives recognized in fiscal 2018, 2017 and 2016 consisted of the following: As Reported Estimated In Millions Fiscal 2018 Fiscal 2017 Fiscal 2016 Prior to Fiscal 2016 Future Total Charge Cash Charge Cash Charge Cash Charge Cash Charge Cash Charge Cash Savings (b) Global reorganization $ (2.2 ) $ 40.3 $ 72.1 $ 20.0 $ - $ - $ - $ - $ - $ 8 $ 70 $ 68 Closure of Melbourne, Australia plant 15.7 9.2 21.9 1.6 - - - - 2 (4 ) 40 7 Restructuring of certain international product lines (0.1 ) 0.3 45.1 10.3 - - - - 1 (6 ) 46 5 Closure of Vineland, New Jersey plant 12.8 2.7 41.4 7.3 - - - - - 1 54 11 Project Compass 0.4 3.4 (0.4 ) 12.8 54.7 36.1 - - - 1 55 53 Project Century 7.8 (5.2 ) 44.0 49.4 182.6 34.1 181.8 12.0 - 1 416 91 Project Catalyst - 1.4 - 1.3 (7.5 ) 47.8 148.4 45.0 - - 141 96 Combination of certain operational facilities (1.0 ) (0.8 ) - 5.1 - 4.5 13.9 6.5 - 1 13 16 Other - - - - - 0.1 (0.6 ) 0.1 - - (1 ) - Total restructuring charges (a) 33.4 51.3 224.1 107.8 229.8 122.6 343.5 63.6 3 2 834 347 Project-related costs classified in cost of sales 11.3 10.9 43.9 46.9 57.5 54.5 13.2 9.7 4 8 130 130 Restructuring charges and project-related costs $ 44.7 $ 62.2 $ 268.0 $ 154.7 $ 287.3 $ 177.1 $ 356.7 $ 73.3 $ 7 $ 10 $ 964 $ 477 Cumulative annual savings $ 700 (a) Includes restructuring charges recorded in cost of sales of $14.0 million in fiscal 2018, $41.5 million in fiscal 2017, and $78.4 million in fiscal 2016. (b) Cumulative annual savings, versus fiscal 2015 base, in fiscal 2018. Includes savings from SG&A cost reduction projects. Does not include savings from global cost savings initiatives approved in the fourth quarter of fiscal 2018. Please refer to Note 4 to the Consolidated Financial Statements in Item 8 of this report for more information regarding our restructuring activities. Interest, net for fiscal 2018 totaled $374 million, $79 million higher than fiscal 2017, primarily driven by $36 million of charges related to the bridge term loan credit facility that provided backup financing for the Blue Buffalo acquisition, higher average debt balances, and $14 million of charges related to the repurchase of medium term notes, partially offset by changes in the mix of debt. Our consolidated effective tax rate for fiscal 2018 was 2.7 percent compared to 28.8 percent in fiscal 2017. The 26.1 percentage point decrease was primarily due to the provisional net benefit of $524 million recorded in fiscal 2018 related to the Tax Cuts and Jobs Act (TCJA). Our effective tax rate excluding certain items affecting comparability was 25.7 percent in fiscal 2018 compared to 29.2 percent in fiscal 2017 (see the Non-GAAP Measures section below for a description of our use of measures not defined by GAAP). The 3.5 percentage point decrease in the effective tax rate excluding certain items affecting comparability was primarily due to the lower U.S. federal blended statutory rate for fiscal 2018 as a result of the TCJA, partially offset by certain discrete events recorded during fiscal 2017. On December 22, 2017, the TCJA was signed into law. The TCJA significantly revised the U.S. corporate income tax system, including a reduction in the U.S. corporate income tax rate, implementation of a territorial system, and a one-time deemed repatriation tax on untaxed foreign earnings. The TCJA also resulted in a U.S. federal blended statutory rate of 29.4 percent for us in fiscal 2018. Generally, the impacts of the new legislation would be required to be recorded in the period of enactment, which for us was the third quarter of fiscal 2018. However, Accounting Standards Update 2018-05: Income Taxes (Topic 740) (ASU 2018-05) was issued with guidance allowing for the recognition of provisional amounts in the event that the accounting is not complete and 23 Table of Contents a reasonable estimate can be made. The guidance allows for a measurement period of up to one year from the enactment date to finalize the accounting related to the TCJA. Please see Note 14 to the Consolidated Financial Statements in Item 8 of this report for additional information. After-tax earnings from joint ventures of $85 million in fiscal 2018 was flat compared to fiscal 2017, as favorable foreign currency exchange for CPW was offset by unfavorable foreign currency exchange and lower net sales for HDJ and our $2 million after-tax share of a restructuring charge at CPW. On a constant-currency basis, after-tax earnings from joint ventures decreased 3 percent, including the CPW restructuring charge (see the Non-GAAP Measures section below for a description of our use of measures not defined by GAAP). The components of our joint ventures net sales growth are shown in the following table: Fiscal 2018 vs. Fiscal 2017 CPW HDJ Contributions from volume growth (a) Flat 2 pts Net price realization and mix Flat (1) pt Foreign currency exchange 5 pts (2) pts Net sales growth 5 pts (1) pt (a) Measured in tons based on the stated weight of our product shipments.

FISCAL 2017 CONSOLIDATED RESULTS OF OPERATIONS Fiscal 2017 includes an additional month of results from General Mills Brasil Alimentos Ltda (Yoki) (please refer to Note 1 to the Consolidated Financial Statements in Item 8 of this report). In fiscal 2017, operating results reflected challenging net sales performance. However, we continued to make progress against our cost savings and margin expansion initiatives. The net sales decline of 6 percent was driven by declining contributions from volume in the North America Retail and Europe & Australia segments including the impact of the divestiture of the North American Green Giant product lines in fiscal 2016, which were partially offset by favorable net price realization and mix. Operating profit margin of 16.4 percent was up 10 basis points from fiscal 2016 levels primarily driven by benefits from cost savings and spending optimization initiatives and favorable net price realization, partially offset by the gain from the Green Giant divestiture. Adjusted operating profit margin increased 130 basis points to 18.1 percent, driven by benefits from cost savings and spending optimization initiatives and favorable net price realization. Diluted EPS of $2.77 was flat to fiscal 2016 and adjusted diluted EPS, which excludes certain items affecting comparability, on a constant-currency basis increased 6 percent compared to fiscal 2016 (see the Non-GAAP Measures section below for a description of our use of measures not defined by GAAP). 24 Table of Contents A summary of our consolidated financial results for fiscal 2017 follows: Fiscal 2017 In millions, except per share Fiscal 2017 vs. Fiscal 2016 Percent of Net Sales Constant- Currency Growth (a) Net sales $ 15,619.8 (6) % Operating profit 2,566.4 (5) % 16.4 % Net earnings attributable to General Mills 1,657.5 (2) % Diluted earnings per share $ 2.77 Flat Organic net sales growth rate (a) (4) % Total segment operating profit (a) 2,952.6 (2) % (1) % Adjusted operating profit margin (a) 18.1 % Diluted earnings per share, excluding certain items affecting comparability (a) $ 3.08 5 % 6 % (a) See the Non-GAAP Measures section below for our use of measures not defined by GAAP.

The 6 percent decline in net sales primarily reflected lower organic net sales, unfavorable foreign currency exchange, and the Green Giant divestiture in fiscal 2016 (please refer to Note 3 to the Consolidated Financial Statements in Item 8 of this report). Organic net sales declined 4 percent driven by volume declines in the North America Retail and Europe & Australia segments which were partially offset by positive net price realization and mix. Components of organic net sales growth are shown in the following table: Fiscal 2017 vs. Fiscal 2016 Contributions from organic volume growth (a) (7)pts Organic net price realization and mix 3 pts Organic net sales growth (4)pts Foreign currency exchange (1)pt Acquisitions and divestitures (b) (1)pt Net sales growth (6)pts (a) Measured in tons based on the stated weight of our product shipments. (b) Primarily the Green Giant divestiture in fiscal 2016. Cost of sales decreased $678 million in fiscal 2017 to $10,056 million. The decrease included an $814 million decrease attributable to lower volume and a $137 million increase attributable to product rate and mix. We 25 Table of Contents recorded a $14 million net decrease in cost of sales related to mark-to-market valuation of certain commodity positions and grain inventories as described in Note 7 to the Consolidated Financial Statements in Item 8 of this report, compared to a net decrease of $63 million in fiscal 2016. In fiscal 2017, we recorded $42 million of restructuring charges in cost of sales compared to $78 million in fiscal 2016. We also recorded $44 million of restructuring initiative project-related costs in cost of sales in fiscal 2017 compared to $58 million in fiscal 2016 (please see Note 4 to the Consolidated Financial Statements in Item 8 of this report). Gross margin declined 5 percent in fiscal 2017 versus fiscal 2016. Gross margin as a percent of net sales of 36 percent increased 40 basis points compared to fiscal 2016. SG&A expenses decreased $318 million to $2,801 million in fiscal 2017 versus fiscal 2016 primarily due to a 17 percentage point decrease in media and advertising expense and cost savings initiatives. SG&A expenses as a percent of net sales decreased 90 basis points compared to fiscal 2016. During fiscal 2017, we recorded a $14 million divestiture loss from the sale of our Martel, Ohio manufacturing facility. Divestiture net gain totaled $148 million in fiscal 2016 primarily from the sale of Green Giant (please refer to Note 3 of the Consolidated Financial Statements in Item 8 of this report). Restructuring, impairment, and other exit costs totaled $183 million in fiscal 2017 compared to $151 million in fiscal 2016. Total charges associated with our restructuring initiatives recognized in fiscal 2017 and 2016 consisted of the following: As Reported In Millions Fiscal 2017 Fiscal 2016 Charge Cash Charge Cash Global reorganization $72.1 $20.0 $- $- Closure of Melbourne, Australia plant 21.9 1.6 - - Restructuring of certain international product lines 45.1 10.3 - - Closure of Vineland, New Jersey plant 41.4 7.3 - - Project Compass (0.4 ) 12.8 54.7 36.1 Total Century (a) 44.0 49.4 182.6 34.1 Project Catalyst - 1.3 (7.5 ) 47.8 Combination of certain operational facilities - 5.1 - 4.5 Other - - - 0.1 Total restructuring charges (a) 224.1 107.8 229.8 122.6 Project-related costs recorded in costs of sales 43.9 46.9 57.5 54.5 Restructuring charges and project-related costs $268.0 $154.7 $287.3 $177.1 (a) Includes $41.5 million of restructuring charges recorded in cost of sales in fiscal 2017 and $78.4 million in fiscal 2016. Please refer to Note 4 to the Consolidated Financial Statements in Item 8 of this report for more information regarding our restructuring activities. Interest, net for fiscal 2017 totaled $295 million, $9 million lower than fiscal 2016, primarily driven by lower rates and changes in the mix of debt, partially offset by higher average debt balances. 26 Table of Contents Our consolidated effective tax rate for fiscal 2017 was 28.8 percent compared to 31.4 percent in fiscal 2016. The 2.6 percentage point decrease was primarily due to non-deductible expenses related to the Green Giant divestiture in fiscal 2016. Our effective tax rate excluding certain items affecting comparability was 29.2 percent in fiscal 2017 compared to 29.8 percent in fiscal 2016 (see the Non-GAAP Measures section below for a description of our use of measures not defined by GAAP). After-tax earnings from joint ventures for fiscal 2017 decreased to $85 million compared to $88 million in fiscal 2016 primarily driven by unfavorable foreign currency exchange and an asset write-off for CPW, partially offset by contributions from volume growth and favorable foreign currency exchange for HDJ. On a constant-currency basis, after-tax earnings from joint ventures decreased 6 percent (see the Non-GAAP Measures section below for a description of our use of these measures not defined by GAAP).

RESULTS OF SEGMENT OPERATIONS On April 24, 2018, we acquired Blue Buffalo, which became our Pet operating segment. Our businesses are now organized into five operating segments: North America Retail; Convenience Stores & Foodservice; Europe & Australia; Asia & Latin America; and Pet. We are reporting the Pet operating segment results on a one-month lag and accordingly, in fiscal 2018, our results do not include Pet segment operating results. In the third quarter of fiscal 2017, we announced a new global organization structure to streamline our leadership, enhance global scale, and drive improved operational agility to maximize our growth capabilities. We restated our fiscal 2016 net sales by segment and segment operating profit amounts to reflect our new operating segments. These segment changes had no effect on previously reported consolidated net sales, operating profit, net earnings attributable to General Mills, or earnings per share. 27 Table of Contents The following tables provide the dollar amount and percentage of net sales and operating profit from each segment for fiscal 2018, 2017, and 2016: Fiscal Year 2018 2017 2016 In Millions Dollars Percent of Total Dollars Percent of Total Dollars Percent of Total Net Sales North America Retail $ 10,115.4 64 % $ 10,196.9 65% $ 10,936.6 66% Convenience Stores & Foodservice 1,930.2 12 1,870.0 12 1,923.8 12 Europe & Australia 1,984.6 13 1,824.5 12 1,998.0 12 Asia & Latin America 1,710.2 11 1,728.4 11 1,704.7 10 Total $ 15,740.4 100 % $ 15,619.8 100% $ 16,563.1 100% Segment Operating Profit North America Retail $ 2,217.4 80 % $ 2,303.6 78% $ 2,351.2 78% Convenience Stores & Foodservice 392.6 14 401.2 14 378.9 13 Europe & Australia 142.1 5 164.2 5 200.3 7 Asia & Latin America 39.6 1 83.6 3 69.1 2 Total $ 2,791.7 100 % $ 2,952.6 100% $ 2,999.5 100% Segment operating profit excludes unallocated corporate items, net gain/loss on divestitures, and restructuring, impairment, and other exit costs because these items affecting operating profit are centrally managed at the corporate level and are excluded from the measure of segment profitability reviewed by our executive management. NORTH AMERICA RETAIL SEGMENT Our North America Retail operating segment reflects business with a wide variety of grocery stores, mass merchandisers, membership stores, natural food chains, drug, dollar and discount chains, and e-commerce grocery providers.

Segment operating profit decreased 4 percent on a constant-currency basis in fiscal 2018 compared to fiscal 2017 (see the Non-GAAP Measures section below for our use of this measure not defined by GAAP). Segment operating profit of $2,304 million in fiscal 2017 decreased $48 million, or 2 percent, from fiscal 2016. The decrease was primarily driven by declining contributions from volume growth, currency-driven inflation on products imported into Canada, and the impact of the Green Giant divestiture, partially offset by benefits from cost savings initiatives, favorable net price realization, and a decrease in SG&A expenses, including a 16 percentage point decline in media and advertising expense. Segment operating profit decreased 2 percent on a constant-currency basis in fiscal 2017 compared to fiscal 2016 (see the Non-GAAP Measures section below for our use of this measure not defined by GAAP).

Revenues from export activities and franchise fees are reported in the region or country where the end customer or franchisee is located. Fiscal 2017 includes an additional month of results from Yoki (please refer to note 1 to the Consolidated Financial Statements in Item 8 of this report). Asia & Latin America net sales were as follows: Fiscal 2018 Fiscal 2018 vs. 2017 Percentage Change Fiscal 2017 Fiscal 2017 vs. 2016 Percentage Change Fiscal 2016 Net sales (in millions) (a) $ 1,710.2 (1)% $ 1,728.4 1% $ 1,704.7 Contributions from volume growth (b) (10)pts Flat Net price realization and mix 8 pts 1 pt Foreign currency exchange 1 pt Flat (a) Net sales includes approximately 3 percentage points of growth in fiscal 2017 and 3 percentage points of decline in fiscal 2018 due to an additional month of results from Yoki in fiscal 2017. (b) Measured in tons based on the stated weight of our product shipments. Asia & Latin America net sales decreased 1 percent in fiscal 2018 compared to fiscal 2017, which reflects lower net sales in Latin America markets due to the shift in reporting period in fiscal 2017 and challenges related to an enterprise reporting system implementation at Yoki, partially offset by higher net sales in Asia markets. Asia & Latin America net sales increased 1 percent in fiscal 2017 primarily driven by favorable net price realization in Latin America and China. Contributions from volume growth in fiscal 2017 were flat, including the impact of an additional month of results for Yoki in fiscal 2017. 32 Table of Contents The components of Asia & Latin America organic net sales growth are shown in the following table: Fiscal 2018 vs. 2017 Percentage Change Fiscal 2017 vs. 2016 Percentage Change Contributions from organic volume growth (a) (10)pts (2)pts Organic net price realization and mix 8 pts 5 pts Organic net sales growth (2)pts 3 pts Foreign currency exchange 1 pt Flat Acquisitions and divestitures (b) Flat (2)pts Net sales growth (1)pt 1 pt (a) Measured in tons based on the stated weight of our product shipments.

The 2 percent decrease in Asia & Latin America organic net sales in fiscal 2018 was driven by a 10 percent decrease in contributions from organic volume growth partially offset by an 8 percent increase in organic net price realization and mix. The 10 percent decrease in contributions from organic volume growth reflects lower contributions in Latin America markets due to the shift in reporting period in fiscal 2017 and challenges related to an enterprise reporting system implementation at Yoki, partially offset by higher contributions in Asia markets. The 3 percent increase in Asia & Latin America organic net sales in fiscal 2017 was primarily driven by a 5 percentage point increase from organic net price realization and mix resulting from pricing actions in the Latin America and China markets, partially offset by a 2 percentage point decline in contributions from organic volume which reflects the impact of macroeconomic challenges in Latin America and the restructuring of our snacks business in China. The 2 percentage point decline in contributions from organic volume included the impact of an additional month of results from Yoki in fiscal 2017. Segment operating profit decreased 53 percent to $40 million in fiscal 2018, compared to $84 million in fiscal 2017, primarily driven by lower net sales and higher input cost inflation, including currency driven inflation on imported products in certain markets. Segment operating profit decreased 56 percent on a constant-currency basis in fiscal 2018 compared to fiscal 2017 (see the Non-GAAP Measures section below for our use of this measure not defined by GAAP). Segment operating profit for fiscal 2017 increased 21 percent to $84 million from $69 million in fiscal 2016, primarily driven by growth in the H agen-Dazs business in China and the impact of an additional month of results from Yoki in fiscal 2017. Asia & Latin America segment operating profit increased 20 percent on a constant-currency basis in fiscal 2017 compared to fiscal 2016 (see the Non-GAAP Measures section below for our use of this measure not defined by GAAP). PET SEGMENT Our Pet operating segment includes pet food products sold primarily in the United States in specialty channels, including national pet superstore chains, regional pet store chains, neighborhood pet stores, and farm and feed stores; e-commerce retailers; military outlets; hardware stores; veterinary clinics and hospitals; and grocery and mass merchandisers. Our product categories include dog and cat food (dry foods, wet foods, and treats) made with whole meats, fruits and vegetables, and other high-quality natural ingredients. Our tailored pet product offerings address specific dietary, lifestyle, and life-stage needs and spans different product types, diet types, breed sizes for dogs, lifestages, flavors, product functions and textures, and cuts for wet foods. We are reporting the Pet operating segment results on a one-month lag and accordingly, in fiscal 2018, our results do not include Pet segment operating results. 33 Table of Contents UNALLOCATED CORPORATE ITEMS Unallocated corporate items include corporate overhead expenses, variances to planned domestic employee benefits and incentives, contributions to the General Mills Foundation, asset and liability remeasurement impact of hyperinflationary economies, restructuring initiative project-related costs, and other items that are not part of our measurement of segment operating performance. This includes gains and losses from the mark-to-market valuation of certain commodity positions until passed back to our operating segments in accordance with our policy as discussed in Note 7 to the Consolidated Financial Statements in Item 8 of this report. For fiscal 2018, unallocated corporate expense totaled $117 million compared to $190 million last year. In fiscal 2018, we recorded a $32 million net decrease in expense related to mark-to-market valuation of certain commodity positions and grain inventories compared to a $14 million net decrease in expense in the prior year. In addition, we recorded $14 million of restructuring charges, and $11 million of restructuring initiative project-related costs in cost of sales in fiscal 2018, compared to $42 million of restructuring charges and $44 million of restructuring initiative project-related costs in cost of sales in fiscal 2017. We also recorded $34 million of transaction and integration costs related to our acquisition of Blue Buffalo. For fiscal 2017, unallocated corporate expense totaled $190 million compared to $289 million in fiscal 2016. In fiscal 2017, we recorded a $14 million net decrease in expense related to mark-to-market valuation of certain commodity positions and grain inventories compared to a $63 million net decrease in expense in the prior year. In addition, we recorded $42 million of restructuring charges, and $44 million of restructuring initiative project-related costs in cost of sales in fiscal 2017, compared to $78 million of restructuring charges and $58 million of restructuring initiative project-related costs in cost of sales in fiscal 2016. The decrease in unallocated corporate expense also reflects lower incentive expense in fiscal 2017 compared to fiscal 2016. IMPACT OF INFLATION We experienced input cost inflation of 4 percent in fiscal 2018, 1 percent in fiscal 2017, and 2 percent in fiscal 2016, primarily on commodity inputs. We expect input cost inflation of approximately 5 percent in fiscal 2019. We attempt to minimize the effects of inflation through HMM, planning, and operating practices. Our risk management practices are discussed in Item 7A of this report. LIQUIDITY The primary source of our liquidity is cash flow from operations. Over the most recent three-year period, our operations have generated $8.0 billion in cash. A substantial portion of this operating cash flow has been returned to shareholders through share repurchases and dividends. We also use cash from operations to fund our capital expenditures and acquisitions. We typically use a combination of cash, notes payable, and long-term debt and occasionally issue shares of stock to finance significant acquisitions and major capital expansions. As of May 27, 2018, we had $383 million of cash and cash equivalents held in foreign jurisdictions. As a result of the TCJA, the historic undistributed earnings of our foreign subsidiaries will be taxed in the U.S. via the one-time repatriation tax in fiscal 2018. We are re-evaluating our indefinite reinvestment assertions in connection with the TCJA. As of the end of fiscal 2018, we have recorded a provisional estimate for local country withholding taxes related to certain entities from which we expect to begin repatriating undistributed earnings. As a result of the transition tax, we may repatriate our cash and cash equivalents held by our foreign subsidiaries without such funds being subject to further U.S. income tax liability. In fiscal 2018, we repatriated a portion of our foreign cash holdings to finance part of the Blue Buffalo acquisition, to reduce commercial paper, and for general corporate purposes. Please see Note 14 to the Consolidated Financial Statements in Part II, Item 8 of this report for further information on our indefinite reinvestment assertion. 34 Table of Contents Cash Flows from Operations Fiscal Year In Millions 2018 2017 2016 Net earnings, including earnings attributable to redeemable and noncontrolling interests $ 2,163.0 $ 1,701.1 $ 1,736.8 Depreciation and amortization 618.8 603.6 608.1 After-tax earnings from joint ventures (84.7) (85.0 ) (88.4) Distributions of earnings from joint ventures 113.2 75.6 75.1 Stock-based compensation 77.0 95.7 89.8 Deferred income taxes (504.3) 183.9 120.6 Pension and other postretirement benefit plan contributions (31.8) (45.4 ) (47.8) Pension and other postretirement benefit plan costs 4.6 35.7 118.1 Divestitures loss (gain) - 13.5 (148.2) Restructuring, impairment, and other exit costs 126.0 117.0 107.2 Changes in current assets and liabilities, excluding the effects of acquisitions and divestitures 542.1 (194.2 ) 298.5 Other, net (182.9) (86.3 ) (105.6) Net cash provided by operating activities $ 2,841.0 $ 2,415.2 $ 2,764.2 In fiscal 2018, cash provided by operations was $2.8 billion compared to $2.4 billion in fiscal 2017. The $426 million increase was primarily driven by the $462 million increase in net earnings and the $736 million change in current assets and liabilities, partially offset by a $688 million change in deferred income taxes. The change in deferred income taxes was primarily related to the $638 million provisional benefit from revaluing our net U.S. deferred tax liabilities to reflect the new U.S. corporate tax rate as a result of the TCJA. The $736 million change in current assets and liabilities was primarily due to changes in accounts payable of $476 million related to the extension of payment terms and timing of payments, and $264 million of changes in other current liabilities primarily driven by changes in income taxes payable, trade and advertising accruals, and incentive accruals. We strive to grow core working capital at or below the rate of growth in our net sales. For fiscal 2018, core working capital decreased 27 percent, compared to a net sales increase of 1 percent. In fiscal 2017, core working capital increased 9 percent, compared to a net sales decline of 6 percent, and in fiscal 2016, core working capital decreased 41 percent, compared to net sales decline of 6 percent. In fiscal 2017, our operations generated $2.4 billion of cash, compared to $2.8 billion in fiscal 2016. The $349 million decrease was primarily driven by a $493 million change in current assets and liabilities. The $493 million change in current assets and liabilities was primarily due to changes in other current liabilities driven by changes in income taxes payable, a decrease in incentive accruals, and changes in trade and advertising accruals due to reduced spending. The change in current assets and liabilities was also impacted by the timing of accounts payable. Additionally, we recorded a $14 million loss on a divestiture during fiscal 2017, compared to a $148 million net gain on divestitures during fiscal 2016, and classified the related cash flows as investing activities. 35 Table of Contents Cash Flows from Investing Activities Fiscal Year In Millions 2018 2017 2016 Purchases of land, buildings, and equipment $ (622.7) $ (684.4) $ (729.3) Acquisitions, net of cash acquired (8,035.8) - (84.0) Investments in affiliates, net (17.3) 3.3 63.9 Proceeds from disposal of land, buildings, and equipment 1.4 4.2 4.4 Proceeds from divestitures - 17.5 828.5 Exchangeable note - 13.0 21.1 Other, net (11.0) (0.5) (11.2) Net cash provided (used) by investing activities $ (8,685.4) $ (646.9) $ 93.4 In fiscal 2018, we used $8.7 billion of cash through investing activities compared to $647 million in fiscal 2017. In the fourth quarter of fiscal 2018, we acquired Blue Buffalo for an aggregate purchase price of $8.0 billion, including $103 million of consideration for net debt repaid. We invested $623 million in land, buildings, and equipment in fiscal 2018, $62 million less than last year. In fiscal 2017, we used $647 million of cash through investing activities compared to generating $93 million in fiscal 2016. We invested $684 million in land, buildings, and equipment in fiscal 2017, $45 million less than fiscal 2016. In fiscal 2016, we received proceeds of $828 million from the divestitures of certain businesses, primarily Green Giant. We expect capital expenditures to be approximately $745 million in fiscal 2019. These expenditures will fund initiatives that are expected to fuel international growth, support innovative products, and continue HMM initiatives throughout the supply chain.

Financing activities used $2.4 billion of cash in fiscal 2016. We had $5.2 billion more net debt issuances in fiscal 2018 than the prior year, primarily related to bonds issued to fund a portion of the Blue Buffalo acquisition. In fiscal 2017 we had $1.8 billion more net debt issuances than in fiscal 2016. For more information on our debt issuances and payments, please refer to Note 8 to the Consolidated Financial Statements in Item 8 of this report. During fiscal 2018, we received $970 million of net proceeds from common stock issued to fund a portion of the Blue Buffalo acquisition. In addition, we received $99 million in proceeds from common stock issued on exercised options compared to $113 million in fiscal 2017. During fiscal 2016, we received $172 million in proceeds from common stock issued on exercised options. 36 Table of Contents During fiscal 2018, we repurchased 11 million shares of our common stock for $602 million. During fiscal 2017, we repurchased 25 million shares of our common stock for $1,652 million. During fiscal 2016, we repurchased 11 million shares of our common stock for $607 million. Dividends paid in fiscal 2018 totaled $1,140 million, or $1.96 per share, a 2 percent per share increase from fiscal 2017. Dividends paid in fiscal 2017 totaled $1,135 million, or $1.92 per share, an 8 percent per share increase from fiscal 2016 dividends of $1.78 per share.

The Bridge Facility expired in the fourth quarter of fiscal 2018. 37 Table of Contents To ensure availability of funds, we maintain bank credit lines sufficient to cover our outstanding notes payable. Commercial paper is a continuing source of short-term financing. We have commercial paper programs available to us in the United States and Europe. We also have uncommitted and asset-backed credit lines that support our foreign operations. The credit facilities contain several covenants, including a requirement to maintain a fixed charge coverage ratio of at least 2.5 times. Certain of our long-term debt agreements, our credit facilities, and our noncontrolling interests contain restrictive covenants. As of May 27, 2018, we were in compliance with all of these covenants. We have $1,600 million of long-term debt maturing in the next 12 months that is classified as current, including $1,150 million of 5.65 percent notes due February 2019, 300.0 million euro-denominated floating-rate notes due March 20, 2019, and $100 million of 6.59 percent fixed rate medium term notes due for remarketing in October 2018. We believe that cash flows from operations, together with available short- and long-term debt financing, will be adequate to meet our liquidity and capital needs for at least the next 12 months. As of May 27, 2018, our total debt, including the impact of derivative instruments designated as hedges, was 73 percent in fixed-rate and 27 percent in floating-rate instruments, compared to 67 percent in fixed-rate and 33 percent in floating-rate instruments on May 28, 2017. We believe that our fixed charge coverage ratio and the ratio of operating cash flow to debt are important measures of our financial strength. Our fixed charge coverage ratio in fiscal 2018 was 5.89 compared to 7.26 in fiscal 2017. The measure decreased from fiscal 2017 as earnings before income taxes and after-tax earnings from joint ventures decreased by $136 million and interest expense increased by $83 million in fiscal 2018. Our operating cash flow to debt ratio decreased 7.5 percentage points to 18.0 percent in fiscal 2018, primarily driven by an increase in long-term debt. We have a 51 percent controlling interest in Yoplait SAS and a 50 percent interest in Yoplait Marques SNC and Libert Marques S rl. Sodiaal holds the remaining interests in each of these entities. We consolidate these entities into our consolidated financial statements. We record Sodiaal 50 percent interest in Yoplait Marques SNC and Libert Marques S rl as noncontrolling interests, and its 49 percent interest in Yoplait SAS as a redeemable interest on our Consolidated Balance Sheets. These euro- and Canadian dollar-denominated interests are reported in U.S. dollars on our Consolidated Balance Sheets. Sodiaal has the ability to put all or a portion of its redeemable interest to us at fair value once per year, up to three times before December 2024. As of May 27, 2018, the redemption value of the redeemable interest was $776 million which approximates its fair value. The third-party holder of the General Mills Cereals, LLC (GMC) Class A Interests receives quarterly preferred distributions from available net income based on the application of a floating preferred return rate to the holder capital account balance established in the most recent mark-to-market valuation (currently $252 million). For fiscal 2018, the floating preferred return rate on GMC Class A Interests was equal to the sum of three-month LIBOR plus 125 basis points. The preferred return rate is adjusted every three years through a negotiated agreement with the Class A Interest holder or through a remarketing auction. On June 1, 2018, subsequent to our fiscal year-end, the floating preferred return rate on the Class A Interests was reset to the sum of three-month LIBOR plus 142.5 basis points. We have an option to purchase the Class A Interests for consideration equal to the then current capital account value, plus any unpaid preferred return and the prescribed make-whole amount. If we purchase these interests, any change in the third-party holder capital account from its original value will be charged directly to retained earnings and will increase or decrease the net earnings used to calculate EPS in that period. OFF-BALANCE SHEET ARRANGEMENTS AND CONTRACTUAL OBLIGATIONS As of May 27, 2018, we have issued guarantees and comfort letters of $541 million for the debt and other obligations of consolidated subsidiaries, and guarantees and comfort letters of $167 million for the debt and other 38 Table of Contents obligations of non-consolidated affiliates, mainly CPW. In addition, off-balance sheet arrangements are generally limited to the future payments under non-cancelable operating leases, which totaled $559 million as of May 27, 2018. As of May 27, 2018, we had invested in five variable interest entities (VIEs). None of our VIEs are material to our results of operations, financial condition, or liquidity as of and for the fiscal year ended May 27, 2018. Our defined benefit plans in the United States are subject to the requirements of the Pension Protection Act (PPA). In the future, the PPA may require us to make additional contributions to our domestic plans. We do not expect to be required to make any contributions in fiscal 2019. The following table summarizes our future estimated cash payments under existing contractual obligations, including payments due by period: Payments Due by Fiscal Year In Millions Total 2019 2020 -21 2022 -23 2024 and Thereafter Long-term debt (a) $ 14,354.0 $ 1,599.8 $ 3,122.6 $ 2,315.5 $ 7,316.1 Accrued interest 107.7 107.7 - - - Operating leases (b) 559.3 137.4 208.0 122.7 91.2 Capital leases 0.5 0.3 0.2 - - Purchase obligations (c) 3,417.0 2,646.9 728.8 39.8 1.5 Total contractual obligations 18,438.5 4,492.1 4,059.6 2,478.0 7,408.8 Other long-term obligations (d) 1,199.0 - - - - Total long-term obligations $ 19,637.5 $ 4,492.1 $ 4,059.6 $ 2,478.0 $ 7,408.8 (a) Amounts represent the expected cash payments of our long-term debt and do not include $0.5 million for capital leases or $85.7 million for net unamortized debt issuance costs, premiums and discounts, and fair value adjustments. (b) Operating leases represents the minimum rental commitments under non-cancelable operating leases. (c) The majority of the purchase obligations represent commitments for raw material and packaging to be utilized in the normal course of business and for consumer marketing spending commitments that support our brands. For purposes of this table, arrangements are considered purchase obligations if a contract specifies all significant terms, including fixed or minimum quantities to be purchased, a pricing structure, and approximate timing of the transaction. Most arrangements are cancelable without a significant penalty and with short notice (usually 30 days). Any amounts reflected on the Consolidated Balance Sheets as accounts payable and accrued liabilities are excluded from the table above. (d) The fair value of our foreign exchange, equity, commodity, and grain derivative contracts with a payable position to the counterparty was $16 million as of May 27, 2018, based on fair market values as of that date. Future changes in market values will impact the amount of cash ultimately paid or received to settle those instruments in the future. Other long-term obligations mainly consist of liabilities for accrued compensation and benefits, including the underfunded status of certain of our defined benefit pension, other postretirement benefit, and postemployment benefit plans, and miscellaneous liabilities. We expect to pay $20 million of benefits from our unfunded postemployment benefit plans and $18 million of deferred compensation in fiscal 2019. We are unable to reliably estimate the amount of these payments beyond fiscal 2019. As of May 27, 2018, our total liability for uncertain tax positions and accrued interest and penalties was $223.6 million. SIGNIFICANT ACCOUNTING ESTIMATES For a complete description of our significant accounting policies, please see Note 2 to the Consolidated Financial Statements in Item 8 of this report. Our significant accounting estimates are those that have a meaningful impact 39 Table of Contents on the reporting of our financial condition and results of operations. These estimates include our accounting for promotional expenditures, valuation of long-lived assets, intangible assets, redeemable interest, stock-based compensation, income taxes, and defined benefit pension, other postretirement benefit, and postemployment benefit plans. Promotional Expenditures Our promotional activities are conducted through our customers and directly or indirectly with end consumers. These activities include: payments to customers to perform merchandising activities on our behalf, such as advertising or in-store displays; discounts to our list prices to lower retail shelf prices; payments to gain distribution of new products; coupons, contests, and other incentives; and media and advertising expenditures. The recognition of these costs requires estimation of customer participation and performance levels. These estimates are based on the forecasted customer sales, the timing and forecasted costs of promotional activities, and other factors. Differences between estimated expenses and actual costs are recognized as a change in management estimate in a subsequent period. Our accrued trade, coupon, and consumer marketing liabilities were $500 million as of May 27, 2018, and $483 million as of May 28, 2017. Because our total promotional expenditures (including amounts classified as a reduction of revenues) are significant, if our estimates are inaccurate we would have to make adjustments in subsequent periods that could have a significant effect on our results of operations. Valuation of Long-Lived Assets We estimate the useful lives of long-lived assets and make estimates concerning undiscounted cash flows to review for impairment whenever events or changes in circumstances indicate that the carrying amount of an asset (or asset group) may not be recoverable. Fair value is measured using discounted cash flows or independent appraisals, as appropriate. Intangible Assets Goodwill and other indefinite-lived intangible assets are not subject to amortization and are tested for impairment annually and whenever events or changes in circumstances indicate that impairment may have occurred. Our estimates of fair value for goodwill impairment testing are determined based on a discounted cash flow model. We use inputs from our long-range planning process to determine growth rates for sales and profits. We also make estimates of discount rates, perpetuity growth assumptions, market comparables, and other factors. We evaluate the useful lives of our other intangible assets, mainly brands, to determine if they are finite or indefinite-lived. Reaching a determination on useful life requires significant judgments and assumptions regarding the future effects of obsolescence, demand, competition, other economic factors (such as the stability of the industry, known technological advances, legislative action that results in an uncertain or changing regulatory environment, and expected changes in distribution channels), the level of required maintenance expenditures, and the expected lives of other related groups of assets. Intangible assets that are deemed to have definite lives are amortized on a straight-line basis, over their useful lives, generally ranging from 4 to 30 years. Our estimate of the fair value of our brand assets is based on a discounted cash flow model using inputs which include projected revenues from our long-range plan, assumed royalty rates that could be payable if we did not own the brands, and a discount rate. As of May 27, 2018, we had $20.9 billion of goodwill and indefinite-lived intangible assets. While we currently believe that the fair value of each intangible exceeds its carrying value and that those intangibles so classified will contribute indefinitely to our cash flows, materially different assumptions regarding future performance of our businesses or a different weighted-average cost of capital could result in material impairment losses and amortization expense. We performed our fiscal 2018 assessment of our intangible assets as of August 28, 2017. As of our annual assessment date, there was no impairment of any of our intangible assets as their related fair values were substantially in excess of the carrying values except for the Yoki and Progresso brand intangible 40 Table of Contents assets and the Latin America reporting unit. The excess fair value as of the fiscal 2018 test date of the Yoki and Progresso brand intangible assets and the Latin America reporting unit was as follows: In Millions Carrying Value of Intangible Asset Excess Fair Value as of Fiscal 2018 Test Date Yoki $ 138.2 1% Progresso 462.1 6% Latin America $ 272.0 21% In addition, while having significant coverage as of our fiscal 2018 assessment date, the Food Should Taste Good and Green Giant brand intangible assets and U.S. Yogurt reporting unit had risk of decreasing coverage. We will continue to monitor these businesses, as well as the businesses supporting the Yoki and Progresso brand intangible assets and the Latin America reporting unit for potential impairment. During the fourth quarter of fiscal 2018, we executed our fiscal 2019 planning process and preliminary long-range planning process, which resulted in lower future sales and profitability projections in our plans for our businesses supporting the Yoki , Mountain High , and Immaculate Baking brand intangible assets. As a result of this triggering event, we performed an interim impairment assessment of these assets as of May 27, 2018, and determined that the fair value of these brand assets no longer exceeded the carrying values of the respective assets. Significant assumptions used in that assessment included our updated long-range cash flow projections for the businesses, royalty rates, weighted average cost of capital rates, and tax rates. We recorded a $97 million impairment charge in the fourth quarter of fiscal 2018 related to these assets. Redeemable Interest In fiscal 2018, we adjusted the redemption value of Sodiaal redeemable interest in Yoplait SAS based on a discounted cash flow model. The significant assumptions used to estimate the redemption value include projected revenue growth and profitability from our long-range plan, capital spending, depreciation and taxes, foreign currency exchange rates, and a discount rate. As of May 27, 2018, the redemption value of the redeemable interest was $776 million. Stock-based Compensation The valuation of stock options is a significant accounting estimate that requires us to use judgments and assumptions that are likely to have a material impact on our financial statements. Annually, we make predictive assumptions regarding future stock price volatility, employee exercise behavior, dividend yield, and the forfeiture rate. For more information on these assumptions, please see Note 11 to the Consolidated Financial Statements in Item 8 of this report. The estimated fair values of stock options granted and the assumptions used for the Black-Scholes option-pricing model were as follows: Fiscal Year 2018 2017 2016 Estimated fair values of stock options granted $ 6.18 $ 8.80 $ 7.24 Assumptions: Risk-free interest rate 2.2 % 1.7 % 2.4 % Expected term 8.2 years 8.5 years 8.5 years Expected volatility 15.8 % 17.8 % 17.6 % Dividend yield 3.6 % 2.9 % 3.2 % 41 Table of Contents The risk-free interest rate for periods during the expected term of the options is based on the U.S. Treasury zero-coupon yield curve in effect at the time of grant. An increase in the expected term by 1 year, leaving all other assumptions constant, would increase the grant date fair value by 20 percent. If all other assumptions are held constant, a one percentage point increase in our fiscal 2018 volatility assumption would increase the grant date fair value of our fiscal 2018 option awards by 8 percent. To the extent that actual outcomes differ from our assumptions, we are not required to true up grant-date fair value-based expense to final intrinsic values. Historical data has a significant bearing on our forward-looking assumptions. Significant variances between actual and predicted experience could lead to prospective revisions in our assumptions, which could then significantly impact the year-over-year comparability of stock-based compensation expense. Any corporate income tax benefit realized upon exercise or vesting of an award in excess of that previously recognized in earnings (referred to as a windfall tax benefit) is presented in the Consolidated Statements of Cash Flows as an operating cash flow. The actual impact on future years cash flows will depend, in part, on the volume of employee stock option exercises during a particular year and the relationship between the exercise-date market value of the underlying stock and the original grant-date fair value previously determined for financial reporting purposes. Realized windfall tax benefits and shortfall tax deficiencies related to the exercise or vesting of stock-based awards are recognized in the Consolidated Statement of Earnings. Because employee stock option exercise behavior is not within our control, it is possible that significantly different reported results could occur if different assumptions or conditions were to prevail. Income Taxes We apply a more-likely-than-not threshold to the recognition and derecognition of uncertain tax positions. Accordingly, we recognize the amount of tax benefit that has a greater than 50 percent likelihood of being ultimately realized upon settlement. Future changes in judgment related to the expected ultimate resolution of uncertain tax positions will affect earnings in the quarter of such change. For more information on income taxes, please see Note 14 to the Consolidated Financial Statements in Item 8 of this report. Defined Benefit Pension, Other Postretirement Benefit, and Postemployment Benefit Plans We have defined benefit pension plans covering many employees in the United States, Canada, Switzerland, France, and the United Kingdom. We also sponsor plans that provide health care benefits to many of our retirees in the United States, Canada, and Brazil. Under certain circumstances, we also provide accruable benefits, primarily severance, to former and inactive employees in the United States, Canada, and Mexico. Please see Note 13 to the Consolidated Financial Statements in Item 8 of this report for a description of our defined benefit pension, other postretirement benefit, and postemployment benefit plans. We recognize benefits provided during retirement or following employment over the plan participants active working lives. Accordingly, we make various assumptions to predict and measure costs and obligations many years prior to the settlement of our obligations. Assumptions that require significant management judgment and have a material impact on the measurement of our net periodic benefit expense or income and accumulated benefit obligations include the long-term rates of return on plan assets, the interest rates used to discount the obligations for our benefit plans, and health care cost trend rates. Expected Rate of Return on Plan Assets Our expected rate of return on plan assets is determined by our asset allocation, our historical long-term investment performance, our estimate of future long-term returns by asset class (using input from our actuaries, investment services, and investment managers), and long-term inflation assumptions. We review this assumption annually for each plan; however, our annual investment performance for one particular year does not, by itself, significantly influence our evaluation. 42 Table of Contents Our historical investment returns (compound annual growth rates) for our United States defined benefit pension and other postretirement benefit plan assets were 8.5 percent, 8.5 percent, 6.5 percent, 9.1 percent, and 8.0 percent for the 1, 5, 10, 15, and 20 year periods ended May 27, 2018. On a weighted-average basis, the expected rate of return for all defined benefit plans was 7.88 percent for fiscal 2018, 8.17 percent for fiscal 2017, and 8.53 percent for fiscal 2016. For fiscal 2019, we lowered our weighted-average expected rate of return on plan assets for our principal defined benefit pension and other postretirement plans in the United States to 7.35 percent due to asset changes that decreased investment risk in the portfolio. Lowering the expected long-term rate of return on assets by 100 basis points would increase our net pension and postretirement expense by $67 million for fiscal 2019. A market-related valuation basis is used to reduce year-to-year expense volatility. The market-related valuation recognizes certain investment gains or losses over a five-year period from the year in which they occur. Investment gains or losses for this purpose are the difference between the expected return calculated using the market-related value of assets and the actual return based on the market-related value of assets. Our outside actuaries perform these calculations as part of our determination of annual expense or income. Discount Rates Beginning in fiscal 2017, we changed the method used to estimate the service and interest cost components of the net periodic benefit expense for our United States and most of our international defined benefit pension, other postretirement benefit, and postemployment benefit plans. We adopted a full yield curve approach to estimate service cost and interest cost by applying the specific spot rates along the yield curve used to determine the benefit obligation to the relevant projected cash flows. This method provides a more precise measurement of service and interest costs by correlating the timing of the plans liability cash flows to the corresponding rate on the yield curve. Previously, we estimated service cost and interest cost using a single weighted-average discount rate derived from the yield curve used to measure the benefit obligation at the beginning of the period. This change does not affect the measurement of our benefit obligations related to these plans. We have accounted for this change prospectively as a change in accounting estimate beginning in the first quarter of fiscal 2017. Our discount rate assumptions are determined annually as of May 31 for our defined benefit pension, other postretirement benefit, and postemployment benefit plan obligations. We work with our outside actuaries to determine the timing and amount of expected future cash outflows to plan participants and, using the Aa Above Median corporate bond yield, to develop a forward interest rate curve, including a margin to that index based on our credit risk. This forward interest rate curve is applied to our expected future cash outflows to determine our discount rate assumptions. Our weighted-average discount rates were as follows: Defined Benefit Pension Plans Other Postretirement Benefit Plans Postemployment Benefit Plans Effective rate for fiscal 2019 service costs 4.34% 4.27% 3.99% Effective rate for fiscal 2019 interest costs 3.92% 3.80% 3.37% Obligations as of May 31, 2018 4.20% 4.17% 3.60% Effective rate for fiscal 2018 service costs 4.37% 4.27% 3.54% Effective rate for fiscal 2018 interest costs 3.45% 3.24% 2.67% Obligations as of May 28, 2017 4.08% 3.92% 2.87% Effective rate for fiscal 2017 service costs 4.57% 4.42% 3.55% Effective rate for fiscal 2017 interest costs 3.44% 3.17% 2.67% Obligations as of May 29, 2016 4.19% 3.97% 2.94% 43 Table of Contents Lowering the discount rates by 100 basis points would increase our net defined benefit pension, other postretirement benefit, and postemployment benefit plan expense for fiscal 2019 by approximately $55 million. All obligation-related experience gains and losses are amortized using a straight-line method over the average remaining service period of active plan participants or over the average remaining lifetime of the remaining plan participants if the plan is viewed as all or almost all inactive participants. Health Care Cost Trend Rates We review our health care cost trend rates annually. Our review is based on data we collect about our health care claims experience and information provided by our actuaries. This information includes recent plan experience, plan design, overall industry experience and projections, and assumptions used by other similar organizations. Our initial health care cost trend rate is adjusted as necessary to remain consistent with this review, recent experiences, and short-term expectations. Our initial health care cost trend rate assumption is 7.0 percent for retirees age 65 and over and 6.7 percent for retirees under age 65 at the end of fiscal 2018. Rates are graded down annually until the ultimate trend rate of 4.5 percent is reached in 2029 for all retirees. The trend rates are applicable for calculations only if the retirees benefits increase as a result of health care inflation. The ultimate trend rate is adjusted annually, as necessary, to approximate the current economic view on the rate of long-term inflation plus an appropriate health care cost premium. Assumed trend rates for health care costs have an important effect on the amounts reported for the other postretirement benefit plans. A one percentage point change in the health care cost trend rate would have the following effects: In Millions One Percentage Point Increase One Percentage Point Decrease Effect on the aggregate of the service and interest cost components in fiscal 2019 $ 1.9 $ (1.8) Effect on the other post retirement accumulated benefit obligation as of May 27, 2018 47.8 (44.5) Any arising health care claims cost-related experience gain or loss is recognized in the calculation of expected future claims. Once recognized, experience gains and losses are amortized using a straight-line method over the average remaining service period of active plan participants or over the average remaining lifetime of the remaining plan participants if the plan is viewed as all or almost all inactive participants. Financial Statement Impact In fiscal 2018, we recorded net defined benefit pension, other postretirement benefit, and postemployment benefit plan expense of $23 million compared to $56 million of expense in fiscal 2017 and $163 million of expense in fiscal 2016. As of May 27, 2018, we had cumulative unrecognized actuarial net losses of $1.8 billion on our defined benefit pension plans and cumulative unrecognized actuarial net gains of $40 million on our postretirement and postemployment benefit plans, mainly as the result of liability increases from lower interest rates, partially offset by recent increases in the values of plan assets. These unrecognized actuarial net losses will result in increases in our future pension and postretirement benefit expenses because they currently exceed the corridors defined by GAAP. Actual future net defined benefit pension, other postretirement benefit, and postemployment benefit plan income or expense will depend on investment performance, changes in future discount rates, changes in health care cost trend rates, and other factors related to the populations participating in these plans. 44 Table of Contents RECENTLY ISSUED ACCOUNTING PRONOUNCEMENTS In August 2017, the Financial Accounting Standards Board (FASB) issued new hedge accounting requirements. The new standard amends the hedge accounting recognition and presentation requirements to better align an entity risk management activities and financial reporting. The new standard also simplifies the application of hedge accounting guidance. The requirements of the new standard are effective for annual reporting periods beginning after December 15, 2018, and interim periods within those annual periods, which for us is the first quarter of fiscal 2020. Early adoption is permitted. We are in the process of analyzing the impact of this standard on our results of operations and financial position. In March 2017, the FASB issued new accounting requirements related to the presentation of net periodic defined benefit pension expense, net periodic postretirement benefit expense, and net periodic postemployment benefit expense. The new standard requires the service cost component of net periodic benefit expense to be recorded in the same line items as other employee compensation costs within our Consolidated Statements of Earnings. Other components of net periodic benefit expense must be presented separately outside of operating profit in our Consolidated Statements of Earnings. In addition, the new standard requires that only the service cost component of net periodic benefit expense is eligible for capitalization. We recognized net periodic benefit expense of $23 million in fiscal 2018, $56 million in fiscal 2017, and $163 million in fiscal 2016 of which $123 million, $141 million, and $161 million, respectively, related to service cost. These amounts may not necessarily be indicative of future amounts that may be recognized subsequent to the adoption of this new standard. The new standard requires retrospective adoption of the presentation of net periodic benefit expense and prospective application of the capitalization of the service cost component. The requirements of the new standard are effective for annual reporting periods beginning after December 15, 2017, and interim periods within those annual periods, which for us is the first quarter of fiscal 2019. In February 2016, the FASB issued new accounting requirements for accounting, presentation and classification of leases. This will result in most leases being capitalized as a right of use asset with a related liability on our Consolidated Balance Sheets. The requirements of the new standard are effective for annual reporting periods beginning after December 15, 2018, and interim periods within those annual periods, which for us is the first quarter of fiscal 2020. We are in the process of implementing lease accounting software and analyzing the impact of this standard on our results of operations and financial position. Based on our assessment to date, we expect this guidance will have a material impact on our Consolidated Balance Sheets due to the amount of our lease commitments but we are unable to quantify the impact at this time. In May 2014, the FASB issued new accounting requirements for the recognition of revenue from contracts with customers. Under the new guidance, companies will apply a principles-based five step model to recognize revenue upon the transfer of promised goods or services to customers and in an amount that reflects the consideration for which the company expects to be entitled to in exchange for those goods and services. The requirements of the new standard and its subsequent amendments are effective for annual reporting periods beginning after December 15, 2017, and interim periods within those annual periods, which for us is the first quarter of fiscal 2019. We will adopt these requirements using the cumulative effect approach. We have evaluated and documented the impact of the guidance on our current accounting policies and practices and have not identified any material differences resulting from applying the new requirements to our revenue contracts. Additionally, we did not identify any significant changes to our business processes, systems, and controls to support recognition and disclosure requirements under the new guidance. This guidance will not have a material impact on our results of operations or financial position. NON-GAAP MEASURES We have included in this report measures of financial performance that are not defined by GAAP. We believe that these measures provide useful information to investors, and include these measures in other communications to investors. 45 Table of Contents For each of these non-GAAP financial measures, we are providing below a reconciliation of the differences between the non-GAAP measure and the most directly comparable GAAP measure, an explanation of why our management or the Board of Directors believes the non-GAAP measure provides useful information to investors and any additional purposes for which our management or Board of Directors uses the non-GAAP measure. These non-GAAP measures should be viewed in addition to, and not in lieu of, the comparable GAAP measure. Organic Net Sales Growth Rates This measure is used in reporting to our executive management and as a component of the Board of Directors measurement of our performance for incentive compensation purposes. We provide organic net sales growth rates for our consolidated net sales and segment net sales. We believe that organic net sales growth rates provide useful information to investors because they provide transparency to underlying performance in our net sales by excluding the effect that foreign currency exchange rate fluctuations, as well as acquisitions, divestitures, and a 53 rd week, when applicable, have on year-to-year comparability. A reconciliation of these measures to reported net sales growth rates, the relevant GAAP measures, are included in our Consolidated Results of Operations and Results of Segment Operations discussions in the MD&A above. Total Segment Operating Profit and Total Segment Operating Profit as a Percent of Net Sales Total segment operating profit is used in reporting to our executive management and as a component of the Board of Directors measurement of our performance for incentive compensation purposes. Management and the Board of Directors believe that this measure provides useful information to investors because it is the profitability measure we use to evaluate segment performance. Fiscal Year Percent of Net Sales 2018 2017 2016 2015 2014 Operating profit as reported $ 2,509.3 15.9 % $ 2,566.4 16.4 % $ 2,707.4 16.3 % $ 2,077.3 11.8 % $ 2,957.4 16.5 % Unallocated corporate items 116.8 0.7 % 190.1 1.2 % 288.9 1.8 % 413.8 2.3 % 258.4 1.5 % Divestitures loss (gain) - - % 13.5 0.1 % (148.2 ) (0.9) % - - % (65.5) (0.4)% Restructuring, impairment, and other exit costs 165.6 1.1 % 182.6 1.2 % 151.4 0.9 % 543.9 3.1 % 3.6 - % Total segment operating profit $ 2,791.7 17.7 % $ 2,952.6 18.9 % $ 2,999.5 18.1 % $ 3,035.0 17.2 % $ 3,153.9 17.6 % Diluted EPS Excluding Certain Items Affecting Comparability (Adjusted Diluted EPS) and Related Constant-currency Growth Rates This measure is used in reporting to our executive management and as a component of the Board of Directors measurement of our performance for incentive compensation purposes. We believe that this measure provides useful information to investors because it is the profitability measure we use to evaluate earnings performance on a comparable year-over-year basis.

Forward-Looking Financial Measures Our fiscal 2019 outlook for organic net sales growth and constant-currency total segment operating profit and adjusted diluted EPS are non-GAAP financial measures that exclude, or have otherwise been adjusted for, items impacting comparability, including the effect of foreign currency exchange rate fluctuations, restructuring charges and project-related costs, acquisition integration costs, and commodity mark-to-market effects. Our fiscal 2019 outlook for organic net sales growth also excludes the effect of acquisitions and divestitures. We are not able to reconcile these forward-looking non-GAAP financial measures to their most directly comparable forward-looking GAAP financial measures without unreasonable efforts because we are unable to predict with a reasonable degree of certainty the actual impact of changes in foreign currency exchange rates and commodity prices or the timing of acquisitions, divestitures and restructuring actions throughout fiscal 2019. The unavailable information could have a significant impact on our fiscal 2019 GAAP financial results. For fiscal 2019, we currently expect: foreign currency exchange rates (based on blend of forward and forecasted rates and hedge positions), acquisitions, and divestitures to increase net sales growth by high single digits; foreign currency exchange rates to have an immaterial impact on adjusted operating profit and adjusted diluted EPS growth; and restructuring charges and project-related costs related to actions previously announced to total approximately $13 million. 53 Table of Contents CAUTIONARY STATEMENT RELEVANT TO FORWARD-LOOKING INFORMATION FOR THE PURPOSE OF SAFE HARBOR PROVISIONS OF THE PRIVATE SECURITIES LITIGATION REFORM ACT OF 1995 This report contains or incorporates by reference forward-looking statements within the meaning of the Private Securities Litigation Reform Act of 1995 that are based on our current expectations and assumptions.
