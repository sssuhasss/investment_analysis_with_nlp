ITEM 7. MANAGEMENT'S DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS OF FINANCIAL CONDITION AND RESULTS OF OPERATIONS Financial Highlights - 2012 Compared to 2011 Our net income for 2012 was $1.0 billion , or $1.19 per diluted share. Total operating revenue increased $1.6 billion , or 4% , over 2011 , primarily due to higher passenger revenue due to yield improvement. Fuel expense, including our contract carriers under capacity purchase agreements, increased due to a 6% increase in our average price per gallon, despite a 2% decrease in consumption. Passenger revenue increased $1.6 billion due to a 5% year over year improvement in passenger mile yield on flat traffic, while capacity declined 2% . Passenger revenue per available seat mile ("PRASM") increased 7% over 2011 , reflecting higher revenue under corporate travel contracts and improvements in our products and services. Total operating expense increased $1.4 billion over 2011 , driven primarily by higher fuel expense and salaries and related costs. Our fuel expense increased $468 million (including our contract carriers under capacity purchase agreements) compared to 2011 due to a 6% increase in our average price per gallon, despite a 2% decrease in consumption. During 2012, we recorded losses of $66 million due to changes in the fair value of our fuel hedge portfolio. Excluding mark-to-market adjustments recorded in periods other than the settlement period ("MTM adjustments"), our average fuel price for the year was $3.26 per gallon, compared to $3.05 per gallon for 2011 . Our consolidated operating cost per available seat mile ("CASM") for 2012 increased 6% to $14.97 cent s, primarily reflecting increased fuel price. For 2012 , CASM-Ex was $8.92 cent s, or 5% higher than 2011 . The non-GAAP financial measures used in this section are defined in "Supplemental Information" below. Company Initiatives Strengthening the Balance Sheet We will continue to focus on cash flow generation with the goal of further strengthening our balance sheet. We finished 2012 with $5.2 billion in unrestricted liquidity (consisting of cash, cash equivalents, short-term investments and undrawn revolving credit facility capacity). During 2012, we generated $2.5 billion in cash from operating activities, and reduced debt by $1.1 billion and funded capital expenditures while maintaining a solid liquidity position. Structural Cost Initiatives We implemented a $1 billion structural cost initiatives program. These initiatives are designed to improve our cost efficiency while maintaining our operational performance and revenue generation and include: Domestic fleet restructuring to retire older, less efficient aircraft from our fleet; Maintenance redesign focusing on improving our processes and resource management; Distribution platforms to increase the use of cost effective and value-added distribution channels such as delta.com; Staffing efficiency to generate higher productivity levels through technology and improved staffing models; and Other costs to improve network efficiency and to reduce transportation expense. We anticipate realizing the benefits of the structural cost initiatives in 2013, with CASM-Ex growth moderating in the second half of 2013, and the benefits of the initiatives increasing through 2015. Domestic Fleet Restructuring Domestic fleet restructuring is a key part of our structural cost initiatives, and is focused on lowering unit costs while investing in our fleet to enhance the customer experience. We are restructuring our domestic fleet by reducing our 50-seat regional flying and replacing other older, less cost effective aircraft with newer, more efficient aircraft. Recent agreements with SkyWest Airlines, Inc., Pinnacle Airlines, Inc. and Bombardier Aerospace have produced a path for us to eliminate more than 200 50-seat aircraft. We are replacing these aircraft and older B-757-200 aircraft with more efficient and customer preferred CRJ-900, B-717-200 and B-737-900ER aircraft. 29 In 2012, we entered into an agreement with Bombardier Aerospace to purchase 40 CRJ-900 aircraft with 12 deliveries this year and 28 in 2014. Also in 2012, we finalized agreements with Southwest Airlines and The Boeing Company ("Boeing") to lease 88 B-717-200 aircraft. Delivery of the aircraft will begin later this year, with 16 aircraft scheduled to enter our fleet. We will receive 36 aircraft deliveries in each of 2014 and 2015. These B-717-200 aircraft are 110-seat aircraft and will feature new, fully upgraded interiors, with 12 First Class seats, 15 Economy Comfort seats and in-flight WiFi throughout the cabin. In 2011, we entered into an agreement with Boeing to purchase 100 new fuel efficient B-737-900ER aircraft. We will add these aircraft to our fleet between this year and 2018, primarily replacing older B-757-200 aircraft. We expect the B-737-900ER to offer an industry leading customer experience, including expanded carry-on baggage space and a spacious cabin. Additionally, we continue to increase our MD-90 fleet with previously owned aircraft that offer a lower total cost of ownership. As we restructure our fleet and assess our fleet plans, we will continue to evaluate older, retiring aircraft and related equipment for changes in depreciable life, impairment and lease termination costs. By 2015, we expect to reduce our 50-seat aircraft fleet to 125 aircraft. The associated retirement of aircraft will result in material lease termination and other charges over this period. We expect to benefit from reduced future maintenance cost and improved operational and fuel efficiency that we will experience over the life of the new aircraft. Oil Refinery Acquisition Jet fuel costs have continued to increase in recent years, making fuel expense our single largest expense. Because global demand for jet fuel and related products is increasing at the same time that jet fuel refining capacity is decreasing in the U.S. (particularly in the Northeast), the refining margin reflected in the prices we pay for jet fuel has increased. We purchased an oil refinery as part of our strategy to mitigate the increasing cost of the refining margin we are paying. Acquisition In June 2012, Monroe acquired the Trainer refinery and related assets located near Philadelphia, Pennsylvania from Phillips 66, which had shut down operations at the refinery. Monroe invested $180 million to acquire the refinery. Monroe received a $30 million grant from the Commonwealth of Pennsylvania. The acquisition includes pipelines and terminal assets that will allow the refinery to supply jet fuel to our airline operations throughout the Northeastern U.S., including our New York hubs at LaGuardia and JFK. Because the products and services of Monroe's refinery operations are discrete from our airline services, segment results are prepared for our airline segment and our refinery segment. Financial information on our segment reporting can be found in Note 2 of the Notes to the Consolidated Financial Statements. Refinery Operations and Strategic Agreements The facility is capable of refining 185,000 barrels of crude oil per day. BP is the primary supplier of crude oil used by the refinery under a three year agreement. We are also exploring other sources of crude oil supply, such as bringing supply to the refinery by rail from the Bakken oil field in North Dakota. We have increased the refinery's jet fuel capacity through capital improvements. The refinery's remaining production consists of gasoline, diesel and refined products ("non-jet fuel products"). Under a multi-year agreement, we are exchanging a significant portion of the non-jet fuel products with Phillips 66 for jet fuel to be used in our airline operations. Substantially all of the remaining production of non-jet fuel products is being sold to BP under a long-term buy/sell agreement effectively exchanging those non-jet fuel products for jet fuel. Our agreement with Phillips 66 requires us to deliver specified quantities of non-jet fuel products and they are required to deliver jet fuel to us. If we or Phillips 66 do not have the specified quantity and type of product available, the delivering party is required to procure any such shortage to fulfill its obligation under the agreement. Substantially all of the refinery's expected production of non-jet fuel products is included in these agreements. Refinery Start-Up During the December 2012 quarter, fuel production increased at the refinery. However, Superstorm Sandy negatively impacted the refinery start up, slowing production and lowering efficiency levels. The refinery recorded a $63 million net loss for the quarter. 30 New York Strategy Strengthening our position in New York City continues to be an important part of our network strategy. As discussed below, key components of this strategy are operating a domestic hub at LaGuardia and creating a state-of-the-art facility at JFK. In May 2012, we announced new and expanded service to 10 popular leisure destinations (in addition to the service expansion discussed below) in the Caribbean, Bermuda and Florida from LaGuardia and JFK. These flights began operating in the December quarter of 2012. LaGuardia. During December 2011, we closed transactions with US Airways where we received takeoff and landing rights (each a "slot pair") at LaGuardia in exchange for slot pairs at Reagan National. This exchange allows us to operate a new domestic hub at LaGuardia. We have increased capacity at LaGuardia by 42% since March 2012, adding 100 new flights and a total of 26 new destinations. The first phase of new flights began on March 25 and the second phase commenced on July 11. We currently operate about 260 daily flights between LaGuardia and 60 cities, more than any other airline. We are also investing more than $160 million in a renovation and expansion project at LaGuardia to enhance the customer experience. In December 2012, we opened the connector linking Terminals C and D and in September 2012 we opened a new SkyClub in Terminal C. Ongoing investments include expanded security lanes and a baggage handling system in both terminals as well as an expanded SkyClub in Terminal D. JFK. While our expanded LaGuardia schedule is focused on providing industry-leading domestic service, we are optimizing our international and trans-continental flight schedule at JFK to facilitate convenient connections for our passengers and improve coordination with our SkyTeam alliance partners. At JFK, we currently operate domestic flights primarily at Terminal 2 and international flights at Terminal 3 and, to a lesser extent, Terminal 4. Our five-year $1.2 billion renovation project at JFK, which began in 2010, is on schedule. The expansion and enhancement of Terminal 4, which includes the construction of nine new international gates, is expected to be open in the spring of 2013. Upon completion of the Terminal 4 expansion, we will relocate our operations from Terminal 3 to Terminal 4, proceed with the demolition of Terminal 3 and thereafter conduct coordinated flight operations from Terminals 2 and 4. Once our project is complete, we expect that passengers will benefit from an enhanced customer experience and improved operational performance, including reduced taxi times and better on-time performance. Alliances and Equity Investments We have made long-term investments in other airlines that give us the ability to increase our network scale and produce revenue improvements. We invested in GOL and Aeromexico because they operate in Latin America's two largest markets, Brazil and Mexico, respectively. Pending regulatory approval, we also agreed to buy 49% of Virgin Atlantic, currently held by Singapore Airlines, for $360 million. We also entered into a joint venture agreement with Virgin Atlantic with respect to operations on non-stop routes between the United Kingdom and North America. We and Virgin Atlantic will file an application with the U.S. Department of Transportation for U.S. antitrust immunity with respect to the joint venture. Pilot Agreement During the June 2012 quarter, we reached an agreement with the Air Line Pilots Association, International ( ALPA ) to modify the existing collective bargaining agreement covering Delta pilots. The agreement, which was ratified by the pilots in June 2012, provides career growth opportunities as well as pay and benefits improvements for our pilots including increases to base pay and changes to our profit sharing program. The agreement, which becomes amendable on December 31, 2015, will also provide Delta with productivity gains and support our domestic fleet restructuring. 31 Results of Operations - 2012 Compared to 2011 Operating Revenue Year Ended December 31, Increase (Decrease) % Increase (Decrease) (in millions) 2012 2011 Passenger: Mainline $ 25,237 $ 23,843 $ 1,394 6 % Regional carriers 6,570 6,414 156 2 % Total passenger revenue 31,807 30,257 1,550 5 % Cargo 990 1,027 (37 ) (4 )% Other 3,873 3,831 42 1 % Total operating revenue $ 36,670 $ 35,115 $ 1,555 4 % Increase (Decrease) vs. Year Ended December 31, 2011 (in millions) Year Ended December 31, 2012 Passenger Revenue RPMs (Traffic) ASMs (Capacity) Passenger Mile Yield PRASM Load Factor Domestic $ 14,050 7 % 1 % % 6 % 7 % 0.8 pts Atlantic 5,645 1 % (4 )% (7 )% 5 % 9 % 2.8 pts Pacific 3,645 10 % 6 % 3 % 3 % 7 % 2.6 pts Latin America 1,897 8 % 6 % 3 % 1 % 5 % 2.7 pts Total mainline 25,237 6 % 1 % (1 )% 5 % 7 % 1.7 pts Regional carriers 6,570 2 % (4 )% (5 )% 7 % 8 % 0.7 pts Total passenger revenue $ 31,807 5 % % (2 )% 5 % 7 % 1.7 pts Passenger Revenue. Passenger revenue increased $1.6 billion , or 5% , due to an improvement in the passenger mile yield of 5% , on a 2% decline in capacity. Passenger mile yield and unit revenue increased due to fare increases, higher revenue under corporate travel contracts and improvements in our products and services. International mainline passenger revenue increased $520 million. In early 2011, we faced industry overcapacity in the transatlantic market and in connection with our joint venture partners, AirFrance-KLM and Alitalia, we reduced capacity in underperforming markets during the second half of 2011 and in 2012. As a result, Atlantic PRASM was up 9% , driven by a 5% increase in yield on a 7% decrease in capacity. Pacific passenger revenue increased 10% on a 3% and 6% increase in capacity and traffic, respectively. These results reflect Pacific market improvement, as demand returned to levels seen prior to the March 2011 earthquake and tsunami in Japan. Latin America passenger revenue increased 8% on a 3% and 6% increase in capacity and traffic, respectively. 32 Operating Expense Year Ended December 31, Increase (Decrease) % Increase (Decrease) (in millions) 2012 2011 Aircraft fuel and related taxes $ 10,150 $ 9,730 $ 420 4 % Salaries and related costs 7,266 6,894 372 5 % Contract carrier arrangements 5,647 5,470 177 3 % Aircraft maintenance materials and outside repairs 1,955 1,765 190 11 % Passenger commissions and other selling expenses 1,590 1,682 (92 ) (5 )% Contracted services 1,566 1,642 (76 ) (5 )% Depreciation and amortization 1,565 1,523 42 3 % Landing fees and other rents 1,336 1,281 55 4 % Passenger service 732 721 11 2 % Profit sharing 372 264 108 41 % Aircraft rent 272 298 (26 ) (9 )% Restructuring and other items 452 242 210 NM (1) Other 1,592 1,628 (36 ) (2 )% Total operating expense $ 34,495 $ 33,140 $ 1,355 4 % (1) NM - not meaningful Fuel Expense. Including contract carriers under capacity purchase agreements, fuel expense increased $468 million because of a 6% increase in our average price per gallon, despite a 2% decrease in consumption. The table below presents fuel expense, gallons consumed and our average price per gallon, including the impact of fuel hedge losses of $66 million during the year ended December 31, 2012 : Year Ended December 31, Increase (Decrease) % Increase (Decrease) (in millions, except per gallon data) 2012 2011 Aircraft fuel and related taxes $ 10,150 $ 9,730 $ 420 Aircraft fuel and related taxes included within contract carrier arrangements 2,101 2,053 48 Total fuel expense $ 12,251 $ 11,783 $ 468 4 % Total fuel consumption (gallons) 3,769 3,856 (87 ) (2 )% Average price per gallon $ 3.25 $ 3.06 $ 0.19 6 % The table below shows the impact of hedging and the refinery on fuel expense and average price per gallon: Average Price Per Gallon Year Ended December 31, Increase (Decrease) Year Ended December 31, Increase (in millions, except per gallon data) 2012 2011 2012 2011 Fuel purchase cost $ 12,122 $ 12,203 $ (81 ) $ 3.23 $ 3.17 $ 0.06 Refinery impact 63 63 0.01 0.01 Fuel hedge losses (gains) 66 (420 ) 486 0.01 (0.11 ) 0.12 Total fuel expense $ 12,251 $ 11,783 $ 468 $ 3.25 $ 3.06 $ 0.19 MTM adjustments 27 (26 ) 53 0.01 (0.01 ) 0.02 Total fuel expense, adjusted $ 12,278 $ 11,757 $ 521 $ 3.26 $ 3.05 $ 0.21 33 Fuel Purchase Cost. Fuel purchase cost is based on the market price for jet fuel at airport locations. Refinery Impact. The refinery results include the impact on fuel expense of self-supply from the production of the refinery and from refined products exchanged with Phillips 66 and BP. As described in Note 2 of the Notes to the Consolidated Financial Statements, to the extent that we account for exchanges of refined products as non-monetary transactions, we include the results of those transactions within fuel expense. Fuel Hedge Losses (Gains) and MTM Adjustments. During the year ended December 31, 2012 , our fuel hedge losses of $66 million included $27 million of MTM adjustments. These MTM adjustments are based on market prices as of the end of the reporting period for contracts settling in future periods. Such market prices are not necessarily indicative of the actual future value of the underlying hedge in the contract settlement period. The losses for MTM adjustments are reflected in the table above to calculate an effective fuel cost for the period. We adjust fuel expense for these items to arrive at a more meaningful measure of fuel cost. Our average price per gallon, adjusted (a non-GAAP financial measure as defined in "Supplemental Information" below) was $3.26 for the year ended December 31, 2012 . Salaries and Related Costs . The increase in salaries and related costs is primarily due to employee pay increases, increases in pension expense and other benefits. During the June 2012 quarter, we reached an agreement with ALPA that increases pay and benefits for our pilots. Our pilots and substantially all other employees received base pay increases on July 1, 2012 and received additional increases on January 1, 2013. These increases are designed both to recognize changes to the profit sharing program described below and to accelerate the planned 2013 pay increase for non-pilot employees. Aircraft Maintenance Materials and Outside Repairs. Aircraft maintenance materials and outside repairs consists of costs associated with maintenance of aircraft used in our operations and maintenance sales to third parties by our MRO services business. The increase in maintenance costs is primarily due to the cyclical timing of maintenance events on our fleet. Additionally, maintenance cost increased as we accelerated certain maintenance events into 2012, resulting in a lower total cost for those activities, and completed maintenance initiatives to improve our operational reliability. Passenger Commissions and Other Selling Expenses. The decrease in passenger commissions and other selling expenses is primarily due to lower booking fees and international commission rates, partially offset by increases in sales. Contracted Services. Contracted services expense decreased year-over-year due primarily to the impact of severe winter storms on our operations in the March 2011 quarter. Profit Sharing. Our broad based employee profit sharing program provides that, for each year in which we have an annual pre-tax profit, as defined by the terms of the program, we will pay a specified portion of that profit to employees. In determining the amount of profit sharing, the terms of the program specify the exclusion of special items, such as MTM adjustments and restructuring and other items, from pre-tax profit. During the June 2012 quarter, our profit sharing program was modified so that we will pay 10% of profits on the first $2.5 billion of annual profits effective with the plan year beginning January 1, 2013 compared to paying 15% of annual profits for the 2012 plan year. Under the program, we will continue to pay 20% of annual profits above $2.5 billion. Restructuring and Other Items. Due to the nature of amounts recorded within restructuring and other items, a year-over-year comparison is not meaningful. For a discussion of charges recorded in restructuring and other items, see Note 16 of the Notes to the Consolidated Financial Statements. 34 Results of Operations - 2011 Compared to 2010 Operating Revenue Year Ended December 31, Increase % Increase (in millions) 2011 2010 Passenger: Mainline $ 23,843 $ 21,408 $ 2,435 11 % Regional carriers 6,414 5,850 564 10 % Total passenger revenue 30,257 27,258 2,999 11 % Cargo 1,027 850 177 21 % Other 3,831 3,647 184 5 % Total operating revenue $ 35,115 $ 31,755 $ 3,360 11 % Increase (Decrease) vs. Year Ended December 31, 2010 (in millions) Year Ended December 31, 2011 Passenger Revenue RPMs (Traffic) ASMs (Capacity) Passenger Mile Yield PRASM Load Factor Domestic $ 13,175 11 % % (1 )% 11 % 11 % 0.4 pts Atlantic 5,578 9 % (1 )% 2 % 10 % 7 % (2.1 ) pts Pacific 3,326 20 % 4 % 10 % 15 % 9 % (4.7 ) pts Latin America 1,764 13 % % % 13 % 13 % (0.6 ) pts Total mainline 23,843 11 % % 1 % 11 % 10 % (1.0 ) pts Regional carriers 6,414 9 % (2 )% (2 )% 12 % 12 % 0.1 pts Total passenger revenue $ 30,257 11 % % 1 % 11 % 10 % (0.9 ) pts Mainline Passenger Revenue. Mainline passenger revenue increased primarily due to an improvement in the passenger mile yield from fare increases implemented in response to higher fuel prices and from higher revenue under corporate travel contracts. Domestic . Domestic mainline passenger revenue increased 11% due to an 11% improvement in PRASM on a 1% decline in capacity. The improvement in PRASM reflects higher passenger mile yield driven by fare increases. International . International mainline passenger revenue increased 13% due to a 9% improvement in PRASM on a 4% capacity increase. Passenger mile yield increased 12%, reflecting increased business and leisure travel and increased fares, including fuel surcharges. Atlantic passenger revenue increased 9% due to a 7% increase in PRASM. We and the industry faced overcapacity in the Atlantic, particularly in early 2011, which prevented us from increasing ticket prices sufficiently to cover higher fuel prices. Pacific passenger revenue increased 20% on a 10% capacity increase. Pacific passenger mile yield increased 15% due to a stronger revenue environment, partially offset by the negative impact from the March 2011 earthquake and tsunami in Japan. Latin America passenger revenue increased 13% , benefiting from a 13% higher passenger mile yield driven by fare increases. Regional carriers . Passenger revenue from regional carriers increased 9% due to an 12% improvement in PRASM on a 2% decline in capacity. Passenger mile yield increased 12% , reflecting fare increases we implemented in response to increased fuel prices. Cargo . Cargo revenue increased 21% due to a 12% improvement in yield and an 8% increase in volume. Other. Other revenue increased $210 million due to higher maintenance sales to third parties by our MRO services business and $65 million due to an increase in the volume of ticket change fees. These increases were partially offset by $90 million in lower baggage fee revenue, resulting from an increase in bag fees waived for premium customers and customers under our co-brand credit card agreement with American Express. 35 Operating Expense Year Ended December 31, Increase (Decrease) % Increase (Decrease) (in millions) 2011 2010 Aircraft fuel and related taxes $ 9,730 $ 7,594 $ 2,136 28 % Salaries and related costs 6,894 6,751 143 2 % Contract carrier arrangements 5,470 4,305 1,165 27 % Aircraft maintenance materials and outside repairs 1,765 1,569 196 12 % Passenger commissions and other selling expenses 1,682 1,509 173 11 % Contracted services 1,642 1,549 93 6 % Depreciation and amortization 1,523 1,511 12 1 % Landing fees and other rents 1,281 1,281 % Passenger service 721 673 48 7 % Profit sharing 264 313 (49 ) (16 )% Aircraft rent 298 387 (89 ) (23 )% Restructuring and other items 242 450 (208 ) NM Other 1,628 1,646 (18 ) (1 )% Total operating expense $ 33,140 $ 29,538 $ 3,602 12 % On July 1, 2010, we sold Compass and Mesaba, our wholly-owned subsidiaries, to Trans States and Pinnacle, respectively. Upon the closing of these transactions, we entered into new or amended long-term capacity purchase agreements with Compass, Mesaba and Pinnacle. Prior to these sales, expenses related to Compass and Mesaba as our wholly-owned subsidiaries were reported in the applicable expense line items. Subsequent to these sales, expenses related to Compass and Mesaba are reported as contract carrier arrangements expense. Fuel Expense. Including contract carriers under capacity purchase agreements, fuel expense increased $2.9 billion on flat consumption. The table below presents fuel expense, gallons consumed and our average price per gallon, including the impact of fuel hedge activity: Year Ended December 31, Increase % Increase (in millions, except per gallon data) 2011 2010 Aircraft fuel and related taxes $ 9,730 $ 7,594 $ 2,136 Aircraft fuel and related taxes included within contract carrier arrangements 2,053 1,307 746 Total fuel expense $ 11,783 $ 8,901 $ 2,882 32 % Total fuel consumption (gallons) 3,856 3,823 33 1 % Average price per gallon $ 3.06 $ 2.33 $ 0.73 31 % Fuel expense increased primarily due to higher unhedged fuel prices, partially offset by an improvement in net fuel hedge results.

During 2011 , our net fuel hedge gains of $420 million included $26 million of MTM adjustments recorded in periods other than the settlement period. Salaries and Related Costs. Salaries and related costs increased due to a 3% average increase in headcount and employee pay increases, partially offset by the change in reporting described above due to the transactions involving Compass and Mesaba. Contract Carrier Arrangements . Contract carrier arrangements expense, excluding the impact of fuel expense (discussed above), increased primarily due to the change in reporting for the transactions involving Compass and Mesaba. Aircraft Maintenance Materials and Outside Repairs. Aircraft maintenance materials and outside repairs expense increased primarily due to costs associated with increased maintenance sales to third parties by our MRO services business, reflected in other revenue above. Passenger Commissions and Other Selling Expenses. Credit card and sales commissions increased in conjunction with the 11% increase in passenger revenue. Aircraft Rent. Aircraft rent decreased primarily due to the restructuring of certain existing leases and the change in reporting described above due to the transactions involving Compass and Mesaba. Restructuring and Other Items. Due to the nature of amounts recorded within restructuring and other items, a year-over-year comparison is not meaningful. For a discussion of charges recorded in restructuring and other items, see Note 16 to the Notes of the Consolidated Financial Statements. Non-Operating Results Year Ended December 31, Favorable (Unfavorable) (in millions) 2012 2011 2010 2012 vs. 2011 2011 vs. 2010 Interest expense, net $ (812 ) $ (901 ) $ (969 ) $ 89 $ 68 Amortization of debt discount, net (193 ) (193 ) (216 ) 23 Loss on extinguishment of debt (118 ) (68 ) (391 ) (50 ) 323 Miscellaneous, net (27 ) (44 ) (33 ) 17 (11 ) Total other expense, net $ (1,150 ) $ (1,206 ) $ (1,609 ) $ 56 $ 403 During the years ended December 31, 2012 , 2011 and 2010 , we recorded $118 million , $68 million and $391 million in losses from the early extinguishment of debt, which primarily related to the write-off of debt discounts. These debt discounts are a result of fair value adjustments recorded in 2008 to reduce the carrying value of our long-term debt due to purchase accounting and a $1.0 billion advance purchase of SkyMiles by American Express. As a result of these write-offs and scheduled amortization, our unamortized debt discount has decreased from $1.4 billion at the beginning of 2010 to $527 million at December 31, 2012 . 37 Income Taxes We consider all income sources, including other comprehensive income, in determining the amount of tax benefit allocated to continuing operations. During the three years ended December 31, 2012 , we did not record an income tax provision for U.S. federal income tax purposes since our deferred tax assets are fully reserved by a valuation allowance. The following table shows the components of our income tax (provision) benefit: Year Ended December 31, (in millions) 2012 2011 2010 International and state income tax benefit (provision) $ 1 $ (7 ) $ (15 ) Deferred tax (provision) benefit (17 ) 2 Alternative minimum tax refunds and other 90 Income tax (provision) benefit $ (16 ) $ 85 $ (15 ) During 2011, we recorded an income tax benefit of $85 million , primarily related to the recognition of alternative minimum tax refunds. At December 31, 2012 , we had $16.3 billion of U.S. federal pre-tax net operating loss carryforwards. Accordingly, we believe we will not pay any cash federal income taxes during the next several years. Our U.S. federal pre-tax net operating loss carryforwards do not begin to expire until 2022 . Financial Condition and Liquidity We expect to meet our cash needs for the next 12 months from cash flows from operations, cash and cash equivalents, short-term investments and financing arrangements. As of December 31, 2012 , we had $5.2 billion in unrestricted liquidity, consisting of $3.4 billion in cash and cash equivalents and short-term investments and $1.8 billion in undrawn revolving credit facilities. Sources of Liquidity Operating Cash Flow Cash flows from operating activities continue to provide our primary source of liquidity. We generated positive cash flows from operations of $2.5 billion in 2012 and $2.8 billion in each of 2011 and 2010 . See below under "Timing of SkyMiles Sales" for a discussion of the variances in 2012 and 2011 cash flows from operating activities compared to the preceding years. We expect to generate positive cash flows from operations in 2013. Our operating cash flows can be impacted by the following factors: Seasonality of Advance Ticket Sales . We sell tickets for air travel in advance of the customer's travel date, and receive cash payment at the time of sale. As a result, we record the cash received on advance sales as deferred revenue in Air Traffic Liability. The Air Traffic Liability increases during the spring as we have increased sales in advance of the summer peak travel season. Our cash balances are typically higher at the beginning of the summer and at a low point during the winter. Fuel and Fuel Hedge Margins . The cost of jet fuel is our most significant expense, representing approximately 36% of our total operating expenses. The market price for jet fuel is highly volatile and can vary significantly from period to period. This price volatility affects our cash flows from operations, impacting comparability from period to period. We have jet fuel inventories at various airport locations, which are used in our airline operations. Also, we acquired the Trainer oil refinery in 2012, which, as part of refinery operations, has refined oil product inventories. Jet fuel and refined oil product inventories are recorded as Fuel Inventory. Fuel Inventory increased during 2012 as a result of the start up of refinery operations in the September quarter and the transition of our fuel supply program. The increase in Fuel Inventory to achieve normal operating levels at our refinery was offset by a similar increase in accounts payable, and therefore, did not have a significant impact on operating cash flows during 2012. The remaining $180 million increase in Fuel Inventory was a result of the transition in Delta's fuel supply program. 38 As part of our fuel hedging program, we may be required to pay hedge margin to counterparties when our portfolio is in a loss position. Conversely, if our portfolio with counterparties is in a gain position, we may receive hedge margin. Our future cash flows are impacted depending upon the nature of our derivative contracts and the market price of the commodities underlying our derivative contracts Timing of SkyMiles Sales. In December 2011, we amended our American Express agreements and agreed to sell $675 million of unrestricted SkyMiles to American Express in each December from 2011 through 2014. Under the December 2011 amendment, American Express purchased $675 million of unrestricted SkyMiles in both 2012 and 2011. In 2011, this operating cash flow was largely offset by working capital changes. We anticipate American Express will make additional purchases of $675 million of unrestricted SkyMiles in both 2013 and 2014. In 2008, we entered into a multi-year extension of our American Express agreements and received $1.0 billion from American Express for an advance purchase of restricted SkyMiles. The 2008 agreement provided that our obligations with respect to the advance purchase would be satisfied as American Express uses the purchased miles over a specified future period ( SkyMiles Usage Period ). During the SkyMiles Usage Period, which commenced in December 2011, American Express draws down SkyMiles valued at $333 million annually over three years beginning 2012 instead of paying cash to Delta for SkyMiles used. This draw down of $333 million in SkyMiles reduced cash flows from operations in 2012 compared to 2011 and 2010. Pension Contributions. We sponsor defined benefit pension plans for eligible employees and retirees. These plans are closed to new entrants and are frozen for future benefit accruals. Our funding obligations for these plans are governed by the Employee Retirement Income Security Act, as modified by the The Pension Protection Act of 2006. We contributed $697 million and $598 million to our defined benefit pension plans during 2012 and 2011, respectively. We estimate the funding requirements under these plans will total approximately $675 million in 2013. Undrawn Lines of Credit Delta has available $1.8 billion in undrawn lines of credit. As described in Note 8 of the Notes to the Consolidated Financial Statements, we have an undrawn $1.2 billion first-lien revolving credit facility, as part of our 2011 Credit Facilities. The revolving credit facility carries a variable interest rate and expires in April 2016. We also have an undrawn $450 million revolving credit facility included in the 2012 Pacific Facilities, as described in Note 8 of the Notes to the Consolidated Financial Statements. The 2012 Pacific Facilities are secured by our Pacific routes and slots, as described in Note 6 of the Notes to the Consolidated Financial Statements. This revolving credit facility carries a variable interest rate and expires in October 2017. In addition, we have an undrawn bank revolving credit facility of $150 million. The credit facilities mentioned above have covenants, such as collateral coverage ratios. If we are not in compliance with these covenants, we must repay amounts borrowed under the credit facilities and may not be able to draw on the revolving credit facilities. Our ability to obtain additional financing, if needed, on acceptable terms could be adversely affected by the fact that a significant portion of our assets are subject to liens. Investing and Financing Capital Expenditures We incurred capital expenditures of $2.0 billion in 2012 and $1.3 billion in each of 2011 and 2010. Our capital expenditures were primarily for the purchase of aircraft and aircraft modifications that upgraded aircraft interiors and are enhancing our product offering. We have committed to future aircraft purchases that will require significant capital investment, and have obtained long-term financing commitments for a substantial portion of the purchase price of these aircraft. We expect that we will invest more than $2 billion in 2013 primarily for aircraft, aircraft modifications and the purchase of a $360 million equity investment in Virgin Atlantic. The 2013 investments will be funded through cash from operations and new financings. 39 Financings At December 31, 2012 , total debt and capital leases, including current maturities, was $12.7 billion , a $1.1 billion reduction from December 31, 2011 and a $2.5 billion reduction from December 31, 2010 . We have focused on reducing our total debt over the past three years as part of our strategy to strengthen our balance sheet. In addition, we have refinanced previous financing transactions, which we expect to reduce our total future interest expense. In 2012, we received $480 million in proceeds secured by aircraft previously financed by debt. In 2012, we also refinanced $1.7 billion in debt and undrawn revolving credit facilities secured by our Pacific routes and slots, which resulted in a lower interest rate. We expect the Pacific routes and slots refinancing transaction will generate more than $30 million in annual interest expense savings. Contractual Obligations The following table summarizes our contractual obligations at December 31, 2012 that we expect will be paid in cash. The table does not include amounts that are contingent on events or other factors that are uncertain or unknown at this time, including legal contingencies, uncertain tax positions and amounts payable under collective bargaining arrangements, among others. In addition, the table does not include expected significant cash payments which are generally ordinary course of business obligations that do not include contractual commitments. The amounts presented are based on various estimates, including estimates regarding the timing of payments, prevailing interest rates, volumes purchased, the occurrence of certain events and other factors. Accordingly, the actual results may vary materially from the amounts presented in the table. During 2012, our contractual obligations were impacted by our agreement with Bombardier to purchase 40 CRJ-900 aircraft with deliveries beginning in 2013 and continuing through 2014 and with our agreement with Pinnacle Airlines, Inc. to purchase 16 CRJ-900 aircraft with deliveries in 2013. Our estimated payments to purchase these aircraft are included in the obligations below. In addition, we entered into agreements with Southwest Airlines and The Boeing Company to lease 88 B-717-200 aircraft with deliveries beginning in 2013 and continuing through 2015. Contractual Obligations by Year (1) (in millions) 2013 2014 2015 2016 2017 Thereafter Total Long-term debt (see Note 8) Principal amount $ 1,267 $ 1,420 $ 1,062 $ 1,427 $ 2,144 $ 4,694 $ 12,014 Interest payments 600 540 460 390 300 660 2,950 Contract carrier obligations (see Note 10) 2,210 2,200 2,130 1,850 1,690 3,880 13,960 Operating lease payments (see Note 9) 1,507 1,433 1,332 1,159 1,000 7,415 13,846 Employee benefit obligations (see Note 11) 820 840 830 800 800 9,930 14,020 Aircraft purchase commitments (see Note 10) 1,000 1,525 815 810 760 3,240 8,150 Capital lease obligations (see Note 9) 209 173 158 164 97 113 914 Other obligations (2) 1,180 330 350 300 170 1,000 3,330 Total $ 8,793 $ 8,461 $ 7,137 $ 6,900 $ 6,961 $ 30,932 $ 69,184 (1) For additional information, see the Notes to the Consolidated Financial Statements referenced in the table above. (2) Includes $360 million in 2013 related to our agreement to buy, pending regulatory approval, 49% of Virgin Atlantic, currently held by Singapore Airlines. Long-Term Debt, Principal Amount. Represents scheduled principal payments on long-term debt. The table excludes amounts received from American Express for its advance purchase of restricted SkyMiles because this obligation will be satisfied by American Express' use of SkyMiles over a specified period rather than by cash payments from us. For additional information about our agreements with American Express, see Note 7 of the Notes to the Consolidated Financial Statements. Long-Term Debt, Interest Payments. Represents estimated interest payments under our long-term debt based on the interest rates specified in the applicable debt agreements. Interest payments on variable interest rate debt were calculated using LIBOR at December 31, 2012 . Contract Carrier Obligations. Represents our estimated minimum fixed obligations under capacity purchase agreements with regional carriers. The reported amounts are based on (1) the required minimum levels of flying by our contract carriers under the applicable agreements and (2) assumptions regarding the costs associated with such minimum levels of flying. 40 Employee Benefit Obligations. Represents primarily (1) our estimated minimum required funding for our qualified defined benefit pension plans based on actuarially determined estimates and (2) projected future benefit payments from our unfunded postretirement and postemployment plans. For additional information about our employee benefit obligations, see Critical Accounting Policies and Estimates . Aircraft Purchase Commitments. Represents primarily our commitments to purchase 100 B-737-900ER aircraft, 18 B-787-8 aircraft, 56 CRJ-900 aircraft and four previously owned MD-90 aircraft. Our purchase commitment for 18 B-787-8 aircraft provides for certain aircraft substitution rights. Other Obligations. Represents estimated purchase obligations under which we are required to make minimum payments for goods and services, including but not limited to insurance, marketing, maintenance, technology, sponsorships and other third party services and products. Additionally, other obligations includes estimates of lease payments that will be made under agreements entered into in 2012 with Southwest Airlines and The Boeing Company to lease 88 B-717-200 aircraft with deliveries beginning in 2013 and continuing through 2015. Critical Accounting Policies and Estimates Our critical accounting policies and estimates are those that require significant judgments and estimates. Accordingly, the actual results may differ materially from these estimates. For a discussion of these and other accounting policies, see Note 1 of the Notes to the Consolidated Financial Statements. Frequent Flyer Program Our frequent flyer program (the SkyMiles Program ) offers incentives to travel on Delta. This program allows customers to earn mileage credits by flying on Delta, regional air carriers with which we have contract carrier agreements and airlines that participate in the SkyMiles Program, as well as through participating companies such as credit card companies, hotels and car rental agencies. We also sell mileage credits to non-airline businesses, customers and other airlines. The SkyMiles Program includes two types of transactions that are considered revenue arrangements with multiple deliverables. As discussed below, these are (1) passenger ticket sales earning mileage credits and (2) the sale of mileage credits to participating companies with which we have marketing agreements. Mileage credits are a separate unit of accounting as they can be redeemed by customers in future periods for air travel on Delta and participating airlines, membership in our Sky Club and other program awards. Passenger Ticket Sales Earning Mileage Credits. Passenger ticket sales earning mileage credits under our SkyMiles Program provide customers with two deliverables: (1) mileage credits earned and (2) air transportation. We value each deliverable on a standalone basis. Our estimate of the standalone selling price of a mileage credit is based on an analysis of our sales of mileage credits to other airlines and customers and is re-evaluated at least annually. We use established ticket prices to determine the standalone selling price of air transportation. We allocate the total amount collected from passenger ticket sales between the deliverables based on their relative selling prices. We defer revenue for the mileage credits related to passenger ticket sales and recognize it as passenger revenue when miles are redeemed and services are provided. We record the air transportation portion of the passenger ticket sales in air traffic liability and recognize these amounts in passenger revenue when we provide transportation or when the ticket expires unused. A hypothetical 10% increase in our estimate of the standalone selling price of a mileage credit would decrease passenger revenue by approximately $50 million, as a result of an increase in the amount of revenue deferred from the mileage component of passenger ticket sales. Sale of Mileage Credits. Customers may earn mileage credits through participating companies such as credit card companies, hotels and car rental agencies with which we have marketing agreements to sell mileage credits. Our contracts to sell mileage credits under these marketing agreements have two deliverables: (1) the mileage credits redeemable for future travel and (2) the marketing component. 41 Our most significant contract to sell mileage credits relates to our co-brand credit card relationship with American Express. We defer revenue related to the mileage credits sold to American Express based on prices at which we sell mileage credits to other airlines, and re-evaluate our deferral rate at least annually. We allocate an amount to the marketing component in an amount equal to the excess of the amount received over the mileage component. Under this approach (the "residual method ), the deferred revenue from the mileage component is recognized as passenger revenue when miles are redeemed and services are provided, while the portion of the revenue related to the marketing component is recognized as those marketing services are provided. We will continue to use the residual method until our contract with American Express is materially modified. If we materially modify this agreement, we will then be required to allocate the consideration received to the marketing and the mileage components based upon their relative selling prices ( relative selling price method ). A material modification of this contract and the resultant change from the residual method to the relative selling price method could impact our deferral rate or cause an adjustment to our deferred revenue balance, which could materially impact our future financial results. Breakage. For mileage credits which we estimate are not likely to be redeemed ( breakage ), we recognize the associated value proportionally during the period in which the remaining mileage credits are expected to be redeemed. Management uses statistical models to estimate breakage based on historical redemption patterns. A change in assumptions as to the period over which mileage credits are expected to be redeemed, the actual redemption activity for mileage credits or the estimated fair value of mileage credits expected to be redeemed could have a material impact on our revenue in the year in which the change occurs and in future years. At December 31, 2012, the aggregate deferred revenue balance associated with the SkyMiles Program was $4.4 billion. A hypothetical 1% change in the number of outstanding miles estimated to be redeemed would result in a $30 million impact on our deferred revenue liability at December 31, 2012. Goodwill and Indefinite-Lived Intangible Assets We assess our goodwill and indefinite-lived intangible assets under a qualitative or quantitative approach. Under a qualitative approach, we consider many market factors, including those listed under Key Assumptions below. We analyze these market factors to determine if events and circumstances have affected the fair value of goodwill and indefinite-lived intangible assets. If we determine that it is more likely than not that the asset value may be impaired, we use the quantitative approach to assess the asset's fair value and the amount of the impairment. Under a quantitative approach, we calculate the fair value of the asset using the Key Assumptions listed below. If the asset's carrying value exceeds its fair value calculated using the quantitative approach, we will record an impairment charge for the difference in fair value and carrying value. When we evaluate goodwill for impairment using a quantitative approach, we estimate the fair value of the reporting unit by considering market capitalization and other factors. When we perform a quantitative impairment assessment of our indefinite-lived intangible assets, fair value is estimated based on (1) recent market transactions, where available, (2) a combination of limited market transactions and the lease savings method for certain airport slots (which reflects potential lease savings from owning the slots rather than leasing them from another airline at market rates), (3) the royalty method for the Delta tradename (which assumes hypothetical royalties generated from using our tradename) or (4) projected discounted future cash flows (an income approach). Key Assumptions. The key assumptions in our impairment tests include (1) our projected revenues, expenses and cash flows, (2) an estimated weighted average cost of capital, (3) assumed discount rates depending on the asset and (4) a tax rate. These assumptions are consistent with those hypothetical market participants would use. Since we are required to make estimates and assumptions when evaluating goodwill and indefinite-lived intangible assets for impairment, the actual amounts may differ materially from these estimates. In addition, we consider the amount the intangible assets' fair value exceeded their carrying value in the most recent fair value measurement using a quantitative approach. Changes in certain events and circumstances could result in impairment. Factors which could cause impairment include, but are not limited to, (1) negative trends in our market capitalization, (2) an increase in fuel prices, (3) declining passenger mile yields, (4) lower passenger demand as a result of a weakened U.S. and global economy, (5) interruption to our operations due to an employee strike, terrorist attack, or other reasons and (6) changes to the regulatory environment. We assessed each of the above assumptions in our most recent impairment analyses. The combination of our most recently completed annual results and our projected revenues, expenses and cash flows more than offset the impact of increasing fuel prices and other airline input costs. The stabilizing operating environment for U.S. airlines has resulted in annual yields increasing along with load factors, leading to improved financial results. Goodwill. Our goodwill balance was $9.8 billion at December 31, 2012 . We determined that there was no indication that Goodwill was impaired based upon our qualitative assessment of all relevant factors, including applicable factors noted in " Key Assumptions " above. 42 Identifiable Intangible Assets. Our identifiable intangible assets had a net carrying amount of $4.7 billion at December 31, 2012 . Indefinite-lived assets are not amortized and consist primarily of routes, slots, the Delta tradename and assets related to SkyTeam and collaborative arrangements. In 2012, we determined that there was no indication that our indefinite-lived intangible assets were impaired based upon our assessments. These assessments included analyses and weighting of all relevant factors, including the significant inputs and key assumptions which impact the fair value of our indefinite-lived intangible assets. Long-Lived Assets Our flight equipment and other long-lived assets have a recorded value of $20.7 billion at December 31, 2012 . This value is based on various factors, including the assets' estimated useful lives and salvage values. We record impairment losses on flight equipment and other long-lived assets used in operations when events and circumstances indicate the assets may be impaired and the estimated future cash flows generated by those assets are less than their carrying amounts. Factors which could cause impairment include, but are not limited to, (1) a decision to permanently remove flight equipment or other long-lived assets from operations, (2) significant changes in the estimated useful life, (3) significant changes in projected cash flows, (4) permanent and significant declines in fleet fair values and (5) changes to the regulatory environment. For long-lived assets held for sale, we discontinue depreciation and record impairment losses when the carrying amount of these assets is greater than the fair value less the cost to sell. To determine whether impairments exist for aircraft used in operations, we group assets at the fleet-type level (the lowest level for which there are identifiable cash flows) and then estimate future cash flows based on projections of capacity, passenger mile yield, fuel costs, labor costs and other relevant factors. If an impairment occurs, the impairment loss recognized is the amount by which the aircraft's carrying amount exceeds its estimated fair value. We estimate aircraft fair values using published sources, appraisals and bids received from third parties, as available. Income Tax Valuation Allowance We periodically assess whether it is more likely than not that we will generate sufficient taxable income to realize our deferred income tax assets. We establish valuation allowances if it is not likely we will realize our deferred income tax assets. In making this determination, we consider all available positive and negative evidence and make certain assumptions. We consider, among other things, our future projections of sustained profitability, deferred tax liabilities, the overall business environment, our historical financial results, our industry's historically cyclical financial results and potential current and future tax planning strategies. We recorded a full valuation allowance in 2004 due to our cumulative three year loss position at that time, compounded by the negative industry-wide business trends and outlook. At December 31, 2012, we had an $11.0 billion valuation allowance established against our deferred income tax assets, which represents a full valuation allowance against our net deferred income tax asset. During the March 2012 quarter, we moved from a cumulative loss position over the previous three years to a cumulative income position for the first time since we established a full valuation allowance. We have concluded as of December 31, 2012 that the valuation allowance was still needed on our net deferred tax assets based upon the weight of the factors described above, especially considering the history of losses. We continue to evaluate our cumulative income position and income trend as well as our future projections of sustained profitability and whether this profitability trend constitutes sufficient positive evidence to support a reversal of our valuation allowance (in full or in part). Defined Benefit Pension Plans We sponsor defined benefit pension plans for eligible employees and retirees. These plans are closed to new entrants and frozen for future benefit accruals. As of December 31, 2012 , the unfunded benefit obligation for these plans recorded on our Consolidated Balance Sheet was $13.3 billion . During 2012 , we contributed $697 million to these plans and recorded $368 million of expense in salaries and related costs on our Consolidated Statement of Operations. In 2013, we estimate we will contribute approximately $675 million to these plans and that our expense will be approximately $350 million. The most critical assumptions impacting our defined benefit pension plan obligations and expenses are the discount rate and the expected long-term rate of return on the plan assets. 43 Weighted Average Discount Rate. We determine our weighted average discount rate on our measurement date primarily by reference to annualized rates earned on high quality fixed income investments and yield-to-maturity analysis specific to our estimated future benefit payments. We used a weighted average discount rate to value the obligations of 4.11% and 4.94% at December 31, 2012 and 2011 , respectively. Our weighted average discount rate for net periodic pension benefit cost in each of the past three years has varied from the rate selected on our measurement date, ranging from 4.95% to 5.93% between 2010 and 2012 . Expected Long-Term Rate of Return. Our expected long-term rate of return on plan assets of 9% is based primarily on plan-specific investment studies using historical market return and volatility data. Modest excess return expectations versus some public market indices are incorporated into the return projections based on the actively managed structure of the investment programs and their records of achieving such returns historically. We also expect to receive a premium for investing in less liquid private markets. We review our rate of return on plan asset assumptions annually. Our annual investment performance for one particular year does not, by itself, significantly influence our evaluation. Our actual historical annualized 20-year rate of return on plan assets for our defined benefit pension plans exceeded 9% as of December 31, 2012 . The investment strategy for our defined benefit pension plan assets is to use a diversified mix of global public and private equity portfolios, public and private fixed income portfolios and private real estate and natural resource investments to earn a long-term investment return that meets or exceeds our annualized return target. Our expected long-term rate of return on assets for net periodic pension benefit cost for the year ended December 31, 2012 was 9%. The impact of a 0.50% change in these assumptions is shown in the table below: Change in Assumption Effect on 2013 Pension Expense Effect on Accrued Pension Liability at December 31, 2012 0.50% decrease in weighted average discount rate -$5 million +$1.4 billion 0.50% increase in weighted average discount rate - $1.3 billion 0.50% decrease in expected long-term rate of return on assets +$40 million 0.50% increase in expected long-term rate of return on assets - $40 million Funding. Our funding obligations for qualified defined benefit plans are governed by the Employee Retirement Income Security Act. The Pension Protection Act of 2006 allows commercial airlines to elect alternative funding rules ( Alternative Funding Rules ) for defined benefit plans that are frozen. Delta elected the Alternative Funding Rules under which the unfunded liability for a frozen defined benefit plan may be amortized over a fixed 17-year period and is calculated using an 8.85% interest rate. While the Pension Protection Act makes our funding obligations for these plans more predictable, factors outside our control continue to have an impact on the funding requirements. Estimates of future funding requirements are based on various assumptions and can vary materially from actual funding requirements. Assumptions include, among other things, the actual and projected market performance of assets; statutory requirements; and demographic data for participants. For additional information, see Note 11 of the Notes to the Consolidated Financial Statements. Recent Accounting Standards Presentation of Comprehensive Income In June 2011, the FASB issued "Presentation of Comprehensive Income." The standard revises the presentation and prominence of the items reported in other comprehensive income and is effective retrospectively for fiscal years beginning after December 15, 2011. We adopted this standard in 2012 and have presented comprehensive income in our Consolidated Statements of Comprehensive Income (Loss). 44 Supplemental Information We sometimes use information that is derived from the Consolidated Financial Statements, but that is not presented in accordance with accounting principles generally accepted in the U.S. ( GAAP ). Certain of this information are considered to be non-GAAP financial measures under the U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission rules. The non-GAAP financial measures should be considered in addition to results prepared in accordance with GAAP, but should not be considered a substitute for or superior to GAAP results. The following tables show reconciliations of non-GAAP financial measures to the most directly comparable GAAP financial measures. We exclude the following items from CASM to determine CASM-Ex: Aircraft fuel and related taxes. The volatility in fuel prices impacts the comparability of year-over-year financial performance. Management believes the exclusion of aircraft fuel and related taxes (including our contract carriers under capacity purchase arrangements) allows investors to better understand and analyze our non-fuel costs and our year-over-year financial performance. Ancillary businesses . Ancillary businesses are not related to the generation of a seat mile. These businesses include aircraft maintenance and staffing services we provide to third parties and our vacation wholesale operations. Profit sharing. Management believes the exclusion of this item provides a more meaningful comparison of our results to the airline industry and prior years' results. Restructuring and other items. Management believes the exclusion of this item is helpful to investors to evaluate our recurring core operational performance in the period shown. MTM adjustments. MTM adjustments are based on market prices as of the end of the reporting period for contracts settling in future periods . Such market prices are not necessarily indicative of the actual future value of the underlying hedge in the contract settlement period. Therefore, we adjust fuel expense for these items to arrive at a more meaningful measure of fuel cost. Year Ended December 31, 2012 2011 CASM 14.97 14.12 Items excluded: Aircraft fuel and related taxes (5.32 ) (5.00 ) Ancillary businesses (0.38 ) (0.37 ) Profit sharing (0.16 ) (0.11 ) Restructuring and other items (0.20 ) (0.10 ) MTM adjustments 0.01 (0.01 ) CASM-Ex 8.92 8.53 45 Glossary of Defined Terms ASM - Available Seat Mile. A measure of capacity. ASMs equal the total number of seats available for transporting passengers during a reporting period multiplied by the total number of miles flown during that period. CASM - (Operating) Cost per Available Seat Mile. The amount of operating cost incurred per ASM during a reporting period. CASM-Ex - The amount of operating cost incurred per ASM during a reporting period, excluding aircraft fuel and related taxes, ancillary businesses, profit sharing, restructuring and other items and MTM adjustments for fuel hedges recorded in periods other than the settlement period. Passenger Load Factor - A measure of utilized available seating capacity calculated by dividing RPMs by ASMs for a reporting period. Passenger Mile Yield or Yield - The amount of passenger revenue earned per RPM during a reporting period. PRASM - Passenger Revenue per ASM. The amount of passenger revenue earned per ASM during a reporting period. PRASM is also referred to as unit revenue. RPM - Revenue Passenger Mile. One revenue-paying passenger transported one mile. RPMs equal the number of revenue passengers during a reporting period multiplied by the number of miles flown by those passengers during that period. RPMs are also referred to as traffic. 46
