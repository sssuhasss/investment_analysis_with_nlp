Item 7. MANAGEMENT S DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS OF FINANCIAL CONDITION AND RESULTS OF OPERATIONS The following management discussion and analysis (MD&A) is intended to assist the reader in understanding Amgen business. MD&A is provided as a supplement to, and should be read in conjunction with, our consolidated financial statements and accompanying notes. Our results of operations discussed in MD&A are presented in conformity with accounting principles generally accepted in the United States (GAAP). Amgen operates in one business segment: human therapeutics. Therefore, our results of operations are discussed on a consolidated basis. Forward-looking statements This report and other documents we file with the SEC contain forward-looking statements that are based on current expectations, estimates, forecasts and projections about us, our future performance, our business, our beliefs and our management assumptions. In addition, we, or others on our behalf, may make forward-looking statements in press releases or written statements, or in our communications and discussions with investors and analysts in the normal course of business through meetings, webcasts, phone calls and conference calls. Such words as expect, anticipate, outlook, could, target, project, intend, plan, believe, seek, estimate, should, may, assume, and continue, as well as variations of such words and similar expressions are intended to identify such forward-looking statements. These statements are not guarantees of future performance and they involve certain risks, uncertainties and assumptions that are difficult to predict. We describe our respective risks, uncertainties and assumptions that could affect the outcome or results of operations in Item 1A. Risk Factors. We have based our forward-looking statements on our management beliefs and assumptions based on information available to our management at the time the statements are made. We caution you that actual outcomes and results may differ materially from what is expressed, implied or forecast by our forward-looking statements. Reference is made in particular to forward-looking statements regarding product sales, regulatory activities, clinical trial results, reimbursement, expenses, earnings per share (EPS), liquidity and capital resources, trends and planned dividends, stock repurchases and restructuring plans. Except as required under the federal securities laws and the rules and regulations of the SEC, we do not have any intention or obligation to update publicly any forward-looking statements after the distribution of this report, whether as a result of new information, future events, changes in assumptions or otherwise. Overview Amgen is committed to unlocking the potential of biology for patients suffering from serious illnesses by discovering, developing, manufacturing and delivering innovative human therapeutics. This approach begins by using tools like advanced human genetics to unravel the complexities of disease and understand the fundamentals of human biology. Amgen focuses on areas of high unmet medical need and leverages its biologics manufacturing expertise to strive for solutions that improve health outcomes and dramatically improve people's lives. A biotechnology pioneer since 1980, Amgen has grown to be one of the world's leading independent biotechnology companies, has reached millions of patients around the world and is developing a pipeline of medicines with breakaway potential. Our principal products include Neulasta , NEUPOGEN , ENBREL, XGEVA , Prolia , EPOGEN , Aranesp and Sensipar /Mimpara . For additional information about our products, see Part I, Item 1. Business Marketing, Distribution and Selected Marketed Products. Our strategy for long-term growth continues to focus on discovery and development of innovative medicines to address serious illnesses, development of branded biosimilars, global expansion, next-generation manufacturing of high quality biologics, development of improved biologic drug delivery systems and return of capital to shareholders. In 2014, we advanced our strategy. Revenues increased 7% driven by strong performance across the portfolio. Product sales grew 5% in the United States and 11% in the rest of the world (ROW). We continued returning capital to shareholders through the payment of dividends and through stock repurchases. We paid dividends of $0.61 per share of common stock in each of the four quarters of 2014, representing a 30% increase over the quarterly dividend paid in each of the four quarters of 2013. In December 2014, we declared a dividend of $0.79 per share of common stock, payable in March 2015, representing a 30% increase over the quarterly dividend paid in 2014. In October 2014, our Board of Directors approved an increase in our stock repurchase authorization that resulted in a total of $4.0 billion available under that program. We reinitiated repurchase activity in November 2014 and repurchased 0.9 million shares of our common stock at an aggregate cost of $153 million during the remainder of 2014. 42 In addition to delivering strong operating results, our innovative pipeline, which includes both internally-developed and externally-acquired opportunities, continued to advance in 2014, with the following milestones achieved: Clinical Program Lead Indication Milestone Repatha Dyslipidemia US submission EU submission Corlanor Chronic heart failure US submission Kyprolis * Multiple myeloma Phase 3 ASPIRE data Talimogene laherparepvec Metastatic melanoma US submission EU submission BLINCYTO Relapsed/refractory ALL US approval EU submission Brodalumab ** Moderate-to-severe plaque psoriasis Phase 3 data AMG 416 Secondary hyperparathyroidism Phase 3 data AMG 334 Migraine prophylaxis Phase 2b data (episodic) * Marketed by Onyx, an Amgen subsidiary ** Developed in collaboration with AstraZeneca During 2014, six of our medicines generated positive registration-enabling data and four were submitted for regulatory approval. In December 2014, the FDA approved BLINCYTO and the Neulasta Delivery Kit, including the On-body Injector for Neulasta . In 2014, we also advanced and expanded our biosimilar program, including announcing plans to add three more biosimilar molecules to our portfolio for a total of nine. Finally, in January 2015, we and Onyx announced the submission of a sNDA to the FDA and an MAA to the EMA for Kyprolis to seek approval for the treatment of patients with relapsed multiple myeloma who have received at least one prior therapy. We believe that we are uniquely positioned for the opportunities arising in biology and to deliver our strategy. We have near- and long-term growth opportunities ahead, including: (i) the approval and launch of new indications for Kyprolis in the United States and Europe as well as the approval and launch of several new innovative biologics, including Repatha and brodalumab, (ii) continuing to move into new geographic growth markets and (iii) the development, approval and launch of our biosimilars. We are present in more than 75 countries and, in 2014 we continued to expand into new geographic growth markets, including additional markets in Latin America, the Middle East and Asia. We announced a restructuring plan during the second half of 2014 that reduces our staff and our facilities footprint by the end of 2015. This restructuring plan allows us to invest in continuing innovation and the launch of our new pipeline molecules while improving our cost structure. We are also advancing a number of key initiatives to streamline processes, increase agility and efficiencies, and improve operating performance. These initiatives include improved contracting and sourcing, rationalizing discretionary spending, greater use of shared services and optimizing R&D efficiency. Also during 2014, we completed facilities construction and entered the licensure process for a Next-Generation Biomanufacturing facility in Singapore which we believe, when licensed, will enable us to increase our manufacturing productivity versus conventional alternatives at lower capital costs and operating expense. Our restructuring plan and our continued focus on increasing cost efficiencies in all areas of the company will enable us to reallocate resources to fund many of our growth opportunities to deliver value to patients and shareholders. Our business will continue to face various challenges. Certain of our products will face increasing competitive pressure as a result of competitive product launches. Additionally, certain of the existing patents on our principal products recently expired or will expire this year or over the next few years, and we expect to face increasing competition, including biosimilars. For additional information, including information on the expiration of patents for various products, see Part I, Item 1. Business Marketing, Distribution and Selected Marketed Products Patents and see Part I, Item 1. Business Marketing, Distribution and Selected Marketed Products Competition. Current global economic conditions also pose challenges to our business, including continued pressure to reduce healthcare expenditures. Efforts to reduce healthcare costs are being made by third-party payers including governments and private payers. In the United States, various actions have been taken aimed at reducing healthcare spending. The continuing prominence of U.S. budget deficits increases the risk that taxes, fees, rebates, or other federal measures that would further reduce our revenues or increase our expenses may be enacted. As a result of economic conditions, the industry continues to experience significant pricing pressures and other cost containment measures in certain non-U.S. countries also. 43 Our long-term success depends to a great extent on our ability to continue to discover, develop and commercialize innovative products and acquire or collaborate on therapies currently in development by other companies. The discovery and development of safe and effective new products, as well as the development of additional indications for existing products, are necessary for the continued strength of our business. We must develop new products over time in order to offset revenue losses when products lose their exclusivity or competing products are launched, as well as in order to provide for revenue and earnings growth. We devote considerable resources to R&D activities. However, successful product development in the biotechnology industry is highly uncertain. We are also confronted by increasing regulatory scrutiny of safety and efficacy both before and after products launch. Finally, our product sales can be affected by wholesaler and end-user buying patterns. These effects can cause fluctuations in quarterly product sales. For example, sales of certain of our products in the United States for the three months ended March 31 are usually lower relative to the preceding fourth quarter. These effects have generally not been significant when comparing full-year product performance to the prior year. See Part I, Item 1. Business Marketing, Distribution and Selected Marketed Products and Part I, Item 1A. Risk Factors for further discussion of certain of the factors that could impact our future product sales. Selected financial information The following is an overview of our results of operations (in millions, except percentages and per share data): Year ended December 31, Year ended December 31, 2014 Change 2013 Product sales: U.S. $ 14,732 5 % $ 14,045 ROW 4,595 11 % 4,147 Total product sales 19,327 6 % 18,192 Other revenues 736 52 % 484 Total revenues $ 20,063 7 % $ 18,676 Operating expenses $ 13,872 8 % $ 12,809 Operating income $ 6,191 6 % $ 5,867 Net income $ 5,158 2 % $ 5,081 Diluted EPS $ 6.70 1 % $ 6.64 Diluted shares 770 1 % 765 In the following discussion of changes in product sales, any reference to unit growth or decline refers to changes in the purchases of our products by healthcare providers, such as physicians or their clinics, dialysis centers, hospitals and pharmacies. The increase in U.S. product sales for 2014 reflects growth across the portfolio except for NEUPOGEN , which declined 28%. This overall growth was driven primarily by increases in average net sales prices and, to a lesser extent, unit growth, offset partially by a decline in wholesaler and, based on prescription data for ENBREL and Sensipar , end-user inventory levels. Also, 2014 included a full year of Kyprolis product sales as a result of the Onyx acquisition on October 1, 2013. The increase in ROW product sales for 2014 reflects growth primarily in our marketed products except ENBREL and Aranesp , which declined 4% and 2%, respectively. The ROW increase was driven by unit growth, offset partially by declines in average net sales prices. The increase in other revenues for 2014 was due primarily to a full year of Nexavar collaboration revenues as a result of the Onyx acquisition. The increase in operating expenses for 2014 was driven primarily by cost of sales and restructuring charges, offset partially by the end of the ENBREL profit share on October 31, 2013. The increase in net income for 2014 was due primarily to higher operating income, offset partially by a higher effective income tax rate. The increase in diluted EPS for 2014 was driven primarily by an increase in net income offset partially by an increase in diluted shares. Although changes in foreign currency exchange rates result in increases or decreases in our reported international product sales, the benefit or detriment that such movements have on our international product sales is offset partially by corresponding increases or decreases in our international operating expenses and our related foreign currency hedging activities. Our hedging 44 activities seek to offset the impacts, both positive and negative, that foreign currency exchange rate changes may have on our net income by hedging our net foreign currency exposure, primarily with respect to product sales denominated in euros. The net impact from changes in foreign currency exchange rates was not material in 2014, 2013 or 2012. Results of Operations Product sales Worldwide product sales were as follows (dollar amounts in millions): Year ended December 31, Year ended December 31, Year ended December 31, 2014 Change 2013 Change 2012 Neulasta /NEUPOGEN $ 5,755 (1 )% $ 5,790 8 % $ 5,352 ENBREL 4,688 3 % 4,551 7 % 4,236 XGEVA 1,221 20 % 1,019 36 % 748 Prolia 1,030 38 % 744 58 % 472 EPOGEN 2,031 4 % 1,953 1 % 1,941 Aranesp 1,930 1 % 1,911 (6 )% 2,040 Sensipar /Mimpara 1,158 6 % 1,089 15 % 950 Other products 1,514 33 % 1,135 26 % 900 Total product sales $ 19,327 6 % $ 18,192 9 % $ 16,639 Total U.S. $ 14,732 5 % $ 14,045 10 % $ 12,815 Total ROW 4,595 11 % 4,147 8 % 3,824 Total product sales $ 19,327 6 % $ 18,192 9 % $ 16,639 Future sales of our products will depend, in part, on the factors discussed in the Overview, Part 1 Item 1. Business Marketing, Distribution and Selected Marketed Products Competition, Part 1 Item 1A. Risk Factors and any additional factors discussed in the individual product sections below. In addition, for a list of our products' significant competitors, see Part 1 Item 1. Business Marketing, Distribution and Selected Marketed Products Competition. Neulasta /NEUPOGEN Total Neulasta and total NEUPOGEN sales by geographic region were as follows (dollar amounts in millions): Year ended December 31, Year ended December 31, Year ended December 31, 2014 Change 2013 Change 2012 Neulasta U.S. $ 3,649 4 % $ 3,499 9 % $ 3,207 Neulasta ROW 947 6 % 893 1 % 885 Total Neulasta 4,596 5 % 4,392 7 % 4,092 NEUPOGEN U.S. 839 (28 )% 1,169 16 % 1,007 NEUPOGEN ROW 320 40 % 229 (9 )% 253 Total NEUPOGEN 1,159 (17 )% 1,398 11 % 1,260 Total Neulasta /NEUPOGEN $ 5,755 (1 )% $ 5,790 8 % $ 5,352 The increase in global Neulasta sales for 2014 was driven primarily by an increase in the average net sales price in the United States. The decrease in global NEUPOGEN sales for 2014 was driven by the $155-million order from the U.S. government in 2013. Excluding the special order, U.S. and global sales declined 17% and 7%, respectively, which reflected decreases in unit demand in the United States, offset partially by the increased sales as a result of acquiring rights to filgrastim in certain regions effective January 1, 2014. In December 2014, the FDA granted approval of the Neulasta Delivery Kit, including the On-body Injector for Neulasta , which enables the healthcare provider to initiate administration of Neulasta on the same day as cytotoxic chemotherapy with delivery of the patient full dose of Neulasta the day following chemotherapy administration, consistent with the Neulasta prescribing information. The increase in global Neulasta sales for 2013 was driven by an increase in the average net sales price in the United States, offset partially by a decline in units. The increase in global NEUPOGEN sales for 2013 was driven by the $155-million order 45 from the U.S. government. Excluding the special order, U.S. sales grew only 1% and global sales declined 1%. Units declined in 2013 in both the United States and ROW. Our material U.S. patents for filgrastim (NEUPOGEN ) expired in December 2013. We face competition in the United States, which could have an impact over time on future sales of NEUPOGEN and, to a lesser extent, Neulasta . Our outstanding material U.S. patent for pegfilgrastim (Neulasta ) expires in 2015. Apotex, Inc. announced that the FDA accepted for filing their applications, under the abbreviated pathway, for pegfilgrastim, a biosimilar version of Neulasta , on December 17, 2014, and for filgrastim, a biosimilar version of NEUPOGEN , on February 17, 2015. On January 7, 2015, Sandoz, a Novartis company, announced that the FDA ODAC recommended approval of its investigational biosimilar filgrastim. The Sandoz biosimilar filgrastim is the subject of ongoing litigation between us and Sandoz. See Part 1, Item 1. Business Marketing, Distribution and Selected Marketed Products Competition and Part IV Note 18, Contingencies and commitments, to the Consolidated Financial Statements. Future Neulasta /NEUPOGEN sales will also depend, in part, on the development of new protocols, tests and/or treatments for cancer and/or new chemotherapy treatments or alternatives to chemotherapy that may have reduced and may continue to reduce the use of chemotherapy in some patients. ENBREL Total ENBREL sales by geographic region were as follows (dollar amounts in millions): Year ended December 31, Year ended December 31, Year ended December 31, 2014 Change 2013 Change 2012 ENBREL U.S. $ 4,404 3 % $ 4,256 7 % $ 3,967 ENBREL Canada 284 (4 )% 295 10 % 269 Total ENBREL $ 4,688 3 % $ 4,551 7 % $ 4,236 The increase in ENBREL sales for 2014 was driven primarily by an increase in the average net sales price offset partially by unfavorable changes in wholesaler and, based on prescription data, end-user inventories. The increase in ENBREL sales for 2013 was driven primarily by an increase in the average net sales price offset partially by slight unit declines. XGEVA and Prolia Total XGEVA and total Prolia sales by geographic region were as follows (dollar amounts in millions): Year ended December 31, Year ended December 31, Year ended December 31, 2014 Change 2013 Change 2012 XGEVA U.S. $ 857 12 % $ 764 19 % $ 644 XGEVA ROW 364 43 % 255 * 104 Total XGEVA 1,221 20 % 1,019 36 % 748 Prolia U.S. 625 35 % 462 58 % 292 Prolia ROW 405 44 % 282 57 % 180 Total Prolia 1,030 38 % 744 58 % 472 Total XGEVA /Prolia $ 2,251 28 % $ 1,763 45 % $ 1,220 * Change in excess of 100% The increases in global XGEVA and Prolia sales for 2014 and 2013 were driven primarily by unit growth. 46 EPOGEN Total EPOGEN sales were as follows (dollar amounts in millions): Year ended December 31, Year ended December 31, Year ended December 31, 2014 Change 2013 Change 2012 EPOGEN U.S. $ 2,031 4 % $ 1,953 1 % $ 1,941 The increase in EPOGEN sales for 2014 was driven by an increase in the average net sales price offset partially by unit declines. EPOGEN sales for 2013 increased by 1% due to unit growth. Our remaining material U.S. patent for EPOGEN expires in May 2015. As a result, we may face competition in the United States, which may have a material adverse impact over time on EPOGEN sales. In addition, EPOGEN and Aranesp will face competition from the launch of MIRCERA in the United States. Roche began selling MIRCERA in October 2014 in the United States under terms of a limited patent license obtained from Amgen in connection with the settlement of patent litigation. MIRCERA competes with Aranesp in the nephrology segment only. On December 16, 2014, Hospira, Inc. submitted a BLA to the FDA for Retacrit , a proposed biosimilar to EPOGEN , under the abbreviated pathway. In addition, future EPOGEN sales will also depend, in part, on such factors as response to changes in reimbursement, including the reduction to the ESRD payment bundle effective January 1, 2014, and changes in dose utilization as healthcare providers continue to refine their treatment practices in accordance with approved labeling. See Part 1, Item 1. Business Marketing, Distribution and Selected Marketed Products Competition. Aranesp Total Aranesp sales by geographic region were as follows (dollar amounts in millions): Year ended December 31, Year ended December 31, Year ended December 31, 2014 Change 2013 Change 2012 Aranesp U.S. $ 794 6 % $ 747 (4 )% $ 782 Aranesp ROW 1,136 (2 )% 1,164 (7 )% 1,258 Total Aranesp $ 1,930 1 % $ 1,911 (6 )% $ 2,040 The increase in U.S. Aranesp sales for 2014 was driven by an increase in the average net sales price and, to a lesser extent, unit demand. The decrease in ROW Aranesp sales for 2014 reflects price declines offset partially by unit demand in international markets. The decrease in U.S. Aranesp sales for 2013 was driven by declines in unit demand. The unit declines reflect changes in practice patterns resulting from changes to the label and to the reimbursement environment that occurred during 2011. The decrease in ROW Aranesp sales for 2013 reflects unit declines and price pressure in Europe. Sensipar /Mimpara Total Sensipar /Mimpara sales by geographic region were as follows (dollar amounts in millions): Year ended December 31, Year ended December 31, Year ended December 31, 2014 Change 2013 Change 2012 Sensipar U.S. $ 796 5 % $ 757 18 % $ 639 Sensipar /Mimpara ROW 362 9 % 332 7 % 311 Total Sensipar /Mimpara $ 1,158 6 % $ 1,089 15 % $ 950 The increases in global Sensipar /Mimpara sales for 2014 and 2013 were driven primarily by unit growth and increases in the average net sales price in the United States; however, the increases in 2014 were offset partially by unfavorable changes in U.S. wholesaler and, based on prescription data, end-user inventories. 47 Other products Other product sales by geographic region were as follows (dollar amounts in millions): Year ended December 31, Year ended December 31, Year ended December 31, 2014 Change 2013 Change 2012 Vectibix U.S. $ 168 33 % $ 126 3 % $ 122 Vectibix ROW 337 28 % 263 11 % 237 Nplate U.S. 260 8 % 241 13 % 214 Nplate ROW 209 12 % 186 21 % 154 Kyprolis U.S. 306 * 71 N/A Kyprolis ROW 25 * 2 N/A BLINCYTO U.S. 3 N/A N/A Other ROW 206 (16 )% 246 42 % 173 Total other product sales $ 1,514 33 % $ 1,135 26 % $ 900 Total U.S. other products $ 737 68 % $ 438 30 % $ 336 Total ROW other products 777 11 % 697 24 % 564 Total other product sales $ 1,514 33 % $ 1,135 26 % $ 900 * Change in excess of 100% Operating expenses Operating expenses were as follows (dollar amounts in millions): Year ended December 31, Year ended December 31, Year ended December 31, 2014 Change 2013 Change 2012 Operating expenses: Cost of sales $ 4,422 32 % $ 3,346 5 % $ 3,199 % of product sales 22.9 % 18.4 % 19.2 % % of total revenues 22.0 % 17.9 % 18.5 % Research and development $ 4,297 5 % $ 4,083 21 % $ 3,380 % of product sales 22.2 % 22.4 % 20.3 % % of total revenues 21.4 % 21.9 % 19.6 % Selling, general and administrative $ 4,699 (9 )% $ 5,184 8 % $ 4,814 % of product sales 24.3 % 28.5 % 28.9 % % of total revenues 23.4 % 27.8 % 27.9 % Other $ 454 * $ 196 (34 )% $ 295 * Change in excess of 100% Restructuring We announced a restructuring plan during the second half of 2014 to invest in continuing innovation and the launch of our new pipeline molecules while improving our cost structure. As part of the plan, we stated that we would reduce our staff by 3,500 to 4,000 by the end of 2015 and close our facilities in Washington state and Colorado and reduce the number of buildings at our headquarters in Thousand Oaks, California. Company-wide, these actions will result in an approximate 23% reduction in our facilities footprint. We estimate that these actions will result in pre-tax accounting charges in the range of $935 million to $1,035 million . During the year ended December 31, 2014, we initiated the above-noted actions and incurred $558 million of restructuring costs. We expect that substantially all remaining restructuring actions and related estimated costs will be incurred in 2015. 48 Net savings were not significant in 2014 due to investments in later stage clinical programs, new product launch preparation and external business development. Additional information required for our restructuring plan is incorporated herein by reference to Part IV Note 2, Restructuring and other cost savings initiatives, to the Consolidated Financial Statements. Cost of sales Cost of sales increased to 22.0% of total revenues for 2014, driven by acquisition-related expenses that included an increase of $642 million of non-cash amortization of intangible assets acquired in the Onyx acquisition. The year ended December 31, 2014, also included impairment and accelerated depreciation charges pursuant to our restructuring initiative of $104 million and a $99-million charge related to the termination of the supply contract with Roche as a result of acquiring the licenses to filgrastim and pegfilgrastim effective January 1, 2014. Cost of sales decreased to 17.9% of total revenues for 2013, driven primarily by lower royalties and higher average net sales prices, offset partially by changes in product mix. The excise tax imposed by Puerto Rico on the gross intercompany purchase price of goods and services from our manufacturer in Puerto Rico (Puerto Rico excise tax) also slightly contributed to the decrease. The rate was 3.75% in 2012, 2.75% in the first half of 2013 and 4.0% effective July 1, 2013 through December 31, 2017. See Part IV Note 5, Income taxes, to the Consolidated Financial Statements for further discussion of the Puerto Rico excise tax. Excluding the impact of the excise tax, cost of sales would have been 20.1%, 16.0% and 16.5% of total revenues for 2014 , 2013 and 2012 , respectively. Research and development R&D costs are expensed as incurred and include primarily salaries, benefits and other staff-related costs; facilities and overhead costs; clinical trial and related clinical manufacturing costs; contract services and other outside costs; information systems costs and amortization of acquired technology used in R&D with alternative future uses. R&D expenses also include costs and cost recoveries associated with K-A and third-party R&D arrangements, including upfront fees and milestones paid to third parties in connection with technologies which had not reached technological feasibility and did not have an alternative future use. Net payment or reimbursement of R&D costs is recognized when the obligations are incurred or as we become entitled to the cost recovery. The Company groups all of its R&D activities and related expenditures into three categories: (1) Discovery Research and Translational Sciences (DRTS), (2) later stage clinical programs and (3) marketed products. These categories include the Company R&D activities as set forth in the following table: Category Description DRTS R&D expenses incurred in activities substantially in support of early research through the completion of phase 1 clinical trials. These activities encompass our DRTS functions, including drug discovery, toxicology, pharmacokinetics and drug metabolism, and process development. Later stage clinical programs R&D expenses incurred in or related to phase 2 and phase 3 clinical programs intended to result in registration of a new product or a new indication for an existing product in the United States or the EU. Marketed products R&D expenses incurred in support of the Company marketed products that are authorized to be sold in the United States or the EU. Includes clinical trials designed to gather information on product safety (certain of which may be required by regulatory authorities) and their product characteristics after regulatory approval has been obtained, as well as the costs of obtaining regulatory approval of a product in a new market after approval in either the United States or the EU has been obtained. R&D expense by category was as follows (in millions): Years ended December 31, 2014 2013 2012 DRTS $ 1,212 $ 1,233 $ 1,137 Later stage clinical programs 2,287 1,950 1,285 Marketed products 798 900 958 Total R&D expense $ 4,297 $ 4,083 $ 3,380 49 The increase in R&D expense for 2014 was driven primarily by increased costs of $326 million associated with Onyx across all categories of R&D spend, as well as increased costs associated with other later stage clinical program support. Overall, costs associated with later stage clinical programs support increased $337 million, offset partially by reduced expenses associated with marketed products support of $102 million and DRTS activities of $21 million. DRTS expenses included a $60 million upfront payment related to our cancer immunotherapy collaboration with Kite Pharma, Inc. The increase in R&D expense for 2013 was driven primarily by an increase of $665 million in our later stage clinical programs, including evolocumab and Kyprolis ; and an increase of $96 million in DRTS activities, offset partially by reduced expenses associated with marketed products support of $58 million. Selling, general and administrative SG&A expenses are comprised primarily of salaries, benefits and other staff-related costs associated with sales and marketing, finance, legal and other administrative personnel; facilities and overhead costs; outside marketing, advertising and legal expenses; the BPD fee; and other general and administrative costs. Advertising costs are expensed as incurred. SG&A expenses also include costs and cost recoveries associated with marketing and promotion efforts under certain collaboration arrangements. Net payment or reimbursement of SG&A costs is recognized when the obligations are incurred or we become entitled to the cost recovery. The decrease in SG&A expense for 2014 was driven primarily by the expiration of the ENBREL profit share in October 2013, which reduced expenses by $818 million. That decline was offset partially by the addition of $183 million as a result of the Onyx acquisition, an additional $129 million accrual for the BPD fee as the final regulations accelerated the expense recognition criteria for the fee obligation by one year and increased commercial expenses of $109 million in preparation for new product launches. Historically, under our ENBREL collaboration agreement, we paid Pfizer a percentage of annual gross profits on our ENBREL sales in the United States and Canada on a scale that increased with gross profits. The ENBREL co-promotion term expired on October 31, 2013, and we are required to pay Pfizer residual royalties on a declining percentage of net ENBREL sales in the United States and Canada. The royalty percentage was 12% through October 31, 2014, declining to 11% through October 31, 2015 and 10% through October 31, 2016. The increase in SG&A expense for 2013 was driven primarily by the addition of Onyx of $276 million, of which $215 million was acquisition-related. Included in these costs are advisory, legal and regulatory costs, and compensation-related payments. The compensation payments include cash payments for accelerated vesting of equity awards as part of the acquisition that were previously granted under the Onyx equity award programs which would not have otherwise vested. SG&A also increased by $98 million related primarily to favorable changes in 2012 to the estimated BPD fee. Other Other operating expenses for 2014 included certain charges related to our restructuring plan, primarily separation costs of $377 million. It also included a $46 million write-off of a non-key IPR&D program acquired in a prior year business combination. Other operating expenses for 2013 included $113 million of adjustments to our estimated contingent consideration liability related to the BioVex Group, Inc. (BioVex) business combination, certain charges related to our other cost savings initiatives of $71 million, which included severance expenses, and $12 million of other charges related primarily to legal proceedings. Other operating expenses for 2012 included charges of $175 million related to our other cost savings initiatives, which included severance and expenses associated with abandoning leased facilities, legal charges of $64 million and other operating expenses of $56 million, comprised primarily of adjustments to our estimated contingent consideration liability related to the BioVex business combination. Non-operating expenses/income and provision for income taxes Non-operating expenses/income and provision for income taxes were as follows (dollar amounts in millions): Years ended December 31, 2014 2013 2012 Interest expense, net $ 1,071 $ 1,022 $ 1,053 Interest and other income, net $ 465 $ 420 $ 485 Provision for income taxes $ 427 $ 184 $ 664 Effective tax rate 7.6 % 3.5 % 13.3 % 50 Interest expense, net The increase in interest expense, net in 2014 was due primarily to a higher average balance of debt outstanding offset partially by lower average borrowing rates compared with 2013. The decrease in interest expense, net in 2013 compared with 2012 was due primarily to the decrease in non-cash interest resulting from the settlement of our 0.375% 2013 Convertible Notes in February 2013 offset partially by increases resulting from the higher average balance of other outstanding debt and financing fees paid in association with the acquisition of Onyx. Interest and other income, net The increase in interest and other income, net for 2014 compared with 2013 was due primarily to interest earned as a result of a higher average balance of cash and investments offset partially by a reduction in income realized from the sale of investments recognized in 2014. The decrease in interest and other income, net for 2013 compared with 2012 was due primarily to a reduction in income from the sale of investments recognized in 2013. Income taxes The increase in our effective tax rate for 2014 compared with 2013 was due primarily to two significant events that occurred during 2013. First, the settlement of our examination with the Internal Revenue Service (IRS) for the years ended December 31, 2007, 2008 and 2009, in which we agreed to certain adjustments proposed by the IRS and remeasured our unrecognized tax benefits (UTBs) accordingly, resulting in a benefit of approximately $185 million. Second, because the American Taxpayer Relief Act of 2012 was not enacted until 2013, certain provisions of the Act benefiting the Company's 2012 federal taxes, including the retroactive extension of the R&D tax credit for 2012, were not recognized in the Company's 2012 financial results and instead are reflected in the Company's 2013 financial results. Therefore, our effective tax rate for 2013 included an additional $70 million benefit for the full-year 2012 R&D tax credit. The increase was offset partially by the favorable tax impact of changes in the jurisdictional mix of income and expenses due primarily to higher domestic acquisition-related expenses and restructuring costs in 2014. The decrease in our effective rate for 2013 compared with 2012 was due primarily to three significant events occurring in 2013: (i) we settled our examination with the IRS for the years ended December 31, 2007, 2008 and 2009, as discussed above; (ii) costs associated with the acquisition of Onyx, which resulted in a tax benefit of approximately $180 million; and (iii) the reinstatement of the federal R&D tax credit for 2012 and 2013, as discussed above. Additionally, our rate was further reduced by the favorable tax impact of changes in the jurisdictional mix of income and expenses. The effective tax rates for 2014, 2013 and 2012 would have been approximately 12.8%, 9.2%, and 18.7%, respectively, without the impact of the tax credits associated with the Puerto Rico excise tax. As permitted under U.S. GAAP, we do not provide for U.S. income taxes on undistributed earnings of our foreign operations that are intended to be invested indefinitely outside the United States. See Summary of Critical Accounting Policies Income taxes and Part IV Note 5, Income taxes, to the Consolidated Financial Statements for further discussion. Financial Condition, Liquidity and Capital Resources Selected financial data was as follows (in millions): December 31, 2014 2013 Cash, cash equivalents and marketable securities $ 27,026 $ 19,401 Restricted investments 3,412 Total cash, cash equivalents, marketable securities and restricted investments $ 27,026 $ 22,813 Total assets 69,009 66,125 Current portion of long-term debt 500 2,505 Long-term debt 30,215 29,623 Stockholders equity 25,778 22,096 The Company intends to continue to return capital to stockholders through the payment of cash dividends and share repurchases, reflecting our confidence in the future cash flows of our business. The amount we spend, the number of shares repurchased and the timing of such repurchases will vary based on a number of factors, including the stock price, the availability of financing on acceptable terms, the amount and timing of dividends and blackout periods in which we are restricted from repurchasing shares; and the manner of purchases may include private block purchases, tender offers and market transactions. 51 Whether and when we declare dividends and the size of any dividend could be affected by a number of additional factors. (See Part I, Item 1A. Risk Factors There can be no assurance that we will continue to declare cash dividends or that we will repurchase stock). The Board of Directors declared quarterly cash dividends of $0.36 per share of common stock in 2012, increased our quarterly cash dividend by 31% to $0.47 per share of common stock in 2013 and increased our quarterly cash dividend by 30% to $0.61 per share of common stock in 2014. In December 2014, the Board of Directors declared a dividend of $0.79 per share of common stock, an increase of 30%, to be paid in March 2015. The Company has also returned capital to stockholders through its stock repurchase program. During 2012, we spent $4.6 billion to repurchase shares of our common stock, and an additional $832 million during the first quarter of 2013, after which repurchases were temporarily suspended. In October 2014, the Board of Directors authorized an increase to the stock repurchase program that resulted in a total of $4.0 billion available. We reinitiated repurchasing activity under the program and, during the fourth quarter of 2014, we repurchased $153 million of stock, of which $138 million was paid in cash by December 31, 2014. As of December 31, 2014, $3.8 billion remains available under the Board of Directors-approved stock repurchase program. We believe that existing funds, cash generated from operations and existing sources of and access to financing are adequate to satisfy our needs for working capital; capital expenditure and debt service requirements; our plans to pay dividends and repurchase stock; and other business initiatives we plan to strategically pursue, including acquisitions and licensing activities. We anticipate that our liquidity needs can be met through a variety of sources, including cash provided by operating activities, sales of marketable securities, borrowings through commercial paper and/or our syndicated credit facilities and access to other domestic and foreign debt markets and equity markets. With respect to our U.S. operations, we believe that existing funds intended for use in the United States; cash generated from our U.S. operations, including intercompany payments and receipts; and existing sources of and access to financing (collectively referred to as U.S. funds ) are adequate to continue to meet our U.S. obligations (including our plans to pay dividends and repurchase stock with U.S. funds) for the foreseeable future. See Part I, Item 1A. Risk Factors Global economic conditions may negatively affect us and may magnify certain risks that affect our business. A significant portion of our operating cash flows is dependent on the timing of payments from our customers located in the United States and, to a lesser extent, our customers outside the United States, which include government-owned or -supported healthcare providers (government healthcare providers). Payments from these government healthcare providers are dependent in part on the economic stability and creditworthiness of their applicable country. Historically, some payments from a number of European government healthcare providers have extended beyond the contractual terms of sale, and regional economic uncertainty continues. In particular, credit and economic conditions in Southern Europe, particularly in Spain, Italy, Greece and Portugal, continue to adversely impact the timing of collections of our trade receivables in this region. As of December 31, 2014 and 2013, accounts receivable in these four countries totaled $223 million and $419 million, respectively. Of these receivables, $124 million and $301 million were past due as of December 31, 2014 and 2013, respectively. Although economic conditions in this region may continue to affect the average length of time it takes to collect payments, to date we have not incurred any significant losses related to these receivables; and the timing of payments in these countries has not had nor is it currently expected to have a material adverse impact on our overall operating cash flows. However, if government funding for healthcare were to become unavailable in these countries or if significant adverse adjustments to past payment practices were to occur, we might not be able to collect the entire balance of these receivables. We will continue working closely with these customers, monitoring the economic situation and taking appropriate actions as necessary. Cash, cash equivalents, and marketable securities Of our total cash, cash equivalents and marketable securities totaling approximately $27.0 billion as of December 31, 2014 , approximately $25.7 billion was generated from operations in foreign tax jurisdictions and is intended to be invested indefinitely outside the United States. Under current tax laws, if these funds were repatriated for use in our U.S. operations, we would be required to pay additional income taxes at the tax rates then in effect. The primary objective of our investment portfolio is to enhance overall returns in an efficient manner while maintaining safety of principal, prudent levels of liquidity and acceptable levels of risk. Our investment policy limits interest-bearing security investments to certain types of debt and money market instruments issued by institutions with primarily investment grade credit ratings and places restrictions on maturities and concentration by asset class and issuer. Financing arrangements The current and noncurrent portions of our long-term borrowings at December 31, 2014 , were $ 0.5 billion and $ 30.2 billion, respectively. The current and noncurrent portions of our long-term borrowings at December 31, 2013 , were $ 2.5 billion and $ 29.6 billion, respectively. As of December 31, 2014, Standard & Poor Financial Services LLC (S&P), Moody Investor Service, Inc. (Moody's) and Fitch, Inc. (Fitch) assigned credit ratings to our outstanding senior notes of A with a stable outlook, Baa1 with a stable outlook and BBB with a negative outlook, respectively, which are considered investment grade. Unfavorable changes to 52 these ratings may have an adverse impact on future financings and would affect the interest rate paid under our Term Loan Credit Facility. During the years ended December 31, 2014 , 2013 and 2012, we issued long-term debt with aggregate principal amounts of $4.5 billion, $8.1 billion, and $5.0 billion, respectively. During the years ended December 31, 2014 , 2013 and 2012, we repaid debt of $5.6 billion, $3.4 billion, and $123 million, respectively. For information regarding specific issuances and repayments of debt, see Part IV Note 14, Financing arrangements, to the Consolidated Financial Statements. To achieve a desired mix of fixed and floating interest rate debt, we entered into interest rate swap contracts that effectively converted a fixed-rate interest coupon for certain of our debt issuances to a floating London Interbank Offered Rates (LIBOR)-based coupon over the life of the respective note. These interest rate swap contracts qualified and are designated as fair value hedges. In 2014 and 2013, we entered into interest rate swap contracts with aggregate notional amounts of $2.25 billion and $4.4 billion, respectively. In addition, we previously had interest rate swap contracts on debt with an aggregate face value of $3.6 billion which, due to historically low interest rates, were terminated in May 2012. See Part IV Note 14, Financing arrangements, and Note 17, Derivative instruments, to the Consolidated Financial Statements for further discussion of our interest rate swap contracts. To hedge our exposure to foreign currency exchange rate risk associated with certain of our long-term notes denominated in foreign currencies, we entered into cross-currency swap contracts, which effectively convert the interest payments and principal repayment of the respective notes from euros/pounds sterling to U.S. dollars. These cross-currency swap contracts qualify and are designated as cash flow hedges. As of December 31, 2014 and 2013 , we had cross-currency swap contracts with aggregate notional amounts of $2.7 billion. See Part IV Note 17, Derivative instruments, to the Consolidated Financial Statements for further discussion of our cross-currency swap contracts. As of December 31, 2014 , we had a commercial paper program that allows us to issue up to $2.5 billion of unsecured commercial paper to fund our working capital needs. At December 31, 2014 and 2013 , we had no amounts outstanding under our commercial paper program. In July 2014, we entered into a $2.5 billion syndicated, unsecured, revolving credit agreement which is available for general corporate purposes or as a liquidity backstop to our commercial paper program. This agreement amended and restated our previous revolving credit agreement on substantially similar terms. The commitments under the revolving credit agreement may be increased by up to $500 million with the agreement of the banks. Each bank which is a party to the agreement has an initial commitment term of five years. This term may be extended for up to two additional one-year periods with the agreement of the banks. Annual commitment fees for this agreement are 0.1% based on our current credit rating. Generally, we would be charged interest at LIBOR plus 0.9% for any amounts borrowed under this facility. As of December 31, 2014 and 2013 , no amounts were outstanding under this facility. In February 2014, we filed a shelf registration statement with the SEC which allows us to issue unspecified amounts of debt securities; common stock; preferred stock; warrants to purchase debt securities, common stock, preferred stock or depository shares; rights to purchase common stock or preferred stock; securities purchase contracts; securities purchase units; and depository shares. Under this shelf registration statement, all of the securities available for issuance may be offered from time to time with terms to be determined at the time of issuance. This shelf registration statement expires in February 2017. In 1997, we established a $400 million medium-term note program under which medium-term debt securities may be offered from time to time with terms to be determined at the time of issuance. As of December 31, 2014 and 2013 , no securities were outstanding under this medium-term note program. Certain of our financing arrangements contain non-financial covenants. In addition, our revolving credit agreement and Term Loan Credit Facility each includes a financial covenant with respect to the level of our borrowings in relation to our equity, as defined. We were in compliance with all applicable covenants under these arrangements as of December 31, 2014 . See Part IV Note 14, Financing arrangements, to the Consolidated Financial Statements for further discussion of our financing arrangements. 53 Cash flows A summary of our cash flow activity was as follows (in millions): Years ended December 31, 2014 2013 2012 Net cash provided by operating activities $ 8,555 $ 6,291 $ 5,882 Net cash used in investing activities (5,752 ) (8,469 ) (9,990 ) Net cash (used in) provided by financing activities (2,877 ) 2,726 419 Operating Cash provided by operating activities has been and is expected to continue to be our primary recurring source of funds. Cash provided by operating activities increased during 2014 due primarily to higher revenues, higher operating income, including the impact of the expiration of the ENBREL co-promotion term on October 31, 2013, and improvements in working capital. Cash provided by operating activities increased during 2013 due primarily to the 2012 impacts of the payment associated with a legal settlement and higher payments to taxing authorities, offset partially by cash receipts in 2012 of $397 million in connection with the termination of interest rate swap agreements and $197 million received under a government-funded program in Spain with regard to trade receivables. Investing Capital expenditures, which were associated primarily with manufacturing capacity expansions in Singapore, Puerto Rico and Ireland, as well as other site developments, totaled $ 718 million, $ 693 million and $ 689 million in 2014 , 2013 and 2012 , respectively. We currently estimate 2015 spending on capital projects and equipment to be approximately $800 million. Cash used in investing activities during the years ended December 31, 2014, 2013 and 2012, also included the cost of acquiring certain businesses, net of cash acquired, which totaled $ 165 million , $ 9.4 billion and $ 2.4 billion , respectively. In addition, during the year ended December 31, 2014, $285 million was used to purchase intangible assets. Net activity related to marketable securities and restricted investments used $ 4.4 billion for 2014 and provided $ 1.7 billion for 2013 . Net purchases of marketable securities totaled $ 6.9 billion for 2012 . Financing Cash used in financing activities during 2014 was due primarily to the repayment of long-term debt of $5.6 billion , the payment of dividends of $1.9 billion and repurchases of our common stock of $ 138 million . These payments were offset partially by net proceeds from the issuance of long-term debt of $4.5 billion and net proceeds from the issuance of common stock in connection with the Company's equity award programs of $ 186 million . Cash provided by financing activities during 2013 was due primarily to net proceeds from the issuance of long-term debt of $8.1 billion and net proceeds from the issuance of common stock in connection with the Company's equity award programs of $296 million . These receipts were offset partially by the repayment of long-term debt of $3.4 billion , the payment of dividends of $1.4 billion and repurchases of our common stock of $832 million . Cash used in financing activities during 2012 was due primarily to net proceeds from the issuance of long-term debt of $4.9 billion and net proceeds from the issuance of common stock in connection with the Company's equity award programs of $1.3 billion , offset partially by repurchases of common stock of $ 4.6 billion and the payment of dividends of $ 1.1 billion . See Part IV Note 14, Financing arrangements, and Note 15, Stockholders equity, to the Consolidated Financial Statements for further discussion. Off-Balance Sheet Arrangements We do not have any off-balance sheet arrangements that are material or reasonably likely to become material to our consolidated financial position or consolidated results of operations. Contractual Obligations Contractual obligations represent future cash commitments and liabilities under agreements with third parties, and exclude contingent liabilities for which we cannot reasonably predict future payment. Additionally, the expected timing of payment of the obligations presented below is estimated based on current information. Timing of payments and actual amounts paid may be different depending on the timing of receipt of goods or services or changes to agreed-upon terms or amounts for some obligations. 54 The following table represents our contractual obligations aggregated by type (in millions): Payments due by period as of December 31, 2014 Year Years Years Years Contractual obligations Total 1 2 and 3 4 and 5 6 and beyond Long-term debt obligations (1) (2) (3) (4) $ 48,262 $ 1,611 $ 8,985 $ 9,579 $ 28,087 Operating lease obligations 1,034 135 323 282 294 Purchase obligations (5) 3,398 1,377 811 401 809 UTBs (6) Total contractual obligations $ 52,694 $ 3,123 $ 10,119 $ 10,262 $ 29,190 (1) Long-term debt obligations include future interest payments which are included in our financing arrangements at the fixed contractual coupon rates. To achieve a desired mix of fixed and floating interest rate debt, we enter into interest rate swap contracts that effectively convert a fixed rate interest coupon for certain of our debt issuances to a floating LIBOR-based coupon over the life of the respective note. We used an interest rate forward curve at December 31, 2014, in computing net amounts to be paid or received under our interest rate swap contracts which resulted in an aggregate net increase in future interest payments of $272 million. See Part IV Note 14, Financing arrangements, to the Consolidated Financial Statements for further discussion of our interest swap contracts. (2) Long-term debt obligations include future interest payments under our Term Loan at LIBOR-based variable rates of interest. We used an interest rate forward curve at December 31, 2014, in computing interest payments on this debt obligation. See Part IV Note 14, Financing arrangements, to the Consolidated Financial Statements for further discussion of this debt obligation. (3) Long-term debt obligations include contractual interest payments and principal repayment of our foreign denominated debt obligations. In order to hedge our exposure to foreign currency exchange rate risk associated with certain of our pound sterling and euro denominated long-term debt, we entered into cross-currency swap contracts that effectively convert interest payments and principal repayment on this debt from euros/pounds sterling to U.S. dollars. For purposes of this table, we used the contracted exchange rates in the cross-currency swap contracts to compute the net amounts of future interest payments and principal repayments on this debt. See Part IV Note 17, Derivative instruments, to the Consolidated Financial Statements for further discussion of our cross-currency swap contracts. (4) Interest payments and the repayment of principal on our 4.375% 2018 euro Notes were translated into U.S. dollars at the foreign currency exchange rate in effect at December 31, 2014. See Part IV Note 14, Financing arrangements, to the Consolidated Financial Statements for further discussion of our long-term debt obligations. (5) Purchase obligations relate primarily to: (i) R&D commitments (including those related to clinical trials) for new and existing products; (ii) capital expenditures; (iii) open purchase orders for the acquisition of goods and services in the ordinary course of business; and (iv) a $225 million payment due to the former shareholders of Proteolix, Inc. in settlement of contingent consideration assumed in the acquisition of Onyx (see Note 16, Fair value measurement to the Consolidated Financial Statements). Our obligation to pay certain of these amounts may be reduced based on certain future events. (6) Liabilities for UTBs (net of foreign tax credits and federal tax benefit of state taxes) and related accrued interest and penalties totaling approximately $1.7 billion at December 31, 2014 , are not included in the table above because, due to their nature, there is a high degree of uncertainty regarding the timing of future cash outflows and other events that extinguish these liabilities. In addition to amounts in the table above, we are contractually obligated to pay additional amounts, which in the aggregate are significant, upon the achievement of various development, regulatory and commercial milestones for agreements we have entered into with third parties, including contingent consideration incurred in the acquisition of BioVex. These payments are contingent upon the occurrence of various future events, substantially all of which have a high degree of uncertainty of occurring. These contingent payments have not been included in the table above, and, except with respect to the fair value of the contingent consideration obligations, are not recorded on our Consolidated Balance Sheets. As of December 31, 2014 , the maximum amount that may be payable in the future for agreements we have entered into with third parties is approximately $3.0 billion, including $450 million of contingent consideration payments in connection with the acquisition of BioVex. See Part IV Note 16, Fair value measurement to the Consolidated Financial Statements. 55 Summary of Critical Accounting Policies The preparation of our consolidated financial statements in conformity with U.S. GAAP requires management to make estimates and assumptions that affect the amounts reported in the financial statements and the notes to the financial statements. Some of those judgments can be subjective and complex, and therefore, actual results could differ materially from those estimates under different assumptions or conditions. Product sales and sales deductions Revenues from sales of our products are recognized when the products are shipped and title and risk of loss have passed. Product sales are recorded net of accruals for estimated rebates, wholesaler chargebacks, cash discounts and other deductions (collectively, sales deductions ) and returns, which are established at the time of sale. We analyze the adequacy of our accruals for sales deductions quarterly. Amounts accrued for sales deductions are adjusted when trends or significant events indicate that adjustment is appropriate. Accruals are also adjusted to reflect actual results. Amounts recorded in Accrued liabilities in the Consolidated Balance Sheets for sales deductions were as follows (in millions): Rebates Chargebacks Other deductions Total Balance as of January 1, 2012 $ 1,047 $ 199 $ 80 $ 1,326 Amounts charged against product sales 1,480 2,709 659 4,848 Payments (1,680 ) (2,741 ) (624 ) (5,045 ) Balance as of December 31, 2012 847 167 115 1,129 Amounts charged against product sales 1,784 3,008 669 5,461 Payments (1,736 ) (2,924 ) (682 ) (5,342 ) Balance as of December 31, 2013 895 251 102 1,248 Amounts charged against product sales 2,499 3,399 688 6,586 Payments (2,274 ) (3,454 ) (727 ) (6,455 ) Balance as of December 31, 2014 $ 1,120 $ 196 $ 63 $ 1,379 For the years ended December 31, 2014 , 2013 and 2012 , total sales deductions were 25%, 23% and 23% of gross product sales, respectively. Included in these amounts are immaterial adjustments related to prior-year sales due to changes in estimates. Such amounts represent 3% or less of the aggregate sales deductions charged against product sales in each of the three years ended December 31, 2014 . In the United States, we utilize wholesalers as the principal means of distributing our products to healthcare providers, such as physicians or their clinics, dialysis centers, hospitals and pharmacies. Products we sell in Europe are distributed principally to hospitals and/or wholesalers depending on the distribution practice in each country where the product is sold. We monitor the inventory levels of our products at our wholesalers by using data from our wholesalers and other third parties, and we believe wholesaler inventories have been maintained at appropriate levels (generally two to three weeks) given end-user demand. Accordingly, historical fluctuations in wholesaler inventory levels have not significantly impacted our method of estimating sales deductions and returns. Accruals for sales deductions are based primarily on estimates of the amounts earned or to be claimed on the related sales. These estimates take into consideration current contractual and statutory requirements, specific known market events and trends, internal and external historical data and forecasted customer buying patterns. Sales deductions are substantially product-specific and, therefore, for any given year, can be impacted by the mix of products sold. Rebates include primarily amounts paid to payers and providers in the United States, including those paid to state Medicaid programs, and are based on contractual arrangements or statutory requirements which vary by product, by payer and individual payer plans. As we sell product, we estimate the amount of rebate that will be paid by us based on the product sold, contractual terms, estimated patient population, historical experience and wholesaler inventory levels and accrue these rebates in the period the related sale is recorded. We then adjust the rebate accruals as more information becomes available and to reflect actual claims experience. Estimating such rebates is complicated, in part, due to the time delay between the date of sale and the actual settlement of the liability, which can take more than one year. We believe the methodology we use to accrue for rebates is reasonable and appropriate given current facts and circumstances. However, actual results may differ. For example, we had managed Medicaid rebate adjustments of $164 million in 2013. Changes in annual estimates related to prior annual periods were less than 2% of the estimated rebate amounts charged against product sales for the year ended December 31, 2014, and less than 10% for the years ended December 31, 2013 and 2012, including the aforementioned adjustment. A 10% change in our rebate estimate attributable 56 to rebates recognized in 2014 would have had an impact of approximately $250 million, or approximately 1% of our 2014 product sales and a corresponding impact on our financial condition and liquidity. Wholesaler chargebacks relate to our contractual agreements to sell products to healthcare providers in the United States at fixed prices that are lower than the prices we charge wholesalers. When healthcare providers purchase our products through wholesalers at these reduced prices, wholesalers charge us for the difference between their purchase price and the contractual price between Amgen and the healthcare providers. The provision for chargebacks is based on the expected sales by our wholesaler customers to healthcare providers. Accruals for wholesaler chargebacks are less difficult to estimate than rebates and closely approximate actual results since chargeback amounts are fixed at the date of purchase by the healthcare providers, and we generally settle the liability for these deductions within a few weeks. Product returns Returns are estimated through comparison of historical return data to their related sales on a production lot basis. Historical rates of return are determined for each product and are adjusted for known or expected changes in the marketplace specific to each product, when appropriate. In each of the last three years, sales return provisions have amounted to less than 1% of gross product sales. Changes in estimates for prior year sales return provisions have historically been insignificant. Income taxes The Company provides for income taxes based on pretax income and applicable tax rates available in the various jurisdictions in which it operates. We recognize the tax benefit from an uncertain tax position only if it is more likely than not that the tax position will be sustained on examination by the taxing authorities based on the technical merits of the position. The tax benefits recognized in the financial statements on a particular tax position are measured based on the largest benefit that is more likely than not to be realized. The amount of UTBs is adjusted as appropriate for changes in facts and circumstances, such as significant amendments to existing tax law, new regulations or interpretations by the taxing authorities, new information obtained during a tax examination, or resolution of an examination. We believe our estimates for uncertain tax positions are appropriate and sufficient for any assessments that may result from examinations of our tax returns. We recognize both accrued interest and penalties, where appropriate, related to UTBs in income tax expense. Certain items are included in the Company's tax return at different times than they are reflected in the financial statements and cause temporary differences between the tax bases of assets and liabilities and their reported amounts. Such temporary differences create deferred tax assets and liabilities. Deferred tax assets are generally items that can be used as a tax deduction or credit in the tax return in future years but for which the Company has already recorded the tax benefit in the financial statements. The Company establishes valuation allowances against its deferred tax assets when the amount of expected future taxable income is not likely to support the use of the deduction or credit. Deferred tax liabilities are either: (i) tax expenses recognized in the financial statements for which payment has been deferred; (ii) expenses for which the Company has already taken a deduction on the tax return, but has not yet recognized the expense in the financial statements; or (iii) liabilities for the difference between the book basis and tax basis of the intangible assets acquired in many business combinations, as future expenses associated with these assets most often will not be tax deductible. The Company is a vertically integrated enterprise with operations in the United States and various foreign jurisdictions. The Company is subject to income tax in the foreign jurisdictions where it conducts activities based on the tax laws and principles of such jurisdictions and the functions, risks and activities performed therein. The Company pretax income is therefore attributed to domestic or foreign sources based on the operations performed in each location and the tax laws and principles of the respective taxing jurisdictions. For example, the Company conducts significant operations outside the United States in Puerto Rico pertaining to manufacturing, distribution and other related functions to meet its worldwide product demand. Income from the Company operations in Puerto Rico is subject to a tax incentive grant that expires in 2020. Our effective tax rate reflects the impact of undistributed foreign earnings for which no U.S. income taxes or foreign withholding taxes have been provided because such earnings are intended to be invested indefinitely outside the United States. Substantially all of this benefit is attributable to the Company foreign income associated with the Company operations conducted in Puerto Rico. If future events, including material changes in cash, working capital and long-term investment requirements necessitate that certain assets associated with these earnings be repatriated to the United States, under current tax laws an additional tax provision and related liability would be required at the applicable income tax rates which could have a material adverse effect on both our future effective tax rate and our financial results. 57 Our operations are subject to the tax laws, regulations and administrative practices of the United States, U.S. state jurisdictions and other countries in which we do business. Significant changes in these rules could have a material adverse effect on the Company's results of operations. See Part I, Item 1A. Risk Factors The adoption of new tax legislation or exposure to additional tax liabilities could affect our profitability. Contingencies In the ordinary course of business, we are involved in various legal proceedings and other matters such as intellectual property disputes, contractual disputes, governmental investigations and class action suits which are complex in nature and have outcomes that are difficult to predict. Certain of these proceedings are discussed in Part IV Note 18, Contingencies and commitments, to the Consolidated Financial Statements. We record accruals for loss contingencies to the extent that we conclude that it is probable that a liability has been incurred and the amount of the related loss can be reasonably estimated. We consider all relevant factors when making assessments regarding these contingencies. While it is not possible to accurately predict or determine the eventual outcomes of these items, an adverse determination in one or more of these items currently pending could have a material adverse effect on our consolidated results of operations, financial position or cash flows. Valuation of assets and liabilities in connection with business combinations We have acquired and continue to acquire intangible assets in connection with business combinations. These intangible assets consist primarily of technology associated with currently marketed human therapeutic products and IPR&D product candidates. Discounted cash flow models are typically used to determine the fair values of these intangible assets for purposes of allocating consideration paid to the net assets acquired in a business combination. These models require the use of significant estimates and assumptions, including, but not limited to: determining the timing and expected costs to complete in-process projects taking into account the stage of completion at the acquisition date; projecting the probability and timing of obtaining marketing approval from the FDA and other regulatory agencies for product candidates; estimating the timing of and future net cash flows from product sales resulting from completed products and in-process projects; and developing appropriate discount rates to calculate the present values of the cash flows. Significant estimates and assumptions are also required to determine the acquisition date fair values of any contingent consideration obligations incurred in connection with business combinations. In addition, we must revalue these obligations each subsequent reporting period until the related contingencies are resolved and record changes in their fair values in earnings. The acquisition date fair values of various contingent consideration obligations incurred or assumed in the acquisitions of businesses (see Part IV Note 3, Business combinations, and Note 16, Fair value measurement, to the Consolidated Financial Statements) were determined using a combination of valuation techniques. Significant estimates and assumptions required for these valuations included, but were not limited to, the probability of achieving regulatory milestones, product sales projections under various scenarios and discount rates used to calculate the present value of the required payments. These estimates and assumptions are required to be updated in order to revalue these contingent consideration obligations each reporting period. Accordingly, subsequent changes in underlying facts and circumstances could result in changes in these estimates and assumptions, which could have a material impact on the estimated future fair values of these obligations. We believe the fair values used to record intangible assets acquired and contingent consideration obligations incurred in connection with business combinations are based upon reasonable estimates and assumptions given the facts and circumstances as of the related valuation dates. Impairment of long-lived assets We review the carrying value of our property, plant and equipment and our finite-lived intangible assets for impairment whenever events or changes in circumstances indicate that the carrying amount of an asset may not be recoverable. If such circumstances exist, an estimate of undiscounted future cash flows to be generated by the long-lived asset is compared to the carrying value to determine whether an impairment exists. If an asset is determined to be impaired, the loss is measured based on the difference between the asset's fair value and its carrying value. 58 Indefinite-lived intangible assets, composed of IPR&D projects acquired in a business combination which have not reached technological feasibility, are reviewed annually for impairment and whenever events or changes in circumstances indicate that the carrying amount may not be recoverable. We determine impairment by comparing the fair value of the asset to its carrying value. If the asset's carrying value exceeds its fair value, an impairment charge is recorded for the difference and its carrying value is reduced accordingly. Estimating future cash flows of an IPR&D product candidate for purposes of an impairment analysis requires us to make significant estimates and assumptions regarding the amount and timing of costs to complete the project and the amount, timing and probability of achieving revenues from the completed product similar to how the acquisition date fair value of the project was determined, as described above. There are often major risks and uncertainties associated with IPR&D projects as we are required to obtain regulatory approvals in order to be able to market these products. Such approvals require completing clinical trials that demonstrate a product candidate is safe and effective. Consequently, the eventual realized value of the acquired IPR&D project may vary from its estimated fair value at the date of acquisition, and IPR&D impairment charges may occur in future periods which could have a material adverse effect on our results of operations. We believe our estimations of future cash flows used for assessing impairment of long-lived assets are based on reasonable assumptions given the facts and circumstances as of the related dates of the assessments.
