OVERVIEW We are a specialty retailer of automotive aftermarket parts, tools, supplies, equipment and accessories in the United States. We are one of the largest automotive aftermarket specialty retailers, selling our products to both do-it-yourself ( DIY ) customers and professional service providers. Our stores carry an extensive product line consisting of new and remanufactured automotive hard parts, maintenance items, accessories, a complete line of auto body paint and related materials, automotive tools and professional service provider service equipment. Our extensive product line includes an assortment of products that are differentiated by quality and price for most of the product lines we offer. For many of our product offerings, this quality differentiation reflects good , better , and best alternatives. Our sales and total gross margin dollars are highest for the best quality category of products. Consumers willingness to select products at a higher point on the value spectrum is a driver of sales and profitability in our industry. As of December 31, 2011, we operated 3,740 stores in 39 states. Operating within the retail industry, we are influenced by a number of general macroeconomic factors including, but not limited to, fuel costs, unemployment rates, consumer preferences and spending habits and competition. The difficult conditions that affected the overall macroeconomic environment in recent years continue to impact O Reilly and the retail sector in general. We believe that the average consumer tendency has been to trade-down to lower quality products during the recent challenging macroeconomic conditions. We have ongoing initiatives aimed at tailoring our product offering to adjust to customers changing preferences; however, we also continue to have initiatives focused on marketing and training to educate customers on the advantages of purchasing up on the value spectrum. We have ongoing initiatives targeted at marketing higher quality products to our customers and expect our customers to be more willing to return to purchasing up on the value spectrum in the future as the U.S. economy recovers; however, we cannot predict whether, when, or the manner in which, these economic conditions will change. 25 Table of Contents We believe the key drivers of current and future demand of the products sold within the automotive aftermarket include the number of U.S. miles driven, number of U.S. registered vehicles, new light vehicle registrations, average vehicle age and unemployment. Number of Miles Driven - The number of total miles driven in the U.S. heavily influences the demand for the repair and maintenance products sold within the automotive aftermarket. Historically, the long-term trend in the total miles driven in the U.S. has steadily increased; however, according to the Department of Transportation, total miles driven in the U.S. have remained relatively flat since 2007 as the U.S. has experienced difficult macroeconomic conditions. Historically, rapid increases in gasoline prices have negatively impacted U.S. total miles driven as consumers react to the increased expense by reducing travel. Average gasoline prices increased 7% in 2011, compared to an increase of 18% in 2010. We believe that as the U.S. economy recovers and gasoline prices stabilize, annual miles driven will return to historical growth rates and continue to drive demand for the industry. Number of U.S. Registered Vehicles, New Light Vehicle Registrations and Average Vehicle Age - The total number of vehicles on the road and the average age of the U.S. vehicle population also heavily influence the demand for products sold within the automotive aftermarket. As reported by the Automotive Aftermarket Industry Association ( AAIA ), the total number of registered vehicles has increased 17% over the past decade, from 205 million light vehicles in 2000 to 240 million light vehicles in 2010. New light vehicle registrations, however, have declined 34% over the past decade, from 17 million registrations in 2000 to 11 million registrations in 2010. As of December 31, 2011, the seasonally adjusted annual rate of sales of total light vehicles in the U.S. was 13 million, indicating that the trend of declining new light vehicle registrations has reversed, however total sales of light vehicles has remained below historical rates for the past three years, contributing to an aging U.S. vehicle population. As reported by the AAIA, the average age of the U.S. vehicle population has increased 19% over the past decade, from 8.9 years in 2000 to 10.6 years in 2010. We believe this increase in average age can be attributed to better engineered and manufactured vehicles, which can be reliably driven at higher miles due to better quality power trains and interiors and exteriors; depressed new car sales over the past three years at below historical levels; and the consumer willingness to invest in maintaining their higher-mileage, better built vehicles. As the average age of the vehicle on the road increases, a larger percentage of miles are being driven by vehicles which are outside of a manufacturer warranty. These out-of-warranty, older vehicles generate strong demand for automotive aftermarket products as they go through more routine maintenance cycles, have more frequent mechanical failures and generally require more maintenance than newer vehicles. Based on this change in consumer sentiment surrounding the length of time older vehicles can be reliably driven at higher mileages, we believe consumers will continue to keep their vehicles even longer as the economy recovers maintaining the trend of an aging vehicle population. Unemployment - Unemployment rates and continued uncertainty surrounding the overall economic health of the U.S. have had a negative impact on consumer confidence and the level of consumer discretionary spending. The annual U.S. unemployment rate over the past two years has remained at 30-year highs. We believe macroeconomic uncertainties and the potential for future joblessness can motivate consumers to find ways to save money, which can be an important factor in the consumer decision to defer the purchase of a new vehicle and maintain their existing vehicle. While the deferral of vehicle purchases has led to an increase in vehicle maintenance, long-term trends of high unemployment could continue to impede the growth of annual miles driven, as well as decrease consumer discretionary spending, both of which negatively impact demand for products sold in the automotive aftermarket. We believe that as the economy recovers, unemployment will return to more historic levels and we will see a corresponding increase in commuter traffic as unemployed individuals return to work. Aided by these increased commuter miles, overall annual U.S. miles driven should begin to grow resulting in continued demand for automotive aftermarket products. KEY EVENTS AND RECENT DEVELOPMENTS Several key events have had or may have a significant impact on our operations and are identified below: On January 11, 2011, we announced a new Board-approved share repurchase program that authorized us to repurchase up to $500 million of shares of our common stock over a three-year period. Under the program, we may, from time to time, repurchase shares of our common stock, solely through open market purchases effected through a broker dealer at prevailing market prices, based on a variety of factors such as price, corporate trading policy requirements and overall market conditions. Our Board of Directors approved resolutions to increase the authorization under the share repurchase program by an additional $500 million on August 5, 2011, and an additional $500 million on November 16, 2011, raising the cumulative authorization under the share repurchase program to $1.5 billion. The additional $500 million authorizations are effective for three-year periods, expiring on August 5, 2014, and November 16, 2014. Our Board of Directors may increase or otherwise modify, renew, suspend or terminate the share repurchase program at any time, without prior notice. As of February 28, 2012, we had repurchased approximately 16.5 million shares of our common stock at an aggregate cost of $1 billion under this program. On January 14, 2011, we issued $500 million aggregate principal amount of unsecured 4.875% Senior Notes due 2021 ( 4.875% Senior Notes due 2021 ) in the public market with United Missouri Bank, N.A. ( UMB ) as trustee, which were guaranteed by certain of our subsidiaries (the Subsidiary Guarantors ). The 4.875% Senior Notes due 2021 were issued at 99.297% of their face value and will mature on January 14, 2021. The proceeds from the 4.875% Senior Notes due 2021 issuance were used to repay all of our outstanding borrowings under our existing secured asset-based revolving credit facility 26 Table of Contents (the ABL Credit Facility ), pay fees and expenses related to the offering and for general corporate purposes. Concurrent with the issuance of the 4.875% Senior Notes due 2021, we entered into a 5-year credit agreement for a $750 million unsecured revolving credit facility (the Revolving Credit Facility ) arranged by Bank of America ( BA ) and Barclays Capital to provide additional financial flexibility. All remaining debt issuance costs related to our previous ABL Credit Facility, totaling $22 million were written off, and all interest rate swap agreements related to notional amounts under the ABL Credit Facility, with a carrying value of $4 million, were terminated and charged to earnings as one-time, non-recurring items upon the repayment and retirement of the ABL Credit Facility in January of 2011, which is included in Other income (expense) on the accompanying Consolidated Statements of Income. On September 9, 2011, we amended our Revolving Credit Facility with BA, which decreased the facility to $660 million and reduced the fees and interest rate margins for borrowings under our Revolving Credit Facility. The amendment also extended the maturity of our Revolving Credit Facility to September of 2016. In conjunction with the amendment to our Revolving Credit Facility, we recognized a one-time charge related to the modification to the credit facility in the amount of $0.3 million, which is included in Other income (expense) on the accompanying Consolidated Statements of Income. On September 19, 2011, we issued $300 million aggregate principal amount of unsecured 4.625% Senior Notes due 2021 ( 4.625% Senior Notes due 2021 ) in the public market with UMB as trustee, which were guaranteed by the Subsidiary Guarantors. The 4.625% Senior Notes due 2021 were issued at 99.826% of their face value and will mature on September 15, 2021. The proceeds from the issuance of the 4.625% Senior Notes due 2021 were used to pay fees and expenses related to the offering, with the remainder for general corporate purposes, including share repurchases. RESULTS OF OPERATIONS The following table includes income statement data as a percentage of sales for the years ended December 31, 2011, 2010 and 2009: 2011 2010 2009 Sales 100.0 % 100.0 % 100.0 % Cost of goods sold, including warehouse and distribution expenses 51.0 51.4 52.0 Gross profit 49.0 48.6 48.0 Selling, general and administrative expenses 34.1 35.0 36.9 Former CSK officer clawback (0.1 ) Legacy CSK DOJ investigation charge 0.4 Operating income 15.0 13.2 11.1 Interest expense (0.5 ) (0.7 ) (0.9 ) Interest income 0.1 Write-off of asset-based revolving credit facility debt issuance costs (0.4 ) Termination of interest rate swap agreements (0.1 ) Gain on settlement of note receivable 0.2 Other income, net 0.1 0.1 Income before income taxes 14.1 12.8 10.3 Provision for income taxes 5.3 5.0 4.0 Net income 8.8 % 7.8 % 6.3 % 2011 Compared to 2010 Sales: Sales for the year ended December 31, 2011, increased $391 million to $5.79 billion from $5.40 billion for the same period one year ago, representing an increase of 7.2%. Comparable store sales for stores open at least one year increased 4.6% and 8.8% for the years ended December 31, 2011 and 2010, respectively. Comparable store sales are calculated based on the change in sales of stores open at least one year and exclude sales of specialty machinery, sales to independent parts stores and sales to Team Members. 27 Table of Contents The following table presents the components of the increase in sales for the year ended December 31, 2011 (in millions): Increase in Sales for the year ended December 31, 2011, compared to the same period in 2010 Store sales: Comparable store sales $ 241 Non-comparable store sales: Sales for stores opened throughout 2010, excluding stores open at least one year that are included in comparable store sales 70 Sales in 2010 for stores that have closed (13 ) Sales for stores opened throughout 2011 82 Non-store sales: Includes sales of machinery, sales to independent parts stores and team member sales 11 Total increase in sales $ 391 We believe the increased sales achieved by our stores are the result of high levels of customer service, superior inventory availability, a broader selection of products offered in most stores, a targeted promotional and advertising effort through a variety of media and localized promotional events, continued improvement in the merchandising and store layouts of our stores, compensation programs for all store Team Members that provide incentives for performance and our continued focus on serving both DIY and professional service provider customers. Our comparable store sales increase for the year was driven by an increase in average ticket values, partially offset by a decline in customer transaction counts. The improvement in average ticket values was the result of the continued growth of the higher priced, hard part categories as a percentage of our total sales, and the impact of increased raw material acquisition costs, which were passed through to increased selling prices during the period. The growth in the hard part categories is driven by the increase of professional service provider sales as a percentage of our total sales mix and a shift in DIY sales to the hard part categories. During the year, DIY customer transaction counts were negatively impacted by the continued pressure on disposable income that our customers faced as a result of increased fuel costs and sustained unemployment levels above historical averages, which offset strong increases in professional service provider transaction counts. We opened 170 net, new stores during the year ended December 31, 2011, compared to 149 net, new stores for the year ended December 31, 2010. At December 31, 2011, we operated 3,740 stores in 39 states compared to 3,570 stores in 38 states at December 31, 2010. We anticipate new store unit growth to increase to 180 net, new stores in 2012. Gross profit: Gross profit for the year ended December 31, 2011, increased to $2.84 billion (or 49.0% of sales) from $2.62 billion (or 48.6% of sales) for the same period one year ago, representing an increase of 8%. The increase in gross profit dollars was primarily a result of the increase in sales from new stores and the increase in comparable store sales at existing stores. The increase in gross profit as a percentage of sales was primarily due to a favorable product mix, improved acquisition costs, improved inventory shrinkage and distribution center efficiencies, partially offset by the impact of increased professional service provider sales as a percentage of the total sales mix. The improvement in product mix was primarily driven by increased sales in the hard part categories, which typically generate a high gross profit as a percentage of sales. Increasing hard part sales is the result of strong demand as consumers retain and maintain their vehicles beyond manufacturer warranty periods and our strong growth in sales to professional service providers in the acquired markets. The improved shrinkage is driven by our converted CSK stores, which are now managed using the O Reilly point-of-sale system ( POS ), installed in all CSK stores as they converted to the O Reilly distribution systems throughout 2009 and 2010. The O Reilly POS provides our store managers with better tools to track and control inventory, resulting in improved inventory shrinkage. Distribution center efficiencies are the result of leverage on increased sales volumes and more tenured and experienced distribution center Team Members in our newer DCs. Professional service provider sales in the acquired CSK markets are growing at a faster rate than total DIY sales as a result of the enhanced distribution model in those markets, which supports the implementation of our dual market strategy. Professional service provider sales typically carry a lower overall gross profit as a percentage of sales than DIY sales, as volume discounts are granted on wholesale transactions to professional service providers, consequently creating pressure on our gross profit as a percentage of sales. Selling, general and administrative expenses: Selling, general and administrative expenses ( SG&A ) for the year ended December 31, 2011, increased to $1.97 billion (or 34.1% of sales) from $1.89 billion (or 35.0% of sales) for the same period one year ago, representing an increase of 5%. The increase in total SG&A dollars was primarily the result of additional employees, facilities and vehicles to support our increased store count. The decrease in SG&A as a percentage of sales was primarily the result of increased leverage of store occupancy and headquarters costs on strong comparable store sales, improved store payroll efficiencies and positive trends related to health benefits, partially offset by increased fuel costs for our store delivery vehicles supporting our growing commercial business. 28 Table of Contents Operating income: Operating income for the year ended December 31, 2011, increased to $867 million (or 15.0% of sales) from $713 million (or 13.2% of sales) for the same period one year ago, representing an increase of 22%. The increase in operating income during the year was primarily due to the impacts discussed above, as well as $3 million of nonrecurring income in the current year related to a settlement between the Securities and Exchange Commission ( SEC ) and a former CSK officer that resulted in the reimbursement to CSK of incentive-based compensation and stock sale profits previously received by the officer (discussed in detail below see Note 12 Legal Matters to the Consolidated Financial Statements) versus a $21 million charge to operating income in the prior year, related to the previously announced legacy CSK DOJ investigation (discussed in detail below see Note 12 Legal Matters to the Consolidated Financial Statements). The increase in operating income as a percentage of sales is the result of our improvements in gross margin and significant leverage on fixed SG&A from strong comparable store sales. Other income and expense: Total other expense for the year ended December 31, 2011, increased to $51 million (or 0.9% of sales), from $23 million (or 0.4% of sales) for the same period one year ago, representing an increase of 118%. The increase in total other expense for the year was primarily due to one-time charges related to our new financing transactions that were completed in January of 2011 (discussed in detail below), offset by decreased interest expense on a lower average interest rate on outstanding borrowings, a lower facility fee on our revolving credit facility and less amortization of debt issuance costs in the current period as compared to the borrowing rates, facility fee and amortization of debt issuance costs in the prior period. In addition, during 2010, we recognized a nonrecurring, non-operating gain of $12 million related to the favorable settlement of a note receivable acquired in the acquisition of CSK (discussed in detail below). Income taxes: Our provision for income taxes for the year ended December 31, 2011, increased to $308 million (37.8% effective tax rate) from $270 million (39.2% effective tax rate) for the same period one year ago, representing an increase of 14%. The increase in our provision for income taxes was due to the increase in our taxable income. The decrease in the effective rate was primarily the result of the $21 million charge recorded in 2010 related to the legacy United States Department of Justice ( DOJ ) investigation of CSK, discussed in detail below, which was not deductible for tax purposes. Net income: As a result of the impacts discussed above, net income for the year ended December 31, 2011, increased to $508 million (or 8.8% of sales), from $419 million (or 7.8% of sales) for the same period one year ago, representing an increase of 21%. Earnings per share: Our diluted earnings per common share for the year ended December 31, 2011, increased 26% to $3.71 on 137 million shares from $2.95 on 142 million shares for the same period one year ago. The impact of share repurchases during 2011 on diluted earnings per share was an increase of approximately $0.19. Adjustments for nonrecurring and non-operating events: Our results for the year ended December 31, 2011, included nonrecurring income related to a settlement between the SEC and a former CSK officer that resulted in the reimbursement to O Reilly, as successor issuer to CSK, of $3 million ($2 million, net of tax) of incentive-based compensation and stock sale profits previously received by the officer. This clawback amount was included in Operating income on our Consolidated Statements of Income for the year ended December 31, 2011. Our results for the year ended December 31, 2011, also included one-time charges associated with the new financing transactions we completed on January 14, 2011. The one-time charges included a non-cash charge to write off the balance of debt issuance costs related to our previous ABL Credit Facility in the amount of $22 million ($13 million, net of tax) and a charge related to the termination of our interest rate swap agreements in the amount of $4 ($3 million, net of tax). The charges related to our new financing transactions were included in Other income (expense) on our Consolidated Statements of Income for the year ended December 31, 2011. Our results for the year ended December 31, 2010, included a nonrecurring, non-operating gain in Other income (expense) of $12 million ($7 million, net of tax) related to the favorable settlement of a note receivable acquired in the CSK acquisition, as well as a charge related to the legacy DOJ investigation into CSK pre-acquisition historical accounting practices. We accrued $21 million during 2010 in anticipation of executing a Non-Prosecution Agreement ( NPA ) among the DOJ, CSK and O Reilly and paying a one-time monetary penalty of $21 million. During the third quarter of 2011, the NPA was executed and the previously recorded, one-time $21 million penalty was paid to the DOJ on behalf of CSK. The charge related to the legacy CSK DOJ investigation was included in Operating income on our Consolidated Statements of Income for the year ended December 31, 2010. The results discussed in the paragraph below are adjusted for these nonrecurring items and are reconciled to the most directly comparable GAAP measure in the subsequent table. Adjusted operating income for the year ended December 31, 2011, increased 18% to $864 million (or 14.9% of sales) from $734 million (or 13.6% of sales) for the same period one year ago. Adjusted net income for the year ended December 31, 2011, increased 21% to $522 million (or 9.0% of sales) from $433 million (or 8.0% of sales) for the same period one year ago. Adjusted diluted earnings per common share for the years ended December 31, 2011, increased 25% to $3.81 from $3.05 for the same period one year ago. 29 Table of Contents The table below outlines the impact of the charges related to the new financing transactions, the former CSK officer clawback, the legacy CSK DOJ investigation charge, as well as the gain on the settlement of the note receivable for the years ended December 31, 2011 and 2010 (amounts in thousands, except per share data): For the Year Ended December 31, 2011 2010 Amount % of Sales Amount % of Sales GAAP Operating income $ 866,766 15.0 % $ 712,776 13.2 % Former CSK officer clawback (2,798 ) (0.1 )% % Legacy CSK DOJ investigation charge % 20,900 0.4 % Non-GAAP adjusted operating income $ 863,968 14.9 % $ 733,676 13.6 % GAAP net income $ 507,673 8.8 % $ 419,373 7.8 % Write-off of asset-based revolving credit facility debt issuance costs, net of tax 13,458 0.2 % % Termination of interest rate swap agreements, net of tax 2,637 % % Former CSK officer clawback, net of tax (1,741 ) % % Legacy CSK DOJ investigation charge % 20,900 0.4 % Gain on settlement of note receivable, net of tax % (7,215 ) (0.2 )% Non-GAAP adjusted net income $ 522,027 9.0 % $ 433,058 8.0 % GAAP diluted earnings per common share $ 3.71 $ 2.95 Write-off of asset-based revolving credit facility debt issuance costs, net of tax 0.09 Termination of interest rate swap agreements, net of tax 0.02 Former CSK DOJ officer clawback, net of tax (0.01 ) Legacy CSK DOJ investigation charge 0.15 Gain on settlement of note receivable, net of tax (0.05 ) Non-GAAP adjusted diluted earnings per common share $ 3.81 $ 3.05 Weighted-average common shares outstanding - assuming dilution 136,983 141,992 The financial information presented in the paragraph and table above is not derived in accordance with United States generally accepted accounting principles ( GAAP ). We do not, nor do we suggest investors should, consider such non-GAAP financial measures in isolation from, or as a substitute for, GAAP financial information. We believe that the presentation of financial results and estimates excluding the impact of the non-cash charge to write off the balance of debt issuance costs, the charge related to the termination of interest rate swap contracts, the former CSK officer clawback, the charges for the legacy CSK DOJ investigation and the nonrecurring, non-operating gain related to the settlement of a note receivable acquired in the acquisition of CSK, provide meaningful supplemental information to both management and investors, which is indicative of our core operations. We exclude these items in judging our performance and believe this non-GAAP information is useful to investors as well. Material limitations of these non-GAAP measures are that such measures do not reflect actual GAAP amounts. We compensate for such limitations by presenting, in the table above, the accompanying reconciliation to the most directly comparable GAAP measures. 2010 Compared to 2009 Sales: Sales for the year ended December 31, 2010, increased $550 million to $5.4 billion from $4.85 billion for the same period one year ago, representing an increase of 11%. Comparable store sales are calculated based on the change in sales of stores open at least one year and exclude sales of specialty machinery, sales to independent parts stores, sales to Team Members and sales during the one- to two-week period certain CSK branded stores were closed for conversion. Comparable store sales for stores open at least one year increased 8.8% and 4.6% for the year ended December 31, 2010 and 2009, respectively. 30 Table of Contents The following table presents the components of the increase in sales for the year ended December 31, 2010 (in millions): Increase in Sales for the year ended December 31, 2010, compared to the same period in 2009 Store sales: Comparable store sales $ 417 Non-comparable store sales: Sales for stores opened throughout 2009, excluding stores open at least one year that are included in comparable store sales 56 Sales in 2009 for stores that have closed (5 ) Sales for stores opened throughout 2010 74 Non-store sales: Including sales of machinery, sales to independent parts stores and team member sales 8 Total increase in sales $ 550 We believe that the increased sales achieved by our stores were the result of superior inventory availability, a broader selection of products offered in most stores, a targeted promotional and advertising effort through a variety of media and localized promotional events, continued improvement in the merchandising and store layouts of the stores, compensation programs for all store Team Members that provide incentives for performance and our continued focus on serving professional service providers. The improvement in comparable store sales for the year was driven both by increased transaction counts and higher average ticket values. We believe that the increase in transaction counts was a result of the customer focus on better maintaining their current vehicles, the stabilization of the economy and gas prices during the year and the growth of our commercial business in the acquired CSK markets. The improvement in average ticket value was primarily the result of a larger percentage of our total sales derived from higher priced hard parts categories. We opened 149 net, new stores during the year ended December 31, 2010, compared to 142 net, new stores for the year ended December 31, 2009. At December 31, 2010, we operated 3,570 stores compared to 3,421 stores at December 31, 2009. Gross profit: Gross profit for the year ended December 31, 2010, increased to $2.62 billion (or 48.6% of sales) from $2.33 billion (or 48.0% of sales) for the same period one year ago, representing an increase of 13%. The increase in gross profit dollars was primarily a result of the increase in sales from new stores and the increase in comparable store sales at existing stores. The increase in gross profit as a percentage of sales was the result of improved product mix, lower product acquisition costs and decreased inventory shrinkage at converted CSK stores, partially offset by the impact of increased commercial sales as a percent of the total sales mix and reduced leverage on the expanded number of distribution centers. The improvement in product mix was primarily driven by increased sales in the hard part categories, which typically generate a higher gross margin percentage than other categories. Increasing hard part sales were the result of strong consumer demand as consumers retained their vehicles longer and our enhanced and more comprehensive inventory levels in the hard part categories in the CSK stores, supported by a more extensive and robust distribution network. Lower product acquisition costs were derived from improved negotiating leverage with our vendors as the result of large purchase volume increases associated with the acquisition of CSK. The benefit of this improvement in gross margin was realized in the first and second quarters of 2010 as compared to the same periods in 2009 when we renegotiated these vendor contracts. Our gross margin results for the third and fourth quarters of 2010 reflected comparable periods of improved purchasing leverage. The decrease in inventory shrinkage at converted CSK stores was the result of the more robust O Reilly point of sale system ( POS ), which was installed in all CSK stores when they converted to the O Reilly distribution systems. The O Reilly POS provides our store managers with better tools to track and control inventory resulting in improved inventory shrinkage. Commercial sales are growing at a faster rate than DIY sales as a result of the enhanced distribution model in our western markets, which supports the implementation of our dual market strategy in these areas. Commercial sales typically carry a lower gross margin percentage than DIY sales, as volume discounts are granted on wholesale transactions to professional customers, and create pressure on our gross margin as a percent of sales. The reduced leverage on distribution center costs was the result of the additional distribution centers, which were opened in conjunction with the CSK integration plan. New Team Members in these distribution centers were not yet fully proficient with distribution operations, resulting in inefficiencies. 31 Table of Contents Selling, general and administrative expenses: SG&A for the year ended December 31, 2010, increased to $1.89 billion (or 35.0% of sales) from $1.79 billion (or 36.9% of sales) for the same period one year ago, representing an increase of 6%. The increase in total SG&A dollars was primarily the result of additional employees, facilities and vehicles to support our increased store count and dual market strategy in the acquired CSK stores, as well as increased incentive compensation for Team Members resulting from strong comparable store sales. The decrease in SG&A as a percentage of sales was primarily attributable to increased leverage of fixed costs on very strong comparable store sales levels. Operating income: Operating income for the year ended December 31, 2010, increased to $713 million (or 13.2% of sales) from $538 million (or 11.1% of sales) for the same period one year ago, representing an increase of 33%. The increase in operating income was the result of increased sales and gross profit, offset by the increased SG&A discussed above as well as a $21 million charge related to the legacy DOJ investigation of CSK as discussed in Item 3, Legal Proceedings and Note 12 Legal Matters to the consolidated financial statements. The increase in operating income as a percentage of sales was the result of our improvements in gross margin and significant leverage on fixed SG&A costs from strong comparable store sales. Other income and expense: Interest expense for the year ended December 31, 2010, decreased to $39 million (or 0.7% of sales) from $45 million (or 0.9% of sales) for the same period one year ago, representing a decrease of 13%. The decrease in interest expense during 2010 as compared to 2009 was the result of a lower level of average outstanding borrowings under our ABL Credit Facility. Included as a component of Other income for the year ended December 31, 2010, was a nonrecurring, non-operating gain of $12 million related to the favorable settlement of a note receivable acquired in the acquisition of CSK. Income taxes: Our provision for income taxes for the year ended December 31, 2010, increased to $270 million (39.2% effective tax rate) from $189 million (38.1% effective tax rate) for the same period one year ago, representing an increase of 43%. The increase in our provision for income taxes was due to the increase in our taxable income. The increase in the effective rate was primarily the result of the charge related to the CSK DOJ investigation of $21 million which was not deductible for tax purposes. Net income: As a result of the impacts discussed above, net income for the year ended December 31, 2010, increased to $419 million (or 7.8% of sales) from $307 million (or 6.3% of sales) for the same period one year ago, representing an increase of 36%. Earnings per share: Our diluted earnings per common share for the year ended December 31, 2010, increased 32% to $2.95 on 142 million shares from $2.23 on 138 million shares for the same period one year ago. Adjustments for nonrecurring and non-operating events: Our results for the year ended December 31, 2010, included charges related to the nonrecurring, non-operating gain related to the settlement of a note receivable acquired from CSK discussed above, as well as the charges related to the legacy CSK DOJ investigation discussed above. Adjusted operating income increased 37% to $734 million (13.6% of sales) for the year ended December 31, 2010, from $538 million (11.1% of sales), for the same period one year ago. Adjusted net income increased 41% to $433 million (8.0% of sales) for the year ended December 31, 2010, from $307 million (6.3% of sales), for the same period one year ago. Adjusted diluted earnings per common share increased 37% to $3.05 for the year ended December 31, 2010, from $2.23 for the same period one year ago. The table below outlines the impact of the charges related to the legacy CSK DOJ investigation and the gain on the settlement of the note receivable for the years ended December 31, 2010 and 2009 (amounts in thousands, except per share data): For the Year Ended December 31, 2010 2009 Amount % of Sales Amount % of Sales GAAP Operating income $ 712,776 13.2 % $ 537,619 11.1 % Legacy CSK DOJ investigation charge 20,900 0.4 % % Non-GAAP adjusted operating income $ 733,676 13.6 % $ 537,619 11.1 % GAAP net income $ 419,373 7.8 % $ 307,498 6.3 % Legacy CSK DOJ investigation charge 20,900 0.4 % % Gain on settlement of note receivable, net of tax (7,215 ) (0.2 )% % Non-GAAP adjusted net income $ 433,058 8.0 % $ 307,498 6.3 % GAAP diluted earnings per common share $ 2.95 $ 2.23 Legacy CSK DOJ investigation charge 0.15 Gain on settlement of note receivable, net of tax (0.05 ) Non-GAAP adjusted diluted earnings per common share $ 3.05 $ 2.23 Weighted-average common shares outstanding - assuming dilution 141,992 137,882 The financial information presented in the paragraph and table above is not derived in accordance with GAAP. We do not, nor do we suggest investors should, consider such non-GAAP financial measures in isolation from, or as a substitute for, GAAP financial information. We believe that the presentation of financial results and estimates excluding the impact of the charges for the legacy CSK DOJ investigation and the nonrecurring, non-operating gain related to the settlement of a note receivable acquired in the 32 Table of Contents acquisition of CSK provide meaningful supplemental information to both management and investors, which is indicative of our core operations. We exclude these items in judging our performance and believe this non-GAAP information is useful to investors as well. Material limitations of these non-GAAP measures are that such measures do not reflect actual GAAP amounts. We compensate for such limitations by presenting, in the table above, the accompanying reconciliation to the most directly comparable GAAP measures. LIQUIDITY AND CAPITAL RESOURCES Our long-term business strategy requires capital to open new stores, fund strategic acquisitions, expand distribution infrastructure, operate and maintain existing stores and may include the opportunistic repurchase of shares of our common stock through our Board-approved share repurchase program. The primary sources of our liquidity are funds generated from operations and borrowed under our Revolving Credit Facility. Decreased demand for our products or changes in customer buying patterns could negatively impact our ability to generate funds from operations. Additionally, decreased demand or changes in buying patterns could impact our ability to meet the debt covenants of our credit agreement and, therefore, negatively impact the funds available under our Revolving Credit Facility. We believe that cash expected to be provided by operating activities and availability under our Revolving Credit Facility will be sufficient to fund both our short-term and long-term capital and liquidity needs for the foreseeable future. However, there can be no assurance that we will continue to generate cash flows at or above recent levels. Liquidity and related ratios: The following table highlights our liquidity and related ratios as of December 31, 2011 and 2010 (dollars in millions): December 31, December 31, Percentage Liquidity and Related Ratios 2011 2010 Change Current assets $ 2,608 $ 2,301 13 % Quick assets (1) 565 213 165 % Current liabilities 1,580 1,229 29 % Working capital (2) 1,028 1,072 (4 )% Total debt 798 359 122 % Total equity 2,845 3,210 (11 )% Current ratio (3) 1.65:1 1.87:1 (12 )% Quick ratio (4) 0.39:1 0.23:1 70 % Debt to equity (5) 0.28:1 0.11:1 155 % (1) Quick assets include cash, cash equivalents and receivables. (2) Working capital is calculated as current assets less current liabilities. (3) Current ratio is calculated as current assets divided by current liabilities. (4) Quick ratio is calculated as current assets, less inventories, divided by current liabilities. (5) Debt to equity is calculated as total debt divided by shareholders equity. Total debt increased 122% and total equity decreased 11% from 2010 to 2011. The increase in total debt was attributable the issuance of our senior notes during 2011, partially offset by the repayment of our ABL Credit Facility in January of 2011. The decrease in total equity resulted from the impact of repurchase activity under our share repurchase program on additional paid-in capital and retained earnings, offset by an increase in retained earnings from strong net income for the year and an increase in additional paid-in-capital from the proceeds of stock option exercises, and related excess tax benefits, executed under our director and employee share-based compensation plans. The following table identifies cash provided by/(used in) our operating, investing and financing activities for the years ended December 30, 2011, 2010 and 2009 (in thousands): Year Ended Liquidity December 31, 2011 December 31, 2010 December 31, 2009 Total cash provided by/(used in): Operating activities $ 1,118,991 $ 703,687 $ 285,200 Investing activities (319,653 ) (351,277 ) (410,661 ) Financing activities (467,507 ) (349,624 ) 121,095 Increase (decrease) in cash and cash equivalents $ 331,831 $ 2,786 $ (4,366 ) Operating activities: The increase in cash provided by operating activities in 2011 compared to 2010 is primarily due to strong net income for the year (adjusted for the effect of non-cash depreciation and amortization charges, the one-time, non-cash charge to write off the balance of debt issuance costs in conjunction with the retirement of our ABL Credit Facility in January of 2011 and deferred income taxes) and a significant decrease in net inventory investment, partially offset by a decrease in other current liabilities (driven by the payment of the one-time penalty to the DOJ for the legacy CSK DOJ investigation). Net inventory investment reflects our investment in inventory, 33 Table of Contents net of the amount of accounts payable to vendors. Our net inventory investment significantly decreased as a result of the impact of our enhanced vendor financing programs as well as our ongoing efforts to remove excess inventory from our systems. Our vendor financing programs enable us to reduce overall supply chain costs and negotiate extended payment terms with our vendors. Our accounts payable to inventory ratio was 64.4% and 44.3% at December 31, 2011 and 2010, respectively. Our efforts to remove excess inventory from our systems resulted in a decrease in total inventory of $37 million during the year, despite the fact that we opened 170 new stores during the year. The increase in cash provided by operating activities in 2010 compared to 2009 was primarily due to an increase in net income (adjusted for the effect of non-cash depreciation and amortization charges and deferred income taxes), a significant decrease in net inventory investment and an increase in other liabilities as compared to the same period in 2009. The decrease in net inventory investment in 2010 as compared to 2009 was the result of the significant investments in 2009 to improve the inventory availability in the acquired CSK stores. The increase in other liabilities was principally due to the accrual of the CSK DOJ investigation charge during 2010, which was paid in 2011. Investing activities: The decrease in cash used in investing activities in 2011 compared to 2010 is primarily the result of decreased capital expenditures. Total capital expenditures were $328 million in 2011, $365 million in 2010 and $415 million in 2009. During 2010, we completed the comprehensive expansion of our distribution system in the CSK markets and the conversion of the CSK stores to the O Reilly POS, resulting in reduced levels of conversion related capital expenditures during 2011. The decrease in cash used in investing activities in 2010 compared to 2009 was principally due to a decrease in capital expenditures associated with the integration of CSK and an increase in payments received on notes receivable. Capital expenditures related to the acquisition of CSK included the purchase of properties for distribution centers ( DC s) and costs associated with the conversion of CSK stores to the O Reilly Brand. Although we opened four new DCs in 2010, a significant portion of the capital expenditures for these DCs occurred in 2009 as we acquired property and began construction of the facilities. The increase in payments received on notes receivable was due to the one-time nonrecurring payment received to settle a note receivable acquired in the CSK acquisition. We opened 170 net, new stores in 2011, 149 net, new stores in 2010 and 150 net, new stores in 2009. We plan to open 180 net, new stores in 2012. The costs associated with the opening of a new store (including the cost of land acquisition, improvements, fixtures, vehicles, net inventory investment and computer equipment) are estimated to average approximately $1.3 million to $1.5 million; however, such costs may be significantly reduced where we lease, rather than purchase, the store site. Financing activities: The increase in net cash used in financing activities during 2011 compared to 2010 is primarily attributable to the impact of repurchases of our common stock during 2011 in accordance with our Board-approved share repurchase program, which was partially offset by an increase in net long term borrowings in 2011 as compared to net repayments under our facilities during 2010. The net borrowings in 2011 are the result of proceeds from the issuance of our 4.875% Senior Notes due 2021 and our 4.625% Senior Notes due 2021 in January and September of 2011, respectively, partially offset by the repayment and termination of our previous ABL Credit Facility and the payment of debt issuance costs related to the issuance of our senior notes and the establishment of our new unsecured Revolving Credit Facility. The net repayments under our facilities in 2010 were the result of our focus on using available cash on hand to reduce the level of outstanding borrowings under our secured ABL Credit Facility. Net cash used in financing activities in 2010 compared to net cash provided by financing activities in 2009 is driven by the increase in net repayments of outstanding borrowings on our long-term debt. Credit facilities: On July 11, 2008, we entered into a credit agreement for a five-year asset-based revolving credit facility, which was scheduled to mature in July of 2013. At December 31, 2010, we had outstanding borrowings of $356 million under the ABL Credit Facility, of which $106 million were not covered under an interest rate swap contract. All outstanding borrowings under the ABL Credit Facility were repaid, and all related interest rate swap transaction contracts were terminated on January 14, 2011, and the ABL Credit Facility was retired concurrent with the issuance of our 4.875% Senior Notes due 2021, as further described below. In conjunction with the retirement of our ABL Credit Facility, we recognized a one-time non-cash charge to write off the balance of debt issuance costs related to the ABL Credit Facility in the amount of $22 million and a one-time charge related to the termination of our interest rate swap contracts in the amount of $4 million, which are included in Other income (expense) on the accompanying Consolidated Statements of Income for the year ended December 31, 2011. On January 14, 2011, we entered into a new credit agreement for a five-year $750 million unsecured Revolving Credit Facility arranged by BA and Barclays Capital, which was scheduled to mature in January of 2016. During 2011, we amended the unsecured Revolving Credit Facility, which decreased the facility to $660 million and reduced the fees and interest rate margins for borrowings under the Revolving Credit Facility. The amendment also extended the maturity of the Revolving Credit Facility to September of 2016. In conjunction with the amendment to the Revolving Credit Facility, we recognized a one-time charge related to the modification to the credit facility in the amount of $0.3 million, which is included in Other income (expense) on the accompanying Consolidated Statements of Income for the year ended December 31, 2011. The Revolving Credit Facility includes a $200 million sub-limit for the issuance of letters of credit and a $75 million sub-limit for swing line borrowings. As described in the credit agreement governing the Revolving Credit Facility, we may, from time to time subject to certain conditions, increase the aggregate commitments under the Revolving Credit Facility by up to $200 million. As of December 31, 2011, we had stand-by letters of credit, primarily to satisfy workers compensation, general liability and other insurance policies, in the amount of $60 million. As of December 31, 2011, we had no outstanding borrowings under the Revolving Credit Facility. 34 Table of Contents Senior Notes: 4.875% Senior Notes due 2021: On January 14, 2011, we issued $500 million aggregate principal amount of unsecured 4.875% Senior Notes due 2021 ( 4.875% Senior Notes due 2021 ) at a price to the public of 99.297% of their face value with United Missouri Bank, N.A. ( UMB ) as trustee. Interest on the 4.875% Senior Notes due 2021 is payable on January 14 and July 14 of each year, which began on July 14, 2011, and is computed on the basis of a 360-day year. The net proceeds from the issuance of the 4.875% Senior Notes due 2021 were used to repay all of the outstanding borrowings under our ABL Credit Facility and to pay fees and expenses related to the offering and costs associated with terminating our existing interest rate swap contracts, with the remainder used for general corporate purposes. 4.625% Senior Notes due 2021: On September 19, 2011, we issued $300 million aggregate principal amount of unsecured 4.625% Senior Notes due 2021 ( 4.625% Senior Notes due 2021 ) at a price to the public of 99.826% of their face value with UMB as trustee. Interest on the 4.625% Senior Notes due 2021 is payable on March 15 and September 15 of each year beginning on March 15, 2012, and is computed on the basis of a 360-day year. The net proceeds from the issuance of the 4.625% Senior Notes due 2021 were used to pay fees and expenses related to the offering, with the remainder intended to be used to repay borrowings outstanding from time to time under the Revolving Credit Facility and for general corporate purposes, including share repurchases. The senior notes are guaranteed on a senior unsecured basis by each of our subsidiaries ( Subsidiary Guarantors ) that incurs or guarantees our obligations under our Revolving Credit Facility or certain of our other debt or any of our Subsidiary Guarantors. The guarantees are full and unconditional and joint and several. Each of the Subsidiary Guarantors is wholly-owned, directly or indirectly, by us and we have no independent assets or operations other than those of our subsidiaries. Our only direct or indirect subsidiaries that would not be Subsidiary Guarantors would be minor subsidiaries. No minor subsidiaries exist today. Neither we, nor any of our Subsidiary Guarantors, are subject to any material or significant restrictions on our ability to obtain funds from our subsidiaries by dividend or loan or to transfer assets from such subsidiaries, except as provided by applicable law. Each of our senior notes is subject to certain customary covenants, with which we complied as of December 31, 2011. Debt covenants: The indentures governing our senior notes contain covenants that limit our ability and the ability of certain of our subsidiaries to, among other things: (i) create certain liens on assets to secure certain debt; (ii) enter into certain sale and leaseback transactions; and (iii) merge or consolidate with another company or transfer all or substantially all of our or its property, in each case as set forth in the indentures. These covenants are, however, subject to a number of important limitations and exceptions. The Credit Agreement contains covenants, including limitations on total outstanding borrowings under the Revolving Credit Facility, a minimum consolidated fixed charge coverage ratio of 2.0 times through December 31, 2012; 2.25 times through December 31, 2014; 2.5 times through maturity; and a maximum adjusted consolidated leverage ratio of 3.0 times through maturity. The consolidated leverage ratio includes a calculation of adjusted earnings before interest, taxes, depreciation, amortization, rent and stock option compensation expense ( EBITDAR ) to adjusted debt. Adjusted debt includes outstanding debt, outstanding stand-by letters of credit, six-times rent expense and excludes any premium or discount recorded in conjunction with the issuance of long-term debt. In the event that we should default on any covenant contained within the Credit Agreement, certain actions may be taken against us, including but not limited to possible termination of credit extensions, immediate payment of outstanding principal amount plus accrued interest and litigation from our lenders. We had a fixed charge coverage ratio of 4.86 times and 4.21 times as of December 31, 2011 and 2010, respectively, and an adjusted debt to adjusted EBITDAR ratio of 1.75 times and 1.57 times as of December 31, 2011 and 2010, respectively, remaining in compliance with all covenants related to the borrowing arrangements. Under our current financing policy, we have targeted an adjusted consolidated leverage ratio range of 2.0 times to 2.25 times. 35 Table of Contents The table below outlines the calculations of the fixed charge coverage ratio and adjusted debt to adjusted EBITDAR ratio covenants, as defined in the Credit Agreement governing the Revolving Credit Facility, for the twelve months ended December 31, 2011 and 2010 (dollars in thousands): Year Ended Year Ended December 31, 2011 December 31, 2010 GAAP net income $ 507,673 $ 419,373 Add: Interest expense 28,165 39,273 Rent expense 230,897 226,879 Provision for income taxes 308,100 270,000 Depreciation expense 164,579 154,812 Amortization expense 1,301 6,630 Non-cash share based compensation 20,579 14,947 Gain on settlement of note receivable (11,639 ) Write-off of asset-based revolving credit facility debt issuance costs 21,626 Legacy CSK DOJ investigation charge 20,900 Non-GAAP adjusted net income (EBITDAR) $ 1,282,920 $ 1,141,175 Interest expense $ 28,165 $ 39,273 Capitalized interest 4,666 5,133 Rent expense 230,897 226,879 Total fixed charges $ 263,728 $ 271,285 Fixed charge coverage ratio 4.86 4.21 GAAP debt $ 797,574 $ 358,704 Stand-by letters of credit 59,917 71,206 Discount on senior notes 3,683 Six-times rent expense 1,385,382 1,361,274 Non-GAAP adjusted debt $ 2,246,556 $ 1,791,184 Adjusted debt to adjusted EBITDAR ratio 1.75 1.57 The fixed charge coverage ratio and adjusted debt to adjusted EBITDAR ratio discussed and presented in the table above are not derived in accordance with U.S. GAAP. We do not, nor do we suggest investors should, consider such non-GAAP financial measures in isolation from, or as a substitute for, GAAP financial information. We believe that the presentation of our fixed charge coverage ratio and adjusted debt to adjusted EBITDAR provides meaningful supplemental information to both management and investors that reflects the required covenants under our credit agreement. We include these items in judging our performance and believe this non-GAAP information is useful to investors as well. Material limitations of these non-GAAP measures are that such measures do not reflect actual GAAP amounts. We compensate for such limitations by presenting, in the table above, the accompanying reconciliation to the most directly comparable GAAP measures. OFF-BALANCE SHEET ARRANGEMENTS Off-balance sheet arrangements are transactions, agreements, or other contractual arrangements with an unconsolidated entity for which we have an obligation to the entity that is not recorded in our consolidated financial statements. We have utilized various off balance sheet financial instruments from time to time as sources of cash when such instruments provided a cost-effective alternative to our existing sources of cash. We do not believe, however, that we are dependent on the availability of these instruments to fund our working capital requirements or our growth plans. On December 29, 2000, we entered into a sale-leaseback transaction with an unrelated party. Under the terms of the transaction, we sold 90 properties, including land, buildings and improvements, which generated $52 million of cash. The lease, which is being accounted for as an operating lease, provides for an initial lease term of 21 years and may be extended for one initial ten-year period and two additional successive periods of five years each. The resulting gain of $5 million has been deferred and is being amortized over the initial lease term. Net rent expense during the initial term is approximately $5 million annually. In August 2001, we entered into a sale-leaseback with O Reilly-Wooten, 2001 LLP (an entity owned by certain of our affiliates). The transaction involved the sale and leaseback of nine O Reilly Auto Parts stores and generated approximately $6 million of cash. The transaction did not result in a material gain or loss. The lease, which has been accounted for as an operating lease, calls for an initial term of 15 years with three five-year renewal options. We issue stand-by letters of credit provided by a $200 million sub limit under the Revolving Credit Facility that reduce our available borrowings under the Revolving Credit Facility. Those letters of credit are issued primarily to satisfy the requirements of workers compensation, general liability and other insurance policies. Substantially all of the outstanding letters of credit have a one-year term from the date of issuance. Letters of credit totaling $60 million and $71 million were outstanding at December 31, 2011 and 2010, respectively. 36 Table of Contents CONTRACTUAL OBLIGATIONS Our contractual obligations as of December 31, 2011, included commitments for short and long-term debt arrangements, interest payments related to long-term debt, future payments under non-cancelable lease arrangements, self-insurance reserves and purchase obligations for construction contract commitments, which are identified in the table below and are fully disclosed in Note 5 Long-Term Debt and Note 11 Commitments to the Consolidated Financial Statements. We expect to fund these commitments primarily with operating cash flows generated in the normal course of business or through borrowings under our Revolving Credit Facility. Deferred income taxes and commitments with various vendors for the purchase of inventory are included in Other liabilities on our Consolidated Balance Sheets but are not reflected in the table below due to the absence of scheduled maturities, the nature of the account or the commitment cancellation terms. Due to the absence of scheduled maturities, the timing of certain of these payments cannot be determined, except for amounts estimated to be payable in 2012, which are included in Current liabilities on our Consolidated Balance Sheets. Payments Due By Period Total Before 1 Year 1 to 2 Years 3 to 4 Years Years 5 and Over (In thousands) Contractual Obligations: Long-term debt principal and interest payments (1) $ 797,727 $ 737 $ 477 $ 177 $ 796,336 Future minimum lease payments under capital leases (2) 256 77 154 25 Future minimum lease payments under operating leases (2) 1,650,698 226,381 400,661 297,947 725,709 Other obligations 3,000 600 1,200 1,200 Self-insurance reserves (3) 116,096 53,155 32,009 15,736 15,196 Construction commitments 41,616 41,616 Total contractual cash obligations $ 2,609,393 $ 322,566 $ 434,501 $ 315,085 $ 1,537,241 (1) On January 14, 2011, we entered into a new credit agreement for a five-year $750 million Revolving Credit Facility, which matures in January of 2016. On September 9, 2011, we amended the Credit Agreement, decreasing the aggregate commitments under the Revolving Credit Facility to $660 million, extending the maturity date on the Credit Agreement to September of 2016 and reducing the facility fee and interest rate margins for borrowings under the Revolving Credit Facility. Borrowings under the Revolving Credit Facility (other than swing line loans) bear interest, at our option, at either the Base Rate or Eurodollar Rate (both as defined in the agreement) plus a margin, that will vary from 0.975% to 1.600% in the case of loans bearing interest at the Eurodollar Rate and 0.000% to 0.600% in the case of loans bearing interest at the Base Rate, in each case based upon the better of the ratings assigned to our debt by Moody Investor Service, Inc. and Standard & Poor Rating Services. Swing line loans made under the Revolving Credit Facility bear interest at the Base Rate plus the applicable margin described above. In addition, we pay a facility fee on the aggregate amount of the commitments in an amount equal to a percentage of such commitments, varying from 0.150% to 0.400% based upon the better of the ratings assigned to our debt by Moody Investor Service, Inc. and Standard & Poor Rating Services. Based on our current credit ratings, our margin for Base Rate loans is 0.200%, our margin for Eurodollar Rate loans is 1.200% and our facility fee is 0.175%. (2) The minimum lease payments above do not include certain tax, insurance and maintenance costs, which are also required contractual obligations under our operating leases but are generally not fixed and can fluctuate from year to year. These expenses historically average approximately 20% of the corresponding lease payments. (3) We use various self-insurance mechanisms to provide for potential liabilities from workers compensation, vehicle and general liability, and employee health care benefits. These liabilities are recorded on our Consolidated Balance Sheets at our estimate of their net present value and do not have scheduled maturities, however we can estimate the timing of future payments based upon historical patterns. We record a reserve for potential liabilities related to uncertain tax positions, including estimated interest and penalties, which are fully disclosed in Note 14 Income Taxes to the Consolidated Financial Statements. These estimates are not included in the above table because the timing related to the ultimate resolution or settlement of these positions cannot be determined. As of December 31, 2011, we recorded a liability of $53 million related to these uncertain tax positions on our Consolidated Balance Sheets, all of which was included as a component of Other liabilities . CRITICAL ACCOUNTING ESTIMATES The preparation of our financial statements in accordance with GAAP requires the application of certain estimates and judgments by management. Management bases its assumptions, estimates, and adjustments on historical experience, current trends and other factors believed to be relevant at the time the consolidated financial statements are prepared. Management believes that the following policies are critical due to the inherent uncertainty of these matters and the complex and subjective judgments required to establish these estimates. Management continues to review these critical accounting policies and estimates to ensure that the consolidated financial statements are presented fairly in accordance with GAAP. However, actual results could differ from our assumptions and estimates and such differences could be material. 37 Table of Contents Inventory Obsolescence and Shrink Inventory, which consists of automotive hard parts, maintenance items, accessories and tools, is stated at the lower of cost or market. The extended nature of the life cycle of our products is such that the risk of obsolescence of our inventory is minimal. The products that we sell generally have applications in our markets for a relatively long period of time in conjunction with the corresponding vehicle population. We have developed sophisticated systems for monitoring the life cycle of a given product and, accordingly, have historically been very successful in adjusting the volume of our inventory in conjunction with a decrease in demand. We do record a reserve to reduce the carrying value of our inventory through a charge to cost of sales in the isolated instances where we believe that the market value of a product line is lower than our recorded cost. This reserve is based on our assumptions about the marketability of our existing inventory and is subject to uncertainty to the extent that we must estimate, at a given point in time, the market value of inventory that will be sold in future periods. Ultimately, our projections could differ from actual results and could result in a material impact to our stated inventory balances. We have historically not had to materially adjust our obsolescence reserves due to the factors discussed above and do not anticipate that we will experience material changes in our estimates in the future. We also record a reserve to reduce the carrying value of our perpetual inventory to account for quantities in our perpetual records above the actual existing quantities on hand caused by unrecorded shrink. We estimate this reserve based on the results of our extensive and frequent cycle counting programs and periodic, full physical inventories at our stores and DCs. To the extent that our estimates do not accurately reflect the actual unrecorded inventory shrinkage, we could potentially experience a material impact to our inventory balances. We have historically been able to provide a timely and accurate measurement of shrink and have not experienced material adjustments to our estimates. If unrecorded shrink changed 10% from the estimate that we recorded based on our historical experience at December 31, 2011, the financial impact would have been approximately $1 million or 0.1% of pretax income for the year ended December 31, 2011. Accounts Receivable We provide credit to our commercial customers in the ordinary course of business. We estimate the allowance for doubtful accounts on these receivables based on historical loss ratios and other relevant factors. Actual results have consistently been within management expectations, and we do not believe there is a reasonable likelihood that there will be a material change in the future that will require a significant change in the assumptions or estimates we use to calculate our allowance for doubtful accounts. However, if actual results differ from our estimates, we may be exposed to losses or gains. If the allowance for doubtful accounts were changed 10% from our estimated allowance at December 31, 2011, the financial impact would have been approximately $1 million or 0.1% of pretax income for the year ended December 31, 2011. Valuation of Long-Lived Assets and Goodwill - We evaluate the carrying value of long-lived assets for impairment whenever events or changes in circumstances indicate the carrying value of these assets might exceed their current fair values. As part of the evaluation, we review performance at the store level to identify any stores with current period operating losses that should be considered for impairment. A potential impairment has occurred if the projected future undiscounted cash flows realized from the best possible use of the asset are less than the carrying value of the asset. The estimate of cash flows includes management assumptions of cash inflows and outflows directly resulting from the use of that asset in operations. If the carrying amount of an asset exceeds its estimated future cash flows, an impairment charge is recognized for the amount by which the carrying amount of the asset exceeds the fair value of the assets. Our impairment analyses contain estimates due to the inherently judgmental nature of forecasting long-term estimated cash flows and determining the ultimate useful lives and fair values of the assets. Actual results could differ from these estimates, which could materially impact our impairment assessment. We review goodwill for impairment annually on November 30, or when events or changes in circumstances indicate the carrying value of these assets might exceed their current fair values. We have not historically recorded an impairment to goodwill. The process of evaluating goodwill for impairment involves the determination of the fair value of our Company using the market approach. Inherent in such fair value determinations are certain judgments and estimates, including estimates which incorporate assumptions marketplace participants would use in making their estimates of fair value. In the future, if events or market conditions affect the estimated fair value to the extent that an asset is impaired, we will adjust the carrying value of these assets in the period in which the impairment occurs, however, we do not believe there has been any change of events or circumstances that would indicate that a reevaluation of goodwill is required as of December 31, 2011, nor do we believe goodwill is at risk of failing impairment testing. If the price of O Reilly stock, which was a primary input used to determine our market capitalization during step one of goodwill impairment testing, changed by 10% from the value used during testing, the results and our conclusions would not have changed and no further steps would have been required. Vendor concessions We receive concessions from our vendors through a variety of programs and arrangements, including co-operative advertising, allowances for warranties, merchandise allowances and volume purchase rebates. Co-operative advertising allowances that are incremental to our advertising program, specific to a product or event and identifiable for accounting purposes, are reported as a reduction of advertising expense in the period in which the advertising occurred. All other material vendor concessions are recognized as a reduction to the cost of inventory. Amounts receivable from vendors also include amounts due to us relating to vendor purchases and product returns. Management regularly reviews amounts receivable from 38 Table of Contents vendors and assesses the need for a reserve for uncollectible amounts based on our evaluation of our vendors financial position and corresponding ability to meet their financial obligations. Based on our historical results and current assessment, we have not recorded a reserve for uncollectible amounts in our consolidated financial statements, and we do not believe there is a reasonable likelihood that our ability to collect these amounts will differ from our expectations. The eventual ability of our vendors to pay us the obliged amounts could differ from our assumptions and estimates, and we may be exposed to losses or gains that could be material. Self-Insurance Reserves We use a combination of insurance and self-insurance mechanisms to provide for potential liabilities from workers compensation, general liability, vehicle liability, property loss, and Team Member health care benefits. With the exception of certain Team Member health care benefit liabilities, we obtain third-party insurance coverage to limit our exposure for any individual workers compensation, general liability, vehicle liability or property loss claim. When estimating our self-insurance liabilities, we consider a number of factors, including historical claims experience and trend-lines, projected medical and legal inflation, and growth patterns and exposure forecasts. The assumptions made by management as they relate to each of these factors represent our judgment as to the most probable cumulative impact of each factor to our future obligations. Our calculation of self-insurance liabilities requires management to apply judgment to estimate the ultimate cost to settle reported claims and claims incurred but not yet reported as of the balance sheet date and the application of alternative assumptions could result in a different estimate of these liabilities. Actual claim activity or development may vary from our assumptions and estimates, which may result in material losses or gains. As we obtain additional information that affects the assumptions and estimates we used to recognize liabilities for claims incurred in prior accounting periods, we adjust our self-insurance liabilities to reflect the revised estimates based on this additional information. These liabilities are recorded at our estimate of their net present value. These liabilities do not have scheduled maturities, but we can estimate the timing of future payments based upon historical patterns. We could apply alternative assumptions regarding the timing of payments or the applicable discount rate that could result in materially different estimates of the net present value of the liabilities. If self-insurance reserves were changed 10% from our estimated reserves at December 31, 2011, the financial impact would have been approximately $11 million or 1.3% of pretax income for the year ended December 31, 2011. Closed Property Reserves We maintain reserves for closed stores and other properties that are no longer utilized in current operations. We accrue for closed property operating lease liabilities using a credit-adjusted discount rate to calculate the present value of the remaining non-cancelable lease payments, contractual occupancy costs and lease termination fees after the closing date, net of estimated sublease income. The closed property lease liabilities are expected to be paid over the remaining lease terms. We estimate sublease income and future cash flows based on our experience and knowledge of the market in which the closed property is located, our previous efforts to dispose of similar assets and existing economic conditions. Adjustments to closed property reserves are made to reflect changes in estimated sublease income or actual exit costs from original estimates. Adjustments are made for changes in estimates in the period in which the changes become known. If closed property reserves were changed 10% from our estimated reserves at December 31, 2011, the financial impact would have been approximately $1 million or 0.2% of pretax income for the year ended December 31, 2011. Legal Reserves We maintain reserves for expenses associated with litigation for which O Reilly is currently involved. We are currently involved in litigation incidental to the ordinary conduct of our business as well as resolving the governmental investigations and litigation that are being conducted against certain of CSK former employees for alleged conduct relating to periods prior to the acquisition date. As a result of the acquisition, we expect to continue to incur ongoing legal fees related to such investigations, litigation and indemnity obligations. Our legal reserve was principally recorded as an assumed liability in our allocation of the purchase price of CSK. Management, with the assistance of outside legal counsel, must make estimates of potential legal obligations and possible liabilities arising from such litigation and records reserves for these expenditures. If legal reserves were changed 10% from our estimated reserves at December 31, 2011, the financial impact would have been approximately $2 million or 0.2% of pretax income for the year ended December 31, 2011. Taxes We operate within multiple taxing jurisdictions and are subject to audit in these jurisdictions. These audits can involve complex issues, which may require an extended period of time to resolve. We regularly review our potential tax liabilities for tax years subject to audit. The amount of such liabilities is based on various factors, such as differing interpretations of tax regulations by the responsible tax authority, experience with previous tax audits and applicable tax law rulings. Changes in our tax liability may occur in the future as our assessments change based on the progress of tax examinations in various jurisdictions and/or changes in tax regulations. In management opinion, adequate provisions for income taxes have been made for all years presented. The estimates of our potential tax liabilities contain uncertainties because management must use judgment to estimate the exposures associated with our various tax positions and actual results could differ from our estimates. Alternatively, we could have applied assumptions regarding the eventual outcome of the resolution of open tax positions that could differ from our current estimates but that would still be reasonable given the nature of a particular position. While our estimates are subject to the uncertainty noted in the preceding discussion, our initial estimates of our potential tax liabilities have historically not been materially different from actual results except in instances where we have reversed liabilities that were recorded for periods that were subsequently closed with the applicable taxing authority. 39 Table of Contents INFLATION AND SEASONALITY For the last three fiscal years, we have been successful, in many cases, in reducing the effects of merchandise cost increases principally by taking advantage of vendor incentive programs, economies of scale resulting from increased volume of purchases and selective forward buying. To the extent our acquisition cost increased due to base commodity price increases industry-wide, we have typically been able to pass along these increased costs through higher retail prices for the affected products. As a result, we do not believe our operations have been materially, adversely affected by inflation. To some extent, our business is seasonal primarily as a result of the impact of weather conditions on customer buying patterns. While we have historically realized operating profits in each quarter of the year, our store sales and profits have historically been higher in the second and third quarters (April through September) than in the first and fourth quarters (October through March) of the year. QUARTERLY RESULTS The following table sets forth certain quarterly unaudited operating data for fiscal 2011 and 2010. The unaudited quarterly information includes all adjustments which management considers necessary for a fair presentation of the information shown. The unaudited operating data presented below should be read in conjunction with our consolidated financial statements and related notes included elsewhere in this annual report, and the other financial information included therein.

ASU 2010-06 amends Subtopic 820-10, requiring additional disclosures regarding fair value measurements such as transfers in and out of Levels 1 and 2, as well as separate disclosures about activity relating to Level 3 measurements. ASU 2010-06 clarifies existing disclosure requirements related to the level of disaggregation and input valuation techniques. The updated guidance was effective for interim and annual periods beginning after December 15, 2009, with the exception of the new Level 3 activity disclosures, which were effective for interim and annual periods beginning after December 15, 2010. The application of this guidance affected disclosures only and therefore, did not have an impact on our consolidated financial condition, results of operations or cash flows. In May of 2011, the FASB issued ASU No. 2011-04, Amendments to Achieve Common Fair Value Measurement and Disclosure Requirements in U.S. GAAP and International Financial Reporting Standards ( 2011-04 ). ASU 2011-04 was issued to bring the definition of fair value, the guidance for fair value measurement and the disclosure requirements under U.S. GAAP and International Financial Reporting Standards ( IFRS ) in line with one another. ASU 2011-04 also enhanced the disclosure requirements for changes and transfers within the valuation hierarchy levels, particularly valuations in Level 3 fair value measurements, and was effective for periods beginning after December 15, 2011. The application of this guidance affects disclosures only and therefore, should not have an impact on our consolidated financial condition, results of operations or cash flows. 40 Table of Contents In June of 2011, the FASB issued ASU No. 2011-05, Presentation of Comprehensive Income ( 2011-05 ). ASU 2011-05 was issued to improve the comparability of financial reporting between U.S. GAAP and IFRS, and eliminates previous U.S. GAAP guidance that allowed an entity to present components of other comprehensive income ( OCI ) as part of its statement of changes in shareholders equity. With the issuance of ASU 2011-05, companies are now required to report all components of OCI either in a single continuous statement of total comprehensive income, which includes components of both OCI and net income, or in a separate statement appearing consecutively with the statement of income. ASU 2011-05 does not affect current guidance for the accounting of the components of OCI, or which items are included within total comprehensive income. In December of 2011, the FASB issued ASU No. 2011-12 Deferral of the Effective Date for Amendments to the Presentation of Reclassifications of Items Out of Accumulated Other Comprehensive Income in Accounting Standards Update No. 2011-05 ( 2011-12 ). ASU 2011-12 defers changes in ASU 2011-05 that relate to the presentation of reclassification adjustments shown on the face of the financial statements. No other requirements of ASU 2011-05 were affected by the issuance of ASU 2011-12, including the requirement to report income either in a single continuous financial statement or in a separate statement of total comprehensive income, which is effective for periods beginning after December 15, 2011, with early adoption permitted. We adopted this guidance with our 2011 financial statements; the application of this guidance affects presentation only and therefore, did not have an impact on our consolidated financial condition, results of operations or cash flows. In September of 2011, the FASB issued ASU No. 2011-08 Testing Goodwill for Impairment ( 2011-08 ). ASU 2011-08 was issued to simplify the impairment test of goodwill, by allowing entities to use a qualitative approach to determine whether goodwill impairment might exist, before completing the entire impairment test. Under ASU 2011-08, an entity has the option to first assess any qualitative factors that would lead to a determination that it is more likely than not that the fair value of a reporting unit is less than its carrying amount. The changes under ASU 2011-08 are effective for public companies for annual and interim testing performed for periods beginning after December 15, 2011, with early adoption permitted. The application of this guidance is not expected to have a material impact on our consolidated financial condition, results of operations or cash flows.
