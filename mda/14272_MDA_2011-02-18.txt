Item 7. MANAGEMENT S DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS OF FINANCIAL CONDITION AND RESULTS OF OPERATIONS. EXECUTIVE SUMMARY Bristol-Myers Squibb Company (which may be referred to as Bristol-Myers Squibb, BMS, the Company, we, our or us) is a global biopharmaceutical company, consisting of global pharmaceutical/biotechnology and international consumer medicines businesses, whose mission is to discover, develop and deliver innovative medicines that help patients prevail over serious diseases. We license, manufacture, market, distribute and sell pharmaceutical products. We continued to execute our string-of-pearls strategy with the acquisition of ZymoGenetics, Inc. (ZymoGenetics) in October 2010, and through various collaboration agreements entered into during the year. We met our productivity transformation initiative (PTI) objectives and implemented a strategic process designed to achieve a culture of continuous improvement. We launched KOMBIGLYZE (saxagliptin and metformin) in the United States (U.S.) for the treatment of type 2 diabetes in adults. We made key product and pipeline advancements with YERVOY (ipilimumab), dapagliflozin, ELIQUIS* (apixaban) BARACLUDE (entecavir), SPRYCEL (dasatinib) and ORENCIA (abatacept). We received a warning letter at our Manati, Puerto Rico facility and voluntarily recalled certain lots of AVALIDE* (irbesartan-hydrochlorothiazide) from the U.S., Puerto Rican, Canadian, Mexican and Argentinean markets. We repurchased $750 million principal value of our higher interest rate debt through a tender offer and announced a $3.0 billion share repurchase program under which 23 million shares were repurchased in 2010. 2010 Highlights The following table is a summary of our financial highlights: Year Ended December 31, Dollars in Millions, except per share data 2010 2009 Net Sales $ 19,484 $ 18,808 Segment Income 4,642 4,492 Net Earnings from Continuing Operations Attributable to BMS 3,102 3,239 Net Earnings from Discontinued Operations Attributable to BMS 7,373 Net Earnings Attributable to BMS 3,102 10,612 Diluted Earnings Per Share from Continuing Operations Attributable to BMS 1.79 1.63 Non-GAAP Diluted Earnings Per Share from Continuing Operations Attributable to BMS 2.16 1.85 Cash, Cash Equivalents and Marketable Securities 9,982 9,883 Net Sales Worldwide net sales increased 4% primarily due to: Growth in various key products including PLAVIX* (clopidogrel bisulfate); the virology portfolio, which includes BARACLUDE, the SUSTIVA (efavirenz) Franchise and REYATAZ (atazanavir sulfate); ORENCIA and SPRYCEL; and Sales of recently launched ONGLYZA (saxagliptin) and KOMBIGLYZE. Net sales increased from the prior year despite the unfavorable impact of: Increased Medicaid rebates from U.S. healthcare reform; The reduction in our contractual share of ABILIFY* (aripiprazole) net sales from 65% to 58% from the extension of the commercialization and manufacturing agreement with Otsuka Pharmaceutical Co., Ltd. (Otsuka); The declining sales of mature brands from strategic divestitures and generic competition; The AVALIDE* recall; and Government austerity measures in Europe to reduce health care costs. Segment Income The increase in segment income is attributed to: Net sales growth of various key products; More efficient and reduced spending within marketing, selling and administrative; and Reduced promotional spending on certain key brands to coincide with their product life cycle. 37 Table of Contents The increase was partially offset by: Reduced equity income from the impact of generic competition on international PLAVIX* sales from our international partnership with sanofi; and Increased research and development spending to support our maturing pipeline and possible launch of new products in 2011. Net Earnings from Continuing Operations Attributable to Bristol-Myers Squibb Company The decrease is primarily attributed to the unfavorable impact of specified items that affect the comparability of results including: A $236 million charge related to the impairment and loss on sale of manufacturing operations; A $207 million tax charge attributed to U.S. taxable income for earnings of foreign subsidiaries previously considered permanently reinvested offshore; and Gains of $360 million in the prior year from the sale of certain mature brands. The decrease was partially offset by: Reduced upfront licensing and milestone payments; A $125 million litigation settlement charge in 2009; and Increased segment income. Net Earnings from Discontinued Operations Attributable to Bristol-Myers Squibb Company In 2009, we completed the split-off of Mead Johnson resulting in an after-tax gain of approximately $7.2 billion. The results of the Mead Johnson business and related gain are included in discontinued operations. Diluted Earnings Per Share from Continuing Operations Diluted earnings per share (EPS) from continuing operations increased 10% during 2010 due to the lower average outstanding common shares attributed to: The full year impact of the 269 million share reduction resulting from the December 2009 Mead Johnson split-off; and Common stock repurchases of 23 million shares in 2010 made under the stock repurchase program announced in May 2010. Our non-GAAP financial measures, including non-GAAP earnings from continuing operations and related EPS information, are adjusted to exclude certain costs, expenses, gains and losses and other specified items. Our non-GAAP diluted EPS from continuing operations increased 17% during 2010 after adjusting for specified items of $633 million in 2010 and $428 million in 2009. For a detailed listing of specified items and further information and reconciliations of non-GAAP financial measures, see Specified Items and Non-GAAP Financial Measures below. Cash, Cash Equivalents and Marketable Securities Sources of cash, cash equivalents and marketable securities included $4.5 billion generated from operating activities. Primary nonoperating uses of cash, cash equivalents and marketable securities included: Dividend payments of $2.2 billion; Debt repurchase by means of a tender offer of $855 million; Acquisition of ZymoGenetics for $829 million; Common stock repurchases of $576 million; and Capital expenditures of $424 million. Business Environment We conduct our business primarily within the pharmaceutical/biotechnology industry, which is highly competitive and subject to numerous government regulations. Many competitive factors may significantly affect sales of our products, including product efficacy, safety, price and cost-effectiveness; marketing effectiveness; market access; product labeling; quality control and quality assurance of our manufacturing operations; and research and development of new products. To successfully compete for business in the healthcare industry, we must demonstrate that our products offer medical benefits as well as cost advantages. Our new product introductions compete with other products already on the market in the same therapeutic category, in addition to potential competition of new products that competitors may introduce in the future. We manufacture branded products, which are priced higher than generic products. Generic competition is one of our leading challenges globally. In the pharmaceutical/biotechnology industry, the majority of an innovative product commercial value is usually realized during the period that the product has market exclusivity. When a product loses exclusivity, it is no longer protected by a patent and is subject to new competing products in the form of generic brands. Upon exclusivity loss, we can lose a major portion of that product sales in a 38 Table of Contents short period of time. Competitors seeking approval of biological products under a full Biologics License Application (BLA) must file their own safety and efficacy data and address the challenges of biologics manufacturing, which involve more complex processes and are more costly than those of traditional pharmaceutical operations. Under the new U.S. healthcare legislation enacted in 2010, which is described more fully below, there is now an abbreviated path for regulatory approval of generic versions of biological products. This new path for approval of biosimilar products under the U.S. healthcare legislation significantly affects the regulatory data exclusivity for biological products. The new legislation provides a regulatory mechanism that allows for regulatory approval of biologic drugs that are similar to (but not generic copies of) innovative drugs on the basis of less extensive data than is required by a full BLA. It is not possible at this time to reasonably assess the impact of the new U.S. biosimilar legislation on the Company. Globally, the healthcare industry is subject to various government-imposed regulations authorizing prices or price controls that have and will continue to have an impact on our net sales. In March 2010, the U.S. government enacted healthcare reform legislation, signing into law the Patient Protection and Affordable Care Act (HR 3590) and a reconciliation bill containing a package of changes to the healthcare bill. The new legislation makes extensive changes to the current system of healthcare insurance and benefits intended to broaden coverage and reduce costs. These bills significantly change how Americans receive healthcare coverage and how they pay for it. They also have a significant impact on companies, in particular those companies in the pharmaceutical industry and other healthcare related industries, including BMS. We have experienced and will continue to experience additional financial costs and certain other changes to our business as the new healthcare law provisions become effective. For example, minimum rebates on our Medicaid drug sales have increased from 15.1 percent to 23.1 percent and Medicaid rebates have also been extended to drugs used in risk-based Medicaid managed care plans. In addition, we now extend discounts to certain critical access hospitals, cancer hospitals and other covered entities as required by the expansion of the 340B Drug Pricing Program under the Public Health Service Act. In 2011, we will also provide a 50 percent discount on our brand-name drugs to patients within the Medicare Part D coverage gap, also referred to as the Donut Hole and we will pay an annual non-tax-deductible fee to the Federal government based on an allocation of our market share of branded prior year sales to certain U.S. government programs including Medicare, Medicaid, Department of Veterans Affairs, Department of Defense and TRICARE. This fee will be classified for financial reporting purposes as an operating expense. These new discounts and the new pharmaceutical company fee under the 2010 U.S. healthcare reform law, including related regulations for Medicare coverage gap, managed Medicaid and expansion of the Public Health Service 340B program do not have historical claims experience and as such are subject to additional changes in estimates. Higher rebates to Medicaid and Medicaid managed care plans reduced our net sales by $283 million and pre-tax income by $222 million during the year ended December 31, 2010. We also recognized a one-time tax charge of $21 million in the first quarter of 2010 due to the elimination of the tax deductibility of a portion of our retiree healthcare costs. The EPS impact of U.S. healthcare reform in 2010 was $0.10. On an incremental year-over-year basis, we expect U.S. healthcare reform to have an additional negative impact on earnings per share in 2011 of approximately $0.15. This estimate includes an expected reduction of net sales of approximately $250 million due to new discounts associated with the Medicare Part D Donut Hole coverage gap and an increase in marketing, sales and administrative expenses of approximately $250 million due to the new annual non-tax-deductible pharmaceutical company fee. The aggregate financial impact of U.S. healthcare reform over the next few years depends on a number of factors, including but not limited to pending implementation guidance, potential changes in sales volume eligible for the new rebates, discounts or fees, and the impact of cost sharing arrangements with certain alliance partners. A positive impact on our net sales from the expected increase in the number of people with healthcare coverage could potentially occur in the future, but is not expected until 2014 at the earliest. In many markets outside the U.S., we operate in environments of government-mandated, cost-containment programs, or under other regulatory bodies or groups that can exert downward pressure on pricing. Pricing freedom is limited in the UK, for instance, by the operation of a profit control plan and in Germany by the operation of a reference price system. Companies also face significant delays in market access for new products as more than two years can elapse after drug approval before new medicines become available in some countries. The growth of Managed Care Organizations (MCOs) in the U.S. has played a large role in the competition that surrounds the healthcare industry. MCOs seek to reduce healthcare expenditures for participants by making volume purchases and entering into long-term contracts to negotiate discounts with various pharmaceutical providers. Because of the market potential created by the large pool of participants, marketing prescription drugs to MCOs has become an important part of our strategy. Companies compete for inclusion in MCO formularies and we generally have been successful in having our major products included. We believe that developments in the managed care industry, including continued consolidation, have had and will continue to have a downward pressure on prices. Pharmaceutical and biotechnology production processes are complex, highly regulated and vary widely from product to product. Shifting or adding manufacturing capacity can be a lengthy process requiring significant capital expenditures and regulatory approvals. Biologics manufacturing involves more complex processes than those of traditional pharmaceutical operations. As biologics become a larger percentage of our product portfolio, we will continue to make arrangements with third-party manufacturers and to make substantial investments to increase our internal capacity to produce biologics on a commercial scale. One such investment is a new, state-of-the-art manufacturing facility for the production of biologics in Devens, Massachusetts. We expect to submit the site for regulatory approval in late 2011 or 2012. 39 Table of Contents We have maintained a competitive position in the market and strive to uphold this position, which is dependent on our success in discovering, developing and delivering innovative, cost-effective products to help patients prevail over serious diseases. We are the subject of a number of significant pending lawsuits, claims, proceedings and investigations. It is not possible at this time to reasonably assess the final outcomes of these investigations or litigations. For additional discussion of legal matters, see Item 8. Financial Statements Note 26. Legal Proceedings and Contingencies. Strategy Over the past few years, we have transformed our Company into a focused biopharmaceutical company, a transformation that encompasses all areas of our business and operations. This has not only focused our portfolio of products but has yielded and will continue to yield substantial cost savings and cost avoidance. This in turn increases our financial flexibility to take advantage of attractive market opportunities that may arise. In May 2012, we expect the loss of exclusivity in the U.S. for our largest product, PLAVIX*, after which time we expect a rapid, precipitous, and material decline in PLAVIX* net sales and a reduction in net income and operating cash flow. Such events are the norm in the industry when companies experience the loss of exclusivity of a product. Recognizing this fact, we are, and have been, focused on sustaining our business and building a robust foundation for the future. We plan to achieve this foundation by continuing to support and grow our currently marketed products, advancing our pipeline, managing our costs, and maintaining and improving our financial strength with a strong balance sheet. However, these are part of an overall strategy to build the Company. This strategy includes a focus on emerging markets, string-of-pearls, optimizing our mature brands portfolio and managing costs. Our strategy in emerging markets is to develop and commercialize innovative products in key high-growth markets, tailoring the approach to each market. We also remain focused on our acquisition and licensing strategy known as the string-of-pearls with transactions which could range from collaboration and license agreements to the acquisition of companies. In October 2010, we completed our acquisition of ZymoGenetics. We also entered into or restructured collaboration agreements with various companies during 2010 including, Eli Lilly and Company (Lilly), Allergan, Inc., Exelixis, Inc. (Exelixis) and Oncolys BioPharma, Inc. We have continued with our core biopharmaceutical focus and the maximization of the value of our mature brands portfolio. In 2010, we completed the sale of various mature brands and the related manufacturing facilities in various countries. Managing costs is another part of our overall strategy. We executed our PTI, through which we realized $2.5 billion in annual cost savings and cost avoidance based on previous strategic plans for future years. We met our goal of $2.5 billion of cost savings and cost avoidance on an annualized run-rate basis. To achieve this, we reduced general and administrative operations by simplifying, standardizing and outsourcing certain processes and services, rationalized our mature brands portfolio, consolidated our global manufacturing network while eliminating complexity and enhancing profitability, simplified our geographic footprint and implemented a more efficient go-to-market model. Because the $2.5 billion of annual cost savings and avoidance is based on previous strategic plans for future years and because our progress is measured on an annualized run-rate basis, the amount of cost savings and avoidance does not correlate directly with our results of operations. Approximately 60% of the $2.5 billion in annual cost savings and cost avoidance relates to marketing, selling and administrative expenses, 20-25% relates to costs of products sold, and 15-20% relates to research and development expenses. In addition to the PTI, we continue to review our cost structure with the intent to create a modernized, efficient and robust balance between building competitive advantages, securing innovative products and planning for the future. 40 Table of Contents Product and Pipeline Developments We manage our research and development (R&D) programs on a portfolio basis, investing resources in each stage of research and development from early discovery through late-stage development. We continually evaluate our portfolio of R&D assets to ensure that there is an appropriate balance of early-stage and late-stage programs to support future growth. We consider our R&D programs that have entered into Phase III development to be significant, as these programs constitute our late-stage development pipeline. These Phase III development programs include both investigational compounds in Phase III development for initial indications and marketed products that are in Phase III development for additional indications or formulations. Spending on these programs represents approximately 30-40% of our annual R&D expenses. No individual investigational compound or marketed product represented 10% or more of our R&D expenses in any of the last three years. While we do not expect all of our late-stage development programs to make it to market, our late-stage development programs are the R&D programs that could potentially have an impact on our revenue and earnings within the next few years. The following are the recent significant developments in our marketed products and our late-stage pipeline: YERVOY (ipilimumab) a monoclonal antibody currently in the registrational process for the treatment of metastatic melanoma. It is also being studied for other indications including lung cancer as well as adjuvant melanoma and hormone-refractory prostate cancer. In August 2010, the U.S. Food and Drug Administration (FDA) accepted for filing and review the BLA for YERVOY for the treatment of adult patients with advanced melanoma who have been previously treated. The application has been granted a priority review designation by the FDA. The FDA current stated action date on the BLA is March 26, 2011. In May 2010, the YERVOY Marketing Authorization Application (MAA) for metastatic melanoma in pre-treated patients was validated by the European Medicines Agency (EMA). In June 2010, the Company announced positive results from a Phase III randomized double blind study of YERVOY which demonstrated that overall survival was significantly extended in patients with previously-treated metastatic melanoma who received YERVOY. The results were statistically significant for patients receiving YERVOY alone or YERVOY in combination with a gp100 peptide vaccine when compared to those patients who received the control therapy of gp100 alone. Forty-four to 46 percent of patients treated with YERVOY were alive at one year compared to 25 percent of patients treated with the control arm. At two years, 22 to 24 percent of patients treated with YERVOY were alive compared to 14 percent of patients treated with the control arm. In May 2010, the Company announced positive results from a randomized Phase II study evaluating YERVOY in combination with standard chemotherapy in previously untreated patients with advanced non-small cell lung cancer. The study, known as 041, met the predefined criteria for significant improvement (p-value of <0.1) in immune-related progression-free survival, the primary endpoint, over chemotherapy alone. An additional analysis of progression-free survival, assessed using the traditional modified World Health Organization criteria, also reached statistical significance in one of the two dosing schedules that combined YERVOY with standard chemotherapy. ELIQUIS* (apixaban) an oral Factor Xa inhibitor in Phase III development for the prevention and treatment of venous thromboembolic disorders and stroke prevention in atrial fibrillation that is part of our strategic alliance with Pfizer, Inc. (Pfizer) Based upon discussions with the FDA and in agreement with Pfizer, we expect to submit an NDA filing in the U.S. including data from both the AVERROES trial and the ARISTOTLE trial, assuming a positive outcome in the ARISTOTLE study, for an indication in stroke prevention in atrial fibrillation, which will cover the broadest spectrum of patients in one single filing. We expect to have the initial top line results from the ARISTOTLE data in the second quarter of 2011 and submit regulatory filings in the US and Europe either in the third or fourth quarter of 2011. In February 2011, the Company and Pfizer published the full results of the AVERROES study of ELIQUIS* in The New England Journal of Medicine . The study demonstrated that, for patients with atrial fibrillation (AF) who were expected or demonstrated to be unsuitable for a vitamin K antagonist therapy such as warfarin, ELIQUIS* was statistically superior to aspirin in reducing the composite of stroke or systematic embolism, without a significant increase in major bleeding, fatal bleeding or intracranial bleeding. There were no significant differences in the risk of hemorrhagic stroke between ELIQUIS* and aspirin. The study results also showed that ELIQUIS* demonstrated superiority for its secondary efficacy endpoint in reducing the composite of stroke, systematic embolism, mycordial infarction or vascular death for patients with AF when compared with aspirin. In December 2010, the Company and Pfizer published results from the Phase III ADVANCE-3 study of ELIQUIS* in The New England Journal of Medicine . The results showed that ELIQUIS* was statistically superior to 40 mg once-daily enoxaparin with comparable rates of bleeding in the prevention of venous thromboembolism following total hip replacement surgery. In November 2010, the Company and Pfizer reported that the Phase III APPRAISE-2 clinical trial in patients with recent Acute Coronary Syndrome treated with ELIQUIS* or placebo in addition to mono or dual antiplatelet therapy was discontinued. The study was stopped early on the recommendation of an independent Data Monitoring Committee due to clear evidence of a clinically important increase in bleeding among patients randomized to ELIQUIS* which was not offset by clinically meaningful reductions in ischemic events. 41 Table of Contents In August 2010, the positive preliminary data from the AVERROES trial were presented at the European Society of Cardiology congress in Stockholm, Sweden. The preliminary data demonstrated that ELIQUIS* significantly reduced the relative risk of a composite stroke or systematic embolism by 54 percent without a significant increase in major bleeding, fatal bleeding and intracranial bleeding compared with aspirin in patients who were expected or demonstrated to be unsuitable for warfarin treatment. Minor bleeding was significantly increased. In June 2010, the Company and Pfizer had announced that the Phase III AVERROES trial was ending early due to clear evidence of efficacy. After an interim analysis by the Independent Data Monitoring Committee showed a clinically important reduction in stroke and systematic embolism in patients with atrial fibrillation considered intolerant of or unsuitable for warfarin therapy who received ELIQUIS* as compared to aspirin. This interim analysis also demonstrated an acceptable safety profile for ELIQUIS* compared to aspirin. In March 2010, results from the ADVANCE-2 study were published in The Lancet . Results, which were presented in July 2009, showed that ELIQUIS* was statistically superior to 40 mg once daily enoxaparin in reducing the incidence of venous thromboembolism in patients undergoing elective total knee replacement surgery, according to ADVANCE-2 study results. The study results also showed numerically lower rates of major and clinically relevant non-major bleeding in patients treated with ELIQUIS* compared to those treated with enoxaparin. These latter results did not meet statistical significance. In March 2010, the ELIQUIS* Marketing Authorization Application for the prevention of venous thromboembolic events in adult patients who have undergone elective hip or knee replacement was validated by the European Medicines Agency. NULOJIX (belatacept) a fusion protein with novel immunosuppressive activity targeted at prevention of solid organ transplant rejection. In May 2010, the FDA issued a complete response letter regarding our BLA for NULOJIX for an indication of prophylaxis of organ rejection and preservation of a functioning allograft in adult patients receiving renal transplants with use in combination with interleukin-2 (IL-2) receptor antagonist, mycophenolic acid (MPA), and corticosteroids. In December 2010, the FDA informed us that the information we submitted regarding NULOJIX is a Complete Response to the request for additional information outlined in the FDA complete response letter. The Prescription Drug User Fee Act (PDUFA) date for FDA action on the BLA is June 15, 2011. The FDA has advised us that we must resolve the GMP issues raised in the FDA recent warning letter regarding our manufacturing facility in Manati, Puerto Rico prior to its granting approval of our pending BLA for NULOJIX. In December 2010, we notified the FDA that our Manati facility was inspection-ready. If upon re-inspection the FDA is not satisfied, this could result in a delay in the approval of the NULOJIX filing. See Part I Item 1A. Risk Factors We may experience difficulties and delays in the manufacturing, distribution and sale of our products for more information. In May 2010, NULOJIX* was the subject of eight clinical presentations related to kidney transplantation at the American Transplant Congress. In March 2010, the FDA Cardiovascular and Renal Drugs Advisory Committee voted 13 to 5 to recommend approval of NULOJIX*, a selective co-simulation blocker for the prophylaxis of acute rejection in de novo kidney transplant patients. The FDA is not bound by the recommendations of its Advisory Committee, but takes its advice into consideration when reviewing new drug applications. In February 2010, the NULOJIX* MAA for the treatment of prophylaxis of organ rejection in kidney transplant patients was validated by the EMA. Dapagliflozin an oral SGLT2 inhibitor in Phase III development for the treatment of diabetes that is part of our strategic alliance with AstraZeneca In December 2010, the Company and AstraZeneca completed the submission of a New Drug Application with the FDA and a Marketing Authorization Application with the European Medicines Agency for dapagliflozin as a once-daily oral therapy for the treatment of adult patients with type 2 diabetes. The MAA was validated by the European Medicines Agency in January 2011. In September 2010, the Company and AstraZeneca announced results from a randomized, double blind Phase III clinical study of dapagliflozin at the 46 th European Association for the Study of Diabetes (EASD) Annual Meeting which demonstrated that the addition of dapagliflozin to glimepiride (a sulphonylurea) therapy produced significant reductions in glycosylated hemoglobin levels (HbA1c) in adult patients with type 2 diabetes compared to glimepiride alone. The study also demonstrated that dapagliflozin plus glimepiride achieved reductions in the secondary efficacy endpoints of change in total body weight, oral glucose tolerance test (OGTT) and fasting plasma glucose (FPG) levels from baseline at week 24 compared to placebo plus glimepiride. More people taking dapagliflozin and glimepiride were able to achieve a target HbA1c of less than 7% compared to patients taking glimepiride alone. Also, drug-related adverse affects were reported at a similar rate between treatment groups, but signs, symptoms and other reports suggestive of genital tract infections, but not urinary tract infections, were more frequently reported in dapagliflozin treated subjects. 42 Table of Contents In September 2010, the Company and AstraZeneca also announced at the EASD results from a randomized, double-blind Phase III clinical study in adults with type 2 diabetes inadequately controlled on metformin therapy alone. The study demonstrated dapagliflozin was non-inferior compared to glipizide in improving HbA1c when added to existing metformin therapy during a 52-week treatment period. The study also demonstrated that dapagliflozin plus metformin achieved significant reductions in key efficacy secondary endpoints: reduction in total body weight from baseline, compared with a weight gain on glipizide plus metformin therapy and a reduced number of patients reporting one or more hypoglycemic events. Also, frequencies of adverse events, serious adverse events and study discontinuations were comparable across treatment groups, but signs, symptoms and other reports suggestive of urinary tract or genital infections were more common in dapagliflozin treated subjects. In June 2010, findings from a 24-week Phase III clinical study were published that demonstrated that dapagliflozin, administered as monotherapy, achieved statistically significant mean reductions at 5 mg and 10 mg doses once daily in the primary endpoint of glycosylated hemoglobin levels in treatment-na ve adult patients with newly diagnosed type 2 diabetes, compared to placebo. In June 2010, results from a 24-week Phase III clinical study were presented that demonstrated that the addition of dapagliflozin achieved reductions in the primary endpoint, glycosylated hemoglobin level, in inadequately controlled type 2 diabetes patients who were treated with insulin (with or without oral anti-diabetes medications (OADS)), compared to placebo plus insulin (with or without OADS). The study also demonstrated that dapagliflozin achieved reductions in the secondary endpoints that evaluated the change in total body weight from baseline, change in baseline from in mean daily insulin dose and change from baseline in fasting plasma glucose. PLAVIX* a platelet aggregation inhibitor that is part of our alliance with sanofi-aventis (sanofi) In January 2011, the Company and sanofi announced that the FDA has granted the companies an additional six-month period of exclusivity to market PLAVIX*. Exclusivity for PLAVIX* in the U.S. is now scheduled to expire on May 17, 2012. In March 2010, the Company and sanofi announced revisions to the U.S. prescribing information for PLAVIX*, which include a boxed warning. The boxed warning concerns the diminished effectiveness of PLAVIX* in patients who have a genetic variation leading to reduced formation of the active metabolite. These patients, who are designated as poor metabolizers, represent, according to prescribing information, approximately 2% of whites, 4% of blacks and 14% of Chinese. The percentage of poor metabolizers is estimated to be approximately 3% of the population, based on published studies. These revisions are in addition to the updates to the PLAVIX* labeling reported in November 2009 with warnings about the use of PRILOSEC* (omeprazole) and certain other drugs that could interfere with PLAVIX* by reducing its effectiveness. In March 2010, the Company and sanofi announced the approval by the European Commission of the dual antiplatelet combination tablet DUOPLAVIN*/DUOCOVER* (clopidogrel 75 mg and acetylsalicylic acid 100 mg or 75 mg), which is indicated for the prevention of atherothrombotic events in adult patients already taking both clopidogrel and acetylsalicylic acid (ASA). AVALIDE* an angiotensin II receptor blocker for the treatment of hypertension and diabetic nephropathy that is also part of the sanofi alliance On January 14, 2011, BMS and our partner sanofi-aventis voluntarily recalled certain lots of AVALIDE* from the U.S., Puerto Rican, Canadian, Mexican and Argentinean markets due to the identification of a less soluble form of irbesartan found in lots produced at our Humacao, Puerto Rico, facility and four batches produced at our Evansville, Indiana, facility which has been attributed to a manufacturing process change. Supply of AVALIDE* to these markets will be affected indefinitely. Total AVALIDE* sales in these countries were $355 million in 2010. We are working with our partner sanofi-aventis to identify all possible solutions to this issue, including process adjustments and alternate supply sources. ABILIFY* an antipsychotic agent for the treatment of schizophrenia, bipolar mania disorder and major depressive disorder that is part of our strategic alliance with Otsuka In February 2011, the Company and Otsuka announced that the FDA approved ABILIFY* as an adjunct to the mood stabilizers lithium or valproate for the maintenance treatment of Bipolar I Disorder. REYATAZ a protease inhibitor for the treatment of HIV In February 2011, the FDA approved an update to the labeling for REYATAZ to include dose recommendations in HIV-infected pregnant women. In HIV combination therapy, treatment with the recommended adult dose of REYATAZ 300 mg, boosted with 100 mg of ritonavir, achieved minimum plasma concentrations (24 hours post-dose) during the third trimester of pregnancy comparable to that observed historically in HIV-infected adults. During the post partum period, atazanavir concentrations may be increased; therefore, while no dose adjustment is necessary, patients should be monitored for two months after delivery. 43 Table of Contents BARACLUDE an oral antiviral agent for the treatment of chronic hepatitis B In October 2010, the FDA approved the supplemental New Drug Application of BARACLUDE for the treatment of chronic hepatitis B in adult patients with decompensated liver disease. SPRYCEL an oral inhibitor of multiple tyrosine kinases indicated for the treatment of adults with chronic, accelerated, or myeloid or lymphoid blast phase chronic myeloid leukemia with resistance or intolerance to prior therapy, including GLEEVEC* (imatinib meslylate) and first-line treatment of adults with Philadelphia chromosome-positive chronic myeloid leukemia in chronic phase. SPRYCEL is part of our strategic alliance with Otsuka. In December 2010, the Company announced that SPRYCEL 100 mg once daily received Marketing Authorization from the European Commission for the treatment of adult patients with newly diagnosed Philadelphia chromosome-positive chronic myeloid leukemia in chronic phase. In December 2010, the Company and Otsuka announced at the 52 nd Annual Meeting of the American Society of Hematology that the 18-month follow-up results from the Phase III DASISION study of SPRYCEL in the first-line treatment of adults with Philadelphia chromosome-positive chronic phase chronic myeloid leukemia were consistent with 12 month data in which SPRYCEL demonstrated higher and faster rates of complete cytogenetic response and major molecular response compared to imatinib. In October 2010, the Company and Otsuka announced that the FDA approved SPRYCEL 100 mg once daily for the treatment of adult patients with newly diagnosed Philadelphia chromosome-positive chronic myeloid leukemia in chronic phase. In July 2010, the Company submitted for review in Japan the supplemental New Drug Application for SPRYCEL for the treatment of adult patients with newly diagnosed chronic myeloid leukemia. In June 2010, the Company and Otsuka announced Phase III study results in which SPRYCEL 100 mg once daily demonstrated a superior rate of confirmed complete cytogenetic response compared to GLEEVEC*. The study showed that 77 percent of SPRYCEL patients versus 66 percent of GLEEVEC* patients achieved confirmed complete cytogenetic response rates by 12 months. In June 2010, the Company and Otsuka announced four year follow-up results from a Phase III randomized, open-label, dose-optimization study of SPRYCEL in chronic-phase chronic myeloid leukemia patients resistant or intolerant to GLEEVEC*. At four years, for all patients administered SPRYCEL 100 mg once daily, overall survival was 82% (95% CI: 76%-88%) and progression-free survival was 66% (95% CI: 57%-74%). The four-year safety data from this study are consistent with the previously reported safety profile of SPRYCEL 100 mg once daily. ORENCIA a fusion protein indicated for rheumatoid arthritis In December 2010, the FDA accepted for review a supplemental Biologics License Application for the subcutaneous formulation of ORENCIA, a treatment for adult patients with moderate to severe rheumatoid arthritis administered through an injection into the skin. The PDUFA date is August 4, 2011. In November 2010, the Company announced that new Phase III clinical data showed that a weekly subcutaneous injection of an investigational formulation of ORENCIA, following a single intravenous (I.V.) loading dose, provided an improvement in disease activity similar to the improvement seen with monthly I.V. administration of ORENCIA in patients with moderate to severe rheumatoid arthritis. In July 2010, the Japanese Ministry of Health, Labour and Welfare approved the Japanese New Drug Application for ORENCIA for the treatment of adults with rheumatoid arthritis who have had an inadequate response to existing treatment. In July 2010, the European Commission approved a new indication for ORENCIA, in combination with methotrexate (MTX), for the treatment of moderate to severe rheumatoid arthritis in adult patients who have responded inadequately to previous therapy with one or more disease-modifying anti-rheumatic drugs including MTX or a TNF-alpha inhibitor. In January 2010, the European Commission approved ORENCIA in combination with methotrexate for the treatment of moderate to severe active polyarticular juvenile idiopathic arthritis in pediatric patients six years of age and older who have had an insufficient response to other disease-modifying anti-rheumatic drugs, including at least one TNF inhibitor. 44 Table of Contents ONGLYZA/KOMBIGLYZE a treatment for type 2 diabetes that is part of our strategic alliance with AstraZeneca PLC (AstraZeneca) In November 2010, the FDA approved KOMBIGLYZE XR (saxagliptin and metformin HCl extended-release) for the treatment of type 2 diabetes in adults. KOMBIGLYZE XR is the first and only once-a-day metformin extended-release (XR) plus dipeptidyl peptidase-4 inhibitor combination tablet offering strong glycemic control across glycosylated hemoglobin levels, fasting plasma glucose and post-prandial glucose. In July 2010, the Marketing Authorization Application for KOMGIBLYZE (known in the U.S. as KOMBIGLYZE), a fixed dose combination of ONGLYZA and metformin tablets, as a treatment for adults with type 2 diabetes was validated by the European Medicines Agency. In June 2010, the Company and AstraZeneca announced results from a 52-week Phase IIIb study in adults with type 2 diabetes who had inadequate glycemic control on metformin therapy plus diet and exercise. The study found that the addition of ONGLYZA 5 mg to existing metformin therapy achieved the primary objective of demonstrating non-inferiority compared to the addition of titrated glipizide (sulphonylurea) to existing metformin therapy in reducing glycosylated hemoglobin levels. The study also found that treatment with ONGLYZA 5 mg plus metformin resulted in a statistically significant lower proportion of subjects reporting hypoglycemic events and statistically significant weight loss compared to titrated glipizide plus metformin. ONGLYZA 5 mg plus metformin also resulted in a significantly smaller rise per week in HbA1c from week 24 to week 52 compared to titrated glipizide plus metformin. In June 2010, the Company and AstraZeneca announced results from a 76-week Phase III study of ONGLYZA as initial combination therapy with metformin, which produced long-term glycemic improvements (as measured by HbA1c levels) in treatment-na ve adults with type 2 diabetes mellitus inadequately controlled on diet and exercise compared to treatment with an investigational 10 mg dose of ONGLYZA or metformin alone. The study also demonstrated that a higher number of patients were able to achieve the American Diabetes Association recommended glycosylated hemoglobin level target of less than 7% with ONGLYZA and metformin as initial combination therapy, compared to monotherapy of either treatment at week 76. In March 2010, the Company and AstraZeneca announced the commencement of the Saxagliptin Assessment of Vascular Outcomes Recorded in Patients with Diabetes Mellitus trial (SAVOR-TIMI 53), a multicenter, randomized, double-blind, placebo-controlled Phase IV study, to evaluate treatment with ONGLYZA in adult type 2 diabetes patients with cardiovascular risk factors. The five year study will follow approximately 12,000 patients with type 2 diabetes, who have either a history of previous cardiovascular events or multiple risk factors for vascular disease, and includes patients with renal impairment. Necitumumab (IMC-11F8) an investigational anti-cancer agent, which is part of our strategic alliance with Lilly In January 2011, the Company and Lilly announced that enrollment was stopped in the Phase III INSPIRE study of necitumumab as a first-line treatment for advanced non-small cell lung cancer. The trial is evaluating the addition of necitumumab to a combination of ALIMTA* (pemetrexed for injection) and cisplatin. The decision to stop enrollment followed an Independent Data Monitoring Committee (DMC) recommendation that no new or recently enrolled patients continue treatment in the trial because of safety concerns related to thromboembolism in the experimental arm of the study. The DMC also noted that patients who have already received two or more cycles of necitumumab appear to have a lower ongoing risk for these safety concerns. These patients may choose to remain on the trial, after being informed of the additional potential risks. Investigators will continue to assess patients after two cycles to determine if there is a potential benefit from treatment. Necitumumab continues to be studied in another Phase III trial named SQUIRE. This study is evaluating necitumumab as a potential treatment for a different type of lung cancer called squamous non-small cell lung cancer in combination with GEMZAR* (gemcitibane HCl for injection) and cisplatin. The same independent DMC recommended that this trial continue because no safety concerns have been observed. XL-184 In June 2010, the Company terminated its development collaboration with Exelixis for the experimental cancer drug XL-184 with all rights returning to Exelixis. 45 Table of Contents RESULTS OF OPERATIONS Our results from continuing operations exclude the results related to the Mead Johnson business prior to its split-off in December 2009, the ConvaTec business prior to its divestiture in August 2008 and the Medical Imaging business prior to its divestiture in January 2008. These businesses have been segregated from continuing operations and included in discontinued operations for all years presented, see Discontinued Operations below. Our results of continuing operations were as follows: Year Ended December 31, Dollars in Millions 2010 2009 2008 % Change 2010 vs. 2009 % Change 2009 vs. 2008 Net Sales $ 19,484 $ 18,808 $ 17,715 4 % 6 % Total Expenses $ 13,413 $ 13,206 $ 12,939 2 % 2 % Earnings from Continuing Operations before Income Taxes $ 6,071 $ 5,602 $ 4,776 8 % 17 % % of net sales 31.2 % 29.8 % 27.0 % Provision for Income Taxes $ 1,558 $ 1,182 $ 1,090 32 % 8 % Effective tax rate 25.7 % 21.1 % 22.8 % Net Earnings from Continuing Operations $ 4,513 $ 4,420 $ 3,686 2 % 20 % % of net sales 23.2 % 23.5 % 20.8 % Attributable to Noncontrolling Interest $ 1,411 $ 1,181 $ 989 19 % 19 % % of net sales 7.2 % 6.3 % 5.6 % Attributable to Bristol-Myers Squibb Company $ 3,102 $ 3,239 $ 2,697 (4 )% 20 % % of net sales 15.9 % 17.2 % 15.2 % Net Sales The composition of the change in net sales was as follows: Year Ended December 31, 2010 vs. 2009 2009 vs. 2008 Net Sales Analysis of % Change Analysis of % Change Dollars in Millions 2010 2009 2008 Total Change Volume Price Foreign Exchange Total Change Volume Price Foreign Exchange U.S. $ 12,613 $ 11,867 $ 10,565 6 % 3 % 3 % 12 % 5 % 7 % Non-U.S. 6,871 6,941 7,150 (1 )% 2 % (4 )% 1 % (3 )% 3 % (6 )% Total $ 19,484 $ 18,808 $ 17,715 4 % 2 % 1 % 1 % 6 % 4 % 4 % (2 )% U.S. Net Sales U.S. net sales growth in 2010 was attributed to increased volume and higher average net selling prices. The impact of U.S. price increases taken in 2010 was partially offset by: Increased Medicaid rebates attributed to healthcare reform; and The reduction in our contractual share of ABILIFY* net sales from 65% to 58% effective January 1, 2010. In 2010, PLAVIX* and ABILIFY* represented 49% and 16% of total U.S. net sales, respectively. PLAVIX* contributed 80% of total U.S. net sales growth driven primarily by higher average net selling prices. ABILIFY* U.S. net sales decreased 6% due to changes in the ABILIFY* collaboration agreement. In 2009, PLAVIX* and ABILIFY* represented 47% and 18% of total U.S. net sales, respectively. PLAVIX* contributed 49% of total U.S. net sales growth and was driven by higher average net selling process and increased demand. ABILIFY* contributed 31% of total U.S. net sales growth and was driven by increased demand. Most key products also contributed to 2010 and 2009 U.S. net sales growth. International Net Sales International net sales remained relatively flat in 2010 as lower average net selling prices were mostly offset by increased volume and a slight favorability in foreign exchange. The lower average net selling prices were primarily attributed to government austerity measures in Europe to reduce health care costs. 46 Table of Contents The 2010 international sales volume reflects: Increased net sales of BARACLUDE, the HIV portfolio, SPRYCEL, ABILIFY* and ORENCIA; Decreased net sales of mature brands attributed to divestitures and generic competition; and Decreased net sales of PLAVIX* and AVAPRO*(irbesartan)/AVALIDE* attributed to increased generic competition. The 2009 international net sales decrease includes a 6% negative impact of foreign exchange partially offset by the same factors impacting 2010 sales growth. Our reported international net sales do not include copromotion sales reported by our alliance partner, sanofi for PLAVIX* and AVAPRO*/AVALIDE*, which decreased in 2010 and 2009 due to generic competition. Net sales of mature brands and businesses that were divested during 2008 through 2010 represented approximately 1% of total net sales in each year. Further details on both domestic and international key product net sales are discussed below. In general, our business is not seasonal. For information on U.S. pharmaceutical prescriber demand, reference is made to the table within Estimated End-User Demand below, which sets forth a comparison of changes in net sales to the estimated total prescription growth (for both retail and mail order customers) for certain of our key pharmaceutical and new products. The U.S. and non-U.S. net sales are categorized based upon the location of the customer. We recognize revenue net of various sales adjustments to arrive at net sales as reported on the consolidated statements of earnings. These adjustments are referred to as gross-to-net sales adjustments and are further described in Critical Accounting Policies below. The reconciliation of our gross sales to net sales by each significant category of gross-to-net sales adjustments were as follows: Year Ended December 31, Dollars in Millions 2010 2009 2008 Gross Sales $ 21,681 $ 20,555 $ 19,370 Gross-to-Net Sales Adjustments Charge-Backs Related to Government Programs (605 ) (513 ) (487 ) Cash Discounts (255 ) (253 ) (235 ) Managed Healthcare Rebates and Other Contract Discounts (499 ) (439 ) (360 ) Medicaid Rebates (453 ) (229 ) (205 ) Sales Returns (88 ) (101 ) (163 ) Other Adjustments (297 ) (212 ) (205 ) Total Gross-to-Net Sales Adjustments (2,197 ) (1,747 ) (1,655 ) Net Sales $ 19,484 $ 18,808 $ 17,715 The activities and ending balances of each significant category of gross-to-net sales reserve adjustments were as follows: Dollars in Millions Charge-Backs Related to Government Programs Cash Discounts Managed Healthcare Rebates and Other Contract Discounts Medicaid Rebates Sales Returns Other Adjustments Women, Infants and Children (WIC) Rebates Total Balance at January 1, 2009 $ 45 $ 31 $ 154 $ 133 $ 209 $ 115 $ 195 $ 882 Provision related to sales made in current period 509 252 438 279 91 222 1,791 Provision related to sales made in prior periods 4 1 1 (50 ) 10 (10 ) (44 ) Returns and payments (513 ) (253 ) (395 ) (196 ) (111 ) (208 ) (1,676 ) Impact of foreign currency translation (2 ) 1 2 1 Discontinued operations (3 ) (3 ) (30 ) (33 ) (195 ) (264 ) Balance at December 31, 2009 $ 42 $ 26 $ 199 $ 166 $ 169 $ 88 $ $ 690 Provision related to sales made in current period 606 255 496 454 118 302 2,231 Provision related to sales made in prior periods (1 ) 3 (1 ) (30 ) (5 ) (34 ) Returns and payments (599 ) (252 ) (482 ) (292 ) (69 ) (256 ) (1,950 ) Impact of foreign currency translation (1 ) (2 ) (3 ) Balance at December 31, 2010 $ 48 $ 29 $ 216 $ 327 $ 187 $ 127 $ $ 934 47 Table of Contents Gross-to-net sales adjustments as a percentage of gross sales were 10.1% in 2010 and 8.5% in both 2009 and 2008 and are primarily a function of gross sales trends, changes in sales mix and contractual and legislative discounts and rebates. In 2010, gross-to-net sales adjustments increased overall by 26% which was primarily attributed to the enactment of U.S. healthcare reform. Expected future increases in gross-to-net sales adjustments related to healthcare reform are further discussed in Executive Summary Business Environment above. Specifically in 2010: Medicaid rebates increased due to the change in minimum rebates on drug sales from 15.1% to 23.1% and the extension of the Medicaid rebate rate to drugs sold to risk-based Medicaid managed care organizations. Managed healthcare rebates and other contract discounts increased mainly due to increased sales. Charge-backs related to government programs increased due to increased sales in the U.S. as well as additional rebates required in certain European countries attributed to government austerity measures. Sales returns decreased primarily due to overall reduced provisions for various mature brands partially offset by a $44 million charge for estimated returns associated with the AVALIDE* recall. Other adjustments increased overall due to additional rebates required for certain products sold in Europe attributed to government austerity measures and higher discounts and increased rebates for coupon programs. In 2009, gross-to-net sales adjustments increased by 6%. Specifically in 2009: Managed healthcare rebates and other contract discounts increased by 22% primarily due to higher PLAVIX* Medicare sales and an increase in contractual discount rates. Sales returns decreased by 38% primarily due to lower provisions for PRAVACHOL and ZERIT, partially offset by increased provisions for SPRYCEL and mature brands driven by higher than anticipated sales returns. Medicaid rebates included refunds from net overpayments of Medicaid rebates of $60 million from the three year period 2002 to 2004 after the Center for Medicare and Medicaid Services policy group approved our revised calculations. 48 Table of Contents Net sales of key products represent 84% of total net sales in 2010, 81% in 2009 and 77% in 2008. The following table presents U.S. and international net sales by key products, the percentage change from the prior period and the foreign exchange impact when compared to the prior period.

Estimated total U.S. prescription demand decreased 1% in 2010 and increased 4% in 2009. International net sales continue to be impacted by the launch of generic clopidogrel products in the EU countries since August 2008. This has a negative impact on both our net sales as it relates to our EU sales in comarketing countries and our equity in net income of affiliates as it relates to our share of sales from our partnership with sanofi in Europe and Asia. We expect continued erosion of PLAVIX* net sales in the EU, which will impact both our international net sales and our equity in net income of affiliates. In January 2011, the Company and sanofi announced that the FDA has granted the companies an additional six-month period of exclusivity to market PLAVIX*. Exclusivity for PLAVIX* in the U.S. is now scheduled to expire on May 17, 2012. See Item 8. Financial Statements Note 26. Legal Proceedings and Contingencies PLAVIX* Litigation, for further discussion on PLAVIX* exclusivity litigation in both the U.S. and EU. AVAPRO*/AVALIDE * (known in the EU as APROVEL*/KARVEA*) an angiotensin II receptor blocker for the treatment of hypertension and diabetic nephropathy that is also part of the sanofi alliance U.S. and international net sales decreased in 2010 primarily due to decreased overall demand due to generic competition in the EU and reduced supply of AVALIDE* in addition to a $44 million sales return adjustment recorded as a result of the AVALIDE* recall. Estimated total U.S. prescription demand decreased 17% in 2010. U.S. net sales decreased in 2009 primarily due to decreased overall demand as estimated total U.S. prescription demand decreased 9% in 2009. International net sales increased in 2009 primarily due to higher average net selling prices partially offset by an unfavorable foreign exchange impact. ABILIFY* an antipsychotic agent for the treatment of schizophrenia, bipolar mania disorder and major depressive disorder and is part of our strategic alliance with Otsuka U.S. net sales decreased in 2010 primarily due to the reduction in our contractual share of net sales recognized from 65% to 58% and increased Medicaid rebates from healthcare reform. The decrease was partially offset by higher average net selling prices and increased overall demand. U.S. net sales increased in 2009 primarily due to increased overall demand, new indications for certain patients with bipolar 1 disorder and major depressive disorder, and higher average net selling prices. The 2009 increase was partially offset by $49 million of amortization of the $400 million extension payment made to Otsuka in April 2009. Estimated total U.S. prescription demand increased 5% in 2010 and 26% in 2009. In 2010 and 2009, international net sales increased due to increased prescription demand, which was aided by a new bipolar indication in the second quarter of 2008 in the EU, offset by an unfavorable foreign exchange impact in 2009. REYATAZ a protease inhibitor for the treatment of HIV U.S. net sales increased in 2010 primarily due to higher estimated total U.S. prescription demand of 4%. U.S. net sales increased in 2009 due to higher estimated total U.S. prescription demand of 8% and higher average net selling prices. In 2010 and 2009, international net sales increased primarily due to higher demand across most markets with Europe being the key driver due to the June 2008 approval for first-line treatment. SUSTIVA Franchise a non-nucleoside reverse transcriptase inhibitor for the treatment of HIV, which includes SUSTIVA, an antiretroviral drug, and bulk efavirenz, which is also included in the combination therapy, ATRIPLA* (efavirenz 600 mg/emtricitabine 200 mg/tenofovir disoproxil fumarate 300 mg), a product sold through a joint venture with Gilead U.S. net sales increased in 2010 primarily due to higher estimated total U.S. prescription demand of 7%. In 2009, U.S. net sales increased primarily due to higher estimated total U.S. prescription demand of 10% as well as higher average net selling prices. In 2010, international net sales increased primarily due to higher demand partially offset by an unfavorable foreign exchange. In 2009, international net sales increased primarily due to continued demand generated from the launch of ATRIPLA* in Canada and the EU in the fourth quarter of 2007 partially offset by an unfavorable foreign exchange impact. BARACLUDE an oral antiviral agent for the treatment of chronic hepatitis B Worldwide net sales in 2010 and 2009 increased primarily due to continued strong demand in international markets. We continue to implement our global campaign to raise awareness about chronic hepatitis B as part of our overall market expansion effort. 50 Table of Contents ERBITUX* a monoclonal antibody designed to exclusively target and block the Epidermal Growth Factor Receptor, which is expressed on the surface of certain cancer cells in multiple tumor types as well as normal cells and is currently indicated for use against colorectal cancer and head and neck cancer. ERBITUX* is part of our strategic alliance with Lilly. Sold by us almost exclusively in the U.S., net sales continue to decrease primarily due to lower demand and lower average net selling prices. SPRYCEL an oral inhibitor of multiple tyrosine kinases indicated for the treatment of adults with chronic, accelerated, or myeloid or lymphoid blast phase chronic myeloid leukemia with resistance or intolerance to prior therapy, including GLEEVEC* (imatinib meslylate) and first-line treatment of adults with Philadelphia chromosome-positive chronic myeloid leukemia in chronic phase. SPRYCEL is part of our strategic alliance with Otsuka. Worldwide net sales increased primarily due to higher demand in previously launched markets, growth attributed to recently launched markets as well as higher U.S. average net selling prices. In the fourth quarter of 2010, SPRYCEL 100 mg once daily was approved as a first-line treatment of adult patients with newly diagnosed Philadelphia chromosome-positive chronic myeloid leukemia in chronic phase in the U.S. and the EU. IXEMPRA a microtubule inhibitor for the treatment of patients with metastatic or locally advanced breast cancer and is part of our strategic alliance with Otsuka Net sales continue to remain flat. ORENCIA a fusion protein indicated for adult patients with moderate to severe rheumatoid arthritis who have had an inadequate response to one or more currently available treatments, such as methotrexate or anti-tumor necrosis factor therapy In 2010 worldwide net sales increased primarily due to increased demand. U.S. net sales were also impacted by higher average selling prices. In 2009, worldwide net sales increased primarily due to increased demand. ONGLYZA/KOMBIGLYZE treatment for type 2 diabetes ONGLYZA was launched in various countries in the third quarter of 2009. KOMBIGLYZE was launched in the fourth quarter of 2010. Mature Products and All Other includes products which lost exclusivity in major markets and over the counter brands U.S. net sales remained relatively flat in 2010 and 2009 as the continued generic erosion of certain products was partially offset by higher average net selling prices. International net sales decreased in 2010 and 2009 due to continued generic erosion of certain brands including TAXOL and PRAVACHOL (pravastatin sodium), lower average net selling prices in Europe, the year over year impact of the rationalization and divestitures of our non-strategic product portfolio and lower demand for certain over the counter products. Net sales in 2010 included $15 million of RECOTHROM net sales, a product acquired through our ZymoGenetics acquisition in October 2010. See Item 8. Financial Statements Note 5. Acquisitions for further details. The estimated U.S. prescription change data provided throughout this report includes information only from the retail and mail order channels and does not reflect information from other channels such as hospitals, home healthcare, clinics, federal facilities including VA hospitals, and long-term care, among others. In the first quarter of 2009, we changed our service provider for U.S. prescription data to Wolters Kluwer Health, Inc. (WK), a supplier of market research audit data for the pharmaceutical industry, for external reporting purposes and internal demand for most products. Prior to 2009, we used prescription data based on the Next-Generation Prescription Service Version 2.0 of the National Prescription Audit provided by IMS Health (IMS). We continuously seek to improve the quality of our estimates of prescription change amounts and ultimate patient/consumer demand by reviewing estimate calculation methodologies, processes and analyzing internal and third-party data. We expect to continue to review and refine our methodologies and processes for calculation of these estimates and will continue to review and analyze our own and third parties data used in such calculations. The estimated prescription data is based on the Source Prescription Audit provided by the above suppliers and is a product of their respective recordkeeping and projection processes. As such, the data is subject to the inherent limitations of estimates based on sampling and may include a margin of error. 51 Table of Contents The change in SPRYCEL demand is calculated based upon tablets sold though retail and mail order channels based upon data obtained from the IMS Health (IMS) National Sales Perspectives Audit, which is a product of IMS own recordkeeping and projection processes. As such, the data is subject to the inherent limitations of estimates based on sampling and may include a margin of error. We calculated the estimated total U.S. prescription change on a weighted-average basis to reflect the fact that mail order prescriptions include a greater volume of product supplied, compared to retail prescriptions. Mail order prescriptions typically reflect a 90-day prescription whereas retail prescriptions typically reflect a 30-day prescription. The calculation is derived by multiplying mail order prescription data by a factor that approximates three and adding to this the retail prescriptions. We believe that a calculation of estimated total U.S. prescription change based on this weighted-average approach provides a superior estimate of total prescription demand in retail and mail order channels. We use this methodology for our internal demand reporting. Estimated End-User Demand The following tables set forth for each of our key products sold in the U.S. for the years ended December 31, 2010, 2009 and 2008: (i) total U.S. net sales for each year; (ii) change in reported U.S. net sales for each year; (iii) estimated total U.S. prescription change for the retail and mail order channels calculated by us based on third-party data on a weighted-average basis, and (iv) months of inventory on hand in the wholesale distribution channel.

The months on hand relates only to SUSTIVA. (b) ERBITUX*, IXEMPRA and ORENCIA are parenterally administered products and do not have prescription-level data as physicians do not write prescriptions for these products. (c) ONGLYZA was launched in the U.S. in August 2009. KOMBIGLYZE was launched in the U.S. in the fourth quarter of 2010. * ONGLYZA had 0.5 month of inventory on hand at December 31, 2010. KOMBIGLYZE had 51.8 months of inventory on hand at December 31, 2010 to support the initial product launch. ** Change in excess of 200%. Pursuant to the U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC) Consent Order described below under SEC Consent Order , we monitor the level of inventory on hand in the U.S. wholesaler distribution channel and outside of the U.S. in the direct customer distribution channel. We are obligated to disclose products with levels of inventory in excess of one month on hand or expected demand, subject to a de minimis exception. Below are U.S. products that had estimated levels of inventory in the distribution channel in excess of one month on hand at December 31, 2010, and international products that had estimated levels of inventory in the distribution channel in excess of one month on hand at September 30, 2010. KOMBIGLYZE had 51.8 months of inventory on hand in the U.S. to support the initial product launch. This inventory is nominal and is expected to be worked down in less than that amount of time as demand for this new product increases post launch. DAFALGAN, an analgesic product sold principally in Europe, had 1.2 months of inventory on hand at direct customers compared to 0.9 months of inventory on hand at December 31, 2009. The level of inventory on hand was primarily due to the September launch of a new dosage in France. FERVEX, a cold and flu product, had 2.3 months of inventory on hand internationally at direct customers compared to 3.9 months of inventory on hand at December 31, 2009. The level of inventory on hand was primarily due to lower than expected demand. 52 Table of Contents VIDEX, an antiviral product, had 1.5 months of inventory on hand internationally at direct customers compared to 1.3 months of inventory on hand at December 31, 2009. The level of inventory on hand was primarily due to government purchasing patterns in Brazil. PRINCIPEN, an antibiotic product, had 1.3 months of inventory on hand at direct customers compared to a 0.8 months of inventory on hand at December 31, 2009. The increased level of inventory is due to lower demand from the re-enforcement of antibiotic law in Mexico which requires prescriptions for antibiotics. In the U.S., for all products sold exclusively through wholesalers or through distributors, we generally determined our months on hand estimates using inventory levels of product on hand and the amount of out-movement provided by our three largest wholesalers, which account for approximately 90% of total gross sales of U.S. products, and provided by our distributors. Factors that may influence our estimates include generic competition, seasonality of products, wholesaler purchases in light of increases in wholesaler list prices, new product launches, new warehouse openings by wholesalers and new customer stockings by wholesalers. In addition, these estimates are calculated using third-party data, which may be impacted by their recordkeeping processes. For our businesses outside of the U.S., we have significantly more direct customers. Limited information on direct customer product level inventory and corresponding out-movement information and the reliability of third-party demand information, where available, varies widely. In cases where direct customer product level inventory, ultimate patient/consumer demand or out-movement data does not exist or is otherwise not available, we have developed a variety of other methodologies to estimate such data, including using such factors as historical sales made to direct customers and third-party market research data related to prescription trends and end-user demand. Accordingly, we rely on a variety of methods to estimate direct customer product level inventory and to calculate months on hand. Factors that may affect our estimates include generic competition, seasonality of products, direct customer purchases in light of price increases, new product launches, new warehouse openings by direct customers, new customer stockings by direct customers and expected direct customer purchases for governmental bidding situations. As such, all of the information required to estimate months on hand in the direct customer distribution channel for non-U.S. business for the year ended December 31, 2010 is not available prior to the filing of this annual report on Form 10-K. We will disclose any product with levels of inventory in excess of one month on hand or expected demand, subject to a de minimis exception, in the next quarterly report on Form 10-Q. Geographic Areas In general, our products are available in most countries in the world. The largest markets are in the U.S., France, Canada, Japan, Italy, Spain, Germany, China and the United Kingdom. Our net sales by geographic areas, based on the location of the end customer, were as follows: Net Sales % Change % of Total Net Sales Dollars in Millions 2010 2009 2008 2010 vs. 2009 2009 vs. 2008 2010 2009 2008 United States $ 12,613 $ 11,867 $ 10,565 6 % 12 % 65 % 63 % 60 % Europe 3,448 3,625 3,750 (5 )% (3 )% 18 % 19 % 21 % Japan, Asia Pacific and Canada 1,651 1,522 1,519 8 % 8 % 8 % 8 % Latin America, the Middle East and Africa 856 843 1,047 2 % (19 )% 4 % 5 % 6 % Emerging Markets 804 753 725 7 % 4 % 4 % 4 % 4 % Other 112 198 109 (43 )% 82 % 1 % 1 % 1 % Total $ 19,484 $ 18,808 $ 17,715 4 % 6 % 100 % 100 % 100 % See Net Sales above for a discussion on U.S. net sales increase. Net sales in Europe decreased in 2010 primarily due to a 4% unfavorable foreign exchange impact, decreased net sales of certain mature brands due to divestitures and increased generic competition for PLAVIX* and AVAPRO*/AVALIDE*, partially offset by sales growth in major European markets for ABILIFY*, the HIV portfolio, BARACLUDE, SPRYCEL, ONGLYZA and ORENCIA. The sales growth of the previously mentioned products was tempered by continuing fiscal challenges in European countries as healthcare payers, including government agencies, have reduced and are expected to continue to reduce the cost of healthcare through actions that directly or indirectly impose additional price reductions and support the expanded use of generic drugs. These measures include, but are not limited to, mandatory discounts, rebates and other price reductions and are reflected in our net sales. In 2009, net sales decreased primarily due to a 7% unfavorable foreign exchange impact, decreased net sales of certain mature brands due to divestitures and increased generic competition for PLAVIX*, partially offset by sales growth in major European markets for the HIV portfolio, ABILIFY*, BARACLUDE, SPRYCEL and ORENCIA. Net sales in Japan, Asia Pacific and Canada increased in 2010 primarily due to a 9% favorable foreign exchange impact and increased net sales of BARACLUDE and SPRYCEL partially offset by decreased net sales of certain mature brands due to divestitures and generic competition. In 2009, net sales remained relatively flat as decreased net sales of certain mature brands and a 1% unfavorable foreign exchange impact was offset by increased net sales of BARACLUDE and SPRYCEL. 53 Table of Contents Net sales in Latin America, the Middle East and Africa increased in 2010 primarily due to increased net sales of SPRYCEL, REYATAZ, BARACLUDE, ORENCIA and a 2% favorable foreign exchange impact, partially offset by decreased net sales of mature brands. In 2009, net sales decreased primarily due to a 6% unfavorable foreign exchange impact and decreased net sales of certain mature brands, partially offset by increased net sales of REYATAZ, ORENCIA and PLAVIX*. Emerging markets are Brazil, Russia, India, China and Turkey. Net sales in Emerging Markets increased in 2010 primarily due to a 4% favorable foreign exchange impact and increased net sales of BARACLUDE, SPRYCEL, ABILIFY* and REYATAZ. In 2009, net sales increased primarily due to increased net sales of BARACLUDE and SPRYCEL partially offset by an 8% unfavorable foreign exchange impact. Other consists primarily of sales from supply agreements for active pharmaceutical ingredients, including temporary supply agreements to facilitate recent divestitures of manufacturing facilities and continuing supply agreements with alliance partners. Net sales decreased in 2010 primarily due to the wind-down of temporary supply agreements related to 2009 manufacturing facility divestitures, the elimination of bulk sales of pharmaceutical ingredients previously manufactured by us in the Latina Italy facility which was divested in 2010 and reduced sales of irbesartan bulk pharmaceutical ingredients to our alliance partner due to declining worldwide AVAPRO*/AVALIDE* sales. Net sales increased in 2009 primarily due to temporary supply agreements entered into to facilitate the divestiture of certain manufacturing facilities in Pakistan, Egypt and Australia. No single country outside the U.S. contributed more than 10% of our total net sales in 2010, 2009 or 2008.

Cost of products sold Cost of products sold consist of material costs, internal labor and overhead of our owned manufacturing sites, third-party processing costs, other supply chain costs and changes in foreign currency forward contracts that offset manufacturing related assets and liabilities denominated in foreign currencies. Essentially all of these costs are managed primarily through our global manufacturing organization, referred to as Technical Operations. In addition, discovery royalties attributed to licensed products in connection with alliances as well as the amortization of milestone payments that occur on or after regulatory approval are also included. Costs as a percentage of net sales can vary between periods as a result of product mix, price, inflation and costs attributed to the rationalization of manufacturing sites resulting in accelerated depreciation, impairment charges and other stranded costs. In addition, changes in foreign currency may also provide volatility given a high percentage of total costs are denominated in foreign currencies. The decrease in costs of products sold as a percentage of net sales in 2010 was primarily attributed to a more favorable product mix, U.S. price increases and favorable foreign exchange which was partially offset by the reduction in our share of ABILIFY* sales related to the extended commercialization and manufacturing agreement for ABILIFY*and the collaboration fee paid to Otsuka under the SPRYCEL and IXEMPRA Oncology collaboration beginning in 2010, additional Medicare rebates granted in 2010 from U.S. healthcare reform and international price decreases related to government austerity measures from the European economic crisis. The improvement in cost of products sold as a percentage of net sales in 2009 was driven by favorable foreign exchange, higher U.S. average net selling prices, a more favorable product mix and realized manufacturing efficiencies from PTI offset by higher manufacturing costs attributed to inflation. The 2009 costs include manufacturing rationalization charges of $123 million primarily related to the implementation of PTI compared to $249 million of rationalization charges recognized in 2008. 54 Table of Contents Marketing, selling and administrative Marketing, selling and administrative expenses consist of employee salary and benefit costs, third-party professional and marketing fees, outsourcing fees, shipping and handling costs and other expenses that are not attributed to product manufacturing costs or research and development expenses. Most of these expenses are managed through regional commercialization functions or global functions such as finance, law, information technology and human resources. The decrease in 2010 was primarily attributed to the reduction in sales related activities of certain key products to coincide with their respective life cycle; prior year impact of a $100 million funding payment made to the BMS foundation; reduction in our ABILIFY* sales force as Otsuka established it own sales force for promotion of ABILIFY*, SPRYCEL and IXEMPRA; reduced project standardization implementation costs from the 2009 role out of new accounting and human resource related systems; and overall efficiencies gained from PTI and continuous improvement initiatives. The decrease in 2009 resulted from a favorable 2% foreign exchange impact and efficiencies gained from PTI. Advertising and product promotion Advertising and product promotion expenses consist of related media, sample and direct to consumer programs. The decrease in 2010 was primarily attributed to reduced spending on the promotion of certain key products to coincide with their product life cycle and Otsuka reimbursement of certain ABILIFY*, SPRYCEL and IXEMPRA advertising and product promotion expenses partially offset by increased spending for the ONGLYZA launch and other pipeline products. The decrease in 2009 is attributed to reduced spending on promotion of products nearing patent expirations and a favorable 2% foreign exchange impact, partially offset by increased spending for the ONGLYZA launch and pipeline products. Research and development Research and development expenses consist of internal salary and benefit costs, third-party grants and fees paid to clinical research organizations, supplies and facility costs. Total research and development expenses include the costs of discovery research, preclinical development, early- and late-clinical development and drug formulation, as well as clinical trials and medical support of marketed products, proportionate allocations of enterprise-wide costs, and other appropriate costs. These expenses also include third-party licensing fees that are typically paid upfront as well as when regulatory or other contractual milestones are met. Certain expenses are shared with alliance partners based upon contractual agreements. Approximately 80% of these expenses are managed by our global research and development organization of which, approximately 75% of the total spend was attributed to development activities with the remainder attributed to preclinical and research activities. These expenses can vary between periods for a number of reasons, including the timing of upfront licensing and milestone payments. The decrease in 2010 was primarily attributed to the timing of our upfront licensing and milestone payments partially offset by additional spending to support our maturing pipeline and compounds obtained from our string-of-pearls strategy. Upfront licensing and milestone payments expensed to research and development were $132 million in 2010 primarily attributed to Exelixis, Allergan and PDL BioPharma Inc.; $347 million in 2009 primarily attributed to ZymoGenetics, Alder and Nissan; and $348 million in 2008 primarily attributed to Exelixis, PDL BioPharma, Inc. and KAI Pharmaceuticals, Inc. The increase in 2009 was attributed to additional spending to support our maturing pipeline and compounds obtained from our string-of-pearls strategy, offset by a favorable 1% foreign exchange impact. Acquired in-process research and development The charge related to the acquisition of Kosan Biosciences, Inc. (Kosan) in 2008. Provision for restructuring The changes in provision for restructuring were primarily attributable to the timing of the implementation of certain PTI and continuous improvement initiatives. Litigation expense, net The 2010 amount includes a $41 million insurance reimbursement from prior litigation partially offset by additional reserves established for certain average wholesale prices (AWP) litigation. The 2009 expense was primarily due to a $125 million securities litigation settlement. For further information, see Item 8. Financial Statements Note 26. Legal Proceedings and Contingencies. Equity in net income of affiliates Equity in net income of affiliates was primarily related to our international partnership with sanofi and varies based on international PLAVIX* net sales included within this partnership. The decrease in 2010 and 2009 is attributed to the impact of an alternative salt form of clopidogrel and generic clopidogrel competition on international PLAVIX* net sales commencing in 2009. For additional information, see Item 8. Financial Statements Note 2. Alliances and Collaborations. 55 Table of Contents Gain on sale of ImClone shares The gain on sale of ImClone shares in 2008 was attributed to our receipt of approximately $1.0 billion in cash for the tendering of our investment in ImClone. See Item 8. Financial Statements Note 2. Alliances and Collaborations for further detail. Other (income)/expense Other (income)/expense include: Year Ended December 31, Dollars in Millions 2010 2009 2008 Interest expense $ 145 $ 184 $ 310 Interest income (75 ) (54 ) (130 ) Impairment and loss on sale of manufacturing operations 236 Loss/(Gain) on debt repurchase 6 (7 ) (57 ) ARS impairment 305 Net foreign exchange transaction (gains)/losses (6 ) 2 (78 ) Gain on sale of product lines, businesses and assets (39 ) (360 ) (159 ) Acquisition related items 10 (10 ) Other income from alliance partners (136 ) (148 ) (141 ) Pension curtailment and settlement charges 28 43 8 Other (43 ) (31 ) (36 ) Other (income)/expense $ 126 $ (381 ) $ 22 Interest expense decreased year over year primarily due to lower overall interest rates on floating rate debt, amortization resulting from the termination of interest rate swaps during 2010 and 2009, and less debt outstanding from 2010 and 2009 repurchases. Interest income increased in 2010 primarily due to higher average cash, cash equivalents and marketable securities balances and higher returns from the continued diversification of our investment portfolio. Interest income decreased in 2009 primarily due to lower interest rates compared to 2008 partially offset by higher average cash, cash equivalents and marketable securities balances. Impairment and loss on sale of manufacturing operations was primarily attributed to the disposal of our manufacturing operations in Latina, Italy. See Item 1. Financial Statements Note 4. Restructuring. Auction rate securities (ARS) impairment charge recognized in 2008 was due to the severity and the duration of the decline in value, the future prospects of the issuers and our ability and intent to hold the securities to recover their value. The value of ARS at December 31, 2010 was $91 million. The impact of foreign exchange was mainly due to foreign exchange hedges that were discontinued or did not qualify as cash flow hedges. The 2010 net foreign exchange transaction loss includes a $17 million charge from the remeasurement of Venezuelan monetary assets from the devaluation of the Bolivar. The 2008 net foreign exchange gain was primarily due to the sudden, dramatic strengthening of the U.S. dollar in the second half of 2008, which generated significant gains on foreign currency denominated transactions. See Item 8. Financial Statements Note 24. Financial Instruments. Gain on sale of product lines, businesses and assets was primarily related to the sale of mature brands, including businesses within Indonesia and Australia in 2009 and a business in Egypt in 2008. Acquisition related items are attributed to the acquisition of ZymoGenetics in 2010 and Medarex in 2009. See Item 1. Financial Statements Note 5. Acquisitions. Other income from alliance partners includes income earned from the sanofi partnership and amortization of certain upfront licensing and milestone receipts related to our alliances. Pension settlements/curtailments were primarily attributed to amendments which eliminated the crediting of future benefits related to service for U.S. pension plan participants. These amendments resulted in a curtailment charge of $6 million and $25 million during 2010 and 2009, respectively. The remainder of the charges resulted from lump sum payments in certain plans which exceeded the sum of plan interest costs and service costs, resulting in an acceleration of a portion of previously deferred actuarial losses. Although most of this activity was driven by PTI and certain divestitures, additional charges may be recognized in the future, particularly with the U.S. pension plans due to a lower threshold resulting from the elimination of service costs. See Item 8. Financial Statements Note 21. Pension, Postretirement and Postemployment Liabilities for further detail. 56 Table of Contents Specified Items During 2010, 2009 and 2008, the following specified items affected the comparability of results of the periods presented herein.

This information is intended to enhance an investor overall understanding of our past financial performance and prospects for the future. For example, non-GAAP earnings and EPS information is an indication of our baseline performance before items that are considered by us to not be reflective of our ongoing results. In addition, this information is among the primary indicators we use as a basis for evaluating performance, allocating resources, setting incentive compensation targets, and planning and forecasting of future periods. This information is not intended to be considered in isolation or as a substitute for net earnings or diluted EPS prepared in accordance with GAAP. Among the items in GAAP measures but excluded for purposes of determining adjusted earnings and other adjusted measures are: charges related to implementation of the PTI; gains or losses from the purchase or sale of businesses, product lines or investments; discontinued operations; restructuring and other exit costs; accelerated depreciation charges; asset impairments; charges and recoveries relating to significant legal proceedings; upfront licensing and milestone payments for in-licensing of products that have not achieved regulatory approval that are immediately expensed; IPRD charges prior to 2009; special initiative funding to the Bristol-Myers Squibb Foundation; and significant tax events. For a detailed listing of items that are excluded from the non-GAAP earnings from continuing operations, see Specified Items above. Similar charges or gains for some of these items have been recognized in prior periods and it is reasonably possible that they will reoccur in future periods. 58 Table of Contents A reconciliation of GAAP to non-GAAP follows: Year Ended December 31, 2010 Year Ended December 31, 2009 Dollars in Millions, except per share data GAAP Specified Items Non-GAAP GAAP Specified Items Non-GAAP Net Earnings from Continuing Operations Attributable to BMS $ 3,102 $ 633 $ 3,735 $ 3,239 $ 428 $ 3,667 Earnings attributable to unvested restricted shares (12 ) (12 ) (17 ) (17 ) Net Earnings from Continuing Operations Attributable to BMS used for Diluted EPS Calculation $ 3,090 $ 633 $ 3,723 $ 3,222 $ 428 $ 3,650 Average Common Shares Outstanding Diluted 1,727 1,727 1,978 1,978 Diluted EPS from Continuing Operations Attributable to BMS $ 1.79 $ 0.37 $ 2.16 $ 1.63 $ 0.22 $ 1.85 Income Taxes The effective income tax rate on earnings from continuing operations before income taxes was 25.7% in 2010, 21.1% in 2009 and 22.8% in 2008. The effective income tax rate is lower than the U.S. statutory rate of 35% due to our decision to permanently reinvest the earnings for certain of our manufacturing operations in Ireland, Puerto Rico and Switzerland offshore and the U.S. Federal research and development tax credit. We have favorable tax rates in Ireland and Puerto Rico under grants not scheduled to expire prior to 2023. The increase in the 2010 effective tax rate from 2009 was primarily due to a $207 million tax charge recognized in the fourth quarter of 2010, which resulted from additional U.S. taxable income from earnings of foreign subsidiaries previously considered to be permanently reinvested offshore. For additional information, see Item 8. Financial Statements Note 10. Income Taxes. Discontinued Operations On December 23, 2009, we completed a split-off of our remaining interest in Mead Johnson by means of an exchange offer to BMS shareholders. In August 2008, we completed the divestiture of our ConvaTec business to Cidron Healthcare Limited, an affiliate of Nordic Capital Fund VII and Avista Capital Partners L.P. (Avista). In January 2008, we completed the divestiture of Bristol-Myers Squibb Medical Imaging (Medical Imaging) to Avista. See Item 8. Financial Statements Note 7. Discontinued Operations. Noncontrolling Interest Noncontrolling interest is primarily related to our partnerships with sanofi for the territory covering the Americas related to PLAVIX* net sales. See Item 8. Financial Statements Note 2. Alliances and Collaborations. The increase in noncontrolling interest corresponds to increased net sales of PLAVIX* in the U.S. Net earnings from discontinued operations attributable to noncontrolling interest primarily relates to the 16.9% publicly owned portion of Mead Johnson prior to our complete divestiture from the split-off. A summary of noncontrolling interest is as follows: Year Ended December 31, Dollars in Millions 2010 2009 2008 sanofi partnerships $ 2,074 $ 1,717 $ 1,444 Other 20 26 17 Noncontrolling interest pre-tax 2,094 1,743 1,461 Income taxes (683 ) (562 ) (472 ) Net earnings from continuing operations attributable to noncontrolling interest net of taxes 1,411 1,181 989 Net earnings from discontinued operations attributable to noncontrolling interest net of taxes 69 7 Net earnings attributable to noncontrolling interest net of taxes $ 1,411 $ 1,250 $ 996 59 Table of Contents Financial Position, Liquidity and Capital Resources Net cash position at December 31 was as follows: Dollars in Millions 2010 2009 Cash and cash equivalents $ 5,033 $ 7,683 Marketable securities current 2,268 831 Marketable securities non-current 2,681 1,369 Total cash, cash equivalents and marketable securities 9,982 9,883 Short-term borrowings, including current portion of long-term debt 117 231 Long-term debt 5,328 6,130 Total debt 5,445 6,361 Net cash position $ 4,537 $ 3,522 We maintain a significant level of working capital, which was approximately $6.5 billion at December 31, 2010 and $7.6 billion at December 31, 2009. In 2010, we paid $2.2 billion in dividends, reacquired $750 million aggregate principal value of our outstanding debt for $855 million by means of a tender offer, acquired ZymoGenetics for $829 million, and repurchased $576 million of common stock. In 2011 and future periods, we expect cash generated by our U.S. operations, together with existing cash, cash equivalents, marketable securities and borrowings from the capital markets, to be sufficient to cover cash needs for working capital, capital expenditures, strategic alliances and acquisitions, milestone payments, dividends paid in the U.S. and common stock and debt repurchases. We do not rely on short-term borrowing to meet our liquidity needs. Cash, cash equivalents and marketable securities held outside the U.S. was approximately $1.4 billion and $5.3 billion at December 31, 2010 and 2009, respectively, which is either utilized to fund non-U.S. operations or repatriated back to the U.S. where taxes have been previously provided. Cash repatriations are subject to restrictions in certain jurisdictions and may be subject to withholding and other taxes. Cash, cash equivalents and marketable securities held in the U.S. was $8.6 billion at December 31, 2010, which represented approximately 85% of our total balance. Cash, cash equivalents and marketable securities held in the U.S. was $4.6 billion at December 31, 2009. The increase resulted from an internal restructuring of certain legal entities. We diversified our investment portfolio and acquired non-current marketable securities, including purchases of corporate debt securities. These investments are subject to changes in fair value as a result of interest rate fluctuations and other market factors, which may impact our results of operations. Our investment policy places limits on these investments and the amount and time to maturity of investments with any institution. The policy also requires that investments are only made with highly rated corporate and financial institutions. See Item 8. Financial Statements Note 12. Cash, Cash Equivalents and Marketable Securities. We continue to monitor the potential impact of the deteriorating economic conditions in certain European countries further discussed in Geographic Areas above and the related impact on prescription trends, pricing discounts, creditworthiness of our customers, and our ability to collect outstanding receivables from such countries. Currently, we believe these conditions will not have a material impact on our liquidity, cash flow, or financial flexibility. We have a $2.0 billion five year revolving credit facility from a syndicate of lenders maturing in December 2011, which is extendable with the consent of the lenders. The facility contains customary terms and conditions, including a financial covenant whereby the ratio of consolidated net debt to consolidated capital cannot exceed 50% at the end of each quarter. We have been in compliance with this covenant since the inception of the facility. There were no borrowings outstanding under the facility at December 31, 2010 and 2009. As an additional source of liquidity, we sell trade accounts receivables, principally from non-U.S. governments and hospital customers primarily in Japan, Italy, Portugal and Spain, to third parties. The receivables are sold on a nonrecourse basis and approximated $932 million and $660 million in 2010 and 2009, respectively. Our sales agreements do not allow for recourse in the event of uncollectibility and we do not retain interest to the underlying asset once sold. Credit Ratings Moody Investors Service (Moody s) long-term and short-term credit ratings are currently A2 and Prime-1, respectively, and their long-term credit outlook remains on stable outlook. Standard & Poor (S&P) long-term and short-term credit ratings are currently A+ and A-1, respectively, and their long-term credit rating remains on stable outlook. Fitch Ratings (Fitch) long-term and short-term credit ratings are currently A+ and F1, respectively, and their long-term credit rating changed in August 2010 from stable to negative outlook. Our credit ratings are considered investment grade. These long-term ratings designate that we have a low default risk but are somewhat susceptible to adverse effects of changes in circumstances and economic conditions. These short-term ratings designate that we have the strongest capacity for timely repayment. 60 Table of Contents Cash Flows The following is a discussion of cash flow activities at December 31: Dollars in Millions 2010 2009 2008 Cash flow provided by/(used in): Operating activities $ 4,491 $ 4,065 $ 3,707 Investing activities (3,812 ) (4,380 ) 5,079 Financing activities (3,343 ) (17 ) (2,582 ) Operating Activities Cash flows from operating activities represent the cash receipts and cash disbursements related to all of our activities other than investing activities and financing activities. Operating cash flow is derived by adjusting net earnings for: Noncontrolling interest; Non-cash operating items such as depreciation and amortization, impairment charges and stock-based compensation charges; Gains and losses attributed to investing and financing activities such as gains and losses on the sale of product lines and businesses; and Changes in operating assets and liabilities which reflect timing differences between the receipt and payment of cash associated with transactions and when they are recognized in results of operations. The net impact of the changes in operating assets and liabilities aggregated to a net cash outflow of $166 million in 2010 and cash inflows of $42 million in 2009 and $117 million in 2008. These items included the impact of changes in receivables, inventories, deferred income, accounts payable, income taxes receivable/payable and other operating assets and liabilities which are discussed in more detail below. We continue to maximize our operating cash flows with our working capital initiatives designed to improve working capital items that are most directly affected by changes in sales volume, such as receivables, inventories and accounts payable. Those improvements are being driven by several actions including non-recourse factoring of non-US trade receivables, revised contractual payment terms with customers and vendors, enhanced collection processes and various supply chain initiatives designed to optimize inventory levels. Progress in this area is monitored each period and is a component of our annual incentive plan. The following summarizes certain working capital components expressed as a percentage of trailing twelve months net sales. Dollars in Millions December 31, 2010 % of Trailing Twelve Month Net Sales December 31, 2009 % of Trailing Twelve Month Net Sales Net trade receivables $ 1,985 10.2 % $ 1,897 10.1 % Inventories 1,204 6.2 % 1,413 7.5 % Accounts payable (1,983 ) (10.2 )% (1,711 ) (9.1 )% Total $ 1,206 6.2 % $ 1,599 8.5 % During 2010, changes in operating assets and liabilities aggregated to a net cash outflow of $166 million including: Cash outflows from receivables ($270 million) which are primarily attributed to increased sales; Cash outflows from other operating assets and liabilities ($248 million) primarily related to pension funding in excess of current year expense ($370 million), partially offset by increased rebate and sales returns ($238 million) primarily due to the increase in Medicaid rebates which was effective January 1, 2010 and agencies administrative delays in payments to managed care organizations; Cash inflows from accounts payables ($315 million) which are primarily attributed to the timing of vendor and alliance payments; and Cash inflows from inventories ($156 million) primarily related to the work down of inventory balances. In 2009, changes in operating assets and liabilities aggregated to a net cash inflow of $42 million including: Cash inflows from accounts payable ($472 million) primarily attributed to the timing of payments to vendors and alliances, as well as the impact of the working capital initiative discussed above; Cash inflows from receivables ($227 million) primarily attributed to additional factoring of non-U.S. trade receivables in Japan and Spain; Cash inflows from deferred income ($135 million) mainly due to the milestone payments received from Pfizer ($150 million) and AstraZeneca ($150 million), partially offset by amortization; and 61 Table of Contents Cash outflows from other operating assets and liabilities ($932 million) primarily related to pension funding in excess of current year expense ($532 million), and a payment to Otsuka which is amortized as a reduction of net sales through the extension period ($400 million). In 2008, changes in operating assets aggregated to a net cash inflow of $117 million including: Cash inflows from income tax payable/receivable ($371 million) which includes the impact of the receipt of a $432 million tax refund, including interest, related to a prior year foreign tax credit carryback claim; Cash inflows from accounts payables ($253 million) which are primarily attributed to the timing of vendor and alliance payments; Cash inflows from inventory ($130 million) which is primarily attributed to the utilization of inventories which were built up in the prior year for new product launches and strategic builds for existing products launches including for new indications of ABILIFY*; Cash inflows from deferred income ($61 million) which are primarily due to receipt of upfront licensing and milestone payments from alliance partners; Cash outflows from accounts receivables ($360 million) which are attributed to increased sales; and Cash outflows from other operating assets and liabilities ($338 million) which are primarily due to net litigation related payments ($190 million) attributed to the settlement of certain pricing and sales litigation accrued in prior periods; pension funding in excess of current year expense ($120 million); and increase in non-current inventory ($112 million). Investing Activities Net cash used in investing activities was $3.8 billion in 2010 including: Net purchases of marketable securities ($2.6 billion); Purchase of ZymoGenetics, Inc. ($829 million); and Capital expenditures ($424 million). Net cash used in investing activities was $4.4 billion in 2009 including: Acquisition of Medarex ($2.2 billion), net of cash acquired ($53 million); Net purchases of marketable securities ($1.4 billion); Capital expenditures ($730 million); Mead Johnson cash included in split-off ($561 million); and Proceeds from the sale of businesses and other investments, including businesses within the Asia-Pacific region ($310 million) and Australia ($61 million); and proceeds from the sale of Genmab and Celldex securities ($42 million). Net cash provided by investing activities was $5.1 billion in 2008 including: Proceeds from the divestiture of ConvaTec ($4.1 billion) and Medical Imaging ($483 million); Proceeds from the tendering of our shares in ImClone ($1.0 billion); Proceeds from the sale and leaseback of the Paris, France facility ($227 million); Proceeds from the sale of businesses, including mature brands business in Egypt ($209 million); Capital expenditures ($941 million) which included expenditures associated with the construction of our biologic facility in Devens, Massachusetts; and Acquisition of Kosan ($191 million). Financing Activities Net cash used in financing activities was $3.3 billion in 2010 including: Dividend payments ($2.2 billion); Debt repurchase by means of a tender offer ($855 million); and Common stock repurchase ($576 million); Net proceeds from the exercise of stock options ($252 million); and Net proceeds from the termination of interest rate swap agreements ($146 million). 62 Table of Contents Net cash used in financing activities was $17 million in 2009 including: Dividend payments ($2.5 billion); Repayment of Mead Johnson revolving credit facility ($80 million) and the early extinguishment of certain debt securities ($132 million); Net proceeds from the issuance of Mead Johnson Notes ($1.5 billion) and revolving credit facility ($200 million); Net proceeds from the Mead Johnson IPO ($782 million); Net proceeds from the termination of interest rate swap agreements ($194 million); and Net proceeds from the exercise of stock options ($45 million). Net cash used in financing activities was $2.6 billion in 2008 including: Dividend payments ($2.5 billion); Redemption of Floating Rate Convertible Senior Debentures due 2023 ($1.2 billion); Repayment of 4.00% Notes due August 2008 ($400 million) and 1.10% Yen Notes due 2008 ($117 million); Repurchase of some of our Notes ($228 million); Net proceeds from the issuance of 5.45% Notes due 2018 ($600 million) and 6.125% Notes due 2038 ($1.0 billion); Net proceeds from the termination of interest rate swap agreements ($211 million); and Net proceeds from stock option exercises in 2008 ($5 million) reflects the exercise of fewer stock options in 2008 due to the decrease in the average stock price when compared to the prior periods. Dividends declared per common share were $1.29 for 2010, $1.25 for 2009 and $1.24 for 2008. In December 2010, we declared a quarterly dividend of $0.33 per common share and expect to pay a dividend for the full year of 2011 of $1.32 per share. The decrease in total dividends, despite the per share increase, is primarily attributed to the 269 million share reduction from the Mead Johnson split-off. Dividend decisions are made on a quarterly basis by our Board of Directors. 63 Table of Contents Contractual Obligations Payments due by period for our contractual obligations at December 31, 2010 were as follows: Obligations Expiring by Period Dollars in Millions Total 2011 2012 2013 2014 2015 Later Years Short-term borrowings $ 117 $ 117 $ $ $ $ $ Long-term debt 4,749 597 4,152 Interest on long-term debt (a) 4,860 155 177 202 205 226 3,895 Operating leases 661 123 113 101 89 77 158 Purchase obligations 2,322 665 486 482 281 157 251 Uncertain tax positions (b) 50 50 Other long-term liabilities 370 36 63 41 35 195 Total (c) $ 13,129 $ 1,110 $ 812 $ 1,445 $ 616 $ 495 $ 8,651 (a) Includes estimated future interest payments on our short-term and long-term debt securities. Also includes accrued interest payable recognized on our consolidated balance sheets, which consists primarily of the accrual of interest on short-term and long-term debt as well as the accrual of periodic cash settlements of derivatives, netted by counterparty. (b) Due to the uncertainty related to the timing of the reversal of uncertain tax positions, only the short-term uncertain tax benefits have been provided in the table above. See Item 8. Financial Statements Note 10. Income Taxes for further detail. (c) The table above excludes future contributions by us to our pensions, postretirement and postemployment benefit plans. Required contributions are contingent upon numerous factors including minimum regulatory funding requirements and the funded status of each plan. Due to the uncertainty of such future obligations, they are excluded from the table. Contributions for both U.S. and international plans are expected to be up to $420 million in 2011. See Item 8. Financial Statements Note 21. Pension, Postretirement and Postemployment Liabilities for further detail. In addition to the above, we are committed to approximately $5.4 billion (in the aggregate) of potential future research and development milestone payments to third parties as part of in-licensing and development programs. Early stage milestones, defined as milestones achieved through Phase III clinical trials, comprised $1.0 billion of the total committed amount. Late stage milestones, defined as milestones achieved post Phase III clinical trials, comprised $4.4 billion of the total committed amount. Payments under these agreements generally are due and payable only upon achievement of certain developmental and regulatory milestones, for which the specific timing cannot be predicted. In addition to certain royalty obligations that are calculated as a percentage of net sales, some of these agreements also provide for sales-based milestones that aggregate to approximately $1.5 billion that we would be obligated to pay to alliance partners upon achievement of certain sales levels. For a discussion of contractual obligations, see Item 8. Financial Statements Note 21. Pension, Postretirement and Postemployment Liabilities, Note 23. Short-Term Borrowings and Long-Term Debt, Note 24. Financial Instruments and Note 25. Leases. SEC Consent Order As previously disclosed, on August 4, 2004, we entered into a final settlement with the SEC, concluding an investigation concerning certain wholesaler inventory and accounting matters. The settlement was reached through a Consent, a copy of which was attached as Exhibit 10 to our quarterly report on Form 10-Q for the period ended September 30, 2004. Under the terms of the Consent, we agreed, subject to certain defined exceptions, to limit sales of all products sold to our direct customers (including wholesalers, distributors, hospitals, retail outlets, pharmacies and government purchasers) based on expected demand or on amounts that do not exceed approximately one month of inventory on hand, without making a timely public disclosure of any change in practice. We also agreed in the Consent to certain measures that we have implemented including: (a) establishing a formal review and certification process of our annual and quarterly reports filed with the SEC; (b) establishing a business risk and disclosure group; (c) retaining an outside consultant to comprehensively study and help re-engineer our accounting and financial reporting processes; (d) publicly disclosing any sales incentives offered to direct customers for the purpose of inducing them to purchase products in excess of expected demand; and (e) ensuring that our budget process gives appropriate weight to inputs that come from the bottom to the top, and not just from the top to the bottom, and adequately documenting that process. We have established a company-wide policy to limit our sales to direct customers for the purpose of complying with the Consent. This policy includes the adoption of various procedures to monitor and limit sales to direct customers in accordance with the terms of the Consent. These procedures include a governance process to escalate to appropriate management levels potential questions or concerns regarding compliance with the policy and timely resolution of such questions or concerns. In addition, compliance with the policy is monitored on a regular basis. We maintain inventory management agreements (IMAs) with our U.S. pharmaceutical wholesalers, which account for nearly 100% of total gross sales of U.S. biopharmaceuticals products. Under the current terms of the IMAs, our wholesaler customers provide us with weekly information with respect to months on hand product-level inventories and the amount of out-movement of products. The three 64 Table of Contents largest wholesalers currently account for approximately 90% of total gross sales of U.S. BioPharmaceuticals products. The inventory information received from our wholesalers, together with our internal information, is used to estimate months on hand product level inventories at these wholesalers. We estimate months on hand product inventory levels for our U.S. BioPharmaceuticals business wholesaler customers other than the three largest wholesalers by extrapolating from the months on hand calculated for the three largest wholesalers. In contrast, for our biopharmaceuticals business outside of the U.S., we have significantly more direct customers, limited information on direct customer product level inventory and corresponding out-movement information and the reliability of third-party demand information, where available, varies widely. Accordingly, we rely on a variety of methods to estimate months on hand product level inventories for these business units. We believe the above-described procedures provide a reasonable basis to ensure compliance with the Consent. Recently Issued Accounting Standards See Item 8. Financial Statements Note 1. Accounting Policies for discussion of the impact related to recently issued accounting standards. Critical Accounting Policies We prepare our financial statements in conformity with accounting principles generally accepted in the U.S. The preparation of financial statements in conformity with U.S. generally accepted accounting principles (GAAP) requires the use of estimates and assumptions that affect the reported amounts of assets and liabilities, including disclosure of contingent assets and contingent liabilities, at the date of the financial statements and the reported amounts of revenue and expenses during the reporting period. Our critical accounting policies are those that are both most important to our financial condition and results of operations and require the most difficult, subjective or complex judgments on the part of management in their application, often as a result of the need to make estimates about the effect of matters that are inherently uncertain. New discounts under the 2010 U.S. healthcare reform law, such as the Medicare coverage gap, managed Medicaid and expansion of the Public Health Service 340B program require additional assumptions due to the lack of historical claims experience. In addition, the new pharmaceutical company fee estimate is subject to external data as well as a calculation based on the Company relative share of industry results. Because of the uncertainty of factors surrounding the estimates or judgments used in the preparation of the consolidated financial statements, actual results may vary from these estimates. These accounting policies were discussed with the Audit Committee of the Board of Directors. Revenue Recognition Our accounting policy for revenue recognition has a substantial impact on reported results and relies on certain estimates that require difficult, subjective and complex judgments on the part of management. We recognize revenue when title and substantially all the risks and rewards of ownership have transferred to the customer, which generally occurs on the date of shipment (net of the gross-to-net sales adjustments discussed below, all of which involve significant estimates and judgments). For discussions on revenue recognition, see Item 8. Financial Statements Note 1. Accounting Policies Revenue Recognition and Sales Rebate and Return Accruals. Gross-to-Net Sales Adjustments We have the following significant categories of gross-to-net sales adjustments: charge-backs, managed healthcare rebates and other contractual discounts, Medicaid rebates, cash discounts, sales returns and other adjustments, all of which involve significant estimates and judgments and require us to use information from external sources. See Net Sales above for a reconciliation of our gross sales to net sales by each significant category of gross-to-net sales adjustment. Charge-backs related to government programs Our U.S. businesses participate in programs with government entities, the most significant of which are the U.S. Department of Defense and the U.S. Department of Veterans Affairs, and other parties, including covered entities under the 340B Drug Pricing Program, whereby pricing on products is extended below wholesaler list price to participating entities. These entities purchase products through wholesalers at the lower program price and the wholesalers then charge us the difference between their acquisition cost and the lower program price. We account for these charge-backs by reducing accounts receivable in an amount equal to our estimate of charge-back claims attributable to a sale. We determine our estimate of these charge-backs primarily based on historical experience regarding these programs charge-backs and current contract prices under the programs. We consider chargeback payments, levels of inventory in the distribution channel, and our claim processing time lag and adjust the reduction to accounts receivable periodically throughout each quarter to reflect actual experience. 65 Table of Contents Cash discounts In the U.S. and certain other countries, we offer cash discounts, generally approximating 2% of the sales price, as an incentive for prompt payment. We account for cash discounts by reducing accounts receivable by the full amount of the discounts. We consider payment performance and adjust the accrual to reflect actual experience. Managed healthcare rebates and other contract discounts We offer rebates and discounts to managed healthcare organizations in the U.S. which manage prescription drug programs and Medicare Advantage prescription drug plans covering the Medicare Part D drug benefit in addition to their commercial plans, as well as globally to other contract counterparties such as hospitals and group purchasing organizations. Beginning in 2011, the rebates for the Medicare Part D program will include a 50% discount on the Company brand-name drugs to patients who fall within the Medicare Part D coverage gap. In addition, we accrue rebates under U.S. Department of Defense TRICARE Retail Pharmacy Refund Program. We account for managed healthcare rebates and other contract discounts by establishing an accrual in an amount equal to our estimate of managed healthcare rebates and other contractual discounts attributable to a sale. We determine our estimate of the managed healthcare rebates and other contractual discounts accrual primarily based on historical experience regarding these rebates and discounts and current contract prices. We consider the sales performance of products subject to managed healthcare rebates and other contract discounts and levels of inventory in the distribution channel and adjust the accrual periodically throughout each quarter to reflect actual experience. Medicaid rebates Our U.S. businesses participate in state government Medicaid programs as well as certain other qualifying Federal and state government programs whereby discounts and rebates are provided to participating state and local government entities. Discounts and rebates provided through these latter programs are included in our Medicaid rebate accrual and are considered Medicaid rebates for the purposes of this discussion. Retroactive to January 1, 2010, minimum rebates on Medicaid drug sales increased from 15.1% to 23.1%. Medicaid rebates have also been extended to drugs used in risk-based Medicaid managed care plans beginning in March 2010. We account for Medicaid rebates by establishing an accrual in an amount equal to our estimate of Medicaid rebate claims attributable to a sale. We determine our estimate of the Medicaid rebates accrual primarily based on historical experience regarding Medicaid rebates, as well as any expansion on a prospective basis of our participation in the non-mandatory aspects of the qualifying Federal and state government programs, legal interpretations of applicable laws related to Medicaid and qualifying Federal and state government programs, and any new information regarding changes in the Medicaid programs regulations and guidelines that would impact the amount of the rebates. We consider outstanding Medicaid claims, Medicaid payments, and levels of inventory in the distribution channel and adjust the accrual periodically throughout each quarter to reflect actual experience. Sales returns We account for sales returns by establishing an accrual in an amount equal to our estimate of sales recognized for which the related products are expected to be returned. For returns of established products, we determine our estimate of the sales return accrual primarily based on historical experience regarding sales returns, but also consider other factors that could impact sales returns. These factors include levels of inventory in the distribution channel, estimated shelf life, product recalls, product discontinuances, price changes of competitive products, introductions of generic products, introductions of competitive new products and instances of expected precipitous declines in demand such as following the loss of exclusivity. We consider all of these factors and adjust the accrual periodically throughout each quarter to reflect actual experience. In the event of a product recall or product discontinuance, we consider the reasons for and impact of such actions and adjust the sales return accrual as appropriate, taking into account historical experience, estimated levels of inventory in the distribution channel and, for product discontinuances, estimates of continuing demand. Sales returns accruals from new products are estimated and primarily based on the historical sales returns experience of similar products, such as those within the same line of product or those within the same or similar therapeutic category. In limited circumstances, where the new product is not an extension of an existing line of product or where we have no historical experience with products in a similar therapeutic category, such that we cannot reliably estimate expected returns of the new product, we defer recognition of revenue until the right of return no longer exists or until we have developed sufficient historical experience to estimate sales returns. We also consider the shelf life of new products and determine whether an adjustment to the sales return accrual is appropriate. The shelf life in connection with new products tends to be shorter than the shelf life for more established products because we may still be developing an optimal manufacturing process for the new product that would lengthen its shelf life. In addition, higher launch quantities may have been manufactured in advance of the launch date to ensure sufficient supply exists to satisfy market demand. In those cases, we assess the reduced shelf life, together with estimated levels of inventory in the distribution channel and projected demand, and determine whether an adjustment to the sales return accrual is appropriate. 66 Table of Contents Pharmaceutical Company Fee (Pharma Fee) Beginning in 2011, we will pay an annual non-tax-deductible fee to the federal government based on an allocation of our market share of branded prior year sales to certain government programs including Medicare, Medicaid, Department of Veterans Affairs, Department of Defense and TRICARE. The 2011 Pharma fee amount will not be finalized until 2012 and preliminary funding in 2011 will be based on information that is on a one-year lag. The Pharma fee is calculated based on market data of the Company as well as other industry participants for which the Company does not have full visibility. This fee will be classified for financial reporting purposes as an operating expense. Other adjustments In addition to the gross-to-net sales adjustments described above, we make other gross-to-net sales adjustments. For example, we offer sales discounts, most significantly in non-U.S. businesses, and also offer consumer coupons and rebates in our U.S. business. In addition, in a number of countries outside the U.S., including certain major European countries, we provide rebates to government entities. We generally account for these other gross-to-net sales adjustments by establishing an accrual in an amount equal to our estimate of the adjustments attributable to a sale. We generally determine our estimates of the accruals for these other gross-to-net sales adjustments primarily based on historical experience, performance on commitments to government entities and other relevant factors, including estimated levels of inventory in the distribution channel, and adjust the accruals periodically throughout each quarter to reflect actual experience. Use of information from external sources We use information from external sources to estimate gross-to-net sales adjustments. Our estimate of inventory at the wholesalers are based on the projected prescription demand-based sales for our products and historical inventory experience, as well as our analysis of third-party information, including written and oral information obtained from certain wholesalers with respect to their inventory levels and sell-through to customers and third-party market research data, and our internal information. The inventory information received from wholesalers is a product of their recordkeeping process and excludes inventory held by intermediaries to whom they sell, such as retailers and hospitals. Effective January 1, 2009, we changed our service provider for U.S. prescription data to WK, a supplier of market research audit data to the pharmaceutical industry, to project the prescription demand-based sales for many U.S. biopharmaceutical products. Prior to 2009, we used prescription data based on the Next-Generation Prescription Service Version 2.0 of the National Prescription Audit provided by IMS. We have also continued the practice of combining retail and mail prescription volume on a retail-equivalent basis. We use this methodology for internal demand forecasts. We also use information from external sources to identify prescription trends, patient demand and average selling prices. Our estimates are subject to inherent limitations of estimates that rely on third-party information, as certain third-party information was itself in the form of estimates, and reflect other limitations including lags between the date as of which third-party information is generated and the date on which we receive third-party information. Retirement Benefits Our pension plans and postretirement benefit plans are accounted for using actuarial valuations. Our key assumptions used in calculating the cost of pension benefits are the discount rate and the expected long-term rate of return on plan assets. In consultation with our actuaries, we evaluate and select these key assumptions and others used in calculating the cost of pension benefits, such as salary growth, retirement, turnover, healthcare trends and mortality rates, based on expectations or actual experience, as appropriate, and determine such assumptions during each remeasurement date including December 31 of each year to calculate liability information as of that date and pension expense for the following year. Depending on the assumptions used, the pension expense could vary within a range of outcomes and have a material effect on reported earnings, projected benefit obligations and future cash funding. Actual results in any given year may differ from those estimated because of economic and other factors. In determining the discount rate, we use the yield on high quality corporate bonds that coincides with the cash flows of the plans estimated payouts. The Citigroup Pension Discount curve is used in determining the discount rate for the U.S. plans. The U.S. plans pension expense for 2010 was determined using a 5.74% weighted-average discount rate. The present value of benefit obligations at December 31, 2010 for the U.S. plans was determined using a 5.25% discount rate. If the discount rate used in determining the U.S. plans pension expense for 2010 had been reduced by 1%, such expense would have increased by approximately $2 million. If the assumed discount rate used in determining the projected benefit obligation at December 31, 2010 had been reduced by 1%, the projected benefit obligation would have increased by approximately $700 million. 67 Table of Contents In determining the expected long-term rate of return on plan assets, we estimate returns for individual asset classes with input from external advisors. We also consider long-term historical returns including actual performance compared to benchmarks for similar investments. The U.S. plans pension expense for 2010 was determined using an 8.75% expected long-term rate of return on plan assets. If the expected long-term rate of return on plan assets used in determining the U.S. plans pension expense for 2010 had been reduced by 1%, such expense would have increased by $40 million. For a more detailed discussion on retirement benefits, see Item 8. Financial Statements Note 21. Pension, Postretirement and Postemployment Liabilities. Business Combinations The consolidated financial statements reflect an acquired business after the completion of an acquisition. Assets acquired and liabilities assumed are recognized at the date of acquisition at their respective fair values. Any excess of the purchase price over the estimated fair values of the net assets acquired is recognized as goodwill. When determining the fair value of intangible assets, including IPRD, we typically use the income method. This method starts with a forecast of all of the expected future net cash flows which are risk adjusted based on estimated probabilities of technical and regulatory success. These cash flows are then adjusted to present value by applying an appropriate discount rate that reflects the risk factors associated with the cash flow streams. Some of the more significant estimates and assumptions inherent in the income method or other methods include: the amount and timing of projected future cash flows; the amount and timing of projected costs to develop the IPRD into commercially viable products; the discount rate selected to measure the risks inherent in the future cash flows; the assessment of the asset life cycle and the competitive trends impacting the asset, including consideration of any technical, legal, regulatory, or economic barriers to entry, as well as expected changes in standards of practice for indications addressed by the asset. For specific intangible assets the following approaches are utilized: IPRD is valued from a market participant view. For those values where we have a pre-existing relationship with the acquiree, we consider the terms of the respective collaboration arrangement including cost and profit sharing splits. The project unit of account is typically a global view and would consider all potential jurisdictions and indications. As of January 1, 2009, acquired IPRD projects are initially capitalized and considered indefinite-lived assets subject to annual impairment reviews or more often upon the occurrence of certain events. For those compounds that reach commercialization, the assets are amortized over the expected useful lives. Prior to January 1, 2009, amounts allocated to acquired IPRD were expensed at the date of acquisition. Technology related to specific platforms is valued based upon the expected annual number of antibodies achieving an early candidate nomination status. Technology for commercial products is valued utilizing the multi-period excess-earnings method of the income approach under the premise that the value of the intangible asset is equal to the present value of the after-tax cash flows solely attributed to the intangible asset. Licenses are valued utilizing a discounted cash flow method utilizing estimates of future risk-adjusted milestone and royalty payments projected to be earned over the respective products estimated economic term. For compounds under development, significant delays in obtaining marketing approval or the inability to bring the respective product to market could result in the related intangible assets to be partially or fully impaired. For commercialized products, the inability to meet sales forecasts could result in the related intangible assets to be partially or fully impaired. Determining the useful life of an intangible asset is based upon the period over which it is expected to contribute to future cash flows. All pertinent matters associated with the asset and the environment for which it operates are considered, including, legal, regulatory or contractual provisions as well as the effects of any obsolescence, demand, competition, and other economic factors. The amortization periods of intangible assets typically are as follows: IPRD Upon commercialization, over the patent life of respective product Licenses Over the term of the respective license arrangement Technology Over the estimated life of technology 68 Table of Contents ZymoGenetics, Inc. Acquisition On October 12, 2010, we acquired ZymoGenetics, Inc. for an aggregate purchase price of $885 million, or $829 million net of cash acquired. See Item 8. Financial Statements Note 5. Acquisitions. The estimated fair value of identifiable intangible assets was $678 million and included: $448 million to IPRD projects of which $310 million was assigned to pegylated-interferon lambda currently in Phase IIb development for the treatment of Hepatitis C, $33 million assigned to a Phase II product, $105 million to licenses attributed to five products under various stages of development. Ultimate realization of the IPRD projects will depend upon successful regulatory approvals, if received, and market factors relevant to a typical biopharmaceutical product. $230 million to technology associated with RECOTHROM, a wholly-owned, commercialized product that has been developed and marketed for use as a topical hemostat to control moderate bleeding during surgical procedures, which is being amortized over a 10 year life. The projected cash flows utilized in the valuation assumed initial positive cash flows to commence shortly after the receipt of expected regulatory approvals, subject to trial results among other things, which, we estimated will not occur for a number of years. The projected cash flows were discounted at 12%. Actual cash flows attributed to the project are likely to be different than those assumed. Medarex, Inc. Acquisition On September 1, 2009, we acquired the remaining outstanding shares of Medarex not already owned by us for approximately $2.3 billion. See Item 8. Financial Statements Note 5. Acquisitions. The estimated fair value of identifiable intangible assets was $1.9 billion and included: $1.5 billion to IPRD of which $1.0 billion was assigned to YERVOY which is a fully human antibody currently in Phase III development for the treatment of metastatic melanoma. In 2010, the FDA accepted for filing and review the Biologics License Application for YERVOY in pre-treated advanced melanoma with a stated action date of March 26, 2011. There is also an ongoing YERVOY Phase II study in lung cancer as well as Phase III studies in adjuvant melanoma and hormone-refractory prostate cancer. Ultimate realization of YERVOY asset value will depend upon successful regulatory approvals, if received, and market factors of a typical biopharmaceutical product. The remaining IPRD was assigned to four other projects that were in Phase II development and 13 other projects at various stages of development that were generated from Medarex technology and are being developed through licensing partners that may generate milestone payments and royalties upon commercialization. $120 million to technologies attributed to technology platforms that produce high affinity, fully human antibodies for use in a broad range of therapeutic areas, including immunology and oncology. Developed technology will be amortized over the expected useful lives 10 years. $315 million to licenses attributed to three separate license arrangements that have received regulatory approval. Licenses will be amortized over the expected useful lives of 13 years. The projected cash flows assumed initial positive cash flows to commence shortly after the receipt of expected regulatory approvals, subject to trial results among other things, which, if approved, could potentially be as early as 2011 or 2012. The projected cash flows were discounted at 12%. Actual cash flows attributed to the project are likely to be different than assumed. Impairment Goodwill Goodwill is tested at least annually for impairment using a two-step process. The first step is to identify a potential impairment, and the second step measures the amount of the impairment loss, if any. Goodwill is considered impaired if the carrying amount of a reporting unit goodwill exceeds its estimated fair value. The BioPharmaceutical segment includes several separate reporting units based on geography which were aggregated for impairment testing purposes. Based upon our most recent annual impairment test completed during the first quarter of 2010, the fair value of goodwill is substantially in excess of the related carrying value. For discussion on goodwill, acquired in-process research and development and other intangible assets, see Item 8. Financial Statements Note 1. Accounting Policies Goodwill, Acquired In-Process Research and Development and Other Intangible Assets. Indefinite-Lived Intangible Assets, including IPRD Indefinite-lived intangible assets not subject to amortization are tested for impairment annually, or more frequently, if events or changes in circumstances indicate that the asset might be impaired. We consider various factors including the stage of development, 69 Table of Contents current legal and regulatory environment and the competitive landscape. Considering the industry success rate of bringing developmental compounds to market, IPRD impairment charges may occur in future periods. In 2010, we recognized a $10 million charge related to a Medarex project that we ceased development on. Long-Lived Assets We periodically evaluate whether current facts or circumstances indicate that the carrying value of our depreciable assets to be held and used may not be recoverable. If such circumstances are determined to exist, an estimate of undiscounted future cash flows produced by the long-lived asset, or the appropriate grouping of assets, is compared to the carrying value to determine whether impairment exists. If an asset is determined to be impaired, the loss is measured based on the difference between the asset fair value and its carrying value. An estimate of the asset fair value is based on quoted market prices in active markets, if available. If quoted market prices are not available, the estimate of fair value is based on various valuation techniques, including a discounted value of estimated future cash flows. We report an asset to be disposed of at the lower of its carrying value or its estimated net realizable value. The estimates of future cash flows are based on reasonable and supportable assumptions and projections requiring judgment. Changes in key assumptions about our businesses and their prospects, or changes in market conditions, could result in impairment charges. Impairment charges of long-lived assets were $228 million in 2010, $3 million in 2009 and $63 million in 2008. For discussion on impairment of long-lived assets, see Item 8. Financial Statements Note 1. Accounting Policies Impairment of Long-Lived Assets. During 2010, a $200 million asset impairment charge was recognized in connection with the write-down of assets to fair value less cost to sell when the manufacturing operations in Latina, Italy met the held for sale criteria. An additional $18 million charge was recognized when the operations were sold. See Item 8. Financial Statements Note 4. Restructuring for additional information. A manufacturing operation was also evaluated for impairment as a result of lower sales forecasts. The facility is being depreciated over its expected useful life and has a net carrying value of approximately $300 million at December 31, 2010. The anticipated undiscounted cash flows attributed to the facility exceeds the net carrying value by a significant amount and as a result, no impairment was recognized during 2010. The expected cash flows were estimated based on current sales forecasts. These expectations are subject to change based upon the near and long term production volumes and margins generated by this facility as well as any potential alternative future use which may lead to a future impairment. Marketable Securities and Investments in Other Companies Our marketable securities are classified as available for sale and therefore reported at fair value with changes in fair value reported as accumulated other comprehensive income. Declines in fair value considered other than temporary are charged to earnings. Fair value is determined based on observable market quotes or valuation models using assessments of counterparty credit worthiness, credit default risk or underlying security and overall capital market liquidity. When determining if a security is other-than-temporarily impaired we typically consider the severity and duration of the decline, future prospects of the issuer and our ability and intent to hold the security to recovery. Declines in fair value determined to be credit related are charged to earnings. Transfers between fair value levels are recognized at the beginning of the reporting period. An average cost method is used in determining realized gains and losses on the sale of available for sale securities. Realized gains and losses are included in other (income)/expense. For level 3 investments, including FRS and ARS, we utilize valuation models including those that are based on expected cash flow streams and collateral values, including assessments of counterparty credit quality, default risk underlying the security, discount rates and overall capital market liquidity. The valuation is subject to uncertainties that are difficult to predict and utilize a considerable amount of judgment and estimation. Factors that may impact our valuation include changes to credit ratings of the securities as well as to the underlying assets supporting those securities, rates of default of the underlying assets, underlying collateral value, discount rates, counterparty risk and ongoing strength and quality of market credit and liquidity. For discussions on current and non-current marketable securities, FRS and ARS, see Item 8. Financial Statements Note 11. Fair Value Measurement and Note 12. Cash, Cash Equivalents and Marketable Securities. We account for 50% or less owned companies over which we have the ability to exercise significant influence using the equity method of accounting. Our share of net income or losses of equity investments is included in equity in net income of affiliates in the consolidated statements of earnings. For investments whose fair market value falls below its carrying value we assess if the decline is other than temporary and consider our intent and ability to hold investments, the market price and market price fluctuations of the investment publicly traded shares and inability of the investee to sustain an earnings capacity. Impairment losses are recognized in other (income)/expense when a decline in market value is deemed to be other than temporary. 70 Table of Contents Contingencies In the normal course of business, we are subject to contingencies, such as legal proceedings and claims arising out of our business, that cover a wide range of matters, including, among others, government investigations, shareholder lawsuits, product and environmental liability, and tax matters. We recognize accruals for such contingencies when it is probable that a liability will be incurred and the amount of the loss can be reasonably estimated. These estimates are subject to uncertainties that are difficult to predict and, as such, actual results could vary from these estimates. For discussions on contingencies, see Item 8. Financial Statements Note 1. Accounting Policies Contingencies, Note 10. Income Taxes and Note 26. Legal Proceedings and Contingencies. Income Taxes Valuation allowances are recognized to reduce deferred tax assets when it is more likely than not that a tax benefit will not be realized. The assessment of whether or not a valuation allowance is required often requires significant judgment including the long-range forecast of future taxable income and the evaluation of tax planning initiatives. These judgments are subject to change. Adjustments to the deferred tax valuation allowances are made to earnings in the period when such assessments are made. Our net deferred tax assets were $1.8 billion and $2.2 billion at December 31, 2010 and 2009, respectively, net of valuation allowances of $1.9 billion and $1.8 billion at December 31, 2010 and 2009, respectively. We recognized deferred tax assets at December 31, 2010 related to a U.S. Federal net operating loss carryforward of $351 million and a U.S. Federal research and development tax credit carryforward of $243 million. The net operating loss carryforward expires in varying amounts beginning in 2022. The research and development tax credit carryforwards expire in varying amounts beginning in 2018. The realization of these carryforwards is dependent on generating sufficient domestic-sourced taxable income prior to their expiration. Although realization is not assured, we believe it is more likely than not that these deferred tax assets will be realized. We do not provide for taxes on undistributed earnings of foreign subsidiaries that are expected to be reinvested permanently offshore. During 2010, the Company completed an internal restructuring of certain legal entities which contributed to a $207 million tax charge recognized in the fourth quarter of 2010. It is possible that U.S. tax authorities could assert additional material tax liabilities arising from the restructuring. If such assertion were to occur, the Company would vigorously challenge any such assertion and believes it would prevail; however there can be no assurance of such a result. Prior to the Mead Johnson split-off the following transactions occurred: (i) an internal spin-off of Mead Johnson shares while still owned by us; (ii) conversion of Mead Johnson Class B shares to Class A shares; and; (iii) conversion of Mead Johnson & Company to a limited liability company. These transactions as well as the split-off of Mead Johnson through the exchange offer should qualify as tax-exempt transactions under the Internal Revenue Code based upon a private letter ruling received from the Internal Revenue Service related to the conversion of Mead Johnson Class B shares to Class A shares, and outside legal opinions. We have relied upon certain assumptions, representations and covenants by Mead Johnson regarding the future conduct of its business and other matters which could effect the tax treatment of the exchange. For example, the current tax law generally creates a presumption that the exchange would be taxable to us, if Mead Johnson or its shareholders were to engage in transactions that result in a 50% or greater change in its stock ownership during a four year period beginning two years before the exchange offer, unless it is established that the exchange offer were not part of a plan or series of related transactions to effect such a change in ownership. If the internal spin-off or exchange offer were determined not to qualify as a tax exempt transaction, we could be subject to tax as if the exchange was a taxable sale by us at market value. In addition, we had a negative basis or excess loss account (ELA) in our investment in stock of Mead Johnson prior to these transactions. We received an opinion from outside legal counsel to the effect that it is more likely than not that we eliminated the ELA as part of these transactions and do not have taxable income with respect to the ELA. The tax law in this area is complex and it is possible that even if the internal spin-off and the exchange offer is tax exempt under the Internal Revenue Code, the IRS could assert that we have additional taxable income for the period with respect to the ELA. We could be exposed to additional taxes if this were to occur. Based upon our understanding of the Internal Revenue Code and opinion from outside legal counsel, a tax reserve of $244 million was established reducing the gain on disposal of Mead Johnson included in discontinued operations. We agreed to certain tax related indemnities with Mead Johnson as set forth in the tax sharing agreement. For example, Mead Johnson has agreed to indemnify us for potential tax effects resulting from the breach of certain representations discussed above as well as certain transactions related to the acquisition of Mead Johnson stock or assets. We have agreed to indemnify Mead Johnson for certain taxes related to its business prior to the completion of the IPO and created as part of the restructuring to facilitate the IPO. 71 Table of Contents We established liabilities for possible assessments by tax authorities resulting from known tax exposures including, but not limited to, transfer pricing matters, tax credits and deductibility of certain expenses. Such liabilities represent a reasonable provision for taxes ultimately expected to be paid and may need to be adjusted over time as more information becomes known.

Special Note Regarding Forward-Looking Statements This annual report on Form 10-K (including documents incorporated by reference) and other written and oral statements we make from time to time contain certain forward-looking statements within the meaning of Section 27A of the Securities Act of 1933 and Section 21E of the Securities Exchange Act of 1934. You can identify these forward-looking statements by the fact they use words such as should , expect , anticipate , estimate , target , may , project , guidance , intend , plan , believe and other words and terms of similar meaning and expression in connection with any discussion of future operating or financial performance. One can also identify forward-looking statements by the fact that they do not relate strictly to historical or current facts. Such forward-looking statements are based on current expectations and involve inherent risks and uncertainties, including factors that could delay, divert or change any of them, and could cause actual outcomes to differ materially from current expectations. These statements are likely to relate to, among other things, our goals, plans and projections regarding our financial position, results of operations, cash flows, market position, product development, product approvals, sales efforts, expenses, performance or results of current and anticipated products and the outcome of contingencies such as legal proceedings and financial results, which are based on current expectations that involve inherent risks and uncertainties, including internal or external factors that could delay, divert or change any of them in the next several years. We have included important factors in the cautionary statements included in this Annual Report on Form 10-K, particularly under Item 1A. Risk Factors, that we believe could cause actual results to differ materially from any forward-looking statement. Although we believe we have been prudent in our plans and assumptions, no assurance can be given that any goal or plan set forth in forward-looking statements can be achieved and readers are cautioned not to place undue reliance on such statements, which speak only as of the date made. We undertake no obligation to release publicly any revisions to forward-looking statements as a result of new information, future events or otherwise. 72 Table of Contents
