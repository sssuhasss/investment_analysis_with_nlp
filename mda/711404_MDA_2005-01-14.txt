Item 7. Management Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations. Note numbers refer to the Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements beginning on page 40 of this Form 10-K. RESULTS OF OPERATIONS In this section, we discuss the results of our operations for fiscal 2004 as compared to fiscal 2003 and the results of our operations for fiscal 2003 as compared to fiscal 2002. Certain prior period amounts have been reclassified to conform to the current period presentation. We discuss our cash flows and current financial condition under Capital Resources and Liquidity. Highlights: Fiscal Year 2004 vs. Fiscal Year 2003 Net sales up 19% to $490.2 million. Gross profit up 19%; gross margin, 64% of net sales. Operating income up 23% to $116.8 million. Operating margin at 24% of net sales up by 1 percentage point. Effective tax rate (provision for income taxes divided by income before income taxes) down to 17.5% from 24%. Diluted earnings per share up 24% to $2.59 from $2.09. Selected Statistical Information Percentage of Net Sales and Growth Years Ended October 31, 2004 % Growth 2003 % Growth 2002 Net sales 100 % 19 % 100 % 31 % 100 % Cost of sales 36 % 19 % 36 % 27 % 37 % Gross profit 64 % 19 % 64 % 33 % 63 % Selling, general and administrative 39 % 17 % 40 % 29 % 40 % Research and development 1 % 17 % 1 % 29 % 1 % Amortization 34 % 4 % 1 % Operating income 24 % 23 % 23 % 42 % 21 % Net Sales Cooper two business units, CooperVision (CVI) and CooperSurgical (CSI) generate all its sales: CVI markets, develops and manufactures a broad range of soft contact lenses for the worldwide vision care market. CSI markets medical devices, diagnostic products and surgical instruments and accessories used primarily by gynecologists and obstetricians. Our consolidated net sales grew by 19% in 2004 and 31% in 2003. Both CVI and CSI have consistently achieved double-digit net sales growth over the three-year period driven by organic growth as well as acquisitions. 19 Table of Contents Management Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations (Continued) Growth ($ in millions) 2004 vs. 2003 2003 vs. 2002 Business unit CVI $ 59.1 18 % $ 85.7 35 % CSI $ 19.3 23 % $ 10.8 15 % 2004 Compared with 2003 CVI Net Sales Practitioner and patient preferences in the worldwide contact lens market continue to change. The major shifts are from: Conventional lenses replaced annually to disposable and frequently replaced lenses. Disposable lenses are designed for either daily, two-week or monthly replacement; frequently replaced lenses are designed for replacement after one to three months. Commodity lenses to specialty lenses including toric lenses, cosmetic lenses, multifocal lenses and lenses for patients experiencing the symptoms of dry eye syndrome. Commodity spherical lenses to value-added spherical lenses such as lenses with aspherical optical properties. These shifts favor CVI line of specialty products, which comprise over 62% of CVI worldwide business and 70% of its revenue in the United States. Definitions: Lens revenue consists of sales of spherical lenses, which include aspherically designed lenses and specialty lenses toric, cosmetic, multifocal lenses and lenses for patients with dry eyes. Aspheric lenses correct only for near- and farsightedness, but they have additional optical properties that help improve visual acuity in low light conditions and can correct low levels of astigmatism and low levels of presbyopia, an age-related vision defect. Toric lens designs correct astigmatism by adding the additional optical properties of cylinder and axis, which correct for irregularities in the shape of the cornea. Cosmetic lenses are opaque and color enhancing lenses that alter the natural appearance of the eye. Multifocal lenses are designed to correct presbyopia. Proclear lenses help enhance tissue/device compatibility for patients experiencing mild discomfort relating to dry eyes during lens wear. The primary reasons for CVI 2004 revenue growth include continued global market share gains during the year with disposable toric revenue up 45%, total toric product revenue up 22% and disposable sphere revenue up 20%. CVI line of specialty lenses grew 23% during the year. Sales growth is driven primarily through increases in the volume of lenses sold as the market continues to move to more frequent replacement including within rapidly growing specialty lenses. Sales increases also resulted from the global rollout of Proclear toric and multifocal lenses which, respectively, increased 96% and 94% to $15.7 million and $11.4 million in the twelve-month period. While unit 20 Table of Contents Management Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations (Continued) growth and product mix have influenced revenue growth, average realized prices by product have not materially influenced revenue growth. Since the acquisition of Biocompatibles in fiscal 2002, CVI has actively marketed Proclear lenses. In many cases, practitioners now recommend Proclear lenses rather than older CVI products. CVI Net Sales ($ in millions) 2004 2003 Growth Reported: U.S. $ 184.7 48 % $ 164.8 50 % 12 % International 204.0 52 % 164.8 50 % 24 % Total reported $ 388.7 100 % $ 329.6 100 % 18 % International sales grew 24% (12% in constant currency) to $204 million in the year, led by sales of two-week and monthly sphere products, which grew $23.3 million, or 27%. Also, sales of two-week and monthly toric products grew 62%, or $20.9 million. International sales growth was partially offset by declines in conventional spheres and torics of 17% and 16%, respectively. Sales in the United States grew 12% in fiscal 2004, primarily due to sales of two-week and monthly toric products, which grew 32% to $56.3 million. Also, sales of the Biocompatibles product lines, especially the sales of Proclear specialty lenses, enhanced the revenue growth. CVI New Products and Markets During 2004, CVI expanded its product offerings: Two-week disposable toric lens to correct astigmatism introduced in Japan. Proclear disposable multifocal, a disposable product for wearers with both presbyopia, the blurring of vision that occurs with aging, and the symptoms of dry eye syndrome, introduced in European markets. Outlook We believe that CVI will continue to compete successfully in the worldwide contact lens market with its disposable and frequently replaced lenses (DPR), toric lenses, aspheric lenses and newer specialty lenses including Proclear products for lens wearers who experience mild dry eye discomfort, cosmetic lenses (both those that change and those that accentuate the eye natural color) and multifocal lenses. In the U.S., market demographics are favorable, as the teenaged population, the age when most contact lens wear begins, is projected to grow considerably over the next two decades. The reported incidence of myopia continues to increase worldwide. We expect greater market penetration in Europe and the Far East as practitioners increasingly prescribe more specialty lenses. The acquisition of Ocular Sciences, Inc. (Ocular) brings a number of benefits to the Company. The CVI and Ocular product lines are highly complementary. Ocular disposable spherical lenses, daily wear lenses and silicone hydrogel extended wear technology augment CVI line of specialty 21 Table of Contents Management Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations (Continued) lenses, making the combined entity fully competitive in all major contact lens product categories in all major markets around the world. In North America, the world largest contact lens market, Ocular strength in large retail optometric chain customers complements CVI strength on independent professional optometric customers. Ocular strong presence in Japan and the Asia Pacific region provides CVI with more rapid access to significant market share in the world second largest contact lens market where CVI currently has a low market share. Ocular European operations, especially their strong position in Germany, complement CVI strong British, French, Italian and Spanish businesses. Ocular Gen II manufacturing process supports CVI CooperSync programs targeted at lower cost lens manufacturing resulting, over time, in reduced production costs and improved gross margins. We anticipate that CVI will continue its revenue growth at rates faster than the anticipated constant currency market increase of 8% - 10%. CSI Net Sales Women healthcare products used primarily in obstetricians and gynecologists practices generate about 90% of CSI revenue. The balance are sales of medical devices outside of women healthcare where CSI does not actively market. In 2004, CSI sales increased 23% to $101.5 million, $19.3 million above 2003, primarily due to recent acquisitions. Organic growth of existing products was about 4%. While unit growth and product mix have influenced organic revenue growth, average realized prices by product have not materially influenced such growth. Results of operations of acquired companies are included in our consolidated results beginning on the acquisition date. We discuss acquisitions completed in fiscal 2004 below. Acquisitions completed in fiscal 2003 are discussed under 2003 Compared with 2002 in the CSI Net Sales section. 2004 CSI Acquisitions (See Note 2) In December 2003, CSI announced the purchase from privately-held SURx, Inc., of the assets and associated worldwide license rights for the Laparoscopic (LP) and Transvaginal (TV) product lines of its Radio Frequency (RF) Bladder Neck Suspension technology, which uses radio frequency based thermal energy instead of implants to restore continence. In February 2004, Cooper acquired Milex Products, Inc., a manufacturer and marketer of obstetric and gynecologic products and customized print services. Milex is a leading supplier of pessaries products used to medically manage female urinary incontinence and pelvic support conditions and also supplies cancer screening products, including endometrial and endocervical sampling devices and a breast biopsy needle for fine needle aspiration. Milex also publishes patient education materials that discuss prenatal and pregnancy issues, breast health, menopause and osteoporosis. 22 Table of Contents Management Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations (Continued) Demographics Favorable demographic trends also support CSI business. The women of the baby-boomer generation are now reaching the age when gynecological procedures are performed most frequently, and CSI has, through both acquisition and internal development, built an extensive product line to diagnose and treat these patients. Outlook We anticipate that CSI will continue to consolidate the women healthcare market. Fiscal 2005 revenue is expected to range from $115 million to $118 million. During 2004, following the acquisition of Milex, CSI implemented an initiative to expand its sales and marketing efforts in order to increase organic growth over the next several years. These programs will focus on CSI products in the incontinence, infertility and female sterilization markets using its restructured sales force of independent and direct sales representatives. 2003 Compared with 2002 CVI Net Sales CVI worldwide sales grew 35% in fiscal 2003. CVI reported net sales include Biocompatibles revenue beginning in March 2002. In the following table, we adjust CVI reported sales by adding Biocompatibles sales for the four-month period in fiscal 2002 that we did not own them (as shown on the Biocompatibles unaudited ledgers) to the year actual results. The total represents the lens business we now own. Since the acquisition of Biocompatibles, CVI has actively marketed Proclear lenses. In many cases, practitioners now recommend Proclear lenses rather than older CVI products. 23 Table of Contents Management Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations (Continued) CVI Net Sales ($ in millions) 2003 2002 Growth Reported: U.S. $ 164.8 $ 131.3 26 % International 164.8 112.6 46 % Total reported $ 329.6 $ 243.9 35 % Adjustments To include Biocompatibles sales for comparable periods: Four months ended February 28, 2002 U.S. $ 6.3 International 18.8 Soft lens revenue $ 25.1 As adjusted: U.S. $ 164.8 $ 137.6 20 % International 164.8 131.4 25 % Total as adjusted $ 329.6 $ 269.0 23 % Total adjusted worldwide sales grew 23% (16% in constant currency) in 2003. International sales grew 25% (12% in constant currency) to $164.8 million in the year, led by sales of two-week and monthly sphere products, which grew $24.7 million, or 40%. Also, sales of two-week and monthly toric products grew 42% or $10 million. Adjusted sales in the United States grew 20% in fiscal 2003, primarily due to sales of two-week and monthly sphere products, which grew 33% to $14.4 million. Also, sales of two-week and monthly toric products grew 47% to $14 million. The acquisition of Biocompatibles product lines, especially the sales of Proclear and other specialty lenses, enhanced the revenue growth. The primary reasons for the 2003 revenue growth were: 21% increase in toric lens sales. Continued momentum in Europe with sales up 20% Growth in disposable spheres up 37%. CSI Net Sales Women healthcare products used primarily by obstetricians and gynecologists generate about 90% of CSI sales. The balance are sales of medical devices outside of women healthcare where CSI does not actively market. In 2003, CSI sales increased 15% to $82.2 million, $10.8 million above 2002, primarily due to acquisitions. The reported growth was slowed by declining sales in more mature product lines, softness in the equipment portion of the market and a delay in replacing an in-vitro fertilization catheter that CSI could no longer market when an exclusive distributor relationship ended. 24 Table of Contents Management Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations (Continued) 2003 CSI Acquisitions (See Note 2) In May, acquired Prism Enterprises, LP, which develops, manufacturers and markets medical devices and disposable products for the obstetric, neonatal and gynecological market. In October, acquired Avalon Medical Corporation the United States distributor of the Filshie Clip, a device used worldwide to perform female sterilization. 2004 Compared to 2003 and 2003 Compared to 2002 Cost of Sales/Gross Profit Gross Profit Percentage of Net Sales 2004 2003 2002 CVI 67 % 67 % 67 % CSI 55 % 54 % 51 % Consolidated 64 % 64 % 63 % CVI gross margin for fiscal 2004, at 67%, was equal to 2003 and 2002. CVI manufactures about 66% of its lenses in the United Kingdom. The favorable impact of currency on revenue is offset by the unfavorable impact on manufacturing costs. In addition, we have lower gross margin on sales to Asia-Pacific distributors, which increased 27%. CSI gross margin improved to 55% from 54% in 2003 as we completed the integration of acquisitions including Prism and Avalon. CSI 2003 gross margin was 54% of net sales, up from 51% in 2002. CSI 2002 margin was 54% prior to the impact of a charge against cost of sales of about $2 million for the phase out of the Cerveillance colposcopy system. For fiscal 2005, absent the impact of future acquisitions, we expect that CSI gross margins from recurring activities will improve as we complete integration of recent acquisitions and progress with the initiative to expand sales and marketing efforts targeted at organic growth. Selling, General and Administrative Expense (SGA) (In millions) 2004 2003 2002 CVI $ 147.9 $ 127.4 $ 98.9 CSI 31.9 23.7 20.3 Headquarters 10.7 11.8 7.5 $ 190.5 $ 162.9 $ 126.7 Consolidated SGA increased by 17% in 2004 and 29% in 2003, which support the increase in sales. As a percentage of net sales, consolidated SGA was 39% in fiscal 2004 and 40% in 2003 and 2002. CVI SGA increased 16% in 2004 and 29% in 2003. SGA as a percentage of net sales improved to 38% in 2004 from 39% in 2003 on reductions of advertising and distribution costs. However, selling, promotion and distribution costs to introduce new products continued in 2004. 25 Table of Contents Management Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations (Continued) CSI 2004 SGA increased 35% over 2003, which support the 23% increase in sales. Selling and marketing costs increased to support CSI initiative to increase organic growth. In 2003, SGA increased 16% over 2002. Corporate headquarters SGA decreased to 2.2% of consolidated net sales from 2.9% in 2003 and 2.4% in 2002. Headquarters 2004 expenses decreased 9% to $10.7 million as expenses to maintain our global trading arrangement declined. Headquarters 2003 expenses increased 58% over 2002 due to various projects associated with our global trading arrangement. Research and Development Expense Research and development expense was 1% of net sales in fiscal 2004, 2003 and 2002: $6.5 million in 2004, $5.6 million in 2003 and $4.3 million in 2002. CVI continues to invest in two research programs: the development of an extended wear contact lens and an improved contact lens technology. Most of our R&D expense, other than the two programs, is for clinical, regulatory and other product development activities and not for basic research. Amortization of Intangibles Amortization of intangibles was $2.1 million in 2004 and $1.5 million in 2003 and 2002. Amortization expense increased in fiscal 2004 primarily due to acquired intangible assets. Operating Income Operating income grew $49.8 million or 74% between 2002 and 2004: Years Ended October 31, ($ in millions) 2004 2003 2002 CVI $ 106.6 $ 88.8 $ 60.4 CSI 20.9 18.2 14.1 Headquarters (10.7 ) (11.8 ) (7.5 ) $ 116.8 $ 95.2 $ 67.0 Percent growth 23 % 42 % 22 % Other Income, Net Years Ended October 31, (In thousands) 2004 2003 2002 Interest income $ 351 $ 246 $ 179 Gain on sale of Quidel stock 1,443 621 1,168 Gain on Litmus/Quidel transaction 2,075 Foreign exchange gain 69 1,815 1,774 Settlement of dispute (377 ) (500 ) Other 256 27 (124 ) $ 1,742 $ 2,209 $ 5,072 26 Table of Contents Management Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations (Continued) Gain on Sale of Quidel Stock In fiscal 2004, 2003 and 2002, we sold 339,725, 250,000 and 592,000 shares of Quidel stock, and realized gains of approximately $1.4 million, $621,000 and $1.2 million, respectively (see Note 7). Gain on Litmus/Quidel Transaction In the first quarter of 2001, Quidel Corporation (Quidel) acquired Litmus Concepts, Inc. (Litmus) through an exchange of common stock. Cooper held a preferred equity position in Litmus, which equated to approximately a 10 percent ownership. As a result of this transaction, we received 1,138,725 shares of Quidel common stock. In the third quarter of 2002, we received an additional 334,727 shares of Quidel that were held in escrow and recorded a gain of $2.1 million, based on the fair market value of Quidel shares on the day we received them. Foreign Exchange In 2004, the pound strengthened against the dollar, resulting in a net gain of about $69,000. We have taken steps to minimize this exposure. Our policy continues to be to hedge foreign exchange exposure whenever possible. In 2003, the pound strengthened against the dollar, resulting in a net gain of about $1.8 million. When we acquired Biocompatibles, we inherited intercompany accounts in various currencies, primarily pounds sterling. In 2002, the acquisition of Biocompatibles and additional capitalization for international operations provided about $21 million in pounds sterling to a U.K. affiliate for short-term financing. While the loans were outstanding, the pound strengthened against the dollar, and a net gain of about $1.5 million resulted when the loan was repaid. Additional gains of $300,000 resulted from currency exposures that were acquired and not hedged. Settlement of Dispute In 2004, we paid $377,000 to settle a legal dispute, and in 2003 we paid a one-time fee of $500,000 to settle a legal dispute. Interest Expense Interest expense was $6 million in 2004, $7 million in 2003 and $6.9 million in 2002. Interest expense decreased in 2004, reflecting a general decrease in interest rates and reduced debt levels due to strong operating cash flow. Provision for Income Taxes Our effective tax rate (ETR) for fiscal 2004 was 17.5% down from fiscal 2003 effective tax rate (ETR) of 24% and fiscal 2002 ETR of 25%. The reduction of our ETR resulted from a greater percent of our income being taxed at rates substantially lower than the U.S. statutory rate. We expect our ETR to be 21% for fiscal 2005. 27 Table of Contents Management Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations (Continued) With anticipated faster growth outside the U.S. and a favorable mix of products manufactured outside the U.S., Cooper now expects that its net operating loss carryforwards (NOLs) in the U.S. will last through 2007. We implemented a global trading arrangement in fiscal 1999 to minimize both the taxes reported in our statement of income and the actual taxes we will have to pay when we use all the benefits of our NOLs. The global trading arrangement consisted of a restructuring of legal ownership for the CooperVision foreign sales and manufacturing subsidiaries. The stock of those subsidiaries is now owned by a single foreign holding company, which centrally directs much of the activities of those subsidiaries. The foreign holding company has applied for and received the benefits of a reduced tax rate under a special tax regime available in its country of domicile. Assuming no other major acquisitions or large stock issuance, we currently expect that this plan will extend the cash flow benefits of the existing NOLs through 2007, and that actual cash payments of taxes will average less than 5% of pretax profits over this period. After 2007, actual cash payments of taxes are expected to average less than 20% of pretax profits. CAPITAL RESOURCES AND LIQUIDITY Year 2004 Highlights Operating cash flow up 27% to $101.2 million vs. $79.6 million in 2003. Completed four acquisitions and paid other acquisition costs totaling $63.9 million. Expenditures for purchases of property, plant and equipment $40.5 million vs. $33.9 million in 2003. Comparative Statistics Years Ended October 31, ($ in millions) 2004 2003 Cash and cash equivalents $ 39.4 $ 47.4 Total assets $ 811.6 $ 705.6 Working capital $ 188.0 $ 148.8 Total debt $ 165.7 $ 185.9 Stockholders equity $ 544.2 $ 422.0 Ratio of debt to equity 0.30:1 0.44:1 Debt as a percentage of total capitalization 23 % 31 % Operating Cash Flows Cash flow provided from operating activities continues as Cooper major source of liquidity, totaling $101.2 million in fiscal 2004 and $79.6 million in 2003. Major uses of cash for operating activities included payments of $3.5 million for income taxes, $5.4 million in interest payments, $3 million final payment on a previously accrued dispute settlement 28 Table of Contents Management Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations (Continued) with Medical Engineering Corporation, a subsidiary of Bristol-Myers Squibb Company, pursuant to a 1993 settlement agreement and $3.1 million to fund 2003 entitlements under Cooper bonus plans. Working capital increased $39.2 million in fiscal 2004, as cash decreased $8 million, primarily to fund acquisitions, marketable securities decreased $3.9 million from sales of securities and the decline of the market value of securities available for sale, current accrued liabilities and accounts payable increased $900,000, and short-term debt increased $200,000, partially offset by increases of $17.9 million in inventory, $14.6 million in receivables and $19.7 million in current deferred tax assets and other. The increase in inventory is due to the growth in the overall business, planned inventory increases to improve service levels, acquisitions and the effect of foreign exchange. The increase in receivables is primarily due to the increase in sales. At the end of fiscal 2004, Cooper inventory months on hand was 6.9 versus 7.0 at fiscal year end 2003. Cooper continued to improve its receivable collections with days of sales outstanding (DSO s) at the end of the current year declining to 65 days from 67 days at October 31, 2003. Looking forward, we expect DSO in the mid to upper 60 to low 70 given continued strong growth expectations outside the United States where DSO are higher. Based on our experience and knowledge of our customers and our analysis of inventoried products and product levels, we believe that our accounts receivable and inventories are recoverable. Investing Cash Flows The cash outflow of $100.6 million for investing activities was driven by payments of $63.9 million on acquisitions and capital expenditures of $40.5 million used primarily to expand manufacturing capacity and the continued rollout of new information systems. The cash outflow was partially offset by $3.8 million of cash received from the sale of marketable securities. Financing Cash Flows The cash outflow of $8.7 million from financing activities was driven by net repayment of debt of about $20.5 million and dividends paid on our common stock of $1.9 million offset by $13.7 million from the exercise of stock options. OFF BALANCE SHEET ARRANGEMENTS None. 29 Table of Contents Management Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations (Continued) CONTRACTUAL OBLIGATIONS AND COMMERCIAL COMMITMENTS As of October 31, 2004, we had the following contractual obligations and commercial commitments: Payments Due by Period (In millions) 2005 2006 & 2007 2008 & 2009 2010 & Beyond Contractual obligations: Long-term debt $ 19.1 $ 32.0 $ 0.2 $ 112.4 Capital leases 1.2 0.2 Operating leases 7.2 11.3 8.2 17.6 Total contractual obligations 27.5 43.5 8.4 130.0 Commercial commitments: Stand-by letters of credit 3.9 Total $ 31.4 $ 43.5 $ 8.4 $ 130.0 The expected future benefit payments for pension plans for years one through ten are disclosed in Note 10, Employee Benefits. Risk Management (See Note 1) Most of our operations outside of the United States have their reporting currency as their functional currency. We are exposed to risks caused by changes in foreign exchange principally on balances denominated in other than the locations functional currency. We have taken steps to minimize our balance sheet exposure. We are also exposed to risks associated with changes in interest rates, as the interest rate on each of our revolving credit agreement and term loan debt varies with the London Interbank Offered Rate. We have decreased this risk by issuing fixed rate debt in the form of 2.625% convertible debentures. Outlook We believe that cash and cash equivalents on hand of $39.4 million plus cash from operating activities will fund future operations, capital expenditures, cash dividends and smaller acquisitions. At October 31, 2004, we had $143.1 million available under the KeyBank line of credit. See Note 13, Subsequent Events in the Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements for the effect of the January 6, 2005, acquisition of Ocular Sciences, Inc. Inflation and Changing Prices Inflation had no appreciable effect on our operations in the last three years. New Accounting Pronouncements In October 2004, the Financial Accounting Standards Board (FASB) ratified the consensus of the Emerging Issues Task Force (EITF) with respect to Issue No. 04-8, The Effect of Contingently Convertible Debt on Diluted Earnings Per Share. The EITF consensus states that shares of common stock contingently issuable pursuant to contingent convertible securities should be included in 30 Table of Contents Management Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations (Continued) computations of diluted earnings per share (if dilutive) regardless of whether their market price triggers (or other contingent features) have been met. Additionally, in its efforts to converge with international accounting standards, the FASB has issued an Exposure Draft, Earnings Per Share an amendment of FASB Statement No. 128. This Exposure Draft states that contingent convertible securities which contain an option to settle in cash or stock be assumed to settle in stock for purposes of computing diluted earnings per share. Cooper currently has $115 million of outstanding contingently convertible senior debentures (Debentures) due on July 1, 2023. The Debentures are convertible into 22.5201 shares of our common stock per $1,000 principal amount of Debentures or approximately 2.6 million shares. In our fiscal fourth quarter 2004, the debentures became convertible as our share price exceeded 120% of the conversion price for 20 consecutive trading days in the 30 consecutive trading day period ending on the last trading day of the quarter ended July 31, 2004. However, prior to July 1, 2008, we may not redeem at our option nor may a holder require us to repurchase any outstanding debentures. During the fourth fiscal quarter 2004, the Company elected to adopt the provisions of EITF Issue No. 04-8 and as a result included the dilutive effect of the debentures in its diluted earnings per share calculation from the time of issuance of the debentures our fiscal third quarter 2003, in accordance with the if-converted methodology under FASB Statement No. 128. Accordingly, prior period diluted EPS has been restated (see Note 4). In December 2004, FASB issued FASB Statement No. 123 (revised 2004), Share-Based Payment (Statement 123(R)). It requires that the compensation cost relating to share-based payment transactions be recognized in the financial statements and that cost will be measured based on the fair value of the equity or liability instruments issued. Statement 123(R) replaces FASB Statement No. 123, Accounting for Stock-Based Compensation, and supersedes APB Opinion No. 25, Accounting for Stock Issued to Employees, in effect removing the option, stated in FASB No. 123, to apply the guidance in Opinion 25. This statement is effective as the beginning of the first reporting period that begins after June 15, 2005, or our fourth fiscal quarter 2005. Transition may be accomplished using the modified prospective application or the modified retrospective application. Cooper currently measures compensation costs related to share-based payments under Opinion 25, as allowed by FASB No. 123. This will affect both our net income and earning per share as determined by the transition methodology in Statement 123(R). Estimates and Critical Accounting Policies Management estimates and judgments are an integral part of financial statements prepared in accordance with accounting principles generally accepted in the United States of America (GAAP). We believe that the critical accounting policies described in this section address the more significant estimates required of Management when preparing our consolidated financial statements in accordance with GAAP. We consider an accounting estimate critical if changes in the estimate may have a material impact on our financial condition or results of operations. We believe that the accounting estimates employed are appropriate and resulting balances are reasonable; however, actual results could differ from the original estimates, requiring adjustment to these balances in future periods. 31 Table of Contents Management Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations (Continued) Revenue recognition We recognize revenue when it is realized or realizable and earned, based on terms of sale with the customer, where persuasive evidence of an agreement exists, delivery has occurred, the seller price is fixed and determinable and collectibility is reasonably assured. For contact lenses as well as CooperSurgical medical devices, diagnostic products and surgical instruments and accessories, this primarily occurs upon product shipment, when risk of ownership transfers to our customers. We believe our revenue recognition policies are appropriate in all circumstances, and that our policies are reflective of our customer arrangements. We record, based on historical statistics, estimated reductions to revenue for customer incentive programs offered including cash discounts, promotional and advertising allowances, volume discounts, contractual pricing allowances, rebates and specifically established customer product return programs. While estimates are involved, historically, most of these programs have not been major factors in our business, since a high percentage of our revenue is from direct sales to doctors. Allowance for doubtful accounts Our reported balance of accounts receivable, net of the allowance for doubtful accounts, represents our estimate of the amount that ultimately will be realized in cash. We review the adequacy of our allowance for doubtful accounts on an ongoing basis, using historical payment trends and the age of the receivables and knowledge of our individual customers. When our analyses indicate, we increase or decrease our allowance accordingly. However, if the financial condition of our customers were to deteriorate, additional allowances may be required. While estimates are involved, bad debts historically have not been a significant factor given the diversity of our customer base, well established historical payment patterns and the fact that patients require satisfaction of healthcare needs in both strong and weak economics. Net realizable value of inventory In assessing the value of inventories, we must make estimates and judgments regarding aging of inventories and other relevant issues potentially affecting the saleable condition of products and estimated prices at which those products will sell. On an ongoing basis, we review the carrying value of our inventory, measuring number of months on hand and other indications of salability, and reduce the value of inventory if there are indications that the carrying value is greater than market. While estimates are involved, historically, obsolescence has not been a significant factor due to long product dating and lengthy product life cycles. We target to keep, on average, about seven months of inventory on hand to maintain high customer service levels. Valuation of goodwill We account for goodwill and evaluate our goodwill balances and test them for impairment in accordance with the provisions of FASB Statement No. 142, Goodwill and Other Intangible Assets. We no longer amortize goodwill. We test goodwill for impairment annually during the third fiscal quarter and when an event occurs or circumstances change such that it is reasonably possible that impairment may exist. We performed an impairment test in our third fiscal quarter 2004, and our analysis indicated that we have no goodwill impairment. The FASB Statement No. 142 goodwill impairment test is a two-step process. Initially, we compare the book value of net assets to the fair value of each reporting unit that has goodwill assigned to them. If the fair value is determined to be less than the book value, a second step is performed to compute the amount of the impairment. When available and as appropriate, we use comparative market multiples to corroborate fair value results. A reporting unit is the level of reporting at which goodwill is tested for impairment. 32 Table of Contents Management Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations (Continued) Our reporting units are the same as our business segments CooperVision and CooperSurgical reflecting the way that we manage our business. Our most recent estimate of fair value, at the time of our May 1, 2004, review and using several valuation techniques including assessing industry multiples, for CooperVision ranged from $1 billion to $1.6 billion compared to a carrying value of $438 million and for CooperSurgical fair value ranged from $317 million to $461 million compared to a carrying value of $167 million. Business combinations We routinely consummate business combinations. We allocate the purchase price of acquisitions based on our estimates and judgments of the fair value of net assets purchased, acquisition costs incurred and intangibles other than goodwill. On individually significant acquisitions, we utilize independent valuation experts to provide a basis in order to refine the purchase price allocation, if appropriate. Results of operations for acquired companies are included in our consolidated results of operations from the date of acquisition. Income taxes As part of the process of preparing our consolidated financial statements, we must estimate a portion of our income tax expense for each of the jurisdictions in which we operate. This process requires significant Management judgments and involves estimating our current tax exposures in each jurisdiction including the impact, if any, of additional taxes resulting from tax examinations as well as judging the recoverability of deferred tax assets. To the extent recovery of deferred tax assets is not likely based on our estimation of future taxable income in each jurisdiction, a valuation allowance is established. The Company currently has $42.9 million of deferred tax assets that primarily represent the future benefit of U.S. net operating loss carryforwards, which expire between 2006 and 2020. To the extent these net operating losses are not used timely by future profits, a valuation allowance or write-off could result. Tax exposures can involve complex issues and may require an extended period to resolve. Frequent changes in tax laws in each jurisdiction complicate future estimates. We are required to estimate full-year income and the related income tax expense in each jurisdiction. We adjust the estimated effective tax rate for the tax related to significant unusual items. Changes in the geographic mix or estimated level of annual pre-tax income can affect the overall effective tax rate, and such changes could be material. 33 Table of Contents
