Item 7. Management Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations In Management Discussion and Analysis, we provide a historical and prospective narrative of our general financial condition, results of operations, liquidity and certain other factors that may affect our future results, including: an overview of the key drivers of the automotive aftermarket; key events and recent developments within our company; our results of operations for the years ended 2009, 2008 and 2007; our liquidity and capital resources; any off balance sheet arrangements we utilize; any contractual obligations to which we are committed; our critical accounting estimates; the inflation and seasonality of our business; our quarterly results for the fourth quarter of 2009; and new accounting standards that affect our company. The review of Management Discussion and Analysis should be made in conjunction with our consolidated financial statements, related notes and other financial information included elsewhere in this annual report.

OVERVIEW O Reilly Automotive, Inc. is a specialty retailer of automotive aftermarket parts, tools, supplies, equipment and accessories in the United States. We are one of the largest automotive aftermarket specialty retailers, selling our products to both do-it-yourself (DIY) customers and professional installers. Our stores carry an extensive product line consisting of new and remanufactured automotive hard parts, maintenance items and accessories and a complete line of auto body paint and related materials, automotive tools and professional installer service equipment. As of December 31, 2009, we operated 3,421 stores in 38 states. Operating within the retail industry, we, along with other retail companies, are influenced by a number of general macroeconomic factors including, but not limited to, fuel costs, unemployment rates, consumer preferences and spending habits and competition. The difficult conditions that affected the overall macroeconomic environment in recent years continue to impact our company and the retail sector in general. We cannot predict whether, when, or the manner in which, these economic conditions will change. We believe that the number of U.S. miles driven, number of U.S. registered vehicles, average vehicle age, new light vehicle sales, unperformed maintenance and product quality differentiation are key drivers of current and future demand of products sold within the automotive aftermarket. Number of U.S. miles driven and number of U.S. registered vehicles: Total miles driven in the U.S. heavily influences the demand for the repair and maintenance products we sell. The long-term trend in the number of vehicles on the road and the total miles driven in the U.S. has exhibited steady growth over the past decade. Between 1999 and 2007, the total number of miles driven in the United States increased at an annual rate of approximately 1.6%. According to the Department of Transportation, estimated total number of miles driven declined by 3.6% in 2008 and increased slightly in 2009. The relatively flat number of miles driven during 2009 as compared to 2008 is due to lower fuel costs compared to those in 2008, but the overall decrease in miles driven in recent years is a result of challenging macroeconomic conditions. The total number of registered vehicles on the road increased from 201 million light vehicles in 1999 to 242 million in 2008. We believe that the decrease in miles driven in 2008 and the relatively flat number of miles driven in 2009 is a short-term trend, and that long-term miles driven will increase in the future because of the increasing number of vehicles on the road. 25 Table of Contents Average vehicle age and new light vehicle sales: Changes in the average age of vehicles on the road impacts demand for automotive aftermarket products. As the average age of a vehicle increases, the vehicle goes through more routine maintenance cycles requiring replacement parts such as brakes, belts, hoses, batteries and filters. The sales of these products are a key component of our business. As reported by the Automotive Aftermarket Industry Association ( AAIA ) the average age of the United States vehicle population has increased over the past decade from 9.1 years for passenger cars and 8.5 years for light trucks in 1999 to 10.6 and 9.3 years, respectively, in 2008. Based on estimates provided by the AAIA, new car sales decreased 4.7% between 1999 and 2007 for the light vehicle market; however, sales for the same market decreased 18.5% in 2008. Due to difficult economic conditions and better engineered vehicles, we expect that consumers will continue to choose to keep their vehicles longer and drive them at higher mileages and that this increasing trend in average vehicle age will continue. Unperformed maintenance: According to estimates compiled by the AAIA, the annual amount of unperformed or underperformed maintenance in the United States totaled $50 billion for 2008. This metric represents the degree to which routine vehicle maintenance recommended by the manufacturer is not being performed. Consumer decisions to avoid or defer maintenance affect demand for our products and the total amount of unperformed maintenance represents potential future demand. We believe that challenging macroeconomic conditions in 2008 contributed to the amount of unperformed maintenance; however, with the reduced number of new car sales, we believe the amount of underperformed maintenance is decreasing as people place a higher focus on maintaining their current vehicle with the expectation of keeping the vehicle longer than they would have in a better macroeconomic environment. Product quality differentiation: We provide our customers with an assortment of products that are differentiated by quality and price for most of the product lines we offer. For many of our product offerings, this quality differentiation reflects good, better, and best alternatives. Our sales and total gross margin dollars are highest for the best quality category of products. Consumers willingness to select products at a higher point on the value spectrum is a driver of sales and profitability in our industry. We believe that the average consumer tendency has been to trade-down to lower quality products during the recent challenging economic conditions. We have ongoing initiatives targeted to marketing higher quality products to our customers and expect our customers to be more willing to return to purchasing up on the value spectrum in the future. KEY EVENTS AND RECENT DEVELOPMENTS Several key events have had or may have a significant effect on our operations and are summarized below: On July 11, 2008, we completed the acquisition of CSK Auto Corporation ( CSK ), one of the largest specialty retailers of auto parts and accessories in the Western United States and one of the largest such retailers in the United States, based on store count. Pursuant to the merger agreement, each share of CSK common stock outstanding immediately prior to the merger was canceled and converted into the right to receive 0.4285 of a share of O Reilly common stock and $1.00 in cash. The results of CSK operations have been included in our consolidated financial statements since the acquisition date. On July 11, 2008, to fund the CSK acquisition, we entered into a Credit Agreement for a $1.2 billion asset-based revolving credit facility ( ABL Credit Facility ) arranged by Bank of America, N.A. ( BA ), which we used to refinance debt, fund the cash portion of the acquisition, pay for other transaction-related expenses and provide liquidity for our combined Company going forward. On July 11, 2008, we agreed to become a guarantor, on a subordinated basis, of the $100 million principal amount of 6 3 / 4 % Exchangeable Senior Notes due 2025 (the Notes ) originally issued by CSK. The Notes are exchangeable, under certain circumstances, into cash and shares of our common stock. The Notes bear interest at 6.75% per year until December 15, 2010, and 6.5% until maturity on December 15, 2025. On each of July 24, 2008, October 14, 2008, November 24, 2008, and January 21, 2010, we entered into interest rate swap transactions with Branch Banking and Trust Company ( BBT ), BA, SunTrust Bank ( SunTrust ) and/or Barclays Capital ( Barclays ). We entered into these interest rate swap transactions to mitigate the risk associated with our floating interest rate based on LIBOR on an aggregate of $500 million of our debt that is outstanding under the Credit Agreement. The interest rate swap transaction we entered into with SunTrust on November 24, 2008, was for $50 million and matured on November 28, 2009. Since July 11, 2008, and as a result of the CSK acquisition, we have incurred and will continue to incur legal fees related to ongoing governmental investigations and indemnity obligations for the litigation that has commenced against CSK and former CSK employees. 26 Table of Contents RESULTS OF OPERATIONS The following table sets forth, certain income statement data as a percentage of sales for the years indicated: Years ended December 31, 2009 2008 2007 Sales 100 % 100 % 100 % Cost of goods sold, including warehouse and distribution expenses 52.0 54.5 55.6 Gross profit 48.0 45.5 44.4 Selling, general and administrative expenses 36.9 36.1 32.3 Operating income 11.1 9.4 12.1 Debt prepayment costs (0.2 ) Interim facility commitment fee (0.1 ) Interest expense (0.9 ) (0.7 ) (0.1 ) Interest income 0.1 0.1 Other income, net 0.1 0.1 Income before income taxes 10.3 8.5 12.2 Provision for income taxes 4.0 3.3 4.5 Net income 6.3 % 5.2 % 7.7 % 2009 Compared to 2008 Sales increased $1.27 billion, or 36%, from $3.58 billion in 2008 to $4.85 billion in 2009. The following table presents the components of the increase in sales for the year ended December 31, 2009 (in millions): Increase in Sales for the Year Ended December 31, 2009, compared to the same period in 2008 Comparable store sales $ 188.5 Stores opened throughout 2008, excluding stores open at least one year that are included in comparable stores sales 71.7 Sales of stores opened throughout 2009 72.8 Non-store sales including machinery, sales to independent part stores and team members 4.4 Sales in 2008 for stores that have merged or closed (2.1 ) Acquired CSK store sales, excluding sales that are included in comparable store sales (sales after 7/11/2009, the one year anniversary of the acquisition) 935.2 Total increase in sales $ 1,270.5 Comparable store sales are calculated based on the change in sales of stores open at least one year and exclude sales of specialty machinery, sales to independent parts stores, sales to team members and sales during the one to two week period certain CSK branded stores were closed for conversion. Comparable store sales for stores operating on the O Reilly systems increased 5.4% for the year ended December 31, 2009. The O Reilly systems comparable store sales results consisted of a 6.6% increase for the core O Reilly and post conversion Schuck stores, a 2.1% increase from the 123 converted Checker stores and a 11.9% decrease in comparable stores sales from the 141 converted Murray stores. Comparable store sales for stores operating on the legacy CSK system increased 3.0% for the year ended December 31, 2009. Consolidated comparable store sales increased 4.6% for the year ended December 31, 2009. We believe that the increased sales achieved by our stores are the result of superior inventory availability, a broader selection of products offered in most stores, a targeted promotional and advertising effort through a variety of media and localized promotional events, continued improvement in the merchandising and store layouts of the stores, compensation programs for all store team members that provide incentives for performance and our continued focus on serving professional installers. We opened 149 new O Reilly branded stores and one new Schuck store in 2009. At December 31, 2009, we operated 3,421 stores compared to 3,285 stores at December 31, 2008. Due to the acquisition and integration of CSK, we anticipate new store unit growth to be limited to 150 new stores in 2010, excluding the previously disclosed consolidation and closure of underperforming stores related to the acquisition of CSK; however, we anticipate that continued store unit growth consistent with our historical openings will continue in the future. 27 Table of Contents Gross profit increased $699 million, or 43%, from $1.63 billion (45.5% of sales) in 2008 to $2.33 billion (48.0% of sales) in 2009. The increase in gross profit dollars was primarily a result of the inclusion of a full year of sales from acquired CSK stores in 2009 versus roughly one half of a year of sales from acquired CSK stores in 2008, the increase in sales from new stores and an increase in comparable store sales from existing stores. The increase in gross profit as a percentage of sales is the result of lower product acquisition cost, changes in our product mix, distribution system improvements and a favorable pricing environment on certain commodity based products. Product acquisition costs improved primarily due to continued negotiating leverage with our vendors as a result of our significant growth related to the acquisition of CSK. We anticipate continued improvements in product acquisition costs at a moderate rate in 2010 from a full year of the benefit from improved leverage with our vendors as we anniversary product line changeovers in the acquired CSK stores throughout the year. We improved our product mix by continuing to implement strategies to differentiate our merchandise selections at each store based on customer demand and vehicle demographics in the store market and through ongoing Team Member training initiatives focused on selling products with greater gross margin contribution. Additionally, gross margin percentage improved as a result of an increased percentage of our total sales mix to DIY customers. Prior to the acquisition of CSK, our mix of sales to DIY customers was approximately equal to sales to professional installer customers. At the time of the acquisition in July of 2008, acquired CSK stores generated more than 90% of their total sales from DIY customers. The addition of the acquired CSK stores predominantly retail sales has resulted in a mix shift of our consolidated sales to approximately 65% DIY and 35% professional installer. In 2009, core O Reilly stores derived approximately 53% of our sales from our DIY customers and approximately 47% from our professional installer customers, while acquired CSK stores derived approximately 84% of sales from our DIY customers and approximately 16% from our professional installer customers. Sales to DIY customers generally have higher gross margin percentages than sales to professional installers as volume discounts are granted on these wholesale transactions to professional installers. In addition, we have added our private label product lines to the acquired CSK stores inventory mix. Private label product sales generally offer better gross margin percentages than sales of corresponding branded products. Improvements in our distribution system were the result of capital projects designed to create operating expense efficiencies. The reductions in commodity prices, without corresponding decreases in retail pricing, that we experienced in 2009 returned to more normal levels by the end of 2009 and we would not anticipate this favorable pricing environment to continue in 2010. Additionally, in conjunction with the opening of our distribution centers in our western markets, we would anticipate a temporary decrease in distribution efficiencies as the new distribution center team members become proficient with the O Reilly distribution systems and as duplicative capacity is removed from the system. SG&A increased $497 million, or 38%, from $1.29 billion (36.1% of sales) in 2008 to $1.79 billion (36.9% of sales) in 2009. The dollar increase in SG&A expenses resulted from a full year inclusion of CSK and new stores. The increase in SG&A expenses as a percentage of sales was attributable to the addition of the acquired CSK stores, which have a higher expense structure than the core O Reilly store base, and the additional store payroll required to complete the ongoing product-line changeovers for acquired CSK stores. These increases were offset by a reduction in duplicative administrative corporate overhead as we continue to transition the CSK headquarters operations in Phoenix, Arizona to our facilities in Springfield, Missouri and increased leverage of fixed costs as a result of the increase in comparable store sales. Interest expense increased $19 million, from $26 million (or 0.7% of sales) in 2008 to $45 million (or 0.9% of sales) in 2009. The increase in interest expense is the result of a full-year of borrowings under our asset-based revolving credit facility in 2009 that was used to fund the acquisition of CSK in 2008, the opening of new stores, ongoing capital expenditures related to the integration of the operations of CSK, the expansion of our distribution infrastructure and the operation of our existing stores slightly offset by more favorable interest rates in 2009 on the non-swapped portion of the outstanding borrowings under our asset-based revolving credit facility which are subject to variable interest rate changes. Other income (expense) for the year ended December 31, 2008, included one-time charges of $4.2 million for interim financing facility commitment fees related to the CSK acquisition and $7.2 million of debt prepayment costs resulting from the payoff of our existing senior notes and synthetic lease facility. Our provision for income taxes increased from $116 million in 2008 (38.4% effective tax rate) to $189 million in 2009 (38.1% effective tax rate). The decrease in effective tax rate is the result of the one-time charge to adjust tax liabilities in 2008 relating to the CSK acquisition, offset by the generally higher effective tax rates in most states where CSK stores are located. The increase in the dollar amount for income taxes was due to the increase in income before income taxes. As a result of the impacts discussed above, net income increased $121 million from $186 million in 2008 (5.2% of sales) to $307 million in 2009 (6.3% of sales). Our diluted earnings per common share for the year ended December 31, 2009, increased 51% to $2.23 on 137.9 million shares compared to $1.48 for the year ended December 31, 2008, on 125.4 million shares. Our year ended December 31, 2008, included one-time and non-cash charges related to the July 11, 2008, acquisition of CSK. These charges included one-time costs for prepayment and extinguishment of our existing debt, commitment fees for an unused interim financing facility, a one-time adjustment to the tax liabilities resulting from the acquisition of CSK, a one-time charge to conform the CSK team member vacation policy with the O Reilly policy and a non-cash charge to amortize the value assigned to CSK trade names and trademarks, which will be amortized 28 Table of Contents over a period coinciding with the anticipated conversion of CSK store locations. Our year ended December 31, 2009, results included a non-cash charge to amortize the value assigned to CSK trade names and trademarks. Adjusted diluted earnings per share, excluding the impact of the acquisition related charges, increased 38% to $2.26 for the year ended December 31, 2009, from $1.64 for the same period one year ago. The table below outlines the impact of the acquisition related charges for the year ended December 31, 2009 and 2008 (in thousands, except per share data): Net Income Diluted Earnings Per Share 2009 2008 2009 2008 Net income and diluted EPS excluding acquisition related charges $ 311,392 $ 205,474 $ 2.26 $ 1.64 Acquisition related charges: Debt prepayment costs, net of tax 4,402 0.04 Commitment fee for interim financing facility, net of tax 2,552 0.02 Adjustments to tax liabilities 3,142 0.02 Charge to conform vacation policies, net of tax 5,879 0.05 Amortization of trade names and trademarks, net of tax 3,894 3,267 0.03 0.03 Net income and diluted EPS $ 307,498 $ 186,232 $ 2.23 $ 1.48 The acquisition-related adjustment to EPS in the above paragraph and table present certain financial information not derived in accordance with GAAP. We do not, nor do we suggest investors should, consider such non-GAAP financial measures in isolation from, or as a substitute for, GAAP financial information. We believe that the presentation of adjusted net income and earnings per share excluding acquisition-related charges provides meaningful supplemental information to both management and investors that is indicative of the Company ongoing core operations. Management excludes these items in judging our performance and believes this non-GAAP information is useful to gain an understanding of the recurring factors and trends affecting our business. Material limitations of this non-GAAP measure are that such measures do not reflect actual GAAP amounts and amortization of acquisition-related trade names and trademarks reflect charges to net income and earnings per share that will recur over the estimated useful lives of the assets ranging from one to three years. We compensate for such limitations by presenting, in the table above, the accompanying reconciliation to the most directly comparable GAAP measures. 2008 Compared to 2007 Sales increased $1.05 billion, or 42%, from $2.52 billion in 2007 to $3.58 billion in 2008, due to the acquisition of 1,342 CSK stores and the addition of 150 net new O Reilly stores opened during 2008. The following table presents the components of the increase in sales for the year ended December 31, 2008 (in millions): Increase in Sales for the Year Ended December 31, 2008, compared to the same period in 2007 Comparable store sales O Reilly stores $ 65.0 Stores opened throughout 2007, excluding stores open at least one year that are included in comparable stores sales 92.3 Sales of stores opened through 2008 61.8 Non-store sales including machinery, sales to independent part stores and team members (1.1 ) Acquired CSK stores 836.2 Total increase in sales $ 1,054.2 We believe that the increased sales achieved by our existing stores is the result of superior inventory availability, a broader selection of products in most stores, targeted promotional and advertising efforts through a variety of media and localized promotional events, continued improvement in the merchandising and layout of stores, compensation programs for all store team members that provide incentives for performance and our continued focus on serving professional installers. Consolidated comparable store sales for stores open at least one year increased 1.5% for the year ended December 31, 2008. This increase in 2008 was less than the prior year increase of 3.7% and historical trends primarily due to challenging external macroeconomic factors in 2008 as well as a decline in comparable store sales in the stores added in the CSK acquisition. The external macroeconomic factors which we believe negatively impacted our sales were constraints on our customers discretionary income resulting from inflation, declining home and investment asset values, higher gas prices in early 2008, increased unemployment and the impact of a contraction in the US economy. 29 Table of Contents Comparable store sales for O Reilly stores, including CSK stores after conversion to the O Reilly brand, but excluding the acquired, yet-to-be-converted CSK stores, increased 2.6% for the year ended December 31, 2008. Comparable store sales for acquired CSK stores open at least one year decreased 1.7% for the portion of those stores sales since the July 11, 2008 acquisition by O Reilly as compared to the same period in 2007 when CSK sales were not included in our consolidated financial statements. We anticipate that continued store unit and sales growth consistent with our historical rates will continue in the future. We expect future sales growth as the CSK stores are converted to the O Reilly dual market strategy. Comparable store sales are calculated based on the change in sales of stores open at least one year and exclude sales of specialty machinery, sales to independent parts stores and sales to team members. Gross profit increased $508 million, or 45%, from $1.12 billion (44.4% of sales) in 2007 to $1.63 billion (45.5% of sales) in 2008. The increase in gross profit dollars was primarily the result of the increase in sales resulting from the acquisition of CSK, the increase from new stores and increased sales levels at existing stores. The increase in gross profit as a percentage of sales is the result of improved product mix, lower product acquisition cost and distribution system improvements. We improved our product mix by continuing to implement strategies to differentiate our merchandise selections at each store based on customer demand and vehicle demographics in the store market and through ongoing Team Member training initiatives focused on selling products with greater gross margin contribution. Additionally, gross margin percentage improved as a result of the inclusion of sales from stores acquired in the acquisition of CSK. Gross margin percentages on the sales at these stores are higher than existing O Reilly stores primarily because a greater proportion of these sales are made to DIY customers (which typically have higher gross margin percentages) and because of market conditions, primarily overall price levels, which are specific to the markets in which the acquired stores are located. Product acquisition costs improved due to increased production by our suppliers in lower-cost foreign countries and improved negotiating leverage with our vendors as a result of our significant growth. Improvements in our distribution system were the result of capital projects designed to create operating expense efficiencies. SG&A increased $477 million, or 59%, from $815 million (32.3% of sales) in 2007 to $1.29 billion (36.1% of sales) in 2008. The dollar increase in SG&A expenses resulted primarily from the acquisition of CSK and from additional team members and resources to support our increased store count. The increase in SG&A expenses as a percentage of sales was primarily due to the addition of the CSK store base which has a higher expense structure than the core O Reilly store base, a one-time charge of $9.6 million to align CSK vacation policy with the Company policy, $5.3 million of non-cash amortization of CSK trade names and trademarks and partial de-leverage of fixed SG&A expenses on low comparable store sales increases. Interest expense increased $22 million, from $4 million (or 0.1% of sales) in 2007 to $26 million (or 0.7% of sales) in 2008. The increase in interest expense is the result of borrowings under our new asset-based revolving credit facility that were used to fund the CSK acquisition as well as amortization of a portion of the debt issuance costs. Other one-time charges were incurred in 2008 of $4.2 million for interim financing facility commitment fees related to the CSK acquisition and $7.2 million of debt prepayment costs resulting from the payoff of our existing senior notes and synthetic lease facility. Our provision for income taxes increased from $114 million in 2007 (36.9% effective tax rate) to $116 million in 2008 (38.4% effective tax rate). The increase in effective tax rate is the result of our acquisition of CSK and the generally higher effective tax rates in most states where the acquired CSK stores are located. The increase is also attributable to a one-time charge to adjust tax liabilities in the amount $3.1 million relating to the acquisition. As a result of the impacts discussed above, net income decreased $8 million from $194 million in 2007 (7.7% of sales) to $186 million in 2008 (5.2% of sales). Diluted earnings per share decreased $0.19 per share in 2008 to $1.48 per share on 125.4 million diluted shares outstanding from $1.67 per share in 2007 on 116.1 million diluted shares outstanding. The increase in dilutive shares outstanding is principally the result of shares exchanged in the acquisition of CSK. 30 Table of Contents LIQUIDITY AND CAPITAL RESOURCES The following table highlights our liquidity and related ratios for the years ended December 31, 2009 and 2008, as well as our cash flows from operating, investing and financing activities for the fiscal years ended December 31, 2009, 2008 and 2007 ($ in thousands): Year Ended Liquidity and Related Ratios December 31, 2009 December 31, 2008 Percentage Change Current assets $ 2,227 $ 1,875 18.8 % Quick assets (1) 198 197 0.5 % Current liabilities 1,231 1,054 16.8 % Working capital (2) 995 822 21.0 % Total debt 791 733 7.9 % Total equity 2,686 2,282 17.7 % Current ratio (3) 1.81:1 1.78:1 1.7 % Quick ratio (4) 0.25:1 0.29:1 (13.8 )% Debt to equity (5) 0.29 0.32 (9.4 )% Year Ended Liquidity December 31, 2009 December 31, 2008 December 31, 2007 Total cash provided by (used in): Operating activities $ 285,200 $ 298,542 $ 299,418 Investing activities (410,661 ) (367,597 ) (300,318 ) Financing activities 121,095 52,801 18,552 Increase (decrease) in cash and cash equivalents $ (4,366 ) $ (16,254 ) $ 17,652 (1) Quick assets includes cash, cash equivalents and receivables. (2) Working capital is calculated as current assets less current liabilities. (3) Current ratio is calculated as current assets divided by current liabilities. (4) Quick ratio is calculated as current assets, less inventories, divided by current liabilities. ( 5 ) Debt to equity is calculated as total debt divided by total shareholders equity. Liquidity and Related Ratios Current assets increased 19% from 2008 to 2009, primarily driven by increased investment in inventory as part of the process to properly align the acquired CSK stores with O Reilly branded stores inventory levels and selection. Current liabilities increased 17% from 2008 to 2009, primarily attributable to the presentation of our acquired 6 3 / 4 % Exchangeable Notes as short-term debt, due to the Noteholders right to require our repurchase of the Notes in 2010, and an increase in accounts payable stemming from our increased inventory investment. Total working capital increased 21% from 2008 to 2009, principally as a result of our investment in inventory, offset by the related increase in accounts payable as discussed above. Total debt increased 8% and total equity increased 18% from 2008 to 2009. The increase in debt is primarily attributable to increased borrowing levels under our ABL Facility to support the integration and conversion of CSK. The increase in total equity is principally due to a 23% increase in retained earnings resulting from net income in 2009 and an increase in additional paid-in capital of 10% primarily from the issuance of common stock upon the exercise of stock options. Operating Activities Net cash provided by operating activities was $285 million in 2009, $299 million in 2008 and $299 million in 2007. The decrease in net cash provided by operating activities in 2009 compared to 2008 was principally due to an increase in net inventory investment in 2009, which was slightly offset by an increase in operating income adjusted for non-cash depreciation and amortization expenses. Net cash provided by operating activities in 2008 was flat with the cash provided by operating activities in 2007 principally because an increase in net inventory investment in 2008 was offset by an increase in operating income adjusted for non-cash depreciation and amortization expenses, and a one-time non-cash charge of $9.6 million to align, where possible, CSK vacation policy with the Company policy. Net inventory investment reflects our investment in inventory net of the amount of accounts payable to vendors. The increases in net inventory investment in 2008 and 2009 were the result of investments made to improve the inventory availability in the stores acquired in the acquisition of CSK. The average per-store inventory for core O Reilly stores increased to $498,000 as of December 31, 2009, from $489,000 as of December 31, 2008. Nonconverted CSK store average per-store inventory increased to $595,000 as of December 31, 2009, from $461,000 as of December 31, 2008. Investing Activities Net cash used in investing activities was $411 million in 2009, $368 million in 2008 and $300 million in 2007. Increases in cash used in investing activities in both 2009 and 2008 was primarily due to an increase in capital expenditures related to conversions of acquired CSK stores to the O Reilly Brand and additional distribution centers. Capital expenditures were $415 million in 2009, $342 million in 31 Table of Contents 2008, and $283 million in 2007. The increase in cash used in investing activities in 2009 compared to 2008, was due to the purchase of two distribution center facilities and land for an additional distribution center in our western markets to enhance the distribution infrastructure, the conversion of 354 acquired CSK stores to O Reilly systems. The increase in cash used in investing activities in 2008 compared to 2007 was principally due to an increase in capital expenditures and payments made in association with the acquisition and in the integration of CSK, partially offset by decreased capital expenditures for new store construction. We opened 150, 150, and 190 net stores in 2009, 2008 and 2007, respectively. In 2010, we plan to open 150 new stores, convert 888 acquired CSK stores to O Reilly systems, open three new distribution centers in the west, relocate and convert an existing acquired CSK distribution center to O Reilly systems and convert an existing acquired CSK distribution center to O Reilly systems. The costs associated with the opening of a new store (including the cost of land acquisition, improvements, fixtures, net inventory investment and computer equipment) are estimated to average approximately $1.3 million to $1.5 million; however, such costs may be significantly reduced where we lease, rather than purchase, the store site. Capital costs associated with the conversion of CSK stores include investments in store computer systems, signage, fixtures, interior and exterior renovation, and delivery vehicles. The average estimated capital conversion cost per store is expected to be approximately $135,000. Total capital expenditures in 2010 are expected to range from $400 million to $450 million. Financing Activities Net cash provided by financing activities was $121 million in 2009, $53 million in 2008 and $19 million in 2007. The increase in cash provided by financing activities in 2009 was the result of a reduction in payments on long term debt in 2009 compared to 2008 primarily relating to the payment of outstanding principal balances on existing debt, debt issuance costs and prepayment costs in association with the financing of the acquisition of CSK in 2008 and an increase in the net proceeds from the issuance of common stock related to our stock option plans along with the increase in the associated tax benefit from the exercises partially offset by reduced borrowings under our asset-based credit facility. The increase in cash provided by financing activities in 2008 was the result of the proceeds from borrowings under our asset-based credit facility, which was partially offset by the payment of outstanding principal balances on existing debt and debt assumed in the CSK acquisition, debt issuance costs and prepayment costs in association with the financing of the acquisition of CSK. Sources of Liquidity Our current business strategy requires capital to open new stores, convert acquired CSK stores, expand distribution infrastructure and operate existing stores. The primary sources of our liquidity are funds generated from operations and borrowed under our ABL Credit Facility. Decreased demand for our products or changes in customer buying patterns could negatively impact our ability to generate funds from operations. Additionally, decreased demand or changes in buying patterns could impact our ability to meet the debt covenants of our Credit Agreement and therefore negatively impact the funds available under our ABL Credit Facility. In 2010, we plan to open 150 new stores and open three new distribution centers in our Western markets. We also plan to relocate an existing acquired CSK distribution center in Northern California to a larger facility and plan to convert our acquired Phoenix distribution center to O Reilly systems. In addition, we plan to convert 888 acquired CSK stores to O Reilly systems in 2010. We believe that cash expected to be provided by operating activities and availability under our ABL Credit Facility will be sufficient to fund both our short-term and long-term capital and liquidity needs for the foreseeable future. However, if our liquidity is insufficient, we may be forced to limit our planned expansion in 2010. There can be no assurance that we will continue to generate cash flows at or above recent levels. Credit Facility On July 11, 2008, in connection with the acquisition of CSK, we entered into a Credit Agreement for a five-year $1.2 billion asset-based revolving credit facility ( ABL Credit Facility ) arranged by Bank of America, N.A., which we used to refinance debt, fund the cash portion of the acquisition, pay for other transaction-related expenses and provide liquidity for the combined Company going forward. This facility replaced a previous unsecured, five-year syndicated revolving credit facility in the amount of $100 million. The ABL Credit Facility is comprised of a $1.075 billion tranche A revolving credit facility and a $125.0 million first-in-last-out revolving credit facility (FILO tranche). On the date of the transaction, the amount of the borrowing base available, as described in the ABL Credit Agreement, under the ABL Credit Facility was $1.05 billion of which we borrowed $588 million. We used borrowings under the ABL Credit Facility to repay certain existing debt of CSK, repay our $75 million 2006-A Senior Notes and purchase all of the properties that had been leased under our synthetic lease facility. As of December 31, 2009 and 2008, the amount of the borrowing base available under the credit facility was $1.2 billion and $1.1 billion, respectively, of which we had outstanding borrowings of $679 million and $614 million, respectively. The available borrowings under the credit facility are also reduced by stand-by letters of credit issued by us primarily to satisfy the requirements of workers compensation, general liability and other insurance policies. As of December 31, 2009 and 2008, we had stand-by letters of credit outstanding in the amount of $72 million and $56 million, respectively, and the aggregate availability for additional borrowings under the credit facility was $445 million and $454 million, respectively. As part of the Credit Agreement, we have pledged substantially all of our assets as collateral and we are subject to an ongoing consolidated leverage ratio covenant, with which we complied on December 31, 2009 and 2008. In the event that we should default on any covenant contained within the Credit Agreement, certain actions may be taken; these actions include, but are not limited to, the summarized items below: 32 Table of Contents termination of credit extensions; any outstanding principal amount plus accrued interest could become immediately payable; cash collateralization of all letter of credit obligations; and/or litigation from lenders. Borrowings under the tranche A revolver bear interest, at our option, at a rate equal to either a base rate plus 1.25% per annum or LIBOR plus 2.25% per annum, with each rate being subject to adjustment based upon certain excess availability thresholds. Borrowings under the FILO tranche bear interest, at our option, at a rate equal to either a base rate plus 2.5% per annum or LIBOR plus 3.5% per annum, with each rate being subject to adjustment based upon certain excess availability thresholds. The base rate is equal to the higher of the prime lending rate established by Bank of America from time to time and the federal funds effective rate as in effect from time to time plus 1.25%. Fees related to unused capacity under the ABL Credit Facility are assessed at a rate of 0.375% of the remaining available borrowings under the facility, subject to adjustment based upon remaining unused capacity. In addition, we paid customary commitment fees, letter of credit fees, underwriting fees and other administrative fees in respect of the credit facility. On July 24, 2008, October 14, 2008, November 24, 2008, and January 21, 2010, we entered into interest rate swap transactions with BBT, BA, SunTrust and/or Barclays. We entered into these interest rate swap transactions to mitigate the risk associated with our floating interest rate based on LIBOR on an aggregate of $500 million of our debt that is outstanding under our ABL Credit Agreement, dated as of July 11, 2008. We are required to make certain monthly fixed rate payments calculated on the notional amounts, while the applicable counter party is obligated to make certain monthly floating rate payments to us referencing the same notional amount. The interest rate swap transactions effectively fix the annual interest rate payable on these notional amounts of our debt, which exists under the Credit Agreement plus an applicable margin under the terms of the same credit facility. The interest rate swap transactions have maturity dates ranging from August 1, 2010, through October 17, 2011. The interest rate swap transaction we entered into with SunTrust on November 24, 2008, was for $50 million and matured on November 28, 2009, increasing our exposure to changes in interest rates on a total notional amount of $400 million as of December 31, 2009. On January 21, 2010 we entered into an interest rate swap transaction with Barclays in the amount of $50 million, reducing our exposure to changes in interest rates on a total notional amount of $450 million as of that date. Senior Exchangeable Notes On July 11, 2008, we agreed to become a guarantor, on a subordinated basis, of the $100 million principal amount of 6 3 / 4 % Exchangeable Senior Notes due 2025 (the Notes ) originally issued by CSK. The Notes are exchangeable, under certain circumstances, into cash and shares of our common stock. The Notes bear interest at 6.75% per year until December 15, 2010, and 6.50% until maturity on December 15, 2025. Prior to their stated maturity, the Notes are exchangeable by the holders only under the following circumstances (as more fully described in the indenture under which the Notes were issued): during any fiscal quarter (and only during that fiscal quarter) commencing after July 11, 2008, if the last reported sale price of our common stock is greater than or equal to 130% of the applicable exchange price of $36.17 for at least 20 trading days in the period of 30 consecutive trading days; if we have called the Notes for redemption; or upon the occurrence of specified corporate transactions, such as a change in control. Upon exchange of the Notes, we will deliver cash equal to the lesser of the aggregate principal amount of Notes to be exchanged and our total exchange obligation and, in the event our total exchange obligation exceeds the aggregate principal amount of Notes to be exchanged, shares of our common stock in respect of that excess. The total exchange obligation reflects the exchange rate whereby each $1,000 in principal amount of the Notes is exchangeable into an equivalent value of 25.9697 shares of our common stock and $60.6061 in cash. The incremental net shares for the Notes exchange feature were included in the diluted earnings per share calculation for the year ended December 31, 2009, however the incremental net shares for the Notes exchange feature were not included in the diluted earnings per share calculation for the year ended December 31, 2008, as the impact would have been antidilutive. The Noteholders may require us to repurchase some or all of the Notes for cash at a repurchase price equal to 100% of the principal amount of the Notes being repurchased, plus any accrued and unpaid interest on December 15, 2010; December 15, 2015; or December 15, 2020, or on any date following a fundamental change as described in the indenture. We may redeem some or all of the Notes for cash at a redemption price of 100% of the principal amount plus any accrued and unpaid interest on or after December 15, 2010, upon at least 35-calendar days notice. Our intention is to redeem the Notes in December of 2010, and we plan to fund the redemption with available borrowings under our ABL Credit Facility. 33 Table of Contents OFF BALANCE SHEET ARRANGEMENTS Off balance sheet arrangements are transactions, agreements, or other contractual arrangements with an unconsolidated entity for which we have an obligation to the entity that is not recorded in our consolidated financial statements. We have utilized various off balance sheet financial instruments from time to time as sources of cash when such instruments provided a cost-effective alternative to our existing sources of cash. We do not believe, however, that we are dependent on the availability of these instruments to fund our working capital requirements or our growth plans. On December 29, 2000, we entered into a sale-leaseback transaction with an unrelated party. Under the terms of the transaction, we sold 90 properties, including land, buildings and improvements, which generated $52.3 million of cash. The lease, which is being accounted for as an operating lease, provides for an initial lease term of 21 years and may be extended for one initial ten-year period and two additional successive periods of five years each. The resulting gain of $4.5 million has been deferred and is being amortized over the initial lease term. Net rent expense during the initial term is approximately $5.5 million annually. In August 2001, we entered into a sale-leaseback with O Reilly-Wooten 2000 LLC (an entity owned by certain affiliates of the Company). The transaction involved the sale and leaseback of nine O Reilly Auto Parts stores and generated approximately $5.6 million of cash. The transaction did not result in a material gain or loss. The lease, which has been accounted for as an operating lease, calls for an initial term of 15 years with three five-year renewal options. On September 28, 2007, we completed a second amended and restated master agreement to our $49 million Synthetic Operating Lease Facility with a group of financial institutions. The terms of such lease facility provided for an initial lease period of seven years, a residual value guarantee of approximately $39.7 million at December 31, 2007 and purchase options on the properties. On July 11, 2008, in connection with the acquisition of CSK, we purchased all the properties included in our Synthetic Operating Lease Facility for $49.3 million, thus terminating the facility. The purchase was funded through borrowings under the ABL Credit Facility. On July 11, 2008, and as a result of the acquisition, we entered into a master lease agreement with ARI Fleet LT ( ARI ), which was originally entered into on March 19, 2001, by CSK. The lease agreement with ARI is for the lease of all of CSK delivery and management vehicles, which is accounted for as a capital lease. Under the master agreement, a lease contract is created on each vehicle, with terms typically ranging from 50 to 60 months. Interest expense on the capital lease totaled $0.3 million for each of the years ended December 31, 2009 and 2008. At December 31, 2009 and 2008, the book value of the ARI master lease agreement was $3.9 million and $7.4 million, respectively. We issue stand-by letters of credit provided by a $200 million sub limit under the ABL Credit Facility that reduce our available borrowings. These letters of credit are issued primarily to satisfy the requirements of workers compensation, general liability and other insurance policies. Substantially all of the outstanding letters of credit have a one-year term from the date of issuance. Letters of credit totaling $72.3 million and $55.6 million were outstanding at December 31, 2009 and 2008, respectively. 34 Table of Contents CONTRACTUAL OBLIGATIONS Deferred income taxes, self-insurance accruals, interest payments on our variable rate long-term debt and commitments with various vendors for the purchase of inventory are included in Other liabilities on our consolidated balance sheets and are not reflected in the table below due to the absence of scheduled maturities, the nature of the account or the commitment cancellation terms. Due to the absence of scheduled maturities, the timing of certain of these payments cannot be determined, except for amounts estimated to be payable in 2010, which are included in Current liabilities on our consolidated balance sheets. Our contractual obligations at December 31, 2009, included commitments for future payments under noncancelable lease arrangements, short and long-term debt arrangements, interest payments related to long-term debt, fixed payments related to interest rate swaps and purchase obligations for construction contract commitments, which are summarized in the table below and are fully disclosed in Note 4 Long-Term Debt and Note 6 Commitments to the consolidated financial statements. We expect to fund these commitments primarily with operating cash flows generated in the normal course of business, through borrowings under our ABL Credit Facility or through future borrowings. Payments Due By Period Total Before 1 Year 1 to 2 Years 3 to 4 Years Years 5 and Over (In thousands) Contractual Obligations: Long-term debt $ 778,800 $ 100,000 $ $ 678,800 $ Payments under interest rate swap agreements 16,646 11,900 4,746 Interest rate payments under 6 3 / 4 % Exchangeable Senior Notes 103,954 6,739 13,000 13,000 71,215 Future minimum lease payments under capital leases 12,327 6,455 4,343 1,202 327 Future minimum lease payments under operating leases 1,501,522 214,087 377,053 278,242 632,140 Other obligations 4,200 600 1,200 1,200 1,200 Purchase obligations 102,556 102,556 Total contractual cash obligations $ 2,520,005 $ 442,337 $ 400,342 $ 972,444 $ 704,882 We may redeem some or all of the Notes for cash at a redemption price of 100% of the principal amount plus any accrued and unpaid interest on or after December 15, 2010, upon at least 35-calendar days notice. Our intention is to redeem the Notes in December of 2010, and we plan to fund the redemption with available borrowings under our ABL Credit Facility. CRITICAL ACCOUNTING ESTIMATES The preparation of our financial statements in accordance with accounting policies generally accepted in the United States ( GAAP ) requires the application of certain estimates and judgments by management. Management bases its assumptions, estimates, and adjustments on historical experience, current trends and other factors believed to be relevant at the time the consolidated financial statements are prepared. Management believes that the following policies are critical due to the inherent uncertainty of these matters and the complex and subjective judgments required to establish these estimates. Management continues to review these critical accounting policies and estimates to ensure that the consolidated financial statements are presented fairly in accordance with GAAP. However, actual results could differ from our assumptions and estimates and such differences could be material. Vendor concessions We receive concessions from our vendors through a variety of programs and arrangements, including co-operative advertising, allowances for warranties, merchandise allowances and volume purchase rebates. Co-operative advertising allowances that are incremental to our advertising program, specific to a product or event and identifiable for accounting purposes, are reported as a reduction of advertising expense in the period in which the advertising occurred. All other material vendor concessions are recognized as a reduction to the cost of inventory. Amounts receivable from vendors also include amounts due to us relating to vendor purchases and product returns. Management regularly reviews amounts receivable from vendors and assesses the need for a reserve for uncollectible amounts based on our evaluation of our vendors financial position and corresponding ability to meet their financial obligations. Based on our historical results and current assessment, we have not recorded a reserve for uncollectible amounts in our consolidated financial statements, and we do not believe there is a reasonable likelihood that our ability to collect these amounts will differ from our expectations. The eventual ability of our vendors to pay us the obliged amounts could differ from our assumptions and estimates, and we may be exposed to losses or gains that could be material. 35 Table of Contents Self-Insurance Reserves We use a combination of insurance and self-insurance mechanisms to provide for potential liabilities from workers compensation, general liability, vehicle liability, property loss, and employee health care benefits. With the exception of employee health care benefit liabilities, which are limited by the design of these plans, we obtain third-party insurance coverage to limit our exposure for any individual workers compensation, general liability, vehicle liability or property loss claim. When estimating our self-insurance liabilities, we consider a number of factors, including historical claims experience and trend-lines, projected medical and legal inflation, and growth patterns and exposure forecasts. The assumptions made by management as they relate to each of these factors represent our judgment as to the most probable cumulative impact of each factor to our future obligations. Our calculation of self-insurance liabilities requires management to apply judgment to estimate the ultimate cost to settle reported claims and claims incurred but not yet reported as of the balance sheet date and the application of alternative assumptions could result in a different estimate of these liabilities. Actual claim activity or development may vary from our assumptions and estimates, which may result in material losses or gains. As we obtain additional information that affects the assumptions and estimates we used to recognize liabilities for claims incurred in prior accounting periods, we adjust our self-insurance liabilities to reflect the revised estimates based on this additional information. These liabilities are recorded at our estimate of their net present value. These liabilities do not have scheduled maturities, but we can estimate the timing of future payments based upon historical patterns. We could apply alternative assumptions regarding the timing of payments or the applicable discount rate that could result in materially different estimates of the net present value of the liabilities. If self-insurance reserves were changed 10% from our estimated reserves at December 31, 2009, the financial impact would have been approximately $9.1 million or 1.8% of pretax income for the year ended December 31, 2009. Accounts Receivable We provide credit to our commercial customers in the ordinary course of business. We estimate the allowance for doubtful accounts on these receivables based on historical loss ratios and other relevant factors. Actual results have consistently been within management expectations, and we do not believe there is a reasonable likelihood that there will be a material change in the future that will require a significant change in the assumptions or estimates we use to calculate our allowance for doubtful accounts. However, if actual results differ from our estimates, we may be exposed to losses or gains. If the allowance for doubtful accounts were changed 10% from our estimated allowance at December 31, 2009, the financial impact would have been approximately $0.7 million or 0.1% of pretax income for the year ended December 31, 2009. Taxes We operate within multiple taxing jurisdictions and are subject to audit in these jurisdictions. These audits can involve complex issues, which may require an extended period of time to resolve. We regularly review our potential tax liabilities for tax years subject to audit. The amount of such liabilities is based on various factors, such as differing interpretations of tax regulations by the responsible tax authority, experience with previous tax audits and applicable tax law rulings. Changes in our tax liability may occur in the future as our assessments change based on the progress of tax examinations in various jurisdictions and/or changes in tax regulations. In management opinion, adequate provisions for income taxes have been made for all years presented. The estimates of our potential tax liabilities contain uncertainties because management must use judgment to estimate the exposures associated with our various tax positions and actual results could differ from our estimates. Alternatively, we could have applied assumptions regarding the eventual outcome of the resolution of open tax positions that could differ from our current estimates but that would still be reasonable given the nature of a particular position. Our judgment regarding the most likely outcome of uncertain tax positions has historically resulted in an estimate of our tax liability that is greater than actual results. While our estimates are subject to the uncertainty noted in the preceding discussion, our initial estimates of our potential tax liabilities have historically not been materially different from actual results except in instances where we have reversed liabilities that were recorded for periods that were subsequently closed with the applicable taxing authority. Inventory Obsolescence and Shrink Inventory, which consists of automotive hard parts, maintenance items, accessories and tools, is stated at the lower of cost or market. The extended nature of the life cycle of our products is such that the risk of obsolescence of our inventory is minimal. The products that we sell generally have applications in our markets for a relatively long period of time in conjunction with the corresponding vehicle population. We have developed sophisticated systems for monitoring the life cycle of a given product and, accordingly, have historically been very successful in adjusting the volume of our inventory in conjunction with a decrease in demand. We do record a reserve to reduce the carrying value of our inventory through a charge to cost of sales in the isolated instances where we believe that the market value of a product line is lower than our recorded cost. This reserve is based on our assumptions about the marketability of our existing inventory and is subject to uncertainty to the extent that we must estimate, at a given point in time, the market value of inventory that will be sold in future periods. Ultimately, our projections could differ from actual results and could result in a material impact to our stated inventory balances. We have historically not had to materially adjust our obsolescence reserves due to the factors discussed above and do not anticipate that we will experience material changes in our estimates in the future. We also record a reserve to reduce the carrying value of our perpetual inventory to account for quantities in our perpetual records above the actual existing quantities on hand caused by unrecorded shrink. We estimate this reserve based on the results of our extensive and frequent cycle counting programs and periodic, full physical inventories at our stores and distribution centers. To 36 Table of Contents the extent that our estimates do not accurately reflect the actual unrecorded inventory shrinkage, we could potentially experience a material impact to our inventory balances. We have historically been able to provide a timely and accurate measurement of shrink and have not experienced material adjustments to our estimates. If unrecorded shrink were changed 10% from the estimate that we recorded based on our historical experience at December 31, 2009, the financial impact would have been approximately $1.2 million or 0.3% of pretax income for the year ended December 31, 2009. Valuation of Long-Lived Assets and Goodwill We evaluate the carrying value of long-lived assets whenever events or changes in circumstances indicate that a potential impairment has occurred. As part of the evaluation, we review performance at the store level to identify any stores with current period operating losses that should be considered for impairment. A potential impairment has occurred if the projected future undiscounted cash flows realized from the best possible use of the asset are less than the carrying value of the asset. The estimate of cash flows includes management assumptions of cash inflows and outflows directly resulting from the use of that asset in operations. If the carrying amount of an asset exceeds its estimated future cash flows, an impairment charge is recognized for the amount by which the carrying amount of the asset exceeds the fair value of the assets. Our impairment analyses contain estimates due to the inherently judgmental nature of forecasting long-term estimated cash flows and determining the ultimate useful lives and fair values of the assets. Actual results could differ from these estimates, which could materially impact our impairment assessment. We review goodwill and other intangible assets for impairment annually on December 31, or when events or changes in circumstances indicate the carrying value of these assets might exceed their current fair values. We have not historically recorded an impairment to our goodwill or intangible assets. The process of evaluating goodwill for impairment involves the determination of the fair value of our Company using the market approach. Inherent in such fair value determinations are certain judgments and estimates, including estimates which incorporate assumptions marketplace participants would use in making their estimates of fair value. In the future, if events or market conditions affect the estimated fair value to the extent that an asset is impaired, we will adjust the carrying value of these assets in the period in which the impairment occurs, however, we do not believe there has been any change of events or circumstances that would indicate that a reevaluation of goodwill or other intangible assets is required as of December 31, 2009, nor do we believe goodwill or any other intangible assets are at risk of failing impairment testing. If the price of O Reilly stock, which was a primary input used to determine the Company market capitalization during step one of goodwill impairment testing, changed by 10% from the value used during testing, the results and our conclusions would not have changed and no further steps would have been required. Closed Property Reserves We maintain reserves for closed stores and other properties that are no longer utilized in current operations. We accrue for closed property operating lease liabilities using a credit-adjusted discount rate to calculate the present value of the remaining noncancelable lease payments, contractual occupancy costs and lease termination fees after the closing date, net of estimated sublease income. The closed property lease liabilities are expected to be paid over the remaining lease terms. We estimate sublease income and future cash flows based on our experience and knowledge of the market in which the closed property is located, our previous efforts to dispose of similar assets and existing economic conditions. Adjustments to closed property reserves are made to reflect changes in estimated sublease income or actual exit costs from original estimates. Adjustments are made for changes in estimates in the period in which the changes become known. If closed property reserves were changed 10% from our estimated reserves at December 31, 2009, the financial impact would have been approximately $2.3 million or 0.5% of pretax income for the year ended December 31, 2009. Legal Reserves We maintain reserves for expenses associated with litigation for which O Reilly is currently involved. We are currently involved in litigation incidental to the ordinary conduct of our business as well as resolving the governmental investigations that are being conducted against CSK and litigation commenced against its former employees for alleged conduct relating to periods prior to the acquisition date. As a result of the acquisition, we expect to continue to incur ongoing legal fees related to such investigations, litigation and indemnity obligations. Our legal reserve was principally recorded as an assumed liability in our allocation of the purchase price of CSK, which was finalized on June 30, 2009. Management, with the assistance of outside legal counsel, must make estimates of potential legal obligations and possible liabilities arising from such litigation and records reserves for these expenditures. If legal reserves were changed 10% from our estimated reserves at December 31, 2009, the financial impact would have been approximately $2.4 million or 0.5% of pretax income for the year ended December 31, 2009. INFLATION AND SEASONALITY For the last three fiscal years, we have been successful, in many cases, in reducing the effects of merchandise cost increases principally by taking advantage of vendor incentive programs, economies of scale resulting from increased volume of purchases and selective forward buying. To the extent our acquisition cost increased due to base commodity price increases industry-wide, we have typically been able to pass along these increased costs through higher retail prices for the affected products. As a result, we do not believe our operations have been materially, adversely affected by inflation. 37 Table of Contents To some extent, our business is seasonal primarily as a result of the impact of weather conditions on customer buying patterns. While we have historically realized operating profits in each quarter of the year, our store sales and profits have historically been higher in the second and third quarters (April through September) than in the first and fourth quarters of the year. QUARTERLY RESULTS The following table sets forth certain quarterly unaudited operating data for fiscal 2009 and 2008. The unaudited quarterly information includes all adjustments which management considers necessary for a fair presentation of the information shown. The unaudited operating data presented below should be read in conjunction with our consolidated financial statements and related notes included elsewhere in this annual report, and the other financial information included therein. Fiscal 2009 First Quarter Second Quarter Third Quarter Fourth Quarter (In thousands, except per share data) Sales $ 1,163,749 $ 1,251,377 $ 1,258,239 $ 1,173,697 Gross profit 542,670 603,769 610,555 569,534 Operating income 113,336 149,675 149,196 125,412 Net income 62,835 85,515 87,225 71,923 Basic net income per common share 0.47 0.63 0.64 0.52 Net income per common share assuming dilution 0.46 0.62 0.63 0.52 Fiscal 2008 First Quarter Second Quarter Third Quarter Fourth Quarter (In thousands, except per share data) Sales $ 646,220 $ 704,430 $ 1,111,272 $ 1,114,631 Gross profit 288,494 317,097 507,206 515,129 Operating income 74,156 88,388 92,471 80,602 Net income 46,331 55,788 41,399 42,714 Basic net income per common share 0.40 0.48 0.31 0.32 Net income per common share assuming dilution 0.40 0.48 0.31 0.32 RECENT ACCOUNTING PRONOUNCEMENTS In December 2007, the Financial Accounting Standards Board ( FASB ) issued the Consolidation Topic ( ASC 810 ) of the FASB ASC, which is effective for fiscal years beginning after December 15, 2008. ASC 810 states that accounting and reporting for minority interests will be recharacterized as noncontrolling interests and classified as a component of equity. The calculation of earnings per share will continue to be based on income amounts attributable to the parent. ASC 810 applies to all entities that prepare consolidated financial statements, but will affect only those entities that have an outstanding noncontrolling interest in one or more subsidiaries or that deconsolidate a subsidiary. The provisions of ASC 810 were effective for us beginning January 1, 2009, and are applied prospectively. The adoption of ASC 810 did not have a material impact on our consolidated financial position, results of operations or cash flows. In March 2008, the FASB issued the Derivatives and Hedging Topic ( ASC 815 ) of the FASB ASC, which requires entities that utilize derivative instruments to provide qualitative disclosures about their objectives and strategies for using such instruments, as well as any details of credit-risk-related contingent features contained within derivatives. ASC 815 also requires entities to disclose additional information about the amounts and location of derivatives located within the financial statements, how the provisions of ASC 815 have been applied, and the impact that hedges have on an entity financial position, financial performance and cash flows. ASC 815 is effective for fiscal years and interim periods beginning after November 15, 2008, with early application encouraged. We have adopted the provisions of ASC 815 beginning with our condensed consolidated financial statements for the quarter ended March 31, 2009. In May 2008, the FASB issued the Debt with Conversions and Other Options Topic ( ASC 470 ) of the FASB ASC, which clarifies the accounting for convertible debt instruments that may be settled in cash (including partial cash settlement) upon conversion and specifies that issuers of such instruments should separately account for the liability and equity components of certain convertible debt instruments in a manner that reflects the issuer nonconvertible debt borrowing rate when interest cost is recognized in subsequent 38 Table of Contents periods. ASC 470 requires bifurcation of a component of the debt, classification of that component in equity if certain criteria are met and the accretion of the resulting discount on the debt to be recognized as part of interest expense in our Consolidated Statement of Operations. ASC 470 is effective for fiscal years and interim periods beginning after December 15, 2008, with early application prohibited. We adopted the provisions of ASC 470 beginning with our condensed consolidated financial statements for the quarter ended March 31, 2009; however, the retrospective adoption of ASC 470 did not have a material impact on our consolidated financial position, results of operations or cash flows. See Note 4 Long-Term Debt to the consolidated financial statements. In April 2009, the FASB issued the Financial Instruments Topic ( ASC 825 ) of the FASB ASC. This Topic requires quarterly disclosure of the methods and significant assumptions used to estimate the fair values of all financial instruments, and is effective for interim and annual periods ended after June 15, 2009. We adopted the provisions of ASC 825 beginning with our condensed consolidated financial statements for the quarter ended June 30, 2009. The application of this guidance affects disclosures only and therefore did not have an impact on our financial condition, results of operations or cash flows. In May 2009, the FASB issued the Subsequent Events Topic ( ASC 855 ) of the FASB ASC. ASC 855 incorporates into authoritative accounting literature certain guidance that already existed within generally accepted auditing standards. ASC 855 addresses events which occur after the balance sheet date but before the issuance of financial statements. Under ASC 855, as under current practice, an entity must record the effects of subsequent events that provide evidence about conditions that existed at the balance sheet date and must disclose, but not record, the effects of subsequent events which provide evidence about conditions that did not exist at the balance sheet date. In addition, ASC 855 requires disclosure of the date through which an entity has evaluated subsequent events and the basis for that date. ASC 855 is effective for interim and annual periods ended after June 15, 2009. We adopted the provisions of ASC 855 beginning with our condensed consolidated financial statements for the quarter ended June 30, 2009. In June 2009, the FASB issued the Generally Accepted Accounting Standards Topic ( ASC 105 ) of the FASB ASC. ASC 105 defines the FASB ASC as the single source of authoritative nongovernmental U.S. GAAP, superseding existing FASB, American Institute of Certified Public Accountants ( AICPA ), Emerging Issues Task Force ( EITF ), and related accounting literature. This standard reorganizes the thousands of GAAP pronouncements into roughly 90 accounting topics and displays them using a consistent structure; also included, is relevant Securities and Exchange Commission guidance organized using the same topical structure in separate sections. ASC 105 is effective for reporting periods ended after September 15, 2009. We adopted the provisions of ASC 105 beginning with our condensed consolidated financial statements for the quarter ended September 30, 2009, and our financial statements and related disclosures reflect the newly adopted codification. In August 2009, the FASB issued Accounting Standards Update ( ASU ) number 2009-05 ( ASU 2009-05 ), an update to the Fair Value Measurements and Disclosures Topic ( ASC 820 ). This update provides clarification that in circumstances in which a quoted price in an active market for the identical liability is not available, a reporting entity is required to measure fair value using (a) a valuation technique that uses the quoted price of the identical liability when traded as an asset or quoted prices for similar liabilities and/or (b) an income approach valuation technique or a market approach valuation technique, consistent with the principles of ASC 820. This update is effective for the first reporting period (including interim periods) beginning after issuance. We adopted this update beginning with our condensed consolidated financial statements for the quarter ended September 30, 2009; the adoption of this update did not have a material impact on our consolidated financial position or results of operations.
