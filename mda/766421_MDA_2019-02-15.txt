ITEM 7. MANAGEMENT S DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS OF FINANCIAL CONDITION AND RESULTS OF OPERATIONS OVERVIEW The following Management Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations (MD&A) is intended to help the reader understand our company, our operations and our present business environment. MD&A is provided as a supplement to and should be read in conjunction with our consolidated financial statements and the accompanying notes. All statements in the following discussion that are not statements of historical information or descriptions of current accounting policy are forward-looking statements. Please consider our forward-looking statements in light of the risks referred to in this report introductory cautionary note and the risks mentioned in Part I, Item 1A. Risk Factors. This overview summarizes the MD&A, which includes the following sections: Year in Review highlights from 2018 outlining some of the major events that happened during the year and how they affected our financial performance. Results of Operations an in-depth analysis of our revenues by segment and our expenses from a consolidated perspective for the three years presented in our consolidated financial statements. To the extent material to the understanding of segment profitability, we more fully describe the segment expenses per financial statement line item. Financial and statistical data is also included here. As discussed in Note 2, the adoption of two new accounting standards resulted in retroactive adjustments to our 2017 and 2016 financial information as reported. We have recast our financial information to reflect the impact of those standards. Additionally, as Virgin America was acquired on December 14, 2016, its financial and operational results are reflected in the year ended December 31, 2017, but not in the comparative prior period. However, for comparability purposes, we have added "Combined Comparative" information for 2016, which is more fully described below. This section includes forward-looking statements regarding our view of 2019 . Further information about the acquisition of Virgin America can be found in our previously filed Forms 10-K for 2016 and 2017. Liquidity and Capital Resources an overview of our financial position, analysis of cash flows, sources and uses of cash, contractual obligations and commitments and off-balance sheet arrangements. Critical Accounting Estimates a discussion of our accounting estimates that involve significant judgment and uncertainties. YEAR IN REVIEW December 2018 marked the two-year anniversary of our acquisition of Virgin America. As we look back over that time, we are very pleased with how far we have come. Just 24 months ago, we were two airlines in complementary geographies with distinct products, operating processes and cultures. We also had separate FAA certificates, labor agreements, and systems. As we stand today, virtually all of that has changed. Our operating processes are fully aligned, substantially all of our systems have been merged, and all but one of our labor groups are under single collective bargaining agreements. Through 2018, we have completed about 95% of our major integration milestones and we continue to make great progress on a number of fronts. Culturally, our employees are coming together as one team. Across the fleet, our guest experience is increasingly aligned, and we will reach full alignment early in 2020 as we complete the renovation of the Airbus fleet. We recently began to swap Boeing and Airbus aircraft onto the most appropriate routes. Our flight attendants began flying as integrated crews in January 2019, and we are working on the integration of our pilot schedules now. With much of the integration work behind us, we are shifting our focus to realizing the merger synergies and maturing our recent network expansions. Our core business remains strong and we continue to leverage the financial and operational discipline that has long been a source of our competitive advantage. In 2018, we announced or launched a host of new revenue initiatives, including increases to bag fees to better align with the industry, the introduction of Saver Fares, and the reconfiguration of Airbus aircraft. We continue to invest heavily in our brand and product, through projects like satellite connectivity for our full Mainline fleet, updating and expanding airport lounges, and introducing new food and beverage choices onboard. These investments, among others, are laying the ground work as we look to grow revenues and strengthen margins in 2019 and beyond. 31 In 2018 , we posted our 15th consecutive annual profit on an adjusted basis. Our pretax income was $585 million , compared to $1.2 billion in 2017. Our 2018 pretax income on an adjusted basis (a non-GAAP financial measure) was $739 million , a decrease of 42% from 2017 . Adjusted pretax income for 2018 excludes $87 million of merger-related costs associated with our acquisition of Virgin America, $45 million of other one-time special charges, and $22 million of mark-to-market fuel hedge adjustments. The decrease in adjusted pretax income was driven largely by an increase in operating expenses, excluding fuel and special items, of $430 million , and an increase in fuel expense of $489 million due to significantly higher fuel prices. The increased costs were partially offset by an improvement in operating revenues of $370 million . Revenue growth of $370 million was driven by continued network expansion and aircraft added to our fleet since prior year, allowing us to grow capacity about 5% . The regional business grew more quickly as we took delivery of 25 new E175 regional jets and grew capacity by 20% . As we look to 2019, we are slowing our capacity growth to 2% as we focus on strengthening our performance across the network and expanding margins. See Results of Operations below for further discussion of changes in revenues and operating expenses and our reconciliation of non-GAAP measures to the most directly comparable GAAP measure. 2018 Accomplishments and Highlights Recognition and Awards - Alaska Ranked "Highest in Customer Satisfaction Among Traditional Carriers" in 2018 by J.D.

Donated over $17 million and contributed more than 44,000 volunteer hours to support nonprofits in our local communities, focusing on youth and education, medical (research/transportation) and community outreach. 32 Shareholder Return In 2018 , we paid cash dividends of $158 million and repurchased 776,186 shares of our common stock for $50 million under the $1 billion share repurchase program authorized by our Board of Directors in August 2015 . As of December 31, 2018 , the Company has repurchased approximately 6 million shares for $438 million under this program. Since 2007, we have repurchased 61 million shares of common stock for $1.6 billion for an average price of approximately $27.20 per share. In 2018 , we increased our quarterly dividend 7% from $0.30 per share to $0.32 per share, and, subsequent to December 31, 2018 , we announced a 9% increase to $0.35 per share for 2019 . Overall, we returned $208 million to shareholders during 2018 . We expect to continue to return capital to shareholders in 2019 , primarily in the form of dividends. Labor Update In July 2018, Alaska dispatchers, represented by TWU, ratified a merger transition agreement. And, in the third quarter, our pilots finalized their integrated seniority list. As a result, all Mainline groups except for aircraft technicians, are now under a single collective bargaining agreement and have an integrated seniority list. Additionally, we are currently in negotiations with IAM, who represent our clerical, office and passenger service employees as well as our ramp and stores agents. We are optimistic that we will reach a long-term agreement with this work group early in 2019 . Other In April, we entered into an agreement to lease 12 airport slots at LaGuardia Airport (LGA) and eight airport slots at Reagan National Airport (DCA) to another carrier. The lease began in October 2018 and continues through 2028. This agreement enables us to monetize these valuable slots, and reallocate flying from Dallas Love Field (DAL) to more strategic and profitable opportunities on the West Coast. We maintain the right to resume flying using these slots, should we choose to do so, in 2028 when the agreement expires, or if perimeter restrictions change. On August 10, 2018, one of our Q400 aircraft was taken without authorization by an employee from Sea-Tac International Airport. The aircraft crashed in a remote area south of the airport, resulting in the loss of life of the individual flying the aircraft. There were no other fatalities and no ground structures were involved at the crash site. The loss of the aircraft is a fully insured event with no deductibles. Air Group's aviation insurance program is secured with a number of highly rated insurers on quota share programs. Presenting a claim to all insurers on the programs commenced only after the aircraft wreckage was released from governmental authorities in late September 2018. The FBI concluded their investigation in November 2018. We are currently working with insurers to finalize our claim and expect to receive proceeds in the first half of 2019. Outlook In 2019 and beyond, we are focused on completing our integration of Boeing and Airbus operations and realizing the full synergies from the merger. We are investing in our people through an all-employee workshop called Flight Path so that we can have face-to-face conversations between leaders and our employees and come together as one team. We know our people are our greatest competitive advantage and that investment, along with investments in our product, will allow us to continue to be recognized in the industry as one of the best in customer satisfaction. In 2019 , some of the more notable guest experience enhancement projects underway include adding high-speed satellite connectivity to our entire Boeing and Airbus fleets, further upgrades to our onboard menu offerings, updating and expanding airport lounges, and working with the Port of Seattle to open a state-of-the-art 20-gate North Satellite Concourse at Sea-Tac Airport. We also have begun the retrofit of our Airbus fleet, which will allow us to align the product across both Mainline aircraft platforms. We have also announced new revenue initiatives that are competitively driven and incremental to our expected merger synergies. In Fall 2018 we introduced a new option for our guests called the "Saver Fare," a low-fare product which we believe will result in incremental annual revenue of approximately $100 million in 2019. In addition, we have implemented a series of other revenue initiatives that we expect to add $50 million of revenue in 2019, such as offering exit rows for sale, introducing demand-based pricing for our premium class seats, leveraging new technology to better manage revenue post-sale, and eliminating fee waivers for changes made outside of 60 days. Furthermore, we announced an increase in our checked bag fees which is also expected to add approximately $50 million of incremental revenue in 2019, bringing the expected total of new revenue initiatives to $200 million. We believe these changes provide guests with more options and reflect the significant increase in the value of our expanded network and product. 33 In 2019, we will slow our capacity growth and renew our focus on expanding margins. Despite cost pressure from wage increases across our unionized labor groups and higher maintenance expenses, we will manage costs through productivity initiatives, schedule optimization and other initiatives. We expect to incur further costs associated with the ongoing integration of Virgin America, though less than in prior years. We also expect the price per gallon of jet fuel to decrease approximately 4% from the prior-year period. Our CASMex will be disproportionately impacted in the first quarter and first half of 2019 due to an increased mix of Regional flying, timing of heavy maintenance events, and costs for all-employee training. On a full year basis, however, we expect to see total unit costs excluding fuel to decrease in the second half of 2019, and expect a full year CASMex increase of 2% to 2.5% . We expect to grow our combined network capacity in 2019 by approximately 2% , compared to 5.3% growth in 2018 . Current schedules indicate competitive capacity will increase by roughly 4 points in the first quarter of 2019 compared to the first quarter of 2018. We believe that our product, our operation, our engaged employees, our award-winning service, and our competitive Mileage Plan , combined with our strong balance sheet, give us the ability to compete successfully in the markets we serve. RESULTS OF OPERATIONS ADJUSTED (NON-GAAP) RESULTS AND PER-SHARE AMOUNTS We believe disclosure of earnings excluding the impact of merger-related costs, mark-to-market gains or losses or other individual special revenues or expenses is useful information to investors because: By excluding fuel expense and certain special items (including merger-related and other costs) from our unit metrics, we believe that we have better visibility into the results of operations and our non-fuel cost initiatives. Our industry is highly competitive and is characterized by high fixed costs, so even a small reduction in non-fuel operating costs can lead to a significant improvement in operating results. In addition, we believe that all domestic carriers are similarly impacted by changes in jet fuel costs over the long run, so it is important for management (and investors) to understand the impact of (and trends in) company-specific cost drivers, such as labor rates and productivity, airport costs, maintenance costs, etc., which are more controllable by management. Cost per ASM (CASM) excluding fuel and certain special items, such as merger-related costs, is one of the most important measures used by management and by the Air Group Board of Directors in assessing quarterly and annual cost performance. Adjusted income before income tax and CASM excluding fuel (and other items as specified in our plan documents) are important metrics for the employee incentive plan, which covers the majority of Air Group employees. CASM excluding fuel and certain special items is a measure commonly used by industry analysts and we believe it is an important metric by which they compare our airlines to others in the industry. The measure is also the subject of frequent questions from investors. Disclosure of the individual impact of certain noted items provides investors the ability to measure and monitor performance both with and without these special items. We believe that disclosing the impact of certain items, such as merger-related costs and mark-to-market hedging adjustments, is important because it provides information on significant items that are not necessarily indicative of future performance. Industry analysts and investors consistently measure our performance without these items for better comparability between periods and among other airlines. Although we disclose our passenger unit revenues, we do not (nor are we able to) evaluate unit revenues excluding the impact that changes in fuel costs have had on ticket prices. Fuel expense represents a large percentage of our total operating expenses. Fluctuations in fuel prices often drive changes in unit revenues in the mid-to-long term. Although we believe it is useful to evaluate non-fuel unit costs for the reasons noted above, we would caution readers of these financial statements not to place undue reliance on unit costs excluding fuel as a measure or predictor of future profitability because of the significant impact of fuel costs on our business. Although we are presenting these non-GAAP amounts for the reasons above, investors and other readers should not necessarily conclude that these amounts are non-recurring, infrequent, or unusual in nature. 34 ADOPTION OF NEW ACCOUNTING STANDARDS We adopted the new revenue recognition and retirement benefit accounting standards on January 1, 2018, utilizing a full retrospective transition method. Accordingly, information for 2017 and 2016 in the following comparative discussions have been recast to reflect the new standards. 2018 COMPARED WITH 2017 Our consolidated net income for 2018 was $437 million , or $3.52 per diluted share, compared to net income of $960 million , or $7.75 per diluted share, in 2017 . Excluding the impact of merger-related costs, mark-to-market fuel hedge adjustments, a contract termination fee, and one-time bonuses paid to employees as a result of tax reform, our adjusted consolidated net income for 2018 was $554 million , or $4.46 per diluted share, compared to an adjusted consolidated net income of $791 million , or $6.38 per share, in 2017 . The following table reconciles our adjusted net income and earnings per diluted share (EPS) during the full year 2018 and 2017 to amounts as reported in accordance with GAAP. Twelve Months Ended December 31, 2018 2017 (in millions, except per-share amounts) Dollars Diluted EPS Dollars Diluted EPS Reported GAAP net income and diluted EPS $ 437 $ 3.52 $ 960 $ 7.75 Mark-to-market fuel hedge (benefit)/expense 22 0.18 (7 ) (0.06 ) Special items merger-related costs (a) 87 0.70 116 0.94 Special items - other (a) 45 0.36 Income tax effect on special items and fuel hedge adjustments (37 ) (0.30 ) (41 ) (0.33 ) Special tax (benefit)/expense (b) (237 ) (1.92 ) Non-GAAP adjusted net income and diluted EPS $ 554 $ 4.46 $ 791 $ 6.38 (a) Refer to Note 11 to the consolidated financial statement for the description of special items. (b) Special tax (benefit)/expense in 2017 is due to the remeasurement of deferred tax liabilities as a result of the Tax Cuts and Jobs Act signed into law on December 22, 2017, offset by certain state tax law enactments.

Below are operating statistics we use to measure performance. As the acquisition of Virgin America closed on December 14, 2016, Consolidated and Mainline amounts presented below include Virgin America results for the period December 14, 2016 through December 31, 2016 in the twelve months ended December 31, 2016. Additionally, certain historical information has been adjusted to reflect the adoption of new accounting standards. We often refer to unit revenues and adjusted unit costs, which are non-GAAP measures.

The changes are summarized in the following table: Twelve Months Ended December 31, (in millions) 2018 2017 % Change Passenger revenue $ 7,632 $ 7,301 4.5 % Mileage Plan other revenue 434 418 3.8 % Cargo and other 198 175 13.1 % Total operating revenues $ 8,264 $ 7,894 4.7 % Passenger Revenue On a consolidated basis, passenger revenue for 2018 increased by $331 million , or 5% , on a 5% increase in capacity, partially offset by a 0.6 pt decrease in load factor. The capacity increase was driven by the expansion of our network and fleet over the past year, although growth was lower than in 2017 as we slowed our expansion to allow for the maturation of a significant number of markets added after our acquisition of Virgin America. Lower load factor is a result of our growth and an increase in competitive capacity in markets we serve. In 2018, we began the first of a number of initiatives to combat competitive pressures, including increasing our bag fees, reconfiguring our Airbus cabins, and the introduction of our "Saver Fare" in the fourth quarter. Mileage Plan other revenue On a consolidated basis, Mileage Plan other revenue increased $16 million , or 4% , as compared to 2017 , primarily due to growth in our affinity credit card program resulting in an increase in miles sold to our affinity credit card partner. Cargo and Other Revenue On a consolidated basis, Cargo and other revenue increased $23 million , or 13% , from 2017 . The increase is primarily attributable to increased freight and mail capacity from our three freighters and utilizing our Airbus fleet to transport cargo. The remainder of the increase was due to increased lounge revenue as a result of our new lounges at JFK and Sea-Tac Airports. OPERATING EXPENSES Total operating expenses increased $935 million , or 14% , compared to 2017 . We consider it is useful to summarize operating expenses as follows, which is consistent with the way expenses are reported internally and evaluated by management: Twelve Months Ended December 31, (in millions) 2018 2017 % Change Fuel expense $ 1,936 $ 1,447 33.8 % Non-fuel expenses 5,553 5,123 8.4 % Special items - merger-related costs 87 116 (25.0 )% Special items - other 45 NM Total Operating Expenses $ 7,621 $ 6,686 14.0 % Significant operating expense variances from 2017 are more fully described below. Aircraft Fuel Aircraft fuel expense includes both raw fuel expense (as defined below) and the effect of mark-to-market adjustments to our fuel hedge portfolio included in our consolidated statement of operations as the value of that portfolio increases and decreases. Aircraft fuel expense can be volatile, even between quarters, because it includes these gains or losses in the value of the underlying instrument as crude oil prices and refining margins increase or decrease. 37 Raw fuel expense is defined as the price that we generally pay at the airport, or the into-plane price, including taxes and fees. Raw fuel prices are impacted by world oil prices and refining costs, which can vary by region in the U.S. Raw fuel expense approximates cash paid to suppliers and does not reflect the effect of our fuel hedges. Aircraft fuel expense increased $489 million , or 34% , compared to 2017 . The elements of the change are illustrated in the following table: Twelve Months Ended December 31, 2018 2017 (in millions, except for per gallon amounts) Dollars Cost/Gal Dollars Cost/Gal Raw or "into-plane" fuel cost $ 1,938 $ 2.31 $ 1,437 $ 1.80 (Gain)/loss on settled hedges (24 ) (0.03 ) 17 0.02 Consolidated economic fuel expense $ 1,914 $ 2.28 $ 1,454 $ 1.82 Mark-to-market fuel hedge adjustments 22 0.03 (7 ) GAAP fuel expense $ 1,936 $ 2.31 $ 1,447 $ 1.82 Fuel gallons 839 797 Raw fuel expense per gallon increased 28% due to higher West Coast jet fuel prices. West Coast jet fuel prices are impacted by both the price of crude oil, as well as the refining costs associated with the conversion of crude oil to jet fuel. The increase in raw fuel price per gallon during 2018 was driven by a 32% increase in refining margins and a 28% increase in crude oil prices, compared to the prior year. Fuel gallons consumed increased by 42 million , or 5% , consistent with the increase in capacity of 5% . We also evaluate economic fuel expense, which we define as raw fuel expense adjusted for the cash we receive from hedge counterparties for hedges that settle during the period, and for the premium expense that we paid for those contracts. A key difference between aircraft fuel expense and economic fuel expense is the timing of gain or loss recognition on our hedge portfolio. When we refer to economic fuel expense, we include gains and losses only when they are realized for those contracts that were settled during the period based on their original contract terms. We believe this is the best measure of the effect that fuel prices have on our business because it most closely approximates the net cash outflow associated with purchasing fuel for our operations. Accordingly, many industry analysts evaluate our results using this measure, and it is the basis for most internal management reporting and incentive pay plans. Gains recognized for hedges that settled during the year were $24 million in 2018 , compared to losses of $17 million in 2017 . These amounts represent cash paid for premium expense, offset by any cash received from those hedges at settlement. As of the date of this filing, we expect our economic fuel price per gallon to decrease approximately 4% in the first quarter of 2019 , as compared to the first quarter of 2018 due to decreasing crude oil prices. As both oil prices and refining margins are volatile, we are unable to forecast the full-year cost with any certainty. Wages and Benefits Wages and benefits increased during 2018 by $259 million , or 13% , compared to 2017 . The primary components of wages and benefits are shown in the following table: Twelve Months Ended December 31, (in millions) 2018 2017 % Change Wages $ 1,658 $ 1,468 12.9 % Pension Defined benefit plans 48 39 23.1 % Defined contribution plans 126 103 22.3 % Medical and other benefits 245 216 13.4 % Payroll taxes 113 105 7.6 % Total wages and benefits $ 2,190 $ 1,931 13.4 % Wages increased $190 million with a 7.2% increase in FTEs. The increase in FTEs is attributable to the growth in our business and the growth in McGee Air Services, which has brought certain airport ground service positions in-house that were 38 previously reflected in Contracted Services expense. Additionally, the increase in wages is driven by higher wage rates for many work groups, including on average a 24% increase for our Mainline pilots and a 10% increase for our Mainline flight attendants, whose new contract rates became effective in the fourth quarter of 2017 and the first quarter of 2018 , respectively. Costs associated with our defined contribution plans increased $23 million , or 22% , due to FTE growth, increased participation throughout all labor groups and higher contribution rates for Mainline pilots and flight attendants as a result of new contract rates effective in the fourth quarter of 2017 and first quarter of 2018, respectively. Medical and other benefits expense increased $29 million , or 13% , primarily due to FTE growth and rising medical costs. We expect wages and benefits expense to be higher in 2019 compared to 2018 on an approximate 2% - 3% increase in FTEs. Our guidance does not include the impact of any future agreements we may reach with aircraft technicians or the IAM labor group. Variable Incentive Pay Variable incentive pay expense increased to $147 million in 2018 from $135 million in 2017 due to a higher wage base upon which achievement percentage is applied as compared to the prior year, as well as a higher number of months where we achieved our monthly OPR goals. Aircraft Maintenance Aircraft maintenance costs increased by $44 million , or 11% , compared to 2017 . Maintenance costs increased primarily due to a power-by-the-hour engine maintenance arrangement on our B737-800 aircraft which was entered into, and became effective, in the fourth quarter of 2017. Although the agreement results in increased expense earlier in the engine life cycle of B737-800 aircraft, it allows for much more predictable expense patterns over the fleet life. The remaining increase was due to higher volumes of scheduled and unscheduled maintenance events as compared to the prior period. We expect aircraft maintenance expense to increase 2% - 4% in 2019 due to increased volume of maintenance checks and airframe and engine component costs in 2019 as compared to 2018, due to our larger fleet. We expect these costs to be higher in the first half of 2019, and then to decline as we proceed through the year. Aircraft Rent Aircraft rent expense increased $41 million , or 15% , compared to 2017 , primarily due to the the addition of four A321neos to our Mainline fleet and nine E175s added to our CPA agreement with SkyWest in 2018. We expect aircraft rent to increase in 2019 at a greater rate than our forecasted capacity growth due to the full year impact of these aircraft, as well as two additional A321neo deliveries in 2019. Landing Fees and Other Rentals Landing fees and other rental expenses increased $39 million , or 8% , compared to 2017 , primarily driven by our 5% increase in capacity and rate increases at many of our hub airports. We expect landing fees and other rental expense to grow 7% to 10% in 2019 as we continue to add capacity to our network. We also expect to see rate increases at many airports we serve, specifically our hubs, as significant capital programs are undertaken. Selling Expenses Selling expenses decreased by $42 million , or 11% , compared to 2017 . This decrease was primarily due to lower credit card commissions and decreased promotional and advertising activities, notably those related to Virgin America. We expect selling expense to decrease in 2019 , due primarily to a continued improvement in our credit card rates, decreased spending on advertising and distribution, as well as aggressive targets set to reduce our vendor costs. 39 Depreciation and Amortization Depreciation and amortization expenses increased by $26 million , or 7% , compared to 2017 , primarily due to the addition of eight owned B737-900ERs and 16 owned E175s to our fleet since December 31, 2017 , as well as the acceleration of depreciation taken on certain of our Q400 aircraft. We expect depreciation and amortization expense to increase 9% - 13% in 2019 , primarily due to the full year impact of depreciation of our E175 aircraft delivered in 2018 and additional deliveries in 2019, as well as accelerated depreciation on our Q400 fleet as we begin to retire a portion of this fleet. Food and Beverage Service Food and beverage service expense increased by $16 million , or 8% , compared to 2017 , due to the increased number of passengers, premium class offerings and enhancements to our onboard menu offerings to provide higher quality food and beverage products. We expect food and beverage expenses to remain flat in 2019 compared to 2018 , primarily due to our increasing focus on reducing waste and changes to our catering process for our regional business. Third-party Regional Carrier Expense Third-party regional carrier expense, which represents payments made to SkyWest and PenAir under our CPA agreements, increased $33 million , or 27% , in 2018 compared to 2017 . The increase is primarily due to the addition of nine E175 aircraft operated by SkyWest in the current year. We expect third-party regional carrier expense to continue to increase in 2019 as we realize the full-year impact of the additional E175 aircraft operated by SkyWest. Special Items - Merger-Related Costs We recorded $87 million of merger-related costs in 2018 associated with our ongoing integration of Virgin America operations, compared to $116 million in 2017 . Costs incurred in 2018 consisted primarily of severance and retention costs, IT integration costs, and the write-off of Virgin America related assets connected with our transition to a single PSS in April 2018. We expect to continue to incur merger-related costs in 2019. Special Items - Other We recorded other special items of $45 million in 2018. These consisted of a one-time settlement fee of $20 million for the termination of a former maintenance services agreement which was subsequently replaced by a new agreement that provides more flexibility for the timing and scope of aircraft engine maintenance. The remaining $25 million was due to one-time bonuses paid to employees as a result of tax reform in early 2018. Consolidated Nonoperating Income (Expense) During 2018 we recorded nonoperating expense of $58 million , compared to nonoperating expense of $49 million in 2017 . The increase is primarily due to certain disposal costs associated with nonoperating CRJ-700 aircraft. ADDITIONAL SEGMENT INFORMATION Refer to Note 13 of the consolidated financial statements for a detailed description of each segment. Below is a summary of each segment's profitability. Mainline Mainline adjusted pretax profit was $809 million in 2018 compared to $1.2 billion in 2017 . The $435 million decrease in pretax profit was primarily driven by a $306 million increase in Mainline non-fuel operating expenses and a $370 million increase in Mainline fuel expense. These increases were partially offset by a $231 million increase in Mainline operating revenue. 40 Non-fuel operating expense increased due to higher wages related to new contract wage rates for pilots and flight attendants, and higher other operating expense categories as described above. Higher raw fuel prices and an increase in gallons consumed drove the increase in Mainline fuel expense. Mainline revenue increased primarily due to increased revenue passengers on lower average fares. Regional Our Regional operations incurred a pretax loss of $100 million in 2018 compared to a pretax profit of $34 million in 2017 . The pretax loss was primarily attributable to $172 million higher non-fuel operating expense and $90 million increase in fuel costs, partially offset by a $139 million increase in operating revenues. The increase in non-fuel operating expenses is primarily due to higher ownership costs associated with nine E175 aircraft operated by SkyWest that were added to the regional fleet over the past year, as well as higher CPA rates on a 20% increase in capacity. Horizon Horizon achieved a pretax profit of $27 million in 2018 compared to pretax loss of $8 million in 2017 . The change was primarily driven by a significantly improved operation in 2018 as compared to 2017, a $17 million decrease in aircraft maintenance expense due to a lower volume of scheduled maintenance events as compared to the prior period, and a 11% increase growth in capacity attributable to 16 E175 aircraft added to Horizon's fleet over the past year. 41 2017 COMPARED WITH 2016 Our consolidated net income for 2017 was $960 million , or $7.75 per diluted share, compared to net income of $797 million , or $6.41 per diluted share, in 2016 . Our financial results include results of Virgin America for the period from December 14, 2016 through December 31, 2016 and the impact of purchase accounting as of December 14, 2016. Refer to our previously filed Forms 10-K for 2016 and 2017 for additional information on accounting for our merger with Virgin America. Excluding the impact of mark-to-market fuel hedge adjustments and special items, our adjusted consolidated net income for 2017 was $791 million , or $6.38 per diluted share, compared to an adjusted consolidated net income of $894 million , or $7.19 per share, in 2016 . The following tables reconcile our adjusted net income and EPS during the full year 2017 and 2016 to amounts as reported in accordance with GAAP.

COMBINED COMPARATIVE OPERATING STATISTICS Given the December 2016 acquisition of Virgin America, we believe that analysis of specific financial and operational results on a combined basis provides more meaningful year-over-year comparisons. The discussion below includes Combined Comparative results for 2016, determined as the sum of the historical consolidated results of Air Group and Virgin America. Additionally, we adopted the new Revenue Recognition and Retirement Benefit accounting standards on January 1, 2018 utilizing a full retrospective transition method. Pre-acquisition Virgin America 2016 results have not been retrospectively adjusted for these accounting standards, nor has it been conformed to reflect Air Group's historical financial statement presentation. The Combined Comparative information does not purport to reflect what our financial and operational results would have been had the acquisition been consummated at the beginning of the periods presented. 42 Twelve Months Ended December 31, Air Group Virgin America Combined Combined 2017 (b) 2016 (b) 2016 (c) 2016 (a) Change Consolidated: Revenue passengers (in 000) 44,005 34,289 7,658 41,947 4.9% RPMs (in 000,000) 52,338 37,209 11,545 48,754 7.4% ASMs (in 000,000) 62,072 44,135 13,818 57,953 7.1% Load Factor 84.3% 84.3% (a) 84.1% 0.2 pts RASM (b) 12.72 13.43 (a) 12.92 (1.5)% CASMex (b) 8.25 8.32 (a) 8.11 1.7% FTEs 20,183 14,760 2,618 17,378 16.1% Mainline: RPMs (in 000,000) 48,236 33,489 11,545 45,034 7.1% ASMs (in 000,000) 56,945 39,473 13,818 53,291 6.9% Load Factor 84.7% 84.8% (a) 84.5% 0.2 pts RASM (b) 12.00 15.01 (a) 14.05 (15.0)% (a) 2016 Combined operating statistics have been recalculated using the combined results.

Information has not been adjusted to reflect new accounting standards. OPERATING REVENUES Total operating revenues increased $2.0 billion , or 33% , during 2017 compared to the same period in 2016 . On a Combined Comparative basis, total operating revenues increased $405 million or 5% . The changes, including the reconciliation of the impact of Virgin America on the comparative results, are summarized in the following table: Twelve Months Ended December 31, Change Air Group Virgin America Combined Combined (in millions) 2017 (b) 2016 (b) 2016 (c) 2016 (a) $ % Passenger revenue $ 7,301 $ 5,392 $ 1,414 $ 6,806 $ 495 7.3 % Mileage Plan other revenue 418 370 370 48 13.0 % Cargo and other 175 163 150 313 (138 ) (44.1 )% Total operating revenues $ 7,894 $ 5,925 $ 1,564 $ 7,489 $ 405 5.4 % (a), (b), (c) See footnotes on the Combined Comparative Operating Statistics table above. Passenger Revenue On a consolidated basis, passenger revenue for 2017 increased by $1.9 billion , or 35% on a 41% increase in capacity driven by the acquisition of Virgin America, offset by a 3.7% decline in yield. On a Combined Comparative basis, Passenger revenue increased by $495 million or 7% , due to a 7% increase in capacity. The increase in capacity was driven by our continued network expansion and growth in the number of operating aircraft. In 2017, we launched 44 new markets to activate our new, larger network. Lower ticket yields (pricing) were impacted, in large part, by our new market growth and by competitor pricing actions felt more acutely in our California markets. Mileage Plan other revenue Mileage Plan other revenue increased by $48 million , or 13% , compared to 2016 , primarily due to increases in miles sold to our affinity card partner during the year and Mileage Plan revenue earned from partner airlines. 43 Cargo and other Cargo and other revenue increased $12 million , or 7% , from 2016 , due to increased lounge revenues and freight services. On a Combined Comparative basis, Cargo and other revenue decreased $138 million or 44.1% . This decrease is primarily due to not reflecting the impact of the new revenue accounting standard on 2016 Pre-Acquisition Virgin America totals. Had the standard been applied, the majority of Virgin America's other revenue would have been moved to Passenger or Mileage Plan other revenue. OPERATING EXPENSES Total operating expenses increased $2.1 billion , or 45% , compared to 2016 . On a Combined Comparative basis, total operating expenses increased $725 million , or 12% , primarily as a result of higher wages and benefits and higher fuel costs, among other increases. We believe it is useful to summarize operating expenses as follows, which is consistent with the way expenses are reported internally and evaluated by management: Twelve Months Ended December 31, Change Air Group Virgin America Combined Combined (in millions) 2017 (b) 2016 (b) 2016 (c) 2016 (a) $ % Fuel expense $ 1,447 $ 831 $ 293 $ 1,124 $ 323 28.7 % Non-fuel expenses 5,123 3,671 1,028 4,699 424 9.0 % Special items 116 117 21 138 (22 ) (15.9 )% Total Operating Expenses $ 6,686 $ 4,619 $ 1,342 $ 5,961 $ 725 12 % (a), (b), (c) See footnotes on the Combined Comparative Operating Statistics table above. Significant operating expense variances from 2016 are more fully described below. Aircraft Fuel Aircraft fuel expense increased $616 million , or 74% , compared to 2016 . On a Combined Comparative basis, aircraft fuel expense increased $323 million , or 29% . The elements of the change are summarized in the following table: Twelve Months Ended December 31, 2017 2016 as Reported 2016 Combined (in millions, except for per gallon amounts) Dollars Cost/Gal Dollars Cost/Gal Raw or "into-plane" fuel cost $ 1,437 $ 1.80 $ 828 $ 1.49 $ 1,105 $ 1.49 Losses on settled hedges 17 0.02 16 0.03 34 0.05 Consolidated economic fuel expense $ 1,454 $ 1.82 $ 844 $ 1.52 $ 1,139 $ 1.54 Mark-to-mark fuel hedge adjustments (7 ) (13 ) (0.02 ) (15 ) (0.02 ) GAAP fuel expense $ 1,447 $ 1.82 $ 831 $ 1.50 $ 1,124 $ 1.52 Fuel gallons 797 554 739 On a Combined Comparative basis, raw fuel expense per gallon increased 21% due primarily to higher West Coast jet fuel prices. West Coast jet fuel prices are impacted by both the price of crude oil, as well as the refining margins associated with the conversion of crude oil to jet fuel. The increase in raw fuel price per gallon during 2017 was driven by a 38% increase in refining margins and a 17% increase in crude oil prices, compared to the prior year. Fuel gallons consumed increased by 58 million, or 8%, consistent with the increase in capacity of 7% on a Combined Comparative basis. Losses recognized for hedges that settled during the year were $17 million in 2017 , compared to losses of $16 million in 2016 . These amounts represent cash paid for premium expense, offset by any cash received from those hedges at settlement. 44 Non-fuel Expense and Non-special items The table below provides the reconciliation of the impact of Virgin America on the comparative results for each of our operating expense line items, excluding fuel and special items.

Wages and Benefits Wages and benefits increased during 2017 by $537 million , or 39% , compared to 2016 . On a Combined Comparative basis, total wages and benefits increased by $253 million or 15% . The primary components of wages and benefits, including a reconciliation of 2016 on a Combined Comparative basis, are shown in the following table: Twelve Months Ended December 31, Change Air Group Virgin America Combined Combined (in millions) 2017 (b) 2016 (b) 2016 (c) 2016 (a) $ % Wages $ 1,468 $ 1,022 $ 224 $ 1,246 $ 222 18 % Medical and other benefits 216 192 23 215 1 % Defined contribution plans 103 67 22 89 14 16 % Pension defined benefit plans 39 37 37 2 5 % Payroll taxes 105 76 15 91 14 15 % Total wages and benefits $ 1,931 $ 1,394 $ 284 $ 1,678 $ 253 15 % (a), (b), (c) See footnotes on the Combined Comparative Operating Statistics table above. On a Combined Comparative basis, wages increased $222 million with a 16% increase in FTEs. The increase in FTEs is attributable to the growth in our business and the growth in McGee Air Services, which has brought certain airport ground service positions in-house that were previously reflected in Contracted Services expense. Additionally, wage rates for pilots at Alaska and Virgin America increased significantly in November 2017 as a result of new contract rates stemming from a decision reached by a third-party arbitration panel during the fourth quarter of 2017 . Costs associated with our defined contribution plans increased $14 million , or 16% , on a Combined Comparative basis, due to FTE growth and increased participation throughout all labor groups. Additionally, due to the arbitration decision reached in the fourth quarter of 2017, pilots at Alaska and Virgin America began receiving contributions at a higher rate. 45 Variable Incentive Pay Variable incentive pay expense increased to $135 million in 2017 from $127 million in 2016 . On a Combined Comparative basis, variable incentive pay decreased $24 million, or 15%, due to lower achievement against performance-based pay metrics as compared to the prior year. Aircraft Maintenance Aircraft maintenance costs increased by $121 million , or 45% , compared to 2016 . On a Combined Comparative basis, aircraft maintenance costs increased $41 million , or 12% . Maintenance costs increased primarily due to timing of scheduled maintenance events in 2017, as well as a power-by-the-hour maintenance agreement for our B737-800 aricraft that began during the fourth quarter of 2017. Aircraft Rent Aircraft rent expense increased $160 million , or 140% , compared to 2016 . On a Combined Comparative basis, aircraft rent expense decreased $10 million , or 4% , primarily due to the resetting of straight-line aircraft rent resulting from purchase price accounting for leases held by Virgin America. Landing Fees and Other Rentals Landing fees and other rental expenses increased $140 million , or 44% , compared to 2016. On a Combined Comparative basis, landing fees and other rental expenses increased $33 million, or 8%, primarily due to increased flying in 2017 as we increased capacity by 7% and entered into 44 new markets. Contracted Services Contracted services increased $67 million , or 27% , when compared to 2016 . On a Combined Comparative basis, contracted services increased $7 million , or 2% , primarily due to increased flying at stations where we use vendors to assist us. Additionally, wage rates for our vendor employees have increased due to higher minimum wage laws in many locations we serve. These cost increases were partially offset by insourcing some of the ground services at many airports to McGee Air Services, whose costs are now included in other financial statement line items, particularly wages and benefits. Selling Expenses Selling expenses increased by $120 million , or 48% , compared to 2016 . On a Combined Comparative basis, selling expenses decreased $3 million , or 1% . The 2016 Pre-Acquisition Virgin America balances were not adjusted to reflect the new revenue recognition standard. Had the standard been applied, Virgin America's selling expenses would have decreased in 2016, resulting in a Combined Comparative year over year increase in selling expenses, mostly due to increased promotional and advertising activities. Depreciation and Amortization Depreciation and amortization expenses increased by $9 million , or 2% , compared to 2016 . On a Combined Comparative basis, depreciation and amortization expense decreased $28 million , or 7% , primarily due to a change in the estimated useful lives of certain B737 operating aircraft and related parts from 20 years to 25 years, which was effective October 1, 2016, partially offset by the addition of 14 B737-900ERs and 10 E175s to our fleet during 2017. Food and Beverage Service Food and beverage service expenses increased by $69 million , or 55% , compared to 2016. On a Combined Comparative basis, food and beverage service expenses increased $20 million , or 11% , due to the increased number of passengers, premium class offerings and enhancements to our onboard menu offerings to provide higher quality food and beverage products. Third-Party Regional Carrier Expense Third-party regional carrier expense, which represents payments made to SkyWest and PenAir under our CPAs, increased $26 million , or 27% , in 2017 compared to 2016 . The increase was primarily due to the addition of eight E175 aircraft operated by SkyWest in 2017. 46 Other Operating Expenses Other operating expenses increased $195 million , or 53% , compared to 2016 . On a Combined Comparative basis, other operating expenses increased $109 million , or 24% , primarily due to higher costs associated with crew costs such as hotels and per diems, training, higher IT costs, an increase in scrapped parts inventory, and higher property taxes. Special Items Merger-Related Costs We recorded special items of $116 million for merger-related costs associated with our acquisition of Virgin America in 2017 , compared to $117 million in 2016 , which reflects the results of Virgin America from December 14, 2016 through December 31, 2016, and $138 million on a Combined Comparative basis in 2016 . Costs incurred in 2017 consisted primarily of severance and retention costs, and IT integration costs. Consolidated Nonoperating Income (Expense) During 2017 , we recorded nonoperating expense of $49 million , compared to nonoperating income of $10 million in 2016 . On a Combined Comparative basis, nonoperating expense increased by $40 million , primarily due to interest expense incurred in 2017 on the debt issued in 2016 to finance the acquisition of Virgin America. ADDITIONAL SEGMENT INFORMATION Refer to Note 13 of the consolidated financial statements for a detailed description of each segment. Below is a summary of each segments' profitability. Mainline Mainline adjusted pretax profit was $1.2 billion in 2017 compared to $1.3 billion in 2016. On a Combined Comparative basis, Mainline adjusted pretax profit decreased by $267 million . The table below provides the reconciliation of the impact of Virgin America on the comparative results for our Mainline segment, excluding merger-related costs and mark-to-market fuel-hedge accounting charges: Twelve Months Ended December 31, Change Air Group Virgin America Combined Combined (in millions) 2017 (b) 2016 (b) 2016 (c) 2016 (a) $ Mainline Operating revenues $ 6,832 $ 4,908 $ 1,564 $ 6,472 $ 360 Non-fuel, non-special operating expenses 4,271 2,919 1,028 3,947 324 Economic fuel 1,282 719 293 1,012 270 Operating income 1,279 1,270 243 1,513 (234 ) Nonoperating income (expense) (35 ) 17 (19 ) (2 ) (33 ) Pretax profit $ 1,244 $ 1,287 $ 224 $ 1,511 $ (267 ) (a), (b), (c) See footnotes on the Combined Comparative Operating Statistics table above. The $267 million decrease in Combined Comparative pretax profit was driven by a $270 million increase in Mainline fuel expense, a $324 million increase in Mainline non-fuel operating expenses, and a $33 million increase in nonoperating expense. These increases were partially offset by a $360 million increase in Mainline passenger revenue. Higher raw fuel prices and an increase in gallons consumed to support additional flying, drove the increase in Mainline fuel expense. Non-fuel operating expenses increased due to higher wages to support our growth, and higher operating expenses as described above. Nonoperating expense increased primarily due to increased interest expense. Mainline revenue increased due to higher capacity from new routes. Regional Our Regional operations contributed a pretax profit of $34 million in 2017 compared to $124 million in 2016 . The $90 million decrease in pretax profit was driven by an $83 million higher non-fuel operating expense due in large part to increased capacity, and higher raw fuel costs, partially offset by a $40 million increase in revenue. 47 Horizon Horizon incurred a pretax loss of $8 million in 2017 compared to pretax profit of $10 million in 2016 . The change was primarily driven by $20 million higher non-fuel operating expenses. Non-fuel expenses increased primarily due to higher wage and training expense as a result of the increase in FTE's, increased costs associated with flight cancellations, and a $9 million ratification bonus expense in connection with the agreement reached with Horizon's pilots. LIQUIDITY AND CAPITAL RESOURCES Our primary sources of liquidity are: Our existing cash and marketable securities balance of $1.2 billion , and our expected cash from operations; Our 104 unencumbered aircraft in the operating fleet as of December 31, 2018 , that could be financed, if necessary; and Our combined bank line-of-credit facilities, with no outstanding borrowings, of $400 million . Information about these facilities can be found in Note 6 to the consolidated financial statements. In 2018 , we took delivery of eight owned B737-900ER and 16 owned E175 aircraft, made debt payments totaling $807 million , and secured $339 million of new borrowings. We also continued to return capital to our shareholders by paying dividends totaling $158 million and repurchasing $50 million of our common stock. Because of our strong balance sheet and financial performance, we are one of only three airlines in the U.S. with investment grade credit ratings. We believe that our current cash and marketable securities balance, combined with future cash flows from operations and other sources of liquidity, will be sufficient to fund our operations and meet our debt payment obligations for the foreseeable future. In our cash and marketable securities portfolio, we invest only in securities that meet our primary investment strategy of maintaining and securing investment principal. The portfolio is managed by reputable firms that adhere to our investment policy that sets forth investment objectives, approved and prohibited investments, and duration and credit quality guidelines. Our policy, and the portfolio managers, are continually reviewed to ensure that the investments are aligned with our strategy. The table below presents the major indicators of financial condition and liquidity: (in millions, except per share and debt-to-capital amounts) December 31, 2018 December 31, 2017 Change Cash and marketable securities $1,236 $1,621 $(385) Cash, marketable securities and unused lines of credit as a percentage of trailing twelve months revenue 20% 26% (6) pts Long-term debt, net of current portion $1,617 $2,262 $(645) Shareholders equity $3,751 $3,460 $291 Long-term debt-to-capital including net present value of aircraft operating lease payments (a) 47% 53% (6) pts (a) Calculated using the present value of remaining aircraft lease payments for aircraft that are in our operating fleet as of the balance sheet date. In 2019, following the adoption of the new lease accounting standard, this calculation will be performed utilizing the lease right-of-use asset as capitalized on our balance sheet. It is not expected to significantly change the ratio. The following discussion summarizes the primary drivers of the increase in our cash and marketable securities balance and our expectation of future cash requirements. ANALYSIS OF OUR CASH FLOWS Cash Provided by Operating Activities Net cash provided by operating activities was $1.2 billion in 2018 compared to $1.6 billion in 2017 . The decrease of $395 million is primarily due to a decrease in our net income for reasons previously discussed. 48 In 2017 , we generated $1.6 billion in operating cash flows compared to $1.4 billion in 2016 . The increase of $204 million was due to an increase in our net income. We typically generate positive cash flows from operations, and expect to use that cash flow to buy aircraft and capital equipment, to make debt payments, and to return capital to shareholders. During 2016, we paused our share repurchase program as we prepared for the acquisition of Virgin America. We resumed our share repurchase program in the second quarter of 2017 and continued the program in 2018 . Cash Used in Investing Activities Cash used in investing activities was $631 million during 2018 , compared to $1.1 billion in 2017 . Our capital expenditures were $960 million , or $66 million lower than 2017 , primarily due to the deferral of Mainline deliveries in 2018, offset by an increase in non-aircraft spend related to the retrofit of our fleet and corporate real estate projects. Cash used in investing activities was also impacted by net sales of marketable securities of $282 million in 2018 compared to net purchases in 2017 of $181 million. The shift to net sales is primarily due to funds being utilized to prepay certain debt. For further information regarding our future expected capital expenditures, please refer to the Contractual Obligations and Commitments section below. Cash used in investing activities was $1.1 billion during 2017 , compared to $2.6 billion in 2016 . In 2016, we used $2 billion to acquire Virgin America, representing $2.6 billion consideration paid, offset by $645 million of cash acquired. This cash outlay was offset by increased capital expenditures in 2017, which were $1 billion in 2017 , $348 million higher than in 2016, and was a result of the purchase of more aircraft in 2017. Cash Used in Financing Activities Cash used in financing activities was $647 million during 2018 , compared to cash used in financing activities of $592 million in 2017 . During the year, we made debt payments of $807 million , repurchased $50 million of our common stock and paid cash dividends of $158 million . During the fourth quarter of 2018, we secured new debt financing from multiple lenders of $339 million which replaced certain debt previously retired. In 2017 , we made debt payments of $397 million , repurchased $75 million of our common stock and made cash dividend payments of $148 million . In 2016 , we secured debt proceeds of $2 billion for the acquisition of Virgin America, made debt payments of $249 million , repurchased $193 million of our common stock and made cash dividend payments of $136 million . We plan to meet our future capital and operating commitments through our cash and investments on hand, internally generated cash from operations, along with additional debt financing if necessary. Bank Lines of Credit We have three credit facilities with availability totaling $516 million , including one $250 million credit facility, one $150 million credit facility, and one $116 million credit facility. We have secured letters of credit against the $116 million facility but have no plans to borrow using either of the two remaining facilities. CONTRACTUAL OBLIGATIONS AND COMMITMENTS Aircraft Purchase and Lease Commitments As of December 31, 2018 , we have firm orders to purchase or lease 48 aircraft. We also have cancelable purchase commitments for 30 Airbus A320neo aircraft with deliveries from 2022 through 2024 . We could incur a loss of pre-delivery payments and credits as a cancellation fee. We also have options to acquire up to 37 additional B737 aircraft with deliveries from 2021 through 2024 and 30 E175 aircraft with deliveries from 2021 to 2023 . In addition to the 32 E175 aircraft currently operated by SkyWest in our regional fleet, we have options in future periods to add regional capacity by having SkyWest operate up to eight more E175 aircraft. We expect capital expenditures to be approximately $750 million in both 2019 and 2020 . We currently expect delivery of seven owned Mainline jet aircraft and four owned Regional jet aircraft in 2019 . 49 The following table summarizes our expected fleet count by year, as of February 15, 2019 : Actual Fleet Count Contractual Deliveries (a) Aircraft Dec 31, 2017 Dec 31, 2018 2019 Changes Dec 31, 2019 2020 Changes Dec 31, 2020 B737 Freighters 3 3 3 3 B737 Passenger Aircraft (c) 151 159 7 166 2 168 Airbus Passenger Aircraft 67 71 1 72 (2 ) 70 Total Mainline Fleet 221 233 8 241 241 Q400 operated by Horizon (b) 50 39 (8 ) 31 (8 ) 23 E175 operated by Horizon (b) 10 26 4 30 30 E175 operated by third party (b) 23 32 32 32 Total Regional Fleet 83 97 (4 ) 93 (8 ) 85 Total 304 330 4 334 (8 ) 326 (a) The expected fleet counts at December 31, 2019 and 2020 are subject to change. (b) Aircraft are either owned or leased by Horizon or operated under capacity purchase agreement with a third party. (c) Aircraft deliveries reflect the supplemental agreement entered with Boeing in the first quarter of 2018 which deferred certain B737 deliveries. Our first MAX9 delivery is scheduled for 2019. For future firm orders and option exercises, we may finance the aircraft through cash from operations, long-term debt, or lease arrangements. Future Fuel Hedge Positions All of our future oil positions are call options, which are designed to effectively cap the cost of the crude oil component of our jet fuel purchases. With call options, we are hedged against volatile crude oil price increases; and, during a period of decline in crude oil prices, we only forfeit cash previously paid for hedge premiums. Our crude oil positions are as follows: Approximate % of Expected Fuel Requirements Weighted-Average Crude Oil Price per Barrel Average Premium Cost per Barrel First Quarter 2019 50% $72 $1 Second Quarter 2019 50% $76 $1 Third Quarter 2019 40% $77 $2 Fourth Quarter 2019 30% $76 $2 Full Year 2019 42% $75 $2 First Quarter 2020 20% $70 $3 Second Quarter 2020 10% $64 $3 Full Year 2020 7% $68 $3 50 Contractual Obligations The following table provides a summary of our obligations as of December 31, 2018 . For agreements with variable terms, amounts included reflect our minimum obligations. (in millions) 2019 2020 2021 2022 2023 Beyond Total Current and long-term debt obligations $ 488 $ 305 $ 263 $ 216 $ 262 $ 579 $ 2,113 Aircraft leases (a) 350 320 286 262 208 847 2,273 Facility lease commitments (b) 133 124 113 94 26 122 612 Aircraft maintenance deposits (c) 61 65 59 48 24 8 265 Aircraft commitments (d) 495 517 556 307 108 33 2,016 Interest obligations (e) 70 56 44 35 27 44 276 Other obligations (f) 145 152 173 181 186 1,079 1,916 Total $ 1,742 $ 1,539 $ 1,494 $ 1,143 $ 841 $ 2,712 $ 9,471 (a) Aircraft lease commitments generally include aircraft operating leases, including E175 aircraft operated by SkyWest under a capacity purchase agreement. Upon our transition to the new leasing standard, aircraft leases will be capitalized as a right-to-use asset on our balance sheet. (b) Facility lease commitments generally include airport property and hangar leases, office space, and other equipment leases. Upon our transition to the new leasing standard, certain of these leases will be capitalized as a right-to-use asset on our balance sheet. (c) Aircraft maintenance deposits relate to leased Airbus aircraft, and the power-by-the-hour agreement for the B737-800 fleet. (d) Represents non-cancelable contractual payment commitments for aircraft and engines. (e) For variable-rate debt, future obligations are shown above using interest rates forecast as of December 31, 2018 . (f) Primarily comprised of non-aircraft lease costs associated with capacity purchase agreements. Defined Benefit Pensions The table above excludes contributions to our various pension plans, for which there are no minimum required contributions given the funded status of the plans. The unfunded liability for our qualified defined-benefit pension plans was $367 million at December 31, 2018 , compared to a $304 million unfunded position at December 31, 2017 . This results in an 84% funded status on a projected benefit obligation basis compared to 87% funded as of December 31, 2017 . There were no contributions in 2018 to the plans. Credit Card Agreements We have agreements with a number of credit card companies to process the sale of tickets and other services. Under these agreements, there are material adverse change clauses that, if triggered, could result in the credit card companies holding back a reserve from our credit card receivables. Under one such agreement, we could be required to maintain a reserve if our credit rating is downgraded to or below a rating specified by the agreement or our cash and marketable securities balance fell below $500 million. Under another such agreement, we could be required to maintain a reserve if our cash and marketable securities balance fell below $500 million. We are not currently required to maintain any reserve under these agreements, but if we were, our financial position and liquidity could be materially harmed. Deferred Income Taxes For federal income tax purposes, the majority of our assets are fully depreciated over a seven-year life using an accelerated depreciation method or bonus depreciation, if available. For financial reporting purposes, the majority of our assets are depreciated over 15 to 25 years to an estimated salvage value using the straight-line basis. This difference has created a significant deferred tax liability. At some point in the future the depreciation basis will reverse, potentially resulting in an increase in income taxes paid. While it is possible that we could have material cash obligations for this deferred liability at some point in the future, we cannot estimate the timing of long-term cash flows with reasonable accuracy. Taxable income and cash taxes payable in the short-term are impacted by many items, including the amount of book income generated (which can be volatile depending on revenue and fuel prices), usage of net operating losses, whether bonus depreciation provisions are available, any future tax reform efforts at the federal level, as well as other legislative changes that are beyond our control. In 2018 , we had no net tax payments and had an effective tax rate of 25.3% . We believe that we will have the liquidity available to make our future tax payments. 51 CRITICAL ACCOUNTING ESTIMATES The discussion and analysis of our financial position and results of operations in this MD&A are based upon our consolidated financial statements. The preparation of these financial statements requires us to make estimates and judgments that affect our financial position and results of operations. See Note 1 to the consolidated financial statements for a description of our significant accounting policies. Critical accounting estimates are defined as those that reflect significant management judgment and uncertainties and that potentially may lead to materially different results under varying assumptions and conditions. Management has identified the following critical accounting estimates and has discussed the development, selection and disclosure of these policies with our audit committee. FREQUENT FLYER PROGRAMS Alaska's Mileage Plan loyalty program awards mileage credits to members who fly on our airlines and our airline partners, referred to as flown miles. We also sell services, including miles for transportation, Companion Fare certificates, bag fee waivers, and access to our brand and customer lists to a major bank that offers Alaska affinity credit cards. To a lesser extent, miles for transportation are also sold to other non-airline partners, such as hotels, and car rental agencies. The outstanding miles may be redeemed for travel on our airlines or any of our airline partners, and for non-airline products such as hotels. As long as the Mileage Plan is in existence, we have an obligation to provide this future travel. Mileage credits and the various other services we sell under our loyalty program represent performance obligations that are part of a multiple deliverable revenue arrangement. Accounting guidance requires that we use a relative standalone selling price allocation to allocate consideration received to the material performance obligations in these contracts. Our relative standalone selling price allocation models are refreshed when contracts originate or are materially modified. At December 31, 2018 , we had approximately 243 billion miles outstanding, resulting in an aggregate deferred revenue balance of $1.9 billion . The deferred revenue resulting from our relative selling price allocations requires significant management judgment. There are uncertainties inherent in these estimates. Therefore, different assumptions could affect the amount and/or timing of revenue recognition or expenses. The most significant assumptions are described below. 1. The rate at which we defer sales proceeds related to services sold: We estimate the standalone selling price for each performance obligation, including mileage credits, by considering multiple inputs and methods, including but not limited to, the estimated selling price of comparable travel, discounted cash flows, brand value published selling prices, number of miles awarded, and the number of miles redeemed. We estimate the selling prices and volumes over the terms of the agreements in order to determine the allocation of proceeds to each of the multiple deliverables. 2. The number of miles that will not be redeemed for travel (breakage): We estimate how many miles will be used per award. For example, our members may redeem mileage credits for award travel to various locations or choose between a highly restricted award and an unrestricted award. Our estimates are based on the current requirements in our Mileage Plan program and historical award redemption patterns. We regularly review significant Mileage Plan assumptions and change our assumptions if facts and circumstances indicate that a change is necessary. Any such change in assumptions could have a significant effect on our financial position and results of operations.
