ITEM 7. MANAGEMENT S DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS OF FINANCIAL CONDITION AND RESULTS OF OPERATIONS (continued) N I S OURCE I NC . Electric Operations (continued) Net Revenues Net revenues were $886.6 million for 2011, an increase of $7.6 million from the same period in 2010, primarily due to increased industrial usage and margins of $18.7 million resulting from improved economic conditions, $9.5 million in lower revenue credits compared to the prior year, and higher environmental trackers of $5.5 million, which are offset in expense. These increases were partially offset by a decrease in residential and commercial margins of $12.2 million, and lower environmental cost recovery of $12.0 million due to a decrease in net plant eligible for a return and a decrease in the allowed rate of return. Net revenues were $879.0 million for 2010, an increase of $113.1 million from 2009. This increase was primarily the result of higher industrial usage and margins of $45.1 million due to improved economic conditions, warmer weather of approximately $35 million, and a $17.1 million increase in environmental trackers, which are partially offset in operating expenses. Additionally, there was an increase of $14.6 million in off-system sales, including a reduction of $8.2 million in off-system sales in 2009 resulting from a FAC settlement. At Northern Indiana, sales revenues and customer billings are adjusted for amounts related to under and over-recovered purchased fuel costs from prior periods per regulatory order. These amounts are primarily reflected in the Other gross revenues statistic provided at the beginning of this segment discussion. The adjustment to Other gross revenues for the twelve months ended December 31, 2011 and 2010 was a revenue decrease of $20.6 million and a revenue increase of $46.5 million, respectively. Operating Income Operating income for 2011 was $209.5 million, a decrease of $11.3 million from the same period in 2010 due to higher operating expenses partially offset by higher net revenues described above. Operating expenses increased $18.9 million due primarily to increased employee and administrative costs of $14.8 million and higher outside service costs of $8.4 million. These increases were partially offset by a $4.9 million one-time inventory adjustment recorded in the prior period. Operating income for 2010 was $220.8 million, an increase of $103.9 million from 2009. The increase in operating income was due to increased net revenues described above partially offset by an increase in operating expenses of $9.2 million. The increase in operating expenses was the result of an increase of $7.8 million in other taxes, primarily property, a charge of $5.9 million for inventory disposal and other costs associated with the rate case, higher electric generation costs of $5.5 million, and an increase of $5.6 million in depreciation costs. These were partially offset by $10.0 million for a legal reserve which was recorded in 2009, $3.6 million for lower restructuring costs, and $3.2 million in lower uncollectible costs. 62 Table of Contents
