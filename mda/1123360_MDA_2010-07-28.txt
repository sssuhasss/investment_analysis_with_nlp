ITEM 7 MANAGEMENT S DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS OF FINANCIAL CONDITION AND RESULTS OF OPERATIONS The following discussion and analysis contains forward-looking statements about our plans and expectations of what may happen in the future. Forward-looking statements are based on a number of assumptions and estimates that are inherently subject to significant risks and uncertainties, and our results could differ materially from the results anticipated by our forward-looking statements as a result of many known and unknown factors, including but not limited to those discussed in Item 1A Risk Factors of this report. See also Cautionary Notice Regarding Forward-Looking Statements located above Item 1 Business. You should read the following discussion and analysis in conjunction with Item 6 Selected Financial Data and Item 8 Financial Statements and Supplementary Data appearing elsewhere in this annual report. General We are a leading provider of electronic payments transaction processing services for consumers, merchants, Independent Sales Organizations (ISOs), financial institutions, government agencies and multi-national corporations located throughout the United States, Canada, the United Kingdom, the Asia-Pacific region, the Czech Republic and the Russian Federation. We serve as an intermediary to facilitate payments transactions and operate in two business segments, North America Merchant Services and International Merchant Services. We were incorporated in Georgia as Global Payments Inc. in September 2000, and we spun-off from our former parent company on January 31, 2001. Including our time as part of our former parent company, we have been in business since 1967. Our North America Merchant Services and International Merchant Services segments target customers in many vertical industries including financial institutions, gaming, government, health care, professional services, restaurants, retail, universities, nonprofit organizations and utilities. Our offerings provide merchants, ISOs and financial institutions with credit and debit card transaction processing and check-related services. We use two basic business models to market our merchant services offerings. One model, referred to as direct, features a salaried and commissioned sales force, ISOs and independent sales representatives, all of whom sell our end-to-end services directly to merchants. Our other model, referred to as indirect, provides similar basic products and services to financial institutions and a limited number of ISOs on an unbundled basis, who in turn resell our products and services to clients. Both our North America and International merchant services segments utilize a combination of the direct and indirect models. Direct merchant services revenue is generated on services generally priced as a percentage of transaction value, whereas indirect merchant services revenue is generated on services primarily priced on a specified amount per transaction or per service rendered. In both merchant services models, we also charge other fees unrelated to the number of transactions or the transaction value. Our products and services are marketed through a variety of sales channels that include a dedicated direct sales force, ISOs, an internal telesales group, retail outlets, trade associations, alliance bank relationships and financial institutions. We seek to leverage the rapid adoption of, and transition to, card based payments by expanding market share in our existing markets through our distribution channels or through acquisitions in North America, the Asia-Pacific region and Europe, and investing in and leveraging technology and people, thereby maximizing shareholder value. We also seek to enter new markets through acquisitions in the Asia-Pacific region, Europe, and South America. Executive Overview On May 26, 2010, we completed the disposition of our DolEx and Europhil-branded money transfer businesses to an affiliate of Palladium Equity Partners, LLC for $85.0 million. We recognized an estimated 25 Table of Contents Index to Financial Statements pre-tax loss on disposal of $24.6 million. We also recognized $15.7 million of tax benefits associated with the disposition. As a result of our decision to dispose of the money transfer businesses, this segment has been accounted for as a discontinued operation. Amounts related to our discontinued operations in our prior fiscal years statements of income have been reclassified to conform with the presentation in the current fiscal year. Please see Note 3 Discontinued Operations in the notes to the consolidated financial statements for further information. On September 28, 2009, we completed the acquisition of Auctionpay, Inc., a provider of fully integrated payment processing and software solutions for fundraising activities. We paid a total of $22.0 million in cash to acquire Auctionpay, Inc. The purpose of this acquisition was to expand our direct acquiring business into a vertical market that, to date, is still heavily dependent on cash and check as the primary means of payment. Auctionpay, Inc. is currently known as Greater Giving. On June 12, 2009, we completed the purchase of the remaining 49% of HSBC Merchant Services LLP from HSBC Bank plc. Total consideration for such remaining interest was $307.7 million in cash. We used the existing lines of credit to complete the transaction. We acquired our initial majority ownership interest in the LLP on June 30, 2008. On July 10, 2009, we entered into a new $300.0 million term loan agreement ($230.0 million and 43.5 million) with a syndicate of financial institutions. We used the proceeds of this term loan to pay down our existing credit facility which was used to fund the purchase of our remaining 49% interest in the LLP. The term loan expires in 2012 and has a variable interest rate based on London Interbank Offered Rate plus a margin based on our leverage position. Revenues increased $180.2 million during fiscal 2010 compared to the prior year. Macroeconomic conditions have caused our average dollar per transaction (average ticket) amounts to decline across our geographic regions compared to the prior year. However, we continue to grow revenue in most of our direct merchant acquiring markets around the world. Our North America merchant services segment reported growth primarily driven by our direct ISO channel which continues to drive expanding market share in the United States as evidenced by our 18% transaction growth compared to the prior year. While our revenues in Canada were affected positively by favorable foreign currency trends, our Canadian business continues to be affected by challenging macroeconomic conditions resulting in reduced spreads due to market-driven pricing pressure as compared to the prior year. Revenues increased 19% in our International merchant services segment compared to the prior year. This growth reflects the impact of our April 30, 2009 acquisition of UCS in the Russian Federation, favorable currency trends in the United Kingdom and business performance in the United Kingdom and in the Asia-Pacific region. For the fiscal year 2010 currency exchange rate fluctuations increased our revenues by $16.5 million and our earnings by $0.10 per diluted share. To calculate this impact, we converted our fiscal 2010 actual revenues and expenses from continuing operations at fiscal 2009 currency exchange rates. Further fluctuations in currency exchange rates or decreases in consumer spending could cause our results to differ from our current expectations. 26 Table of Contents Index to Financial Statements Results of Operations Fiscal Year Ended May 31, 2010 Compared to Fiscal Year Ended May 31, 2009 The following table shows key selected financial data for the fiscal years ended May 31, 2010 and 2009, this data as a percentage of total revenues, and the changes between fiscal years in dollars and as a percentage of fiscal 2009. 2010 % of Revenue (1) 2009 % of Revenue (1) Change % Change (dollar amounts in thousands) Revenues: United States $ 902,844 55 % $ 805,557 55 % $ 97,287 12 % Canada 317,272 19 301,294 21 15,978 5 North America merchant services 1,220,116 74 1,106,851 76 113,265 10 Europe 315,023 19 265,121 18 49,902 19 Asia-Pacific 107,329 7 90,334 6 16,995 19 International merchant services 422,352 26 355,455 24 66,897 19 Total revenues $ 1,642,468 100 % $ 1,462,306 100 % $ 180,162 12 % Consolidated operating expenses: Cost of service $ 584,609 35.6 % $ 504,855 34.5 % $ 79,754 16 % Sales, general and administrative 734,580 44.7 664,905 45.5 69,675 10 Operating income $ 323,279 19.7 % $ 292,546 20.0 % $ 30,733 10 % Operating income for segments: North America merchant services $ 275,386 $ 272,972 $ 2,414 1 % International merchant services 113,699 82,763 30,936 37 Corporate (65,806 ) (63,189 ) (2,617 ) (4 ) Operating income $ 323,279 $ 292,546 $ 30,733 10 % Operating margin for segments: North America merchant services 22.6 % 24.7 % (2.1 )% International merchant services 26.9 % 23.3 % 3.6 % (1) Percentage amounts may not sum to the total due to rounding. Revenues We derive our revenues from three primary sources: charges based on volumes and fees for services, charges based on transaction quantity and equipment sales, leases and service fees. Revenues generated by these areas depend upon a number of factors, such as demand for and price of our services, the technological competitiveness of our product offerings, our reputation for providing timely and reliable service, competition within our industry and general economic conditions. In fiscal 2010, revenues increased 12% to $1,642.5 million compared to the prior year. North America Merchant Services Segment In fiscal 2010, revenue from our North America merchant services segment increased 10% to $1,220.1 million compared to the prior year. We have grown our United States revenue by adding small and mid-market merchants in diversified vertical markets, primarily through our ISO channel. For fiscal 2010, our United States direct credit and debit card processed transactions grew 18%, and our total United States revenue grew 12% compared to the prior year. In 27 Table of Contents Index to Financial Statements fiscal 2010 compared to the prior year, our United States direct credit and debit card average dollar value of transaction, or average ticket, decreased approximately 8%. We believe this decline is due to a combination of lower consumer spending as a result of a weakened economy, the industry shift of increasing debit transactions and a shift toward smaller merchants added through our ISO channel. Smaller merchants tend to have lower average tickets than larger merchants. The effect of consumers replacing cash-based payments with debit card transactions and the increasing acceptance of credit cards for small dollar transactions also lowers our overall average ticket amounts. Based on our mix of merchants, approximately 60% of our United States transactions are comprised of a combination of signature- and PIN-based debit transactions, with PIN-based debit transactions representing less than 10% of our total transactions. Aside from the impact of changes in our average ticket, the remaining differences between our transaction growth and revenue growth are due to our service fees, equipment fees, check-related services and our domestic indirect revenue. Revenue from these services grew at a lesser rate than our credit and debit card transaction growth. For fiscal 2010, our Canadian revenue increased 5% compared to the prior year. This growth was due to favorable foreign currency trends, offset by challenging macroeconomic conditions which resulted in reduced spreads due to market-driven pricing pressure as compared to the prior year. International Merchant Services Segment For fiscal 2010, International merchant services revenue increased 19% to $422.4 million compared to the prior year. Our Europe merchant services revenue for fiscal 2010 increased 19% to $315.0 million compared to the prior year. This growth was primarily due to our April 30, 2009 acquisition of UCS in the Russian Federation, in addition to solid business performance in the United Kingdom. Asia-Pacific merchant services revenue for fiscal 2010 increased 19% to $107.3 million compared to the prior year period. The growth was primarily due to business performance in the Asia Pacific region driven in part by the increasing penetration of dynamic currency conversion products in the region. The growth for the fiscal 2010 also reflects our acquisition of Global Payments Asia-Pacific Philippines Incorporated on September 4, 2008. Consolidated Operating Expenses Cost of service consists primarily of the following costs: operations-related personnel, including those who monitor our transaction processing systems and settlement functions; assessment fees paid to card networks; transaction processing systems, including third-party services such as the costs of settlement channels for transition services paid to HSBC in the Asia-Pacific market and the United Kingdom; network telecommunications capability, depreciation and occupancy costs associated with the facilities performing these functions; amortization of intangible assets; and provisions for operating losses. Cost of service increased 16% to $584.6 million for fiscal 2010 compared to the prior year comparable period. As a percentage of revenue, cost of service increased to 35.6% of revenue for the fiscal 2010 from 34.5% for the prior year. The growth in cost of service expenses was due to our UCS acquisition, increases in variable processing expenses such as card network assessments and fees associated with our revenue growth and the impact of our June 30, 2008 acquisition of 51% of HSBC Merchant Services LLP. Sales, general and administrative expenses consists primarily of salaries, wages and related expenses paid to sales personnel, non-revenue producing customer support functions and administrative employees and management, commissions to independent contractors and ISOs, advertising costs, other selling expenses, share-based compensation expenses and occupancy of leased space directly related to these functions. Sales, general and administrative expenses increased 10% to $734.6 million for fiscal 2010 compared to the prior year comparable period. As a percentage of revenue, these expenses decreased to 44.7% for fiscal 2010 compared to 45.5% in the prior year comparable period. 28 Table of Contents Index to Financial Statements Operating Income and Operating Margin for Segments For the purpose of discussing segment operations, we refer to operating income as calculated by subtracting segment direct expenses from segment revenue. Overhead and shared expenses, including share-based compensation costs, are not allocated to the segments operations; they are reported in the caption Corporate. Similarly, references to operating margin regarding segment operations mean segment operating income divided by segment revenue. North America Merchant Services Segment Operating income in the North America merchant services segment increased 1% to $275.4 million for fiscal 2010 compared to the prior year comparable period. The operating margin was 22.6% and 24.7% for the fiscal years ended, 2010 and 2009, respectively. Growth in the United States ISO channel reduced margins for fiscal 2010. The ISO channel generally has a dilutive effect on our operating margin compared to our other channels due to the ongoing commission payments to the ISOs. International Merchant Services Segment Operating income in the International merchant services segment increased 37% to $113.7 million for fiscal 2010 compared to the prior year comparable period. The operating margin was 26.9% and 23.3% for the fiscal years ended, 2010 and 2009, respectively. The increase in operating margin is due to the acquisition of HSBC Merchant Services LLP and the higher operating margins in the United Kingdom and expanding margins in the Asia-Pacific region. Corporate Our corporate expenses primarily include costs associated with our Atlanta headquarters, insurance, employee incentive programs, and certain corporate staffing areas, including finance, accounting, legal, human resources, marketing, and executive. Our corporate costs increased 4% to $65.8 million for fiscal 2010 compared to the prior year comparable period. Consolidated Operating Income During fiscal 2010, our consolidated operating income increased $30.7 million to $323.3 million compared to the prior year comparable period. This increase was primarily due to the impact of growth in our International merchant services segment. Consolidated Other Income/Expense, Net Other income and expense consists primarily of interest income and interest expense. Other expense, net increased to $12.9 million for fiscal 2010 compared to $0.3 million in the prior year comparable period. This increase in other expense, net was primarily due to higher debt balances and, to a lesser extent, lower interest income. Interest rates decreased during fiscal 2010 when compared to the prior year. This decline in interest rates partially offset the impact of increased debt balances on interest expense and contributed to lower interest income. Provision for Income Taxes Our effective tax rates were 29.6% and 33.0% for fiscal years, 2010 and 2009, respectively. The reductions of our effective tax rates are due to domestic and international tax planning initiatives and the increasing amount of income being generated in lower tax jurisdictions due to international expansion. 29 Table of Contents Index to Financial Statements We have net deferred tax assets associated with our UK business of $87.5 million. The measurement of such deferred tax assets is based, in part, on the current enacted corporate tax in the UK of 28%. The 2010 UK budget announced June 22, 2010 includes a reduction in the corporate tax rate from 28% to 24% over the course of four financial years from April 2011. Upon enactment of these tax rates, which is expected during the first half of our fiscal year 2011, we estimate that we will record a reduction of our UK deferred tax asset and a corresponding increase to our deferred income tax provision of approximately $9 million. Loss from Discontinued Operations, Net of Tax During fiscal 2010, we reported a net loss from discontinued operations of $3.9 million ($0.04 diluted loss per share) compared to a net loss of $132.8 million ($1.64 diluted loss per share) in the prior year. The prior year results reflect our pre-tax impairment charge of $147.7 million in our money transfer business during the three months ended February 28, 2009. During fiscal 2010, loss from discontinued operations, net of tax includes an estimated pre-tax loss on disposal of $24.6 million and an income tax benefit associated with the disposal of $15.7 million. Net Income Attributable to Noncontrolling Interests, Net of Tax Noncontrolling interests, net of tax decreased to $15.8 million from $37.0 million for the fiscal years 2010 and 2009, respectively. The decrease was due to our June 2009 acquisition of the remaining 49% of HSBC Merchant Services LLP. Net Income Attributable to Global Payments and Diluted Earnings Per Share During fiscal 2010 we reported net income of $203.3 million ($2.48 diluted earnings per share). New Accounting Pronouncements In December 2009, the Financial Accounting Standards Board ( FASB ) issued ASU 2009-17, Improvements to Financial Reporting by Enterprises Involved with Variable Interest Entities (ASU 2009-17). ASU 2009-17 amends prior accounting for variable interests and requires a company to perform an analysis to determine whether its interests give it a controlling financial interest in a variable interest entity. A company must also assess whether it has the power to direct the activities of the variable interest entity and whether it has the obligation to absorb losses or the right to receive benefits that could potentially be significant to the variable interest entity. ASU 2009-17 requires an ongoing reassessment of whether a company is the primary beneficiary of a variable interest entity, eliminates the quantitative approach previously required for determining the primary beneficiary of a variable interest entity and expands required disclosures. ASU 2009-17 is effective for our fiscal year beginning June 1, 2010 and is not expected to have an impact on our consolidated financial statements. On June 1, 2009 we adopted FASB guidance that establishes principles and requirements for how we recognize and measure in our financial statements the identifiable assets acquired, the liabilities assumed, and any noncontrolling interest acquired in a business combination. In addition, this guidance establishes principles and requirements for how we recognize and measure the goodwill acquired in the business combination or gain from a bargain purchase, and how we determine what information to disclose to enable financial statement users to evaluate the nature and financial effects of the business combination. On June 1, 2009, we adopted FASB guidance that applies to the accounting for noncontrolling interests (formerly referred to as minority interest) in a subsidiary and for the deconsolidation of a subsidiary. With the adoption of this guidance, noncontrolling interests that are not redeemable were reclassified from the mezzanine section of the consolidated balance sheet to permanent equity but separate from Global Payments shareholders equity. Income or loss associated with noncontrolling interests is required to be presented separately, net of tax, below net income including noncontrolling interests on the consolidated statement of income. The presentation and disclosure requirements of the guidance have been applied retrospectively. 30 Table of Contents Index to Financial Statements We have a noncontrolling interest that includes redemption provisions that are not solely within our control, commonly referred to as a redeemable noncontrolling interest. This redeemable noncontrolling interest remains in the mezzanine section of the consolidated balance sheet. The guidance allows for a choice of either accreting redeemable noncontrolling interest to its redemption value over the redemption period or recognizing changes in the redemption value immediately as they occur. We have elected to recognize the changes in the redemption value immediately. The presentation and disclosure requirements of the guidance have been applied retrospectively. The retrospective adoption of the guidance resulted in recording the maximum redemption amount of our redeemable noncontrolling interests with a corresponding decrease in retained earnings for all periods presented. Please see Note 12 Noncontrolling Interests in the notes to consolidated financial statements for further information. On June 1, 2009, we adopted FASB guidance that requires unvested share-based payment awards that contain non-forfeitable rights to dividends or dividend equivalents (whether paid or unpaid) to be accounted for as participating securities and therefore included in the computation of earnings per share ( EPS ). Pursuant to the adoption of the guidance, prior period EPS data presented has been adjusted retrospectively. The adoption of the guidance resulted in an immaterial change to our weighted-average shares outstanding but did not affect our earnings per share. In June 2009, the FASB issued a statement which establishes the FASB Accounting Standards Codification ( ASC ). The ASC establishes two levels of GAAP authoritative and non-authoritative. The ASC is the source of authoritative, nongovernmental GAAP, except for rules and interpretive releases of the Securities and Exchange Commission. Effective for financial statements issued for interim and annual periods ending after September 15, 2009, we adopted the ASC in the second quarter of fiscal 2010. The adoption of the ASC did not impact our consolidated financial statements. 31 Table of Contents Index to Financial Statements Fiscal Year Ended May 31, 2009 Compared to Fiscal Year Ended May 31, 2008 The following table shows key selected financial data for the fiscal years ended May 31, 2009 and 2008, this data as a percentage of total revenues, and the changes between fiscal years in dollars and as a percentage of fiscal 2008. 2009 % of Revenue (1) 2008 % of Revenue (1) Change % Change (dollar amounts in thousands) Revenues: United States $ 805,557 55 % $ 731,214 65 % $ 74,343 10 % Canada 301,294 21 267,249 24 34,045 13 North America merchant services 1,106,851 76 998,463 88 108,388 11 Europe 265,121 18 59,778 5 205,343 344 Asia-Pacific 90,334 6 72,367 6 17,967 25 International merchant services 355,455 24 132,145 12 223,310 169 Total revenues $ 1,462,306 100 % $ 1,130,608 100 % $ 331,698 29 % Consolidated operating expenses: Cost of service $ 504,855 34.5 % $ 375,817 33.2 % $ 129,038 34 % Sales, general and administrative 664,905 45.5 515,751 45.6 149,154 29 Impairment, restructuring and other 1,317 0.1 (1,317 ) NM Operating income $ 292,546 20.0 % $ 237,723 21.0 % $ 54,823 23 % Operating income for segments: North America merchant services $ 272,972 $ 275,355 $ (2,383 ) (1 )% International merchant services 82,763 17,674 65,089 368 Corporate (63,189 ) (53,989 ) (9,200 ) (17 ) Impairment, restructuring and other (1,317 ) 1,317 NM Operating income $ 292,546 $ 237,723 $ 54,823 23 % Operating margin for segments: North America merchant services 24.7 % 27.6 % (2.9 )% International merchant services 23.3 % 13.4 % 9.9 % (1) Percentage amounts may not sum to the total due to rounding. NM Not Meaningful Revenues In fiscal 2009, revenues increased 29% to $1,462.3 million compared to the prior year. We attribute this revenue growth primarily to our acquisition of 51% of HSBC Merchant Services LLP in our International merchant services segment and to growth in our North America merchant services segment. This growth was partially offset by fluctuations in foreign currency exchange rates. For fiscal 2009, currency exchange rate fluctuations reduced our revenues by $86.9 million. North America Merchant Services Segment In fiscal 2009, revenue from our North America merchant services segment increased 11% to $1,106.9 million compared to the prior year. We have continued to grow our United States channel by adding small and mid-market merchants in diversified vertical markets, primarily through our ISOs. For fiscal 2009, our United States direct credit and debit card processed transactions grew 17% and our total United States revenue grew 32 Table of Contents Index to Financial Statements 10% compared to the prior year. In fiscal 2009 compared to the prior year, our United States direct credit and debit card average dollar value of transaction, or average ticket, decreased in the high single-digit percentage range. We believe this decline was due to a combination of lower consumer spending as a result of a weakened economy, the industry shift to increasing debit transactions. as well as the shift toward smaller merchants added through our ISO channel. Smaller merchants tend to have lower average tickets than larger merchants. The effect of consumers replacing cash-based payments with debit card transactions also lowers our overall United States average ticket amounts. Based on our mix of merchants, slightly more than half of our United States transactions are comprised of a combination of signature- and PIN-based debit transactions. Aside from the impact of changes in our average ticket, the remaining difference between our transaction growth and revenue growth is due to our service fees, equipment fees, check-related services, and our domestic indirect revenue. Revenue from these services grew at a lower rate than our United States direct credit and debit card transaction growth. For fiscal 2009, our Canadian revenue grew 13% compared to the prior year period. This growth was primarily due to successful pricing initiatives and, to a lesser extent, transaction growth of 4%, partially offset by an unfavorable Canadian currency exchange rate. In addition, our average ticket in Canada declined in the low single-digit range, which we believe may be partially due to lower consumer spending as a result of a weakened economy. International Merchant Services Segment For fiscal 2009, our International merchant services revenue increased 169% to $355.5 million compared to the prior year. In Europe, this growth was primarily due to our acquisition of 51% of HSBC Merchant Services LLP. Revenues attributed to this acquisition were $203.5 million during fiscal 2009. Our Asia-Pacific merchant services revenue for fiscal 2009 increased 25% to $90.3 million compared to the prior year period. Our Asia-Pacific merchant services revenue has grown due to the favorable impact of our acquisition in the Philippines on September 4, 2008, expansion of our customer base, the introduction of new product offerings, and strategic pricing initiatives. Consolidated Operating Expenses Cost of service increased 34% to $504.9 million for fiscal 2009 compared to the prior year. The growth in cost of service expenses is primarily due to the acquisition of 51% of HSBC Merchant Services LLP and increases in variable processing expenses, such as card network assessments and fees, associated with our revenue growth. Sales, general and administrative expenses increased 29% to $664.9 million in fiscal 2009 compared to the prior year. As a percentage of revenue, these expenses increased to 45.5% for fiscal 2009 compared to 45.6% in the prior year. The increase in sales, general and administrative expenses is due to growth in commission payments to ISOs resulting from the increased revenue in this sales channel and the acquisition of 51% of HSBC Merchant Services LLP. The ISO channel generally has a dilutive effect on our operating margin compared to our other channels due to the ongoing commission payments to the ISOs. In addition, during fiscal 2008 we recorded a favorable impact from a non-recurring, non-cash operating tax item of $7.0 million. Operating Income and Operating Margin for Segments North America Merchant Services Segment Operating income in the North America merchant services segment decreased 1% to $273.0 million for fiscal 2009 compared to the prior year. The operating margin was 24.7% and 27.6% for fiscal 2009 and fiscal 2008, respectively. The decrease in operating income in fiscal 2009 was primarily due to the negative impact of the Canadian Dollar exchange rate. In addition, fiscal 2008 reflects a favorable impact of a non-recurring, 33 Table of Contents Index to Financial Statements non-cash operating tax item of $7.0 million. Growth in the ISO channel also negatively impacted fiscal 2009 margins. The ISO channel generally has a dilutive effect on our operating margin compared to our other channels due to the ongoing commission payments to the ISOs. International Merchant Services Segment Operating income in the International merchant services segment increased 368% to $82.8 million for fiscal 2009 compared to the prior year. The operating margin was 23.3% and 13.4% for fiscal 2009 and fiscal 2008, respectively. This growth in operating margin and operating income was primarily due to the acquisition of 51% of HSBC Merchant Services LLP in the United Kingdom. Corporate Our corporate expenses primarily include costs associated with our Atlanta headquarters, insurance, employee incentive programs, and certain corporate staffing areas, including finance, accounting, legal, human resources, marketing, and executive. Corporate also includes expenses associated with our share-based compensation programs. Our corporate costs increased 17% to $63.2 million for fiscal 2009 compared to the prior year. Consolidated Operating Income Consolidated operating income increased 23% to $292.5 million for fiscal 2009 compared to the prior year. This change resulted in an operating margin of 20.0% for fiscal 2009 compared to 21.0% in the prior year. This decrease was primarily due to the unfavorable impact of foreign currency exchange rates somewhat offset by the favorable impact of the HSBC UK acquisition. Consolidated Other Income/Expense, Net Other income and expense consists primarily of interest income and interest expense. Other income, net decreased $9.3 million for fiscal 2009 compared to the prior year. This decrease was largely due to lower investment balances and rates of return. Interest rates decreased during fiscal year 2009 when compared to the prior year. This decline in interest rates resulted in lower interest income but also resulted in a decline in interest expense on increased debt balances. Provision for Income Taxes Our effective tax rates, reflected as the provision for income taxes divided by income from continuing operations before income tax, including the effect of noncontrolling interest, were 33.0% and 35.6% for fiscal 2009 and fiscal 2008, respectively. (Loss) income from Discontinued Operations, Net of Tax During the fiscal 2009, we reported a net loss from discontinued operations of $132.8 million ($1.64 diluted loss per share) compared to a net income of $9.6 million ($0.12 diluted earnings per share) in the prior year. Fiscal 2009 results reflect our pre-tax impairment charge of $147.7 million in our money transfer business. The downturn in the United States construction market, immigrant labor trends, and overall decrease in economic growth in the United States and Spain contributed to decreased projected future cash flows for our United States and Europe money transfer business. This decrease in projected cash flows resulted in the carrying amounts of these reporting units being greater than the fair values; therefore, goodwill was deemed impaired. Our DolEx trademark in our United States money transfer business was also deemed to be impaired. In addition, we reviewed the long-lived assets of these reporting units for impairment pursuant to the FASB guidance and recorded an impairment charge for certain of our long-lived assets. 34 Table of Contents Index to Financial Statements The following details the impairment charge resulting from our review (in thousands): Year Ended May 31, 2009 Goodwill $ 136,800 Trademark 10,000 Other long-lived assets 864 Total $ 147,664 Net Income Attributable to Noncontrolling Interests, Net of Tax Noncontrolling interest, net of tax increased $28.9 million from $8.1 million fiscal 2008. The increase was primarily related to our acquisition of a 51% majority interest in HSBC Merchant Services, LLP on June 30, 2008. Net Income Attributable to Global Payments and Diluted Earnings Per Share During fiscal 2009 we reported net income of $37.2 million ($0.46 diluted earnings per share). Liquidity and Capital Resources A significant portion of our liquidity comes from operating cash flows, which are generally sufficient to fund operations, planned capital expenditures, debt service and various strategic investments in our business. Cash flow from operations is used to make planned capital investments in our business, to pursue acquisitions that meet our corporate objectives, to pay dividends, and to pay off debt and repurchase our shares at the discretion of our Board of Directors. Accumulated cash balances are invested in high-quality and marketable short term instruments. Our capital plan objectives are to support the Company operational needs and strategic plan for long term growth while maintaining a low cost of capital. Lines of credit are used in certain of our markets to fund settlement and as a source of working capital and, along with other bank financing, to fund acquisitions. We regularly evaluate our liquidity and capital position relative to cash requirements, and we may elect to raise additional funds in the future, either through the issuance of debt, equity or otherwise. At May 31, 2010, we had cash and cash equivalents totaling $769.9 million. Of this amount, we consider $268.1 million to be available cash, which generally excludes settlement related and merchant reserve cash balances. Settlement related cash balances represent surplus funds that we hold on behalf of our member sponsors when the incoming amount from the card networks precedes the member sponsors funding obligation to the merchant. Merchant reserve cash balances represent funds collected from our merchants that serve as collateral ( Merchant Reserves ) to minimize contingent liabilities associated with any losses that may occur under the merchant agreement. At May 31, 2010, our cash and cash equivalents included $199.4 million related to Merchant Reserves. While this cash is not restricted in its use, we believe that designating this cash to collateralize Merchant Reserves strengthens our fiduciary standing with our member sponsors and is in accordance with the guidelines set by the card networks. See Cash and cash equivalents and Settlement processing assets and obligations under Note 1 in the notes to the consolidated financial statements for additional details. Net cash provided by operating activities increased $82.8 million to $465.8 million for fiscal 2010 from the prior year. Income from continuing operations increased $16.0 million and we had cash provided by changes in working capital of $60.2 million. The working capital change was primarily due to the change in net settlement processing assets and obligations of $80.3 million and the change in accounts receivable of $13.4 million, partially offset by the change 35 Table of Contents Index to Financial Statements in prepaid expenses and other assets of $18.1 million. The change in net settlement processing assets and obligations is primarily due to timing differences, processed volume changes, exchange rate fluctuations and the reclassification of our Hong Kong settlement funding obligations as further described in Long-Term Debt and Credit Facilities below. The change in accounts receivable is primarily due the impact of our June 30, 2008 acquisition of 51% of HSBC Merchant Services LLP and increased revenues in the United States. The change in prepaid expenses and other assets is primarily due to prepaid income taxes. Net cash used in investing activities decreased $534.1 million to $25.2 million for fiscal 2010 from the prior year., During fiscal year 2009 we invested $438.6 million in a partnership with HSBC UK and acquired UCS and GPAP Phillipines for $75 million and $10.8 million, respectively. During fiscal year 2010 we had $29.5 million of cash investments in Auctionpay and other asset purchases. We also received net proceeds from the disposition of our money transfer business of $60.2 million (sales proceeds of $85.0 million less $24.8 million remaining in the business at closing) during fiscal year 2010. Capital expenditures increased to $56.1 million in fiscal 2010 from $40.9 million in fiscal 2009. These expenditures primarily relate to software and infrastructure. In fiscal 2010, we used $95.8 million in cash for financing activities. We used proceeds from our $300.0 million term loan to finance our $307.7 million acquisition of the remaining 49% interests in HSBC Merchant Services LLP which is reflected as a financing cash outflow because it has been recorded as an equity transaction, and therefore, as a reduction of redeemable noncontrolling interest. We also repaid $75.2 million in scheduled principal payment on notes payable and generated $69.0 million of cash from net borrowings on lines of credit. The fiscal 2010 net borrowings on lines of credit include the new facility with HSBC Hong Kong discussed above. Additionally, in fiscal 2010, we repurchased 2,382,890 shares of our common stock at a cost of $100.0 million. As of May 31, 2010, we paid $98.1 million in cash for such shares with the remaining $1.9 million paid in June 2010, and recorded in accounts payable and accrued liabilities. In fiscal 2009, we generated $161.5 million cash provided by financing activities due to proceeds from our $200 million term loan agreement. See Long-Term Debt and Credit Facilities below for a more detailed discussion of our borrowing activities. We believe that our current level of cash and borrowing capacity under our lines of credit described below, together with future cash flows from operations, are sufficient to meet the needs of our existing operations and planned requirements for the foreseeable future. During fiscal year 2011 we expect capital expenditures to approximate $85 million. We anticipate spending approximately $55 million in ongoing capital expenditures primarily for our global terminal replacement program and infrastructure investments, $12 million in start-up expenses related to a new Global Service Center in Manila, Philippines which will support customer and operational functions and $17 million for a new data center. 36 Table of Contents Index to Financial Statements Long-Term Debt and Credit Facilities Outstanding debt consisted of the following: May 31, 2010 May 31, 2009 (in thousands) Lines of credit: U.S. Credit Facility $ $ China Credit Facility Canada Credit Facility National Bank of Canada Credit Facility 1,534 Macau Credit Facility 1,454 1,333 Sri Lanka Credit Facility 2,382 1,355 Philippines Credit Facility 9,064 5,244 Maldives Credit Facility 2,501 708 Hong Kong Credit Facility 63,786 Total credit facilities 79,187 10,174 Notes Payable 10,064 12,003 Term loans 411,070 185,000 Total debt $ 500,321 $ 207,177 Current portion 227,356 39,567 Long-term debt 272,965 167,610 Total debt $ 500,321 $ 207,177 Maturity requirements on term loans and notes payable are as follows (in thousands): 2011 $ 148,169 2012 150,638 2013 120,425 2014 1,051 2015 851 Total $ 421,134 Lines of Credit Our line of credit facilities are used to provide a source of working capital and for general corporate purposes, while the United States Credit Facility is additionally available to fund future strategic acquisitions. Certain of our line of credit facilities allow us to fund merchants for credit and debit card transactions prior to receipt of corresponding settlement funds from Visa, MasterCard, and various other credit and debit card associations. Our line of credit facilities consist of the following: United States a five year, $350 million unsecured revolving credit facility agreement with a syndicate of banks based in the United States, which we refer to as our United States Credit Facility. The facility expires in November 2011, and borrowings bear a variable short term interest rate based on prime rate or London Interbank Offered Rate ( LIBOR ) plus a margin based on our leverage position. In addition, the United States Credit Facility allows us to expand the facility size to $700 million by requesting additional commitments from existing or new lenders. We plan to use the United States Credit Facility to fund future strategic acquisitions, to provide a source of working capital, and for general corporate purposes. As of May 31, 2010, the facility was undrawn. 37 Table of Contents Index to Financial Statements China a revolving credit facility with the People Bank of China for 17.5 million Chinese Renminbi to provide a source of working capital. This credit facility has a variable interest rate based on the lending rate stipulated by People Bank of China. As of May 31, 2010, the facility was undrawn. During the course of the annual review of this facility in June, 2010, we did not renew the facility. Canada a credit facility, which we refer to as our Canada Credit Facility, with the Canadian Imperial Bank of Commerce, or CIBC, as administrative agent and lender. The Canada Credit Facility is a facility which consists of a line of credit of $25 million Canadian dollars. In addition, the Canada Credit Facility allows us to expand the size of the uncommitted facility to $50 million Canadian dollars and does not have a fixed term. This credit facility carries no termination date, but can be terminated by either party with advance notice. This credit facility has various card association receivables and CIBC settlement related bank accounts as pledged collateral in the case of default, This credit facility has a variable interest rate based on the Canadian dollar London Interbank Offered Rate plus a margin. As of May 31, 2010 the facility was undrawn. National Bank of Canada a credit facility for up to $80 million Canadian dollars and $5 million United States dollars to provide certain Canadian merchants with same day value for their Canadian and United States dollar MasterCard credit card transactions and debit card transactions. This credit facility has a variable short term interest rate plus a margin. As of May 31, 2010 the facility was undrawn. Macau a revolving overdraft facility with HSBC Asia Pacific, for 40.0 million Macau Pataca to fund merchants prior to receipt of corresponding settlement funds from the card associations. This has a variable interest rate based on the lending rate stipulated by HSBC Asia Pacific, less a margin. As of May 31, 2010 the interest rate on the facility was 2.5%. This facility is subject to annual review. Sri Lanka a revolving overdraft facility with HSBC Bank, Sri Lanka, for 650.0 million Sri Lankan Rupees in two tranches: one to fund merchants prior to receipt of corresponding settlement funds from the card associations and the other for general corporate purposes. The facility has a variable short term interest rate plus a margin. As of May 31, 2010 the interest rates on the two tranches of the facility was 11.4% and 12.4%. This facility is subject to annual review. Philippines a revolving facility with HSBC Bank, Philippines, for up to 350 million Pesos and $1.5 million United States dollars to fund merchants prior to receipt of corresponding settlement funds from the card associations. The facility has variable short term interest rates plus a margin. As of May 31, 2010 the interest rates on the facility was 4.5% and 0.8%, respectively. This facility is subject to annual review. Maldives a revolving overdraft facility with HSBC Bank, Maldives, for up to $4.0 million to fund merchants prior to receipt of corresponding settlement funds from the card associations. This facility is denominated in United States dollars and has a variable short term interest rate plus a margin. As of May 31, 2010 the interest rate on the facility was 4.9%. This facility is subject to annual review. Hong Kong a revolving overdraft facility entered into with HSBC Limited Hong Kong effective April 1, 2010, for up to HKD 800 million to fund merchants prior to receipt of corresponding settlement funds from the card associations. This facility is denominated in Hong Kong dollars and has a variable short term interest rate plus a margin. As of May 31, 2010 the interest rate on the facility was 0.7%. This facility is subject to annual review. Prior to entering into this facility HSBC funded all Hong Kong merchant payments pursuant to our marketing alliance agreement. Accordingly, the associated funding obligation was included in settlement processing obligations on our consolidated balance sheets. From the effective date of this facility, this funding obligation is included in lines of credit on our consolidated balance sheets. Term Loans On June 23, 2008, we entered into a five year unsecured $200.0 million term loan agreement with a syndicate of banks in the United States to partially fund our HSBC Merchant Services LLP acquisition. The term 38 Table of Contents Index to Financial Statements loan bears interest, at our election, at the prime rate or LIBOR, plus a margin based on our leverage position. As of May 31, 2010 and 2009, the interest rate on the term loan was 1.4%. The term loan calls for quarterly principal payments of $5.0 million beginning with the quarter ended August 31, 2008 and increasing to $10.0 million beginning with the quarter ending August 31, 2010 and $15.0 million beginning with the quarter ending August 31, 2011. As of May 31, 2010, the outstanding balance of the term loan was $165.0 million. The $5.0 million quarterly principal payment scheduled for May 31, 2010 was paid on June 1, 2010, as the contractual payment due date fell on a holiday. On July 10, 2009, we entered into a $300.0 million term loan agreement ($230.0 million and 43.5 million) with a syndicate of financial institutions. We used the proceeds of this term loan to pay down our then existing credit facility which had been used to initially fund the purchase of the remaining 49% interest in the LLP. This term loan matures in 2012 and has a variable interest rate based on the LIBOR plus a margin based on our leverage position. As of May 31, 2010 the interest rates on the term loan tranches were 3.3% and 3.7%, respectively. The term loan calls for quarterly principal payments of 5% beginning with the quarter ended August 31, 2009 and increasing to 7.5% beginning with the quarter ending August 31, 2010. As of May 31, 2010, the outstanding balance of the term loan was $246.1 million. The $11.5 million quarterly principal payment on the United States tranche scheduled for May 31, 2010 was paid on June 1, 2010, as the contractual payment due date fell on a holiday. Notes Payable In connection with our acquisition of UCS, we assumed notes payable with a total outstanding balance of approximately $10.1 million at May 31, 2010. These notes are used to fund the purchase of ATMs and have interest rates ranging from 8% to 10.5% with maturity dates ranging from March 2011 through July 2015. Redeemable Noncontrolling Interest We have a redeemable noncontrolling interest associated with our Asia-Pacific merchant services business channel. Global Payments Asia-Pacific, Limited, or GPAP, is the entity through which we conduct our merchant acquiring business in the Asia-Pacific region. We own 56% of GPAP and HSBC Asia Pacific owns the remaining 44%. The GPAP shareholders agreement includes provisions pursuant to which HSBC Asia Pacific may compel us to purchase, at the lesser of fair value or a net revenue multiple, additional GPAP shares from HSBC Asia Pacific (the Put Option ). HSBC Asia Pacific may exercise the Put Option on the fifth anniversary of the closing of the acquisition (July 2011) and on each anniversary thereafter. By exercising the Put Option, HSBC Asia Pacific can require us to purchase, on an annual basis, up to 15% of the total issued shares of GPAP. We estimate the maximum total redemption amount of the redeemable noncontrolling interest under the Put Option would be $102.7 million as of May 31, 2010. We have adjusted our redeemable noncontrolling interest to reflect the maximum redemption amount as of May 31, 2010 on our consolidated balance sheet. Off-Balance Sheet Arrangements We have not entered into any transactions with unconsolidated entities whereby we have financial guarantees, subordinated retained interest, derivative instruments, or other contingent arrangements that expose us to material continuing risks, contingent liabilities, or other obligations under a variable interest in an unconsolidated entity that provides us with financing, liquidity, market, or credit risk support other than the guarantee products described under Critical Accounting Estimates below. BIN/ICA Agreements In connection with our acquisition of merchant credit card operations of banks, we have entered into sponsorship or depository and processing agreements with certain of the banks. These agreements allow us to use 39 Table of Contents Index to Financial Statements the banks identification numbers, referred to as Bank Identification Number for Visa transactions and Interbank Card Association number for MasterCard transactions, to clear credit card transactions through Visa and MasterCard. Certain of such agreements contain financial covenants, and we were in compliance with all such covenants as of May 31, 2010. On June 18, 2010, CIBC provided notice that they will not renew the sponsorship for Visa in Canada after the initial ten year term. As a result, our Canadian Visa sponsorship will expire in March 2011. We are pursuing alternatives to CIBC sponsorship, including filing an application with the Canadian regulatory authorities for the formation of a wholly owned loan company in Canada which could serve as our financial institution sponsor and negotiating with other financial institutions. The failure to establish a wholly owned loan company that can serve as our Visa sponsor in Canada or to secure a new sponsorship relationship with another financial institution that would replace the arrangement that we currently have with CIBC would likely result in the loss of merchant customers and lead to a material reduction in our revenues and earnings. Commitments and Contractual Obligations The following table summarizes our contractual obligations and commitments as of May 31, 2010: Payments Due by Future Period Total Less than 1 Year 1-3 Years 3-5 Years 5+ Years (in thousands) Operating leases (Note 14) $ 20,133 $ 9,856 $ 6,341 $ 2,508 $ 1,428 Long-term debt including current portion (Note 6) 421,134 148,169 271,063 1,902 Interest on long-term debt (1) 18,383 10,782 7,411 189 (1) Interest on variable rate debt is based on rates effective as of May 31, 2010. Note: This table excludes other obligations that we may have, such as employee benefit plan obligations, unrecognized tax benefits, and other current and long term liabilities reflected in our consolidated balance sheet and the redeemable noncontrolling interest put option rights described above. At this time, we are unable to make a reasonably reliable estimate of the timing of these payments; therefore such amounts are not included in the above contractual obligation table. We do not have any material purchase commitments as of May 31, 2010. Critical Accounting Estimates In applying the accounting policies that we use to prepare our consolidated financial statements, we necessarily make accounting estimates that affect our reported amounts of assets, liabilities, revenues and expenses. Some of these accounting estimates require us to make assumptions about matters that are highly uncertain at the time we make the accounting estimates. We base these assumptions and the resulting estimates on historical information and other factors that we believe to be reasonable under the circumstances, and we evaluate these assumptions and estimates on an ongoing basis. In many instances, however, we reasonably could have used different accounting estimates and, in other instances, changes in our accounting estimates could occur from period to period, with the result in each case being a material change in the financial statement presentation of our financial condition or results of operations. We refer to accounting estimates of this type as critical accounting estimates. The critical accounting estimates that we discuss below are those that we believe are most important to an understanding of our consolidated financial statements. Accounting estimates necessarily require subjective determinations about future events and conditions. Therefore, the following descriptions of critical accounting estimates are forward-looking statements, and actual results could differ materially from the results anticipated by these forward-looking statements. You should read the following in conjunction with Note 1 of the notes to consolidated financial statements and the risk factors contained in Item 1A Risk Factors of this annual report. 40 Table of Contents Index to Financial Statements Reserve for operating losses As a part of our direct merchant credit card and debit card processing services and check guarantee services in the United States, Canada, the United Kingdom, Asia-Pacific, and the Russian Federation we experience merchant losses and check guarantee losses, which we collectively refer to as operating losses. Merchant losses occur when we are unable to collect amounts from merchant customers for any charges properly reversed by the cardholder. Check guarantee losses occur when we are unable to collect the full amount of a guaranteed check from the checkwriter. Please refer to the notes to consolidated financial statements for a further explanation of these operating losses. We process credit card transactions for direct merchants and recognize revenue based on a percentage of the gross amount charged. Our direct merchant customers have the liability for any charges properly reversed by the cardholder. In the event, however, that we are not able to collect such amount from the merchants, due to merchant fraud, insolvency, bankruptcy or any other reason, we may be liable for any such reversed charges. We require cash deposits, guarantees, letters of credit and other types of collateral by certain merchants to minimize any such contingent liability, and we also utilize a number of systems and procedures to manage merchant risk. We have, however, historically experienced losses due to merchant defaults. We account for our potential liability relating to merchant losses as guarantees. We estimate the fair value of these guarantees by adding a fair value margin to our estimate of losses. This estimate of losses is comprised of known losses and a projection of future losses based on an assumed percentage of our United States, Canadian, the United Kingdom, Asia-Pacific, and the Russian Federation direct merchant credit card and signature debit card sales volumes processed, or processed volume. For the years ended May 31, 2010, 2009, and 2008, our processed volume was $237.5 billion, $231.9 billion, and $134.7 billion, respectively. For these same periods, we recorded provisions for merchant losses of $9.6 million, $7.1 million, and $5.7 million, respectively. As a percentage of processed volume, these charges were 0.0040%, 0.0031%, and 0.0043%, respectively, during the above periods. For these same years, we experienced actual losses of $7.3 million, $6.9 million, and $5.2 million, respectively. Since actual losses were similar to the merchant loss provisions provided above, we believe that our estimation process has been materially accurate on a historical basis. A 10% increase or decrease in our provision for merchant losses as a percentage of processed volume for the year ended May 31, 2010 would have resulted in a decrease or increase in net income of $0.7 million. Further, if our provision for merchant losses as a percentage of processed volume for our fiscal 2010 had equaled our provision for merchant losses as a percentage of processed volume of 0.0031% for the same prior year period, our net income would have increased by $1.7 million. As of May 31, 2010 and 2009, $5.8 million and $3.5 million, respectively, have been recorded for guarantees associated with merchant card processing and are included in settlement processing obligations in the accompanying consolidated balance sheets. In our check guarantee service offering, we charge our merchants a percentage of the gross amount of the check and guarantee payment of the check to the merchant in the event the check is not honored by the checkwriter bank. We have the right to collect the full amount of the check from the checkwriter but have not historically recovered 100% of the guaranteed checks. Our check guarantee loss reserve is also comprised of known losses and a projection of future losses based on an assumed percentage of the face value of our guaranteed checks. For the years ended May 31, 2010, 2009, and 2008, we guaranteed total check face values of $2.5 billion, $2.5 billion, and $2.7 billion, respectively. For those same periods, we recorded provisions for check guarantee losses of $14.9 million, $17.9 million, and $23.9 million, respectively. As a percentage of the total guaranteed check face value, these charges were 0.61%, 0.73%, and 0.90%, respectively, during the years mentioned above. For these same years, we experienced actual losses of $14.8 million, $17.9 million, and $23.0 million, respectively. Since actual losses were similar to the check guarantee loss provisions provided above, we believe that our estimation process has been materially accurate on a historical basis. A 10% increase or decrease in our percentage assumption for the year ended May 31, 2010 would have resulted in a decrease or increase in net income of $1.1 million. Further, if our guarantee loss as a percentage of guarantee volume for our fiscal 2010 had equaled our guarantee loss as a percentage of guarantee 41 Table of Contents Index to Financial Statements volume of 0.73% for the same prior year period, our net income would have decrease by $2.2 million. As of May 31, 2010 and 2009, we had a check guarantee reserve of $4.2 million and $4.0 million, respectively, which is included in claims receivable, net, in the accompanying consolidated balance sheets. We derive our projected loss rate assumptions primarily based on a rolling six month analysis of historic loss activity. These assumptions, however, bear the risk of change, which may occur as a result of several qualitative factors. For merchant losses, these factors include the following: a change in the creditworthiness of our merchant customers; a change in the levels of credit card fraud affecting our merchant customers; and a change in the effectiveness of our internal credit, risk management, and collection departments. For check guarantee losses, these factors include a change in the levels of dishonored consumer checks presented to our guarantee service merchant customers and a change in the effectiveness of our internal check guarantee procedures, customer acceptance and retention policies, or collection protocols. Application of our percentage assumptions involve uncertainty regarding changes in any of the factors above, especially those that are outside of our control, such as the financial health of the United States, Canadian, the United Kingdom, Asia-Pacific, and the Russian Federation regional economies at a regional or national level and the related impact on our customers. Goodwill and long-lived asset valuations We regularly evaluate whether events and circumstances have occurred that indicate the carrying amounts of goodwill, property and equipment, and other intangible assets may warrant revision or may not be recoverable. Goodwill and other indefinite-life intangible assets are evaluated for impairment annually by applying a fair value based test. Property and equipment and finite-lived intangible assets are evaluated for impairment when facts and circumstances indicate the carrying value of such assets may exceed their fair values. When factors indicate that these assets should be evaluated for possible impairment, we assess the potential impairment of their carrying values by determining whether the carrying value of such long-lived assets will be recovered through the future undiscounted cash flows expected from use of the asset and its eventual disposition. We completed our most recent annual goodwill and indefinite-life intangible asset impairment test as of January 1, 2010. Recoverability of goodwill is measured at the reporting unit level and consists of two steps. In the first step the reporting unit carrying amount, including goodwill, is compared to its fair value which is measured based upon, among other factors, a discounted cash flow analysis as well as market multiples for comparable companies. If the carrying amount of the reporting unit is greater than its fair value, goodwill is considered impaired and step two must be performed. Step two measures the impairment loss by comparing the implied fair value of reporting unit goodwill with the carrying amount of that goodwill. The implied fair value of goodwill is determined by allocating the fair value of the reporting unit to all the assets and liabilities of that unit (including unrecognized intangibles) as if the reporting unit had been acquired in a business combination. The excess of fair value over the amounts allocated to the assets and liabilities of the reporting unit is the implied fair value of goodwill. The excess of the carrying amount over the implied fair value is the impairment loss. At May 31, 2010 we had goodwill of $569.1 million recorded in our consolidated balance sheet. We completed our most recent annual goodwill and indefinite-life intangible asset impairment test on January 1, 2010 and determined that no impairment charges were required as of that date. Other intangible assets primarily represent customer-related intangible assets (such as customer lists and merchant contracts), contract-based intangible assets (such as non-compete agreements, referral agreements and processing rights), and trademarks associated with acquisitions. Customer-related intangible assets, contract-based intangible assets and certain trademarks are amortized over their estimated useful lives of up to 30 years. The useful lives for customer-related intangible assets are determined based primarily on forecasted cash flows, which include estimates for the revenues, expenses, and customer attrition associated with the assets. The useful lives of contract-based intangible assets are equal to the terms of the agreements. The useful lives of amortizable trademarks are based on our plans to phase out the trademarks in the applicable markets. 42 Table of Contents Index to Financial Statements We use the accelerated method of amortization for our customer related intangible assets. In determining amortization expense under our accelerated method for any given period, we calculate the expected cash flows for that period that were used in determining the acquired value of the asset and divide that amount by the expected total cash flows over the estimated life of the asset. We multiply that percentage by the initial carrying value of the asset to arrive at the amortization expense for that period. In addition, if the cash flow patterns that we experience are less favorable than our initial estimates, we will adjust the amortization schedule accordingly. These cash flow patterns are derived using certain assumptions and cost allocations due to a significant amount of asset interdependencies that exist in our business. During fiscal 2010, we did not adjust the amortization schedules. We believe that our accelerated method better approximates the distribution of cash flows generated by our acquired customer relationships. We use the straight-line method of amortization for our contract-based intangibles and amortizable trademarks. Capitalization of Internally Developed Software We develop software that is used in providing processing services to customers. Capitalization of internally developed software, primarily associated with operating platforms, occurs when we have completed the preliminary project stage, management authorizes the project, management commits to funding the project, it is probable the project will be completed and the project will be used to perform the function intended. The preliminary project stage consists of the conceptual formulation of alternatives, the evaluation of alternatives, the determination of existence of needed technology and the final selection of alternatives. Costs incurred prior to the preliminary project stage are expensed as incurred. Currently unforeseen circumstances in software development could require us to implement alternative plans with respect to a particular effort, which could result in the impairment of previously capitalized software development costs. Costs capitalized during fiscal 2010, 2009 and 2008 totaled $17.6 million, $11.8 million and $10.2 million, respectively. Internally developed software has an amortization period of 5 to 10 years. Internally developed software assets are placed into service when they are ready for their intended use. During fiscal 2010, we placed into service $54.9 million of hardware and software costs associated with our next generation technology processing platform, referred to as G2. This platform is planned to be a new front-end operating environment for our merchant processing in the United States, Asia-Pacific, the United Kingdom, and Canada, and is intended to replace a number of legacy platforms that have higher cost structures. Depreciation and amortization associated with these costs is calculated based on transactions expected to be processed over the life of the platform. We believe that this method is more representative of the platform use than the straight-line method. We are currently processing transactions on our G2 platform in seven markets in our Asia-Pacific region and we have begun the process of supporting the United States. As these markets represent a small percentage of our overall transactions, depreciation and amortization related to our G2 platform for fiscal 2010 was not significant. Depreciation and amortization expense will increase as we complete migrations of other markets to the G2 platform. Income Taxes The determination of our provision for income taxes requires management judgment in the use of estimates and the interpretation and application of complex tax laws. Judgment is also required in assessing the timing and amounts of deductible and taxable items. We believe our tax return positions are fully supportable; however, we establish liabilities for material tax exposures relating to deductions, transactions and other matters involving some uncertainty as to the proper tax treatment of the item. Issues raised by a tax authority may be finally resolved at an amount different than the related liability. When facts and circumstances change (including a resolution of an issue or statute of limitations expiration), these liabilities are adjusted through the provision for income taxes in the period of change. 43 Table of Contents Index to Financial Statements Judgment will be required to determine whether or not some portion or all of our deferred tax assets will not be realized. To the extent we determine that we will not realize the benefit of some or all of our deferred tax assets, then these deferred tax assets will be adjusted through our provision for income taxes in the period in which this determination is made. At May 31, 2010 our consolidated balance sheet includes net deferred tax assets associated with our UK business of $87.5 million. Our assessment of the recoverability of these deferred tax assets is based, in part, on our projections of future business performance. If future business performance fails to meet projections, we may determine that some or all of these deferred tax assets will not be realized. In the event of such a determination, we would record a valuation allowance for the amount deemed unrecoverable with a corresponding charge to the provision for income taxes. 44 Table of Contents Index to Financial Statements
