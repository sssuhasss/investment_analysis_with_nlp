Item 7. Management Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations Overview TripAdvisor is the world largest online travel company. Our mission is to help people around the world plan and have the perfect trip by giving them access to the reviews and opinions of the millions of travelers who make up our global online community. TripAdvisor aggregates reviews and opinions about destinations, accommodations (including hotels, B&Bs, specialty lodging and vacation rentals), restaurants and activities throughout the world. Our platform also enables consumers to book hotels, vacation rentals, airline tickets, vacation packages, destination services and even cruises. Our branded websites include tripadvisor.com in the United States and localized versions of the website in 33 other countries, including China under the brand daodao.com. Our TripAdvisor-branded websites globally reached more than 260 million monthly unique visitors during the year ended December 31, 2013, according to Google Analytics. We feature over 125 million reviews and opinions on more than 775,000 hotels and accommodations and approximately 550,000 vacation rentals as well as more than 2 million restaurants and 400,000 attractions in 139,000 destinations throughout the world. Beyond travel-related content, our websites also include links to the websites of our customers, including travel advertisers, allowing travelers to directly book their travel arrangements. In addition to the flagship TripAdvisor brand, we now manage and operate 20 other travel media brands, connected by the common goal of providing comprehensive travel planning resources across the travel sector. Executive Summary At present, our financial results are principally dependent on our ability to grow click-based advertising revenue. We continue to invest in areas of potential click-based revenue growth, including international and mobile initiatives, while also investing in our Display-based advertising, Business Listings and Vacation Rentals businesses. We aim to leverage our position as the largest online travel company to become an increasingly important partner for advertisers including hoteliers, online travel agencies and other travel-related service providers by providing our customers with access to a large audience of highly-qualified, highly-engaged users. The key drivers of our click-based and display-based advertising revenue are described below, as well as a summary of our key growth areas and the current trends impacting our business. Key Drivers of Click-Based Advertising Revenue For the years ended December 31, 2013, 2012 and 2011, 74%, 77% and 79%, respectively, of our total revenue came from our core CPC-based lead generation product. The key drivers of our click-based advertising revenue include the growth in monthly unique hotel shoppers and revenue per hotel shopper. Hotel shoppers: Total traffic growth, or growth in monthly visits from unique visitors, is reflective of our overall brand growth. We track and analyze sub-segments of traffic and their correlation to revenue generation and utilize hotel shoppers as an indicator of revenue growth. We use the term hotel shoppers to refer to users who view a listing of hotels in a city or visitors who view a specific hotel page. Hotel shoppers tend to be seasonal and also tend to vary based on general economic conditions. Our number of hotel shoppers increased 36% for the year ended December 31, 2013 over 2012 and increased 32% for the year ended December 31, 2012 over 2011, according to our log files. Revenue per hotel shopper: Revenue per hotel shopper is a metric we use to analyze how effectively we are able to monetize hotel shoppers based on a combination of user conversion and pricing. User conversion is a measure of how many hotel shoppers ultimately click on a CPC link that generates revenue for us. User conversion on our site is primarily driven by three factors: merchandising, commerce coverage and choice. We define merchandising as the number and location of ads that are available on a page; we define commerce coverage as whether we have a client who can take an online booking for a particular property; and we define choice as the number of clients available for any given 39 Table of Contents property, allowing the user to shop for the best price. Pricing is the effective CPC that online travel agencies and hoteliers are willing to pay us for a hotel shopper lead. Revenue per hotel shopper decreased 13% for the year ended December 31, 2013 in comparison to 2012, and decreased 8% for the year ended December 31, 2012 in comparison to 2011, according to our log files. In summary, our CPC revenue depends on the number of hotel shoppers that are interested in a property, whether there is a commerce link available for that hotel shopper to click on for that property, whether there are several commerce choices available for that property so the hotel shopper has the benefit of pricing and availability from multiple sources and what our customers are willing to pay us for the lead. Key Drivers of Display-Based Advertising Revenue For the years ended December 31, 2013, 2012 and 2011, 13%, 12% and 13%, respectively, of our total revenue came from our display-based advertising product. The key drivers of our display-based advertising revenue include the growth in number of impressions, or the number of times an ad is displayed on our site, and the cost per thousand impressions, or CPM. Our number of impressions sold increased 34% for the year ended December 31, 2013 over 2012 and increased 6% for the year ended December 31, 2012 over 2011, while pricing decreased 5% for the year ended December 31, 2013 over 2012 and increased 1% for the years ended December 31, 2012 over 2011, according to our customer logs. Key Growth Areas We continue to invest in areas of potential growth, including our social, mobile and global initiatives as well as our Business Listings and Vacation Rentals products. Mobile . Mobile is an investment area that is geared towards creating a more complete user experience by reinforcing the TripAdvisor brand when users are in-market. In the year ended December 31, 2013, we saw strong mobile user uptake, as aggregate downloads of our TripAdvisor, City Guides, SeatGuru, Jetsetter and GateGuru mobile apps reached 82 million downloads and average monthly unique visitors via smartphone and tablet devices grew over 170% year-over-year from 32 million to 87 million, according to company logs. We believe that travelers will increasingly use mobile devices, including smartphones and tablets, to conduct travel research and planning. Social . Our Wisdom of Friends initiative is a core component of our strategic growth plan. We believe that having a strong social presence improves engagement on our sites and improves the sites stickiness amongst the users. As a result, we continue to deepen our integration with Facebook. As of December 31, 2013, and according to AppData, an independent application tracking traffic service, TripAdvisor has averaged over 36 million monthly Facebook users via its TripAdvisor Facebook application. We offer these Facebook users a more personalized and social travel planning experience that enables travelers to engage with their own Facebook friends reviews and opinions when planning their perfect trip on TripAdvisor. Business Listings . Created in early 2010, our Business Listings product enables hotel and accommodation owners to list pertinent property information on TripAdvisor, bringing them closer to potential customers and thereby increasing direct bookings. In the year ended December 31, 2013, we grew our Business Listings customer base over 38% to 69,000 subscribers, representing approximately 9% of our current hotel and accommodation listings on TripAdvisor branded sites. We continue to expand our sales force and improve features to grow our subscriber base. Vacation Rentals . As of December 31, 2013, we had amassed an inventory of approximately 550,000 properties, up more than 80% during the year, across our TripAdvisor Vacation Rentals, U.S.-based FlipKey, and European-based Holiday Lettings and Niumba. We offer individual property owners and property managers the ability to list using a subscription-based fee structure or a free-to-list, commission-based option and we believe our highly-engaged and motivated user community creates a competitive advantage for us in this market. 40 Table of Contents Current Trends Affecting Our Business Increasing Competition. The travel review industry and, more generally, the business of collecting and aggregating travel-related resources and information, continue to be increasingly competitive. In recent years, an increasing number of companies, such as search companies Google, Inc. and Baidu.com, Inc. and several large online travel agencies, have begun to collect and aggregate travel information and resources. We plan to continue to invest in order to remain the leading source of travel reviews as well as continuing to enhance our content and user experience. Refer to our discussion above in Competition in Item 1 Business section for additional information on our competition. Increasing Use of Internet and Social Media to Access Travel Information. Commerce, information and advertising continue to migrate to the Internet and away from traditional media outlets. We believe that this trend will continue to create strategic growth opportunities, allowing us to attract new consumers and develop unique and effective advertising solutions. Consumers are increasingly using online social media channels, such as Facebook and Twitter, as a means to communicate and exchange information, including travel information and opinions. We have made significant efforts related to social networking in order to leverage the expanding use of this channel and enhance traffic diversification and user engagement. We are also continually adapting our user experience in response to a changing Internet environment and usage trends. For example, in 2012, we invested in building and introducing to users hotel metasearch functionality for our smartphone platforms and in 2013, we completed the process of implementing hotel metasearch functionality on our desktop and tablet platforms. Refer to our metasearch discussion above under Improving the Hotel Shopper Experience in the Our Strategy section in Item 1 Business for additional information on our hotel metasearch transition. Increasing Mobile Usage. Users are increasingly using smartphone and tablet computing devices to access the Internet. To address these growing user demands, we continue to extend our platform to develop smartphone and tablet applications to deliver travel information and resources. Although the substantial majority of our smartphone users also access and engage with our websites on personal computers and tablets where we display advertising, our users could decide to access our products primarily through smartphone devices. We have just begun to display graphic advertising on smartphones, however, our smartphone monetization strategies are still developing, as smartphone monetization was less than 20% of desktop monetization of hotel shoppers during the year ended December 31, 2013 while tablets monetize more closely to desktops. Mobile growth and development remains a key strategy and we will continue to invest and innovate in this growing platform to help us maintain and grow our user base, engagement and monetization over the long term. Click-Based Advertising Revenue. In recent years, the majority of our revenue growth resulted from higher click-based advertising revenue due to increased traffic on our websites and an increase in the volume of clicks on our advertisers placements. Although click-based advertising revenue growth has generally been driven by traffic volume, we remain focused on the various factors that could impact revenue growth, including, but not limited to, the growth in hotel shoppers, CPC pricing fluctuations, the overall economy, the ability of advertisers to monetize our traffic, the quality and mix of traffic to our websites, and the quality and mix of traffic from our advertising placements to advertisers, as well as advertisers evolving approach to transaction attribution models and return on investment targets. We monitor and regularly respond to changes in these factors in order to strategically improve our user experience, customer satisfaction and monetization in this dynamic environment. For example, in order to improve user experience, we introduced metasearch functionality to our hotel shoppers as discussed above under Improving the Hotel Shopper Experience in the Our Strategy section in Item 1 Business. Spin-Off During 2011, Expedia, Inc., or Expedia, announced its plan to separate into two independent public companies in order to better achieve certain strategic objectives of its various businesses. We refer to this transaction as the Spin-Off. On December 20, 2011, following the close of trading on the NASDAQ Global Select Market ( NASDAQ ), the Spin-Off was completed, and TripAdvisor began trading as an independent 41 Table of Contents public company on December 21, 2011. Expedia effected the Spin-Off by means of a reclassification of its capital stock that resulted in the holders of Expedia capital stock immediately prior to the time of effectiveness of the reclassification having the right to receive a proportionate amount of TripAdvisor capital stock. In connection with the Spin-Off, Expedia contributed or transferred all of the subsidiaries and assets relating to Expedia TripAdvisor Media Group to TripAdvisor and TripAdvisor assumed all of the liabilities relating to Expedia TripAdvisor Media Group. For purposes of governing certain of the ongoing relationships between us and Expedia at and after the Spin-Off, and to provide for an orderly transition, we and Expedia have entered into various agreements, including, among others, the Separation Agreement, the Tax Sharing Agreement, the Employee Matters Agreement and Transition Services Agreement, and commercial agreements. The full texts of the Separation Agreement, the Tax Sharing Agreement, the Employee Matters Agreement and the Transition Services Agreement are incorporated by reference in this Annual Report on Form 10-K as Exhibits 2.1, 10.2, 10.3 and 10.4. TripAdvisor has satisfied its obligations under the Separation Agreement, the Employee Matters Agreement and the Transition Services Agreement. TripAdvisor continues to be subject to certain post-spin obligations under the Tax Sharing Agreement. Segment We have one operating and reportable segment. The segment is determined based on how our chief operating decision maker manages our business, makes operating decisions, evaluates operating performance and allocates resources. The chief operating decision maker for the company is our Chief Executive Officer. 42 Table of Contents Results of Operations Selected Financial Data (in thousands, except per share data) Year ended December 31, % Change 2013 2012 2011 2013 vs. 2012 2012 vs. 2011 Revenue $ 727,236 $ 559,215 $ 426,045 30 % 31 % Revenue from Expedia 217,425 203,751 211,018 7 % (3 )% Total revenue 944,661 762,966 637,063 24 % 20 % Costs and expenses: Cost of revenue (exclusive of amortization) (1) 17,714 12,074 10,873 47 % 11 % Selling and marketing (2) 368,353 266,239 209,176 38 % 27 % Technology and content (2) 130,673 86,640 57,448 51 % 51 % General and administrative (2) 98,121 75,641 44,770 30 % 69 % Depreciation 29,495 19,966 18,362 48 % 9 % Amortization of intangible assets 5,731 6,110 7,523 (6 )% (19 )% Shared services fee with Expedia 9,222 % (100 )% Spin-off costs 6,932 % (100 )% Total costs and expenses 650,087 466,670 364,306 39 % 28 % Operating income 294,574 296,296 272,757 (1 )% 9 % Other income (expense): Interest income 1,738 510 808 241 % (37 )% Interest expense (10,074 ) (11,381 ) (417 ) (11 )% 2,629 % Other, net (1,536 ) (3,450 ) (1,254 ) (55 )% 175 % Total other expense, net (9,872 ) (14,321 ) (863 ) (31 )% 1,559 % Income before income taxes 284,702 281,975 271,894 1 % 4 % Provision for income taxes (79,259 ) (87,387 ) (94,103 ) (9 )% (7 )% Net income 205,443 194,588 177,791 6 % 9 % Net (income) loss attributable to noncontrolling interest (519 ) (114 ) (100 )% 355 % Net income attributable to TripAdvisor, Inc. $ 205,443 $ 194,069 $ 177,677 6 % 9 % Earnings per share attributable to TripAdvisor, Inc : Basic $ 1.44 $ 1.39 $ 1.33 4 % 5 % Diluted $ 1.41 $ 1.37 $ 1.32 3 % 4 % Weighted average common shares outstanding: Basic 142,854 139,462 133,461 2 % 4 % Diluted 145,263 141,341 134,865 3 % 5 % Other financial data: Adjusted EBITDA (3) $ 378,753 $ 352,474 $ 322,918 7 % 9 % (1) Excludes amortization as follows: Amortization of acquired technology included in amortization of intangibles $ 949 $ 708 $ 578 Amortization of website development costs included in depreciation 19,602 12,816 12,438 $ 20,551 $ 13,524 $ 13,016 (2) Includes stock-based compensation as follows: Selling and marketing $ 10,643 $ 4,622 $ 3,216 Technology and content 21,053 11,400 3,931 General and administrative 17,257 14,080 10,197 (3) See Adjusted EBITDA discussion below for more information and for a reconciliation of Adjusted EBITDA to net income, the most directly comparable financial measure calculated and presented in accordance with GAAP. 43 Table of Contents Adjusted EBITDA To provide investors with additional information regarding our financial results, we have disclosed Adjusted EBITDA in this Annual Report on Form 10-K, a non-GAAP financial measure. We have provided reconciliations below of Adjusted EBITDA to net income, the most directly comparable GAAP financial measure. A non-GAAP financial measure refers to a numerical measure of a company historical or future financial performance, financial position, or cash flows that excludes (or includes) amounts that are included in (or excluded from) the most directly comparable measure calculated and presented in accordance with GAAP in such company financial statements. We define Adjusted EBITDA as net income (loss) plus: (1) provision for income taxes; (2) other (income) expense, net; (3) depreciation of property and equipment, including internal use software and website development; (4) amortization of intangible assets; (5) stock-based compensation; and (6) non-recurring expenses. Adjusted EBITDA is the primary metric by which management evaluates the performance of its business and on which internal budgets are based. In particular, the exclusion of certain expenses in calculating Adjusted EBITDA facilitates operating performance comparisons on a period-to-period basis. Adjusted EBITDA eliminates items that are either not part of our core operations, such as non-recurring expenses, or those costs that do not require a cash outlay, such as stock-based compensation. Adjusted EBITDA also excludes depreciation and amortization expense, which is based on our estimates of the useful life of tangible and intangible assets. These estimates could vary from actual performance of the asset, are based on historical costs and other factors and may not be indicative of current or future capital expenditures. We believe that by excluding certain items, such as stock-based compensation and non-recurring expenses, Adjusted EBITDA corresponds more closely to the cash that operating income generated from our business and allows investors to gain an understanding of the factors and trends affecting the ongoing cash earnings capabilities of our business, from which capital investments are made and debt is serviced. Our use of Adjusted EBITDA has limitations as an analytical tool, and you should not consider it in isolation or as a substitute for analysis of our results reported in accordance with GAAP. Some of these limitations are: Adjusted EBITDA does not reflect our cash expenditures or future requirements for capital expenditures or contractual commitments; Adjusted EBITDA does not reflect changes in, or cash requirements for, our working capital needs; Adjusted EBITDA does not consider the potentially dilutive impact of stock-based compensation; Although depreciation and amortization are non-cash charges, the assets being depreciated and amortized may have to be replaced in the future, and Adjusted EBITDA does not reflect cash capital expenditure requirements for such replacements or for new capital expenditure requirements; Adjusted EBITDA does not reflect tax payments that may represent a reduction in cash available to us; and Other companies, including companies in our own industry, may calculate Adjusted EBITDA differently than we do, limiting its usefulness as a comparative measure. Because of these limitations, you should consider Adjusted EBITDA alongside other financial performance measures, including various cash flow metrics, net income and our other GAAP results. 44 Table of Contents The following table is a reconciliation of Adjusted EBITDA to net income, the most directly comparable financial measure calculated and presented in accordance with GAAP, for the periods presented: Year ended December 31, 2013 2012 2011 (in thousands) Adjusted EBITDA $ 378,753 $ 352,474 $ 322,918 Depreciation (1) (29,495 ) (19,966 ) (18,362 ) Amortization of intangible assets (5,731 ) (6,110 ) (7,523 ) Stock-based compensation (48,953 ) (30,102 ) (17,344 ) Spin-off costs (6,932 ) Other expense, net (9,872 ) (14,321 ) (863 ) Provision for income taxes (79,259 ) (87,387 ) (94,103 ) Net income 205,443 194,588 177,791 (1) Includes amortization of internal use software and website development costs. Reclassifications Certain reclassifications have been made to conform the prior period data to the current format. These reclassifications had no net effect on our consolidated and combined financial statements and were not material. Revenue We derive substantially all of our revenue through the sale of advertising, primarily through click-based advertising and, to a lesser extent, display-based advertising. In addition, we earn revenue through a combination of subscription-based offerings related to our Business Listings and Vacation Rentals products, transaction revenue from selling room nights on our transactional sites, and other revenue including content licensing. Year ended December 31, % Change 2013 2012 2011 2013 vs. 2012 2012 vs. 2011 (in millions) Click-based advertising $ 696 $ 588 $ 500 18 % 18 % Display-based advertising 119 94 86 26 % 10 % Subscription, transaction and other 130 81 51 60 % 58 % Total revenue $ 945 $ 763 $ 637 24 % 20 % 2013 vs. 2012 Revenue increased $182 million during the year ended December 31, 2013 when compared to the same period in 2012, primarily due to an increase in click-based advertising revenue of $108 million. The primary driver of the increase in click-based advertising revenue was an increase in hotel shoppers of 36% for the year ended December 31, 2013, partially offset by lower revenue per hotel shopper of 13% for the year ended December 31, 2013, primarily due to a combination of lower user conversion related to our transition to hotel metasearch, growth in hotel shoppers on smartphones, which have a lower monetization rate than desktops and tablets, and growth in emerging international markets that are currently monetizing at lower levels than our mature markets. Display-based advertising increased by $25 million during the year ended December 31, 2013, primarily as a result of a 34% increase in the number of impressions sold due to increased sales productivity coupled with our new Delayed Ad Call product, and worldwide growth particularly in emerging markets when compared to the same period in 2012, partially offset by a decrease in pricing by 5% for the year ended December 31, 2013. Subscription, transaction and other revenue increased by $49 million during the year ended December 31, 2013, primarily due to growth in our Business Listings and Vacation Rentals products. 45 Table of Contents 2012 vs. 2011 Revenue increased $126 million during the year ended December 31, 2012 when compared to the same period in 2011, primarily due to an increase in click-based advertising revenue of $88 million. The primary driver of the increase in click-based advertising revenue was an increase in hotel shoppers during the year ended December 31, 2012, when compared to the same period for 2011, of 32%, partially offset by lower revenue per hotel shopper of 8% for the year ended December 31, 2012, primarily due to lower clicks per hotel shopper due to our site redesign in September 2011. Display-based advertising increased by $8 million during the year ended December 31, 2012, primarily as a result of a 6% increase in the number of impressions sold when compared to the same period in 2011, and an increase in pricing by 1% for the year ended December 31, 2012. Subscription, transaction and other revenue increased by $30 million during the year ended December 31, 2012, primarily due to growth in our Business Listings and Vacation Rentals products. The following table presents our revenue by geographic region, which reflects how we measure our business internally. Revenue by geography is based on the location of our websites: Year ended December 31, % Change 2013 2012 2011 2013 vs. 2012 2012 vs. 2011 ($ in millions) North America (1) $ 494 $ 409 $ 360 21 % 13 % EMEA (2) 291 240 218 21 % 10 % APAC (3) 122 82 46 49 % 80 % LATAM (4) 38 32 13 20 % 137 % Total revenue $ 945 $ 763 $ 637 24 % 20 % (1) United States and Canada* (2) Europe, Middle East and Africa (3) Asia-Pacific (4) Latin America * Included in international revenue for discussion purposes. International revenue increased $105 million and $88 million during the years ended December 31, 2013 and 2012, respectively, compared to the same periods in 2012 and 2011. International revenue represented 51%, 49%, and 45% of total revenue during the years ended December 31, 2013, 2012, and 2011, respectively. The increase in international revenue, in absolute dollars and as a percentage of total revenue, is primarily due to additional investment in international expansion and growth in international hotel shoppers. In addition to the above product revenue discussion, Revenue from Expedia, which consists primarily of click-based advertising, is as follows: Year ended December 31, % Change 2013 2012 2011 2013 vs. 2012 2012 vs. 2011 ($ in millions) Revenue from Expedia $ 217 $ 204 $ 211 7 % (3 )% % of revenue 23.0 % 26.7 % 33.1 % 2013 vs. 2012 Revenue from Expedia increased $13 million during the year ended December 31, 2013, respectively, when compared to the same period in 2012, primarily due to lower click volume sent to Expedia, primarily related to our transition to hotel metasearch which was more than offset by higher CPC pricing paid by Expedia during this time period. For information on our relationship with Expedia refer to Note 15 Related Party Transactions in the notes to our consolidated and combined financial statements. 46 Table of Contents 2012 vs. 2011 Revenue from Expedia decreased $7 million during the year ended December 31, 2012 when compared to the same period in 2011, primarily due to lower CPC pricing paid by Expedia, partially offset by higher click volume sent to Expedia in 2012.

We also incurred increased professional service fees primarily related to legal and tax initiatives. In addition, in connection with the Spin-Off, we assumed Expedia obligation to fund a charitable foundation (see Note 12 Commitments and Contingencies in the notes to the consolidated and combined financial statements). Our expense related to the funding of this charitable foundation was $7 million for the year ended December 31, 2012. Shared Services Fee with Expedia Prior to the Spin-Off, our shared services fee was comprised of allocations from Expedia for accounting, legal, tax, corporate development, treasury, financial reporting, real estate management and included an allocation of employee compensation within these functions. These allocations were determined based on what we and Expedia considered to be reasonable reflections of the utilization of services provided or the benefit received by us.

The increase in interest income is primarily due to the fact that we began investing in marketable securities during the fourth quarter of 2012. Refer to Note 4 Financial Instruments for additional information on our current portfolio as of December 31, 2013. 2012 vs. 2011 Interest income did not materially change during the year ended December 31, 2012 when compared to the same period in 2011. Interest Expense Interest expense primarily consists of interest incurred, commitment fees and debt issuance cost amortization related to our Credit Agreement and Chinese Credit Facilities. Year ended December 31, % Change 2013 2012 2011 2013 vs. 2012 2012 vs. 2011 ($ in millions) Interest expense $ 10 $ 11 $ (11 )% 2,629 % % of revenue 1.1 % 1.5 % 0.1 % 2013 vs. 2012 The decrease in interest expense is primarily due to the lower outstanding borrowings and effective interest rates during the year ended December 31, 2013 over the same period during 2012 related to our Term Loan. Refer to Note 8 Debt for additional information on our outstanding borrowing facilities. 2012 vs. 2011 The increase in interest expense is related to interest incurred as a result of us entering into our Credit Agreement for the year ending December 31, 2012 over the same period during 2011.

Provision for Income Taxes Year ended December 31, % Change 2013 2012 2011 2013 vs. 2012 2012 vs. 2011 ($ in millions) Provision for income taxes $ 79 $ 87 $ 94 (9 )% (7 )% Effective tax rate 27.8 % 31.0 % 34.6 % 51 Table of Contents 2013 vs. 2012 Our effective tax rates for the years ended December 31, 2013 and 2012 were 27.8% and 31.0%, respectively. Our effective tax rate is less than the federal statutory rate primarily due to earnings in jurisdictions outside the United States, where our effective tax rate is lower. This is partly driven by the current statutory tax rate of 23% in the United Kingdom and our tax incentive on qualifying income in Singapore granted by the Singapore Economic Development Board in 2011. Our effective tax rate is partially offset by state income taxes, non-deductible stock compensation and accruals on uncertain tax positions. The decrease in the effective tax rate for 2013 compared to the 2012 rate was primarily due to an increase in earnings in jurisdictions outside the United States as well as an internal restructuring that occurred during the fourth quarter of 2012. This restructuring was undertaken within our non-U.S. operations to align our global structure for more efficient treasury management and global cash deployment. During the third quarter of 2013, Massachusetts enacted a statute that changed how sales are apportioned from being a cost of performance measure to market based sourcing. The impact of such will decrease our overall state tax provision in 2014. Additionally, the United Kingdom statutory tax rate is set to decrease from 23% to 21% effective April 1, 2014, which will also reduce our effective tax rate. 2012 vs. 2011 Our effective tax rate was lower than the 35% federal statutory rate primarily due to earnings in jurisdictions outside the United States, where our effective tax rate is lower, which was partially offset by state income taxes and accruals on uncertain tax positions. The change in the effective rate for 2012 compared to the 2011 rate was primarily due to an increase in earnings in jurisdictions outside the United States and a decrease in state income taxes, as well as the internal restructuring. Liquidity and Capital Resources The following section explains how we have generated and used our cash historically, describes our current capital resources and discusses our future financial commitments. Cash Requirements The following table aggregates our material contractual obligations and minimum commercial commitments as of December 31, 2013: By Period Total Less than 1 year 1 to 3 years 3 to 5 years More than 5 years (in millions) Term Loan (1) $ 340 $ 40 $ 300 $ $ Expected interest payments on Term Loan (1) 14 5 9 Chinese credit facilities (1) 28 28 Operating leases 86 13 19 16 38 Build to suit lease obligation (2) 144 10 19 115 Purchase obligations (3) 1 1 Total (4)(5)(6) $ 613 $ 87 $ 338 $ 35 $ 153 (1) The amounts included as expected interest payments on the Term Loan in this table are based on the current effective interest rate and payment terms as of December 31, 2013, but, could change significantly in the 52 Table of Contents future. Amounts assume that our existing debt is repaid at maturity and do not assume additional borrowings or refinancings of existing debt. See Note 8 Debt in the notes to the consolidated and combined financial statements for additional information on our Term Loan and Chinese Credit Facilities. (2) Estimated future minimum rental payments for our future corporate headquarters in Needham, MA. See discussion under Office Lease Commitments below. (3) Excludes amounts already recorded on the consolidated balance sheet at December 31, 2013. (4) Excluded from the table was $38 million of unrecognized tax benefits, including interest and penalties, that we have recorded in other long-term liabilities for which we cannot make a reasonably reliable estimate of the amount and period of payment. We estimate that none of these amounts will be paid within the next twelve months. (5) In connection with the Spin-Off, we assumed Expedia obligation to fund a charitable foundation. The Board of Directors of the charitable foundation is currently comprised of Stephen Kaufer- President and Chief Executive Officer, Julie M.B. Bradley-Chief Financial Officer and Seth J. Kalvert- Senior Vice President, General Counsel and Secretary. Our obligation was calculated at 2.0% of OIBA in 2013. For a discussion regarding OIBA see Note 16 Segment Information in the notes to the consolidated and combined financial statements. This future commitment has been excluded from the table above. (6) Excludes spending on anticipated leasehold improvements on our Needham, Massachusetts lease, including design, development, construction costs, and the purchase and installation of equipment, net of related Landlord incentives, which we estimate will begin in the fourth quarter of 2014 thru the second quarter of 2015 and currently estimate will cost in the range of $35-$40 million. Term Loan Facility Due 2016 and Revolving Credit Facility On December 20, 2011, in connection with the Spin-Off, we entered into the Credit Agreement, which provides $600 million of borrowing including: the Term Loan Facility, or Term Loan, in an aggregate principal amount of $400 million with a term of five years due December 2016; and the Revolving Credit Facility in an aggregate principal amount of $200 million available in U.S. dollars, Euros and British pound sterling with a term of five years expiring December 2016. The Term Loan and any loans under the Revolving Credit Facility bear interest by reference to a base rate or a Eurocurrency rate, in either case plus an applicable margin based on our leverage ratio. We are also required to pay a quarterly commitment fee, on the average daily unused portion of the Revolving Credit Facility for each fiscal quarter and fees in connection with the issuance of letters of credit. The Term Loan and loans under the Revolving Credit Facility currently bear interest at LIBOR plus 150 basis points, or the Eurocurrency Spread, or the alternate base rate ( ABR ) plus 50 basis points, and undrawn amounts are currently subject to a commitment fee of 22.5 basis points. As of December 31, 2013 we are using a one-month interest period Eurocurrency Spread which is approximately 1.7% per annum. Interest is currently payable on a monthly basis while we are borrowing under the one-month interest rate period. The current interest rates are based on current assumptions, leverage and LIBOR rates and do not take into account that rates will reset periodically. A 25 basis point change in the interest rate on the current Term Loan balance would result in an increase or decrease to interest expense of approximately $0.9 million per annum. The Revolving Credit Facility includes $40 million of borrowing capacity available for letters of credit and $40 million for borrowings on same-day notice. As of December 31, 2013 there are no outstanding borrowings under our Revolving Credit Facility. Prepayments We may voluntarily repay any outstanding borrowing under the Credit Agreement at any time without premium or penalty, other than customary breakage costs with respect to Eurocurrency loans. 53 Table of Contents Guarantees All obligations under the Credit Agreement are unconditionally guaranteed by us and each of our existing and subsequently acquired or organized direct or indirect wholly-owned domestic and foreign restricted subsidiaries, subject to certain exceptions for controlled foreign corporations, foreign subsidiaries where applicable law would otherwise be violated or non-material subsidiaries. Covenants The Credit Agreement contains a number of covenants that, among other things, restrict our ability to: incur additional indebtedness, create liens, enter into sale and leaseback transactions, engage in mergers or consolidations, sell or transfer assets, pay dividends and distributions or repurchase our capital stock, make investments, loans or advances, prepay certain subordinated indebtedness, make certain acquisitions, engage in certain transactions with affiliates, amend material agreements governing certain subordinated indebtedness, and change our fiscal year. The Credit Agreement also requires us to maintain a maximum leverage ratio and a minimum cash interest coverage ratio, and contains certain customary affirmative covenants and events of default, including a change of control. If an event of default occurs, the lenders under the Credit Agreement will be entitled to take various actions, including the acceleration of all amounts due under Credit Agreement and all actions permitted to be taken by a secured creditor. As of December 31, 2013 we believe we are in compliance with all of our debt covenants. Chinese Credit Facilities In addition to our borrowings under the Credit Agreement, we maintain our Chinese Credit Facilities. As of December 31, 2013 and 2012, we had $28.5 million and $32.1 million of short term borrowings outstanding, respectively. Certain of our Chinese subsidiaries entered into a RMB 138,600,000 (approximately $22 million), one-year revolving credit facility with Bank of America (the Chinese Credit Facility BOA ) that is currently subject to review on a periodic basis with no specific expiration period. During the year ended December 31, 2012, this credit line was increased to RMB 189,000,000 (approximately $30 million). During the year ended December 31, 2013, we made a payment inclusive of interest of RMB 68,283,570 (approximately $10.9 million). We currently have $12.7 million of outstanding borrowings from this credit facility as of December 31, 2013. Our Chinese Credit Facility BOA currently bears interest based at 100% of the People Bank of China base rate and was 5.6% as of December 31, 2013. In addition, during April 2012, certain of our Chinese subsidiaries entered into a RMB 125,000,000 (approximately $20 million) one-year revolving credit facility with J.P. Morgan Chase Bank ( Chinese Credit Facility-JPM ). This credit facility was renewed for an additional year in April 2013. During the year ended December 31, 2013, we made a payment inclusive of interest of RMB 24,281,546 (approximately $3.9 million). We currently have $15.8 million of outstanding borrowings from this credit facility as of December 31, 2013. Our Chinese Credit Facility JPM currently bears interest based at 100% of the People Bank of China base rate and was 5.6% as of December 31, 2013. Office Lease Commitments We currently lease approximately 119,000 square feet for our corporate headquarters in Newton, Massachusetts, pursuant to a lease with an expiration date of April 2015. We also lease an aggregate of approximately 382,000 square feet at approximately 30 other locations across North America, Europe and Asia Pacific, primarily for our international management teams, sales offices, and subsidiary headquarters, pursuant to leases with expiration dates through December 2030. We currently have no equipment leases as of December 31, 2013. 54 Table of Contents In June 2013, TripAdvisor LLC ( TA LLC ), our indirect, wholly owned subsidiary, entered into a lease (the Lease ), for a new corporate headquarters. Pursuant to the Lease, the landlord will build an approximately 280,000 square foot rental building in Needham, Massachusetts (the Premises ), and thereafter lease the Premises to TA LLC as TripAdvisor new corporate headquarters for an initial term of 15 years and 7 months. If the landlord fails to deliver the Premises according to the schedule, subject to certain conditions, TA LLC may be entitled to additional free rent, or in extreme cases, a right to terminate the Lease. Under the Lease, TA LLC is required to pay an initial base rent of $33.00 per square foot per year, increasing to $34.50 per square foot by the final year of the initial term, as well as all real estate taxes and other building operating costs. TA LLC also has an option to extend the term of the Lease for two consecutive terms of five years each. The aggregate future minimum lease payments are $143.5 million and are currently scheduled to be paid, beginning in November 2015, as follows: $1.1 million for 2015, $9.3 million for 2016, $9.3 million for 2017, $9.3 million for 2018 and $114.6 million for 2019 and thereafter. The Lease has escalating rental payments and initial periods of free rent. TA LLC was also obligated to deliver a letter of credit to the Landlord in the amount of $0.8 million as security deposit, which amount is subject to increase under certain circumstances. TA LLC also has an option to extend the term of the Lease for two consecutive terms of five years each. In connection with the Lease, TripAdvisor entered into a Guaranty (the Guaranty ), pursuant to which TripAdvisor provides full payment and performance guaranty for all of TA LLC obligations under the Lease. We have concluded we are the deemed owner (for accounting purposes only) of the Premises during the construction period under GAAP build to suit lease accounting. As building construction began in the fourth quarter of 2013, we recorded estimated project construction costs incurred by the landlord as an asset and a corresponding long term liability in Property and equipment, net and Other long-term liabilities, respectively, on our consolidated balance sheets. We will increase the asset and corresponding long term liability as additional building costs are incurred by the landlord during the construction period. Once the landlord completes the construction of the Premises (estimated to be May 2015), we will evaluate the Lease in order to determine whether or not the Lease meets the criteria for sale-leaseback treatment. If the Lease meets the sale-leaseback criteria, we will remove the asset and the related liability from its consolidated balance sheet and treat the Lease as either an operating or capital lease based on the our assessment of the accounting guidance. If the Lease does not meet sale-leaseback criteria, we will treat the Lease as a financing obligation and lease payments will be attributed to (1) a reduction of the principal financing obligation; (2) imputed interest expense; and (3) land lease expense (which is considered an operating lease) representing an imputed cost to lease the underlying land of the facility. In addition, the underlying building asset will be depreciated over the building estimated useful life. And at the conclusion of the lease term, we would de-recognize both the net book values of the asset and financing obligation. Although we will not begin making lease payments pursuant to the Lease until November 2015, the portion of the lease obligations allocated to the land is treated for accounting purposes as an operating lease that commenced in 2013. Purchase Obligations These amounts represent minimum non-cancelable purchase obligations with certain of our vendors, which we expect to utilize in the ordinary course of business. Letters of Credit As of December 31, 2013, we have issued unused letters of credit totaling $1 million, related to our property leases. 55 Table of Contents Sources and Uses of Cash Our cash flows from operating, investing and financing activities, as reflected in the consolidated and combined statements of cash flows, are summarized in the following table: Year ended December 31, 2013 2012 2011 (in millions) Net cash provided by (used in): Operating activities $ 350 $ 239 $ 218 Investing activities $ (197 ) $ (244 ) $ (539 ) Financing activities $ (170 ) $ 190 $ 412 Our principal source of liquidity is cash flows generated from operations, although liquidity needs can also be met through drawdowns under our credit facilities discussed above. As of December 31, 2013 and 2012, we had $671 million and $586 million of cash, cash equivalents and short and long-term available-for-sale marketable securities. As of December 31, 2013 approximately $442 million of our cash, cash equivalents and short and long-term marketable securities are held by our international subsidiaries, primarily in the United Kingdom, and are related to earnings we intend to reinvest permanently outside the United States. Cumulative undistributed earnings of foreign subsidiaries that we intend to indefinitely reinvest outside of the United States totaled approximately $481 million as of December 31, 2013. Should we distribute, or be treated under certain U.S. tax rules as having distributed, the earnings of foreign subsidiaries in the form of dividends or otherwise, we may be subject to U.S. income taxes. Determination of the amount of any unrecognized deferred income tax liability on this temporary difference is not practicable because of the complexities of the hypothetical calculation. Cash held is primarily denominated in U.S. dollars. Historically, the cash we generate has been sufficient to fund our working capital requirements, capital expenditures and to meet our long term debt obligations and other financial commitments. Management believes that our cash and cash equivalents and available for sale marketable securities, combined with expected cash flows generated by operating activities and available cash from our credit facilities will be sufficient to fund our ongoing working capital requirements, capital expenditures, business growth initiatives, meet our long term debt obligations and other financial commitments, fund our new corporate lease obligations, share repurchases and fund any potential acquisitions for at least the next twelve months. However, if during that period or thereafter, we are not successful in generating sufficient cash flow from operations or in raising additional capital when required in sufficient amounts and on terms acceptable to us, we may be required to reduce our planned capital expenditures and scale back the scope of our business growth initiatives, either of which could have a material adverse effect on our future financial condition or results of operations. 2013 vs. 2012 Operating Activities For the year ended December 31, 2013, net cash provided by operating activities increased by $111 million or 46% when compared to the same period in 2012, primarily due to an increase in net income of $11 million and an increase in non-cash items not affecting cash flows of $35 million, which is primarily related to increased stock based compensation and depreciation. Working capital movements increased $64 million for the year ended December 31, 2013 when compared to the same period in 2012, primarily due to an increase in operating cashflow from deferred merchant payables of $18 million and lower income tax payments primarily due to a lower effective tax rate with the remaining increase related to the timing of customer receipts, cash receipts from Expedia, income tax payments, and vendor payments. Investing Activities For the year ended December 31, 2013, net cash provided by investing activities increased by $47 million when compared to the same period in 2012, primarily due to the sale and maturity of marketable securities of 56 Table of Contents $326 million in 2013. This was primarily offset by an increase in the purchases of marketable securities by $213 million, cash paid for 2013 business acquisitions of $35 million, net of cash acquired, and an increase in capital expenditures of $26 million. In addition, we received $7 million during the three months ended March 31, 2012 from Expedia related to Spin-Off, which did not reoccur in 2013. Financing Activities For the year ended December 31, 2013, net cash provided by financing activities decreased by $360 million when compared to the same period in 2012 primarily due to an increase of $20 million in principal payments on our Term Loan, payments of $145 million for common stock share repurchases under our authorized share repurchase program, a reduction of $207 million in proceeds related to the exercise of our stock options and warrants, primarily due to one-time warrant proceeds of $215 million during 2012 and the introduction in Q3 2013 of the net share settlement of our stock option exercises, and a $15 million repayment of our outstanding borrowings on our Chinese Credit Facilities in 2013. This was offset by a $10 million repayment of our outstanding borrowing on our Revolving Credit Facility in 2012 that did not reoccur in 2013 and $22 million paid to purchase the remaining shares of our non-controlling interest in 2012 that did not reoccur in 2013. 2012 vs. 2011 Operating Activities For the year ended December 31, 2012, net cash provided by operating activities increased by $21 million or 10% when compared to the same period in 2011, primarily due to an increase in net income of $17 million and an increase in non-cash items not affecting cash flows of $9 million, which is primarily related to increased stock based compensation, offset by a decrease in working capital movements of $5 million. The decrease in working capital movements in 2012 vs. 2011 was primarily driven by the classification of activity with Expedia of $17 million which was classified in operating activities in 2012, as compared to investing activities in the periods prior to the Spin-Off, offset by the timing of customer cash receipts and the timing of tax and vendor payments. Investing Activities For the year ended December 31, 2012, net cash provided by investing activities increased by $295 million when compared to the same period in 2011, primarily due to the cessation of net cash transfers to Expedia related to business operations in the periods prior to the Spin-Off in 2011 of $96 million and a distribution of approximately $406 million to Expedia immediately prior to the Spin-Off in 2011. This was primarily offset by the purchase of $219 million of marketable securities in 2012, as we began purchasing debt securities in the fourth quarter of 2012. Financing Activities For the year ended December 31, 2012, net cash provided by financing activities decreased by $222 million when compared to the same period in 2011 primarily due to funding related to our term loan facility borrowing in conjunction with the Spin-Off of $400 million in 2011. This was offset by proceeds from the exercise of our stock options and warrants of $231 million, net of payment of minimum withholding taxes related to the settlement of equity awards of $7 million in 2012. In addition we paid $20 million in principal payments on our Term Loan, a $10 million repayment of our outstanding borrowing on our Revolving Credit Facility, and paid $22 million to purchase the remaining shares of our noncontrolling interest in 2012. Off-Balance Sheet Arrangements As of December 31, 2013, we did not have any off-balance sheet arrangements, as defined in Item 303(a)(4)(ii) of Regulation S-K of the SEC, that have, or are reasonably likely to have, a current or future effect on our financial condition, results of operations, liquidity, capital expenditures or capital resources. 57 Table of Contents Contingencies Legal Proceedings In the ordinary course of business, we and our subsidiaries are parties to legal proceedings and claims involving alleged infringement of third-party intellectual property rights, defamation, and other claims. Rules of the SEC require the description of material pending legal proceedings, other than ordinary, routine litigation incident to the registrant business, and advise that proceedings ordinarily need not be described if they primarily involve damages claims for amounts (exclusive of interest and costs) not individually exceeding 10% of the current assets of the registrant and its subsidiaries on a consolidated basis. In the judgment of management, none of the pending litigation matters that the Company and its subsidiaries are defending involves or is likely to involve amounts of that magnitude. There may be claims or actions pending or threatened against us of which we are currently not aware and the ultimate disposition of which could have a material adverse effect on us. Related Party Transactions For information on our relationships with Expedia and Liberty Interactive Corporation refer to Note 15 Related Party Transactions in the notes to our consolidated and combined financial statements. Critical Accounting Policies and Estimates Critical accounting policies and estimates are those that we believe are important in the preparation of our consolidated and combined financial statements because they require that management use judgment and estimates in applying those policies. We prepare our consolidated and combined financial statements and accompanying notes in accordance with GAAP. Preparation of the consolidated and combined financial statements and accompanying notes requires that management make estimates and assumptions that affect the reported amounts of assets and liabilities and the disclosure of contingent assets and liabilities as of the date of the consolidated and combined financial statements as well as revenue and expenses during the periods reported. Management bases its estimates on historical experience, where applicable, and other assumptions that it believes are reasonable under the circumstances. Actual results may differ from estimates under different assumptions or conditions. There are certain critical estimates that we believe require significant judgment in the preparation of the consolidated and combined financial statements. We consider an accounting estimate to be critical if: It requires us to make an assumption because information was not available at the time or it included matters that were highly uncertain at the time management was making the estimate; and/or Changes in the estimate or different estimates that management could have selected may have had a material impact on our financial condition or results of operations. Our significant accounting policies and estimates are more fully described in Note 2 Significant Accounting Policies in the notes to our consolidated and combined financial statements. A discussion of information about the nature and rationale for our critical accounting estimates is below. Business Combination Valuations and Recoverability of Goodwill, Indefinite and Definite-Lived Intangible Assets Goodwill . We account for acquired businesses using the purchase method of accounting which requires that the assets acquired and liabilities assumed be recorded at the date of acquisition at their respective fair values. Any excess of the purchase price over the estimated fair values of the net assets acquired is recorded as goodwill. We assess goodwill, which is not amortized, for impairment annually as of October 1, or more frequently, if events and circumstances indicate impairment may have occurred. We test goodwill for impairment 58 Table of Contents at the reporting unit level (operating segment or one level below an operating segment). We have one operating and reportable segment. The segment is determined based on how our chief operating decision maker manages our business, makes operating decisions and evaluates operating performance. In the evaluation of goodwill for impairment, we first perform a qualitative assessment to determine whether it is more likely than not that the fair value of the reporting unit is less than the carrying amount. If we determine that it is not more likely than not that the fair value of goodwill is less than its carrying amount, no further testing is necessary. If, however, we determine that it is more likely than not that the fair value of goodwill is less than its carrying amount, we then perform a quantitative assessment and compare the fair value of the reporting unit to the carrying value. If the carrying value of a reporting unit exceeds its fair value, the goodwill of that reporting unit is potentially impaired and we proceed to step two of the impairment analysis. In step two of the analysis, we will record an impairment loss equal to the excess of the carrying value of the reporting unit goodwill over its implied fair value should such a circumstance arise. Indefinite-Lived Intangible Assets . Intangible assets that have indefinite lives are not amortized and are tested for impairment annually on October 1, or whenever events or changes in circumstances indicate that the carrying value may not be recoverable. Similar to the qualitative assessment for goodwill, we may assess qualitative factors to determine if it is more likely than not that the fair value of the indefinite-lived intangible asset is less than its carrying amount. If we determine that it is not more likely than not that the fair value of the indefinite-lived intangible asset is less than its carrying amount, no further testing is necessary. If, however, we determine that it is more likely than not that the fair value of the indefinite-lived intangible asset is less than its carrying amount, we compare the fair value of the indefinite-lived asset with its carrying amount. If the carrying value of an individual indefinite-lived intangible asset exceeds its fair value, the individual asset is written down by an amount equal to such excess. The assessment of qualitative factors is optional and at our discretion. We may bypass the qualitative assessment for any indefinite-lived intangible asset in any period and resume performing the qualitative assessment in any subsequent period. As part of our qualitative assessment for our 2013 impairment analysis, the factors that we considered for our goodwill and indefinite-lived intangible assets included, but were not limited to: (a) changes in macroeconomic conditions in the overall economy and the specific markets in which we operate, (b) our ability to access capital, (c) changes in the online travel industry, (d) changes in the level of competition, (e) comparison of our current financial performance to historical and budgeted results, (f) changes in excess market capitalization over book value based on our current common stock price and latest consolidated balance sheet, and (g) comparison of the excess of the fair value of our of trade names and trademarks to the carrying value of those same assets, using the results of our most recent quantitative assessment. After considering these factors and the impact that changes in such factors would have on the inputs used in our previous quantitative assessment, we determined for our goodwill and indefinite-lived intangible assets that it was more likely than not that these assets were not impaired. Therefore no impairment charges were recognized to our consolidated statement of operations during the year ended December 31, 2013 for our goodwill or indefinite-lived intangible assets. Since the annual impairment tests in October 2013, there have been no events or changes in circumstances to indicate any potential impairment and our goodwill and indefinite lived intangibles are not currently considered at risk. In the event that future circumstances indicate that any portion of our goodwill or our indefinite-lived intangibles is impaired, an impairment analysis would be performed. Definite-Lived Intangible Assets . Intangible assets with definite lives and other long-lived assets are carried at cost and are amortized on a straight-line basis over their estimated useful lives of two to eleven years. The straight-line method of amortization is currently used for our definite-lived intangible assets as it approximates, or is our best estimate, of the distribution of the economic use of our identifiable intangible assets. We review the carrying value of long-lived assets or asset groups, including property and equipment, to be used in operations whenever events or changes in circumstances indicate that the carrying amount of the assets might not be recoverable. 59 Table of Contents Factors that would necessitate an impairment assessment include a significant adverse change in the extent or manner in which an asset is used, a significant adverse change in legal factors or the business climate that could affect the value of the asset, or a significant decline in the observable market value of an asset, among others. If such facts indicate a potential impairment, we assess the recoverability of the asset by determining if the carrying value of the asset exceeds the sum of the projected undiscounted cash flows expected to result from the use and eventual disposition of the asset over the remaining economic life of the asset. If the recoverability test indicates that the carrying value of the asset is not recoverable, we will estimate the fair value of the asset using appropriate valuation methodologies which would typically include an estimate of discounted cash flows. Any impairment would be measured as the difference between the asset carrying amount and its estimated fair value. We have not identified any circumstances that would warrant an impairment assessment as of December 31, 2013. For additional information on our goodwill, indefinite-lived intangibles and definite-lived intangibles refer to Note 7 Goodwill and Intangible Assets, net in the notes to our consolidated and combined financial statements. Income Taxes We compute and account for our income taxes on a separate tax return basis. We record income taxes under the liability method. Deferred tax assets and liabilities reflect our estimation of the future tax consequences of temporary differences between the carrying amounts of assets and liabilities for book and tax purposes. We determine deferred income taxes based on the differences in accounting methods and timing between financial statement and income tax reporting. Accordingly, we determine the deferred tax asset or liability for each temporary difference based on the enacted tax rates expected to be in effect when we realize the underlying items of income and expense. We consider all relevant factors when assessing the likelihood of future realization of our deferred tax assets, including our recent earnings experience by jurisdiction, expectations of future taxable income and the carryforward periods available to us for tax reporting purposes, as well as assessing available tax planning strategies. We may establish a valuation allowance to reduce deferred tax assets to the amount we believe is more likely than not to be realized. Due to inherent complexities arising from the nature of our businesses, future changes in income tax law, tax sharing agreements or variances between our actual and anticipated operating results, we make certain judgments and estimates. Therefore, actual income taxes could materially vary from these estimates. We record liabilities to address uncertain tax positions we have taken in previously filed tax returns or that we expect to take in a future tax return. The determination for required liabilities is based upon an analysis of each individual tax position, taking into consideration whether it is more likely than not that our tax position, based on technical merits, will be sustained upon examination. For those positions for which we conclude it is more likely than not it will be sustained, we recognize the largest amount of tax benefit that is greater than 50% likely of being realized upon ultimate settlement with the taxing authority. The difference between the amount recognized and the total tax position is recorded as a liability. The ultimate resolution of these tax positions may be greater or less than the liabilities recorded. We have not provided for deferred U.S. income taxes on undistributed earnings of certain foreign subsidiaries that we intend to reinvest permanently outside the United States. Should we distribute earnings of foreign subsidiaries in the form of dividends or otherwise, we may be subject to U.S. income taxes. Due to complexities in tax laws and various assumptions that would have to be made, it is not practicable, at this time, to estimate the amount of unrecognized deferred U.S. taxes on these earnings. See Note 9 Income Taxes in the notes to our consolidated and combined financial statements for further information on income taxes. 60 Table of Contents Stock-Based Compensation Stock Options The exercise price for all stock options granted by us to date has been equal to the market price of the underlying shares of common stock at the date of grant. In this regard, when making stock option awards, our practice is to determine the applicable grant date and to specify that the exercise price shall be the closing price of our common stock on the date of grant. Stock options granted during the year ended December 31, 2013 had a term of ten years from the date of grant and generally vest over a four-year requisite service period. During the year ended December 31, 2013, we issued 2,824,583 of primarily service based stock options under the 2011 Incentive Plan with a weighted average grant-date fair value per option of $28.30. We will amortize the fair value, net of estimated forfeitures, as stock-based compensation expense over the vesting term on a straight-line basis, with the amount of compensation expense recognized at any date at least equaling the portion of the grant-date fair value of the award that is vested at that date. We use historical data to estimate pre-vesting option forfeitures and record share-based compensation expense only for those awards that are expected to vest. Changes in estimated forfeitures will be recognized through a cumulative catch-up adjustment in the period of change and will also impact the amount of stock compensation expense to be recognized in future periods. The estimated fair value of the options granted under the 2011 Incentive Plan to date, have been calculated using a Black-Scholes Merton option-pricing model ( Black-Scholes model ). The Black-Scholes model incorporates assumptions to value stock-based awards, which includes the risk-free rate of return, expected volatility, expected term and expected dividend yield. Our risk-free interest rate is based on the rates currently available on zero-coupon U.S. Treasury issues, in effect at the time of the grant, whose remaining maturity period most closely approximates the stock option expected term assumption. We estimate volatility of our common stock by using an average of our historical stock price volatility and of publicly traded companies that we consider peers based on daily price observations over a period equivalent to or approximate to the expected term of the stock option grants. The decision to use a weighted average volatility factor with our peer group was based upon the relatively short period of availability of data on our common stock. We estimate our expected term using the simplified method for all stock options as we do not have sufficient historical exercise data on our common stock. Our expected dividend yield is zero, as we have not paid any dividends on our common stock to date and do not expect to pay any cash dividends for the foreseeable future. Restricted Stock Units (RSUs) RSUs are stock awards that are granted to employees entitling the holder to shares of our common stock as the award vests. RSUs are measured at fair value based on the number of shares granted and the quoted price of our common stock at the date of grant. We amortize the fair value, net of estimated forfeitures, as stock-based compensation expense over the vesting term on a straight-line basis, with the amount of compensation expense recognized at any date at least equaling the portion of the grant-date fair value of the award that is vested at that date. Performance-based stock options and RSUs vest upon achievement of certain company-based performance conditions and a requisite service period. On the date of grant, the fair value of performance-based awards is determined, which is calculated using the same method as our service based stock options and RSUs described above. We then assess whether it is probable that the performance targets would be achieved. If assessed as probable, compensation expense will be recorded for these awards over the estimated performance period. At each reporting period, we will reassess the probability of achieving the performance targets and the performance period required to meet those targets. The estimation of whether the performance targets will be achieved and of the performance period required to achieve the targets requires judgment, and to the extent actual results or 61 Table of Contents updated estimates differ from our current estimates, the cumulative effect on current and prior periods of those changes will be recorded in the period estimates are revised, or the change in estimate will be applied prospectively depending on whether the change affects the estimate of total compensation cost to be recognized or merely affects the period over which compensation cost is to be recognized. The ultimate number of shares issued and the related compensation expense recognized will be based on a comparison of the final performance metrics to the specified targets. Estimates of fair value are not intended to predict actual future events or the value ultimately realized by employees who receive these awards, and subsequent events are not indicative of the reasonableness of our original estimates of fair value. We have considered many factors when estimating expected forfeitures, including our historical attrition rates, the employee class and historical experience. The estimate of stock awards that will ultimately be forfeited requires significant judgment and, to the extent that actual results or updated estimates differ from our current estimates, such amounts will be recorded as a cumulative adjustment in the period such estimates are revised.

Websites and Internal Use Software Development Costs We capitalize certain costs incurred during the application development stage related to the development of websites and internal use software when it is probable the project will be completed and the software will be used as intended. Such costs are amortized on a straight-line basis over the estimated useful life of the related asset, generally estimated to be three to five years. Capitalized costs include internal and external costs, if direct and incremental, and deemed by management to be significant. We expense costs related to the planning and post-implementation phases of software and website development as these costs are incurred. Maintenance and enhancement costs (including those costs in the post-implementation stages) are typically expensed as incurred, unless such costs relate to substantial upgrades and enhancements to the website or software resulting in added functionality, in which case the costs are capitalized. To the extent that we change the manner in which we develop and test new features and functionalities related to our websites and internal use software, assess the ongoing value of capitalized assets or determine the estimated useful lives over which the costs are amortized, the amount of website and internal use software development costs we capitalize and amortize could change in future periods. Refer to Note 6 Fixed Assets in the notes to our consolidated and combined financial statements for further information on our development of websites and internal use software.
