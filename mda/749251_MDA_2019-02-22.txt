ITEM 7. MANAGEMENT S DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS OF FINANCIAL CONDITION AND RESULTS OF OPERATIONS. The purpose of the following Management Discussion and Analysis ( MD&A ) is to facilitate an understanding of significant factors influencing the operating results, financial condition and cash flows of Gartner, Inc. Additionally, the MD&A conveys our expectations of the potential impact of known trends, events or uncertainties that may impact future results. You should read this discussion in conjunction with our consolidated financial statements and related notes included in this Annual Report on Form 10-K. Historical results and percentage relationships are not necessarily indicative of operating results for future periods. References to "Gartner," the "Company, we, our and us in this MD&A are to Gartner, Inc. and its consolidated subsidiaries. Business Divestitures During 2018, the Company divested all three of the non-core businesses that comprised its Other segment, each of which were acquired as part of the acquisition of CEB Inc. in April 2017. As a result of these divestitures and the movement of a small residual product in the Other segment into the Research business, the Company is no longer recording any additional operating activity in the Other segment effective September 1, 2018. Additional information regarding the divestitures is included in Note 2 Acquisitions and Divestitures in the Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements included in this Annual Report on Form 10-K. FORWARD-LOOKING STATEMENTS In addition to historical information, this Annual Report on Form 10-K contains certain forward-looking statements within the meaning of Section 27A of the Securities Act of 1933, as amended, and Section 21E of the Securities Exchange Act of 1934, as amended. Forward-looking statements are any statements other than statements of historical fact, including statements regarding our expectations, beliefs, hopes, intentions, projections, or strategies regarding the future. In some cases, forward-looking statements can be identified by the use of words such as may, will, expect, should, could, believe, plan, anticipate, estimate, predict, potential, continue or other words of similar meaning. We operate in a very competitive and rapidly changing environment that involves numerous risks and uncertainties, some of which are beyond our control. Additionally, our quarterly and annual revenues, operating income, and cash flows fluctuate as a result of many factors, including: the timing of our Symposium/ITxpo series that normally occurs during the fourth quarter, as well as our other conferences and meetings; the amount of new business generated, including from acquisitions; the mix of domestic and international business; domestic and international economic conditions; changes in market demand for our products and services; changes in foreign currency rates; the timing of the development, introduction and marketing of new products and services; competition in the industry; the payment of performance compensation; and other factors. The potential fluctuations in our operating income could cause period-to-period comparisons of operating results not to be meaningful and could provide an unreliable indication of future operating results. A description of the risk factors associated with our business is included under Risk Factors in Item 1A. of this Annual Report on Form 10-K, which is incorporated herein by reference. Forward-looking statements are subject to risks, estimates and uncertainties that could cause actual results to differ materially from those discussed in, or implied by, the forward-looking statements. Factors that might cause such a difference include, but are not limited to, those discussed in Risk Factors in Item 1A. of this Annual Report on Form 10-K. Readers should not place undue reliance on these forward-looking statements, which reflect management opinion only as of the date on which they were made.

We believe we have an unmatched combination of expert-led, practitioner-sourced and data-driven research that steers clients toward the right decisions on the issues that matter most. We re a trusted advisor and an objective resource for more than 15,000 organizations in more than 100 countries across all major functions, in every industry and enterprise size. Gartner is headquartered in Stamford, Connecticut, and as of December 31, 2018, we had more than 15,000 associates. Gartner currently delivers its products and services globally through three business segments: Research provides trusted, objective insights and advice on the mission-critical priorities of leaders across all functional areas of the enterprise through research and other reports, briefings, proprietary tools, access to our analysts and advisors, peer networking services and membership programs that enable our clients to make better decisions. Gartner's traditional strengths 19 in IT, marketing and supply chain research were enhanced in 2017 with Gartner's acquisition of CEB Inc., which added CEB's best practice and talent management research insights across a range of business functions, to include human resources, finance, sales and legal. Conferences (formerly called Events) provides business professionals across the organization the opportunity to learn, share and network. From our flagship CIO conference Gartner IT Symposium, to industry-leading conferences focused on specific business roles and topics, to member-driven sessions, our offerings enable attendees to experience the best of Gartner insight and advice live. Consulting provides customized solutions to unique client needs through on-site, day-to-day support, as well as proprietary tools for measuring and improving IT performance with a focus on cost, performance, efficiency and quality. BUSINESS MEASUREMENTS We believe that the following business measurements are important performance indicators for our business segments: BUSINESS SEGMENT BUSINESS MEASUREMENTS Research Total contract value represents the value attributable to all of our subscription-related contracts. It is calculated as the annualized value of all contracts in effect at a specific point in time, without regard to the duration of the contract. Total contract value primarily includes Research deliverables for which revenue is recognized on a ratable basis, as well as other deliverables (primarily Conferences tickets) for which revenue is recognized when the deliverable is utilized. Our total contract value consists of Global Technology Sales contract value , which includes sales to users and providers of technology, and Global Business Sales contract value , which includes sales to all other functional leaders. Client retention rate represents a measure of client satisfaction and renewed business relationships at a specific point in time. Client retention is calculated on a percentage basis by dividing our current clients, who were also clients a year ago, by all clients from a year ago. Client retention is calculated at an enterprise level, which represents a single company or customer. Wallet retention rate represents a measure of the amount of contract value we have retained with clients over a twelve-month period. Wallet retention is calculated on a percentage basis by dividing the contract value of clients, who were clients one year ago, by the total contract value from a year ago, excluding the impact of foreign currency exchange. When wallet retention exceeds client retention, it is an indication of retention of higher-spending clients, or increased spending by retained clients, or both. Wallet retention is calculated at an enterprise level, which represents a single company or customer. Conferences Number of destination conferences represents the total number of hosted destination conferences completed during the period. Single day, local meetings are excluded. Number of destination conferences attendees represents the total number of people who attend destination conferences. Single day, local meetings are excluded. Consulting Consulting backlog represents future revenue to be derived from in-process consulting and measurement engagements. Utilization rate represents a measure of productivity of our consultants. Utilization rates are calculated for billable headcount on a percentage basis by dividing total hours billed by total hours available to bill. Billing rate represents earned billable revenue divided by total billable hours. Average annualized revenue per billable headcount represents a measure of the revenue generating ability of an average billable consultant and is calculated periodically by multiplying the average billing rate per hour times the utilization percentage times the billable hours available for one year. 20 EXECUTIVE SUMMARY OF OPERATIONS AND FINANCIAL POSITION We have executed a consistent growth strategy since 2005 to drive revenue and earnings growth. The fundamentals of our strategy include a focus on creating extraordinary research insight, delivering innovative and highly differentiated product offerings, building a strong sales capability, providing world class client service with a focus on client engagement and retention, and continuously improving our operational effectiveness. We continue to focus on maximizing shareholder value. During 2018, we repurchased 2.1 million shares of our outstanding common stock, reduced the Company's outstanding debt by $1.0 billion, and divested all three of the non-core businesses that comprised the Company's Other segment, each of which were acquired as part of the acquisition of CEB Inc. ("CEB") in 2017. We had total revenues of $4.0 billion in 2018, an increase of 20% compared to 2017 on a reported basis and 19% excluding the foreign currency impact. Net income increased to $122.5 million in 2018 from $3.3 million in 2017 and, as a result, diluted earnings per share was $1.33 in 2018 compared to $0.04 in 2017. Research revenues increased to $3.1 billion during 2018, or 26% compared to 2017 on a reported basis and 25% excluding the foreign currency impact. The Research gross contribution margin improved by two points in 2018, to 69%. Total contract value was $3.2 billion at December 31, 2018, an increase of 11% compared to December 31, 2017 on a foreign currency neutral basis. Conferences revenues increased to $410.5 million in 2018, or 21% compared to 2017 on a reported basis and 22% excluding the foreign currency impact. The Conferences gross contribution margin was 50% and 48% in 2018 and 2017, respectively. We held 70 and 69 destination conferences in 2018 and 2017, respectively. Consulting revenues increased to $353.7 million in 2018, or 8% compared to 2017 on a reported basis and 7% excluding the foreign currency impact. The Consulting gross contribution margin was 29% for both 2018 and 2017. Backlog was $110.7 million at December 31, 2018. Cash provided by operating activities was $471.2 million and $254.5 million during 2018 and 2017, respectively. As of December 31, 2018, we had $156.4 million of cash and cash equivalents and $1.0 billion of available borrowing capacity on our revolving credit facility. CRITICAL ACCOUNTING POLICIES AND ESTIMATES The preparation of our consolidated financial statements requires the application of appropriate accounting policies and the use of estimates. Our significant accounting policies are described in Note 1 Business and Significant Accounting Policies in the Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements included in this Annual Report on Form 10-K. Management considers the policies discussed below to be critical to an understanding of our financial statements because their application requires complex and subjective management judgments and estimates. Specific risks for these critical accounting policies are also described below. The preparation of our consolidated financial statements requires us to make estimates and assumptions about future events. We develop our estimates using both current and historical experience, as well as other factors, including the general economic environment and actions we may take in the future. We adjust such estimates when facts and circumstances dictate. However, our estimates may involve significant uncertainties and judgments and cannot be determined with precision. In addition, these estimates are based on our best judgment at a point in time and, as such, they may ultimately differ materially from actual results. Ongoing changes in our estimates could be material and would be reflected in the Company consolidated financial statements in future periods. Our critical accounting policies pertaining to the years presented in the consolidated financial statements included in this Annual Report on Form 10-K are described below. Revenue recognition On January 1, 2018, the Company adopted Financial Accounting Standards Board ("FASB") Accounting Standards Update No. 2014-09, "Revenue from Contracts with Customers" ("ASU No. 2014-09"). ASU No. 2014-09 and related amendments required changes in revenue recognition policies as well as enhanced disclosures. Among other things, ASU No. 2014-09 requires a five-step evaluative process that consists of: (1) Identifying the contract with the customer; (2) Identifying the performance obligations in the contract; (3) Determining the transaction price for the contract; 21 (4) Allocating the transaction price to the performance obligations in the contract; and (5) Recognizing revenue when (or as) performance obligations are satisfied. The Company adopted ASU No. 2014-09 on January 1, 2018 using the modified retrospective method of adoption. Under this method of adoption, the cumulative effect of applying the new standard is recorded at the date of initial application, with no restatement of the comparative prior periods presented. The adoption of ASU No. 2014-09 did not have a material impact on the Company consolidated financial statements. However, the adoption of the new standard required reclassifications of certain amounts presented in the Company consolidated balance sheet. Prior to January 1, 2018, the Company recognized revenue in accordance with then-existing generally accepted accounting principles in the United States of America and SEC Staff Accounting Bulletin No. 104, "Revenue Recognition" ( prior GAAP ). Under both ASU No. 2014-09 and prior GAAP, revenue can only be recognized when all of the required criteria are met. Note 1 Business and Significant Accounting Policies in the Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements provides additional information regarding our adoption of ASU No. 2014-09 and its impact on the Company's consolidated financial statements and related disclosures. Our revenue by significant source is accounted for as follows: Research revenues are mainly derived from subscription contracts for research products. The related revenues are deferred and recognized ratably over the applicable contract term. Fees derived from assisting organizations in selecting the right business software for their needs are recognized when the leads are provided to vendors. Conferences revenues are deferred and recognized upon the completion of the related conference or meeting. Consulting revenues are principally generated from fixed fee and time and material engagements. Revenues from fixed fee contracts are recognized as we work to satisfy our performance obligations. Revenues from time and materials engagements are recognized as work is delivered and/or services are provided. Revenues related to contract optimization contracts are contingent in nature and are only recognized upon satisfaction of all conditions related to their payment. The majority of Research contracts are billable upon signing, absent special terms granted on a limited basis from time to time. Research contracts are generally non-cancelable and non-refundable, except for government contracts that may have cancellation or fiscal funding clauses. It is our policy to record the amount of a subscription contract that is billable as a fee receivable at the time the contract is signed with a corresponding amount as deferred revenue because the contract represents a legally enforceable claim. Uncollectible fees receivable At December 31, 2017, the Company maintained an allowance for losses that was comprised of a bad debt allowance and a revenue reserve. In connection with the adoption of ASU No. 2014-09 on January 1, 2018, management concluded that the revenue reserve was a refund liability rather than a contra-receivable due to the nature of the account activity. As a result, the Company reclassified the revenue reserve of $6.2 million on January 1, 2018 from the allowance for losses to Accounts payable and accrued liabilities and will consistently present the revenue reserve in this manner in all future consolidated balance sheets. Note 1 Business and Significant Accounting Policies in the Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements provides additional information regarding our adoption of ASU No. 2014-09 and its impact on the Company's allowance for losses. Increases and decreases in the allowance for losses are charged to earnings, either to expense (i.e., the bad debt allowance) or revenues (i.e., the revenue reserve). The determination of the bad debt allowance is based on historical loss experience, an assessment of current economic conditions, the aging of outstanding receivables, the financial health of specific clients and probable losses. This evaluation is inherently judgmental and requires estimates. The Company's bad debt allowance is periodically re-evaluated and adjusted as more information about the ultimate collectability of fees receivable becomes available. Circumstances that could cause our bad debt allowance to increase include changes in our clients liquidity and credit quality, other factors negatively impacting our clients ability to pay their obligations as they come due, and the effectiveness of our collection efforts. The following table presents our total fees receivable and the related allowance for losses (in thousands): December 31, 2018 2017 Total fees receivable (1) $ 1,262,818 $ 1,189,543 Allowance for losses (2) (7,700 ) (12,700 ) Fees receivable, net $ 1,255,118 $ 1,176,843 22 (1) Total fees receivable at December 31, 2017 included $26.7 million of contract assets. As a result of the Company's adoption of ASU No. 2014-09 on January 1, 2018, contract assets are now included in Prepaid expenses and other current assets on the Company's consolidated balance sheet at December 31, 2018. (2) The allowance for losses at December 31, 2017 included $6.2 million that was attributable to the Company's revenue reserve. As a result of the Company's adoption of ASU No. 2014-09 on January 1, 2018, the revenue reserve balance is now included in Accounts payable and accrued liabilities on the Company's consolidated balance sheet at December 31, 2018. Goodwill and other intangible assets When we acquire a business, we determine the fair value of the assets acquired and liabilities assumed on the date of acquisition, which may include a significant amount of intangible assets such as customer relationships, software and content, as well as resulting goodwill. When determining the fair values of the acquired intangible assets, we consider, among other factors, analyses of historical financial performance and an estimate of the future performance of the acquired business. The fair values of the acquired intangible assets are primarily calculated using an income approach that relies on discounted cash flows. This method starts with a forecast of the expected future net cash flows for the asset and then adjusts the forecast to present value by applying an appropriate discount rate that reflects the risk factors associated with the cash flow streams. We consider this approach to be the most appropriate valuation technique because the inherent value of an acquired intangible asset is its ability to generate future income. In a typical acquisition, we engage a third-party valuation expert to assist us with the fair value analyses for acquired intangible assets. Determining the fair values of acquired intangible assets requires us to exercise significant judgment. We select reasonable estimates and assumptions based on evaluating a number of factors, including, but not limited to, marketplace participants, consumer awareness and brand history. Additionally, there are significant judgments inherent in discounted cash flows such as estimating the amount and timing of projected future cash flows, the selection of appropriate discount rates, hypothetical royalty rates and contributory asset capital charges. Specifically, the selected discount rates are intended to reflect the risk inherent in the projected future cash flows generated by the underlying acquired intangible assets. Determining an acquired intangible asset's useful life also requires significant judgment and is based on evaluating a number of factors, including, but not limited to, the expected use of the asset, historical client retention rates, consumer awareness and trade name history, as well as any contractual provisions that could limit or extend an asset's useful life. The Company evaluates recorded goodwill in accordance with FASB Accounting Standards Codification ("ASC") Topic 350, which requires goodwill to be assessed for impairment at least annually and whenever events or changes in circumstances indicate that the carrying value of goodwill may not be recoverable. In addition, an impairment evaluation of our amortizable intangible assets may also be performed if events or circumstances indicate potential impairment. Among the factors that could trigger an impairment review are current operating results that do not align with our annual plan or historical performance; changes in our strategic plan or the use of our assets; restructuring charges or other changes in our business segments; competitive pressures and changes in the general economy or in the markets in which we operate; and a significant decline in our stock price and our market capitalization relative to our net book value. FASB ASC Topic 350 requires an annual assessment of the recoverability of recorded goodwill, which can be either quantitative or qualitative in nature, or a combination of the two approaches. Both methods utilize estimates which, in turn, require judgments and assumptions regarding future trends and events. As a result, both the precision and reliability of the resulting estimates are subject to uncertainty. If our goodwill impairment evaluation determines that the fair value of a reporting unit is less than its related carrying amount, we may recognize an impairment charge. Among the factors that we consider in a qualitative assessment are general economic conditions and the competitive environment; actual and projected reporting unit financial performance; forward-looking business measurements; and external market assessments. A quantitative analysis requires management to consider each of the factors relevant to a qualitative assessment, as well as the utilization of detailed financial projections, to include the rate of revenue growth, profitability and cash flows, as well as assumptions regarding discount rates, the Company's weighted average cost of capital and other data, in order to determine a fair value for our reporting units. We conducted a quantitative assessment of the fair value of all of the Company's reporting units during the quarter ended September 30, 2018. Our assessment determined that the fair values of the Company's reporting units continue to exceed their respective carrying values and, as a result, no goodwill impairment was indicated. Note 1 Business and Significant Accounting Policies in the Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements provides additional information regarding goodwill and amortizable intangible assets. Accounting for income taxes The Company uses the asset and liability method of accounting for income taxes. We estimate our income taxes in each of the jurisdictions where we operate. This process involves estimating our current tax expense or benefit together with assessing temporary differences resulting from differing treatment of items for tax and accounting purposes. These differences result in deferred tax assets and liabilities, which are included in our consolidated balance sheets. When assessing the 23 realizability of deferred tax assets, we consider if it is more likely than not that some or all of the deferred tax assets will not be realized. In making this assessment, we consider the availability of loss carryforwards, projected reversals of deferred tax liabilities, projected future taxable income, and ongoing prudent and feasible tax planning strategies. The Company recognizes the tax benefit from an uncertain tax position only if it is more likely than not that the tax position will be sustained based on the technical merits of the position. Accounting for stock-based compensation The Company accounts for stock-based compensation awards in accordance with FASB ASC Topics 505 and 718 and SEC Staff Accounting Bulletins No. 107 and No. 110. The Company recognizes stock-based compensation expense, which is based on the fair value of the award on the date of grant, over the related service period. Note 8 Stock-Based Compensation in the Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements provides additional information regarding stock-based compensation. Determining the appropriate fair value model and calculating the fair value of stock-based compensation awards requires the use of certain subjective assumptions, including the expected life of a stock-based compensation award and the Company common stock price volatility. In addition, determining the appropriate periodic stock-based compensation expense requires management to estimate the likelihood of the achievement of certain performance targets. The assumptions used in calculating the fair values of stock-based compensation awards and the related periodic expense represent management best estimates, which involve inherent uncertainties and the application of judgment. As a result, if circumstances change and the Company deems it necessary in the future to modify the assumptions it made or to use different assumptions, or if the quantity and nature of the Company stock-based compensation awards changes, then the amount of expense may need to be adjusted and future stock-based compensation expense could be materially different from what has been recorded in the current period. Restructuring and other accruals We may record accruals for severance costs, costs associated with excess facilities that we have leased, contract terminations, asset impairments and other costs as a result of ongoing actions we undertake to streamline our organization, reposition certain businesses and reduce costs. Estimates of costs to be incurred to complete these actions, such as future lease payments, sublease income, the fair value of assets, and severance and related benefits, are based on assumptions at the time the actions are initiated. These accruals may need to be adjusted to the extent that actual costs differ from such estimates. In addition, these actions may be revised due to changes in business conditions that we did not foresee at the time such plans were approved. We also record accruals during the year for our various employee cash incentive programs. Amounts accrued at the end of each reporting period are based on our estimates and may require adjustment as the ultimate amount paid for these incentives are sometimes not known with certainty until the end of our fiscal year. Accounting for leases The Company adopted FASB Accounting Standards Update No. 2016-02, " Leases ," as amended ("ASU No. 2016-02"), on January 1, 2019. Prior thereto, the Company recognized lease expense in accordance with FASB ASC Topic 840, Leases . Note 1 Business and Significant Accounting Policies in the Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements provides additional information regarding our leases and the adoption of the new leasing standard. 24 RESULTS OF OPERATIONS Consolidated Results 2018 VERSUS 2017 The table below presents an analysis of selected line items and year-over-year changes in our Consolidated Statements of Operations for the years indicated (in thousands). The operating results of CEB are included beginning on April 5, 2017, the date of the acquisition. Year Ended December 31, 2018 Year Ended December 31, 2017 Effect on Net Income - Increase (Decrease) Increase (Decrease) % Total revenues $ 3,975,454 $ 3,311,494 $ 663,960 20 % Costs and expenses: Cost of services and product development 1,468,800 1,320,198 (148,602 ) (11 ) Selling, general and administrative 1,884,141 1,599,004 (285,137 ) (18 ) Depreciation 68,592 63,897 (4,695 ) (7 ) Amortization of intangibles 187,009 176,274 (10,735 ) (6 ) Acquisition and integration charges 107,197 158,450 51,253 32 Operating income (loss) 259,715 (6,329 ) 266,044 >100 Interest expense, net (124,208 ) (124,936 ) 728 1 Gain from divested operations 45,447 45,447 >100 Other income, net 167 3,448 (3,281 ) (95 ) Provision (benefit) for income taxes 58,665 (131,096 ) (189,761 ) >(100) Net income $ 122,456 $ 3,279 $ 119,177 >100% TOTAL REVENUES for the year ended December 31, 2018 increased $664.0 million, to $4.0 billion, an increase of 20% compared to the year ended December 31, 2017 on a reported basis and 19% excluding the foreign currency impact. A portion of the total revenue increase for 2018 compared to 2017 was due to the CEB acquisition. The table below presents total revenues by geographic region for the years indicated (in thousands): Geographic Region Year Ended December 31, 2018 Year Ended December 31, 2017 Increase (Decrease) $ Increase (Decrease) % United States and Canada $ 2,514,952 $ 2,092,366 $ 422,586 20 % Europe, Middle East and Africa 1,000,490 855,421 145,069 17 Other International 460,012 363,707 96,305 26 Totals $ 3,975,454 $ 3,311,494 $ 663,960 20 % The table below presents our revenues by segment for the years indicated (in thousands): Segment Year Ended December 31, 2018 Year Ended December 31, 2017 Increase (Decrease) $ Increase (Decrease) % Research $ 3,105,764 $ 2,471,280 $ 634,484 26 % Conferences 410,461 337,903 72,558 21 Consulting 353,667 327,661 26,006 8 Other (1) 105,562 174,650 (69,088 ) (40 ) Totals $ 3,975,454 $ 3,311,494 $ 663,960 20 % (1) During 2018, the Company divested all three of the non-core businesses that comprised its Other segment. 25 Refer to the section of this MD&A below entitled Segment Results for a discussion of revenues and results by segment. COST OF SERVICES AND PRODUCT DEVELOPMENT was $1.5 billion in 2018, an increase of $148.6 million compared to 2017, or 11% on both a reported basis and excluding the foreign currency impact. This increase was primarily due to higher payroll and related benefits costs resulting from increased headcount, as well as incremental payroll and related benefits costs resulting from the CEB acquisition. Cost of services and product development as a percent of revenues was 37% and 40% for 2018 and 2017, respectively, with the improvement in 2018 primarily due to the negative impact on revenue from the deferred revenue fair value accounting adjustment, which was substantially less in 2018 compared to 2017. SELLING, GENERAL AND ADMINISTRATIVE ( SG&A ) expense was $1.9 billion in 2018, an increase of $285.1 million compared to 2017, or 18% on a reported basis and 17% excluding the foreign currency impact. This increase was primarily due to: (i) higher commissions from increased sales bookings; (ii) incremental costs from the CEB acquisition; (iii) higher facilities and corporate costs; and (iv) more payroll and related benefits costs, which were driven mostly by increased headcount. These items were partially offset by a reduction in SG&A expense resulting from certain businesses that were divested during 2018. The overall headcount growth includes increases in quota bearing sales associates at Global Technology Sales and Global Business Sales to 3,104 and 790, respectively, at December 31, 2018. On a combined basis, the total number of quota-bearing sales associates increased by 16% when compared to December 31, 2017. SG&A expense as a percent of revenues was 47% and 48% for 2018 and 2017, respectively. DEPRECIATION increased $4.7 million during 2018 when compared to 2017. Such increase was due to property, equipment and leasehold improvements acquired with CEB and additional Gartner investments. AMORTIZATION OF INTANGIBLES increased $10.7 million during 2018 when compared to 2017. Such increase was due to additional amortization recorded in connection with our 2017 acquisitions. ACQUISITION AND INTEGRATION CHARGES declined in 2018 compared to 2017 as the Company had two acquisitions in 2017 and none in 2018. Acquisition and integration charges consist of additional costs and expenses resulting from our acquisitions and include, among other items, professional fees, severance, stock-based compensation charges and accruals for exit costs for certain office space in Arlington, Virginia related to our acquisition of CEB that the Company does not intend to occupy. During 2018, exit costs represented the single largest component of our acquisition and integration charges. OPERATING INCOME (LOSS) was operating income of $259.7 million in 2018 compared to an operating loss of $6.3 million in 2017. The improvement in profitability in 2018 reflects several factors, including (i) higher Research and Conferences segment contributions, and (ii) reduced acquisition and integration charges. These items were partially offset by higher cost of services and product development, SG&A expense and amortization of intangibles. INTEREST EXPENSE, NET declined slightly in 2018 compared to 2017. The weighted-average debt outstanding in 2018 was approximately $2.5 billion compared to $2.8 billion in 2017. Offsetting the favorable impact of the lower weighted-average debt outstanding in 2018 was a higher weighted-average annual effective interest rate during 2018 when compared to 2017. GAIN FROM DIVESTED OPERATIONS was $45.4 million in 2018 and was attributable to sales of certain business units and other miscellaneous assets. Additional information is included in Note 2 Acquisitions and Divestitures in the Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements while additional information regarding our segments is included in Note 14 Segment Information. OTHER INCOME, NET for 2018 and 2017 primarily reflects the net impact of foreign currency gains and losses from our hedging activities, as well as sales of certain state tax credits and the recognition of other tax incentives. PROVISION (BENEFIT) FOR INCOME TAXES in 2018 was an expense of $58.7 million on pretax income of $181.1 million compared to a benefit of $131.1 million on a pretax loss of $127.8 million in 2017. The effective income tax rate was 32.4% in 2018 compared to 102.6% in 2017. Both periods included favorable adjustments for the impact of the U.S. Tax Cuts and Jobs Act of 2017. The adjustment in 2017 was more significant than 2018 and had a larger favorable impact on the 2017 effective tax rate. The 2017 tax rate was also favorably impacted by the recognition of unrealized capital losses from a divested business. See Note 10 - Income Taxes in the Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements included in this Annual Report on Form 10-K for further information related to the Company effective tax rates. NET INCOME was $122.5 million and $3.3 million during 2018 and 2017, respectively. Additionally, our diluted income per share increased by $1.29 in 2018 when compared to 2017. These changes reflect an improvement in our 2018 operating profitability 26 and the gain from divested operations, partially offset by an increase in our income tax expense. Our 2017 income taxes included the favorable impacts from the U.S. Tax Cuts and Jobs Act of 2017. 2017 VERSUS 2016 The table below presents an analysis of selected line items and year-over-year changes in our Consolidated Statements of Operations for the years indicated (in thousands). The operating results of CEB are included beginning on April 5, 2017, the date of the acquisition.

CEB contributed approximately $522.9 million of the revenue increase.

Approximately $238.0 million of the increase was attributable to CEB. The additional increase of $136.6 million in cost of services and product development was primarily due to higher payroll and related benefits costs resulting from increased headcount, which increased 20% exclusive of incremental CEB personnel. Cost of services and product development as a percentage of revenues was 40% and 39% for 2017 and 2016, respectively. SELLING, GENERAL AND ADMINISTRATIVE ( SG&A ) expense was $1.6 billion in 2017, an increase of $509.8 million compared to 2016, or 47% on both a reported basis and excluding the foreign currency impact. Approximately $283.8 million of the increase was attributable to CEB. In addition to these incremental CEB-related costs, all other SG&A costs increased $226.0 million in 2017, primarily due to $107.4 million in higher payroll and related benefits costs, reflecting a 17% overall headcount increase; $33.8 million in higher commissions due to increased sales bookings; and $84.8 million in higher corporate costs and foreign exchange impact. Such overall headcount growth includes a 15% increase in non-CEB quota-bearing sales associates. SG&A expense as a percent of revenues was 48% and 45% for 2017 and 2016, respectively. DEPRECIATION increased $26.7 million during 2017 when compared to 2016, due to property, equipment and leasehold improvements acquired with CEB and additional Gartner investments. AMORTIZATION OF INTANGIBLES increased $151.5 million during 2017 when compared to 2016 due to additional amortization from the intangibles recorded in connection with our 2017 acquisitions. ACQUISITION AND INTEGRATION CHARGES increased $115.9 million during 2017 when compared to 2016. Acquisition and integration charges reflect additional costs and expenses resulting from our acquisitions and include, among other items, professional fees, severance, stock-based compensation charges and accruals for exit costs in 2017 for certain office space in Arlington, Virginia related to our acquisition of CEB that the Company does not intend to occupy. Our acquisition and integration charges increased in 2017 because of the Company's acquisitions during that year. OPERATING (LOSS) INCOME was an operating loss of $6.3 million during 2017 compared to operating income of $305.1 million in 2016. The decline reflects several factors. We had a lower segment contribution margin in our Research business resulting from a CEB deferred revenue fair value adjustment. We also had higher SG&A and acquisition-related costs, including depreciation, amortization of intangibles, and acquisition and integration charges. INTEREST EXPENSE, NET increased $99.8 million during 2017 when compared to 2016. The increase was primarily due to higher borrowings during 2017. OTHER INCOME, NET was $3.4 million during 2017, primarily reflecting the net impact of foreign currency gains and losses from our hedging activities, as well as the sale of certain state tax credits and the recognition of other tax incentives. Other income, net was $8.4 million in 2016, which included a gain of $2.5 million from the extinguishment of a portion of an economic development loan from the State of Connecticut, the sale of certain state tax credits and the recognition of other tax incentives, and the net impact of gains and losses from our foreign currency hedging activities. (BENEFIT) PROVISION FOR INCOME TAXES in 2017 was a benefit of $131.1 million on a pretax loss of $127.8 million compared to an expense of $94.8 million on pretax income of $288.4 million in 2016. The effective income tax rate was 102.6% in 2017 compared to 32.9% in 2016. The change in the effective income tax rate was primarily attributable to the favorable impact of U.S. tax reform, the recognition in 2017 of unrealized capital losses on the then-pending divestiture of the CEB Talent Assessment business, and increases in tax benefits associated with equity compensation. NET INCOME was $3.3 million and $193.6 million during 2017 and 2016, respectively. The year-over-year change primarily reflects declines in our operating profitability and higher interest expense, partially offset by income tax benefits in 2017, including the impact of the Tax Cuts and Jobs Act of 2017. As a result of substantially lower net income and a 7% increase in the number of weighted average shares outstanding, diluted earnings per share declined to $0.04 in 2017 from $2.31 in 2016. 28 SEGMENT RESULTS We evaluate reportable segment performance and allocate resources based on gross contribution margin. Gross contribution is defined as operating income (loss), excluding certain Cost of services and product development charges, SG&A expenses, Depreciation, Acquisition and integration charges, and Amortization of intangibles. Gross contribution margin is defined as gross contribution as a percent of revenues. Business Divestitures During 2018, the Company divested all three of the non-core businesses that comprised its Other segment, each of which were acquired as part of the acquisition of CEB Inc. in April 2017. As a result of these divestitures and the movement of a small residual product in the Other segment into the Research business, the Company is no longer recording any additional operating activity in the Other segment effective September 1, 2018. Additional information regarding the divestitures is included in Note 2 Acquisitions and Divestitures in the Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements included in this Annual Report on Form 10-K. The Company's current reportable segments are as follows: Research provides trusted, objective insights and advice on the mission-critical priorities of leaders across all functional areas of the enterprise through research and other reports, briefings, proprietary tools, access to our analysts and advisors, peer networking services and membership programs that enable our clients to make better decisions. Gartner's traditional strengths in IT, marketing and supply chain research were enhanced in 2017 with Gartner's acquisition of CEB Inc., which added CEB's best practice and talent management research insights across a range of business functions, to include human resources, finance, sales and legal. Conferences (formerly called Events) provides business professionals across the organization the opportunity to learn, share and network. From our flagship CIO conference Gartner IT Symposium, to industry-leading conferences focused on specific business roles and topics, to member-driven sessions, our offerings enable attendees to experience the best of Gartner insight and advice live. Consulting provides customized solutions to unique client needs through on-site, day-to-day support, as well as proprietary tools for measuring and improving IT performance with a focus on cost, performance, efficiency and quality. The sections below present the results of the Company's three currently reportable business segments and its Other segment: Research As Of And For The Year Ended December 31, 2018 As Of And For The Year Ended December 31, 2017 Increase (Decrease) Percentage Increase (Decrease) As Of And For The Year Ended December 31, 2017 As Of And For The Year Ended December 31, 2016 Increase (Decrease) Percentage Increase (Decrease) Financial Measurements: Revenues (1) $3,105,764 $2,471,280 $ 634,484 26 % $2,471,280 $1,857,001 $ 614,279 33 % Gross contribution (1) $2,144,097 $1,653,014 $ 491,083 30 % $1,653,014 $1,285,611 $ 367,403 29 % Gross contribution margin 69 % 67 % 2 points 67 % 69 % (2) points Business Measurements: Global Technology Sales (2): Contract value (1), (3) $2,556,000 $2,238,000 $ 318,000 14 % $2,238,000 $1,975,000 $ 263,000 13 % Client retention 83 % 83 % 83 % 82 % 1 point Wallet retention 105 % 105 % 105 % 103 % 2 points Global Business Sales (2): Contract value (1), (3) $607,000 $601,000 $ 6,000 1 % $601,000 $568,000 33,000 6 % Client retention 82 % 81 % 1 point 81 % 76 % 5 points Wallet retention 95 % 100 % (5) points 100 % 95 % 5 points (1) Dollars in thousands. 29 (2) Global Technology Sales ("GTS") includes sales to users and providers of technology. Global Business Sales ("GBS") includes sales to all other functional leaders. (3) Contract values are on a foreign exchange neutral basis and exclude certain amounts related to divested businesses. Additional information regarding our divestitures is included in Note 2 Acquisitions and Divestitures in the Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements included in this Annual Report on Form 10-K. The contract values at December 31, 2016 include pre-acquisition CEB amounts that were calculated using Gartner's methodology as well as 2018 foreign exchange rates. 2018 VERSUS 2017 Research revenues increased by $634.5 million during 2018 compared to 2017, or 26% on a reported basis and 25% excluding the foreign currency impact. Higher revenues in 2018 were primarily driven by (i) a double-digit increase in subscription revenues in 2018, a portion of which was due to the impact of the CEB acquisition, as 2018 included a full year of revenue compared to nine months in 2017; and (ii) the negative impact on revenue in 2017 from the deferred revenue fair value accounting adjustment resulting from the CEB acquisition, which had a significantly lesser impact in 2018. The gross contribution margin improved by two points in 2018, primarily due to (i) a negative impact on margin in 2017 from the deferred revenue fair value accounting adjustment, which had a significantly lesser impact in 2018; and (ii) improvement in margins for our premium services in 2018. Total contract value increased to $3.2 billion at December 31, 2018, or 11%. Total contract value at December 31, 2018 increased by double-digits across almost all of the Company client sizes as well as about three-quarters of its industry segments when compared to December 31, 2017. GTS and GBS contract values increased 14% and 1%, respectively, at December 31, 2018 when compared to December 31, 2017. The 14% increase in GTS contract value during 2018 reflects additional sales headcount and productivity improvements. The slower 1% growth in GBS contract value during 2018 reflects the Company's strategic decision to discontinue new sales of the largest legacy enterprise products in favor of new seat-based GxL products (i.e., products for business leaders across an enterprise). GTS client retention was 83% as of both December 31, 2018 and 2017, while wallet retention was 105% at both dates. GBS client retention was 82% and 81% as of December 31, 2018 and 2017, respectively, while wallet retention was 95% and 100%, respectively. The number of GTS client enterprises increased by 6% at December 31, 2018 when compared to December 31, 2017, while the corresponding number of GBS client enterprises decreased by 4% year-over-year. 2017 VERSUS 2016 Research revenues increased by $614.3 million during 2017 compared to 2016, or 33% on both a reported basis and excluding the foreign currency impact. On a reported basis, CEB contributed $309.6 million of the 2017 increase. The additional increase of $304.7 million in Research revenues represented a 16% increase in our non-CEB Research revenues on both a reported basis and excluding the foreign currency impact, with approximately one point of the increase due to L2, Inc., which we acquired in the first quarter of 2017. The gross contribution margin declined by two points during 2017, primarily due to the impact of the deferred revenue fair value accounting adjustment resulting from the CEB acquisition. Excluding the foreign currency impact, GTS and GBS contract values increased 13% and 6%, respectively, at December 31, 2017 when compared to December 31, 2016. Total contract value increased to $2.8 billion at December 31, 2017, or 12%. Total contract value at December 31, 2017 increased by double-digits across all of the Company sales regions and client sizes and virtually every industry segment compared to December 31, 2016. GTS client retention was 83% and 82% as of December 31, 2017 and 2016, respectively, while wallet retention was 105% and 103%, respectively. GBS client retention was 81% and 76% as of December 31, 2017 and 2016, respectively, while wallet retention was 100% and 95%, respectively. The number of GTS client enterprises increased by 7% at December 31, 2017 when compared to December 31, 2016, while the corresponding number of GBS client enterprises was flat year-over-year. 30 Conferences The Conferences segment was previously called Events.

A portion of the revenue increase for 2018 was due to the CEB acquisition, as 2018 included a full year of revenue compared to nine months in 2017. Revenues from both attendees and exhibitors at our destination conferences, as well as revenues from our single day local meetings, increased by double-digits during 2018. We held 70 destination conferences in 2018 with a 16% increase in the number of attendees and an 8% increase in exhibitors when compared to 2017, while the average revenue per attendee and exhibitor increased by 5% and 7%, respectively. The gross contribution margin improved by two points in 2018 compared to 2017 due to greater profitability at our ongoing conferences, which was primarily driven by increased attendee and exhibitor participation and improvements in our average revenue per attendee and exhibitor, as well as our continuing efforts to efficiently manage our conference-related expenses. 2017 VERSUS 2016 Conferences revenues increased by $69.3 million during 2017 compared to 2016, or 26% on a reported basis and 25% excluding the foreign currency impact. On a reported basis, CEB contributed $38.6 million of the 2017 increase, including four destination conferences with 3,578 attendees. The additional increase of $30.7 million in our segment revenues represented an 11% increase in our non-CEB Conferences revenues on a reported basis and 10% excluding the foreign currency impact, with such revenues for both attendees and exhibitors increasing by double-digits. Overall, we held 69 destination conferences in 2017 with a 23% increase in the number of attendees and a 6% increase in exhibitors when compared to 2016, while the average revenue per exhibitor increased by 3% and the average revenue per attendee declined by 4%. The gross contribution margin declined by three points in 2017 compared to 2016, primarily due to additional investment in headcount and higher program expenses and, to a lesser extent, a dilutive effect from the CEB destination conferences. 31 Consulting As Of And For The Year Ended December 31, 2018 As Of And For The Year Ended December 31, 2017 Increase (Decrease) Percentage Increase (Decrease) As Of And For The Year Ended December 31, 2017 As Of And For The Year Ended December 31, 2016 Increase (Decrease) Percentage Increase (Decrease) Financial Measurements: Revenues (1) $353,667 $327,661 $ 26,006 8 % $327,661 $318,934 $ 8,727 3 % Gross contribution (1) $102,541 $93,643 $ 8,898 10 % $93,643 $89,734 $ 3,909 4 % Gross contribution margin 29 % 29 % 29 % 28 % 1 point Business Measurements: Backlog (1) $110,700 $95,200 $ 15,500 16 % $95,200 $88,600 $ 6,600 7 % Billable headcount 718 669 49 7 % 669 628 41 7 % Consultant utilization 63 % 64 % (1) point 64 % 66 % (2) points Average annualized revenue per billable headcount (1) $ 375 $ 366 $ 9 2 % $ 366 $ 383 $ (17 ) (4 )% (1) Dollars in thousands. 2018 VERSUS 2017 Consulting revenues increased 8% during 2018 compared to 2017 on a reported basis and 7% excluding the foreign currency impact, with revenue improvements in labor-based core consulting and contract optimization of 9% and 2%, respectively, on a reported basis. The gross contribution margin was 29% for both 2018 and 2017. Backlog increased by $15.5 million, or 16%, from December 31, 2017 to December 31, 2018. The $110.7 million of backlog at December 31, 2018 represented approximately four months of backlog, which is in line with the Company's operational target. 2017 VERSUS 2016 Consulting revenues increased 3% during 2017 compared to 2016 on both a reported basis and excluding the foreign currency impact, with revenue improvements in both labor-based core consulting and contract optimization. The gross contribution margin was 29% and 28% for 2017 and 2016, respectively. The margin improvement in 2017 was primarily due to additional contract optimization revenue, which has a higher contribution margin than our labor-based core consulting, partially offset by lower consultant utilization and our investment in additional managing partners. Backlog increased by $6.6 million, or 7%, from December 31, 2016 to December 31, 2017. The $95.2 million of backlog at December 31, 2017 represented approximately four months of backlog, which is in line with the Company's operational target. 32 Other As Of And For The Year Ended December 31, 2018 As Of And For The Year Ended December 31, 2017 Increase (Decrease) Percentage Increase (Decrease) Financial Measurements: Revenues (1) $105,562 $174,650 $ (69,088 ) (40 )% Gross contribution (1) $65,075 $90,249 $ (25,174 ) (28 )% Gross contribution margin 62 % 52 % 10 points (1) Dollars in thousands. During 2018, the Company divested all three of the non-core businesses that comprised its Other segment, each of which were acquired as part of the acquisition of CEB Inc. in April 2017. Both revenue and gross contribution declined in 2018 compared to 2017 due to the divestitures. As a result of the divestitures and the movement of a small residual product in the Other segment into the Research business, the Company is no longer recording any additional operating activity in the Other segment effective September 1, 2018. Additional information regarding the divestitures is included in Note 2 Acquisitions and Divestitures in the Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements included in this Annual Report on Form 10-K. 33 LIQUIDITY AND CAPITAL RESOURCES We finance our operations through cash generated from our operating activities and borrowings. Note 5 Debt in the Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements included in this Annual Report on Form 10-K provides additional information regarding the Company's outstanding debt obligations. At December 31, 2018, we had $156.4 million of cash and cash equivalents and $1.0 billion of available borrowing capacity on the revolving credit facility under our 2016 Credit Agreement. We believe that the Company has adequate liquidity to meet its currently anticipated needs. We have historically generated significant cash flows from our operating activities. Our operating cash flow has been continuously maintained by the leverage characteristics of our subscription-based business model in our Research segment, which is our largest business segment and historically has constituted the majority of our total revenues. The majority of our Research customer contracts are paid in advance and, combined with a strong customer retention rate and high incremental margins, has resulted in continuously strong operating cash flow. Cash flow generation has also benefited from our ongoing efforts to improve the operating efficiencies of our businesses as well as a focus on the optimal management of our working capital as we increase sales. Our cash and cash equivalents are held in numerous locations throughout the world with 79% held overseas at December 31, 2018. The Company intends to reinvest substantially all of its accumulated undistributed foreign earnings, except in instances where repatriation would result in minimal additional tax. As a result of the U.S. Tax Cuts and Jobs Act of 2017, we believe that the income tax impact if such earnings were repatriated would be minimal. The following table summarizes the changes in the Company's cash balances for the years indicated (in thousands): 2018 vs. 2017 2017 vs. 2016 Year Ended December 31, 2018 Year Ended December 31, 2017 Increase (Decrease) Year Ended December 31, 2017 Year Ended December 31, 2016 Increase (Decrease) Cash provided by operating activities $ 471,158 $ 254,517 $ 216,641 $ 254,517 $ 365,632 $ (111,115 ) Cash provided by (used in) investing activities 384,051 (2,752,545 ) 3,136,596 (2,752,545 ) (98,059 ) (2,654,486 ) Cash (used in) provided by financing activities (1,257,115 ) 2,539,830 (3,796,945 ) 2,539,830 (174,686 ) 2,714,516 Net (decrease) increase in cash and cash equivalents (401,906 ) 41,802 (443,708 ) 41,802 92,887 (51,085 ) Effects of exchange rate changes (6,489 ) 25,902 (32,391 ) 25,902 (5,640 ) 31,542 Beginning cash and cash equivalents 567,058 499,354 67,704 499,354 412,107 87,247 Ending cash and cash equivalents (1) $ 158,663 $ 567,058 $ (408,395 ) $ 567,058 $ 499,354 $ 67,704 (1) The December 31, 2018 ending cash balance of $158.7 million consisted of $156.4 million of cash and cash equivalents and $2.3 million of restricted cash. 2018 VERSUS 2017 Operating Cash provided by operating activities was $471.2 million in 2018 compared to $254.5 million in 2017, an increase of $216.6 million. The year-over-year increase was driven by net income of $122.5 million in 2018 compared to net income of $3.3 million in 2017, as well as substantially higher receivable collections during 2018. Partially offsetting these increases in 2018 were higher cash amounts paid for bonuses, taxes, and interest on our borrowings, as well as decreases in our other working capital accounts. Investing Cash provided by investing activities was $384.1 million in 2018, with $510.9 million in net cash realized from business divestiture and acquisition activities, which was partially offset by approximately $126.8 million of capital expenditures. In 2017, cash used in investing activities was $2.8 billion, primarily due to business acquisitions. 34 Financing Cash used in financing activities was approximately $1.3 billion in 2018 compared to cash provided of $2.5 billion in 2017. During 2018, the Company used $1.0 billion in cash to reduce its outstanding debt and used $260.8 million in cash for share repurchases.

Investing Cash used in investing activities was $2.8 billion in 2017 compared to $98.1 million of cash used in 2016. Cash used in 2017 was substantially higher primarily due to business acquisitions.
