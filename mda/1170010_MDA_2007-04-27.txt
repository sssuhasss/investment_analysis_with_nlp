Item 7. Management Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations. The following Management Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations ( MD&A ) is provided as a supplement to, and should be read in conjunction with, our consolidated financial statements and the accompanying notes presented in Item 8, Consolidated Financial Statements and Supplementary Data. Note references are to the notes to consolidated financial statements included in Item 8. Amounts and percentages in tables may not total due to rounding. Certain prior year amounts have been reclassified to conform to the current year presentation. We adopted Statement of Financial Accounting Standards ( SFAS ) No. 123 (Revised 2004), Share-Based Payment ( SFAS 123(R) ), effective March 1, 2006, applying the modified retrospective method. As a result, prior period amounts have been restated to reflect the adoption of this standard. On February 22, 2007, the board of directors declared a 2-for-1 stock split in the form of a common stock dividend for shareholders of record on March 19, 2007, which was distributed on March 26, 2007. All share and per share data included in MD&A have been adjusted to reflect this stock split. BUSINESS OVERVIEW General CarMax is the nation largest retailer of used vehicles. We pioneered the used car superstore concept, opening our first store in 1993. At February 28, 2007, we operated 77 used car superstores in 36 markets, including 26 mid-sized markets, 9 large markets, and 1 small market. We define mid-sized markets as those with television viewing populations generally between 600,000 and 2.5 million people. We also operated seven new car franchises, all of which are integrated or co-located with our used car superstores. In fiscal 2007, we sold 337,021 used cars, representing 95% of the total 355,584 vehicles we sold at retail. We believe the CarMax consumer offer is unique in the automobile retailing marketplace. Our offer gives consumers a way to shop for cars in the same manner that they shop for items at other big box retailers. Our consumer offer is structured around our four core equities: low, no-haggle prices; a broad selection; high quality; and customer-friendly service. Our website, carmax.com, is a valuable tool for communicating the CarMax consumer offer, a sophisticated search engine, and an efficient channel for customers who prefer to conduct their shopping online. We generate revenues, income, and cash flows primarily by retailing used vehicles and associated items including vehicle financing, extended service plans ( ESP ), and retail service. A majority of the used vehicles we sell at retail are purchased directly from consumers. We also generate revenues, income, and cash flows from the sale of vehicles purchased through our appraisal process that do not meet our retail standards. These vehicles are sold at our on-site wholesale auctions. Wholesale auctions are conducted at the majority of our superstores and are held on a weekly, bi-weekly, or monthly basis. In fiscal 2007, we sold 208,959 vehicles at our wholesale auctions. On average, the vehicles we wholesale are approximately 10 years old and have more than 100,000 miles. Participation in our wholesale auctions is restricted to licensed automobile dealers, the majority of whom are independent dealers and licensed wholesalers. CarMax provides financing to qualified customers through CarMax Auto Finance ( CAF ), the company finance operation, and Bank of America, and through several other third-party lenders. We collect fixed, prenegotiated fees from the majority of our third-party lenders, and we periodically test additional lenders. CarMax has no recourse liability for the loans provided by third-party lenders. We sell ESPs on behalf of unrelated third parties who are the primary obligors. We have no contractual liability to the customer under these third-party service plans. Extended service plan revenue represents commissions from the unrelated third parties. We are still at a relatively early stage in the national rollout of our retail concept. We believe the primary driver for future earnings growth will be vehicle unit sales growth from comparable stores and from geographic expansion. Table of Contents 18 We target a similar dollar amount of gross profit per used unit, regardless of retail price. Used unit sales growth is our primary focus. We plan to open used car superstores at a rate of approximately 15% to 20% of our used car superstore base each year. In fiscal 2008, we plan to open 13 superstores, expanding our store base by approximately 17%. Over the long term, we expect comparable store used unit sales increases to average in the range of 4% to 8%, reflecting the multi-year ramp in sales at newly opened stores as they mature, continued market share gains at stores that have reached basic maturity sales levels, which we estimate occurs in a store fifth year of operation, and underlying industry sales growth. The principal challenges we face in expanding our store base include our ability to build our management bench strength to support the store growth and our ability to procure suitable real estate at reasonable costs. We staff each newly opened store with an experienced management team. We must therefore continually recruit, train, and develop managers and associates to fill the pipeline necessary to support future store openings. If at any time we believed that the rate of store growth was causing our performance to falter, we would consider slowing the growth rate. Fiscal 2007 Highlights Net sales and operating revenues increased 19% to $7.47 billion from $6.26 billion in fiscal 2006, while net earnings increased 48% to $198.6 million, or $0.92 per share, from $134.2 million, or $0.63 per share. Total used vehicle unit sales increased 16%, reflecting the combination of our 9% increase in comparable store used unit sales and the growth in our store base. Total wholesale vehicle unit sales increased 16%, consistent with our used vehicle unit sales growth. We opened ten used car superstores in fiscal 2007, including five standard superstores and five satellite superstores. Our total gross profit per unit increased to $2,731 from $2,544 in fiscal 2006. We realized improvements in gross profit per unit in all categories, including used vehicles, new vehicles, wholesale vehicles, and other. We believe our used vehicle gross profit benefited from our strong, consistent sales performance, which resulted in fewer pricing markdowns being made, as well as a more stable underlying economic environment. CAF income increased 27% to $132.6 million from $104.3 million in fiscal 2006. The improvement reflected the growth in retail vehicle sales and managed receivables, an improvement in the gain on loans originated and sold, and an increase in the average amount financed. CAF income included a benefit of $13.0 million, or $0.04 per share for favorable items, primarily valuation adjustments of our retained interest, in fiscal 2007, compared with a benefit of $15.2 million, or $0.04 per share in fiscal 2006. Selling, general, and administrative expenses as a percent of net sales and operating revenues (the SG&A ratio ) declined to 10.4% from 10.8% in fiscal 2006. We benefited from the leverage of fixed expenses generated by our strong comparable store sales growth. As a result of adopting SFAS 123(R) in fiscal 2007, we recognized share-based compensation expense of $0.09 per share in fiscal 2007 compared with $0.07 per share in fiscal 2006, as restated. The fiscal 2007 expense includes costs of $0.02 per share resulting from the retirement of our former chief executive officer. Net cash provided by operations increased to $136.8 million from $117.5 million in fiscal 2006, primarily reflecting the improved net earnings offset by increased investment in working capital. CRITICAL ACCOUNTING POLICIES Our results of operations and financial condition as reflected in the consolidated financial statements have been prepared in accordance with U.S. generally accepted accounting principles. Preparation of financial statements requires management to make estimates and assumptions affecting the reported amounts of assets, liabilities, revenues, expenses, and the disclosures of contingent assets and liabilities. We use our historical experience and other relevant factors when developing our estimates and assumptions. We continually evaluate these estimates and assumptions. Note 2 includes a discussion of significant accounting policies. The accounting policies discussed below are the ones we consider critical to an understanding of our consolidated financial statements because their application places the most significant demands on our judgment. Our financial results might have been different if different assumptions had been used or other conditions had prevailed. Securitization Transactions We use a securitization program to fund substantially all of the automobile loan receivables originated by CAF. The securitization transactions are accounted for as sales. A gain, recorded at the time of the securitization transaction, Table of Contents 19 results from recording a receivable equal to the present value of the expected residual cash flows generated by the securitized receivables. The fair value of our retained interest in securitization transactions includes the present value of the expected residual cash flows generated by the securitized receivables, cash reserve accounts, and an undivided ownership interest in the receivables. The present value of the expected residual cash flows generated by the securitized receivables is determined by estimating the future cash flows using management assumptions of key factors, such as finance charge income, loss rates, prepayment rates, and discount rates appropriate for the type of asset and risk. These assumptions are derived from historical experience and projected economic trends. Adjustments to one or more of these assumptions may have a material impact on the fair value of the retained interest. The fair value of the retained interest may also be affected by external factors, such as changes in the behavior patterns of customers, changes in the economy, and developments in the interest rate markets. Note 2(C) includes a discussion of accounting policies related to securitizations. Note 4 includes a discussion of securitizations and provides a sensitivity analysis showing the hypothetical effect on the retained interest if there were variations from the assumptions used. In addition, see the CarMax Auto Finance Income section of this MD&A for a discussion of the effect of changes in our assumptions. Revenue Recognition We recognize revenue when the earnings process is complete, generally either at the time of sale to a customer or upon delivery to a customer. We recognize used vehicle revenue when a sales contract has been executed and the vehicle has been delivered, net of a reserve for returns under our 5-day, money-back guarantee. A reserve for vehicle returns is recorded based on historical experience and trends, and it could be affected if future vehicle returns differ from historical averages. We also sell ESPs on behalf of unrelated third parties to customers who purchase a vehicle. Because these third parties are the primary obligors under these programs, we recognize commission revenue on the ESPs at the time of the sale, net of a reserve for returns. The reserve for ESP returns is recorded based on historical experience and trends, and it could be affected if future returns differ from historical averages. Income Taxes Estimates and judgments are used in the calculation of certain tax liabilities and in the determination of the recoverability of certain of the deferred tax assets. In the ordinary course of business, transactions occur for which the ultimate tax outcome is uncertain at the time of the transactions. We adjust our income tax provision in the period in which we determine that it is probable that our actual results will differ from our estimates. Tax law and rate changes are reflected in the income tax provision in the period in which such changes are enacted. We evaluate the need to record valuation allowances that would reduce deferred tax assets to the amount that will more likely than not be realized. When assessing the need for valuation allowances, we consider future reversals of existing temporary differences and future taxable income. We believe that all of our recorded deferred tax assets as of February 28, 2007, will more likely than not be realized. However, if a change in circumstances results in a change in our ability to realize our deferred tax assets, our tax provision would increase in the period when the change in circumstances occurs. In addition, the calculation of our tax liabilities involves dealing with uncertainties in the application of complex tax regulations. We recognize potential liabilities for anticipated tax audit issues in the U.S. and other tax jurisdictions based on our estimate of whether, and the extent to which, additional taxes will be due. If payments of these amounts ultimately prove to be unnecessary, the reversal of the liabilities would result in tax benefits being recognized in the period when we determine the liabilities are no longer necessary. If our estimate of tax liabilities proves to be less than the ultimate assessment, a further charge to expense would result in the period of determination. Information regarding income taxes is presented in Note 7. Defined Benefit Retirement Plan The plan obligations and related assets of our defined benefit retirement plan are presented in Note 8. Plan assets, which consist primarily of marketable equity and debt instruments, are valued using current market quotations. Plan obligations and the annual pension expense are determined by independent actuaries using a number of assumptions provided by the company. Key assumptions used to measure the plan obligations include the discount rate, the Table of Contents 20 estimated rate of salary increases, and the estimated future return on plan assets. In determining the discount rate, we use the current yield on high-quality, fixed-income investments that have maturities corresponding to the anticipated timing of the benefit payments. Salary increase assumptions are based upon our historical experience and anticipated future board and management actions. Asset returns are estimated based upon the anticipated average yield on the plan assets. We do not believe that any significant changes in assumptions used to measure the plan obligations are likely to occur that would have a material impact on our financial position or results of operations.

The 23% increase in used vehicle revenues in fiscal 2007 reflected a 16% increase in unit sales and a 6% increase in average retail selling price. The unit sales growth reflected a 9% increase in comparable store used units, together with sales from newer superstores not yet in the comparable store base. Our comparable store used unit sales growth benefited from strong store and Internet traffic and continued strong execution by our store teams. The increase in the average retail selling price was primarily the result of a shift in vehicle mix, as we experienced a resurgence in the sales of SUVs and trucks, which we believe had been adversely affected in the prior year by consumer reaction to higher gasoline prices. The increase in average retail selling price also reflected growth in the percentage of luxury vehicles in our sales mix. Sales financed by Drive Financial Services declined to less than 1% of our used vehicle unit sales in fiscal 2007 from approximately 3% in fiscal 2006. In the fourth quarter of fiscal 2006, this lender implemented program changes in certain states, narrowing the selection of vehicles it would finance, and making this business less economically attractive to us. We chose to curtail our business with Drive in these states to preserve margins and profits. The decline in Drive-financed sales in fiscal 2007 was substantially offset, however, by incremental sales financed by additional lenders added to our third-party lender group in the second half of fiscal 2006. Fiscal 2006 Versus Fiscal 2005. The 19% increase in used vehicle revenues in fiscal 2006 reflected a 15% increase in unit sales and a 4% increase in average retail selling price. The unit sales growth reflected sales from newer superstores not yet in the comparable store base, together with a 4% increase in comparable store used units. The comparable store used unit sales growth was driven by an increase in store traffic, combined with continued strong execution by our store teams. Store traffic and comparable store sales increases were particularly strong during the period from June through September 2005, which coincided with the domestic new car manufacturers employee pricing incentive programs. Under these programs, the manufacturers established specific employee prices, available to all consumers, for each make and model. These programs created greater clarity on new car pricing and increased traffic in the marketplace, both of which we believe benefited CarMax. Our no-haggle consumer offer makes price comparing easy, and we believe it gives us a unique advantage as consumers cross-shop. Sales financed by Drive, which was added to our third-party lender group in mid-fiscal 2005, remained approximately 3% of total used vehicle unit sales in fiscal 2006 and fiscal 2005. The full-year benefit of adding this lender was offset by the program curtailments made in the fourth quarter of fiscal 2006. New Vehicle Sales Fiscal 2007 Versus Fiscal 2006. The 11% decline in new vehicle revenues in fiscal 2007 was substantially the result of a decline in unit sales, and in part reflects our strategic decision in fiscal 2007 to increase targeted gross profit dollars per unit on new vehicles. We had anticipated that this decision would result in some reduction in new vehicle unit sales. The decline in new vehicle unit sales also reflects the effects of reduced industry new car sales for several of the brands we represent, including Chevrolet, DaimlerChrysler, and Nissan. Fiscal 2006 Versus Fiscal 2005. The 2% increase in new vehicle revenues in fiscal 2006 was due to a 1% increase in unit sales and a 1% increase in average retail selling price. New vehicle unit sales were strong during the domestic new car manufacturers employee pricing programs in June through September 2005; however, these increases were substantially offset by the effects of softer industry new car sales in the months following the end of these programs. New vehicle sales were generally in line with industry performance for the core brands we Table of Contents 22 represent Chevrolet, DaimlerChrysler, Nissan, and Toyota. Our disposition of five new car franchises in the second half of fiscal 2005 also affected the change in our new car unit sales. Wholesale Vehicle Sales Our operating strategy is to build customer satisfaction by offering high-quality vehicles. Fewer than half of the vehicles acquired from consumers through the appraisal purchase process meet our standards for reconditioning and subsequent retail sale. Those vehicles that do not meet our standards are sold at our on-site wholesale auctions. Fiscal 2007 Versus Fiscal 2006. The 18% increase in wholesale vehicle revenues in fiscal 2007 resulted from a 16% increase in wholesale unit sales and a 1% increase in average wholesale selling price. Our wholesale unit sales benefited from a substantial increase in appraisal traffic, primarily spurred by our strong comparable store unit sales growth, and the expansion of our store base. In the first half of fiscal 2007, our average wholesale selling price climbed 6% reflecting, we believe, the residual effects of industry shortages of older, higher-mileage vehicles experienced following Hurricanes Katrina, Rita, and Wilma in the fall of 2005. In the second half of fiscal 2007, our average wholesale selling price was 4% below the prior year level reflecting the challenging comparison with the previous year. Fiscal 2006 Versus Fiscal 2005. The 32% increase in wholesale vehicle revenues in fiscal 2006 reflected a 16% increase in wholesale unit sales and a 14% increase in average wholesale selling price. Our wholesale unit sales growth benefited from a strong increase in appraisal traffic combined with the expansion of our store base. Appraisal traffic was higher throughout fiscal 2006, but it was particularly strong in the second quarter. We believe this increase was due, in part, to the domestic new car manufacturers employee pricing programs. In these programs, franchised dealers lost some ability to negotiate on trade-ins due to their inability to negotiate on the published employee discount price on new cars. In addition, the employee pricing programs coincided with a period of rapid decline in wholesale values for SUVs and large trucks as the result of a spike in gasoline prices, making some dealers reluctant to accept these vehicles in trade. These factors created an influx of appraisal traffic at CarMax as we continued to make appraisal purchase offers on all vehicles presented for appraisal. Appraisal traffic also benefited from our focused We Buy Cars advertising during fiscal 2006. Our on-site wholesale auctions exhibited unusual aggregate price strength in fiscal 2006, reflecting trends in the general wholesale market. We believe some of the factors that may have contributed to the unusually strong wholesale market pricing environment during various portions of the year included reduced supplies of off-lease and off-rental cars; the strong demand for smaller, fuel-efficient cars in the face of rising gasoline prices; and hurricanes Katrina, Rita, and Wilma, which destroyed an estimated 400,000 to 600,000 vehicles and created a short-term supply/demand imbalance. Wholesale industry price increases were especially strong in older, higher mileage cars that make up the majority of the vehicles we sell at wholesale. Our wholesale prices also benefited from a record level of dealer attendance at our auctions and a record dealer-to-car ratio in fiscal 2006. We believe the high dealer attendance at our auctions reflected the industry shortage of older vehicles as well as our continuing efforts to attract dealers to our auctions. Other Sales and Revenues Fiscal 2007 Versus Fiscal 2006. Other sales and revenues increased 10% in fiscal 2007. The increase was primarily the result of increased sales of ESPs and an increase in third-party finance fees. The increase in ESP sales was consistent with our increase in used vehicle unit sales. The third-party finance fees benefited from the decline in Drive-financed sales. We record the discount at which this lender purchases loans as an offset to the third-party finance fee revenues. Service department sales declined modestly in fiscal 2007, as the reconditioning activities required to support our strong comparable store used vehicle sales growth limited the service capacity available for customer pay work. Fiscal 2006 Versus Fiscal 2005. Other sales and revenues increased 14% in fiscal 2006, as all components benefited from the increase in retail vehicle sales and the expansion of our superstore base.

(2) Calculated as a percentage of its respective sales or revenue. Used Vehicle Gross Profit We target a similar dollar amount of gross profit per used unit, regardless of retail price. Our ability to quickly adjust appraisal offers to be consistent with the broader market trade-in trends and our rapid inventory turns reduce our exposure to the inherent continual depreciation in used vehicle values and contribute to our ability to manage our gross profit dollars per unit. In addition, over the past few years, we have continued to refine our car-buying strategies, which we believe has benefited our used vehicle gross profit per unit. Fiscal 2007 Versus Fiscal 2006. Our used vehicle gross profit increased $95 per unit in fiscal 2007. This increase reflected the benefit of our strong, consistent sales performance throughout the year. We believe several external factors contributed to a greater degree of sales volatility in the prior year, including significant changes in gasoline prices, new vehicle incentives, and interest rates. We did not experience similar variability in these external factors in fiscal 2007, and therefore benefited from a more stable business environment. We employ a volume-based strategy, and we systematically mark down individual vehicle prices based on our proprietary pricing algorithms in order to appropriately balance sales growth, inventory turns, and gross profit achievement. When customer traffic and our sales are consistently strong, we generally take fewer pricing markdowns, which in turn maximizes our gross profit dollars per unit. In addition, our used vehicle gross profit in fiscal 2006 was adversely affected by slowing demand for SUVs and trucks that have lower gas mileage, which resulted in higher pricing markdowns for these vehicles. Fiscal 2006 Versus Fiscal 2005. While our used vehicle gross profit dollars per unit in fiscal 2006 was similar to that achieved in fiscal 2005, our used vehicle gross profits remained under some pressure throughout fiscal 2006. The profit pressure was primarily the result of the combination of the strong wholesale industry pricing and our desire to price our retail cars at competitive levels for consumers comparing options in the new and used car markets. A strong wholesale industry pricing environment increases our cost of acquiring vehicles both in our in-store purchases and at auction. We were able to offset some of the resulting profit pressure through successful refinements in our in-store appraisal strategy. During portions of fiscal 2006, we did not increase our appraisal offers at the same rate as the steep increase in the major public wholesale auction market prices, as we did not believe the price trends at the major public wholesale auctions were reflective of the broader market trade-in offer trends. This belief was reinforced by the fact that we continued to experience strong increases in appraisal traffic while maintaining our ratio of appraisal buys to appraisal offers. This strategy allowed us to keep our retail prices more in line with underlying retail demand, while maintaining gross profit dollars per unit. New Vehicle Gross Profit Fiscal 2007 Versus Fiscal 2006. Our new vehicle gross profit increased $235 per unit in fiscal 2007. The increase primarily reflected our strategic decision to increase targeted new vehicle gross profit dollars per unit. While this decision contributed to a reduction in new vehicle unit sales, it resulted in an increase in the total gross profit contribution from new vehicles. Fiscal 2006 Versus Fiscal 2005. Our new vehicle gross profit increased $74 per unit in fiscal 2006. The increase was primarily attributable to the higher profits realized during the domestic new car manufacturers employee pricing programs. We were able to modestly increase our new car prices during these programs, as our pricing had generally been below the manufacturers specified employee discount prices. Table of Contents 25 Wholesale Vehicle Gross Profit Fiscal 2007 Versus Fiscal 2006. In spite of the challenging comparison with the prior year, our wholesale vehicle gross profit increased $42 per unit in fiscal 2007. Our wholesale vehicle profitability has steadily increased over the last several years, reflecting the benefits realized from improvements and refinements in our car-buying strategies, our appraisal delivery processes, and our in-store auction processes. We have made continuous improvements in these processes, which we believe has allowed us to become more efficient. Our in-store auctions have benefited from our initiatives to increase average dealer attendance, which we believe has allowed us to achieve higher prices. Fiscal 2006 Versus Fiscal 2005. Our wholesale vehicle gross profit increased $236 per unit in fiscal 2006. We believe a portion of this increase resulted from the unusually strong wholesale pricing environment in fiscal 2006. In addition, the refinements in our in-store appraisal strategy benefited our wholesale operations, while allowing us to maintain used vehicle gross profit dollars per unit levels in the face of rising vehicle acquisition costs. While we did not increase our appraisal offers at the same rate as the steep increase in the major public wholesale auction market prices, our own wholesale auctions generally reflected the pricing trends of the public wholesale auctions. Our wholesale gross profit was particularly strong in the second half of fiscal 2006 as the result of a combination of factors. The supply/demand imbalance for older, higher mileage cars created by Hurricanes Katrina, Rita, and Wilma resulted in unusually strong demand and price realizations for our wholesale vehicles. In addition, as we normally do in the third quarter, we adjusted our appraisal offers to incorporate the anticipated seasonal drop in wholesale pricing. Wholesale industry pricing typically declines during the fall due to pressure from model year closeout sales and from reduced demand at auction as dealers pare back inventories heading into the slower-volume winter months. We were particularly aggressive in our appraisals of SUVs where wholesale prices had fallen dramatically through the summer following sharp increases in the cost of gasoline. Pricing in the overall wholesale marketplace did not decline as much as anticipated, however, giving us unusually high third quarter wholesale gross profits. Other Gross Profit Fiscal 2007 Versus Fiscal 2006. Other gross profit increased $40 per unit in fiscal 2007. The improvement was the result of the growth in ESP sales and third-party finance fees, both of which have no associated cost of sales, and an increase in service department margins. Our service department reported higher profits, reflecting the greater overhead expense absorption provided by the significant increase in used vehicles sales and the associated reconditioning volumes. Fiscal 2006 Versus Fiscal 2005. Other gross profit per unit increased $25 per unit in fiscal 2006. The improvement was primarily the result of improved penetration in sales of ESPs and the growth in service profits. The service department, which is the only category within other sales and revenues that has an associated cost of sales, reported higher profits reflecting the greater overhead expense absorption provided by the higher vehicle sales and reconditioning volumes. Impact of Inflation Inflation has not been a significant contributor to results. Profitability is based on achieving targeted unit sales and gross profit dollars per vehicle rather than on average retail prices. However, CAF income will benefit from an increase in the average amount financed. CarMax Auto Finance Income CAF provides automobile financing for our used and new car sales. Because the purchase of an automobile is traditionally reliant on the consumer ability to obtain on-the-spot financing, it is important to our business that financing be available to creditworthy customers. While financing can also be obtained from third-party sources, we believe that total reliance on third parties can create unacceptable volatility and business risk. Furthermore, we believe that our processes and systems, the transparency of our pricing, and our vehicle quality provide a unique and ideal environment in which to procure high-quality auto finance receivables, both for CAF and for our third-party lenders. CAF provides us the opportunity to capture additional profits and cash flows from auto loan receivables while managing our reliance on third-party finance sources.

We present this information on a direct basis to avoid making arbitrary decisions regarding the indirect benefit or costs that could be attributed to this operation. Examples of indirect costs not included are retail store expenses and corporate expenses such as human resources, administrative services, marketing, information systems, accounting, legal, treasury, and executive payroll. CAF originates automobile loans to qualified customers at competitive market rates of interest. The majority of the profit contribution from CAF is generated by the spread between the interest rates charged to customers and our cost of funds. Substantially all of the loans originated by CAF are sold in securitization transactions. A gain, recorded at the time of securitization, results from recording a receivable approximately equal to the present value of the expected residual cash flows generated by the securitized receivables. In a normalized environment, we expect the gains on loans originated and sold as a percent of loans originated and sold (the gain percentage ) to be in the range of 3.5% to 4.5%. Total gain income in fiscal 2007, 2006, and 2005 included the effects of retained interest valuation adjustments, new public securitizations, and the repurchase and resale of receivables in existing public securitizations. The following table provides information on the aggregate effect of these items on gain income, loans sold, and the gain percentage. Table of Contents 27 Gain Income and Loans Sold Years Ended February 28 (In millions) 2007 2006 2005 Gains on sales of loans originated and sold $ 86.7 $ 61.9 $ 54.9 Other gain income 13.0 15.2 3.3 Total gain income $ 99.7 $ 77.1 $ 58.3 Loans originated and sold $ 2,240.2 $ 1,792.6 $ 1,483.8 Receivables repurchased from public securitizations and resold 82.5 94.8 51.0 Total loans sold $ 2,322.7 $ 1,887.5 $ 1,534.8 Gain percentage on loans originated and sold 3.9 % 3.5 % 3.7 % Total gain income as a percentage of total loans sold 4.3 % 4.1 % 3.8 % Fiscal 2007 Versus Fiscal 2006. CAF income rose 27% to $132.6 million in fiscal 2007. CAF income benefited from the growth in retail vehicle unit sales, and increases in the gain percentage, average amount financed, and total managed receivables. The gain percentage increased to 3.9% in fiscal 2007 from 3.5% in fiscal 2006, reflecting changes in the interest rate environment. In fiscal 2006, our funding costs were rising faster than rates charged to consumers resulting in a lower gain percentage. In fiscal 2007, the relative stability in our funding cost allowed us to achieve a higher gain percentage. The increases in other CAF income and direct CAF expenses in fiscal 2007 were proportionate to the growth in managed receivables during the year. We recognized other gain income of $13.0 million, or $0.04 per share in fiscal 2007 compared with $15.2 million, or $0.04 per share, in fiscal 2006. In fiscal 2007, substantially all of the other gain income resulted from favorable valuation adjustments. In fiscal 2006, other gain income included $0.03 per share of favorable valuation adjustments, $0.01 per share of favorable effects from new public securitizations, and a favorable effect of less than $0.01 per share from the repurchase and resale of receivables in existing public securitizations. These items are discussed below: Valuation adjustments . The net favorable valuation adjustments in both fiscal 2007 and fiscal 2006 primarily resulted from lowering loss rate assumptions, mostly on pools of receivables securitized in calendar years 2003, 2004, and 2005. We believe these pools of receivables experienced lower-than-expected loss rates as a result of a combination of factors, including better-than-expected performance of our new credit scorecard implemented in calendar year 2002, favorable economic conditions, operating efficiencies resulting from systems enhancements, and an improved recovery rate. New public securitizations . CarMax periodically repurchases receivables from the warehouse facility and refinances them in public securitizations. The impact of refinancing receivables can be favorable or unfavorable depending on the relative economics of funding structures at the time the receivables are refinanced. These transactions did not have a material impact in fiscal 2007. In fiscal 2006, we recognized a benefit of $0.01 per share as we refinanced balances from the warehouse facility into new public securitizations. Repurchase and resale of receivables . Our securitizations typically contain an option to repurchase the securitized receivables when the outstanding balance in a pool of automobile loan receivables falls below 10% of the original pool balance. This option was exercised two times in each of fiscal 2007 and 2006. In each case, the remaining eligible automobile loan receivables were subsequently resold into the warehouse facility. These transactions did not have a material impact in fiscal 2007. In fiscal 2006, the spread between the APR on the loans and the then-current funding cost in the warehouse facility resulted in an earnings benefit. In future years, the effect of refinancing, repurchase, and resale activity could be favorable or unfavorable depending on the securitization structure and market conditions at the transaction date. Table of Contents 28 Fiscal 2006 Versus Fiscal 2005. CAF income rose 26% to $104.3 million in fiscal 2006. The fiscal 2006 total gain income benefited from the growth in retail vehicle sales and a substantial increase in other gain income, partially offset by a modest decline in the gain percentage to 3.5% from 3.7% in fiscal 2005. The increases in other CAF income and direct CAF expenses in fiscal 2006 were proportionate to the growth in managed receivables during the year. Other gain income was $15.2 million in fiscal 2006 compared with $3.3 million in fiscal 2005. In fiscal 2005, approximately half of the other gain income related to favorable valuation adjustments, and the remainder primarily resulted from the repurchase and resale of receivables in existing public securitizations. Past Due Account Information As of February 28 (In millions) 2007 2006 2005 Loans securitized $ 3,242.1 $ 2,710.4 $ 2,427.2 Loans held for sale or investment 68.9 62.0 67.7 Total managed receivables $ 3,311.0 $ 2,772.5 $ 2,494.9 Accounts 31+ days past due $ 56.9 $ 37.4 $ 31.1 Past due accounts as a percentage of total managed receivables 1.72 % 1.35 % 1.24 % Credit Loss Information Years Ended February 28 (In millions) 2007 2006 2005 Net credit losses on managed receivables $ 20.7 $ 18.4 $ 19.5 Average managed receivables $ 3,071.1 $ 2,657.7 $ 2,383.6 Net credit losses as a percentage of average managed receivables 0.67 % 0.69 % 0.82 % Recovery rate 51 % 51 % 46 % We are at risk for the performance of the managed securitized receivables to the extent of our retained interest in the receivables. If the managed receivables do not perform in accordance with the assumptions used in determining the fair value of the retained interest, earnings could be impacted. Past due accounts as a percentage of total managed receivables increased moderately in fiscal 2007. While credit losses as a percentage of averaged managed receivables decreased slightly in fiscal 2007, the decrease was attributable to favorability in the first half of the year, offset by higher losses in the second half of the year. We believe the increase in losses during the second half of the year was the result of a combination of factors, including a gradual shift in credit mix of the portfolio as well as less favorable general economic and industry trends. Receivables originated in calendar years 2003, 2004, and early 2005 have experienced loss rates well below both CAF historical averages and our targeted loss rates. We believe this favorability was due, in part, to the credit scorecard we implemented in late 2002. As it became evident that the scorecard was resulting in lower-than-expected loss rates, CAF gradually expanded its credit offers beginning in late 2004. As a result, receivables originated in late 2005 and 2006 have been experiencing higher loss and delinquency rates than receivables originated in those prior years. The changes in loss and delinquency rates were largely anticipated and were incorporated in our initial loss assumptions for these pools. The recovery rate represents the average percentage of the outstanding principal balance we receive when a vehicle is repossessed and liquidated at wholesale auction. We believe the improvement in the recovery rate in fiscal 2006 reflected the stronger wholesale market pricing environment. Selling, General, and Administrative Expenses Fiscal 2007 Versus Fiscal 2006. The SG&A ratio declined to 10.4% from 10.8% in fiscal 2006. We benefited from the leverage of fixed expenses generated by our strong comparable store sales growth. The improvement in the fiscal 2007 SG&A ratio was partially offset by an increase in share-based compensation costs and by the recognition of an impairment loss totaling $4.9 million, or $0.01 per share. The impairment loss related to the write down of intangible assets associated with one of our new car franchises. Table of Contents 29 We recognized $32.7 million, or $0.09 per share, of share-based compensation costs in fiscal 2007, $30.4 million of which was included in SG&A, compared with $22.4 million, or $0.07 per share, in fiscal 2006, all of which was included in SG&A. The increase in share-based compensation cost was driven, in large part, by the accelerated vesting of stock options upon the retirement of our former chief executive officer in August 2006. Fiscal 2006 Versus Fiscal 2005. The SG&A ratio increased slightly to 10.8% from 10.7% in fiscal 2005. The moderate rate of increase in comparable store used unit sales in fiscal 2006 was not sufficient to provide SG&A leverage. The increase in the percentage of our store base that is comprised of newer stores not yet at basic maturity, which generally occurs in the fifth year of operation, also was a contributing factor. Newer stores typically experience higher SG&A ratios during their first four years of operation. On average, 45% of our stores were less than four years old in fiscal 2006 compared with 37% in fiscal 2005. Costs associated with the launch of market-wide television advertising in Los Angeles in fiscal 2006 and the lower-than-normal corporate bonus expense in fiscal 2005 also precluded SG&A leverage. Income Taxes The effective income tax rate was 38.6% in fiscal 2007, 38.3% in fiscal 2006, and 38.9% in fiscal 2005. The fiscal 2006 decrease resulted primarily from a legal entity reorganization in the fourth quarter of fiscal 2005. We created a centralized corporate management entity in an effort to obtain operational, legal, and other benefits that also resulted in state tax efficiencies. OPERATIONS OUTLOOK Store Openings and Capital Expenditures During the fiscal year ending February 29, 2008, we plan to expand our used car superstore base by approximately 17%, opening an estimated 13 used car superstores.

DC / Baltimore Existing market - 1 Total planned openings 5 8 We expect to enter five new markets and expand our presence in six existing markets in fiscal 2008. We currently expect to open approximately four superstores in the first half of fiscal 2008 and nine superstores in the second half of the year. However, normal construction, permitting, or other scheduling delays could shift opening dates of stores into the following fiscal year. In fiscal 2008, we also plan to open three additional car buying centers, with one each in the Raleigh, Dallas, and Tampa markets. These sites will expand a test begun in fiscal 2007, when we opened our first car buying center in the Atlanta market. We only conduct appraisals and purchase cars at these sites and do not sell cars. These test stores are part of our long-term program to increase both appraisal traffic and retail vehicle sourcing self-sufficiency. We currently estimate gross capital expenditures will total approximately $300 million in fiscal 2008. Planned expenditures primarily relate to new store construction and land purchases associated with future year store openings. Compared with the approximately $192 million spent in fiscal 2007, the fiscal 2008 capital spending Table of Contents 30 estimate reflects more real estate purchases for future development in larger, multi-store markets. In addition, the fiscal 2007 capital spending amount was lower than originally projected, due in part to the acquisition of some store sites pursuant to ground leases. Fiscal 2008 Expectations The fiscal 2008 expectations discussed below are based on historical and current trends in our business and should be read in conjunction with Risk Factors, in Part I, Item 1A of this Form 10-K. Fiscal 2008 Sales. We currently anticipate comparable store used unit growth for fiscal 2008 in the range of 3% to 9%. We also expect wholesale unit sales growth to be consistent with our total used unit sales increase. Total revenues are expected to climb by between 14% and 20%, reflecting our expectations for comparable store used unit growth, new store openings, a modest increase in used vehicle average selling price, and a continued decline in our new vehicle sales. Fiscal 2008 Earnings Per Share. We currently anticipate fiscal 2008 earnings per share in the range of $1.03 to $1.14, representing EPS growth in the range of 12% to 24%. We expect modest improvement in both used vehicle and wholesale gross profits per unit in fiscal 2008, as we continue to refine and improve our car-buying processes. We expect CAF income to increase modestly, but at a pace slower than anticipated sales growth, primarily reflecting the challenging comparison created by the $13.0 million of favorable CAF items reported in fiscal 2007. The CAF gain percentage is anticipated to be slightly above the midpoint of our normalized 3.5% to 4.5% range in fiscal 2008, assuming no significant change in the interest rate environment. Our effective tax rate for fiscal 2008 is expected to be similar to the fiscal 2007 rate. However, our diluted share count is expected to increase by approximately 3%, reflecting the effects of the recent increase in our stock price and option exercises on the weighted average share calculation. The diluted share count for the fourth quarter of fiscal 2007 was 1.4% higher than the average for the full year, accounting for approximately one-half of the anticipated 3% increase. RECENT ACCOUNTING PRONOUNCEMENTS For a discussion of recent accounting pronouncements applicable to the company, see Note 15. FINANCIAL CONDITION Operating Activities We generated net cash from operating activities of $136.8 million in fiscal 2007, $117.5 million in fiscal 2006, and $41.8 million in fiscal 2005. Cash generated from operating activities was $19.3 million higher in fiscal 2007 compared with fiscal 2006. The $64.4 million increase in net earnings in fiscal 2007 was more than offset by the increased growth in inventories. Inventories increased by $166.4 million in fiscal 2007 compared with a $93.1 million increase in fiscal 2006. The fiscal 2007 inventory increase related to store openings during fiscal 2007 and shortly after the end of the fiscal year, as well as to added vehicle inventory required to support our strong increase in fourth quarter comparable store used unit sales. Cash generated from operating activities was $75.7 million higher in fiscal 2006 compared with fiscal 2005. The increase reflected the $32.9 million increase in net earnings in fiscal 2006 and a $44.6 million reduction in the year-over-year growth in working capital. The aggregate principal amount of automobile loan receivables funded through securitizations, which are discussed in Notes 3 and 4 totaled $3.24 billion at February 28, 2007, $2.71 billion at February 28, 2006, and $2.43 billion at February 28, 2005. During fiscal 2007, we completed three public automobile securitizations totaling $1.87 billion. At February 28, 2007, the warehouse facility limit was $825.0 million and unused warehouse capacity totaled $227.0 million. The warehouse facility matures in July 2007. Note 4 includes a discussion of the warehouse facility. We anticipate that we will be able to renew, expand, or enter into new securitization arrangements to meet CAF future needs. Table of Contents 31 Investing Activities Net cash used in investing activities was $187.2 million in fiscal 2007, $116.1 million in fiscal 2006, and $141.1 million in fiscal 2005. Capital expenditures were $191.8 million in fiscal 2007, $194.4 million in fiscal 2006, and $230.1 million in fiscal 2005. In addition to store construction costs, capital expenditures for all three years included the cost of land acquired for future year store openings. In fiscal 2006 and fiscal 2005, capital expenditures also included costs associated with our new home office, which was completed in October 2005. Historically, capital expenditures have been funded with internally generated funds, short- and long-term debt, and sale-leaseback transactions. Net proceeds from the sales of assets totaled $4.6 million in fiscal 2007, $78.3 million in fiscal 2006, and $89.0 million in fiscal 2005. The majority of the sale proceeds in fiscal 2006 and fiscal 2005 related to sale-leaseback transactions. In fiscal 2006, we entered into sale-leaseback transactions involving five superstores valued at $72.7 million. In fiscal 2005, we entered into sale-leaseback transactions involving seven superstores valued at approximately $84.0 million. These transactions were structured with initial lease terms of either 15 or 20 years with four, five-year renewal options. At February 28, 2007, we owned 20 superstores currently in operation, as well as the company home office in Richmond, Virginia. In addition, six store facilities were accounted for as capital leases. Financing Activities Net cash provided by financing activities was $48.1 million in fiscal 2007, $3.2 million in fiscal 2006, and $67.7 million in fiscal 2005. We used cash generated from operations to reduce total debt by $9.5 million in fiscal 2007 and $6.8 million in fiscal 2006. In fiscal 2005, we increased total debt by $60.2 million primarily to fund increased inventory. In December 2006, we amended our revolving credit facility. The term of the agreement was extended from August 2009 to December 2011, and the aggregate borrowings available under the agreement were increased from $450 million to $500 million. Borrowings under this credit facility are available for working capital and general corporate purposes, and are secured by our vehicle inventory. As of February 28, 2007, $150.7 million was outstanding under the credit facility, with the remainder fully available to us. The outstanding balance included $3.3 million classified as short-term debt, and $147.4 million classified as current portion of long-term debt. We classified the outstanding balance at February 28, 2007, as current portion of long-term debt based on our expectation that this balance will not remain outstanding for more than one year. Cash received on equity issuances, which primarily related to employee stock option exercises, increased to $35.4 million in fiscal 2007 compared with $6.0 million in fiscal 2006 and $4.3 million in fiscal 2005. The increase reflected exercises by the former chief executive officer in connection with his retirement, and other exercises prompted by the significant increase in our stock price in fiscal 2007. We expect that cash generated by operations; proceeds from securitization transactions; and, if needed, additional debt and sale-leaseback transactions will be sufficient to fund capital expenditures and working capital for the foreseeable future.

Table of Contents 32 Off-Balance Sheet Arrangements CAF provides financing for our used and new car sales. We use a securitization program to fund substantially all of the automobile loan receivables originated by CAF. We sell the automobile loan receivables to a wholly owned, bankruptcy-remote, special purpose entity that transfers an undivided interest in the receivables to a group of third-party investors. This program is referred to as the warehouse facility. We periodically use public securitizations to refinance the receivables previously securitized through the warehouse facility. In a public securitization, a pool of automobile loan receivables is sold to a bankruptcy-remote, special purpose entity that in turn transfers the receivables to a special purpose securitization trust. Additional information regarding the nature, business purposes, and importance of our off-balance sheet arrangement to our liquidity and capital resources can be found in the CarMax Auto Finance Income, Financial Condition, and Market Risk sections of this MD&A, as well as in Notes 3 and 4.
