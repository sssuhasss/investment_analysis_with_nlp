Item 7. Management's Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations Executive Overview The following executive overview summarizes the significant trends affecting our results of operations and financial condition for the periods presented. This overview and the remainder of this management's discussion and analysis supplements and should be read in conjunction with the Consolidated Financial Statements of Invesco Ltd. and its subsidiaries (collectively, the company or Invesco ) and the notes thereto contained elsewhere in this Annual Report on Form 10-K. Global financial markets in 2017 saw strong returns resulting from healthy economic indicators, improving macroeconomic data, and the expectation for benefits from tax reform in the U.S. Equity markets continued a rally that began the previous year as strong corporate earnings, low unemployment, and improving inflation measures helped to spur the strengthening outlook. In 30 Table of Contents the U.S., higher interest rates and better jobs data helped the markets early in the year. The passing of tax reform, including a significant corporate tax rate reduction late in the year, led equity markets higher with the S&P finishing the year at all-time highs up 19.4% . European markets similarly benefited from improving confidence and outlook for future growth, as the plan for the UK exit from the EU continued to take shape. The European Central Bank indicated the potential for a slowing of economic stimulus. The Bank of England increased interest rates, which helped to push the FTSE 100 higher, finishing the year up 7.6% . Strong corporate results in Asia, continued optimism for global growth, and stability for Japan government after the results of a snap election late in the year led the Nikkei higher finishing the year up 19.1% . Bond markets were broadly positive during 2017. Accommodative monetary policy drove corporate and high-yield bond outperformance, while government bonds underperformed on rising interest rate expectations and future changes in central bank policies. Overall, the Barclay U.S. Aggregate Bond index finished the year up 3.5% . The table below summarizes the year ended December 31 returns based on price appreciation/(depreciation) of several major market indices for 2017 , 2016 , and 2015 : Year ended December 31, Equity Index Index expressed in currency 2017 2016 2015 S&P 500 U.S. Dollar 19.4% 9.5% (0.7)% FTSE 100 British Pound 7.6% 14.4% (4.9)% FTSE 100 U.S. Dollar 17.9% (4.1)% (10.1)% Nikkei 225 Japanese Yen 19.1% 0.4% 9.1% Nikkei 225 U.S. Dollar 23.4% 3.8% 8.0% MSCI Emerging Markets U.S. Dollar 34.4% 8.6% (17.0)% Bond Index Barclays U.S. Aggregate Bond U.S. Dollar 3.5% 2.7% 0.6% The company's financial results are impacted by the fluctuations in exchange rates against the U.S. Dollar, as discussed in the "Foreign Exchange Impact on Balance Sheet, Assets Under Management and Results of Operations" section and the "Results of Operations for the Years Ended December 31, 2017 compared to December 31, 2016 compared to December 31, 2015" section below. Throughout 2017, we continued to execute on our long-term strategic objectives, which further improved our ability to serve clients, strengthened our investment performance and helped us deliver competitive levels of operating income and margins. We also took advantage of opportunities in the market and further invested in our products and capabilities, our global platform and our people in ways that strengthened our business and further differentiated us in the marketplace to help ensure our long-term success. In addition, we benefited from our long-term efforts to ensure a diversified base of assets under management. One of Invesco's core strengths, and a key differentiator for the company within the industry, is our broad diversification across client domiciles, asset classes and distribution channels. Our geographical diversification allows us to recognize growth opportunities in various markets in different parts of the world. This broad diversification mitigates the impact on Invesco of different market cycles. As of the filing of this Report, Invesco held credit ratings of A2/Stable, A/Negative and A-/Stable from Moody's Investor Services Moody's, S&P, and Fitch, respectively. One of the company's strategic objectives is to harness the power of our global platform, improving effectiveness and efficiency by allocating our resources to the opportunities that will best benefit clients and our business. Consistent with this objective, business optimization charges of $58.0 million were recorded in 2017, including $30.0 million of staff severance costs recorded in employee compensation expense associated with a business transformation initiative. This is a continuation of efforts to transform several key business support functions to become more effective and efficient by leveraging shared service centers, outsourcing, automation of key processes and optimization of the company's office footprint. Given the size of the opportunity on certain initiatives, including outsourcing of back office functions, the optimization work will continue past the original targeted completion date, and spending has increased. This optimization work will make Invesco a stronger company, further increasing the effectiveness and efficiency of our global platform and will allow us to fund crucial strategic initiatives. As of the end of 2017 , this initiative 31 Table of Contents had produced annualized run-rate expense savings of $43.8 million . These savings have helped offset acquisition and regulatory-related increases in operating expenses. Incremental implementation costs in 2018 are estimated to be up to $35 million , and the initiative is expected to generate annualized run-rate expense savings of up to $65 million by completion. The investment management industry is subject to extensive levels of ongoing regulatory oversight and examination. In the U.S., U.K., and other jurisdictions in which the company operates, governmental authorities regularly make inquiries, conduct investigations and administer examinations with respect to compliance with applicable laws and regulations. The Markets in Financial Instrument Directive (MiFID II) became effective in Europe in January 2018. Invesco is committed to ensuring our investment professionals have access to the external research market in order to achieve our long-term investment performance goals. Therefore, the company has announced that, beginning in January 2018, external research costs incurred for MiFID II impacting funds and client accounts in Europe have been absorbed by the company. We do not expect these costs to be material to the company's financial statements. On August 18, 2017, Invesco acquired 100% of the outstanding shares of the European ETF business. Our European ETF business is a leading independent specialist provider of ETFs based in Europe, which added $26.0 billion in AUM (including approximately $7 billion of externally managed AUM) at acquisition date. The combination strengthens Invesco's existing factor-based capabilities, provides additional scale and relevance in the European ETF market and enhances the firm's ability to meet client needs globally. As previously announced, the company has entered into a definitive agreement to acquire Guggenheim Investments' ETF business, which includes 76 ETFs with $38.4 billion of assets under management as of December 31, 2017 . The acquisition is expected to close in the second quarter of 2018 for an anticipated purchase price of $1.2 billion to be paid in cash. The acquisition will expand the depth, breadth and diversity of Invesco's traditional and smart beta ETFs, while providing additional scale and relevance in the global growing ETF market. It will also build on our existing self-indexing capability and bring in highly complementary capabilities that further strengthen our ability to deliver the outcomes clients seek and position us for accelerated growth in the future. On December 22, 2017, the 2017 Tax Act was signed into law. The 2017 Tax Act, among other items, reduces the federal corporate tax rate from 35% to 21% effective January 1, 2018. Our intention is to use the additional cash flow generated from the lower tax rate first to reduce the anticipated future outstanding balance on the credit facility resulting from the Guggenheim acquisition. After the acquisition is complete and the credit facility balance is reduced, any residual excess will follow our capital management priorities. Invesco continues to demonstrate its commitment to supporting financial advisors with industry leading tools and resources, as we believe these areas are key to delivering superior investment experiences. The range of investment capabilities available through Jemstep are broad across the firm's active, alternative and ETF offerings. Additionally, Jemstep offers open architecture to help advisors provide customized solutions for clients. As a market-leading provider of digital solutions, Jemstep continues to expand its capabilities and market presence, and is an integral part of Invesco's growth strategy. Presentation of Management's Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations -- Impact of Consolidated Investment Products The company provides investment management services to, and has transactions with, various retail mutual funds and similar entities, private equity, real estate, fund-of-funds, collateralized loan obligation products (CLOs), and other investment entities sponsored by the company for the investment of client assets in the normal course of business. The company serves as the investment manager, making day-to-day investment decisions concerning the assets of the products. Investment products that are consolidated are referred to in this Form 10-K (Report) as consolidated investments products (CIP). CIP includes all variable and voting interest entities, as applicable, with effect from the adoption of ASU 2015-02. The company's economic risk with respect to each investment in CIP is limited to its equity ownership and any uncollected management and performance fees. The company is required to consolidate certain managed funds from time-to-time, as discussed more fully in Item 8, Financial Statements and Supplementary Data, Note 1 -- "Accounting Policies -- Basis of Accounting and Consolidation." The majority of the company's CIP balances are CLO-related. The collateral assets of the CLOs are held solely to satisfy the obligations of the CLOs. The company has no right to the benefits from, nor does it bear the risks associated with, the collateral assets held by the CLOs, beyond the company's direct investments in, and management and performance fees generated from, the CLOs. If the company were to liquidate, the collateral assets would not be available to the general creditors of the company, and as a result, the company does not consider them to be company assets. Likewise, the investors in the CLOs have no recourse to 32 Table of Contents the general credit of the company for the notes issued by the CLOs. The company therefore does not consider this debt to be a company liability. The impact of CIP is so significant to the presentation of the company Consolidated Financial Statements that the company has elected to deconsolidate these products in its non-GAAP disclosures. This Management Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations contains four distinct sections, which follow after the Assets Under Management discussion: Results of Operations (years ended December 31, 2017 compared to December 31, 2016 compared to December 31, 2015 ); Schedule of Non-GAAP Information; Balance Sheet Discussion; and Liquidity and Capital Resources. To assess the impact of CIP on the company's Results of Operations and Balance Sheet Discussion, refer to Part II, Item 8, Financial Statements, Note 19 , "Consolidated Investment Products." The impact on the company's results of operations is illustrated by a column which shows the dollar-value change in the consolidated figures, as caused by the consolidation of CIP. For example, the impact of CIP on operating revenues for the year ended December 31, 2017 was a reduction of $32.4 million . This indicates that their consolidation reduced consolidated revenues by this amount, reflecting the elimination upon their consolidation of the operating revenues earned by Invesco for managing these investment products. Wherever a non-GAAP measure is referenced, a disclosure will follow in the narrative or in the note referring the reader to the Schedule of Non-GAAP Information, where additional details regarding the use of the non-GAAP measure by the company are disclosed, along with reconciliations of the most directly comparable U.S. GAAP measures to the non-GAAP measures. To further enhance the readability of the Results of Operations section, separate tables for each of the revenue, expense, and other income and expenses (non-operating income/expense) sections of the income statement introduce the narrative that follows, providing a section-by-section review of the company income statements for the periods presented. Summary Operating Information Summary operating information for 2017 , 2016 and 2015 is presented in the table below. $ in millions, other than per share amounts, operating margins and AUM Year ended December 31, U.S. GAAP Financial Measures Summary 2017 2016 2015 Operating revenues 5,160.3 4,734.4 5,122.9 Operating income 1,277.1 1,176.4 1,358.4 Operating margin 24.7 % 24.8 % 26.5 % Net income attributable to Invesco Ltd. 1,127.3 854.2 968.1 Diluted EPS 2.75 2.06 2.26 Non-GAAP Financial Measures Summary Net revenues (1) 3,754.9 3,393.2 3,643.2 Adjusted operating income (2) 1,480.2 1,312.8 1,493.7 Adjusted operating margin (2) 39.4 % 38.7 % 41.0 % Adjusted net income attributable to Invesco Ltd.

Net revenues are operating revenues plus our proportional share of the net revenues of our joint venture investments, less third-party distribution, service and advisory expenses, plus management and performance fees earned from CIP. See "Schedule of Non-GAAP Information" for the reconciliation of operating revenues to net revenues. 33 Table of Contents (2) Adjusted operating income and adjusted operating margin are non-GAAP financial measures. Adjusted operating margin is adjusted operating income divided by net revenues. Adjusted operating income includes operating income plus our proportional share of the net operating income of our joint venture investments, the operating income impact of the consolidation of investment products, acquisition/disposition related adjustments, compensation expense related to market valuation changes in deferred compensation plans, and other reconciling items. See "Schedule of Non-GAAP Information," for the reconciliation of operating income to adjusted operating income. (3) Adjusted net income attributable to Invesco Ltd. and adjusted diluted EPS are non-GAAP financial measures. Adjusted net income attributable to Invesco Ltd. is net income attributable to Invesco Ltd. adjusted to exclude the net income of CIP, add back acquisition/disposition related adjustments, the net income impact of deferred compensation plans and other reconciling items. Adjustments made to net income attributable to Invesco Ltd. are tax-effected in arriving at adjusted net income attributable to Invesco Ltd. By calculation, adjusted diluted EPS is adjusted net income attributable to Invesco Ltd. divided by the weighted average number of shares outstanding (for diluted EPS). See "Schedule of Non-GAAP Information," for the reconciliation of net income attributable to Invesco Ltd. to adjusted net income attributable to Invesco Ltd.. 34 Table of Contents Investment Capabilities Performance Overview Invesco's first strategic objective is to achieve strong investment performance over the long-term for our clients. As of December 31, 2017 , 57% , 64% and 75% of measured ranked actively managed assets performed in the top half of peer groups on a one-year, three-year and five-year basis respectively. The table below presents the one-, three- and five-year performance of our measured ranked actively managed investment products measured by the percentage of AUM ahead of benchmark and AUM in the top half of peer group.

Peer group rankings are sourced from a widely-used third party ranking agency in each fund's market (Lipper, Morningstar, IA, Russell, Mercer, eVestment Alliance, SITCA, Value Research) and are asset-weighted in USD. Rankings are as of prior quarter-end for most institutional products and preceding month-end for Australian retail funds due to their late release by third parties. Rankings for the most representative fund in each Global Investment Performance Standard (GIPS) composite are applied to all products within each GIPS composite. Excludes passive products, closed-end funds, private equity limited partnerships, non-discretionary direct real estate, unit investment trusts, fund-of-funds with component funds managed by Invesco, stable value building block funds and CLOs. Certain funds and products were excluded from the analysis because of limited benchmark or peer group data. Had these been available, results may have been different. These results are preliminary and subject to revision. Performance assumes the reinvestment of dividends. Past performance is not indicative of future results and may not reflect an investor's experience. 35 Table of Contents Foreign Exchange Impact on Balance Sheet, Assets Under Management and Results of Operations A significant portion of our business is based outside of the U.S. The strengthening or weakening of the U.S. Dollar against other currencies, primarily the Pound Sterling, Canadian Dollar, Euro and Japanese Yen will impact our assets, liabilities, AUM and reported revenues and expenses from period to period. The assets, liabilities and AUM of foreign subsidiaries are translated at period end spot foreign currency exchange rates. The income statements of foreign currency subsidiaries are translated into U.S. Dollars, the reporting currency of the company, using average foreign exchange rates. The table below sets forth the spot foreign exchange rates used for translation of non-U.S. Dollar denominated asset, liabilities and AUM into U.S. Dollars: Spot Foreign Exchange Rates December 31, 2017 December 31, 2016 December 31, 2015 Pound Sterling ($ per ) 1.353 1.236 1.474 Canadian Dollar (CAD per $) 1.253 1.341 1.389 Japan ( per $) 112.645 116.600 120.275 Euro ($ per Euro) 1.201 1.054 1.086 The table below sets forth the average foreign exchange rates used for translation of non-U.S. Dollar denominated income, including revenues and expenses, into U.S. Dollars: Years ended December 31, Average Foreign Exchange Rates 2017 2016 2015 Pound Sterling ($ per ) 1.288 1.356 1.528 Canadian Dollar (CAD per $) 1.297 1.324 1.276 Japan ( per $) 112.137 108.517 121.014 Euro ($ per Euro) 1.129 1.107 1.110 A comparison of period end spot rates between December 31, 2017 and December 31, 2016 shows a strengthening of the Pound Sterling, the Euro, Canadian Dollar and Japanese Yen relative to the U.S. Dollar, which is reflected in the translation of our Pound Sterling-based, Euro-based, Canadian Dollar-based and Japanese Yen-based assets, liabilities and AUM into U.S. Dollars, respectively. A comparison of period end spot rates between December 31, 2016 and December 31, 2015 shows a weakening of the Pound Sterling and the Euro relative to the U.S. Dollar, which is reflected in the translation of our Pound Sterling-based and Euro assets, liabilities and AUM into U.S. Dollars. Over the same period, the Canadian Dollar and Japanese Yen have strengthened relative to the U.S. Dollar, which is reflected in the translation of our Canadian Dollar-based and Japanese Yen-based assets, liabilities and AUM into U.S. Dollars, respectively. A comparison of the average foreign exchange rates used for the year ended December 31, 2017 when compared to the year ended December 31, 2016 shows a weakening of the Pound Sterling and the Japanese Yen relative to the U.S. Dollar, which is reflected in the translation of our Pound Sterling-based and Japanese Yen-based revenue and expenses into U.S. Dollars. Over the same period, the Canadian Dollar and Euro strengthened, which is reflected in the translation of our Canadian Dollar-based and Euro-based revenue and expenses into U.S. Dollars, respectively. A comparison of the average foreign exchange rates used for the year ended December 31, 2016 when compared to the year ended December 31, 2015 shows a significant weakening of the Pound Sterling relative to the U.S. Dollar, together with a weakening of the Canadian Dollar relative to the U.S. Dollar which is reflected in the translation of our Pound Sterling-based and Canadian Dollar-based revenue and expenses into U.S. Dollars. Over the same period, the Japanese Yen strengthened significantly relative to the U.S. Dollar, which was reflected in the translation of our Japanese Yen-based revenue and expenses into U.S. Dollars, respectively. The Euro exchange rate was very similar across the two periods. 36 Table of Contents Assets Under Management The following presentation and discussion of AUM includes Passive and Active AUM. Passive AUM includes ETFs, unit investment trusts (UITs), certain non-fee earning leverage and other passive mandates. Active AUM is total AUM less Passive AUM. The AUM tables and the discussion below refer to AUM as long-term. As of December 31, 2017, the company changed the presentation of long-term inflows, outflows and AUM to exclude UITs and product leverage. Non-management fee earning AUM now includes Invesco PowerShares QQQ, UITs and product leverage. In the AUM tables below, all periods have been reclassified to conform to the new presentation. The net flows in non-management fee earning AUM can be relatively short-term in nature and, due to the relatively low revenue yield, these can have a significant impact on overall net revenue yield. All periods have been reclassified to conform to the new presentation. Long-term inflows and the underlying reasons for the movements in this line item include investments from new clients, existing clients adding new accounts/funds or contributions/subscriptions into existing accounts/funds, and new funding commitments into private equity funds. Beginning with the six months ended December 31, 2017, reinvested dividends and capital gains are included in long-term inflows to be consistent with general industry practice. For previous periods, reinvested dividends and capital gains were included in market gains and losses. Long-term outflows reflect client redemptions from accounts/funds and include the return of invested capital on the maturity or liquidation of private equity funds. We present net flows into institutional money market funds separately because shareholders of those funds typically use them as short-term funding vehicles and because their flows are particularly sensitive to short-term interest rate movements. Changes in AUM were as follows : 2017 2016 2015 $ in billions Total AUM Active Passive Total AUM Active Passive Total AUM Active Passive January 1 812.9 668.5 144.4 775.6 636.5 139.1 792.4 651.0 141.4 Long-term inflows (1) 190.3 147.4 42.9 177.8 141.9 35.9 178.4 153.6 24.8 Long-term outflows (178.8 ) (140.6 ) (38.2 ) (161.3 ) (135.0 ) (26.3 ) (161.8 ) (139.5 ) (22.3 ) Long-term net flows 11.5 6.8 4.7 16.5 6.9 9.6 16.6 14.1 2.5 Net flows in non-management fee earning AUM 3.0 3.0 (6.4 ) (6.4 ) (2.2 ) (2.2 ) Net flows in institutional money market funds (3.2 ) (3.2 ) 12.8 13.1 (0.3 ) (11.9 ) (12.3 ) 0.4 Total net flows 11.3 3.6 7.7 22.9 20.0 2.9 2.5 1.8 0.7 Market gains and losses (1) 66.0 45.4 20.6 37.7 32.1 5.6 (2.6 ) (0.3 ) (2.3 ) Acquisitions/dispositions, net 26.0 26.0 (1.2 ) 2.0 (3.2 ) (0.7 ) (0.7 ) Foreign currency translation 21.4 21.1 0.3 (22.1 ) (22.1 ) (16.0 ) (16.0 ) December 31 937.6 738.6 199.0 812.9 668.5 144.4 775.6 636.5 139.1 Average AUM Average long-term AUM 721.5 632.6 88.9 652.1 586.9 65.2 650.2 587.5 62.7 Average AUM 875.0 705.3 169.7 788.8 653.4 135.4 794.7 653.6 141.1 Revenue yield Gross revenue yield on AUM (2) 59.6 70.1 16.3 60.7 70.3 15.3 65.0 75.9 14.5 Gross revenue yield on AUM before performance fees (2) 58.2 68.5 16.3 60.2 69.6 15.3 63.9 74.6 14.5 Net revenue yield on AUM (3) 42.9 49.3 16.3 43.0 48.8 15.3 45.8 52.6 14.5 Net revenue yield on AUM before performance fees (3) 41.5 47.6 16.3 42.4 48.1 15.3 44.6 51.0 14.5 (1) For the six months ended December 31, 2017, reinvested dividends and capital gains of $7.0 billion are included in long-term inflows. For previous periods, reinvested dividends and capital gains are included in market gains and losses. (2) Gross revenue yield on AUM is equal to annualized total operating revenues divided by average AUM, excluding joint venture (JV) AUM. Our share of the average AUM in 2017 for our JVs in China was $8.5 billion ( 2016 : $9.2 billion , 2015 : $6.1 billion ). It is appropriate to exclude the average AUM of our JVs for purposes of computing gross revenue yield on AUM, because the revenues resulting from these 37 Table of Contents AUM are not presented in our operating revenues. Under U.S. GAAP, our share of the net income of the JVs is recorded as equity in earnings of unconsolidated affiliates on our Consolidated Statements of Income. Additionally, the numerator of the gross revenue yield measure, operating revenues, excludes the management fees earned from CIP; however, the denominator of the measure includes the AUM of these investment products. Therefore, the gross revenue yield measure is not considered representative of the company's true effective fee rate from AUM. (3) Net revenue yield on AUM is equal to annualized net revenues divided by average AUM. See Schedule of Non-GAAP Information for a reconciliation of operating revenues to net revenues. Flows There are numerous drivers of AUM inflows and outflows, including individual investor decisions to change investment preferences, fiduciaries and other gatekeepers making broad asset allocation decisions on behalf of their clients and reallocation of investments within portfolios. We are not a party to these asset allocation decisions, as the company does not generally have access to the underlying investor's decision-making process, including their risk appetite or liquidity needs. Therefore, the company is not in a position to provide meaningful information regarding the drivers of inflows and outflows. AUM at December 31, 2017 wer e $937.6 billion ( December 31, 2016 : $812.9 billion ; December 31, 2015 : $775.6 billion ). During the year ended December 31, 2017 , long-term net inflows and net inflows in non-management fee earning AUM increased AUM by $11.5 billion and $3.0 billion respectively, offset by net outflows of institutional money market funds of $3.2 billion . For the six months ended December 31, 2017 , long-term net inflows included an inflow of $7.0 billion related to reinvested dividends and capital gains. For previous periods, reinvested dividends and capital gains are included in market gains and losses. During the year ended December 31, 2016 , long-term net inflows and net inflows of institutional money market funds increased AUM by $16.5 billion and $12.8 billion , respectively, offset by net outflows in non-management fee earning AUM of $6.4 billion . During the year ended December 31, 2015 , long-term net inflows increased AUM by $16.6 billion , offset by net outflows in institutional money market funds of $11.9 billion and net outflows in non-management fee earning AUM of $2.2 billion . Net inflows during the year ended December 31, 2017 included long-term net active inflows of $6.8 billion and net inflows of passive AUM of $4.7 billion . L ong-term net inflows included net inflows from our retail distribution channel o f $12.4 billion and net outflows from our institutional distribution channel of $0.9 billion . By asset class, long-term net flows were positive for the fixed income, balanced and alternatives classes, and were negative for the equity asset class. Long-term net inflows included $12.8 billion and $1.3 billion from clients domiciled in Continental Europe and Asia, respectively, offset by long-term net outflows of $1.3 billion , $1.0 billion and $0.3 billion from clients domiciled in the U.K., U.S., and Canada, respectively. Net inflows during the year ended December 31, 2016 included long-term net active inflows of $6.9 billion and net inflows of passive AUM of $9.6 billion . Long-term net inflows were split between our institutional distribution channel of $12.1 billion and our retail distribution channel of $4.4 billion . By asset class, long-term net flows were positive for the fixed income and alternatives classes, and were negative for the equity and balanced asset classes. Long-term net inflows included $15.5 billion and $5.9 billion from clients domiciled in Asia and the U.S., respectively, offset by long-term net outflows of $3.3 billion , $1.1 billion and $0.5 billion from clients domiciled in Continental Europe, Canada and the U.K., respectively. Net inflows during the year ended December 31, 2015 included long-term net inflows of active AUM of $14.1 billion and passive AUM of $2.5 billion . Net flows in 2015 were split between net inflows of $14.1 billion into our institutional distribution channel and $2.5 billion into our retail distribution channel. Average AUM during the year ended December 31, 2017 were $875.0 billion , compared to $788.8 billion for the year ended December 31, 2016 a nd $794.7 billion fo r the year ended December 31, 2015 . Market Returns Market gains and losses include the net change in AUM resulting from changes in market values of the underlying securities from period to period. As discussed in the Executive Overview section of this Management Discussion and Analysis, during 2017 , global markets saw strong returns for the year. See below for a discussion of the impact of foreign exchange rates on AUM. During the year ended December 31, 2017 , positive market movement increased AUM by $66.0 billion , w ith gains in all asset classes, with the most significant gains arising from the equity asset class. During the year ended December 31, 2016 , positive market movement increased AUM by $37.7 billion , with gains in each asset asset class, most significantly from the equity asset class. During the year ended December 31, 2015 , negative market movement decreased AUM by $2.6 billion , with declines in the alternatives, fixed income and balanced asset classes, partially offset by gains in the equity asset class. 38 Table of Contents Foreign Exchange Rates During the year ended December 31, 2017 , we experienced increases in AUM of $ 21.4 billion due to changes in foreign exchange rates ( December 31, 2016 : AUM decreased by $22.1 billion ; December 31, 2015 : AUM decreased by $16.0 billion ). See the company's disclosures regarding the changes in foreign exchange rates in the Foreign Exchange Impact on Balance Sheet, Assets Under Management and Results of Operations section above for additional information regarding the movement of foreign exchange rates. Acquisitions and Dispositions During the year ended December 31, 2017 , we completed the acquisition of the European ETF business, which added $26.0 billion in passive ETF AUM (including approximately $7 billion of externally managed AUM) at date of purchase. For the year ended December 31, 2016 , dispositions of $2.7 billion related to the deconsolidation of certain securitization trusts by Invesco Mortgage Capital Inc. (IVR) and other AUM dispositions were partially offset by the acquisition of the controlling interest of Invesco Asset Management (India) Private Limited, which added $2.4 billion to AUM. For the year ended December 31, 2015 , dispositions resulted in a $0.7 billion decrease in AUM, representing exchange traded notes that did not transfer over as part of the agreement with Deutsche Bank to transition the investment management of the PowerShares DB suite of commodity exchange traded funds to Invesco. Revenue Yield Gross revenue yield on AUM decreased 1.1 basis points to 59.6 basis points in the year ended December 31, 2017 from the year ended December 31, 2016 level of 60.7 basis points ( December 31, 2015 : 65.0 basis points). Management does not consider gross revenue yield, the most comparable U.S. GAAP-based measure to net revenue yield, to be a meaningful effective fee rate measure for the reasons outlined in footnote 3 to the Changes in AUM table above. See Schedule of Non-GAAP Information for a reconciliation of operating revenues (gross revenues) to net revenues. Net revenue yield on AUM decreased 0.1 basis point to 42.9 basis points in the year ended December 31, 2017 from the year ended December 31, 2016 level of 43.0 basis points ( December 31, 2015 : 45.8 basis points). Excluding performance fees, the net revenue yield decreased 0.9 basis points to 41.5 basis points in the year ended December 31, 2017 from the year ended December 31, 2016 level of 42.4 basis points ( December 31, 2015 : 44.6 basis points). Changes in our AUM mix can significantly impact our net revenue yield. Passive AUM generally earn a lower effective fee rate than active asset classes. At December 31, 2017 , Passive AUM were $199.0 billion , representing 21.2% of total AUM at that date; whereas at December 31, 2016 , Passive AUM were $144.4 billion , representing 17.8% of our total AUM at that date. This proportional increase in Passive AUM correlates with the decline in net revenue yield in 2017 when compared to 2016 . The acquisition of the European ETF business in the third quarter of 2017 increased the level of passive AUM and has a dilutive impact on the company's overall net revenue yield. The anticipated acquisition of the Guggenheim ETF business in the second quarter of 2018 will increase Passive balances and will have a further dilutive impact on the company's overall net revenue yield. Passive AUM also increased due to non-management fee earning AUM, which increased to $87.8 billion at December 31, 2017 compared to $71.3 billion at December 31, 2016 ( $78.1 billion at December 31, 2015 ). In the year ended December 31, 2017 , the net revenue yield on Passive AUM was 16.3 basis points compared to 15.3 basis points in the year ended December 31, 2016 , an increase of 1.0 basis points, due to changes in mix of Passive AUM. Additionally, as a significant proportion of our AUM is based outside of the U.S., changes in foreign exchange rates result in a change to the mix of U.S. Dollar denominated AUM with AUM denominated in other currencies. As fee rates differ across geographic locations, changes to exchange rates have an impact on the net revenue yields. See the company's disclosures regarding the changes in foreign exchange rates in the Foreign Exchange Impact on Balance Sheet, Assets Under Management and Results of Operations section above for additional information regarding the movement of foreign exchange rates. 39 Table of Contents Changes in our AUM by channel, asset class, and client domicile, and average AUM by asset class, are

See Schedule of Non-GAAP Information for additional important disclosures regarding the use of net revenues. Operating revenues increased by 9.0% in the year ended December 31, 2017 to $5,160.3 million (year ended December 31, 2016 : $4,734.4 million ). Net revenues increased by 10.7% in the year ended December 31, 2017 to $3,754.9 million (year ended December 31, 2016 : $3,393.2 million ). Operating revenues decreased by 7.6% in the year ended December 31, 2016 to $ 4,734.4 million (year ended December 31, 2015 : $ 5,122.9 million ). Net revenues decreased by 6.9% in the year ended December 31, 2016 to $3,393.2 million (year ended December 31, 2015 : $3,643.2 million ). The impact of foreign exchange rate movements decreased operating revenues by $35.3 million , equivalent to 0.7% of total operating revenues, during the year ended December 31, 2017 when compared to the year ended December 31, 2016 ($136.8 million decrease in 2016 as compared to 2015 , or 2.9% of 2016 total operating revenues). Additionally, our revenues are directly influenced by the level and composition of our AUM. Therefore, movements in global capital market levels, net new business inflows (or outflows) and changes in the mix of investment products between asset classes and geographies may materially affect our revenues from period to period. Market movements are discussed in the "Executive Overview" section of this Management's Discussion and Analysis. During 2017 foreign exchange rate changes and net market gains resulted in a 10.9% increase in average AUM when compared to 2016 . 46 Table of Contents See Item 8., Financial Statements and Supplementary Data, Note 1, "Accounting Policies -- Revenue Recognition" for more information regarding the components of each operating revenue category as well as third party distribution, service and advisory expenses. Investment Management Fees Investment management fees increased by $353.5 million ( 9.4% ) in the year ended December 31, 2017 , to $4,126.6 million (year ended December 31, 2016 : $3,773.1 million ).

The impact of foreign exchange rate movements decreased investment management fees by $36.4 million during the year ended December 31, 2017 as compared to the year ended December 31, 2016 . After allowing for foreign exchange movements, investment management fees increased by $389.9 million. In addition to foreign exchange rate movements, the change in product mix of AUM results in changes in the average revenue yield derived from AUM due to differing fee rates and structures, which impacts our management fees. Investment management fees in 2017 also include incremental management fees from the acquisition of the European ETF business. Investment management fees decreased by $288.0 million ( 7.1% ) in the year ended December 31, 2016 , to $ 3,773.1 million (year ended December 31, 2015 : $ 4,061.1 million ).

The im pact of foreign exchange rate movements decreased investment management fees by $133.9 million during the year ended December 31, 2016 as compared to the year ended December 31, 2015 . The strengthening of the U.S. Dollar against the Pound Sterling and Euro has reduced the weighting of higher fee earning AUM attributable to the U.K. and Continental European products in 2016 when compared to 2015. After allowing for foreign exchange movements, investment management fees decreased by $154.1 million. See the company's disclosures regarding the changes in AUM and revenue yields during the years ended December 31, 2017 , December 31, 2016 and December 31, 2015 in the Assets Under Management section above for additional information regarding the movements in AUM.

The increase relates to increases in AUM that earn these fees and the full year impact of fee revenue from the CollegeBound 529 plan which was funded in July 2016. In the year ended December 31, 2016 , service and distribution fees decreased b y $31.8 million ( 3.7% ) to $ 823.6 million (year ended December 31, 2015 : $ 855.4 million ).

The decrease relates to decreases in AUM that earn these fees. Performance Fees In the year ended December 31, 2017 , performance fees increased by $69.0 million ( 155.8% ) to $113.3 million (year ended December 31, 2016 : $44.3 million ).

These decreases include the continued impact of the transition to clean share classes, as investors move into share classes that do not pay distribution fees. The decreases are partially offset by an increase in asset and sales based fees of $13.1 million. Proportional share of revenues, net of third-party distribution expenses, from joint venture investments Management believes that the addition of our proportional share of revenues, net of third-party distribution expenses, from joint venture arrangements should be added to operating revenues to arrive at net revenues, as it is important to evaluate the contribution to the business that our joint venture arrangements are making. See Schedule of Non-GAAP Information for additional disclosures regarding the use of net revenues. The company's most significant joint venture arrangement is our 49% investment in Invesco Great Wall Fund Management Company Limited (the Invesco Great Wall joint venture). Our proportional share of revenues, net of third-party distribution expenses, from joint venture investments increased by $5.0 million ( 11.4% ) to $48.7 million for the year ended December 31, 2017 (year ended December 31, 2016 : $43.7 million ) primarily due to changes in asset classes which resulted in higher yield. Our share of the Invesco Great Wall joint venture's average AUM for the year ended December 31, 2017 was $8.5 billion compared to $9.2 billion for the year ended December 31, 2016 . Our proportional share of revenues, net of third-party distribution expenses, from joint venture investments decreased by $17.3 million (28.4%) to $43.7 million for the year ended December 31, 2016 (year ended December 31, 2015 : $61.0 million). Our share 48 Table of Contents of the Invesco Great Wall joint venture's average AUM for the year ended December 31, 2016 , which was $9.2 billion , compared to $6.1 billion at the year ended December 31, 2015 . Although average AUM has increased in the period, changes in the mix of these AUM from higher fee-based equity AUM into lower fee-based fixed income and other AUM have resulted in a decrease in our proportional share of revenues. Management, performance and other fees earned from CIP Management believes that the consolidation of investment products may impact a reader's analysis of our underlying results of operations and could result in investor confusion or the production of information about the company by analysts or external credit rating agencies that is not reflective of the underlying results of operations and financial condition of the company. Accordingly, management believes that it is appropriate to adjust operating revenues for the impact of CIP in calculating net revenues. As management and performance fees earned by Invesco from the consolidated products are eliminated upon consolidation of the investment products, management believes that it is appropriate to add these operating revenues back in the calculation of net revenues. See Schedule of Non-GAAP Information for additional disclosures regarding the use of net revenues. The elimination of management and performance fees earned from CIP increased by $10.1 million to $32.4 million in the year ended December 31, 2017 (year ended December 31, 2016 : $22.3 million ). The increase is primarily due to the increase in management fees earned from CLOs. The elimination of management and performance fees earned from CIP decreased by $16.9 million to $22.3 million in the year ended December 31, 2016 (year ended December 31, 2015 : $39.2 million ). The decrease is primarily due to the adoption of ASU 2015-02, which resulted in the deconsolidation of certain VIEs (see Note 1, Accounting Policies, for the impact upon adoption), partially offset by the impact of newly consolidated funds, and decreased performance fees earned from CIP in the period.

Operating Income, Adjusted Operating Income, Operating Margin and Adjusted Operating Margin Operating income increased by $100.7 million ( 8.6% ) to $1,277.1 million in the year ended December 31, 2017 (year ended December 31, 2016 : $1,176.4 million ). Operating margin (operating income divided by operating revenues), slightly decreased to 24.7% in the year ended December 31, 2017 from 24.8% in the year ended December 31, 2016 . Adjusted operating income, increased by $167.4 million ( 12.8% ) to $1,480.2 million in the year ended December 31, 2017 from $1,312.8 million in the year ended December 31, 2016 . Adjusted operating margin increased to 39.4% in the year ended December 31, 2017 from 38.7% in the year ended December 31, 2016 . See Schedule of Non-GAAP Information for a reconciliation of operating revenues to net revenues, a reconciliation of operating income to adjusted operating income and additional important disclosures regarding net revenues, adjusted operating income and adjusted operating margin. Operating income decreased by $ 182.0 million ( 13.4% ) to $ 1,176.4 million in the year ended December 31, 2016 (year ended December 31, 2015 : $ 1,358.4 million ). Operating margin (operating income divided by operating revenues), decreased to 24.8% in the year ended December 31, 2016 from 26.5% in the year ended December 31, 2015 . Adjusted operating income decreased by $180.9 million ( 12.1% ) to $1,312.8 million in the year ended December 31, 2016 from $1,493.7 million in the year ended December 31, 2015 . Adjusted operating margin decreased to 38.7% in the year ended December 31, 2016 from 41.0% in the year ended December 31, 2015 . Other Income and Expenses The main categories of other income and expenses, and the dollar and percentage changes between periods are as follows: Variance Years ended December 31, 2017 vs 2016 2016 vs 2015 $ in millions 2017 2016 2015 $ Change % Change $ Change % Change Equity in earnings of unconsolidated affiliates 44.7 9.3 35.1 35.4 380.6 % (25.8 ) (73.5 )% Interest and dividend income 13.4 12.2 13.0 1.2 9.8 % (0.8 ) (6.2 )% Interest expense (94.8 ) (93.4 ) (81.7 ) (1.4 ) 1.5 % (11.7 ) 14.3 % Other gains and losses, net 51.5 22.9 (1.5 ) 28.6 124.9 % 24.4 N/A Other income/(expense) of CIP, net 137.3 79.2 27.1 58.1 73.4 % 52.1 192.3 % Other income/(expense) of CSIP, net 11.7 % (11.7 ) (100.0 )% Total other income and expenses 152.1 30.2 3.7 121.9 403.6 % 26.5 716.2 % Equity in earnings of unconsolidated affiliates Equity in earnings of unconsolidated affiliates increased by $35.4 million ( 380.6% ) to $44.7 million in the year ended December 31, 2017 (year ended December 31, 2016 : $9.3 million ) primarily due to a non-cash impairment charge of $17.8 million related to our investment in an Indian joint venture recorded in 2016. The remaining increase in equity in earnings is driven by an $8.3 million increase in earnings from our investments in real estate products and an increase of $6.0 million from our private equity investments. Equity in earnings of unconsolidated affiliates decreased by $25.8 million ( 73.5% ) to $9.3 million in the year ended December 31, 2016 (year ended December 31, 2015 : $35.1 million ). On April 5, 2016, the company purchased the remaining 51% of Invesco Asset Management (India) Private Limited (formerly our joint venture, Religare Invesco Asset Management Company), which increased our interest to 100%. The company recorded a non-cash impairment charge of $17.8 million related to its 49% investment in its Indian joint venture. The charge related entirely to the devaluation of the Indian Rupee against the U.S. Dollar over the period since the 2013 purchase and is reflected in this line item. The remaining decrease in equity in earnings is driven by decreases of $8.8 million in our share of earnings from our joint venture investments in China and $2.3 million in earnings from our investments in private equity and other funds, partially offset by an increase of $3.1 million in earnings from our investment in Invesco Mortgage Capital Inc. 52 Table of Contents Interest expense Interest expense increased b y $11.7 million (14.3%) to $93.4 million in the year ended December 31, 2016 (year ended December 31, 2015 : $81.7 million ) primarily due to the new Senior Notes issued in October 2015 and t he renegotiation of the credit facility which increased the overall borrowing costs versus the comparative period. Other gains and losses, net Other gains and losses, net were a net gain of $51.5 million in the year ended December 31, 2017 as compared to a net gain of $22.9 million in the year ended December 31, 2016 . Included within other gains and losses, net in the year ended December 31, 2017 are a realized gain of $12.1 million related to revaluation of Euros held in the U.K. in anticipation of payment for the European ETF business acquisition, net trading gains of $24.7 million on the appreciation of investments and the total return swap held for our deferred compensation plans, $14.2 million of net investment gains related to the mark-to-market on our trading investments, $7.2 million of realized gains from available-for-sale investments, a gain of $7.6 million related to an acquisition-related change in the fair value of a contingent consideration liability, net foreign exchange gains on intercompany loans of $4.1 million and $5.8 million of other realized gains. These gains were partially offset by net losses during the period of $21.0 million related to the mark-to-market of foreign exchange put option contracts intended to provide protection against the impact of a significant decline in the Pound Sterling/U.S. Dollar and Euro/U.S. Dollar foreign exchange rates and an investment impairment charge of $3.2 million. See Item 8, Financial Statements and Supplementary Data, - Note 14 , "Other Gains and Losses, Net" for additional information. Other gains and losses, net were a net gain of $22.9 million in the year ended December 31, 2016 as compared to a net loss of $1.5 million in the year ended December 31, 2015 . Included within other gains and losses, net in the year ended December 31, 2016 are a gain of $22.0 million related to the mark-to-market of foreign exchange put option contracts intended to provide protection against the impact of a significant decline in the Pound Sterling/U.S Dollar foreign exchange rate, a net gain of $11.2 million resulting from the appreciation of investments held for our deferred compensation plans and net gains of $3.0 million from other trading investments. These gains are partially offset by a net loss of $7.4 million related to an acquisition related change in the fair value of the contingent consideration liability and $6.0 million in net foreign exchange losses on the revaluation of intercompany foreign currency denominated loans into the various functional currencies of our subsidiaries. See Item 8, Fi nancial Statements and Supplementary Data, - Note 14 , "Other Gains and Losses, Net" for additional information. Other income/(expense) of CIP Upon adoption of ASU 2015-02, the funds previously consolidated as CSIP became VIEs and are now consolidated as CIP. See Item 8, Financial Statements and Supplementary Data - Notes 1 , "Accounting Policies" for additional details. In the year ended December 31, 2017 , interest and dividend income of CIP increased by $16.3 million ( 8.3% ) to $211.6 million (year ended December 31, 2016 : $195.3 million ). Interest expense of CIP increased by $31.8 million ( 25.7% ) to $155.3 million (year ended December 31, 2016 : $123.5 million ). The increase in interest income and interest expense of CIP in the year ended December 31, 2017 is primarily due to the impact of newly consolidated CLOs and other funds during the year. In the year ended December 31, 2016 , interest and dividend income of CIP decreased by $57.7 million ( 22.8% ) to $195.3 million (year ended December 31, 2015 : $253.0 million ). Interest expense of CIP decreased by $65.4 million ( 34.6% ) to $123.5 million (year ended December 31, 2015 : $188.9 million ). The decrease in interest income and interest expense of CIP in the year ended December 31, 2016 is primarily due to the impact of deconsolidation of CLOs upon adoption of ASU 2015-02, partially offset by the impact of newly consolidated CLOs and other funds during 2016. Included in other gains/(losses) of CIP, net, are realized and unrealized gains and losses on the underlying investments and debt of CIP. In the year ended December 31, 2017 , other gains and losses of CIP were a net gain of $81.0 million , as compared to a net gain of $7.4 million in the year ended December 31, 2016 . The net gains during 2017 were attributable to market-driven gains of investments held by consolidated funds. In the year ended December 31, 2016 , other gains and losses of CIP were a net gain of $7.4 million , as compared to a net loss of $37.0 million in the year ended December 31, 2015 . 53 Table of Contents Net impact of CIP and related noncontrolling interests in consolidated entities The net impact to net income attributable to Invesco Ltd. in each period primarily represents the changes in the value of the company's holding in its consolidated CLOs, which is reclassified into other gains/(losses) from accumulated other comprehensive income upon consolidation. The consolidation of investment products during the year ended December 31, 2017 resulted in an increase to net income attributable to Invesco Ltd. of $2.3 million (year ended December 31, 2016 : $3.0 million net increase). The consolidation of investment products during the year ended December 31, 2015 resulted in a decrease to net income attributable to Invesco Ltd. of $40.4 million . Noncontrolling interests in consolidated entities represent the profit or loss amounts attributed to third party investors in CIP. The impact of any gains or losses resulting from valuation changes in the investments of non-CLO CIP attributable to the interests of third parties are offset by resulting changes in gains and losses attributable to noncontrolling interests in consolidated entities and therefore do not have a material effect on the financial condition, operating results (including earnings per share), liquidity or capital resources of the company's common shareholders. Similarly, any gains or losses resulting from valuation changes in the investments of CLOs attributable to the interests of third parties are offset by the calculated value of the notes issued by the CLOs (offsetting in other gains/(losses) of CIP) and therefore also do not have a material effect on the financial condition, operating results (including earnings per share), liquidity or capital resources of the company's common shareholders. Additionally, CIP represent less than 1% of the company's AUM. Therefore, the net gains or losses of CIP are not indicative of the performance of the company's aggregate assets under management. Income Before Taxes Total income before taxes includes income/losses of CIP; however, the company's operating revenues earned from CIP are not included in operating revenues under U.S. GAAP, as such operating revenues are eliminated upon consolidation. Therefore, total U.S. and Foreign income before taxes in Item 8. Financial Statements and Supplementary Data, Note 15 , "Taxation,", which includes income/losses from CIP, and U.S. and Foreign operating revenues in Item 8. Financial Statements and Supplementary Data, Note 17 , "Geographic Information.," in which CIP has been eliminated, may not correlate. The table included in the taxation footnote is formatted such that the income of CIP is separately stated so that the impact of CIP is evident. Total U.S. income before taxes increased $98.6 million during the year ended December 31, 2017 to $638.5 million from $539.9 million for the year ended December 31, 2016 and includes U.S. income of CIP of $0.1 million ( December 31, 2016 : $2.4 million ). U.S. income from CIP decreased $2.3 million (95.8%) from 2016 due primarily to the impact of gains on consolidated private equity partnerships. Excluding CIP, U.S. income before taxes in 2017 increased $100.9 million ( 18.8% ) from December 31, 2016 due to a larger increase in U.S. operating revenues than operating expenses. Total Foreign income before taxes increased $124.0 million during the year ended December 31, 2017 to $790.7 million from $666.7 million during the year ended December 31, 2016 and includes foreign income of CIP of $35.9 million ( December 31, 2016 : foreign income of CIP of $14.7 million ). Foreign income from CIP increased $21.2 million due primarily to gains on consolidated funds and the impact of newly consolidated funds in 2017 . Excluding CIP, foreign income increased by $102.8 million ( 15.8% ) from 2016 due to a larger increase in foreign operating revenues and other income than operating expenses. Total U.S. income before taxes decreased $148.0 million to $539.9 million during the year ended December 31, 2016 from $687.9 million during the year ended December 31, 2015 and includes income of CIP of $2.4 million ( December 31, 2015 : $26.0 million ). U.S. income of CIP decreased $23.6 million ( 90.8% ) from 2015 due primarily to the impact of private equity partnerships that were deconsolidated upon the adoption of ASU 2015-02. Excluding CIP, U.S. income before taxes in 2016 decrease d $ 124.4 million ( 18.8% ) from December 31, 2015 du e to a larger decrease in U.S. operating revenues than operating expenses. Total Foreign income before taxes decreased $7.5 million to $666.7 million during the year ended December 31, 2016 from $674.2 million during the year ended December 31, 2015 and includes U.S. income of CIP of $14.7 million ( December 31, 2015 : losses of CIP of $72.1 million ). Excluding CIP, foreign income decreased by $94.3 million (12.6%) from 2015 du e to a larger decrease in foreign operating revenues and other income than operating expenses. 54 Table of Contents Income Tax Expense Our effective tax rate for the year ended December 31, 2017 decreased to 18.8% (year ended December 31, 2016 : 28.0% ). The decrease included a $130.7 million tax benefit (9.3%) related to the revaluation of deferred tax assets and liabilities following the 2017 Tax Act enacted in the United States. The inclusion of income from non-controlling interests decreased our rate period-over-period by 0.2% ( 0.5% decrease to the effective tax rate in 2017 and 0.3% decrease to the effective tax rate in 2016 ). The remainder of the rate movement was primarily due to changes in the mix of pre-tax income. See also Item 8, Financial Statements and Supplementary Data - in Note 15 , "Taxation," for further details and additional discussion on estimated amounts recorded as of December 31, 2017 for the 2017 Tax Act. Our effective tax rate for the year ended December 31, 2016 decreased to 28.0% (year ended December 31, 2015 : 29.2% ). The inclusion of non-controlling interests decreased our effective tax rate period-over-period b y 0.4%. (0.3% decrease to the effective tax rate in 2016 and 0.1% increase to the effective tax rate in 2015). 2016 included a 0.4% rate increase as a result of the non-cash impairment charge related to the 49% investment in Invesco Asset Management (India) Private Limited. 2015 included a 0.2% rate increase as a result of tax legislation changes in New York City net of settlements, a 0.2% increase as a result of regulatory investigation charges and a 0.3% increase relating to unrecognized tax benefits. The remainder of the rate movement was primarily due to changes in the mix of pre-tax income. Schedule of Non-GAAP Information We utilize the following non-GAAP performance measures: net revenue (and by calculation, net revenue yield on AUM), adjusted operating income, adjusted operating margin, adjusted net income attributable to Invesco Ltd. and adjusted diluted earnings per share (EPS). The company believes the adjusted measures provide valuable insight into the company ongoing operational performance and assist in comparisons to its competitors. These measures also assist the company management with the establishment of operational budgets and forecasts and assist the Board of Directors and management of the company in determining incentive compensation decisions. The most directly comparable U.S. GAAP measures are operating revenues (and by calculation, gross revenue yield on AUM), operating income, operating margin, net income attributable to Invesco Ltd. and diluted EPS. Each of these measures is discussed more fully below. The following are reconciliations of operating revenues, operating income (and by calculation, operating margin), and net income attributable to Invesco Ltd. (and by calculation, diluted EPS) on a U.S. GAAP basis to a non-GAAP basis of net revenues, adjusted operating income (and by calculation, adjusted operating margin), and adjusted net income attributable to Invesco Ltd. (and by calculation, adjusted diluted EPS). These non-GAAP measures should not be considered as substitutes for any U.S. GAAP measures and may not be comparable to other similarly titled measures of other companies. Additional reconciling items may be added in the future to these non-GAAP measures if deemed appropriate. The tax effects related to the reconciling items have been calculated based on the tax rate attributable to the jurisdiction to which the transaction relates. Notes to the reconciliations follow the tables.

There is no difference between the calculated earnings per share amounts presented above and the calculated earnings per share amounts under the two class method. (1) Proportional share of net revenues and operating income from joint venture investments The company has two joint venture investments in China. The Invesco Great Wall joint venture is one of the largest Sino-foreign managers of equity products in China, with AUM of approximately $17.4 billion as of December 31, 2017 . The company has a 49% interest in Invesco Great Wall. The company also has a 50% joint venture with Huaneng Capital Services to access private equity investment opportunities in power generation in China through Huaneng Invesco WLR Investment Consulting Company Ltd. Enhancing our operations in China is one effort that we believe could improve our competitive position over time. Accordingly, we believe that it is appropriate to evaluate the contribution of these joint venture investments to the operations of the business. Management believes that the addition of our proportional share of revenues, net of distribution expenses, from our Chinese joint venture investments in the computation of net revenues and the addition of our proportional share of operating income in the related computations of adjusted operating income and adjusted operating margin also provide useful information to investors and other users of the company's Consolidated Financial Statements, as management considers it appropriate to evaluate the contribution of its joint ventures to the operations of the business. It is also consistent with the presentation 56 Table of Contents of AUM and net flows (where our proportional share of the ending balances and related activity are reflected) and therefore provides a more meaningful calculation of net revenue yield on AUM. (2) Third-party distribution, service and advisory expenses Third-party distribution, service and advisory expenses include renewal commissions, management fee rebates and distribution costs (12b-1 and marketing support) paid to brokers and independent financial advisors and other service and administrative fees paid to third parties. See Item 8, Financial Statements and Supplementary Data - Note 1 , "Accounting Policies - Revenue Recognition" for additional details. While the terms used for these types of expenses vary by geography, they are all expense items that are closely linked to the value of AUM and the revenue earned by Invesco from AUM; although, from time-to-time, distribution expenses may include commissions paid in connection with the launch of closed-end funds for which there is no corresponding revenue in the period. Since the company has been deemed to be the principal in the third-party arrangements, the company must reflect these expenses gross of operating revenues under U.S. GAAP. Management believes that the deduction of third-party distribution, service and advisory expenses from operating revenues appropriately reflects the nature of these expenses as being passed through to external parties who perform functions on behalf of, and distribute, the company managed funds. Further, these expenses vary extensively by geography due to the differences in distribution channels. The net presentation assists in identifying the revenue contribution generated by the business, removing distortions caused by the differing distribution channel fees and allowing for a fair comparison with U.S. peer investment managers and within Invesco own investment units. Additionally, management evaluates net revenue yield on AUM, which is equal to net revenues divided by average AUM during the reporting period. This financial measure is an indicator of the basis point net revenues we receive for each dollar of AUM we manage and is useful when evaluating the company performance relative to industry competitors and within the company for capital allocation purposes. (3) CIP See Item 8, Financial Statements and Supplementary Data, Note 19 - Consolidated Investment Products for a detailed analysis of the impact to the company Consolidated Financial Statements from the consolidation of CIP. The reconciling items add back the management and performance fees earned by Invesco from the consolidated products and remove the revenues and expenses recorded by the consolidated products that have been included in the U.S. GAAP Consolidated Statements of Income. Management believes that the consolidation of investment products may impact a reader's analysis of our underlying results of operations and could result in investor confusion or the production of information about the company by analysts or external credit rating agencies that is not reflective of the underlying results of operations and financial condition of the company. Accordingly, management believes that it is appropriate to adjust operating revenues, operating income and net income for the impact of CIP in calculating the respective net revenues, adjusted operating income and adjusted net income. CIP Revenue: Year ended December 31, $ in millions, except per share data 2017 2016 2015 2014 2013 Management fees earned from CIP, eliminated upon consolidation 25.5 20.8 30.7 26.7 27.0 Performance fees earned from CIP, eliminated upon consolidation 6.9 1.5 8.5 9.1 11.3 Other revenues recorded by CIP (0.6 ) (0.4 ) CIP related adjustments in arriving at net revenues 32.4 22.3 39.2 35.2 37.9 (4) Business combination related adjustments Business combination related adjustments are comprised of amounts incurred by the company in connection with business combinations. Management believes it is useful to investors and other users of our Consolidated Financial Statements to adjust for the transaction and integration charges, the reversal of business combination-related deferred tax liabilities recorded under U.S. GAAP, currency gains recognized on revaluation of foreign currencies held in anticipation of payment for acquisition and other acquisition/disposition related adjustments in arriving at adjusted operating income, adjusted operating margin and adjusted diluted EPS, as this will aid comparability of our results period to period, and aid comparability with peer companies that may not have similar acquisition and disposition related income or charges. 57 Table of Contents See table below for a reconciliation of business combination related items: $ in millions 2017 2016 2015 2014 2013 Business combination related: Employee compensation expense (a) 5.8 7.0 2.4 Transaction and integration expense (b) 20.6 1.4 2.2 5.2 Intangible amortization expense (c) 17.4 13.9 10.6 12.6 15.4 Adjustments to operating income 43.8 22.3 12.8 12.6 23.0 Change in contingent consideration estimates (d) (7.6 ) 7.4 (27.1 ) Foreign exchange gain related to business acquisitions (e) (12.1 ) Other-than-temporary impairment (f) 17.8 Taxation: Taxation on employee compensation expense (a) (2.1 ) (2.7 ) Taxation on transaction and integration (b) (5.9 ) (0.5 ) (0.6 ) (2.1 ) Taxation on amortization (c) (1.6 ) (1.3 ) (1.5 ) (1.6 ) (1.5 ) Deferred taxation (g) 19.6 19.3 20.1 21.8 21.3 Taxation on change in contingent consideration estimates (d) 2.9 (2.8 ) 10.3 Taxation on foreign exchange gain related to business acquisitions (e) 2.3 (Income)/loss from discontinued operations, net of taxes (h) 3.4 (64.5 ) Adjustments to net income attributable to Invesco Ltd. 39.3 59.5 14.0 36.2 (23.8 ) ____________ a. Employee compensation expenses o f $5.8 million incurred in 2017 are related to our European ETF acquisition, while $7.0 million incurred in 2016 are associat ed with the acquisition of Jemstep, a market-leading provider of advisor-focused digital solutions. Expenses in 2013 are related to employee severance expenses associated with the cessation of activities from a previous acquisition. b. Transaction and integration expenses reflect the legal, regulatory, advisory, valuation, integration-related employee incentive awards, other professional or consulting fees and general and administrative costs, which includes travel costs related to transactions and the costs of temporary staff involved in executing the transaction, and the post-closing costs of integrating the acquired business into the company existing operations, including incremental costs associated with achieving synergy savings. c. Intangible amortization expense is associated with intangible assets that are identified from acquisition of a business and are amortized on a straight-line basis over useful lives. See Item 8, Financial Statements and Supplementary Data, Note 5 - Intangible Assets for detail. d. During 2015, the company acquired investment management contracts from Deutsche Bank and the purchase price was solely comprised of contingent consideration payable in future periods. Adjustment to the fair value of contingent consideration liability is a decrease of $7.6 million in 2017, an increase of $7.4 million in 2016 and a decrease of $27.1 million in 2015. See Item 8, Financial Statements and Supplementary Data, Note 2 - Fair Value of Assets and Liabilities for detail. e. Other gains and losses for 2017 includes a realized gain of $12.1 million related to revaluation of Euros held in the U.K. in anticipation of payment for the European ETF business acquisition. f. Other-than-temporary impairment includes an impairment charge of $17.8 million in 2016 that is related to the acquisition of Invesco Asset Management (India) Private Limited. g. While finite-lived intangible assets are amortized under U.S. GAAP, there is no amortization charge on goodwill and indefinite-lived intangibles. In certain qualifying situations, these can be amortized for tax purposes, generally over a 15-year period, as is the case in the U.S. These deferred tax liabilities represent tax benefits that are not included in the Consolidated Statements of Income absent an impairment charge or the disposal of the related business. The company receives these tax benefits but does not anticipate a sale or impairment of these assets in the foreseeable 58 Table of Contents future, and therefore the deferred tax liabilities recognized under U.S. GAAP are not expected to be used either through a credit in the Consolidated Statements of Income or through settlement of tax obligations. h. The results of the discontinued operations of Atlantic Trust have been excluded in arriving at adjusted net income attributable to Invesco Ltd., which is the basis of calculating adjusted diluted EPS. Accordingly, the company's non-GAAP financial measures reflect only the continuing business of Invesco. (5) Market movement on deferred compensation plan liabilities Certain deferred compensation plan awards are linked to the appreciation (depreciation) of specified investments, typically managed by the company. Invesco hedges economically the exposure to market movements by holding these investments on its balance sheet and through a total return swap financial instrument. U.S. GAAP requires the appreciation (depreciation) in the compensation liability to be expensed over the award vesting period in proportion to the vested amount of the award as part of compensation expense. The full value of the investment and financial instrument appreciation (depreciation) are immediately recorded below operating income in other gains and losses. This creates a timing difference between the recognition of the compensation expense and the investment gain or loss impacting net income attributable to Invesco Ltd. and diluted EPS which will reverse over the life of the award and net to zero at the end of the multi-year vesting period. During periods of high market volatility these timing differences impact compensation expense, operating income and operating margin in a manner which, over the life of the award, will ultimately be offset by gains and losses recorded below operating income on the Consolidated Statements of Income. The non-GAAP measures exclude the mismatch created by differing U.S. GAAP treatments of the market movement on the liability and the investments. Since these plans are hedged economically, management believes it is useful to reflect the offset ultimately achieved from hedging the investment market exposure in the calculation of adjusted operating income (and by calculation, adjusted operating margin) and adjusted net income (and by calculation, adjusted diluted EPS), to produce results that will be more comparable period to period. The related fund shares will have been purchased on or around the date of grant, eliminating any ultimate cash impact from market movements that occur over the vesting period. Additionally, dividend income from investments held to hedge economically deferred compensation plans is recorded as dividend income and as compensation expense on the company Consolidated Statements of Income on the record dates. This dividend income is passed through to the employee participants in the plan and is not retained by the company. The non-GAAP measures exclude this dividend income and related compensation expense.

Inclusion of this true-up in the company non-GAAP financial information woul d depress the derived metric of net revenue yield on AUM from continuing operations, an important metric calculated 60 Table of Contents from a non-GAAP financial measure which is often contemplated by users of the company financial information to evaluate the company with industry peers. The true-up is not indicative of a trend in future net revenue yield on AUM; therefore, it is not included in management evaluation of the results of the business. On this basis, the amount is added back to management fees to arrive at net revenue. b. European infrastructure transformational initiative: The company outsourced its European transfer agency and made certain structural changes to product and distribution platforms. Expenses incurred related to the European infrastructure activities are excluded in arriving at the non-GAAP financial information. In connection with the initiative, operational process changes resulted in an accounting adjustment recognizing additional distribution expense in the year ended and December 31, 2013. c. Business optimization: Operating expenses for 2017 include costs associated with a business transformation initiative that include severance costs of $30.0 million , and consulting and temporary labor costs of $25.3 million ( 2016 : $26.4 million and $21.8 million , 2015: $12.2 million and $2.0 million , respectively). A separate business optimization location strategy initiative incurred property related charges and/or credits of the following: 2014 : charges of $33.1 million associated with vacating leased properties and severance costs of $7.2 million related to the initiative; 2015: property related charges of $2.0 million and lease credit of $6.4 million ; 2016: property related charges of $1.7 million and lease credit of $3.2 million ; and 2017 : property related charges of $2.7 million . d. Employee benefit plan termination: Operating expenses for 2016 include an incremental credit of $8.6 million related to an employee benefit plan termination . e. General and administrative expenses for 2015 include a provision of $12.6 million pertaining to regulatory actions and related legal fees of $0.5 million ( 2017 : none ; 2016 : $1.0 million ). This includes $7.6 million associated with our private equity business. Operating expenses for 2014 include a charge of $31.1 million (in respect of the penalty under a settlement of an enforcement proceeding reached with the U.K. Financial Conduct Authority (FCA) pertaining to the company's compliance with certain FCA rules and regulations for the period from May 2008 to November 2012). This charge, together with settlement-related legal costs of $0.5 million, has been recorded in general and administrative expense. f. Operating expenses for 2017 reflect the cost of multiple senior executive retirements, including, among others, the former Senior Managing Director of EMEA and the Chairman of our Private Equity business, which resulted in expenses of $19.7 million related to accelerated vesting of deferred compensation and other separation costs. The number of senior executive retirements and magnitude of their retirement costs incurred in one quarter was unprecedented for Invesco. The company deemed it appropriate to adjust these costs from U.S. GAAP total compensation expenses in an effort to isolate and evaluate our level of ongoing compensation expenses and to allow for more appropriate comparisons to internal metrics and with the level of compensation expenses incurred by industry peers. g. General and administrative expenses for 2014 and 2015 include charges of $31.1 million and $4.7 million , respectively, in respect of a multi-year fund reimbursement expense associated with historical private equity management fees. The charge resulted primarily from using a more appropriate methodology regarding the calculation of offsets to management fees. h. Included within general and administrative expenses for 2014 is a credit of $4.7 million related to the partial refund of a $15.3 million levy in 2010 from the U.K. Financial Services Compensation Scheme. An additional $3.0 million charge was recorded in the year ended December 31, 2013 reflecting revised estimates of the levy. i. Property, office and technology expenses includes a charge of $11.7 million in the year ended December 31, 2013 related to the write-off of capitalized IT software development costs. j. Included within other gains and losses, net is the mark-to-market of foreign exchange put option contracts intended to provide protection against the impact of a significant decline in the Pound Sterling/U.S. Dollar and the Euro/U.S. Dollar foreign exchange rates. The Pound Sterling contracts provide coverage through December 31, 2018 and the Euro contracts provided coverage through December 27, 2017. The adjustment from U.S. GAAP to non-GAAP earnings removes the impact of market volatility; therefore, the company's non-GAAP results include only the amortization of the cost of the contracts during the contract period. 61 Table of Contents k. On December 31, 2013 , at the time of creating a new trust company subsidiary to continue operating the company institutional trust activities immediately following the disposition of Atlantic Trust, the company made a $31.9 million payment to a managed investment trust, which resulted in the subsequent termination of an outstanding support agreement. This expense was recorded in other gains/(losses) in the company Consolidated Statement of Income during the year ended December 31, 2013. l. The income tax provision for 2017 includes a retroactive state tax expense of $12.2 million related to 2016 and prior open tax years caused by changes in state tax regulations. 2017 also included a $ 130.7 million tax benefit as a result of the revaluation of deferred tax assets and liabilities following the 2017 Tax Act enacted in the United States. 62 Table of Contents Balance Sheet Discussion Cash and cash equivalents Cash and cash equivalents increased by $678.4 million from $1,328.0 million at December 31, 2016 to $2,006.4 million at December 31, 2017 . See Cash Flows Discussion in the following section within this Management's Discussion and Analysis for additional discussion regarding the movements in cash flows during the periods. See Item 8, Fin ancial Statements and Supplementary Data - Note 1 , Accounting Policies - Cash and Cash Equivalents, regarding requirements to retain liquid resources in certain jurisdictions. Unsettled fund receivables and payables Unsettled fund receivables increased by $120.9 million from $672.9 million at December 31, 2016 to $793.8 million at December 31, 2017 , due primarily to higher transaction activity between funds and investors in late December 2017 when compared to late December 2016 in our U.K. and cross-border funds, offset by lower UIT activity. In our U.K. and cross-border operations, unsettled fund receivables are created by the normal settlement periods on transactions initiated by certain clients. In the company's capacity as sponsor of UITs, the company records receivables from brokers, dealers, and clearing organizations for unsettled sell trades of securities and UITs in addition to receivables from customers for unsettled sell trades of UITs. The presentation of the unsettled fund receivables and substantially offsetting payables ( $783.8 million at December 31, 2017 up from $659.3 million at December 31, 2016 ) at t rade date reflects the legal relationship between the underlying investor and the company. Investments As of December 31, 2017 we had $674.6 million in investments ( December 31, 2016 : $795.3 million ). Included in investments are $243.0 million of seed money investments in affiliated funds used to seed funds as we launch new products, and $92.3 million of investments related to assets held for deferred compensation plans, which are also held primarily in affiliated funds. Seed investments decreased by $6.8 million during the year ended December 31, 2017 . The decrease in the period reflects redemptions of $172.3 million, partially offset by purchases of $58.0 million, a non-cash increase of $80.9 million due to the deconsolidation of certain CIP in the period (restoring the company's formerly eliminated investment balances) as well as an increase of $24.3 million driven by market valuation changes and foreign exchange movements. Investments related to deferred compensation awards decreased by a net $78.2 million during the period, primarily related to the disposition of certain investments held to hedge economically one of the company's deferred compensation plans. Such disposition occurred in conjunction with the entrance by the company into a one-year renewable total return swap to more efficiently hedge this deferred compensation plan. This transaction did not have a material impact to the company's operations or financial position. Included in investments are $277.3 million in equity method investments in our Chinese joint ventures and in certain of the company private equity partnerships, real estate partnerships and other co-investments ( December 31, 2016 : $279.0 million ). The decrease of $1.7 million in equity method investments was driven by capital returns and the consolidation of certain investments during the current period. This decreases were partially offset by current period earnings, capital calls into certain partnership investments and increases due to the changes in foreign exchange rates. Assets held for policyholders and policyholder payables One of our subsidiaries, Invesco Perpetual Life Limited, is an insurance company that was established to facilitate retirement savings plans in the U.K. The entity holds assets that are managed for its clients on its balance sheet with an equal and offsetting liability. The increase in the balance of these accounts from $8,224.2 million at December 31, 2016 , to $12,444.5 million at December 31, 2017 , was the result of new business net inflows of $3,209.5 million and an increase in the market values of these assets and liabilities of $51.1 million and foreign exchange movements of $959.7 million. The new business inflows can be primarily attributed to pension and retirement funds investing into multi-asset products via this insurance company. Intangible assets, net Intangible assets reflect a net increase of $159.3 million from $1,399.4 million at December 31, 2016 , to $1,558.7 million at December 31, 2017 . The increase includes $167.1 million related to the acquisition of the European ETF business, foreign exchange movements of $9.6 million , offset by amortization of $17.4 million . 63 Table of Contents Goodwill Goodwill increased from $6,129.2 million at December 31, 2016 , to $6,590.7 million at December 31, 2017 . The increase consists of $193.3 million related to the acquisition of the European ETF business and foreign exchange movements of $ 268.2 million . See Item 8, Financial Statements and Supplementary Data - Note 6 , "Goodwill," for an analysis of the change in goodwill balances between periods. The company's annual goodwill impairment review is performed as of October 1 of each year. As a result of that analysis, the company determined that no impairment existed at that date. See Critical Accounting Policies - Goodwill for additional details of the company's goodwill impairment analysis process. Long-term debt Long-term debt decreased from $2,102.4 million at December 31, 2016 , to $2,075.8 million at December 31, 2017 , a decrease of $ 26.6 million . As of December 31, 2017 , there was zero outstanding on the credit facility (at December 31, 2016 : $28.7 million ) . Liquidity and Capital Resources Our capital structure, together with available cash balances, cash flows generated from operations, existing capacity under our credit facility and further capital market activities, if necessary, should provide us with sufficient resources to meet present and future cash needs, including operating, debt and other obligations as they come due and anticipated future capital requirements. Material changes in the company's capital structure over the last three years include: 2017: During 2017, Invesco entered into a definitive agreement to acquire Guggenheim Investments' ETF business. The acquisition is expected to close in the second quarter of 2018 for an anticipated purchase price of $1.2 billion. The company expects approximately 80% of the purchase price will be funded through the use of the company existing credit facility with the remainder paid in cash. The company plans to repay the amount borrowed over the course of 2018, returning leverage ratios to pre-acquisition levels, through the curtailment of open market share repurchases. As such, the company has not repurchased common shares in the open market during 2017. Separately, on August 11, 2017 the company amended and restated the existing credit facility agreement increasing the borrowing limit to $1.5 billion and extending the expiration date to August 11, 2022 . On December 22, 2017, the 2017 Tax Act, was signed into law. The 2017 Tax Act, among other items, reduces the federal corporate tax rate from 35% to 21% effective January 1, 2018. Our intention is to use the additional cash flow generated from the lower tax rate first to reduce the anticipated future outstanding balance on the credit facility resulting from the Guggenheim acquisition. After the acquisition is complete and the credit facility balance is reduced, any residual excess will follow our capital management priorities. 2016 : During 2016, we repurchased 18.1 million common sh ares in open market transactions utilizing $535.0 million in cash under the company's board-approved open market share repurchase program. 2015 : During 2015, we repurchased 15.5 million common shares in open market transactions utilizing $548.8 million in cash under the company's board-approved open market share repurchase program. On October 14, 2015, the company completed the issuance of senior notes with aggregate principal amounts of $500 million at 3.750% due January 15, 2026. The proceeds were used, in part, to repay the outstanding balance on the credit facility at that date. Separately, on August 7, 2015, the company amended the existing $1.25 billion credit facility to extend its maturity to August 7, 2020. Our capital management priorities have evolved with the growth and success of our business and include: reinvestment in the business; moderate annual growth of dividends (as further discussed in the "Dividends" section below); share repurchase; and target an approximat e $1 billion cash b uffer in excess of European regulatory and liquidity requirements. These priorities are executed in a manner consistent with our desire to maintain a strong, investment-grade credit rating. As of the filing of this Report, Invesco held credit ratings of A2/Stable, A/Negative and A-/Stable from Moody's, S&P, and Fitch Ratings Fitch, respectively. Our ability to continue to access the capital markets in a timely manner depends on a number of factors, including our credit ratings, the condition of the global economy, investors willingness to purchase our securities, interest rates, 64 Table of Contents credit spreads and the valuation levels of equity markets. If we are unable to access capital markets in a timely manner, our business could be adversely impacted. See also Item 1A - "Ri sk Factors," for more detailed discussion on reliance on credit ratings. Certain of our subsidiaries are required to maintain minimum levels of capital. Such requirements may change from time-to-time as additional guidance is released based on a variety of factors, including balance sheet composition, assessment of risk exposures and governance, and review from regulators. These and other similar provisions of applicable laws and regulations may have the effect of limiting withdrawals of capital, repayment of intercompany loans and payment of dividends by such entities. All of our regulated EU subsidiaries are subject to consolidated capital requirements under EU Directives, including those arising from the EU's Capital Requirements Directive and the U.K.'s Internal Capital Adequacy Assessment Process (ICAAP), and capital is maintained within this sub-group to satisfy these regulations. We meet these requirements in part by holding cash and cash equivalents. This retained cash can be used for general business purposes in the European sub-group in the countries where it is located. Due to the capital restrictions, the ability to transfer cash between certain jurisdictions may be limited. In addition, transfers of cash between international jurisdictions may have adverse tax consequences. We are in compliance with all regulatory minimum net capital requirements. As of December 31, 2017 , the company's minimum regulatory capital requirement was $761.4 million ( December 31, 2016 : $590.8 million ); the increase was driven primarily by the European ETF business acquisition as well the strengthening of the Pound Sterling against the U.S. Dollar. The total amount of non-U.S. cash and cash equivalents was $1,595.6 million at December 31, 2017 ( December 31, 2016 : $1,168.4 million). In addition, the company is required to hold cash deposits with clearing organizations or to otherwise segregate cash to maintain compliance with federal and other regulations in connection with its UIT broker dealer entity. At December 31, 2017 , these cash deposits totaled $11.4 million ( December 31, 2016 : $11.4 million ). The consolidation of $6.3 billion and $4.8 billion of total assets and long-term debt of CIP as of December 31, 2017 , respectively, did not impact the company liquidity and capital resources. The majority of CIP balances related to consolidated CLOs.The collateral assets of the CLOs are held solely to satisfy the obligations of the CLOs. The company has no right to the benefits from, nor does it bear the risks associated with, the collateral assets held by the CLOs, beyond the company direct investments in, and management and performance fees generated from, these products, which are eliminated upon consolidation. If the company were to liquidate, the collateral assets would not be available to the general creditors of the company, and as a result, the company does not consider them to be company assets. Likewise, if the CLOs were to liquidate, their investors would have no recourse to the general credit of the company. The company therefore does not consider this debt to be an obligation of the company. See Item 8, Financial Statements and Supplementary Data - Note 19 , Consolidated Investment Products, for additional details. Cash Flows Discussion The ability to consistently generate free cash flow from operations in excess of dividend payments, share repurchases, capital expenditures, and ongoing operating expenses is one of our company's fundamental financial strengths. Operations continue to be financed from current earnings and borrowings. Our principal uses of cash, other than for operating expenses, include dividend payments, capital expenditures, acquisitions, purchase of our shares in the open market and investments in certain new investment products. Cash flows of CIP (discussed in Item 8, Financial Statements and Supplementary Data - Note 19 , Consolidated Investment Products ) are reflected in Invesco's cash provided by or used in operating activities, investing activities and financing activities. Cash held by CIP is not available for general use by Invesco, nor is Invesco cash available for general use by its CIP. Accordingly, the table below presents the consolidated total cash flows of the company and separately presents the impact to the cash flows from CIP. The impact is illustrated in the tables immediately below by a column which shows the dollar-value change in the consolidated figures, as caused by the consolidation of CIP. For example, the impact of CIP on net cash provided by/(used in) operating activities for the year ended December 31, 2017 reflects cash used of $61.2 million ; however, this was not used as part of the company's corporate cash activities. Excluding the impact of CIP, cash provided by operations was $1,431.9 million for the year ended December 31, 2017 . Also as illustrated in the table below, the sum of the operating, investing and financing cash flows of CIP offsets to a zero impact to the company's change in cash and cash equivalent balances from period to period. The cash flows of CIP do not form part of the company cash flow management processes, nor do they form part of the company significant liquidity evaluations and decisions for the reasons noted. The discussion that follows the table focuses on the company cash flows. 65 Table of Contents Summary of Cash Flow Statement Impact of CIP December 31, 2017 December 31, 2016 December 31, 2015 $ in millions Impact of CIP Invesco Ltd.

During 2017 , cash provided by operating activities increased $1,199.4 million to $1,370.7 million from $171.3 million in 2016 . As shown in the tables above, the impact of CIP to cash provided by operating activities was $61.2 million of cash used during 2017 compared to $714.2 million of cash used during 2016 . Excluding the impact of CIP, cash provided by operations was $1,431.9 million in 2017 compared to $885.5 million in 2016 , an increase of $546.4 million . This increase is larger than the $100.7 million increase in operating income principally due to changes in operating assets and liabilities. Excluding the impact of CIP, the changes in operating assets and liabilities provided $154.5 million of cash in 2017 , as compared to utilizing $201.2 million in the same period in 2016 , increasing cash provided by operating activities by $355.7 million when comparing the two periods. This includes a $59.6 million reduction in payments for annual staff bonuses, related payroll taxes, payroll taxes on annual share award vestings, annual retirement plan contributions, and a $304.2 million decrease in net purchases of trading investments. The increases in receivables and payables, excluding the impact of CIP, of $3,393.4 million and $3,404.4 million , respectively, include increases in our assets held for policyholders and policyholder payables, as discussed in Item 7, Management's Discussion and Analysis -- Balance Sheet Discussion -- "Assets Held for Policyholders and Policyholder Payables" of $3,260.6 million each. Excluding CIP, there were no significant non-cash items that impacted the comparison between the periods of operating income to net cash provided by operations. During 2016 , cash provided by operating activities decreased $957.1 million to $171.3 million from $1,128.4 million in 2015 . As shown in the tables above, the impact of CIP to cash used by operating activities was $714.2 million of cash used during 2016 compared to $23.1 million of cash provided by during 2015 . Excluding the impact of CIP, cash provided by operations was $885.5 million in 2016 compared to $1,105.3 million in 2015 , a decrease of $219.8 million . This decrease is larger than the $182.0 million decrease in operating income principally due to changes in operating assets and liabilities. Excluding the impact of CIP, the changes in operating assets and liabilities utilized $201.2 million of cash in 2016 , as compared to utilizing $129.1 million in the same period in 2015 , reducing cash provided by operating activities by $72.1 million when comparing the two periods. This includes a $27.0 million increase in additional payroll payments related to annual staff bonus, related payroll taxes, payroll taxes on annual share award vestings, and annual retirement plan contributions and a $1.7 million increase in net purchases of trading investments. The increases in receivables and payables, excluding the impact of CIP, of $3,508.8 million and $3,468.3 million , respectively, include increases in our assets held for policyholders and policyholder payables, as discussed in Item 7, Management's Discussion and Analysis -- Balance Sheet Discussion -- "Assets Held for Policyholders and Policyholder Payables" of $3,515.9 million each. Excluding CIP, there were no significant non-cash items that impacted the comparison between the periods of operating income to net cash provided by operations. Investing Activities Net cash used in investing activities totaled $961.1 million for the year ended December 31, 2017 ( 2016 : net cash used $990.6 million ). As shown in the tables above, the impact of CIP on investing activities, including investment purchases, sales and returns of capital, was $685.1 million cash used in 2017 ( 2016 : $737.4 million cash used ). Excluding the impact of CIP cash flows, net cash used in investing activities was $276.0 million ( 2016 : $253.2 million cash used ). For the year ended December 31, 2017 , excluding the impact of CIP, cash outflows include $299.2 million related to the purchase of the European ETF business (twelve months ended December 31, 2016 : $121.9 million related to the purchases of Jemstep and the remaining interest in our Indian joint venture) and purchases of available-for-sale investments and other investments of $262.9 million ( 2016 : $249.6 million ). These outflows were partially offset by collected proceeds of $397.8 million from sales of available-for-sale and other investments combined with returns of capital and distributions from unconsolidated partnerships ( 2016 : $266.0 million ). During the year ended December 31, 2017 , the company had capital expenditures of $111.7 million ( 2016 : $147.7 million ). Our capital expenditures related principally in each period to technology initiatives, including enhancements to platforms from which we maintain our portfolio management systems and fund accounting systems, improvements in computer hardware and software desktop products for employees, new telecommunications products to enhance our internal information flow, and back-up disaster recovery systems. Also, in each period, a portion of these costs related to leasehold improvements made to the various buildings and workspaces used in our offices. These projects have been funded with proceeds from our operating cash flows. 67 Table of Contents Net cash used in investing activities totaled $990.6 million for the year ended December 31, 2016 ( 2015 : net cash used of $664.8 million ).

Dividends Invesco declares and pays dividends on a quarterly basis in arrears. The 2017 quarterly dividend was $0.29 per Invesco Ltd. common share. On January 31, 2018 , the company declared a fourth quarter 2017 cash dividend, which will be paid on March 2, 2018 , to shareholders of record as of February 15, 2018 with an ex-dividend date of February 14, 2018 . The total dividend attributable to the 2017 fiscal year of $1.16 per share represented a 3.6% increase over the total dividend attributable to the 2016 fiscal year of $1.12 per share. The declaration, payment and amount of any future dividends will be declared by our Board of Directors and will depend upon, among other factors, our earnings, financial condition and capital requirements at the time such declaration and payment are considered. The Board has a policy of managing dividends in a prudent fashion, with due consideration given to profit levels, overall debt levels, and historical dividend payouts. 68 Table of Contents Share Repurchase Plan The company did not purchase shares in the open market during the year ended December 31, 2017 (year ended December 31, 2016 : 18.1 million shares at a cost of $535.0 million ). The company did withhold an aggregate of 1.9 million shares on vesting events during the year ended December 31, 2017 to meet employees' withholding tax obligations ( December 31, 2016 : 1.5 million ). The fair value of these shares withheld at the respective withholding dates was $63.8 million ( December 31, 2016 : $42.0 million ). At December 31, 2017 , approximately $1,643.0 million remained authorized under the company's share repurchase authorizations approved by the Board on October 11, 2013 and July 22, 2016 ( December 31, 2016 : $1,643.0 million ). Long-term debt The carrying value of our long-term debt at December 31, 2017 was $ 2,075.8 million ( December 31, 2016 : $ 2,102.4 million ) and was comprised of the following: $ in millions December 31, 2017 December 31, 2016 Floating rate credit facility expiring August 11, 2022 28.7 Unsecured Senior Notes: $600 million 3.125% - due November 30, 2022 596.9 596.3 $600 million 4.000% - due January 30, 2024 594.0 593.2 $500 million 3.750% -- due January 15, 2026 495.1 494.5 $400 million 5.375% - due November 30, 2043 389.8 389.7 Long-term debt 2,075.8 2,102.4 For the year ended December 31, 2017 , the company's weighted average cost of debt was 3.94% (year ended December 31, 2016 : 3.95% ). The unsecured $1.5 billion credit agreement is scheduled to expire on August 11, 2022. Financial covenants under the credit agreement include: (i) the quarterly maintenance of a debt/EBITDA leverage ratio, as defined in the credit agreement, of not greater than 3.25 : 1.00 , (ii) a coverage ratio (EBITDA, as defined in the credit agreement/interest payable for the four consecutive fiscal quarters ended before the date of determination) of not less than 4.00 : 1.00 . As of December 31, 2017 , we were in compliance with our financial covenants. At December 31, 2017 , our leverage ratio was 1.18 :1.00 ( December 31, 2016 : 1.35 :1.00) , and our interest coverage ratio was 18.64 :1.00 ( December 31, 2016 : 16.69 :1.00). The December 31, 2017 and 2016 coverage ratio calculations are as follows: Last four quarters ended $ millions December 31, 2017 December 31, 2016 Net income attributable to Invesco Ltd. 1,127.3 854.2 Impact of CIP on net income attributable to Invesco Ltd.

The calculation of EBITDA above (a reconciliation from net income attributable to Invesco Ltd.) is defined by our credit agreement, and therefore net income attributable to Invesco Ltd. is the most appropriate GAAP measure from which to reconcile to EBITDA. The calculation of Adjusted debt is defined in our credit facility and equals total debt of $2,075.8 million plus $10.6 million in letters of credit. The discussion that follows identifies risks associated with the company's liquidity and capital resources. The Item 1. Business -- Risk Management section contains a broader discussion of the company's overall approach to risk management. Credit and Liquidity Risk Capital management involves the management of the company's liquidity and cash flows. The company manages its capital by reviewing annual and projected cash flow forecasts and by monitoring credit, liquidity and market risks, such as interest rate and foreign currency risks (as discussed in Item 7A, Quantitative and Qualitative Disclosures About Market Risk ), through measurement and analysis. The company is primarily exposed to credit risk through its cash and cash equivalent deposits, which are held by external firms. The company invests its cash balances in its own institutional money market products, as well as with external high credit-quality financial institutions. These arrangements create exposure to concentrations of credit risk. Credit Risk Credit risk is the risk that one party to a financial instrument will cause a financial loss for the other party by failing to meet an obligation. All cash and cash equivalent balances are subject to credit risk, as they represent deposits made by the company with external banks and other institutions. As of December 31, 2017 , our maximum exposure to credit risk related to our cash and cash equivalent balances is $2,006.4 million . See Item 8, Financial Statements and Supplementary Data - No te 20 , R elated Parties, for information regarding cash and cash equivalents invested in affiliated money market funds. The company does not utilize credit derivatives or similar instruments to mitigate the maximum exposure to credit risk. The company does not expect any counterparties to its financial instruments to fail to meet their obligations. Liquidity Risk Liquidity risk is the risk that the company will encounter difficulty in meeting obligations associated with its financial liabilities as the same become due. The company is exposed to liquidity risk through its $2,075.8 million in total debt. The company actively manages liquidity risk by preparing cash flow forecasts for future periods, reviewing them regularly with senior management, maintaining a committed credit facility, scheduling significant gaps between major debt maturities and engaging external financing sources in regular dialogue. Effects of Inflation Inflation can impact our organization primarily in two ways. First, inflationary pressures can result in increases in our cost structure, especially to the extent that large expense components such as compensation are impacted. To the degree that these expense increases are not recoverable or cannot be counterbalanced through pricing increases due to the competitive environment, our profitability could be negatively impacted. Secondly, the value of the assets that we manage may be negatively impacted when inflationary expectations result in a rising interest rate environment. Declines in the values of these AUM could lead to reduced revenues as management fees are generally calculated based upon the size of AUM. Off Balance Sheet Commitments See Item 8, Financial Statements and Supplementary Data - Note 18 , Commitments and Contingencies - Off Balance Sheet Commitments, for more information regarding undrawn capital commitments. 70 Table of Contents Contractual Obligations We have various financial obligations that require future cash payments. The following table outlines the timing of payment requirements related to our commitments as of December 31, 2017 : $ in millions Total (4,5,6) Within 1 Year 1-3 Years 3-5 Years More Than 5 Years Long-term debt (1) 2,075.8 596.9 1,478.9 Estimated interest payments on long-term debt (1) 992.3 83.0 166.0 166.0 577.3 Operating leases (2) 364.5 59.7 115.2 99.2 90.4 Purchase obligations (3) 333.8 134.4 99.5 49.0 50.9 Total 3,766.4 277.1 380.7 911.1 2,197.5 ____________ (1) Long-term debt includes $2,075.8 million of fixed rate debt. Fixed interest payments are reflected in the table above in the periods they are due, and include any issuance discounts. The table above includes the company's debt; debt of CIP is excluded from the table above, as the company is not obligated for these amounts. See Item 8, Financial Statements and Supplementary Data - Note 19 , Consolidated Investment Products," for additional information. (2) Operating leases reflect obligations for leased building space and other assets. See Item 8, Financial Statements and Supplementary Data - Note 13 , Operating Leases for sublease information. (3) In the ordinary course of business, Invesco enters into contracts or purchase obligations with third parties whereby the third parties provide services to or on behalf of Invesco. Purchase obligations included in the contractual obligations table above represent fixed-price contracts, which are either non-cancelable or cancelable with a penalty. At December 31, 2017 , the company's obligations primarily reflect standard service contracts for portfolio, market data, office-related services and third-party marketing and promotional services. In addition, the company is a party to certain variable-price contractual arrangements (e.g. contingent future payments based on AUM levels, number of accounts, transaction volume, etc.) for which the company is reimbursed by affiliated funds and as such are not included in the table above. Purchase obligations are recorded as liabilities in the company's Consolidated Financial Statements when services are provided. Purchase obligations also include contingent consideration liabilities. (4) The company has capital commitments into co-invested funds that are to be drawn down over the life of the partnership as investment opportunities are identified. At December 31, 2017 , the company's undrawn capital and purchase commitments were $292.8 million . These are not included in the above table. See Item 8, Financial Statements and Supplementary Data - Note 18 , Commitments and Contingencies for additional details. (5) Due to the uncertainty with respect to the timing of future cash flows associated with unrecognized tax benefits at December 31, 2017 , the company is unable to make reasonably reliable estimates of the period of cash settlement with the respective taxing authorities. Therefore, $19.6 million of gross unrecognized tax benefits have been excluded from the contractual obligations table above. See Item 8, Financial Statements and Supplementary Data, Note 15 - Taxation for a discussion regarding income taxes. (6) In addition to the contractual obligations in the table above, we periodically make contributions to defined benefit pension plans. For the years ended December 31, 2017 and 2016 we contributed $11.8 million and $14.2 million , respectively, to these plans. In 2018, we expect to contribute $24.5 million to our defined benefit pension plans. See Item 8, Financial Statements and Supplementary Data - Note 12 , Retirement Benefit Plans for detailed benefit pension plan information. The company has various other compensation and benefit obligations, including bonuses, commissions and incentive payments payable, defined contribution plan matching contribution obligations, and deferred compensation arrangements, that are excluded from the table above. 71 Table of Contents Critical Accounting Policies and Estimates Our significant accounting policies are disclosed in Item 8, Financial Statements and Supplementary Data - Note 1 , Accounting Policies." The accounting policies and estimates that we believe are the most critical to an understanding of our results of operations and financial condition are those that require complex management judgment regarding matters that are highly uncertain at the time policies were applied and estimates were made. These accounting policies and estimates are discussed below; however, the additional accounting policy detail in the footnote previously referenced is important to the discussion of each of the topics. Different estimates reasonably could have been used in the current period that would have had a material effect on these Consolidated Financial Statements, and changes in these estimates are likely to occur from period-to-period in the future. Taxation We operate in several countries and several states and other taxing jurisdictions through our various subsidiaries, and must allocate our income, expenses, and earnings under the various laws and regulations of each of these taxing jurisdictions. Accordingly, our provision for income taxes represents our total estimate of the liability that we have incurred for doing business each year in all of our locations. Annually we file tax returns that represent our filing positions within each jurisdiction and settle our return liabilities. Each jurisdiction has the right to audit those returns and may take different positions with respect to income and expense allocations and taxable earnings determinations. Because the determinations of our annual provisions are subject to judgments and estimates, it is possible that actual results will vary from those recognized in our Consolidated Financial Statements. As a result, it is likely that additions to, or reductions of, income tax expense will occur each year for prior reporting periods as actual tax returns and tax audits are settled. Deferred tax assets, net of any associated valuation allowance, have been recognized based on management's belief that taxable income of the appropriate character, more likely than not, will be sufficient to realize the benefits of these assets over time. In the event that actual results differ from our expectations, or if our historical trends of positive operating income changes, we may be required to record a valuation allowance on some or all of these deferred tax assets, which may have a significant effect on our financial condition and results of operations. In assessing whether a valuation allowance should be established against a deferred income tax asset, the company considers the nature, frequency and severity of recent losses, forecasts of future profitability, the duration of statutory carry back and carry forward periods, among other factors. The company utilizes a specific recognition threshold and measurement attribute for the Consolidated Financial Statement recognition and measurement of a tax position taken or expected to be taken in a tax return. The prescribed two-step process for evaluating a tax position involves first determining whether it is more likely than not that a tax position will be sustained upon examination by the appropriate taxing authorities. If it is, the second step then requires a company to measure this tax position benefit as the largest amount of benefit that is greater than 50 percent likely of being realized upon ultimate settlement. The company recognizes any interest and penalties related to unrecognized tax benefits on the Consolidated Statements of Income as components of income tax expense. The company recognized a provisional income tax benefit of $130.7 million which is included as a component of the provision for income taxes related to the 2017 Tax Act. See also Item 8, Financial Statements and Supplementary Data - in Note 15 , "Taxation," for further details and additional discussion on estimated amounts recorded as of December 31, 2017 for the 2017 Tax Act. Goodwill Our goodwill impairment testing conducted during 2017 and 2016 indicated that the fair value of the reporting unit exceeded its carrying value, indicating that step two of the goodwill impairment test was not necessary; however, the company cannot predict the occurrence of future events that might adversely affect the reported value of goodwill that totaled $6,590.7 million and $6,129.2 million at December 31, 2017 and December 31, 2016 , respectively. Such events include, but are not limited to, strategic decisions made in response to economic and competitive conditions, the impact of the economic environment on the company's AUM, or any other material negative change in AUM and related management fees. The October 1, 2017 annual goodwill impairment test was performed using a consistent methodology to that used for the 2016 annual impairment test. Fair value of the reporting unit is generally determined using an income approach where estimated future cash flows are discounted to arrive at a single present value amount. The income approach includes inputs that require significant management judgment, including AUM growth rates, product mix, effective fee rates, pre-tax profit margins, effective tax rates and discount rates. The 2017 annual goodwill impairment test includes assumptions updated for current market conditions, including the company's updated forecasts for changes in AUM due to market gains and long-term net flows and the corresponding changes in revenue and expenses. Market gains are based upon historical returns of the S&P 500 index, treasury bond returns and treasury bill returns, as applicable to the company's AUM mix on the testing date. The most sensitive of these assumptions are the estimated cash flows and the use of a weighted average cost of capital as the discount rate to determine present value. The most significant 72 Table of Contents change in assumptions from 2016 related to a change in cost of equity, which resulted in a discount rate of 11.68% for the October 1, 2017 analysis ( 2016 : 13.0%). The discount rates used are estimates of the weighted average cost of capital for the investment management sector reflecting the overall industry risks associated with future cash flows and have been calculated consistently from period to period. While the company believes all assumptions utilized in our assessment are reasonable and appropriate, changes in these estimates could produce different fair value amounts and therefore different goodwill impairment assessments. Intangible Assets Where evidence exists that the underlying arrangements have a high likelihood of continued renewal at little or no cost to the company, the intangible asset is assigned an indefinite life and reviewed for impairment on an annual basis. Definite-lived intangible assets are reviewed for impairment whenever events or changes in circumstances indicate that their carrying amount may not be recoverable (i.e. the carrying amount exceeds the fair value of the intangible asset). In addition, management's judgment is required to estimate the period over which definite-lived intangible assets will contribute to the company's cash flows and the pattern in which these assets will be consumed. A change in the remaining useful life of any of these assets, or the reclassification of an indefinite-lived intangible asset to a definite-lived intangible asset, could have a significant impact on the company's amortization expense, which was $17.4 million , $13.9 million and $10.6 million for the years ended December 31, 2017 , 2016 and 2015 , respectively. Intangible assets not subject to amortization are tested for impairment annually as of October 1 or more frequently if events or changes in circumstances indicate that the asset might be impaired. The impairment test consists of a comparison of the fair value of an intangible asset with its carrying amount. If the carrying amount of the intangible asset exceeds its fair value, an impairment loss is recognized in an amount equal to that excess. Fair value is generally determined using an income approach where estimated future cash flows are discounted to arrive at a single present value amount. The income approach includes inputs that require significant management judgment, including AUM growth rates, product mix, effective fee rates, pre-tax profit margins, effective tax rates and discount rates. The most relevant of these assumptions to the determination of the estimated fair value are the AUM growth rate and discount rate, which is a weighted average cost of capital including consideration of company size premiums. Changes in these estimates could produce different fair value amounts and therefore different impairment conclusions. In 2017 and 2016 , annual impairment reviews of indefinite-lived intangible assets determined that no impairment existed at the respective review dates, the classifications of indefinite-lived and definite-lived remain appropriate, and no changes to the expected lives of the definite-lived intangible assets were required. Investments A significant portion of our investments are carried at fair value on our balance sheet with the periodic mark-to-market recorded either in accumulated other comprehensive income in the case of available-for-sale investments, or directly to earnings, in the case of trading assets. Since assumptions are made in determining the fair values of investments for which active markets do not exist, the actual value that may be realized upon the sale or other disposition of these investments could differ from the current carrying values. Fair value calculations are also required in association with our quarterly impairment testing of investments. The accuracy of our other-than-temporary impairment assessments is dependent upon the extent to which we are able to accurately determine fair values. Seed money investments are held in Invesco managed funds with the purpose of providing capital to the funds during their development periods. These investments are recorded at fair value using quoted market prices in active markets; there is no modeling or additional information needed to arrive at the fair values of these investments. The value of investments may decline for various reasons. The market price may be affected by general market conditions which reflect prospects for the economy as a whole or by specific information pertaining to an industry or individual company. Such declines require further investigation by management, which considers all available evidence to evaluate the realizable value of the investment, including, but not limited to, the following factors: The probability that the company will be unable to collect all amounts due according to the contractual terms of a debt security not impaired at acquisition; The length of time and the extent to which the market value has been less than cost; The financial condition and near-term prospects of the issuer, including any specific events which may influence the operations of the issuer; The intent and ability of the company to retain its investment in the issuer for a period of time sufficient to allow for any anticipated recovery in market value; The decline in the security's value due to an increase in market interest rates or a change in foreign exchange rates since acquisition; Determination that the security is not realizable; or 73 Table of Contents An adverse change in estimated cash flows of a beneficial interest. Our other-than-temporary impairment analysis of available for sale seed money holdings includes a review of the market returns required for each fund portfolio to enable us to recover our original investment. As part of the review, we analyze the absolute amount of any loss to date, the trend of the losses, and percent declines in values of the seed money investments. Along with intent and ability to hold, all of these scenarios are considered as part of our other-than-temporary impairment analysis of seed money holdings. We also assess our equity method and other investments for impairment. If circumstances indicate that impairment may exist, a more detailed impairment analysis is performed which includes assessing many of the factors listed above. CIP Assessing if an entity is a variable interest entity (VIE) or voting interest entity (VOE) involves judgment and analysis on a structure-by-structure basis. Factors included in this assessment include the legal organization of the entity, the company's contractual involvement with the entity and any related party or de facto agent implications of the company's involvement with the entity. A VIE, in the context of the company and its managed funds, is a fund that does not have sufficient equity to finance its operations without additional subordinated financial support, or a fund for which the risks and rewards of ownership are not directly linked to voting interests. If the company is deemed to have the power to direct the activities of the fund that most significantly impact the fund's economic performance, and the obligation to absorb losses/right to receive benefits from the fund that could potentially be significant to the fund, then the company is deemed to be the fund's primary beneficiary and is required to consolidate the fund. Determining if the company is the primary beneficiary of a VIE also requires significant judgment judgment involved to assess if the company has the power to direct the activities that most significantly affect the fund's economic results and to assess if the company's interests could be deemed significant. If current financial statements are not available for consolidated VIEs or VOEs, estimation of investment valuation is required, which includes assessing available quantitative and qualitative data. Significant changes in these estimates could impact the reported value of the investments held by CIP and the related offsetting equity attributable to noncontrolling interests in consolidated entities on the Consolidated Balance Sheets and the other gains and losses of CIP, net, and related offsetting gains and losses attributable to noncontrolling interests in consolidated entities, net, amounts on the Consolidated Statements of Income. As of December 31, 2017 , the company consolidated VIEs that held investments of $5,658.0 million ( December 31, 2016 : $5,066.3 million ). As of December 31, 2016 the company consolidated VOEs that held fund investments of $49.8 million . As circumstances supporting estimates and factors change, the determination of VIE and primary beneficiary status may change, as could the determination of the necessity of consolidation of VOEs. Estimation is involved when determining investment and debt valuation for certain CIP; however, changes in the fair values of these amounts are largely offset by noncontrolling interests. Contingencies Contingencies arise when we have a present obligation as a result of a past event that is both probable and reasonably estimable. We must from time to time make material estimates with respect to legal and other contingencies. The nature of our business requires compliance with various laws and regulations, as well as various contractual obligations, and exposes us to a variety of legal proceedings and matters in the ordinary course of business. While the outcomes of matters such as these are inherently uncertain and difficult to predict, we maintain reserves reflected in accounts payable and accrued expenses, as appropriate, for identified losses that are, in our judgment, probable and reasonably estimable. We expense any related legal fees as they are incurred. Management's judgment is based on the advice of legal counsel, ruling on various motions by the applicable court, review of the outcome of similar matters, if applicable, and review of guidance from governmental and other regulatory authorities, if applicable. Contingent consideration payable in relation to a business acquisition is recorded as of the acquisition date as part of the fair value transferred in exchange for the acquired business.
