Item 7: Management Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations Overview General . Grainger is a broad-line distributor of maintenance, repair and operating supplies, and other related products and services used by businesses and institutions. Grainger operations are primarily in the United States and Canada, with an expanding presence in Europe, Asia and Latin America. Grainger uses a multichannel business model to provide customers with a range of options for finding and purchasing products utilizing sales representatives, catalogs and direct marketing materials and eCommerce. Grainger serves approximately 2.0 million customers worldwide through a network of highly integrated branches, distribution centers, multiple websites and export services. Grainger two reportable segments are the United States and Canada. The United States segment reflects the results of Grainger U.S. operating segment. The Canada segment reflects the results for Acklands Grainger Inc., Grainger Canadian operating segment. Other Businesses include the following significant operating segments which are not material individually and in the aggregate: Fabory Group, MonotaRO, Mexico, China and Colombia. Business Environment . Several economic factors and industry trends tend to shape Grainger business environment. The overall economy and leading economic indicators provide general insight into projecting Grainger growth. Historically, Grainger sales have tended to correlate with industrial production and non-farm payrolls. According to the Federal Reserve, overall industrial production increased 2.9% from December 2010 to December 2011. The United States GDP grew an estimated 1.7% in 2011 and Canada GDP grew an estimated 2.3% . The improvement in the economy has positively affected Grainger sales growth for 2011. In addition, changes in business inventory levels are a factor in Grainger's sales trends. The need for businesses to replenish inventories in 2010 and 2011 after the economic downturn contributed to Grainger's sales growth. According to the Bureau of Economic Analysis, inventory levels increased 3.5% and 2.1% in 2010 and 2011, respectively. In February 2012, Consensus Forecasts-USA projected 2012 Industrial Production growth of 3.4% , GDP growth of 2.2% and business inventory growth of 2.5% for the United States. In addition, Consensus Forecasts-USA projected GDP growth of 2.0% for Canada. The light and heavy manufacturing customer sectors, which comprised approximately 27% of Grainger total 2011 sales, have historically correlated with manufacturing employment levels and manufacturing production. Manufacturing employment levels in the United States increased approximately 2.0% from December 2010 to December 2011, while manufacturing output increased 1.3% . This increase in manufacturing employment and output contributed to a mid-teen percent increase in the heavy manufacturing customer sector and a high single-digit percent increase in the light manufacturing customer sector for Grainger in 2011. Outlook . Grainger plans to continue to make investments in growth drivers such as product line expansion, sales force expansion, eCommerce, inventory services, distribution centers and international expansion. These multi-year initiatives are expected to contribute to continued market share growth by helping businesses and institutions streamline their purchasing processes and reduce costs. As of January 25, 2012, Grainger forecasted 2012 sales growth to be in the range of 10 to 14%. Volume growth is expected to contribute 5 to 8% of the sales growth, price 2 to 3% and acquisitions an additional 3%. Earnings per share is forecasted to be in the range of $9.90 to $10.65 for the full year of 2012, reflecting higher sales growth and gross profit margin expansion, partially offset by growth investments. The guidance anticipated continued strong organic growth with increased investments. The forecasted gross profit margins, while expected to continue to expand, will also be tempered by faster growth from larger, contract customers with lower gross profit margins. Operating expenses as a percent of sales is expected to improve in 2012, although the cost leverage provided by faster growth and productivity improvements will be partially offset by the continued investments in the growth drivers. Matters Affecting Comparability . There were 255 sales days in 2011 , 254 in 2010 and 255 in 2009 . Grainger completed several acquisitions throughout 2011 and 2010 , all of which were immaterial individually and in the aggregate. Grainger operating results have included the results of each business acquired since the respective acquisition dates. 12 Results of Operations The following table is included as an aid to understanding changes in Grainger's Consolidated Statements of Earnings: For the Years Ended December 31, As a Percent of Net Sales Percent Increase/(Decrease) from Prior Year 2011 2010 2009 2011 2010 Net sales 100.0 % 100.0 % 100.0 % 12.5 % 15.4 % Cost of merchandise sold 56.5 58.2 58.2 9.4 15.3 Gross profit 43.5 41.8 41.8 16.8 15.7 Operating expenses 30.5 29.9 31.1 14.6 11.0 Operating earnings 13.0 11.9 10.7 22.3 29.4 Other income (expense) (0.1 ) 0.7 (86.5 ) (115.9 ) Income taxes 4.8 4.7 4.5 13.2 23.0 Noncontrolling interest 0.1 194.0 Net earnings attributable to W.W. Grainger, Inc. 8.1 % 7.1 % 6.9 % 28.9 % 18.7 % 2011 Compared to 2010 Grainger's net sales of $ 8,078.2 million for 2011 increased 12.5% when compared with net sales of $7,182.2 million for 2010 . There was one more selling day in 2011 versus 2010 . Daily sales were up 12.0% . For 2011 , approximately 8 percentage points of the sales growth came from an increase in volume. Approximately 2 percentage points came from business acquisitions, 2 percentage points from price and 1 percentage point due to foreign exchange, partially offset by a 1 percentage point decrease related to 2010 sales of products used to assist with the oil spill cleanup in the Gulf of Mexico. Sales to all customer end-markets except one increased for 2011 . The overall increase in net sales was led by a mid-teen percent increase to heavy manufacturing customers, followed by a high single-digit increase in light manufacturing. The agriculture and mining customer end-market declined due to the difficult comparison from the oil spill in 2010. Refer to the Segment Analysis below for further details. Gross profit of $ 3,510.8 million for 2011 increased 16.8% . The gross profit margin for 2011 was 43.5% , up 1.7 percentage points versus 2010 . The gross profit margin was favorably affected by price increases exceeding product costs increases, a decline in sales of low margin sourced products and lower excess and obsolete inventory requirements. Operating expenses of $ 2,458.4 million for 2011 increased 14.6% from $ 2,145.2 million for 2010 . Operating expenses increased primarily driven by volume-related costs, expenses from the Fabory Group acquisition and incremental spending on the Company's growth programs. The 2011 year also included approximately $18 million of costs related to the closure of branches in the United States. In addition, 2010 benefited by $33.1 million from a paid time off policy change, which reduced the related liability. Operating earnings of $ 1,052.4 million for 2011 increased 22.3% from $ 860.5 million for 2010 . The increase in operating earnings was due to higher sales and an improved gross profit margin, partially offset by operating expenses increasing at a faster rate than sales. Net earnings attributable to Grainger for 2011 increased by 28.9% to $ 658.4 million from $ 510.9 million in 2010 . The increase in net earnings for 2011 primarily resulted from an increase in operating earnings. Diluted earnings per share of $9.07 in 2011 were 30.9% higher than $6.93 for 2010 , due to increased net earnings and fewer shares outstanding. Earnings for 2011 included a $0.16 per share expense for branch closures, a $0.07 per share gain on the sale of a joint venture investment, and a $0.12 per share benefit from the settlement of tax reviews, which when combined, resulted in a net benefit of $0.03 per share. There were two non-cash items included in 2010 earnings, a $0.28 per share benefit from a change to a paid time off policy and a $0.15 per share tax expense related to the tax treatment of retiree healthcare benefits following the passage of the Patient Protection and Affordable Care Act, which when combined, resulted in a net benefit of $0.13 per share. Excluding these items from both years, net earnings increased 30.8% and earnings per share increased 32.9% in 2011 versus 2010 . 13 Segment Analysis The following comments at the reportable segment and other business unit level include external and intersegment net sales and operating earnings. See Note 17 to the Consolidated Financial Statements. United States Net sales were $ 6,501.3 million for 2011 , an increase of $ 481.2 million , or 8.0% , when compared with net sales of $ 6,020.1 million for 2010 . Daily sales in the United States were up 7.6% . Approximately 7 percentage points of the sales growth came from an increase in volume and approximately 3 percentage points was due to price, partially offset by a 2 percentage point decrease related to the 2010 sales of products used to assist with the oil spill cleanup in the Gulf of Mexico. Sales to all customer end-markets except one increased for 2011 . The overall increase in net sales was led by a mid-teen percent increase to heavy manufacturing customers and a high single-digit increase to light manufacturing customers. The agriculture and mining customer end-market declined due to the difficult comparisons from the oil spill in 2010. The segment gross profit margin increased 1.7 percentage points in 2011 over 2010 . The gross profit margin benefited from price increases exceeding product cost increases, a decline in sales of low margin sourced products and a lower excess and obsolete inventory requirement. Operating expenses were up 10.1% for 2011 versus 2010 . Operating expenses increased driven by volume and growth-related spending including new sales representatives, eCommerce, advertising and incremental expenses for the new distribution center in northern California. The 2011 year also included costs for the closure of 35 branches. Grainger continually reviews the effectiveness of the branch network. Currently, there are no plans for any significant branch openings or closures. In addition, 2010 included a $29.7 million benefit that resulted from a paid time off policy change, which reduced the related liability. Excluding the branch closure costs from 2011 and the 2010 benefit, operating expenses increased 7.1%. For the segment, operating earnings of $ 1,066.3 million for 2011 increased 15.9% over $ 920.2 million in 2010 . The improvement in operating earnings for 2011 was due to an increase in net sales and gross profit margin, partially offset by operating expenses increasing at a faster rate than sales. Canada Net sales were $ 992.8 million for 2011 , an increase of $ 171.9 million , or 20.9% , when compared with $ 820.9 million for 2010 . Daily sales were up 20.5% . In local currency, daily sales increased 15.7% for 2011 . Contributing to the sales growth was 3 percentage points from acquisitions. The increase in net sales was led by growth to heavy manufacturing, retail, oil and gas, and agriculture and mining customers. The gross profit margin increased 2.3 percentage points in 2011 over 2010 , primarily driven by lower product costs and stronger sales of private label products which carry higher margins. Operating expenses increased 9.7% in 2011 . In local currency, operating expenses increased 5.4% primarily due to increased payroll and benefits costs driven by higher bonus expense, headcount and incremental costs for acquisitions made over the last year. Non-payroll related expenses also increased driven by volume-related occupancy and warehouse costs. Operating earnings of $ 107.6 million for 2011 were up $ 60.8 million , or 129.7%, versus 2010 . In local currency, operating earnings increased 121.2% due to higher sales, an improved gross profit margin and operating expenses increasing at a slower rate than sales. Other Businesses Net sales for other businesses, which include the following significant operations: the Fabory Group, MonotaRO, Mexico, China and Colombia, were up 66.2% for 2011 . Daily sales increased 65.6% . The increase in net sales was due primarily to the Fabory Group acquired on August 31, 2011, along with strong growth from all the other international businesses. Operating earnings for other businesses were $ 31.0 million for 2011 compared to $ 11.7 million for 2010 . The increase was primarily driven by improved performance in Japan and Mexico. 14 Other Income and Expense Other income and expense was $0.9 million of expense in 2011 compared with $6.7 million in 2010. The following table summarizes the components of other income and expense (in thousands of dollars): For the Years Ended December 31, 2011 2010 Other income and (expense): Interest income (expense) - net $ (7,023 ) $ (6,972 ) Equity in net income (loss) of unconsolidated entity 314 (182 ) Gain on sale of investment in unconsolidated entity 7,639 Other non-operating income 709 1,608 Other non-operating expense (2,541 ) (1,151 ) $ (902 ) $ (6,697 ) The reduction in net expense was primarily attributable to a gain of $7.6 million in the fourth quarter of 2011 related to the divestiture of Grainger's 49% ownership in the MRO Korea Co., Ltd. joint venture. Income Taxes Income taxes of $ 385.1 million in 2011 increased 13.2% as compared with $ 340.2 million in 2010 . Grainger's effective tax rates were 36.6% and 39.8% in 2011 and 2010 , respectively. The Company settled various tax reviews providing a benefit to the 2011 effective tax rate. Tax law changes in Japan enacted in late November of 2011 also benefited the year. The 2010 effective tax rate included a tax expense related to the U.S. healthcare legislation enacted in the first quarter of 2010. Excluding these items in both years, the effective tax rate for 2011 was 38.1% compared to 39.1% in 2010, primarily the result of lower state tax expense and higher earnings in foreign jurisdictions with lower tax rates. For 2012 , Grainger is estimating its effective tax rate to be approximately 37.9%. 2010 Compared to 2009 Grainger's net sales of $7,182.2 million for 2010 increased 15.4% when compared with net sales of $6,222.0 million for 2009. There was one less selling day in 2010 versus 2009. Daily sales were up 15.9%. For 2010, approximately 10 percentage points of the sales growth came from an increase in volume, 4 percentage points came from business acquisitions, and 2 percentage points due to foreign exchange. Sales of products used to assist with the oil spill cleanup in the Gulf of Mexico and sales of seasonal products each contributed approximately 1 percentage point to the volume growth for 2010. Sales to all customer end-markets increased for 2010. The overall increase in net sales was led by a 30 percent increase to reseller customers, driven by sales of products used in the oil spill cleanup, a high-teen percent increase to heavy manufacturing customers, followed by a low double-digit increase in light manufacturing. Refer to the Segment Analysis below for further details. Gross profit of $3,005.7 million for 2010 increased 15.7%. The gross profit margin for 2010 was 41.8%, flat versus 2009. The gross profit margin was favorably affected by flat prices while product costs decreased, offset by faster sales growth from the lower margin international businesses and by an increase in sales to large customers, which are generally at lower margins. Operating expenses of $2,145.2 million for 2010 increased 11.0% from $1,933.3 million for 2009. Operating expenses increased primarily due to higher commissions, bonuses and profit sharing costs due to improved performance, partially offset by a $33.1 million benefit that resulted from a paid time off policy change, which reduced the related liability. Operating earnings of $860.5 million for 2010 increased 29.4% from $665.2 million for 2009. The increase in operating earnings was primarily due to the strong sales growth and operating expenses increasing at a slower rate than sales. 15 Net earnings attributable to Grainger for 2010 increased by 18.7% to $510.9 million from $430.5 million in 2009. The increase in net earnings for 2010 primarily resulted from an increase in operating earnings. Diluted earnings per share of $6.93 in 2010 were 23.3% higher than $5.62 for 2009, due to increased net earnings and fewer shares outstanding. There were two non-cash items included in 2010 earnings, a $0.28 per share benefit from a change to a paid time off policy and a $0.15 per share tax expense related to the tax treatment of retiree healthcare benefits following the passage of the Patient Protection and Affordable Care Act, which when combined, resulted in a net benefit of $0.13 per share. Results for 2009 included a $0.37 per share non-cash gain from the MonotaRO transaction in September 2009. Excluding these items from both years, net earnings increased 29.4% and earnings per share increased 29.5% in 2010 versus 2009. Segment Analysis The following comments at the reportable segment and other business unit level include external and intersegment net sales and operating earnings. See Note 17 to the Consolidated Financial Statements. United States Net sales were $6,020.1 million for 2010, an increase of $574.7 million, or 10.6%, when compared with net sales of $5,445.4 million for 2009. Daily sales in the United States were up 11.0%. Approximately 9 percentage points of the sales growth came from an increase in volume. In addition, acquisitions and price each added 1 percentage point. Sales to all customer end-markets except contractor customers increased for 2010. The overall increase in net sales was led by a mid-20 percent increase to reseller customers driven by the sales of products used to assist in the oil spill cleanup, a high-teen percent increase to heavy manufacturing customers and a low double-digit increase to light manufacturing customers. The segment gross profit margin increased 0.6 percentage point in 2010 over 2009. The gross profit margin benefited from price increases exceeding product cost increases, partially offset by an increase in sales to large customers, which are generally at lower margins. Operating expenses were up 6.0% for 2010 versus 2009. Operating expenses increased primarily due to higher commissions, bonus expense and profit sharing costs due to improved performance, partially offset by a $29.7 million benefit that resulted from a paid time off policy change, which reduced the related liability. For the segment, operating earnings of $920.2 million for 2010 increased 25.1% over $735.6 million in 2009. The improvement in operating earnings for 2010 was primarily due to an increase in net sales and gross profit margin, and operating expenses increasing at a slower rate than sales. Canada Net sales were $820.9 million for 2010, an increase of $169.7 million, or 26.1%, when compared with $651.2 million for 2009. Daily sales were up 26.6%. In local currency, daily sales increased 14.9% for 2010. Contributing to the sales growth was 3 percentage points for acquisitions. The increase in net sales was led by growth to oil and gas, construction, and agriculture and mining customers. The gross profit margin increased 0.4 percentage point in 2010 over 2009, primarily driven by lower product costs including the positive effect of foreign currency exchange on buying products in U.S. dollars. Operating expenses increased 32.0% in 2010. In local currency, operating expenses increased 19.7% primarily due to increased payroll and benefits costs including higher commissions and bonus expense, increased volume-related headcount and incremental costs for acquisitions made over the last year. Non-payroll related expenses also increased driven by higher travel, entertainment and advertising due to the sponsorship of the 2010 Winter Olympic Games, and increased occupancy and warehouse costs driven in part by the incremental costs for a distribution center opened in the 2010 second quarter. Operating earnings of $46.8 million for 2010 were up $3.1 million, or 7.1%, versus 2009 due to the foreign exchange rate impact. In local currency, operating earnings decreased 1% primarily due to increased operating expenses as discussed above. 16 Other Businesses Net sales for other businesses, which include the following significant operations: MonotaRO, Mexico, China and Colombia, were up 136.1% for 2010. Daily sales increased 137.0%. The increase in net sales was due primarily to the inclusion of a full year of results for Japan after obtaining controlling interest in September 2009 and Colombia, acquired in June 2010, along with strong growth from all the other international businesses. Operating earnings for other businesses were $11.7 million for 2010 compared to operating losses of $11.6 million for 2009. Other Income and Expense Other income and expense was $6.7 million of expense in 2010 compared with $42.1 million of income in 2009. The following table summarizes the components of other income and expense (in thousands of dollars): For the Years Ended December 31, 2010 2009 Other income and (expense): Interest income (expense) - net $ (6,972 ) $ (7,408 ) Equity in net (loss) income of unconsolidated entities (182 ) 1,497 Gain on previously held equity interest - net 47,343 Other non-operating income 1,608 964 Other non-operating expense (1,151 ) (283 ) $ (6,697 ) $ 42,113 The change from net income to net expense was primarily attributable to the non-cash gain of $47.4 million in 2009 from the step-up of the investment in MonotaRO after Grainger became a majority owner. Income Taxes Income taxes of $340.2 million in 2010 increased 23.0% as compared with $276.6 million in 2009. Grainger's effective tax rates were 39.8% and 39.1% in 2010 and 2009, respectively. The increase in the tax rate in 2010 was primarily driven by a one-time tax expense related to the U.S. healthcare legislation passed in the first quarter of 2010. Excluding this tax expense, the 2010 effective tax rate was 39.1%. 17 Financial Condition Grainger expects its strong working capital position, cash flows from operations and borrowing capacity to continue, allowing it to fund its operations, including growth initiatives, capital expenditures, acquisitions and repurchase of shares, as well as to pay cash dividends. Cash Flow Fiscal year 2011 compared with fiscal year 2010 Cash from operating activities continues to serve as Grainger's primary source of liquidity. Net cash flows from operations in 2011 were $746.1 million and increased $149.7 million from $596.4 million in 2010. The primary driver of the improvement was an increase in net earnings of $152.8 million. Higher accounts receivable and inventory balances, driven by growth in sales volumes and a new distribution center in northern California, partially offset by an increase in accounts payable, reduced the operating cash flow from net earnings. Net cash used in investing activities of $535.1 million in 2011 was driven by net cash expended for property, buildings, equipment and software of $189.7 million and net cash paid for business acquisitions of $359.3 million. Additional information regarding capital spending is detailed in the Capital Expenditures section below. Net cash used in investing activities was $365.9 million more than in 2010 due primarily to an increase in net cash paid for business acquisitions of $297.2 million versus 2010. Net cash used in financing activities of $177.4 million in 2011 decreased $401.2 million from $578.6 million in 2010. The decrease was primarily due to lower treasury shares repurchases in 2011 versus 2010. Cash paid for treasury share purchases was $151.1 million in 2011 versus $504.8 million in 2010, a reduction of $353.7 million. Fiscal year 2010 compared with fiscal year 2009 Net cash flows from operations of $596.4 million in 2010 decreased $136.0 million from $732.4 million in 2009. Excluding business acquisitions, the decrease was primarily due to increases in accounts receivable of $127.8 million and inventories of $80.5 million, driven by the higher sales volumes. The decrease was partially offset by an increase in net earnings. Net cash used in investing activities of $169.2 million in 2010 decreased $93.4 million versus $262.6 million in 2009. Net cash expended for property, buildings, equipment and software of $120.6 million decreased $20.1 million from $140.7 million in 2009. Additional information regarding capital spending is detailed in the Capital Expenditures section below. In addition, net cash paid for business acquisitions decreased $61.0 million versus 2009. Net cash used in financing activities of $578.6 million in 2010 increased $165.1 million from $413.5 million in 2009. Grainger repaid $239.1 million of long-term debt in 2010 and issued $200.0 million of commercial paper, resulting in a net use of cash. Cash paid for treasury share purchases of $504.8 million was $132.1 million higher than $372.7 million in 2009. Grainger repurchased 4.6 million shares in 2010 compared to 4.5 million shares in 2009. Working Capital Internally generated funds are the primary source of working capital and funds used in business expansion, supplemented by debt. In addition, funds are expended on facilities to support growth initiatives, as well as for business and systems development and other infrastructure improvements. Working capital, defined as current assets less current liabilities, was $ 1,307.0 million at December 31, 2011, compared with $ 1,368.8 million at December 31, 2010. At these dates, the ratio of current assets to current liabilities was 1.9 and 2.6 . The $61.8 million decrease in working capital and lower current ratio was primarily due to an increase in current maturities of long-term debt and accounts payable, partially offset by an increase in accounts receivable and inventory. The changes were primarily driven by higher sales volumes, the acquisition of the Fabory Group and a new distribution center in northern California. 18 Capital Expenditures In each of the past three years, a portion of operating cash flow has been used for additions to property, buildings, equipment and capitalized software as summarized in the following table (in thousands of dollars): For the Years Ended December 31, 2011 2010 2009 Land, buildings, structures and improvements $ 51,249 $ 61,001 $ 68,745 Furniture, fixtures, machinery and equipment 118,228 50,152 64,766 Subtotal 169,477 111,153 133,511 Capitalized software 27,465 15,971 8,903 Total $ 196,942 $ 127,124 $ 142,414 In 2011, significant expenditures were made to build new distribution centers in the United States and for distribution center expansion in Canada. Also, a large investment was made to update and improve the eCommerce platform in the United States business. Finally, the Company continued to invest in new and existing international businesses, as well as for normal recurring replacement of equipment. In 2010 and 2009, significant capital expenditures included investments in the distribution center network in the U.S. and Canada. Additional expenditures were for normal recurring replacement of equipment. Capital expenditures are expected to range from $200 million to $225 million in 2012. Projected spending includes continued investments in the supply chain (primarily the new Chicago distribution center and distribution centers in Canada), technology infrastructure, and continued investments in eCommerce. Grainger expects to fund 2012 capital investments from operating cash flows. Debt Grainger maintains a debt ratio and liquidity position that provides flexibility in funding working capital needs and long-term cash requirements. In addition to internally generated funds, Grainger has various sources of financing available, including bank borrowings under lines of credit. Refer to Notes 7 and 8 of the Consolidated Financial Statements included in Item 8. Total debt as a percent of total capitalization was 15.9% and 17.8% as of December 31, 2011 and 2010, respectively. The reduction in total debt as a percent of total capitalization was primarily due to increased retained earnings associated with strong earnings in 2011. Grainger believes any circumstances that would trigger early payment or acceleration with respect to any outstanding debt obligations would not have a material impact on its results of operations or financial position. 19 Commitments and Other Contractual Obligations At December 31, 2011, Grainger's contractual obligations, including estimated payments due by period, are as follows (in thousands of dollars): Payments Due by Period Total Amounts Committed Less than 1 Year 1 - 3 Years 4 - 5 Years More than 5 Years Long-term debt obligations $ 396,594 $ 221,539 $ 19,096 $ 148,096 $ 7,863 Interest on long-term debt 19,523 4,709 7,607 6,039 1,168 Operating lease obligations 222,853 55,601 84,977 51,506 30,769 Purchase obligations: Uncompleted additions to property, buildings and equipment 45,558 45,558 Commitments to purchase inventory 343,185 343,185 Other purchase obligations 166,017 93,734 63,055 9,228 Other liabilities 433,597 170,417 20,494 22,639 220,047 Total $ 1,627,327 $ 934,743 $ 195,229 $ 237,508 $ 259,847 Purchase obligations for inventory are made in the normal course of business to meet operating needs. While purchase orders for both inventory purchases and non-inventory purchases are generally cancelable without penalty, certain vendor agreements provide for cancellation fees or penalties depending on the terms of the contract. Other liabilities represent future benefit payments for postretirement benefit plans and postemployment disability medical benefits as determined by actuarial projections, and other employee benefit plans. Other employment-related benefits costs of $60.3 million have not been included in this table as the timing of benefit payments is not statistically predictable. See Note 10 to the Consolidated Financial Statements. See also Notes 8 and 11 to the Consolidated Financial Statements for further detail related to the interest on long-term debt and operating lease obligations, respectively. Grainger has recorded a noncurrent liability of $23.9 million for tax uncertainties and interest at December 31, 2011. This amount is excluded from the table above, as Grainger cannot make reliable estimates of these cash flows by period. See Note 15 to the Consolidated Financial Statements. Off-Balance Sheet Arrangements Grainger does not have any material exposures to off-balance sheet arrangements. Grainger does not have any variable interest entities or activities that include non-exchange-traded contracts accounted for at fair value. 20 Critical Accounting Estimates The preparation of financial statements, in conformity with accounting principles generally accepted in the United States of America, requires management to make judgments, estimates and assumptions that affect the reported amounts of assets, liabilities, revenues and expenses in the financial statements. Management bases its estimates on historical experience and other assumptions, which it believes are reasonable. If actual amounts are ultimately different from these estimates, the revisions are included in Grainger's results of operations for the period in which the actual amounts become known. Accounting policies are considered critical when they require management to make assumptions about matters that are highly uncertain at the time the estimates are made and when there are different estimates that management reasonably could have made, which would have a material impact on the presentation of Grainger's financial condition, changes in financial condition or results of operations. Note 1 to the Consolidated Financial Statements describes the significant accounting policies used in the preparation of the Consolidated Financial Statements. The most significant areas involving management judgments and estimates follow. Actual results in these areas could differ materially from management's estimates under different assumptions or conditions. Allowance for Doubtful Accounts . Grainger considers several factors to estimate the allowance for uncollectible accounts receivable including the age of the receivables, the percent past due and the historical ratio of actual write-offs to the age of the receivables. The analyses performed also take into consideration economic conditions that may have an impact on a specific industry, group of customers or a specific customer. Based on analysis of actual historical write-offs of uncollectible accounts receivable, Grainger's estimates and assumptions have been materially accurate in regards to the valuation of its allowance for doubtful accounts. However, write-offs could be materially different than the reserves established if business or economic conditions change or actual results deviate from historical trends, and Grainger's estimates and assumptions may be revised as appropriate to reflect these changes. For years 2011, 2010 and 2009, actual results did not vary materially from estimated amounts. Inventory Reserves . Grainger establishes inventory reserves for shrinkage and excess and obsolete inventory. Provisions for inventory shrinkage are based on historical experience to account for unmeasured usage or loss. For fiscal years 2011, 2010 and 2009, actual results did not vary materially from estimated amounts. Grainger regularly reviews inventory to evaluate continued demand and identify any obsolete or excess quantities. Grainger records provisions for the difference between excess and obsolete inventory and its estimated realizable value. Estimated realizable value is based on anticipated future product demand, market conditions and liquidation values. As Grainger's inventory consists of approximately 900,000 stocked products, it is not practical to quantify the actual disposition of excess and obsolete inventory against estimated amounts at a SKU level and no individual SKU is material. There were no material differences noted between reserve levels compared to the level of write-offs historically. Grainger's methodology for estimating reserves is continually evaluated based on current experience and the methodology provides for a materially accurate level of reserves at any reporting date. Actual results could differ materially from projections and require changes to reserves which could have a material effect on Grainger's results of operations based on significant changes in product demand, market conditions or liquidation value. If business or economic conditions change, Grainger's estimates and assumptions may be revised as appropriate. For fiscal years 2011, 2010 and 2009, actual results did not vary materially from estimated amounts. Goodwill and Indefinite Lived Intangible Assets . Grainger's business acquisitions result in the recording of goodwill and identified intangible assets which affect the amount of amortization expense and possibly impairment write-downs that may occur in future periods. Grainger annually reviews goodwill and intangible assets that have indefinite lives for impairment in the fourth quarter and when events or changes in circumstances indicate the carrying value of these assets might exceed their current fair values. Grainger tests for goodwill impairment at the reporting unit level. 21 During the fourth quarter of 2011, Grainger early adopted the Financial Accounting Standard Board's new accounting guidance, which allows companies to assess qualitative factors such as a reporting unit's current performance and overall economic factors to determine if it is more-likely-than-not that the goodwill might be impaired and whether it is necessary to perform the two-step quantitative goodwill impairment test. Grainger completed the annual impairment testing using the qualitative approach for all of its reporting units and the two-step quantitative test for one of its reporting units with the carrying value of goodwill of $17 million. The estimated fair value of the reporting unit exceeded its carrying value and no indication of impairment existed as of the test date. Grainger uses the discounted cash flow method to derive the fair value of a reporting unit. The discounted cash flow method requires considerable management judgment, assumptions and estimates regarding future profitability and cash flows of its reporting units and general market conditions, including terminal growth rate and discount rate assumptions. Due to the inherent uncertainties associated with these unobservable Level 3 inputs, the results of these tests may differ and impairment charges could occur in future periods. While Grainger will continue to consider the economic environment and other pertinent factors that may have an adverse effect on its reporting units, there can be no assurance that Grainger's estimates and assumptions regarding forecasted cash flows or other inputs used in forecasting the fair value of future cash flows will prove to be accurate projections. Stock Incentive Plans . Grainger maintains stock incentive plans under which a variety of incentive grants may be awarded to employees and directors. Grainger uses a binomial lattice option pricing model to estimate the value of stock option grants. The model requires projections of the risk-free interest rate, expected life, volatility, expected dividend yield and forfeiture rate of the stock option grants. The fair value of options granted in 2011, 2010 and 2009 used the following assumptions: For the Years Ended December, 2011 2010 2009 Risk-free interest rate 2.6% 2.9% 2.4% Expected life 6 years 6 years 6 years Expected volatility 24.6% 24.7% 28.8% Expected dividend yield 1.8% 2.0% 2.3% The risk-free interest rate is selected based on yields from U.S. Treasury zero-coupon issues with a remaining term approximately equal to the expected term of the options being valued. The expected life selected for options granted during each year presented represents the period of time that the options are expected to be outstanding based on historical data of option holders' exercise and termination behavior. Expected volatility is based upon implied and historical volatility of the closing price of Grainger's stock over a period equal to the expected life of each option grant. Historical information is also the primary basis for selection of the expected dividend yield assumptions. Because stock option compensation expense is based on awards ultimately expected to vest, it has been reduced for estimated forfeitures, using historical forfeiture experience. The amount of stock option compensation expense is significantly affected by the valuation model and these assumptions. If a different valuation model or different assumptions were used, the stock option compensation expense could be significantly different from what is recorded in the current period. Compensation expense for other stock-based awards is based upon the closing market price on the last trading date preceding the date of the grant. For additional information concerning stock incentive plans, see Note 12 to the Consolidated Financial Statements. Postretirement Healthcare Benefits . Postretirement healthcare obligations and net periodic costs are dependent on assumptions and estimates used in calculating such amounts. The assumptions used include, among others, discount rates, assumed rates of return on plan assets and healthcare cost trend rates, and certain employee-related factors, such as turnover, retirement age and mortality rates. Changes in these and other assumptions (caused by conditions in equity markets or plan experience, for example) could have a material effect on Grainger's postretirement benefit obligations and expense, and could affect its results of operations and financial condition. These changes in assumptions may also affect voluntary decisions to make additional contributions to the trust established for funding the postretirement benefit obligation. 22 The discount rate assumptions used by management reflect the rates available on high-quality fixed income debt instruments as of December 31, the measurement date, of each year. A lower discount rate increases the present value of benefit obligations and net periodic benefit costs. As of December 31, 2011, Grainger decreased the discount rate used in the calculation of the postretirement plan obligation from 5.6% to 4.5% to reflect the decrease in market interest rates. Grainger estimates that this decrease could reduce 2012 pretax earnings by approximately $9.1 million. However, other changes in assumptions may increase, decrease or eliminate this effect. Grainger considers the long-term historical actual return on plan assets and the historical performance of the Standard & Poor's 500 Index and the Total International Composite Index in developing its expected long-term return on plan assets. In 2011, Grainger maintained the expected long-term rate of return on plan assets of 6.0% (net of tax at 40%) based on the historical average of long-term rates of return. A 1 percentage point change in assumed healthcare cost trend rates would have had the following effects on December 31, 2011 results (in thousands of dollars): 1 Percentage Point Increase (Decrease) Effect on total of service and interest cost $ 7,330 $ (5,567 ) Effect on accumulated postretirement benefit obligation 77,550 (59,424 ) Grainger may terminate or modify the postretirement plan at any time, subject to the provisions of the Employee Retirement Income Security Act of 1974 (ERISA) and the Internal Revenue Code, as amended. In the event the postretirement plan is terminated, all assets of the Group Benefit Trust inure to the benefit of the participants. The foregoing assumptions are based on the presumption that the postretirement plan will continue. Were the postretirement plan to terminate, different actuarial assumptions and other factors might be applicable. Grainger has used its best judgment in making assumptions and estimates and believes such assumptions and estimates used are appropriate. Changes to the assumptions may be required in future years as a result of actual experience or new trends and, therefore, may affect Grainger's retirement plan obligations and future expense. For additional information concerning postretirement healthcare benefits, see Note 10 to the Consolidated Financial Statements. Insurance Reserves . Grainger retains a significant portion of the risk of certain losses related to workers' compensation, general liability and property losses through the utilization of high deductibles and self-insured retentions. There are also certain other risk areas for which Grainger does not maintain insurance. Grainger is responsible for establishing accounting policies on insurance reserves. Although it relies on outside parties to project future claims costs, it retains control over actuarial assumptions, including loss development factors and claim payment patterns. Grainger performs ongoing reviews of its insured and uninsured risks, which it uses to establish the appropriate reserve levels. In calculating the liability, historical trends, claims experience and loss development patterns are analyzed and appropriate loss development factors are applied to the incurred costs associated with the claims made. The use of assumptions in the analysis leads to fluctuations in required reserves over time. Any change in the required reserve balance is reflected in the current period's results of operations. Grainger believes its estimates are reasonable based on the information currently available and the methodology used to estimate these reserves has been consistently applied. There were no material adjustments based on Grainger's historical experience in 2011, 2010 and 2009. If actual trends, including the nature, severity or frequency of claims differ from our estimates, or if business or economic conditions change, Grainger's estimates and assumptions may be revised as appropriate and the results of operations could be materially impacted. Income Taxes . Grainger recognizes deferred tax assets and liabilities for the expected future tax consequences of events that have been included in the financial statements or tax returns. Under this method, deferred tax assets and liabilities are determined based on the differences between the financial reporting and tax bases of assets and liabilities, using enacted tax rates in effect for the year in which the differences are expected to reverse. The tax balances and income tax expense recognized by Grainger are based on management's interpretations of the tax laws of multiple jurisdictions. Income tax expense reflects Grainger's best estimates and assumptions regarding, among other items, the level of future taxable income, interpretation of tax laws and tax planning opportunities and uncertain tax positions. 23 Future rulings by tax authorities and future changes in tax laws and their interpretation, changes in projected levels of taxable income and future tax planning strategies could impact the actual effective tax rate and tax balances recorded by Grainger. Other . Other significant accounting policies, not involving the same level of measurement uncertainties as those discussed above, are nevertheless important to an understanding of the financial statements. Policies such as revenue recognition, depreciation, intangibles, long-lived assets, fair value measurements and valuations, and warranties require judgments on complex matters that are often subject to multiple external sources of authoritative guidance such as the Financial Accounting Standards Board (FASB) and the Securities and Exchange Commission. Possible changes in estimates or assumptions associated with these policies are not expected to have a material effect on the financial condition or results of operations of Grainger. More information on these additional accounting policies can be found in Note 1 to the Consolidated Financial Statements. Inflation Inflation during the last three years has not had a significant effect on operations. The predominant use of the last-in, first-out (LIFO) method of accounting for inventories and accelerated depreciation methods for financial reporting and income tax purposes result in a substantial recognition of the effects of inflation in the financial statements. Some of Grainger's products contain significant amounts of commodity-priced materials, such as steel, copper, petroleum derivatives or rare earth minerals, and are subject to price changes based upon fluctuations in the commodities market. Grainger has been able to successfully pass on cost increases to its customers minimizing the effect of inflation on results of operations. Grainger believes the most positive means to combat inflation and advance the interests of investors lie in the continued application of basic business principles, which include improving productivity, maintaining working capital turnover and offering products and services that can command appropriate prices in the marketplace. Forward-Looking Statements This Form 10-K contains statements that are not historical in nature but concern future results and business plans, strategies and objectives and other matters that may be deemed to be forward-looking statements under the federal securities laws. Grainger has generally identified such forward-looking statements by using words such as anticipate, anticipated, assumed, assumes, assumption, assumptions, believe, believes, can, continue, continued, continues, continues to believe it has complied, continuing, could, estimate, estimated, estimates, expect, expectation, expected, expects, forecast, forecasts, if, intend, intended, intends, may, might, plans, predict, predictable, presumption, project, projected, projecting, projection, projections, potential, potentially, reasonably likely, scheduled, should, strategy, tended, timing and outcome are uncertain, unanticipated, will, will be realized, and would or similar expressions. Grainger cannot guarantee that any forward-looking statement will be realized, although Grainger does believe that its assumptions underlying its forward-looking statements are reasonable. Achievement of future results is subject to risks and uncertainties that could cause Grainger's results to differ materially from those which are presented. Factors that could cause actual results to differ materially from those presented or implied in a forward-looking statement include, without limitation: higher product costs or other expenses; a major loss of customers; loss or disruption of source of supply; increased competitive pricing pressures; failure to develop or implement new technologies or business strategies; the outcome of pending and future litigation or governmental or regulatory proceedings; investigations, inquiries, audits and changes in laws and regulations; disruption of information technology or data security systems; general industry or market conditions; general global economic conditions; currency exchange rate fluctuations; market volatility; commodity price volatility; labor shortages; litigation involving appropriate payment for wages; facilities disruptions or shutdowns; higher fuel costs or disruptions in transportation services; natural and other catastrophes; unanticipated weather conditions; and the factors identified in Item 1A, Risk Factors. Caution should be taken not to place undue reliance on Grainger's forward-looking statements and Grainger undertakes no obligation to publicly update the forward-looking statements, whether as a result of new information, future events or otherwise. 24
