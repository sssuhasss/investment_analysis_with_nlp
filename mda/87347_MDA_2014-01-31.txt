Item 7. Management Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations. The following discussion and analysis contains forward-looking statements, including, without limitation, statements relating to our plans, strategies, objectives, expectations, intentions and resources. Such forward-looking statements should be read in conjunction with our disclosures under Item 1A. Risk Factors of this Form 10-K. Executive Overview Schlumberger revenue in 2013 reached a new high of $45.3 billion an increase of 8% over 2012. International revenue grew by $3.2 billion, or 11%, on higher exploration and development activity both offshore and in key land markets. In North America, we demonstrated continued resilience to the challenging land market by growing the business by close to $400 million, or 3%, aided by our strong position in the offshore market particularly in the US Gulf of Mexico. Yearly growth in global oil demand has been stabilizing at close to 1 million barrels per day for the past three years. This has been driven by the emerging economies, notably in Asia and in the Middle East, while consumption in the OECD countries has levelled after declining for three consecutive years as a result of energy efficiency gains. In terms of supply, markets are well balanced, with North America benefiting from the activity-intensive development of tight oil resources that almost single-handedly drove the increase in global crude oil production in 2013. Output from other areas, both OPEC and non-OPEC, remained stable. In terms of price, geopolitical and security tensions in the Middle East, and major outages in Libya supported oil prices, with spot Brent prices averaging $109- per barrel in 2013, only slightly below the $112 per barrel of 2012. International gas markets remained tight during the year, driven by strong demand in Japan and in the emerging economies in Asia. Relatively limited additional liquefied natural gas and interregional pipeline capacity contributed to support prices at oil-parity in the Asian spot markets. In North America, after having reached a 10-year low in 2012, natural gas spot prices rallied by 35% in 2013 from progressive rebalancing of supply and demand as well as from relatively cold temperatures in the final months of the year. Steady production levels particularly from the continuing development of the Marcellus shale gas play together with strong competition with coal in the power sector prevented prices from rising further. Against this background, Schlumberger international performance during the year was led by the Middle East & Asia Area, which grew by 23% from an expanding portfolio of projects and activities in key land markets in the Middle East, increased exploration and development work across Asia, and sustained activity in Australasia and China. Within the Europe/CIS/Africa Area, year-on-year revenue grew by 8%, led by the Russia and Central Asia region on strong land activity in West Siberia, and robust offshore projects in Sakhalin. The Latin America Area grew by 3% over the year, mainly due to good progress on the Shushufindi production management project in Ecuador, and strong integrated project management activity in Argentina. In North America, revenue strengthened by 3% driven by higher offshore drilling and exploration activity. All three Product Groups benefited from the growth in activity. Reservoir Characterization revenue grew by 10% over the year from market share gains and higher exploration activity in offshore and key international land markets. Drilling Group revenue, up 9%, increased on robust demand for services as offshore drilling activity strengthened in the US Gulf of Mexico, Sub-Saharan Africa, Russia and in the Middle East & Asia Area. Drilling Group revenue also increased in key international land markets in Saudi Arabia, China and Australia on higher rig count. Production Group revenue grew by 8%, mostly from activity in the international GeoMarkets. During the first half of the year, the OneSubsea joint venture with Cameron was finalized, combining Schlumberger deep understanding of the reservoir and our industry-leading well completions, subsea processing and integration capabilities with the design capability, manufacturing excellence, and installation record of Cameron. OneSubsea was formed to offer best-in-class subsea solutions by optimizing complete subsea production systems that help customers improve subsea development production and recovery. Looking ahead to 2014, economic fundamentals are expected to further improve in the US while Europe seems set for stronger growth. These positive effects should overcome lower growth in some developing economies and support a continuing rebound in the world economy. Within this scenario, oil demand forecasts in 2014 have now been revised upwards to the highest growth rate in several years. Oil supply is expected to keep pace with demand with the market therefore remaining well balanced. Natural gas prices internationally should be supported by demand in Asia and Europe, while in the US no change in fundamentals is expected, with any meaningful recovery in dry gas drilling activity still some way out in the future. With exploration and production spending expected to grow further in 2014, led by international activity and continuing strength in deepwater US Gulf of Mexico, Schlumberger remains positive and optimistic about the year ahead on the back of a well-balanced business portfolio, wide geographical footprint, and strengthening operational, organizational, and executional capability. 14 The following discussion and analysis of results of operations should be read in conjunction with the Consolidated Financial Statements .

(4) Charges and credits are described in detail in Note 3 to the Consolidated Financial Statements . Oilfield Services Fourth-quarter revenue of $11.91 billion increased $298 million or 3% sequentially. Approximately 75% of the sequential revenue increase came from the year-end surge in product and software sales, and 25% came from higher multiclient seismic sales. 15 International revenue of $8.15 billion grew $235 million or 3% sequentially, while North America Area revenue of $3.65 billion increased $47 million or 1% sequentially. Sequentially, Reservoir Characterization Group revenue grew 1% to $3.25 billion, while Drilling Group revenue of $4.50 billion was 2% higher. Production Group revenue increased 5% sequentially to $4.22 billion. The increase in Reservoir Characterization Group revenue resulted mainly from robust international end-of-year SIS software sales and an increase in WesternGeco multiclient sales. This increase, however, was largely offset by a sharp seasonal decline in WesternGeco Marine revenue on lower vessel utilization following completion of surveys in Norway and Canada. Wireline also declined sequentially on the conclusion of exploration projects in Eastern Canada and East Africa together with the seasonal slowdown in Russia. Drilling Group revenue increased on international demand for Drilling & Measurements and M-I SWACO technologies in Mexico and Russia & Central Asia as well as in the Middle East & Asia Area. Stronger IPM project activity in Mexico, Saudi Arabia and Iraq also contributed to the increase. The increase in Production Group revenue resulted primarily from stronger Completions and Artificial Lift product year-end sales. Well Intervention Services declined mainly in North America land, while Well Services revenue grew primarily from higher activity in international markets. Well Services stage count in North America land also increased, but revenue declined from persistent pricing weakness as a result of the continuing hydraulic horsepower oversupply. Sequentially by Area, Middle East & Asia led the increase with revenue of $2.94 billion growing 5%, mainly from the continued increase in drilling activity and the start of new IPM projects in Saudi Arabia; strong product sales and increased seismic activity in the United Arab Emirates; strong product and year-end software sales in Kuwait; strong land and offshore exploration activity in the Australasia and Thailand & Myanmar GeoMarkets; and increased WesternGeco marine vessel activity in the Brunei, Malaysia & Philippines GeoMarket. The increase, however, was partially reduced by a decline in revenue in Iraq from the temporary shut-down in operations linked to a security incident. In Latin America, revenue of $2.00 billion increased 3%, led by Mexico and Central America on robust deepwater exploration in addition to stronger land-based project activities. Strong IPM fracturing and drilling activity in Argentina and solid progress on SPM projects in Ecuador also contributed to the increase. Europe/CIS/Africa revenue of $3.21 billion increased 1% mainly due to robust product and software sales across the Area particularly in Continental Europe; significant testing and seismic activities in Angola; and increased offshore seismic and drilling in Azerbaijan and Turkmenistan. The increase, however, was partially reduced by seasonally lower activity in Russia and decreased WesternGeco vessel utilization following the seasonal transit of vessels out of the North Sea. North America revenue of $3.65 billion increased 1% sequentially. Land continued to experience pricing weakness in drilling, stimulation and wireline services, although the effect of this was offset by increased service intensity, improved efficiency, market share gains, new technology uptake and business expansion. Offshore revenue declined following seasonal completion of seismic and exploration campaigns in Eastern Canada while revenue in the US Gulf of Mexico grew on higher drilling and testing activities. Fourth-quarter pretax operating income of $2.60 billion was up 4% sequentially. International pretax operating income of $1.92 billion increased 4% sequentially, while North America pretax operating income of $716 million declined 2% sequentially. Sequentially, pretax operating margin of 21.9% increased 37 basis points (bps), as International pretax operating margin expanded 23 bps to 23.5%. Middle East & Asia and Europe/CIS/Africa margins were steady at 26.1% and 22.6%, respectively, while Latin America expanded 59 bps to reach 21.2% on higher-margin exploration drilling and project activity. North America pretax operating margin declined 67 bps to 19.6% due to a seasonal holiday slowdown in activity and continued pricing weakness on land. Sequentially by segment, Reservoir Characterization Group pretax operating margin expanded 132 bps to 31.7% due to strong end-of-year sales of SIS software and WesternGeco multiclient licenses, while the pretax operating margins of the Drilling and Production Groups were 19.6% and 17.3%, respectively. Reservoir Characterization Group Fourth-quarter revenue of $3.25 billion increased 1% sequentially. Pretax operating income of $1.03 billion was 5% higher sequentially. Sequentially, the increase in revenue was mainly driven by robust international end-of-year SIS software sales and an increase in WesternGeco multiclient sales. These increases, however, were largely offset by the sharp seasonal decline in WesternGeco Marine revenue on lower vessel utilization following completion of surveys in Norway and Canada. Wireline also declined sequentially on the completion of exploration projects in Eastern Canada and East Africa, and the seasonal slowdown of activity in Russia. Pretax operating margin of 31.7% increased 132 bps sequentially. The sequential increase from strong end-of-year sales of SIS software and WesternGeco multiclient licenses was partially offset by lower WesternGeco Marine vessel utilization and decreased Wireline high-technology activity following completion of exploration projects. Drilling Group Fourth-quarter revenue of $4.50 billion was up 2% sequentially. Pretax operating income of $880 million was 2% lower sequentially. 16 Sequentially, revenue increased on international demand for Drilling & Measurements and M-I SWACO technologies in Mexico and Russia & Central Asia as well as in the Middle East & Asia Area. Stronger IPM project activity in Mexico, Saudi Arabia and Iraq also contributed to the increase. Sequentially, pretax operating margin declined 69 bps to 19.6%. The sequential decline was due to operational start-up delays and the geographical mix of activity. Production Group Fourth-quarter revenue of $4.22 billion increased 5% sequentially. Pretax operating income of $730 million was 3% higher sequentially. The increase in revenue resulted primarily from stronger Completions and Artificial Lift product year-end sales coupled with new technology uptake and business expansion. Well Intervention Services declined mainly in North America land, while Well Services revenue grew primarily from higher activity in international markets. Well Services stage count in North America land also increased, but revenue declined from the persistent pricing weakness resulting from the continued hydraulic horsepower oversupply. Sequentially, pretax operating margin of 17.3% was essentially flat. The sequential result was attributable to the favorable impact of year-end Completions and Artificial Lift product sales and improved SPM profitability being fully offset by continued Well Services pricing weakness and decline in Well Intervention Services activity.

(4) Charges and credits are described in detail in Note 3 to the Consolidated Financial Statements . Oilfield Services Full-year 2013 revenue of $45.27 billion increased 8% versus the same period last year with international revenue 11% higher and North America Area revenue increasing 3%. Internationally, higher exploration and development activities in a number of GeoMarkets, both offshore and in key land markets, contributed to the increase. The increase was led by the Middle East & Asia which increased 23%, mainly from robust results across a diversified portfolio of projects and activities in Saudi Arabia, Iraq, and United Arab Emirates; increased seismic surveys across Asia; and sustained land and offshore drilling activity in the Australasia and China GeoMarkets. Europe/CIS/Africa increased 8%, led by the Russia and Central Asia region on strong land activity in West Siberia and robust offshore projects in Sakhalin. The Sub-Saharan Africa region increased on strong development, exploration and seismic activities as well. Latin America was 3% higher, mainly due to solid progress on an SPM project in Ecuador and strong IPM results in Argentina. North America growth was driven by increased offshore revenue as a result of higher drilling and exploration activities. This increase was largely offset by a decline in land as a result of a reduction in rig count and pricing weakness in the areas of drilling, stimulation and wireline, although the downward pricing trend slowed during the second and third quarters. Full-year 2013 pretax operating income of $9.34 billion increased 15% versus the same period last year as international pretax operating income of $6.88 billion increased 24%, while North America pretax operating income of $2.7 billion was flat. Pretax operating margin of 20.6% increased 119 bps, as international pretax operating margin expanded 225 bps to 22.2% while North America pretax operating margin declined 55 bps to 19.7%. The expansion in international margins was due to increased high-margin exploration, seismic and deepwater activities while the North American margin contraction was due to continued pricing pressure. Reservoir Characterization Group Full-year revenue of $12.25 billion was 10% higher than the same period last year led by Testing Services, WesternGeco, Wireline and SIS Technologies primarily due to market share gains and higher exploration activity in both offshore and key international land markets. Pretax operating margin increased 228 bps to 29.8% largely due to the higher-margin exploration activities that benefited Testing Services and Wireline Technologies. 18 Drilling Group Full-year revenue of $17.32 billion was 9% higher than the previous year primarily due to the robust demand for Drilling & Measurements services as offshore drilling activity strengthened in the US Gulf of Mexico, Sub-Sahara Africa, Russia and the Middle East & Asia Area and rig count increases in key international land markets, namely in Saudi Arabia, China and Australia. Drilling Tools & Remedial and M-I SWACO Technologies expanded across all Areas and IPM increased on projects in Iraq, Australia and Argentina. Pretax operating margin increased 156 bps to 19.1% primarily due to Drilling & Measurements, which benefited from higher-margin exploration activities both in North America offshore and in the international markets. Production Group Full-year revenue of $15.93 billion increased 8% year-on-year on increased Well Intervention activity and strong international sales of Completion and Artificial Lift products and Well Services technologies. SPM also posted strong growth. While North America land rig count declined, well and stage counts increased through drilling efficiency. Despite the efficiency-driven activity increase, Well Services revenue in North America declined due to pricing weakness. Pretax operating margin increased slightly by 72 bps to 16.4%. Margin expanded as a result of improved profitability in SPM, Completions and Artificial Lift, partially offset by a margin decline in Well Services technologies, primarily in North America, as a result of pricing pressure and cost inflation.

(4) Charges and credits are described in detail in Note 3 to the Consolidated Financial Statements . Oilfield Services Full-year 2012 revenue of $41.73 billion increased 14% versus the same period last year with North America Area 9% higher and international activity 16% higher. Internationally, higher exploration and development activities in a number of GeoMarkets both offshore and in key land markets contributed to the increase. The increase was led by the Europe/CIS/Africa Area which increased 18%, mainly in Russia and in the Nigeria & Gulf of Guinea, Angola, the East Africa and North Sea GeoMarkets. Latin America was higher by 17%, mainly in the Mexico & Central America; Venezuela, Trinidad & Tobago; and Ecuador GeoMarkets driven by strong IPM activity on land and robust offshore activity for Wireline and Drilling Group services and products. Middle East & Asia increased 14% on strong results in the Saudi Arabia & Bahrain; Australasia; Brunei, Malaysia & Philippines; and China GeoMarkets. The increase in North America was due to strong growth in North America offshore driven by robust deepwater and exploration activity that benefited the Reservoir Characterization and Drilling Groups Technologies. There was also an improvement in activity in North America land for the Production Group Technologies although the increase slowed in the second half of the year due to the weakness in the hydraulic fracturing market. Full-year 2012 pretax operating income of $8.1 billion increased 15% year-on-year as international pretax operating income of $5.6 billion increased 32% while North America pretax operating income of $2.7 billion declined by 10% year-on-year. Pretax operating margin was essentially flat at 19.5% as international pretax operating margin expanded 238 bps to 20.0% while North America pretax operating margin declined 441 bps to 20.2%. Europe/CIS/Africa posted a 435 bps improvement to reach 19.6% and Latin America increased 175 bps to 18.4% and Middle East & Asia reported a 48 bps increase to 21.9%. North America margin decline was due to Well Services production technologies, as a result of pricing pressure and cost inflation. Reservoir Characterization Group Full-year revenue of $11.16 billion was 15% higher than the same period last year led by Wireline, Testing Services, WesternGeco and SIS Technologies driven by improved offshore exploration activities across all Areas. Pretax operating margin increased 340 bps to 27.5% largely due to the higher-margin exploration activities that benefited Wireline and Testing Services, higher SIS software sales, higher WesternGeco marine vessel utilization and improved UniQ land seismic productivity. 20 Drilling Group Full-year revenue of $15.89 billion was 15% higher than the previous year primarily due to the significantly improved exploration and development activities of M-I SWACO, Drilling & Measurements, and the other Drilling Group Technologies in North America offshore and in the international markets. Pretax operating margin increased 145 bps to 17.6% primarily due to the increase in higher-margin activities of Drilling & Measurements, M-I SWACO and Drilling Tools & Remedial technologies - all of which benefited from exploration activities in North America offshore and in the international markets - mainly in the Europe/CIS/Africa Area. Production Group Full-year revenue of $14.80 billion increased 14% year-on-year, both in North America and the international markets. Well Intervention, Artificial Lift and Completions Technologies posted strong growth across all Areas. Well Services grew both in North America and internationally, with international growth led by Latin America and Europe/CIS/Africa. Pretax operating margin decreased 388 bps to 15.7% mainly due to a decline in margins for Well Services production technologies, primarily in North America, as a result of pricing pressure and cost inflation. This was mitigated by margin expansion for the other Production Group Technologies led by Well Intervention Services and Completions. Interest and Other Income Interest and other income consisted of the following: (Stated in millions) 2013 2012 2011 Interest income $ 33 $ 30 $ 40 Equity in net earnings of affiliated companies 132 142 90 $ 165 $ 172 $ 130 Interest Expense Interest expense of $391 million in 2013 increased by $51 million compared to 2012 primarily due to an increase in the weighted average debt balance of approximately $1.2 billion combined with a 0.1% increase in the weighted average borrowing rates from 3.1% in 2012 to 3.2% in 2013. Interest expense of $340 million in 2012 increased by $42 million compared to 2011 primarily due to the $1 billion of 1.25% Senior Notes due 2017 and $1 billion of 2.40% Senior Notes due 2022 that Schlumberger issued during 2012. Other Research & engineering and General & administrative expenses, as a percentage of Revenue , were as follows: 2013 2012 2011 Research & engineering 2.6 % 2.8 % 2.9 % General & administrative 0.9 % 1.0 % 1.1 % Income Taxes The Schlumberger effective tax rate was 21.3% in 2013, 24.4% in 2012, and 24.8% in 2011. The Schlumberger effective tax rate is sensitive to the geographic mix of earnings. When the percentage of pretax earnings generated outside of North America increases, the Schlumberger effective tax rate will generally decrease. Conversely, when the percentage of pretax earnings generated outside of North America decreases, the Schlumberger effective tax rate will generally increase. The effective tax rate for 2013 was significantly impacted by the charges and credits described in Note 3 to the Consolidated Financial Statements . These charges and credits reduced the effective tax rate in 2013 by approximately two percentage points. The decrease in the effective tax rate, excluding the impact of the charges and credits, from 2012 to 2013 was primarily attributable to the fact that Schlumberger generated a smaller proportion of its pretax earnings in North America in 2013 as compared to 2012. 21 Charges and Credits Schlumberger recorded significant charges and credits in continuing operations during 2013, 2012 and 2011. These charges and credits, which are summarized below, are more fully described in Note 3 to the Consolidated Financial Statements .

During the fourth quarter of 2013, Schlumberger issued 0.5 billion of 1.50% Guaranteed Notes due 2019. During the second quarter of 2013, Schlumberger paid Cameron $600 million in connection with the formation of the OneSubsea joint venture. During the third quarter of 2012, Schlumberger issued $1 billion of 1.25% Senior Notes due 2017 and $1 billion of 2.40% Senior Notes due 2022. 23 During the third quarter of 2012, Schlumberger completed the divestiture of its 56% interest in CE Franklin Ltd. for $122 million in cash. During the second quarter of 2012, Schlumberger completed the divestiture of its Wilson distribution business for $906 million in cash. During the third quarter of 2011, Schlumberger issued $1.1 billion of 1.95% Senior Notes due 2016, $1.6 billion of 3.30% Senior Notes due 2021 and $300 million of Floating Rate Senior Notes due 2014 that bear interest at a rate equal to three-month LIBOR plus 55 bps per year. During the second quarter of 2011, Schlumberger completed the divestiture of its Global Connectivity Services business for approximately $385 million in cash. During the first quarter of 2011, Schlumberger issued $1.1 billion of 4.20% Senior Notes due 2021 and $500 million of 2.65% Senior Notes due 2016. During the first quarter of 2011, Schlumberger repurchased all of its outstanding 9.75% Senior Notes due 2019, 8.625% Senior Notes due 2014 and 6.00% Senior Notes due 2016 for approximately $1.26 billion. On April 17, 2008, the Schlumberger Board of Directors (the Board ) approved an $8 billion share repurchase program for shares of Schlumberger common stock, to be acquired in the open market before December 31, 2011. On July 21, 2011, the Board approved an extension of this repurchase program to December 31, 2013. This program was completed during the third quarter of 2013. On July 18, 2013, the Board approved a new $10 billion share repurchase program to be completed at the latest by June 30, 2018. Schlumberger had repurchased $1.7 billion of shares under this program as of December 31, 2013. The following table summarizes the activity under this share repurchase program during 2013, 2012 and 2011: (Stated in thousands, except per share amounts) Total cost of shares purchased Total number of shares purchased Average price paid per share 2013 $ 2,596,447 31,349.5 $ 82.82 2012 $ 971,883 14,087.8 $ 68.99 2011 $ 2,997,688 36,940.4 $ 81.15 Net cash provided by operating activities was $9.8 billion in 2013, $6.5 billion in 2012 and $5.9 billion in 2011. The improvement in net cash flow from operating activities in 2013 reflected a strong working capital performance despite an 8.5% increase in revenue. Overall, working capital was essentially flat year-on-year with an increase in receivables largely offset by a decrease in inventory and an increase in accounts payable and accrued liabilities. From time to time in recent years, Schlumberger has experienced delays in payment from its national oil company customer in Venezuela. Schlumberger operates in approximately 85 countries. At December 31, 2013, only five of those countries (including Venezuela) individually accounted for greater than 5% of Schlumberger accounts receivable balance of which only one, the United States, represented greater than 10%. Dividends paid during 2013, 2012 and 2011 were $1.61 billion, $1.43 billion and $1.30 billion, respectively. On January 16, 2014, Schlumberger announced that its Board had approved an increase in the quarterly dividend of 28%, to $0.40. On January 17, 2013, Schlumberger announced that its Board had approved an increase in the quarterly dividend of 13.6%, to $0.3125. On January 19, 2012, Schlumberger announced that its Board had approved an increase in the quarterly dividend of 10%, to $0.275. Capital expenditures were $3.9 billion in 2013, $4.7 billion in 2012 and $4.0 billion in 2011. Capital expenditures are expected to approach $3.8 billion for the full year 2014. During 2013, 2012 and 2011 Schlumberger made contributions of $538 million, $673 million and $601 million, respectively, to its postretirement benefit plans. The US pension plans were 96% funded at December 31, 2013 based on the projected benefit obligation. This compares to 82% funded at December 31, 2012. Schlumberger international defined benefit pension plans are a combined 104% funded at December 31, 2013 based on the projected benefit obligation. This compares to 88% funded at December 31, 2012. 24 Schlumberger currently anticipates contributing approximately $500 million to its postretirement benefit plans in 2014, subject to market and business conditions. Schlumberger maintains a 5.0 billion Guaranteed Euro Medium Term Note program. This program provides for the issuance of various types of debt instruments such as fixed or floating rate notes in Euro, US dollar or other currencies. Schlumberger has issued 0.5 billion 1.50% Guranteed Notes due 2019, 1.0 billion 2.75% Guaranteed Notes due 2015 and 1.0 billion 4.50% Guaranteed Notes due 2014 under this program. As of December 31, 2013, Schlumberger had $8.4 billion of cash and short-term investments on hand. Schlumberger had separate committed debt facility agreements aggregating $4.0 billion with commercial banks, of which $3.7 billion was available and unused as of December 31, 2013. This included $3.5 billion of committed facilities which support commercial paper borrowings in Europe. Schlumberger believes that these amounts are sufficient to meet future business requirements for at least the next 12 months. The total outstanding commercial paper borrowings were $95 million as of December 31, 2013. Schlumberger did not have any commercial paper borrowings outstanding as of December 31, 2012.

(2) Excludes interest on $1.9 billion of variable rate debt, which had a weighted average interest rate of 2.8% as of December 31, 2013. (3) Represents an estimate of contractual obligations in the ordinary course of business. Although these contractual obligations are considered enforceable and legally binding, the terms generally allow Schlumberger the option to reschedule and adjust its requirements based on business needs prior to the delivery of goods. Refer to Note 18 Pension and Other Benefit Plans of the Consolidated Financial Statements for details regarding Schlumberger pension and other postretirement benefit obligations. As discussed in Note 14 Income Taxes of the Consolidated Financial Statements , included in the Schlumberger Consolidated Balance Sheet at December 31, 2013 is approximately $1.45 billion of liabilities associated with uncertain tax positions in the over 100 jurisdictions in which Schlumberger conducts business. Due to the uncertain and complex application of tax regulations, combined with the difficulty in predicting when tax audits throughout the world may be concluded, Schlumberger cannot make reliable estimates of the timing of cash outflows relating to these liabilities. Schlumberger has outstanding letters of credit/guarantees which relate to business performance bonds, custom/excise tax commitments, facility lease/rental obligations, etc. These were entered into in the ordinary course of business and are customary practices in the various countries where Schlumberger operates. Critical Accounting Policies and Estimates The preparation of financial statements and related disclosures in conformity with accounting principles generally accepted in the United States requires Schlumberger to make estimates and assumptions that affect the reported amounts of assets and liabilities, the disclosure of contingent assets and liabilities and the reported amounts of revenue and expenses. The following accounting policies involve critical accounting estimates because they are particularly dependent on estimates and assumptions made by Schlumberger about matters that are inherently uncertain. A summary of all of Schlumberger significant accounting policies is included in Note 2 to the Consolidated Financial Statements . Schlumberger bases its estimates on historical experience and on various assumptions that are believed to be reasonable under the circumstances, the results of which form the basis for making judgments about the carrying values of assets and liabilities that are not readily apparent from other sources. Actual results may differ from these estimates under different assumptions or conditions. 25 Multiclient Seismic Data The WesternGeco business capitalizes the costs associated with obtaining multiclient seismic data. The carrying value of the multiclient seismic data library at December 31, 2013 and 2012 was $667 million and $518 million, respectively. Such costs are charged to Cost of revenue based on the percentage of the total costs to the estimated total revenue that Schlumberger expects to receive from the sales of such data. However, under no circumstances will an individual survey carry a net book value greater than a 4-year, straight-line amortized value. The carrying value of surveys is reviewed for impairment annually as well as when an event or change in circumstance indicates an impairment may have occurred. Adjustments to the carrying value are recorded when it is determined that estimated future revenues, which involve significant judgment on the part of Schlumberger, would not be sufficient to recover the carrying value of the surveys. Significant adverse changes in Schlumberger estimated future cash flows could result in impairment charges in a future period. For purposes of performing the annual impairment test of the multiclient library, larger surveys, which are typically prefunded by customers, are analyzed for impairment on a survey by survey basis and other smaller surveys are analyzed based on two pools of surveys: United States and non-United States. The United States and non-United States pools were determined to be the most appropriate level at which to perform the impairment review based upon a number of factors including (i) various macroeconomic factors that influence the ability to successfully market surveys and (ii) the focus of the sales force and related costs. Allowance for Doubtful Accounts Schlumberger maintains an allowance for doubtful accounts in order to record accounts receivable at their net realizable value. Judgment is involved in recording and making adjustments to this reserve. Allowances have been recorded for receivables believed to be uncollectible, including amounts for the resolution of potential credit and other collection issues such as disputed invoices. Depending on how such potential issues are resolved, or if the financial condition of Schlumberger customers were to deteriorate resulting in an impairment of their ability to make payments, adjustments to the allowance may be required. Goodwill, Intangible Assets and Long-Lived Assets Schlumberger records the excess of purchase price over the fair value of the tangible and identifiable intangible assets acquired as goodwill. The goodwill relating to each of Schlumberger reporting units is tested for impairment annually as well as when an event, or change in circumstances, indicates an impairment may have occurred. Under generally accepted accounting principles, Schlumberger has the option to first assess qualitative factors to determine whether the existence of events or circumstances leads to a determination that it is more likely than not that the fair value of one of its reporting units is greater than its carrying amount. If, after assessing the totality of events or circumstances, Schlumberger determines it is more likely than not that the fair value of a reporting unit is greater than its carrying amount, then there is no need to perform any further testing. However, if Schlumberger concludes otherwise, then it is required to perform the first step of a two-step impairment test by calculating the fair value of the reporting unit and comparing the fair value with the carrying amount of the reporting unit. If the fair value of the reporting unit is less than its carrying value, an impairment loss is recorded to the extent that the implied fair value of the goodwill of the reporting unit is less than its carrying value. Schlumberger has the option to bypass the qualitative assessment for any reporting unit in any period and proceed directly to performing the first step of the two-step goodwill impairment test. For purposes of performing the impairment test for goodwill, Schlumberger reporting units are its three Groups: Reservoir Characterization, Drilling and Production. Schlumberger elected to perform the qualitative assessment described above for purposes of its annual goodwill impairment test. Based on this assessment, Schlumberger concluded that it was more likely than not that the fair value of each of its reporting units was greater than its carrying amount. Accordingly, no further testing was required. 26 Long-lived assets, including fixed assets and intangible assets, are reviewed for impairment whenever events or changes in circumstances indicate that the carrying value may not be recoverable. In reviewing for impairment, the carrying value of such assets is compared to the estimated undiscounted future cash flows expected from the use of the assets and their eventual disposition. If such cash flows are not sufficient to support the asset recorded value, an impairment charge is recognized to reduce the carrying value of the long-lived asset to its estimated fair value. The determination of future cash flows as well as the estimated fair value of long-lived assets involves significant estimates on the part of management. If there is a material change in economic conditions or other circumstances influencing the estimate of future cash flows or fair value, Schlumberger could be required to recognize impairment charges in the future. Income Taxes Schlumberger conducts business in more than 100 tax jurisdictions, a number of which have tax laws that are not fully defined and are evolving. Schlumberger tax filings are subject to regular audits by the tax authorities. These audits may result in assessments for additional taxes which are resolved with the authorities or, potentially, through the courts. Tax liabilities are recorded based on estimates of additional taxes which will be due upon the conclusion of these audits. Estimates of these tax liabilities are made based upon prior experience and are updated in light of changes in facts and circumstances. However, due to the uncertain and complex application of tax regulations, it is possible that the ultimate resolution of audits may result in liabilities which could be materially different from these estimates. In such an event, Schlumberger will record additional tax expense or tax benefit in the period in which such resolution occurs. Pension and Postretirement Benefits Schlumberger pension and postretirement benefit obligations are described in detail in Note 18 to the Consolidated Financial Statements . The obligations and related costs are calculated using actuarial concepts, which include critical assumptions related to the discount rate, expected rate of return on plan assets and medical cost trend rates. These assumptions are important elements of expense and/or liability measurement and are updated on an annual basis, or upon the occurrence of significant events. The discount rate Schlumberger uses reflects the prevailing market rate of a portfolio of high-quality debt instruments with maturities matching the expected timing of the payment of the benefit obligations. The following summarizes the discount rates utilized by Schlumberger for its various pension and postretirement benefit plans: The discount rate utilized to determine the liability for Schlumberger United States pension plans and postretirement medical plans was 4.85% at December 31, 2013 and 4.25% at December 31, 2012. The weighted-average discount rate utilized to determine the liability for Schlumberger international pension plans was 4.76% at December 31, 2013 and 4.38% at December 31, 2012. The weighted-average discount rate utilized to determine expense for Schlumberger United States pension plans and postretirement medical plans decreased from 5.00% in 2012 to 4.25% in 2013. The weighted-average discount rate utilized to determine expense for Schlumberger international pension plans decreased from 4.95% in 2012 to 4.38% in 2013. The expected rate of return for our retirement benefit plans represents the average rate of return expected to be earned on plan assets over the period that benefits included in the benefit obligation are expected to be paid. The expected rate of return for Schlumberger United States pension plans has been determined based upon expectations regarding future rates of return for the investment portfolio, with consideration given to the distribution of investments by asset class and historical rates of return for each individual asset class. The weighted average expected rate of return on plan assets for each of the United States and international pension plans was 7.50% in both 2013 and 2012. A lower expected rate of return would increase pension expense. Schlumberger medical cost trend rate assumptions are developed based on historical cost data, the near-term outlook and an assessment of likely long-term trends. The overall medical cost trend rate assumption utilized to determine the 2013 postretirement medical expense was 7.5% graded to 5% over the next ten years. The overall medical trend rate assumption utilized to determine the postretirement medical liability at December 31, 2013 was 7.25% graded to 5% over the next ten years. 27 The following illustrates the sensitivity to changes in certain assumptions, holding all other assumptions constant, for the United States and international pension plans: (Stated in millions) Change in Assumption Effect on 2013 Pretax Pension Expense Effect on Dec. 31, 2013 Liability 25 basis point decrease in discount rate +$ 51 +$ 366 25 basis point increase in discount rate $ 49 $ 346 25 basis point decrease in expected return on plan assets +$ 20 25 basis point increase in expected return on plan assets $ 20 The following illustrates the sensitivity to changes in certain assumptions, holding all other assumptions constant, for Schlumberger United States postretirement medical plans: (Stated in millions) Change in Assumption Effect on 2013 Pretax Postretirement Medical Expense Effect on Dec. 31, 2013 Liability 25 basis point decrease in discount rate +$ 6 +$ 46 25 basis point increase in discount rate $ 6 $ 44 100 basis point decrease per annum in medical cost trend rate $ 33 $ 195 100 basis point increase per annum in medical cost trend rate +$ 47 +$ 267 Investments in Affiliated Companies Investments in Affiliated Companies on the consolidated balance sheet primarily reflects Schlumberger investments in privately held companies, some of which are in the startup or development stages and are often still defining their strategic direction. Such investments are inherently risky and their success is dependent on factors such as technology development, market acceptance and their ability to raise additional funds. The technology being developed by these companies may never materialize and they could fail. Schlumberger monitors its portfolio to determine if any investment is other-than-temporarily impaired. If an investment is considered to be other-than-temporarily impaired, it is written down to its fair value.
