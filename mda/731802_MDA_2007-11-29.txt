ITEM 7. Management Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations INTRODUCTION This section provides management discussion of the financial condition, changes in financial condition and results of operations of Atmos Energy Corporation and its consolidated subsidiaries with specific information on results of operations and liquidity and capital resources. It includes management interpretation of our financial results, the factors affecting these results, the major factors expected to affect future operating results and future investment and financing plans. This discussion should be read in conjunction with our consolidated financial statements and notes thereto. Several factors exist that could influence our future financial performance, some of which are described in Item 1A above, Risk Factors . They should be considered in connection with evaluating forward-looking statements contained in this report or otherwise made by or on behalf of us since these factors could cause actual results and conditions to differ materially from those set out in such forward-looking statements. Cautionary Statement for the Purposes of the Safe Harbor under the Private Securities Litigation Reform Act of 1995 The statements contained in this Annual Report on Form 10-K may contain forward-looking statements within the meaning of Section 27A of the Securities Act of 1933 and Section 21E of the Securities Exchange Act of 1934. All statements other than statements of historical fact included in this Report are forward-looking statements made in good faith by us and are intended to qualify for the safe harbor from liability established by the Private Securities Litigation Reform Act of 1995. When used in this Report, or any other of our documents or oral presentations, the words anticipate , believe , estimate , expect , forecast , goal , intend , objective , plan , projection , seek , strategy or similar words are intended to identify forward-looking statements. Such forward-looking statements are subject to risks and uncertainties that could cause actual results to differ materially from those expressed or implied in the statements relating to our strategy, operations, markets, services, rates, recovery of costs, availability of gas supply and other factors. These risks and uncertainties include the following: regulatory trends and decisions, including deregulation initiatives and the impact of rate proceedings before various state regulatory commissions; market risks beyond our control affecting our risk management activities including market liquidity, commodity price volatility, increasing interest rates and counterparty creditworthiness; the concentration of our distribution, pipeline and storage operations in one state; adverse weather conditions; our ability to continue to access the capital markets; the effects of inflation and changes in the availability and prices of natural gas, including the volatility of natural gas prices; the capital-intensive nature of our distribution business, increased competition from energy suppliers and alternative forms of energy; increased costs of providing pension and postretirement health care benefits; the impact of environmental regulations on our business; the inherent hazards and risks involved in operating our distribution business, natural disasters, terrorist activities or other events, and other risks and uncertainties discussed herein, especially in Item 1A above, all of which are difficult to predict and many of which are beyond our control. Accordingly, while we believe these forward-looking statements to be reasonable, there can be no assurance that they will approximate actual experience or that the expectations derived from them will be realized. Further, we undertake no obligation to update or revise any of our forward-looking statements whether as a result of new information, future events or otherwise. CRITICAL ACCOUNTING POLICIES AND ESTIMATES Our consolidated financial statements were prepared in accordance with accounting principles generally accepted in the United States. Preparation of these financial statements requires us to make estimates and judgments that affect the reported amounts of assets, liabilities, revenues and expenses and the related disclosures of contingent assets and liabilities. We based our estimates on historical experience and various other assumptions that we believe to be reasonable under the circumstances. On an ongoing basis, we evaluate our estimates, including those related to risk management and trading activities, allowance for doubtful accounts, legal and environmental accruals, insurance accruals, pension and postretirement obligations, deferred income taxes and the valuation of goodwill, indefinite-lived intangible assets and other long-lived 32 Table of Contents assets. Our critical accounting policies are reviewed by the Audit Committee quarterly. Actual results may differ from estimates. Regulation Our natural gas distribution and regulated transmission and storage operations are subject to regulation with respect to rates, service, maintenance of accounting records and various other matters by the respective regulatory authorities in the states in which we operate. Our regulated operations are accounted for in accordance with Statement of Financial Accounting Standards (SFAS) 71, Accounting for the Effects of Certain Types of Regulation . This statement requires cost-based, rate-regulated entities that meet certain criteria to reflect the financial effects of the ratemaking and accounting practices and policies of the various regulatory commissions in their financial statements. We record regulatory assets for costs that have been deferred for which future recovery through customer rates is considered probable. Regulatory liabilities are recorded when it is probable that revenues will be reduced for amounts that will be credited to customers through the ratemaking process. As a result, certain costs that would normally be expensed under accounting principles generally accepted in the United States are permitted to be capitalized or deferred on the balance sheet because they can be recovered through rates. Discontinuing the application of SFAS 71 could significantly increase our operating expenses as fewer costs would likely be capitalized or deferred on the balance sheet, which could reduce our net income. Further, regulation may impact the period in which revenues or expenses are recognized. The amounts to be recovered or recognized are based upon historical experience and our understanding of the regulations. The impact of regulation on our natural gas distribution operations may be affected by decisions of the regulatory authorities or the issuance of new regulations. Revenue recognition Sales of natural gas to our natural gas distribution customers are billed on a monthly cycle basis; however, the billing cycle periods for certain classes of customers do not necessarily coincide with accounting periods used for financial reporting purposes. We follow the revenue accrual method of accounting for natural gas distribution segment revenues whereby revenues applicable to gas delivered to customers, but not yet billed under the cycle billing method, are estimated and accrued and the related costs are charged to expense. Revenue is recognized in our regulated transmission and storage segment as the services are provided. On occasion, we are permitted to implement new rates that have not been formally approved by our regulatory authorities and are subject to refund. As permitted by SFAS No. 71, we recognize this revenue and establish a reserve for amounts that could be refunded based on our experience for the jurisdiction in which the rates were implemented. Rates established by regulatory authorities are adjusted for increases and decreases in our purchased gas costs through purchased gas adjustment mechanisms. Purchased gas adjustment mechanisms provide gas utility companies a method of recovering purchased gas costs on an ongoing basis without filing a rate case to address all of the utility company non-gas costs. These mechanisms are commonly utilized when regulatory authorities recognize a particular type of expense, such as purchased gas costs, that (i) is subject to significant price fluctuations compared to the utility company other costs, (ii) represents a large component of the utility company cost of service and (iii) is generally outside the control of the gas utility company. There is no gross profit generated through purchased gas adjustments, but they provide a dollar-for-dollar offset to increases or decreases in utility gas costs. Although substantially all natural gas distribution sales to our customers fluctuate with the cost of gas that we purchase, our gross profit is generally not affected by fluctuations in the cost of gas as a result of the purchased gas adjustment mechanism. The effects of these purchased gas adjustment mechanisms are recorded as deferred gas costs on our balance sheet. Energy trading contracts resulting in the delivery of a commodity in which we are the principal in the transaction are recorded as natural gas marketing sales or purchases at the time of physical delivery. Realized gains and losses from the settlement of financial instruments that do not result in physical delivery related to our natural gas marketing energy trading contracts are included as a component of natural gas marketing revenues. Operating revenues for our pipeline, storage and other segment are recognized in the period in which actual volumes are transported and storage services are provided. 33 Table of Contents Allowance for doubtful accounts We record an allowance for doubtful accounts against amounts due to reduce the net receivable balance to the amount we reasonably expect to collect based upon our collections experiences and our assessment of our customers inability or reluctance to pay. However, if circumstances change, our estimate of the recoverability of accounts receivable could be different. Circumstances which could affect our estimates include, but are not limited to, customer credit issues, the level of natural gas prices and general economic conditions. Accounts are written off once they are deemed to be uncollectible. Derivatives and hedging activities Our natural gas distribution segment uses a combination of physical storage and financial derivatives to partially insulate our natural gas distribution customers against gas price volatility during the winter heating season. These financial derivatives have not been designated as hedges pursuant to SFAS 133, Accounting for Derivative Instruments and Hedging Activities . Accordingly, they are recorded at fair value. However, because the costs associated with and the gains and losses arising from these financial derivatives are included in our purchased gas adjustment mechanisms, changes in the fair value of these financial derivatives are initially recorded as a component of deferred gas costs and recognized in the consolidated statement of income as a component of purchased gas costs when the related costs are recovered through our rates in accordance with SFAS 71. Accordingly, there is no earnings impact to our natural gas distribution segment as a result of the use of financial derivatives. Our natural gas marketing and pipeline, storage and other segments are exposed to commodity price risk associated with our natural gas inventories, and, in our natural gas marketing segment, on our fixed-price contracts. We manage this risk through a combination of physical storage and financial derivatives, including futures, over-the-counter and exchange-traded options and swap contracts with counterparties. Option contracts provide the right, but not the requirement, to buy or sell the commodity at a fixed price. Swap contracts require receipt of payment for the commodity based on the difference between a fixed price and the market price on the settlement date. The use of these contracts is subject to our risk management policies, which are monitored for compliance daily. We have designated the natural gas inventory held by Atmos Energy Marketing and Atmos Pipeline and Storage, LLC as the hedged item in a fair-value hedge. This inventory is marked to market at the end of each month based on the Gas Daily index, with changes in fair value recognized as unrealized gains or losses in revenue in the period of change. The derivatives associated with this natural gas inventory have been designated as fair value hedges and are marked to market each month based upon the NYMEX price with changes in fair value recognized as unrealized gains or losses in the period of change. The difference in the spot price used to value our physical inventory (Gas Daily) and the forward price used to value the related fair-value hedges (NYMEX) are reported as a component of revenue and can result in volatility in our reported net income. We have elected to exclude this spot/forward differential for purposes of assessing the effectiveness of these fair-value hedges. We recognize revenue and the associated carrying value of the inventory (inclusive of storage costs) as purchased gas costs in our consolidated statement of income when we sell the gas and deliver it out of the storage facility. Over time, we expect gains and losses on the sale of storage gas inventory to be offset by gains and losses on the fair-value hedges, resulting in the realization of the economic gross profit margin we anticipated at the time we structured the original transaction. We have elected to treat our fixed-price forward contracts as normal purchases and sales and have designated the associated derivative contracts as cash flow hedges of anticipated transactions. Accordingly, unrealized gains and losses on these open derivative contracts are recorded as a component of accumulated other comprehensive income, and are recognized in earnings as a component of revenue when the hedged volumes are sold. Hedge ineffectiveness, to the extent incurred, is reported as a component of revenue. Additionally, our natural gas marketing segment utilizes storage swaps and futures to capture additional storage arbitrage opportunities that arise subsequent to the execution of the original fair value hedge associated with our physical natural gas inventory, basis swaps to insulate and protect the economic value of our fixed price and storage books and various over-the-counter and exchange-traded options. Although the purpose of these instruments is to either reduce basis or other risks or lock in arbitrage opportunities, these derivative 34 Table of Contents instruments have not been designated as hedges pursuant to SFAS 133. Accordingly, these derivative instruments are recorded at fair value with all changes in fair value included in revenue. In addition to mitigating commodity price risk, we periodically manage our exposure to interest rate changes by entering into Treasury lock agreements to fix the Treasury yield component of the interest cost associated with anticipated financings. We have designated each of our previously executed Treasury lock agreements as a cash flow hedge of an anticipated transaction at the time the agreements were executed. Accordingly, unrealized gains and losses associated with the Treasury lock agreements are recorded as a component of accumulated other comprehensive income. The realized gain or loss recognized upon settlement of the Treasury lock agreement is initially recorded as a component of accumulated other comprehensive income and is recognized as a component of interest expense over the life of the related financing arrangement. The fair value of all of our financial derivatives is determined through a combination of prices actively quoted on national exchanges, prices provided by other external sources and prices based on models and other valuation methods. Changes in the valuation of our financial derivatives primarily result from changes in market prices, the valuation of the portfolio of our contracts, maturity and settlement of these contracts and newly originated transactions, each of which directly affect the estimated fair value of our derivatives. We believe the market prices and models used to value these derivatives represent the best information available with respect to closing exchange and over-the-counter quotations, time value and volatility factors underlying the contracts. Values are adjusted to reflect the potential impact of an orderly liquidation of our positions over a reasonable period of time under then current market conditions. Impairment assessments We perform impairment assessments of our goodwill, intangible assets subject to amortization and long-lived assets. We currently have no indefinite-lived intangible assets. We annually evaluate our goodwill balances for impairment during our second fiscal quarter or as impairment indicators arise. We use a present value technique based on discounted cash flows to estimate the fair value of our reporting units. We have determined our reporting units to be each of our natural gas distribution divisions and wholly-owned subsidiaries. Goodwill is allocated to the reporting units responsible for the acquisition that gave rise to the goodwill. The discounted cash flow calculations used to assess goodwill impairment are dependent on several subjective factors including the timing of future cash flows, future growth rates and the discount rate. An impairment charge is recognized if the carrying value of a reporting unit goodwill exceeds its fair value. We annually assess whether the cost of our intangible assets subject to amortization or other long-lived assets is recoverable or that the remaining useful lives may warrant revision. We perform this assessment more frequently when specific events or circumstances have occurred that suggest the recoverability of the cost of the intangible and other long-lived assets is at risk. When such events or circumstances are present, we assess the recoverability of these assets by determining whether the carrying value will be recovered through expected future cash flows from the operating division or subsidiary to which these assets relate. These cash flow projections consider various factors such as the timing of the future cash flows and the discount rate and are based upon the best information available at the time the estimate is made. Changes in these factors could materially affect the cash flow projections and result in the recognition of an impairment charge. An impairment charge is recognized as the difference between the carrying amount and the fair value if the sum of the undiscounted cash flows is less than the carrying value of the related asset. Pension and other postretirement plans Pension and other postretirement plan costs and liabilities are determined on an actuarial basis and are affected by numerous assumptions and estimates including the market value of plan assets, estimates of the expected return on plan assets, assumed discount rates and current demographic and actuarial mortality data. We review the estimates and assumptions underlying our pension and other postretirement plan costs and liabilities annually based upon a June 30 measurement date. The assumed discount rate and the expected return are the assumptions that generally have the most significant impact on our pension costs and liabilities. The assumed discount rate, the assumed health care cost trend rate 35 Table of Contents and assumed rates of retirement generally have the most significant impact on our postretirement plan costs and liabilities. The discount rate is utilized principally in calculating the actuarial present value of our pension and postretirement obligation and net pension and postretirement cost. When establishing our discount rate, we consider high quality corporate bond rates based on Moody Aa bond index, changes in those rates from the prior year and the implied discount rate that is derived from matching our projected benefit disbursements with a high quality corporate bond spot rate curve. The expected long-term rate of return on assets is utilized in calculating the expected return on plan assets component of our annual pension and postretirement plan cost. We estimate the expected return on plan assets by evaluating expected bond returns, equity risk premiums, asset allocations, the effects of active plan management, the impact of periodic plan asset rebalancing and historical performance. We also consider the guidance from our investment advisors in making a final determination of our expected rate of return on assets. To the extent the actual rate of return on assets realized over the course of a year is greater than or less than the assumed rate, that year annual pension or postretirement plan cost is not affected. Rather, this gain or loss reduces or increases future pension or postretirement plan cost over a period of approximately ten to twelve years. We estimate the assumed health care cost trend rate used in determining our postretirement net expense based upon our actual health care cost experience, the effects of recently enacted legislation and general economic conditions. Our assumed rate of retirement is estimated based upon our annual review of our participant census information as of the measurement date. Actual changes in the fair market value of plan assets and differences between the actual return on plan assets and the expected return on plan assets could have a material effect on the amount of pension cost ultimately recognized. A 0.25 percent change in our discount rate would impact our pension and postretirement cost by approximately $0.9 million. A 0.25 percent change in our expected rate of return would impact our pension and postretirement cost by approximately $0.9 million. RESULTS OF OPERATIONS Overview Atmos Energy Corporation is involved in the distribution, marketing and transportation of natural gas. Accordingly, our results of operations are impacted by the demand for natural gas, particularly during the winter heating season, and the volatility of the natural gas markets. This generally results in higher operating revenues and net income during the period from October through March of each year and lower operating revenues and either lower net income or net losses during the period from April through September of each year. As a result of the seasonality of the natural gas industry, our second fiscal quarter has historically been our most critical earnings quarter with an average of approximately 63 percent of our consolidated net income having been earned in the second quarter during the three most recently completed fiscal years. Additionally, the seasonality of this industry impacts the levels of accounts receivable, accounts payable, gas stored underground and short-term debt balances we report at various time of the fiscal year. 36 Table of Contents Consolidated Results The following table presents our consolidated financial highlights for the fiscal years ended September 30, 2007, 2006 and 2005. For the Year Ended September 30 2007 2006 2005 (In thousands, except per share data) Operating revenues $ 5,898,431 $ 6,152,363 $ 4,961,873 Gross profit 1,250,082 1,216,570 1,117,637 Operating expenses 851,446 833,954 768,982 Operating income 398,636 382,616 348,655 Miscellaneous income 9,184 881 2,021 Interest charges 145,236 146,607 132,658 Income before income taxes 262,584 236,890 218,018 Income tax expense 94,092 89,153 82,233 Net income $ 168,492 $ 147,737 $ 135,785 Earnings per diluted share $ 1.92 $ 1.82 $ 1.72 Historically, our regulated operations arising from our natural gas distribution operations and, beginning in fiscal 2005, from our Atmos Pipeline Texas division, contributed 65 to 85 percent of our consolidated net income. However, in recent years, this contribution has declined due to the growth of our nonregulated natural gas marketing and pipeline and storage businesses coupled with lower natural gas distribution income. Regulated operations contributed 64 percent, 54 percent and 80 percent to our consolidated net income for fiscal years 2007, 2006 and 2005. Our consolidated net income during the last three fiscal years was earned across our business segments as follows: For the Year Ended September 30 2007 2006 2005 (In thousands) Natural gas distribution segment $ 73,283 $ 53,002 $ 81,117 Regulated transmission and storage segment 34,590 26,547 27,582 Natural gas marketing segment 45,769 58,566 23,404 Pipeline, storage and other segment 14,850 9,622 3,682 Net income $ 168,492 $ 147,737 $ 135,785 The following table segregates our consolidated net income and diluted earnings per share between our regulated and nonregulated operations: For the Year Ended September 30 2007 2006 2005 (In thousands, except per share data) Regulated operations $ 107,873 $ 79,549 $ 108,699 Nonregulated operations 60,619 68,188 27,086 Consolidated net income $ 168,492 $ 147,737 $ 135,785 Diluted EPS from regulated operations $ 1.23 $ 0.98 $ 1.38 Diluted EPS from nonregulated operations 0.69 0.84 0.34 Consolidated diluted EPS $ 1.92 $ 1.82 $ 1.72 The 14 percent year-over-year increase in net income during fiscal 2007 reflects improvements across all business segments. Results from our regulated operations reflect the net favorable impact of various ratemaking rulings in our natural gas distribution segment, including the implementation of WNA in our Mid- 37 Table of Contents Tex and Louisiana Divisions coupled with increased throughput and incremental gross profit margins from our North Side Loop and other pipeline compression projects completed in fiscal 2006. The decrease in net income from our nonregulated operations primarily reflects the impact of a less volatile natural gas market, which reduced delivered gas margins despite a 31 percent increase in sales volumes. However, our nonregulated operations benefited from higher asset optimization margins, primarily in the pipeline, storage and other segment. The nine percent year-over-year increase in net income during fiscal 2006 primarily reflects strong results in our nonregulated operations, partially offset by a decrease in our regulated operations. The net income from our nonregulated operations reflect the favorable impact of a volatile natural gas market, which provided increased opportunities to maximize delivered gas margins. Our nonregulated results were also favorably impacted by recording unrealized gains during fiscal 2006 compared to recording unrealized losses in fiscal 2005. The decrease in net income from our regulated operations primarily reflects the adverse effects on our natural gas distribution segment of weather (adjusted for WNA) that was 13 percent warmer than normal, the adverse effect of Hurricane Katrina on our Louisiana Division and a non-recurring, noncash charge to impair our West Texas Division irrigation assets. Other key financial and significant events for the year ended September 30, 2007 include the following: In December 2006, we filed a $900 million shelf registration statement with the SEC that replaced our previously existing shelf registration statement. Upon completion of the filing of this registration statement, we received net proceeds of approximately $192 million through the issuance of approximately 6.3 million shares of common stock. The net proceeds received were used to repay a portion of our then-existing short-term debt balance. In June 2007, we received net proceeds of approximately $247 million from the issuance of senior notes. The net proceeds received, together with $53 million of available cash, were used to repay our $300 million unsecured floating rate senior notes, which were redeemed on July 15, 2007. Our total-debt-to-capitalization ratio at September 30, 2007 was 53.7 percent compared with 60.9 percent at September 30, 2006, primarily reflecting the $50 million reduction in long-term debt and lower short-term debt balances as of September 30, 2007. For the year ended September 30, 2007, we generated $547.1 million in operating cash flow compared with $311.4 million for the year ended September 30, 2006, primarily reflecting the favorable impact of increased earnings, increased sales volumes attributable to colder weather during the period and lower natural gas prices. Capital expenditures decreased to $392.4 million during the year ended September 30, 2007 from $425.3 million in the prior year. The decrease primarily reflects the absence of capital spending for the North Side Loop and other compression projects completed in fiscal 2006. In March 2007, the Texas Railroad Commission issued an order in our Mid-Tex Division rate case, which prospectively increased annual revenues by approximately $4.8 million and established a permanent WNA based upon a 10-year average effective for the months of November through April. However, the ruling also reduced the Mid-Tex Division total return to 7.903 percent from 8.258 percent and required a $2.9 million refund, inclusive of interest, of amounts collected from our calendar 2003 2005 GRIP filings. 38 Table of Contents See the following discussion regarding the results of operations for each of our business operating segments. Year ended September 30, 2007 compared with year ended September 30, 2006 Natural Gas Distribution Segment The primary factors that impact the results of our natural gas distribution operations are our ability to earn our authorized rates of return, the cost of natural gas, competitive factors in the energy industry and economic conditions in our service areas. Our ability to earn our authorized rates is based primarily on our ability to improve the rate design in our various ratemaking jurisdictions by reducing or eliminating regulatory lag and, ultimately, separating the recovery of our approved margins from customer usage patterns. Improving rate design is a long-term process and is further complicated by the fact that we operate in multiple rate jurisdictions. The Ratemaking Activity section of this Form 10-K describes our current rate strategy and recent ratemaking initiatives in more detail. One example of our recent ratemaking initiatives involves the substantial separation of the recovery of our margins from seasonal weather patterns. Prior to fiscal 2007, seasonal weather patterns significantly impacted our natural gas distribution results. The rate design in our two most weather-sensitive jurisdictions, the Louisiana and Mid-Tex divisions, which represent approximately 60 percent of our natural gas distribution residential and commercial meters, provided for limited weather protection. During fiscal 2006, we received WNA in these jurisdictions, beginning with the 2006-2007 winter heating season. WNA substantially offsets the effects of weather that is above or below normal by allowing us to increase the base rate portion of customers bills when weather is warmer than normal and to decrease the base rate when weather is colder than normal. Accordingly, gross profit margin in our service areas covered by WNA should be based substantially on the amount of gross profit that would result from normal weather, despite actual weather conditions that may be either warmer or colder than normal. After receiving WNA in our Louisiana and Mid-Tex divisions, we have weather protection for over 90 percent of our residential and commercial meters, which should substantially reduce the volatility in this segment operating results. Our natural gas distribution operations are also affected by the cost of natural gas. The cost of gas is passed through to our customers without markup. Therefore, increases in the cost of gas are offset by a corresponding increase in revenues. Accordingly, we believe gross profit is a better indicator of our financial performance than revenues. However, gross profit in our Texas and Mississippi service areas include franchise fees and gross receipts taxes, which are calculated as a percentage of revenue (inclusive of gas costs). Therefore, the amount of these taxes included in revenues is influenced by the cost of gas and the level of gas sales volumes. We record the tax expense as a component of taxes, other than income. Although changes in revenue-related taxes arising from changes in gas costs affect gross profit, over time the impact is offset within operating income. Timing differences exist between the recognition of revenue for franchise fees collected from our customers and the recognition of expense of franchise taxes. The effect of these timing differences can be significant in periods of volatile gas prices, particularly in our Mid-Tex Division. These timing differences may favorably or unfavorably affect net income; however, these amounts should offset over time with no permanent impact on net income. Higher gas costs may also adversely impact our accounts receivable collections, resulting in higher bad debt expense, and may require us to increase borrowings under our credit facilities resulting in higher interest expense. Finally, higher gas costs, as well as competitive factors in the industry and general economic conditions may cause customers to conserve or use alternative energy sources. 39 Table of Contents Review of Financial and Operating Results Financial and operational highlights for our natural gas distribution segment for the year ended September 30, 2007 and 2006 are presented below. For the Year Ended September 30 2007 2006 (In thousands, unless otherwise noted) Gross profit $ 952,684 $ 925,057 Operating expenses 731,497 723,163 Operating income 221,187 201,894 Miscellaneous income 8,945 9,506 Interest charges 121,626 126,489 Income before income taxes 108,506 84,911 Income tax expense 35,223 31,909 Net income $ 73,283 $ 53,002 Natural gas distribution sales volumes MMcf 297,327 272,033 Natural gas distribution transportation volumes MMcf 130,542 121,962 Total natural gas distribution throughput MMcf 427,869 393,995 Heating degree days Actual (weighted average) 2,879 2,527 Percent of normal 100 % 87 % Consolidated natural gas distribution average transportation revenue per Mcf $ 0.45 $ 0.50 Consolidated natural gas distribution average cost of gas per Mcf sold $ 8.09 $ 10.02 The following table shows our operating income by natural gas distribution division for the fiscal years ended September 30, 2007 and 2006. The presentation of our natural gas distribution operating income is included for financial reporting purposes and may not be appropriate for ratemaking purposes. 2007 2006 Heating Heating Operating Degree Days Degree Days Income Percent of Operating Percent of (Loss) Normal (1) Income Normal (1) (In thousands, except degree day information) Colorado-Kansas $ 22,392 104 % $ 22,524 99 % Kentucky/Mid-States 42,161 97 % 49,893 98 % Louisiana 44,193 105 % 27,772 78 % Mid-Tex 68,574 100 % 71,703 72 % Mississippi 23,225 101 % 23,276 102 % West Texas 21,036 99 % 2,215 100 % Other (394 ) 4,511 Total $ 221,187 100 % $ 201,894 87 % (1) Adjusted for service areas that have weather-normalized operations. For service areas that have weather normalized operations, normal degree days are used instead of actual degree days in computing the total number of heating degree days. 40 Table of Contents The $27.6 million increase in natural gas distribution gross profit primarily reflects a nine percent increase in throughput and the impact of having WNA coverage for more than 90 percent of our residential and commercial customers, which increased gross profit by $38.6 million. Included in this amount was a $10.8 million increase associated with the implementation of WNA in our Mid-Tex and Louisiana Divisions beginning with the 2006-2007 winter heating season. As a result of the Mid-Tex rate case, our gas distribution gross profit increased by $5.4 million compared to the prior year. This increase was partially offset by a decrease in Mid-Tex transportation revenue as the rate case reduced the transportation rates for certain customer classes. The Mid-Tex rate case also required the refund of $2.9 million collected under GRIP, which reduced gross profit in the current year. Favorable regulatory activity in the current year increased gross profit by $24.4 million, primarily due to an $11.8 million increase in GRIP-related recoveries and a $10.2 million increase from our Rate Stabilization Clause (RSC) filings in our Louisiana service areas. These increases were partially offset by an $11.6 million decrease in gross profit associated with regulatory rulings in our Tennessee, Louisiana and Virginia jurisdictions. Offsetting these increases in gross profit was a reduction in revenue-related taxes. Due to a significant decline in the cost of gas in the current-year period compared with the prior-year period, franchise and state gross receipts taxes included in gross profit decreased approximately $1.7 million; however, franchise and state gross receipts tax expense recorded as a component of taxes, other than income decreased $5.4 million, which resulted in a $3.7 million increase in operating income when compared with the prior-year period. Natural gas distribution gross profit also reflects a $7.5 million accrual for estimated unrecoverable gas costs. The remaining decrease in gross profit primarily is attributable to lower irrigation margins and a reduction in pass-through surcharges used to recover various costs as these costs were fully recovered by the end of fiscal 2006 and during fiscal 2007. Operating expenses, which include operation and maintenance expense, provision for doubtful accounts, depreciation and amortization expense, taxes, other than income, and impairment of long-lived assets, increased to $731.5 million for the year ended September 30, 2007 from $723.2 million for the year ended September 30, 2006. Operation and maintenance expense, excluding the provision for doubtful accounts, increased $22.4 million, primarily due to increased employee and other administrative costs. These increases include the personnel and other operating costs associated with the transfer of our gas supply function from our pipeline, storage and other segment to our natural gas distribution segment effective January 1, 2007. Partially offsetting these increases was the deferral of $4.3 million of operation and maintenance expense in our Louisiana Division resulting from the Louisiana Public Service Commission ruling to allow recovery of all incremental operation and maintenance expense incurred in fiscal 2005 and 2006 in connection with our Hurricane Katrina recovery efforts. The provision for doubtful accounts decreased $0.8 million to $19.8 million for the year ended September 30, 2007. The decrease primarily was attributable to reduced collection risk as a result of lower natural gas prices. In the natural gas distribution segment, the average cost of natural gas for the year ended September 30, 2007 was $8.09 per Mcf, compared with $10.02 per Mcf for the year ended September 30, 2006. Depreciation and amortization expense increased $12.7 million for the year ended September 30, 2007 compared with the prior-year period. The increase was primarily attributable to increases in assets placed in service during fiscal 2007. Additionally, the increase was partially attributable to the absence in the current-year period of a $2.8 million reduction in depreciation expense recorded in the prior-year period arising from the Mississippi Public Service Commission decision to allow certain deferred costs in our rate base. Operating expenses for the year ended September 30, 2007 included a $3.3 million noncash charge associated with the write-off of costs for software that will no longer be used. Fiscal 2006 results included a $22.9 million noncash charge to impair the West Texas Division irrigation properties. 41 Table of Contents Interest charges Interest charges allocated to the natural gas distribution segment for the year ended September 30, 2007 decreased to $121.6 million from $126.5 million for the year ended September 30, 2006. The decrease primarily was attributable to lower average outstanding short-term debt balances in the current-year period compared with the prior-year period. Regulated Transmission and Storage Segment Our regulated transmission and storage segment consists of the regulated pipeline and storage operations of the Atmos Pipeline Texas Division. The Atmos Pipeline Texas Division transports natural gas to our Mid-Tex Division and third parties and manages five underground storage reservoirs in Texas. We also provide ancillary services customary in the pipeline industry including parking arrangements, lending and sales of inventory on hand. Similar to our natural gas distribution segment, our regulated transmission and storage segment is impacted by seasonal weather patterns, competitive factors in the energy industry and economic conditions in our service areas. Further, as the Atmos Pipeline Texas Division operations supply all of the natural gas for our Mid-Tex Division, the results of this segment are highly dependent upon the natural gas requirements of the Mid-Tex Division. Finally, as a regulated pipeline, the operations of the Atmos Pipeline Texas Division may be impacted by the timing of when costs and expenses are incurred and when these costs and expenses are recovered through its tariffs. Review of Financial and Operating Results Financial and operational highlights for our regulated transmission and storage segment for the years ended September 30, 2007 and 2006 are presented below. For the Year Ended September 30 2007 2006 (In thousands, unless otherwise noted) Mid-Tex transportation $ 77,090 $ 69,925 Third-party transportation 65,158 56,813 Storage and park and lend services 9,374 8,047 Other 11,607 6,348 Gross profit 163,229 141,133 Operating expenses 83,399 77,807 Operating income 79,830 63,326 Miscellaneous income (expense) 2,105 (153 ) Interest charges 27,917 22,787 Income before income taxes 54,018 40,386 Income tax expense 19,428 13,839 Net income $ 34,590 $ 26,547 Pipeline transportation volumes MMcf 505,493 410,505 The $22.1 million increase in gross profit primarily is attributable to a 23 percent increase in throughput due to colder weather in the current year and incremental volumes from the North Side Loop and other compression projects. These activities increased gross profit by $16.2 million, of which, $10.8 million was associated with our North Side Loop and other compression projects completed in fiscal 2006. Increases in gross profit also include a $3.1 million increase from rate adjustments resulting from our 2005 GRIP filing, a 42 Table of Contents $2.1 million increase from the sale of excess gas inventory and a $2.0 million increase from new or renegotiated blending and capacity enhancement contracts. Operating expenses increased to $83.4 million for the year ended September 30, 2007 from $77.8 million for the year ended September 30, 2006 due to higher administrative and other operating costs primarily associated with the North Side Loop and other compression projects that were completed in fiscal 2006. Interest charges Interest charges allocated to the pipeline and storage segment for the year ended September 30, 2007 increased to $27.9 million from $22.8 million for the year ended September 30, 2006. The increase was attributable to the use of updated allocation factors for fiscal 2007. These factors are reviewed and updated on an annual basis. Natural Gas Marketing Segment Our natural gas marketing segment aggregates and purchases gas supply, arranges transportation and/or storage logistics and ultimately delivers gas to our customers at competitive prices. To facilitate this process, we utilize proprietary and customer-owned transportation and storage assets to provide the various services our customers request, including furnishing natural gas supplies at fixed and market-based prices, contract negotiation and administration, load forecasting, gas storage acquisition and management services, transportation services, peaking sales and balancing services, capacity utilization strategies and gas price hedging through the use of derivative products. As a result, revenues and gross profit from this segment arise from the types of commercial transactions we have structured with our customers and include the value we extract by optimizing the storage and transportation capacity we own or control as well as revenues for services we perform. To optimize the storage and transportation capacity we own or control, we participate in transactions in which we combine the natural gas commodity and transportation costs to minimize our costs incurred to serve our customers by identifying the lowest cost alternative within the natural gas supplies, transportation and markets to which we have access. Additionally, we engage in natural gas storage transactions in which we seek to find and profit from the pricing differences that occur over time. We purchase physical natural gas and then sell financial contracts at favorable prices to lock in gross profit margins. Through the use of transportation and storage services and derivative contracts, we seek to capture gross profit margin through the arbitrage of pricing differences in various locations and by recognizing pricing differences that occur over time. AEM continually manages its net physical position to enhance the future economic profit it captured when an original transaction was executed. Therefore, AEM may change its scheduled injection and withdrawal plans from one time period to another based on market conditions or adjust the amount of storage capacity it holds on a discretionary basis in an effort to achieve this objective. The natural gas inventory used in our natural gas marketing storage activities is marked to market at the end of each month based upon the Gas Daily index with changes in fair value recognized as unrealized gains and losses in the period of change. We use derivatives, designated as fair value hedges, to hedge this natural gas inventory. These derivatives are marked to market each month based upon the NYMEX price with changes in fair value recognized as unrealized gains and losses in the period of change. The changes between the spreads between the forward natural gas prices used to value the financial hedges designated against our physical inventory and the market (spot) prices used to value our physical storage result in the unrealized margins reported as a part of our storage activities until the underlying physical gas is cycled and the related financial derivatives are settled. AEM also uses derivative instruments to capture additional storage arbitrage opportunities that arise subsequent to the execution of the original physical inventory hedge and to insulate and protect the economic value within its storage and marketing activities. Changes in fair value associated with these financial 43 Table of Contents instruments are recognized as unrealized gains and losses within AEM storage and marketing activities until they are settled. Review of Financial and Operating Results Financial and operational highlights for our natural gas marketing segment for the years ended September 30, 2007 and 2006 are presented below. Gross profit margin for our natural gas marketing segment consists primarily of margins earned from the delivery of gas and related services requested by our customers; and asset optimization activities, which are derived from the utilization of our managed proprietary and third party storage and transportation assets to capture favorable arbitrage spreads through natural gas trading activities. Unrealized margins represent the unrealized gains or losses on the derivative contracts used by our natural gas marketing segment to manage commodity price risk as described above. These margins fluctuate based upon changes in the spreads between the physical and forward natural gas prices. Generally, if the physical/financial spread narrows, we will record unrealized gains or lower unrealized losses. If the physical/financial spread widens, we will record unrealized losses or lower unrealized gains. The magnitude of the unrealized gains and losses is also contingent upon the levels of our net physical position at the end of the reporting period. For the Year Ended September 30 2007 2006 (In thousands, unless otherwise noted) Delivered gas $ 57,054 $ 87,236 Asset optimization 28,827 26,225 Unrealized margins 18,430 17,166 Gross profit 104,311 130,627 Operating expenses 29,271 28,392 Operating income 75,040 102,235 Miscellaneous income 6,434 2,598 Interest charges 5,767 8,510 Income before income taxes 75,707 96,323 Income tax expense 29,938 37,757 Net income $ 45,769 $ 58,566 Natural gas marketing sales volumes MMcf 370,668 283,962 Net physical position (Bcf) 12.3 14.5 The $26.3 million decrease in our natural gas marketing segment gross profit primarily reflects lower delivered gas margins, partially offset by higher asset optimization margins. Delivered gas margins decreased $30.2 million compared with the prior-year period. This decrease reflects the impact of a less volatile market, which reduced opportunities to take advantage of pricing differences between hubs, partially offset by a 31 percent increase in sales volumes attributable to successful execution of our marketing strategies and colder weather in the current fiscal year compared with the prior year. Asset optimization margins increased $2.6 million compared with the prior-year period. The increase reflects greater cycled storage volumes during the current-year period, partially offset by an increase in storage fees and park and loan fees which reduced the arbitrage spreads available. Operating expenses, which include operation and maintenance expense, provision for doubtful accounts, depreciation and amortization expense and taxes other than income taxes, increased to $29.3 million for the 44 Table of Contents year ended September 30, 2007 from $28.4 million for the year ended September 30, 2006. The increase in operating expense primarily was attributable to an increase in employee and other administrative costs. Miscellaneous income Miscellaneous income increased to $6.4 million for the year ended September 30, 2007 from $2.6 million for the year ended September 30, 2006. The increase primarily was attributable to increased investment income earned on overnight investments during the current-year period combined with increased interest income earned on our margin account associated with increased margin requirements during the current year. Interest charges Interest charges for the year ended September 30, 2007 decreased to $5.8 million from $8.5 million for the year ended September 30, 2006. The decrease was attributable to lower borrowing requirements during the current-year period. Economic Gross Profit AEM monitors the impacts of its asset optimization efforts by estimating the gross profit that it captured through the purchase and sale of physical natural gas and the associated financial derivatives. The reconciliation below of the economic gross profit, combined with the effect of unrealized gains or losses recognized in accordance with generally accepted accounting principles in the financial statements in prior periods, is presented to provide a measure of the potential gross profit from asset optimization that could occur in future periods if AEM optimization efforts are executed as planned. We consider this measure of potential gross profit a non-GAAP financial measure as it is calculated using both forward-looking and historical financial information. The following table presents AEM economic gross profit and its potential gross profit for the last three fiscal years. Associated Net Net Physical Economic Gross Unrealized Gain Potential Gross Period Ending Position Profit (Loss) Profit (Bcf) (In millions) (In millions) (In millions) September 30, 2007 12.3 $ 40.8 $ 10.8 $ 30.0 September 30, 2006 14.5 $ 60.0 $ (16.0 ) $ 76.0 September 30, 2005 6.9 $ 13.1 $ (14.8 ) $ 27.9 As of September 30, 2007, based upon AEM derivatives position and inventory withdrawal schedule, the economic gross profit was $40.8 million. This amount is reduced by $10.8 million of net unrealized gains recorded in the financial statements as of September 30, 2007 that will reverse when the inventory is withdrawn and the accompanying financial derivatives are settled. Therefore, the potential gross profit was $30.0 million. This potential gross profit amount will not result in an equal increase in future net income as AEM will incur additional storage and other operational expenses and increased income taxes to realize this amount. The economic gross profit is based upon planned injection and withdrawal schedules, and the realization of the economic gross profit is contingent upon the execution of this plan, weather and other execution factors. Since AEM actively manages and optimizes its portfolio to enhance the future profitability of its storage position, it may change its scheduled injection and withdrawal plans from one time period to another based on market conditions. Therefore, we cannot ensure that the economic gross profit or the potential gross profit calculated as of September 30, 2007 will be fully realized in the future or in what time period. Further, if we experience operational or other issues which limit our ability to optimally manage our stored gas positions, our earnings could be adversely impacted. 45 Table of Contents Pipeline, Storage and Other Segment Our pipeline, storage and other segment primarily consists of the operations of Atmos Pipeline and Storage, LLC (APS), Atmos Energy Services, LLC (AES) and Atmos Power Systems, Inc., which are each wholly-owned by AEH. APS owns or has an interest in underground storage fields in Kentucky and Louisiana. We use these storage facilities to reduce the need to contract for additional pipeline capacity to meet customer demand during peak periods. Additionally, beginning in fiscal 2006, APS initiated activities in the natural gas gathering business. As of September 30, 2007, these activities were limited in nature. AES, through December 31, 2006, provided natural gas management services to our natural gas distribution operations, other than the Mid-Tex Division. These services included aggregating and purchasing gas supply, arranging transportation and storage logistics and ultimately delivering the gas to our natural gas distribution service areas at competitive prices. Effective January 1, 2007, these activities were moved to our shared services function included in our natural gas distribution segment. AES continues to provide limited services to our natural gas distribution divisions, and the revenues AES receives are equal to the costs incurred to provide those services. Through Atmos Power Systems, Inc., we have constructed electric peaking power-generating plants and associated facilities and lease these plants through lease agreements that are accounted for as sales under generally accepted accounting principles. Results for this segment are primarily impacted by seasonal weather patterns and volatility in the natural gas markets. Additionally, this segment results include an unrealized component as APS hedges its risk associated with its asset optimization activities. Review of Financial and Operating Results Financial and operational highlights for our pipeline, storage and other segment for the years ended September 30, 2007 and 2006 are presented below. For the Year Ended September 30 2007 2006 (In thousands, unless otherwise noted) Storage and transportation services $ 15,968 $ 11,841 Asset optimization 10,751 3,387 Other 3,792 5,916 Unrealized margins 2,097 3,350 Gross profit 32,608 24,494 Operating expenses 10,373 9,570 Operating income 22,235 14,924 Miscellaneous income 8,173 6,858 Interest charges 6,055 6,512 Income before income taxes 24,353 15,270 Income tax expense 9,503 5,648 Net income $ 14,850 $ 9,622 Pipeline transportation volumes MMcf 4,150 5,439 Gross profit increased $8.1 million primarily due to APS ability to capture more favorable arbitrage spreads from its asset optimization activities, an increase in asset optimization contracts and increased transportation margins. 46 Table of Contents Operating expenses increased to $10.4 million for the year ended September 30, 2007 from $9.6 million for the year ended September 30, 2006 primarily due to a $3.0 million noncash charge associated with the write-off of costs associated with a natural gas gathering project. This increase was partially offset by a decrease in employee and other administrative costs associated with the transfer of gas supply operations from the pipeline, storage and other segment to our natural gas distribution segment effective January 1, 2007. Miscellaneous income Miscellaneous income increased to $8.2 million for the year ended September 30, 2007 from $6.9 million for the year ended September 30, 2006. The increase was primarily attributable to $2.1 million received from leasing certain mineral interests coupled with an increase in interest income recorded in the pipeline, storage and other segment. Interest charges Interest charges allocated to the pipeline, storage and other segment for the year ended September 30, 2007 decreased to $6.1 million from $6.5 million for the year ended September 30, 2006. The decrease was attributable to the use of updated allocation factors for fiscal 2007. These factors are reviewed and updated on an annual basis. Year ended September 30, 2006 compared with year ended September 30, 2005 Natural Gas Distribution Segment Financial and operational highlights for our natural gas distribution segment for the fiscal years ended September 30, 2006 and 2005 are presented below. For the Year Ended September 30 2006 2005 (In thousands, unless otherwise noted) Gross profit $ 925,057 $ 907,366 Operating expenses 723,163 671,001 Operating income 201,894 236,365 Miscellaneous income 9,506 6,776 Interest charges 126,489 112,382 Income before income taxes 84,911 130,759 Income tax expense 31,909 49,642 Net income $ 53,002 $ 81,117 Natural gas distribution sales volumes MMcf 272,033 296,283 Natural gas distribution transportation volumes MMcf 121,962 114,851 Total natural gas distribution throughput MMcf 393,995 411,134 Heating degree days Actual (weighted average) 2,527 2,587 Percent of normal 87 % 89 % Consolidated natural gas distribution average transportation revenue per Mcf $ 0.50 $ 0.51 Consolidated natural gas distribution average cost of gas per Mcf sold $ 10.02 $ 7.41 47 Table of Contents The following table shows our operating income by natural gas distribution division for the fiscal years ended September 30, 2006 and 2005. The presentation of our natural gas distribution operating income is included for financial reporting purposes and may not be appropriate for ratemaking purposes. 2006 2005 Heating Degree Heating Degree Operating Days Percent Operating Days Percent Income of Normal (1) Income of Normal (1) (In thousands, except degree day information) Colorado-Kansas $ 22,524 99 % $ 25,157 99 % Kentucky/Mid-States 49,893 98 % 54,344 96 % Louisiana 27,772 78 % 24,819 78 % Mid-Tex 71,703 72 % 84,965 80 % Mississippi 23,276 102 % 19,045 96 % West Texas 2,215 100 % 27,520 99 % Other 4,511 515 Total $ 201,894 87 % $ 236,365 89 % (1) Adjusted for service areas that have weather-normalized operations. For service areas that have weather normalized operations, normal degree days are used instead of actual degree days in computing the total number of heating degree days. Natural gas distribution gross profit increased to $925.1 million for the year ended September 30, 2006 from $907.4 million for the year ended September 30, 2005. Total throughput for our natural gas distribution business was 394.0 Bcf during the current year compared to 411.1 Bcf in the prior year. The increase in natural gas distribution gross profit, despite lower throughput, primarily reflects higher franchise fees and state gross receipts taxes, which are paid by customers and have no permanent effect on net income. Additionally, margins increased approximately $14.0 million due to rate increases received from our fiscal 2005 and fiscal 2004 GRIP filings and the recognition of $3.3 million that had been previously deferred in Louisiana following the LPSC ratification of our agreement in May 2006. These increases were partially offset by approximately $22.9 million due to the impact of significantly warmer than normal weather, particularly in our Mid-Tex and Louisiana divisions. For the year ended September 30, 2006, weather was 13 percent warmer than normal, as adjusted for jurisdictions with weather-normalized operations and two percent warmer than the prior year. In the Mid-Tex and Louisiana Divisions, which did not have weather-normalized rates during the 2005-2006 winter heating season, weather was 28 percent and 22 percent warmer than normal. Additionally, natural gas distribution gross profit decreased approximately $2.9 million compared with the prior year in the Louisiana Division due to the impact of Hurricane Katrina. Service has been restored in some areas affected by the storm; however, it is likely that service will not be restored to all of the affected service areas. As more fully described under Ratemaking Activity, we implemented new rates in September 2006 that reflect the impact of Hurricane Katrina. Operating expenses increased to $723.2 million for the year ended September 30, 2006 from $671.0 million for the year ended September 30, 2005. The increase reflects a $13.3 million increase in taxes, other than income, primarily related to franchise fees and state gross receipts taxes, both of which are calculated as a percentage of revenue, and are paid by our customers as a component of their monthly bills. Although these amounts are included as a component of revenue in accordance with our tariffs, timing differences between when these amounts are billed to our customers and when we recognize the associated expense may affect net income favorably or unfavorably on a temporary basis. However, there is no permanent effect on net income. Operation and maintenance expense, excluding the provision for doubtful accounts, increased $7.8 million primarily due to higher employee costs associated with increased headcount to fill positions that were previously outsourced to a third party, higher medical and dental claims and increased pension and 48 Table of Contents postretirement costs resulting from changes in the assumptions used to determine our fiscal 2006 costs. Increased line locate, telecommunication and facilities costs also contributed to the overall increase. These increases were partially offset by a reduction in third-party costs for outsourced administrative and meter reading functions that were in-sourced during fiscal 2006. Operation and maintenance expense for the year ended September 30, 2006 was also favorably impacted by the absence of $2.1 million of merger and integration cost amortization associated with the merger of United Cities Gas Company in July 1997, as these costs were fully amortized by December 2004. The provision for doubtful accounts increased $3.1 million to $20.6 million for the year ended September 30, 2006, compared with $17.5 million in the prior year. The increase was primarily attributable to increased collection risk associated with higher natural gas prices. In the natural gas distribution segment, the average cost of natural gas for the year ended September 30, 2006 was $10.02 per Mcf, compared with $7.41 per Mcf for the year ended September 30, 2005. Additionally, during the first quarter of fiscal 2006, the MPSC, in connection with the modification of our rate design, decided to allow the recovery of $2.8 million in deferred costs, which it had originally disallowed in its September 2004 decision. This charge was originally recorded in fiscal 2004. This ruling decreased our depreciation expense during the year ended September 30, 2006. This decrease was offset by increased depreciation expense associated with the placement of various capital projects into service during the fiscal year. Operating expenses were also impacted by a $22.9 million noncash charge to impair our West Texas Division irrigation assets. During the fiscal 2006 fourth quarter, we determined that, as a result of declining irrigation sales primarily associated with our agricultural customers shift from gas-powered pumps to electric pumps, the West Texas Division irrigation assets would not be able to generate sufficient future cash flows from operations to recover the net investment in these assets. Therefore, the entire net book value was written off. We will continue to operate these assets until we determine a plan for these assets as we are obligated to provide natural gas services to certain customers served by these assets. We are currently evaluating an opportunity to sell these assets in the first quarter of fiscal 2008. We do not expect the outcome of this potential transaction to materially affect our results of operations. As a result of the aforementioned factors, our natural gas distribution segment operating income for the year ended September 30, 2006 decreased to $201.9 million from $236.4 million for the year ended September 30, 2005. Miscellaneous income Miscellaneous income for the year ended September 30, 2006 was $9.5 million compared to miscellaneous income of $6.8 million for the year ended September 30, 2005. This increase was primarily attributable to increased interest income on intercompany borrowings to our natural gas marketing segment to fund its working capital needs. This increase was partially offset by a $3.3 million charge recorded during the fiscal 2006 second quarter associated with an adverse ruling in Tennessee related to the calculation of a performance-based rate mechanism associated with gas purchases. Interest charges Interest charges allocated to the natural gas distribution segment for the year ended September 30, 2006 increased to $126.5 million from $112.4 million for the year ended September 30, 2005. The increase was attributable to higher average outstanding short-term debt balances to fund natural gas purchases at significantly higher prices coupled with an approximate 200 basis point increase in the interest rate on our $300 million unsecured floating rate Senior Notes due 2007 due to an increase in the three-month LIBOR rate. These increases were partially offset by $4.8 million of interest savings arising from the early payoff of $72.5 million of our First Mortgage Bonds in June 2005. 49 Table of Contents Regulated Transmission and Storage Segment Financial and operational highlights for our regulated transmission and storage segment for the years ended September 30, 2006 and 2005 are presented below. For the Year Ended September 30 2006 2005 (In thousands, unless otherwise noted) Mid-Tex transportation $ 69,925 $ 70,089 Third-party transportation 56,813 44,348 Storage and park and lend services 8,047 4,235 Other 6,348 19,362 Gross profit 141,133 138,034 Operating expenses 77,807 72,194 Operating income 63,326 65,840 Miscellaneous income (expense) (153 ) 150 Interest charges 22,787 23,344 Income before income taxes 40,386 42,646 Income tax expense 13,839 15,064 Net income $ 26,547 $ 27,582 Pipeline transportation volumes MMcf 410,505 373,879 Gross profit increased to $141.1 million for the year ended September 30, 2006 from $138.0 million for the year ended September 30, 2005. Total pipeline transportation volumes were 581.3 Bcf during the year ended September 30, 2006, compared with 554.5 Bcf for the prior year. Excluding intersegment transportation volumes, total pipeline transportation volumes were 410.5 Bcf during the current year compared with 373.9 Bcf in the prior year. The increase in gross profit was primarily attributable to increased third-party throughput and ancillary service margins. The increase in third-party transportation margins was primarily attributable to increases in the electric-generation market due to the warmer than normal temperatures during the summer of 2006, increased demand for through-system transportation services due to a widening of pricing differentials between the pipeline hubs and the impact of Atmos Pipeline Texas North Side Loop and other compression projects that were placed into service in June 2006. Storage and parking and lending services on Atmos Pipeline Texas also increased during fiscal 2006 as a result of the widening of pricing differentials between the pipeline hubs, which increased the attractiveness of storing gas on the pipeline and our ability to obtain improved margins for these services. The increases on Atmos Pipeline Texas system were partially offset by a decrease in margins earned from intercompany transportation services to our Mid-Tex Division due to the significantly warmer than normal weather experienced during fiscal 2006. Additionally, these increases were partially offset by the absence of inventory sales of $3.0 million realized in the prior year. Operating expenses increased to $77.8 million for the year ended September 30, 2006 from $72.2 million for the year ended September 30, 2005 due to higher employee benefit costs associated with an increase in headcount, increased pension and postretirement costs resulting from changes in the assumptions used to determine our fiscal 2006 costs, higher facilities costs and higher pipeline integrity costs. As a result of the aforementioned factors, our regulated transmission and storage segment operating income for the year ended September 30, 2006 decreased to $63.3 million from $65.8 million for the year ended September 30, 2005. 50 Table of Contents Natural Gas Marketing Segment Financial and operational highlights for our natural gas marketing segment for the years ended September 30, 2006 and 2005 are presented below. For the Year Ended September 30 2006 2005 (In thousands, unless otherwise noted) Delivered gas $ 87,236 $ 59,971 Asset optimization 26,225 28,008 Unrealized margins 17,166 (26,006 ) Gross profit 130,627 61,973 Operating expenses 28,392 20,988 Operating income 102,235 40,985 Miscellaneous income 2,598 771 Interest charges 8,510 3,405 Income before income taxes 96,323 38,351 Income tax expense 37,757 14,947 Net income $ 58,566 $ 23,404 Natural gas marketing sales volumes MMcf 283,962 238,097 Net physical position (Bcf) 14.5 6.9 The $68.7 million increase in our natural gas marketing segment gross profit reflects increased delivered gas margins and increased unrealized margins partially offset by a decrease in asset optimization margins. Delivered gas margins increased $27.3 million during fiscal 2006 as a result of increased sales volumes resulting from focusing our marketing efforts on higher margin opportunities partially offset by warmer-than-normal weather across our market areas. The increase in gas delivery margins also reflected our ability to successfully capture increased per unit margins in certain market areas that experienced higher market volatility. Asset optimization margins decreased $1.8 million primarily due to the realization of less favorable arbitrage spreads during the current year period compared with the prior year, coupled with increased storage fees. The favorable unrealized margin variance primarily was due to a favorable movement during the year ended September 30, 2006 in the forward natural gas prices associated with financial derivatives used in our gas delivery activities, a narrowing of the physical/forward spreads during fiscal 2006 and positive basis ineffectiveness on our financial derivatives. These results were magnified by a 7.6 Bcf increase in our net physical position at September 30, 2006 compared to the prior year. Operating expenses, which include operation and maintenance expense, provision for doubtful accounts, depreciation and amortization expense and taxes other than income taxes, increased to $28.4 million for the year ended September 30, 2006 from $21.0 million for the year ended September 30, 2005. The increase in operating expense primarily was attributable to an increase in personnel costs due to increased headcount and an increase in regulatory compliance costs. The improved gross profit margin partially offset by higher operating expenses resulted in an increase in our natural gas marketing segment operating income to $102.2 million for the year ended September 30, 2006 compared with operating income of $41.0 million for the year ended September 30, 2005. 51 Table of Contents Interest charges Interest charges allocated to the natural gas marketing segment for the year ended September 30, 2006 increased to $8.5 million from $3.4 million for the year ended September 30, 2005. The increase was attributable to higher average outstanding debt balances to fund natural gas purchases at significantly higher prices. Pipeline, Storage and Other Segment Financial and operational highlights for our pipeline, storage and other segment for the years ended September 30, 2006 and 2005 are presented below. For the Year Ended September 30 2006 2005 (In thousands, unless otherwise noted) Storage and transportation services $ 11,841 $ 11,539 Asset optimization 3,387 1,613 Other 5,916 5,324 Unrealized margins 3,350 (4,730 ) Gross profit 24,494 13,746 Operating expenses 9,570 8,482 Operating income 14,924 5,264 Miscellaneous income 6,858 4,455 Interest charges 6,512 3,457 Income before income taxes 15,270 6,262 Income tax expense 5,648 2,580 Net income $ 9,622 $ 3,682 Pipeline transportation volumes MMcf 5,439 5,580 Gross profit increased to $24.5 million for the year ended September 30, 2006 from $13.7 million for the year ended September 30, 2005. The increase in gross profit was primarily attributable to increased unrealized gains recorded during fiscal 2006 as favorable movements in the forward natural gas prices used to value the financial hedges designated against the physical inventory underlying these contracts resulted in an unrealized gain compared with an unrealized loss in the prior year. Additionally, APS recorded increased margins from its asset optimization activities due to its ability to capture more favorable arbitrage spreads. Operating expenses increased to $9.6 million for the year ended September 30, 2006 from $8.5 million for the year ended September 30, 2005 due to higher employee and other administrative costs. As a result of the aforementioned factors, our pipeline, storage and other segment operating income for the year ended September 30, 2006 increased to $14.9 million from $5.3 million for the year ended September 30, 2005. LIQUIDITY AND CAPITAL RESOURCES Our internally generated funds and borrowings under our credit facilities and commercial paper program generally provide the liquidity needed to fund our working capital, capital expenditures and other cash needs. Additionally, from time to time, we raise funds from the public debt and equity capital markets through our existing shelf registration statement to fund our liquidity needs. 52 Table of Contents Cash Flows Our internally generated funds may change in the future due to a number of factors, some of which we cannot control. These include regulatory changes, the price for our services, the demand for our services, margin requirements resulting from significant changes in commodity prices, operational risks and other factors. Cash flows from operating activities Year-over-year changes in our operating cash flows are primarily attributable to working capital changes within our natural gas distribution segment resulting from the impact of the price of natural gas and the timing of customer collections, payments for natural gas purchases, deferred gas cost recoveries and weather. For the year ended September 30, 2007, we generated operating cash flow of $547.1 million compared with $311.4 million in fiscal 2006 and $386.9 million in fiscal 2005. The significant factors impacting our operating cash flow for the last three fiscal years are summarized below. Year ended September 30, 2007 Fiscal 2007 operating cash flows reflect the favorable timing of payments for accounts payable and accrued liabilities, which increased operating cash flow by $107.6 million. Additionally, improved management of our deferred gas cost balances increased operating cash flow by $125.2 million. Finally, increased net income and other favorable working capital changes contributed to the increase in operating cash flow. Partially offsetting these increases in operating cash flow was a decrease in customer collections of $84.8 million due to the decrease in the price of natural gas during the current year. Year ended September 30, 2006 Fiscal 2006 operating cash flows reflect the adverse impact of significantly higher natural gas prices. Year-over-year, unfavorable timing of payments for accounts payable and other accrued liabilities reduced operating cash flow by $523.0 million. Partially offsetting these outflows were higher customer collections ($245.1 million) and reduced payments for natural gas inventories ($102.1 million). Additionally, favorable movements in the market indices used to value our natural gas marketing segment risk management assets and liabilities reduced the amount that we were required to deposit in a margin account and therefore favorably affected operating cash flow by $126.3 million. Year ended September 30, 2005 Fiscal 2005 operating cash flows reflect the effects of a $49.6 million increase in net income and effective working capital management partially offset by higher natural gas prices. Working capital management efforts, which affected the timing of payments for accounts payable and other accrued liabilities, favorably affected operating cash flow by $354.1 million. However, these efforts were partially offset by reduced cash flow generated from accounts receivable changes by $168.9 million, primarily attributable to higher natural gas prices, and an increase in our natural gas inventories attributable to a 13 percent year-over-year increase in natural gas prices coupled with increased natural gas inventory levels, which reduced operating cash flow by $81.8 million. Operating cash flow was also adversely impacted by unfavorable movements in the indices used to value our natural gas marketing segment risk management assets and liabilities, which resulted in a net liability for the segment. Accordingly, under the terms of the associated derivative contracts, we were required to deposit $81.0 million into a margin account. Cash flows from investing activities In recent years, a substantial portion of our cash resources has been used to fund acquisitions and growth projects, our ongoing construction program and improvements to information systems. Our ongoing construction program enables us to provide natural gas distribution services to our existing customer base, expand our natural gas distribution services into new markets, enhance the integrity of our pipelines and, more recently, expand our intrastate pipeline network. In executing our current rate strategy, we are directing discretionary 53 Table of Contents capital spending to jurisdictions that permit us to earn a return on our investment timely. Currently, our Mid-Tex, Louisiana, Mississippi and West Texas natural gas distribution divisions and our Atmos Pipeline Texas Division have rate designs that provide the opportunity to include in their rate base approved capital costs on a periodic basis without being required to file a rate case. For the year ended September 30, 2007, we incurred $392.4 million for capital expenditures compared with $425.3 million for the year ended September 30, 2006 and $333.2 million for the year ended September 30, 2005. The decrease in capital expenditures in fiscal 2007 primarily reflects the absence of capital expenditures associated with our North Side Loop and other pipeline compression projects, which were completed during the fiscal 2006 third quarter. Our cash used for investing activities for the year ended September 30, 2005 reflects the $1.9 billion cash paid for the TXU Gas acquisition, including related transaction costs and expenses. Cash flows from financing activities For the year ended September 30, 2007, our financing activities used $159.3 million in cash compared with $155.3 million and $1.7 billion provided for the years ended September 30, 2006 and 2005. Our significant financing activities for the years ended September 30, 2007, 2006 and 2005 are summarized as follows: In December 2006, we raised net proceeds of approximately $192 million from the sale of approximately 6.3 million shares of common stock, including the underwriters exercise of their overallotment option of 0.8 million shares, under a shelf registration statement filed with the SEC in December 2006. The net proceeds from this issuance were used to reduce our then-existing short-term debt balance. In June 2007, we issued $250 million of 6.35% Senior Notes due 2017. The effective interest rate of this offering, inclusive of all debt issue costs, was 6.45 percent. After giving effect to the settlement of our $100 million Treasury lock agreement in June 2007, the effective rate on these senior notes was reduced to 6.26 percent. We used the net proceeds of $247 million, together with $53 million of available cash, to repay our $300 million unsecured floating rate senior notes, which were redeemed on July 15, 2007. During the years ended September 30, 2006 and 2005, we increased our borrowings under our short-term facilities by $237.6 million and $144.8 million whereas during the year ended September 30, 2007, we repaid a net $213.2 million under our short-term facilities. Net borrowings under our short-term facilities during fiscal 2006 and 2005 reflect the impact of seasonal natural gas purchases and the effect of higher natural gas prices. We repaid $303.2 million of long-term debt during the year ended September 30, 2007, compared with $3.3 million during the year ended September 30, 2006 and $103.4 million during the year ended September 30, 2005. Fiscal 2005 payments reflected the repayment of $72.5 million of our First Mortgage Bonds. In connection with this repayment we paid a $25.0 million make-whole premium in accordance with the terms of the agreements and accrued interest of approximately $1.0 million. During the year ended September 30, 2007, we paid $111.7 million in cash dividends compared with dividend payments of $102.3 million and $99.0 million for the years ended September 30, 2006 and 2005. The increase in dividends paid over the prior-year period reflects the increase in our dividend rate from $1.26 per share during fiscal 2006 to $1.28 per share during fiscal 2007, combined with a 7.6 million increase in shares outstanding due to share issuances in connection with our December 2006 equity offering and new share issuances under our various plans. In October 2004, we sold a total of 16.1 million shares of common stock, including the underwriters exercise of their overallotment option, generating net proceeds of approximately $382 million. Additionally, we issued $1.39 billion of senior unsecured debt. The net proceeds from these issuances, combined with the net proceeds of $235.7 million from a July 2004 common stock offering were used to finance the acquisition of our Mid-Tex and Atmos Pipeline Texas divisions and settle Treasury lock agreements, into which we entered to fix the Treasury yield component of the interest cost of financing associated with $875 million of the $1.39 billion long-term debt we issued. 54 Table of Contents In addition to the December 2006 equity offering described above, during the year ended September 30, 2007 we issued 0.9 million shares of common stock which generated net proceeds of $24.9 million. In addition, we granted 0.4 million shares of common stock under our 1998 Long-Term Incentive Plan to directors, officers and other participants in the plan. The following table shows the number of shares issued for the years ended September 30, 2007, 2006 and 2005: For the Year Ended September 30 2007 2006 2005 Shares issued: Direct stock purchase plan 325,338 387,833 450,212 Retirement savings plan 422,646 442,635 441,350 1998 Long-term incentive plan 511,584 366,905 745,788 Long-term stock plan for Mid-States Division 300 Outside directors stock-for-fee plan 2,453 2,442 2,341 December 2006 Offering 6,325,000 October 2004 Offering 16,100,000 Total shares issued 7,587,021 1,200,115 17,739,691 Credit Facilities As of September 30, 2007, we had a total of approximately $1.5 billion of credit facilities, comprised of three short-term committed credit facilities totaling $918 million, one uncommitted credit facility totaling $25 million and, through AEM, a second uncommitted credit facility that can provide up to $580 million. Borrowings under our uncommitted credit facilities are made on a when-and-as-needed basis at the discretion of the banks. Our credit capacity and the amount of unused borrowing capacity are affected by the seasonal nature of the natural gas business and our short-term borrowing requirements, which are typically highest during colder winter months. Our working capital needs can vary significantly due to changes in the price of natural gas charged by suppliers and the increased gas supplies required to meet customers needs during periods of cold weather. As of September 30, 2007, the amount available to us under our credit facilities, net of outstanding letters of credit, was $908.8 million. We believe these credit facilities, combined with our operating cash flows will be sufficient to fund our working capital needs. These facilities are described in further detail in Note 6 to the consolidated financial statements. Shelf Registration On December 4, 2006, we filed a registration statement with the SEC to issue, from time to time, up to $900 million in common stock and/or debt securities available for issuance, including approximately $401.5 million of capacity carried over from our prior shelf registration statement filed with the SEC in August 2004. In December 2006, we sold approximately 6.3 million shares of common stock in an equity offering under the registration statement and used the net proceeds to reduce short-term debt. In June 2007, we issued $250 million of 6.35% Senior Notes due 2017 in a debt offering under the registration statement. The net proceeds of approximately $247 million, together with $53 million of available cash, were used to repay our $300 million unsecured floating rate senior notes in July 2007. After these issuances, we have approximately $450 million of availability remaining under the registration statement. However, due to certain restrictions imposed by one state regulatory commission on our ability to issue securities under the registration statement, we now have remaining and available for issuance a total of approximately $100 million of equity securities, $50 million of senior debt securities and $300 million of subordinated debt securities. In addition, due to restrictions imposed by another state regulatory commission, if the credit ratings on our senior unsecured debt were to fall below investment grade from either Standard & 55 Table of Contents Poor Corporation (BBB-), Moody Investors Services, Inc. (Baa3) or Fitch Ratings, Ltd. (BBB-), our ability to issue any type of debt securities under the registration statement would be suspended until an investment grade rating from all three credit rating agencies was achieved. Credit Ratings Our credit ratings directly affect our ability to obtain short-term and long-term financing, in addition to the cost of such financing. In determining our credit ratings, the rating agencies consider a number of quantitative factors, including debt to total capitalization, operating cash flow relative to outstanding debt, operating cash flow coverage of interest and pension liabilities and funding status. In addition, the rating agencies consider qualitative factors such as consistency of our earnings over time, the quality of our management and business strategy, the risks associated with our regulated and nonregulated businesses and the regulatory structures that govern our rates in the states where we operate. Our debt is rated by three rating agencies: Standard & Poor Corporation (S&P), Moody Investors Services, Inc. (Moody s) and Fitch Ratings, Ltd. (Fitch). Our current debt ratings are all considered investment grade and are as follows: S&P Moody Fitch Unsecured senior long-term debt BBB Baa3 BBB+ Commercial paper A-2 P-3 F-2 Currently, with respect to our unsecured senior long-term debt, Moody and Fitch maintain their stable outlook and S&P maintains its positive outlook. None of our ratings is currently under review. A credit rating is not a recommendation to buy, sell or hold securities. The highest investment grade credit rating for S&P is AAA, Moody is Aaa and Fitch is AAA. The lowest investment grade credit rating for S&P is BBB-, Moody is Baa3 and Fitch is BBB-. Our credit ratings may be revised or withdrawn at any time by the rating agencies, and each rating should be evaluated independent of any other rating. There can be no assurance that a rating will remain in effect for any given period of time or that a rating will not be lowered, or withdrawn entirely, by a rating agency if, in its judgment, circumstances so warrant. Debt Covenants We were in compliance with all of our debt covenants as of September 30, 2007. Our debt covenants are described in Note 6 to the consolidated financial statements. Capitalization The following table presents our capitalization as of September 30, 2007 and 2006: September 30 2007 2006 (In thousands, except percentages) Short-term debt $ 150,599 3.5 % $ 382,416 9.1 % Long-term debt 2,130,146 50.2 % 2,183,548 51.8 % Shareholders equity 1,965,754 46.3 % 1,648,098 39.1 % Total capitalization, including short-term debt $ 4,246,499 100.0 % $ 4,214,062 100.0 % Total debt as a percentage of total capitalization, including short-term debt, was 53.7 percent and 60.9 percent at September 30, 2007 and 2006. The decrease in the debt to capitalization ratio primarily reflects the favorable impact of our December 2006 equity offering and the reduction in short-term and long-term debt as of September 30, 2007. Our ratio of total debt to capitalization is typically greater during the winter heating season as we make additional short-term borrowings to fund natural gas purchases and meet our working capital requirements. We intend to maintain our capitalization ratio in a target range of 50 to 55 percent 56 Table of Contents through cash flow generated from operations, continued issuance of new common stock under our Direct Stock Purchase Plan and Retirement Savings Plan and access to the equity capital markets. Contractual Obligations and Commercial Commitments The following table provides information about contractual obligations and commercial commitments at September 30, 2007. Payments Due by Period Less Than More Than Total 1 Year 1-3 Years 3-5 Years 5 Years (In thousands) Contractual Obligations Long-term debt (1) $ 2,133,693 $ 3,831 $ 403,416 $ 365,065 $ 1,361,381 Short-term debt (1) 150,599 150,599 Interest charges (2) 1,060,034 119,628 223,250 169,198 547,958 Gas purchase commitments (3) 729,380 430,416 266,951 19,092 12,921 Capital lease obligations (4) 2,344 362 602 372 1,008 Operating leases (4) 171,405 16,923 30,957 28,247 95,278 Demand fees for contracted storage (5) 20,811 13,823 6,642 346 Demand fees for contracted transportation (6) 27,705 4,265 7,009 6,968 9,463 Derivative obligations (7) 21,629 21,339 290 Postretirement benefit plan contributions (8) 145,562 12,006 20,195 25,531 87,830 Total contractual obligations $ 4,463,162 $ 773,192 $ 959,312 $ 614,819 $ 2,115,839 (1) See Note 6 to the consolidated financial statements. (2) Interest charges were calculated using the stated rate for each debt issuance. (3) Gas purchase commitments were determined based upon contractually determined volumes at prices estimated based upon the index specified in the contract, adjusted for estimated basis differentials and contractual discounts as of September 30, 2007. (4) See Note 14 to the consolidated financial statements. (5) Represents third party contractual demand fees for contracted storage in our natural gas marketing and pipeline, storage and other segments. Contractual demand fees for contracted storage for our natural gas distribution segment are excluded as these costs are fully recoverable through our purchase gas adjustment mechanisms. (6) Represents third party contractual demand fees for transportation in our natural gas marketing segment. (7) Represents liabilities for natural gas commodity derivative contracts that were valued as of September 30, 2007. The ultimate settlement amounts of these remaining liabilities are unknown because they are subject to continuing market risk until the derivative contracts are settled. (8) Represents expected contributions to our postretirement benefit plans. AEM has commitments to purchase physical quantities of natural gas under contracts indexed to the forward NYMEX strip or fixed price contracts. At September 30, 2007, AEM was committed to purchase 80.4 Bcf within one year, 38.1 Bcf within one to three years and 1.4 Bcf after three years under indexed contracts. AEM was committed to purchase 2.4 Bcf within one year and 0.1 Bcf within one to three years under fixed price contracts with prices ranging from $5.69 to $9.85 per Mcf. With the exception of our Mid-Tex Division, our natural gas distribution segment maintains supply contracts with several vendors that generally cover a period of up to one year. Commitments for estimated base gas volumes are established under these contracts on a monthly basis at contractually negotiated prices. Commitments for incremental daily purchases are made as necessary during the month in accordance with the 57 Table of Contents terms of the individual contract. Our Mid-Tex Division maintains long-term supply contracts to ensure a reliable source of gas for our customers in its service area which obligate it to purchase specified volumes at market prices. The estimated commitments under these contract terms as of September 30, 2007 are reflected in the table above. Risk Management Activities We conduct risk management activities through our natural gas distribution, natural gas marketing and pipeline, storage and other segments. In our natural gas distribution segment, we use a combination of physical storage, fixed physical contracts and fixed financial contracts to reduce our exposure to unusually large winter-period gas price increases. In our natural gas marketing and pipeline, storage and other segments, we manage our exposure to the risk of natural gas price changes and lock in our gross profit margin through a combination of storage and financial derivatives, including futures, over-the-counter and exchange-traded options and swap contracts with counterparties. To the extent our inventory cost and actual sales and actual purchases do not correlate with the changes in the market indices we use in our hedges, we could experience ineffectiveness or the hedges may no longer meet the accounting requirements for hedge accounting, resulting in the derivatives being treated as mark to market instruments through earnings. We record our derivatives as a component of risk management assets and liabilities, which are classified as current or noncurrent based upon the anticipated settlement date of the underlying derivative. Substantially all of our derivative financial instruments are valued using external market quotes and indices. The following table shows the components of the change in fair value of our natural gas distribution and natural gas marketing derivative contract activities for the year ended September 30, 2007 (in thousands): Natural Gas Natural Gas Distribution Marketing Fair value of contracts at September 30, 2006 $ (27,209 ) $ 15,003 Contracts realized/settled (27,824 ) (9,215 ) Fair value of new contracts (8,883 ) Other changes in value 42,863 21,020 Fair value of contracts at September 30, 2007 $ (21,053 ) $ 26,808 The fair value of our natural gas distribution and natural gas marketing derivative contracts at September 30, 2007, is segregated below by time period and fair value source. Fair Value of Contracts at September 30, 2007 Maturity in Years Less Greater Total Fair Source of Fair Value Than 1 1-3 4-5 Than 5 Value (In thousands) Prices actively quoted $ 1,304 $ 6,072 $ $ $ 7,376 Prices based on models and other valuation methods (794 ) (827 ) (1,621 ) Total Fair Value $ 510 $ 5,245 $ $ $ 5,755 Pension and Postretirement Benefits Obligations Net Periodic Pension and Postretirement Benefit Costs For the fiscal year ended September 30, 2007, our total net periodic pension and other benefits costs was $48.6 million, compared with $50.0 million and $36.4 million for the years ended September 30, 2006 and 2005. These costs relating to our natural gas distribution operations are recoverable through our gas distribution rates; however, a portion of these costs is capitalized into our gas distribution rate base. The remaining costs are recorded as a component of operation and maintenance expense. 58 Table of Contents The decrease in total net periodic pension and other benefits cost during fiscal 2007 compared with fiscal 2006 primarily reflects changes in assumptions we made during our annual pension plan valuation completed June 30, 2006. The discount rate used to compute the present value of a plan liabilities generally is based on rates of high-grade corporate bonds with maturities similar to the average period over which the benefits will be paid. In the period leading up to our June 30, 2006 measurement date, these interest rates were increasing, which resulted in a 130 basis point increase in our discount rate used to determine our fiscal 2007 net periodic and post-retirement cost to 6.30 percent. This increase had the effect of decreasing the present value of our plan liabilities and associated expenses. This favorable impact was partially offset by the unfavorable impact of reducing the expected return on our pension plan assets by 25 basis points to 8.25 percent, which has the effect of increasing our pension and postretirement benefit cost. The increase in total net periodic pension and other benefits cost during fiscal 2006 compared with the prior year primarily reflects changes in assumptions we made during our annual pension plan valuation completed June 30, 2005. The discount rate used to compute the present value of a plan liabilities generally is based on rates of high-grade corporate bonds with maturities similar to the average period over which the benefits will be paid. In the period leading up to our June 30, 2005 measurement date, these interest rates were declining, which resulted in a 125 basis point reduction in our discount rate to 5.0 percent. This reduction increased the present value of our plan liabilities and associated expenses. Additionally, we reduced the expected return on our pension plan assets by 25 basis points to 8.5 percent, which also increased our pension and postretirement benefit cost. Pension and Postretirement Plan Funding Generally, our funding policy is to contribute annually an amount in accordance with the requirements of the Employee Retirement Income Security Act of 1974. However, additional voluntary contributions are made from time to time as considered necessary. Contributions are intended to provide not only for benefits attributed to service to date but also for those expected to be earned in the future. During fiscal 2007, we did not contribute to our pension plans. During fiscal 2006, we voluntarily contributed $2.9 million to the Atmos Energy Corporation Retirement Plan for Mississippi Valley Gas Union Employees. That contribution achieved a desired level of funding by satisfying the minimum funding requirements while maximizing the tax deductible contribution for this plan for plan year 2005. During fiscal 2005, we voluntarily contributed $3.0 million to the Master Trust to maintain the level of funding we desire relative to our accumulated benefit obligation. We made the contribution because declining high yield corporate bond yields in the period leading up to our June 30, 2005 measurement date resulted in an increase in the present value of our plan liabilities. We contributed $11.8 million, $10.9 million and $10.0 million to our postretirement benefits plans for the years ended September 30, 2007, 2006 and 2005. The contributions represent the portion of the postretirement costs we are responsible for under the terms of our plan and minimum funding required by state regulatory commissions. Outlook for Fiscal 2008 Market conditions as of the June 30, 2007 valuation date were similar to market conditions as of our June 30, 2006 measurement date, Therefore, we maintained the discount rate for determining our fiscal 2008 pension and benefit costs at 6.3 percent and the expected return on our pension plan assets at 8.25 percent. Accordingly, we expect our fiscal 2008 pension and postretirement medical costs to be materially the same as fiscal 2007. We are not required to make a minimum funding contribution to our pension plans during fiscal 2008; nor, at this time, do we intend to make voluntary contributions during 2008. However, we anticipate contributing approximately $12 million to our postretirement medical plans during fiscal 2008. The projected pension liability, future funding requirements and the amount of pension expense or income recognized for the Plan are subject to change, depending upon the actuarial value of plan assets and the 59 Table of Contents determination of future benefit obligations as of each subsequent actuarial calculation date. These amounts are impacted by actual investment returns, changes in interest rates and changes in the demographic composition of the participants in the plan. RECENT ACCOUNTING DEVELOPMENTS Recent accounting developments and their impact on our financial position, results of operations and cash flows are described in Note 2 to the consolidated financial statements.
