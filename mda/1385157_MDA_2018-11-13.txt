ITEM 7. MANAGEMENT'S DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS OF FINANCIAL CONDITION AND RESULTS OF OPERATIONS The following discussion and analysis of our financial condition and results of operations should be read in conjunction with our Consolidated Financial Statements and the accompanying notes included elsewhere in this Annual Report. The following discussion may contain forward-looking statements that reflect our plans, estimates, and beliefs. Our actual results could differ materially from those discussed in these forward-looking statements. Factors that could cause or contribute to these differences include those factors discussed below and elsewhere in this Annual Report, particularly in "Risk Factors" and "Forward-Looking Information." Our Consolidated Financial Statements have been prepared in U.S. dollars, in accordance with accounting principles generally accepted in the U.S. ("GAAP"). The following discussion includes organic net sales growth which is a non-GAAP financial measure. See "Non-GAAP Financial Measure" for additional information regarding this measure. Overview We are a global technology and manufacturing leader creating a safer, sustainable, productive, and connected future. For more than 75 years, our connectivity and sensor solutions, proven in the harshest environments, have enabled advancements in transportation, industrial applications, medical technology, energy, data communications, and the home. Fiscal 2018 highlights included the following: Our fiscal 2018 net sales increased 14.8% over fiscal 2017 levels due to growth in all segments. On an organic basis, our net sales increased 9.2% in fiscal 2018 as compared to fiscal 2017. Our net sales by segment were as follows: Transportation Solutions Our net sales increased 17.8% as a result of increased sales in all end markets. Also, our net sales in the automotive end market benefited from sales contributions from a recent acquisition. Industrial Solutions Our net sales increased 10.0% due to increased sales in the industrial equipment end market and, to a lesser degree, the aerospace, defense, oil, and gas and the energy end markets. Communications Solutions Our net sales increased 12.4% due to sales increases in the appliances and the data and devices end markets. During fiscal 2018, our shareholders approved a dividend payment to shareholders of $1.76 per share, payable in four equal quarterly installments of $0.44 beginning in the third quarter of fiscal 2018 and ending in the second quarter of fiscal 2019. Net cash provided by continuing operating activities was $2,301 million in fiscal 2018. Outlook In the first quarter of fiscal 2019, we expect our net sales to be between $3.33 billion and $3.43 billion as compared to $3.34 billion in the first quarter of fiscal 2018, with sales increases in the Industrial Solutions and Communications Solutions segments. Additional information regarding expectations for our reportable segments for the first quarter of fiscal 2019 as compared to the same period of fiscal 2018 is as follows: Transportation Solutions We expect our net sales increase in the sensors end market to be offset by sales declines in the automotive end market. Our net sales in the automotive end market are 24 Table of Contents expected to benefit from content gains; however, this growth will be more than offset by the negative impact of foreign currency exchange rates. We expect global automotive production to decline approximately 2% in the first quarter of fiscal 2019. Industrial Solutions We expect our net sales growth to be driven primarily by increased sales in the aerospace, defense, oil, and gas and the industrial equipment end markets. Communications Solutions We expect net sales growth primarily as a result of increased sales in the data and devices end market. In the first quarter of fiscal 2019, we expect diluted earnings per share from continuing operations to be in the range of $1.09 to $1.13 per share. This outlook reflects the negative impact of foreign currency exchange rates on net sales and earnings per share of approximately $75 million and $0.04 per share, respectively, in the first quarter of fiscal 2019 as compared to the same period of fiscal 2018. We expect our net sales to be between $13.9 billion and $14.3 billion in fiscal 2019 as compared to $14.0 billion in fiscal 2018, with moderate growth in all segments. Additional information regarding expectations for our reportable segments for fiscal 2019 as compared to fiscal 2018 is as follows: Transportation Solutions We expect our net sales increases in the sensors end market to be largely offset by sales declines in the commercial transportation end market. Fiscal 2019 global automotive production is expected to be consistent with fiscal 2018 levels. Industrial Solutions We expect our net sales to increase in the industrial equipment end market due primarily to continued growth in medical applications and a recent acquisition. Communications Solutions We expect net sales growth due primarily to sales increases in the data and devices end market. We expect diluted earnings per share from continuing operations to be in the range of $5.20 to $5.40 per share in fiscal 2019. This outlook reflects the negative impact of foreign currency exchange rates on net sales and earnings per share of approximately $400 million and $0.16 per share, respectively, in fiscal 2019 as compared to fiscal 2018. The above outlook is based on foreign currency exchange rates and commodity prices that are consistent with current levels. We are monitoring the current macroeconomic environment and its potential effects on our customers and the end markets we serve. We continue to closely manage our costs in line with economic conditions. Additionally, we are managing our capital resources and monitoring capital availability to ensure that we have sufficient resources to fund future capital needs. See further discussion in "Liquidity and Capital Resources." Acquisitions During fiscal 2018, we acquired two businesses for a combined cash purchase price of $153 million, net of cash acquired. The acquisitions were reported as part of our Industrial Solutions segment from the date of acquisition. We acquired two businesses during fiscal 2017 for a combined cash purchase price of $250 million, net of cash acquired. The acquisitions were reported as part of our Transportation Solutions and Industrial Solutions segments from the date of acquisition. In fiscal 2016, we acquired four businesses, including the Creganna Medical group ("Creganna"), for a combined cash purchase price of $1.3 billion, net of cash acquired. The acquisitions were reported as part of our Industrial Solutions and Transportation Solutions segments from the date of acquisition. 25 Table of Contents See Note 5 to the Consolidated Financial Statements for additional information regarding acquisitions. Discontinued Operations On September 16, 2018, we entered into a definitive agreement to sell our Subsea Communications ("SubCom") business for $325 million, subject to a final working capital adjustment. The SubCom business met the held for sale and discontinued operations criteria and has been reported as such in all periods presented on the Consolidated Financial Statements. Prior to reclassification to discontinued operations, the SubCom business was included in the Communications Solutions segment. See Notes 4 and 23 to the Consolidated Financial Statements for additional information regarding discontinued operations. Divestiture During fiscal 2016, we sold our Circuit Protection Devices ("CPD") business for net cash proceeds of $333 million. We recognized a pre-tax gain of $144 million on the transaction. The CPD business was reported as part of the Data and Devices business within our Communications Solutions segment. Results of Operations Net Sales The following table presents our net sales and the percentage of total net sales by segment: Fiscal 2018 2017 2016 ($ in millions) Transportation Solutions $ 8,290 59 % $ 7,039 58 % $ 6,503 58 % Industrial Solutions 3,856 28 3,507 29 3,215 28 Communications Solutions 1,842 13 1,639 13 1,634 14 Total $ 13,988 100 % $ 12,185 100 % $ 11,352 100 % The following table provides an analysis of the change in our net sales compared to the prior fiscal year by segment: Fiscal 2018 2017 Change in Net Sales versus Prior Fiscal Year Change in Net Sales versus Prior Fiscal Year Net Sales Growth Organic Net Sales Growth Translation Acquisitions Net Sales Growth Organic Net Sales Growth Translation Acquisitions (Divestiture) ($ in millions) Transportation Solutions $ 1,251 17.8 % $ 739 10.5 % $ 295 $ 217 $ 536 8.2 % $ 553 8.5 % $ (47 ) $ 30 Industrial Solutions 349 10.0 207 5.9 110 32 292 9.1 50 1.6 (20 ) 262 Communications Solutions 203 12.4 172 10.5 31 5 0.3 91 5.7 (16 ) (70 ) Total $ 1,803 14.8 % $ 1,118 9.2 % $ 436 $ 249 $ 833 7.3 % $ 694 6.1 % $ (83 ) $ 222 Net sales increased $1,803 million, or 14.8%, in fiscal 2018 as compared to fiscal 2017. The increase in net sales resulted from organic net sales growth of 9.2%, the positive impact of foreign currency translation of 3.6% due to the strengthening of certain foreign currencies, and sales contributions from acquisitions of 2.0%. Organic net sales were adversely affected by price erosion of $180 million in fiscal 2018. 26 Table of Contents Net sales increased $833 million, or 7.3%, in fiscal 2017 as compared to fiscal 2016. The increase in net sales resulted from organic net sales growth of 6.1% and net sales contributions from acquisitions and a divestiture of 1.9%, partially offset by the negative impact of foreign currency translation of 0.7% due to the weakening of certain foreign currencies. Organic net sales were adversely affected by price erosion of $218 million in fiscal 2017. Fiscal 2016 included an additional week which contributed $227 million in net sales. The impact of the additional week was estimated using an average weekly sales figure for the last month of the fiscal year. See further discussion of net sales below under "Segment Results." Net Sales by Geographic Region. Our business operates in three geographic regions EMEA, Asia Pacific, and the Americas and our results of operations are influenced by changes in foreign currency exchange rates. Increases or decreases in the value of the U.S. dollar, compared to other currencies, will directly affect our reported results as we translate those currencies into U.S. dollars at the end of each fiscal period. We sell our products into approximately 140 countries, and approximately 60% of our net sales were invoiced in currencies other than the U.S. dollar in fiscal 2018. The percentage of net sales in fiscal 2018 by major currencies invoiced was as follows: Currencies Percentage U.S. dollar 40 % Euro 32 Chinese renminbi 14 Japanese yen 6 All others 8 Total 100 % The following table presents our net sales and the percentage of total net sales by geographic region: Fiscal 2018 2017 2016 ($ in millions) EMEA $ 5,255 38 % $ 4,399 36 % $ 4,114 36 % Asia Pacific 4,762 34 4,312 35 3,923 35 Americas 3,971 28 3,474 29 3,315 29 Total $ 13,988 100 % $ 12,185 100 % $ 11,352 100 % The following table provides an analysis of the change in our net sales compared to the prior fiscal year by geographic region: Fiscal 2018 2017 Change in Net Sales versus Prior Fiscal Year Change in Net Sales versus Prior Fiscal Year Net Sales Growth Organic Net Sales Growth Translation Acquisitions Net Sales Growth Organic Net Sales Growth Translation Acquisitions (Divestiture) ($ in millions) EMEA $ 856 19.5 % $ 330 7.5 % $ 332 $ 194 $ 285 6.9 % $ 140 3.4 % $ (24 ) $ 169 Asia Pacific 450 10.4 318 7.4 117 15 389 9.9 498 12.7 (66 ) (43 ) Americas 497 14.3 470 13.6 (13 ) 40 159 4.8 56 1.7 7 96 Total $ 1,803 14.8 % $ 1,118 9.2 % $ 436 $ 249 $ 833 7.3 % $ 694 6.1 % $ (83 ) $ 222 27 Table of Contents Cost of Sales and Gross Margin The following table presents cost of sales and gross margin information: Fiscal Fiscal 2018 versus 2017 Fiscal 2017 versus 2016 2018 2017 2016 ($ in millions) Cost of sales $ 9,243 $ 8,002 $ 7,525 $ 1,241 $ 477 As a percentage of net sales 66.1 % 65.7 % 66.3 % Gross margin $ 4,745 $ 4,183 $ 3,827 (1) $ 562 $ 356 As a percentage of net sales 33.9 % 34.3 % 33.7 % (1) Fiscal 2016 included an additional week which contributed $86 million in gross margin. In fiscal 2018, gross margin increased $562 million as compared to fiscal 2017, primarily as a result of higher volume and the positive impact of foreign currency translation, partially offset by price erosion. Gross margin as a percentage of net sales decreased to 33.9% in fiscal 2018 from 34.3% in fiscal 2017. Gross margin increased $356 million in fiscal 2017 as compared to fiscal 2016 due primarily to higher volume and lower material costs, partially offset by price erosion. Gross margin as a percentage of net sales increased to 34.3% in fiscal 2017 from 33.7% in fiscal 2016. Cost of sales and gross margin are subject to variability in raw material prices which continue to fluctuate for many of the raw materials used in the manufacture of our products. In fiscal 2018, we purchased approximately 195 million pounds of copper, 139,000 troy ounces of gold, and 2.8 million troy ounces of silver. The following table presents the average prices incurred related to copper, gold, and silver.

Operating Expenses The following table presents operating expense information: Fiscal Fiscal 2018 versus 2017 Fiscal 2017 versus 2016 2018 2017 2016 ($ in millions) Selling, general, and administrative expenses $ 1,594 $ 1,543 $ 1,396 $ 51 $ 147 As a percentage of net sales 11.4 % 12.7 % 12.3 % Research, development, and engineering expenses $ 680 $ 611 $ 603 $ 69 $ 8 Restructuring and other charges (credits), net 126 147 (2 ) (21 ) 149 Selling, General, and Administrative Expenses. In fiscal 2018, selling, general, and administrative expenses increased $51 million as compared to fiscal 2017 due primarily to increased selling expenses to support higher sales levels and incremental expenses attributable to recently acquired businesses, 28 Table of Contents partially offset by lower incentive compensation costs and a gain on the sale of certain assets. Selling, general, and administrative expenses increased $147 million in fiscal 2017 as compared to fiscal 2016 primarily as a result of increased incentive compensation costs, increased selling expenses to support higher sales levels, and increased costs associated with long-term expense reduction initiatives. Research, Development, and Engineering Expenses. In fiscal 2018, research, development, and engineering expenses increased $69 million as compared to fiscal 2017 due to costs related to growth initiatives, primarily in the Transportation Solutions segment. Restructuring and Other Charges (Credits), Net. We are committed to continuous productivity improvements, and we evaluate opportunities to simplify our global manufacturing footprint, migrate facilities to lower-cost regions, reduce fixed costs, and eliminate excess capacity. These initiatives are designed to help us maintain our competitiveness in the industry, improve our operating leverage, and position us for future growth. During fiscal 2018, we initiated a restructuring program associated with footprint consolidation and structural improvements primarily impacting the Industrial Solutions and Transportation Solutions segments. During fiscal 2017, we initiated a restructuring program associated with footprint consolidation related to recent acquisitions and structural improvements impacting all segments. During fiscal 2016, we initiated a restructuring program associated with headcount reductions impacting all segments and product line closures in the Communications Solutions segment. In connection with these initiatives, we recorded net restructuring charges of $140 million, $146 million, and $121 million in fiscal 2018, 2017, and 2016, respectively. Annualized cost savings related to actions initiated in fiscal 2018 are expected to be approximately $125 million and are expected to be realized by the end of fiscal 2020. Cost savings will be reflected primarily in cost of sales and selling, general, and administrative expenses. During fiscal 2019, we expect net restructuring charges to be similar to fiscal 2018 levels and we expect total spending, which will be funded with cash from operations, to be approximately $140 million. During fiscal 2016, we recognized a pre-tax gain of $144 million on the sale of our CPD business. See Note 3 to the Consolidated Financial Statements for additional information regarding net restructuring and other charges (credits). Operating Income The following table presents operating income and operating margin information: Fiscal Fiscal 2018 versus 2017 Fiscal 2017 versus 2016 2018 2017 2016 ($ in millions) Operating income $ 2,331 $ 1,876 $ 1,808 (1) $ 455 $ 68 Operating margin 16.7 % 15.4 % 15.9 % (1) Fiscal 2016 included an additional week which contributed $53 million in operating income. 29 Table of Contents Operating income included the following: Fiscal 2018 2017 2016 (in millions) Acquisition related charges: Acquisition and integration costs $ 14 $ 6 $ 22 Charges associated with the amortization of acquisition-related fair value adjustments 8 5 10 22 11 32 Restructuring and other charges (credits), net 126 147 (2 ) Total $ 148 $ 158 $ 30 See discussion of operating income below under "Segment Results."

In fiscal 2016, we recorded net other expense primarily pursuant to the Tax Sharing Agreement with Tyco International plc ("Tyco International") and Covidien plc ("Covidien"). See Note 16 to the Consolidated Financial Statements for further information regarding net other income (expense). Income Taxes. See Note 15 to the Consolidated Financial Statements for information regarding items impacting income tax expense (benefit) and the effective tax rate for fiscal 2018, 2017, and 2016 and information regarding the Tax Cuts and Jobs Act (the "Act"). We do not expect a significant change in our effective tax rate on future results of operations as a result of the Act. The valuation allowance for deferred tax assets was $2,191 million and $3,627 million at fiscal year end 2018 and 2017, respectively. See Note 15 to the Consolidated Financial Statements for further information regarding the valuation allowance for deferred tax assets. As of fiscal year end 2018, certain subsidiaries had approximately $23 billion of cumulative undistributed earnings that have been retained indefinitely and reinvested in our global manufacturing operations, including working capital; property, plant, and equipment; intangible assets; and research and development activities. See Note 15 to the Consolidated Financial Statements for additional information regarding undistributed earnings. Income (Loss) from Discontinued Operations, Net of Income Taxes. On September 16, 2018, we entered into a definitive agreement to sell our SubCom business. The net sales of the business were $702 million, $928 million, $886 million in fiscal 2018, 2017, and 2016, respectively. In fiscal 2018, net sales and operating income were negatively impacted by production delays on a program. In fiscal 2017, net sales increased as a result of higher project activity and operating income was positively impacted by lower material costs and improved manufacturing productivity as compared to fiscal 2016. 30 Table of Contents In connection with the sale of the SubCom business, in fiscal 2018, we recorded a pre-tax impairment charge of $19 million, which is included in income (loss) from discontinued operations on the Consolidated Statement of Operations, to write the carrying value of the business down to its estimated fair value less costs to sell. We expect to incur a pre-tax loss on sale of approximately $90 million, related primarily to the recognition of cumulative translation adjustment losses and certain guarantee liabilities, which will be presented in income (loss) from discontinued operations on the Consolidated Statement of Operations. In November 2018, we completed the sale of the SubCom business for $325 million. The proceeds received are subject to a final working capital adjustment. During fiscal 2016, we settled a lawsuit with the former shareholders of Com-Net, which we acquired in fiscal 2001, and recorded pre-tax credits of $30 million representing a release of excess reserves. This amount was reflected in income (loss) from discontinued operations on the Consolidated Statement of Operations as the Com-Net case was associated with our former Wireless Systems business which was sold in fiscal 2009. Also during fiscal 2016, we recognized an additional pre-tax gain of $29 million on the fiscal 2015 divestiture of our Broadband Network Solutions ("BNS") business, related primarily to pension and net working capital adjustments. See Notes 4 and 23 to the Consolidated Financial Statements for additional information regarding discontinued operations. Segment Results Transportation Solutions Net Sales.

Energy Our organic net sales decreased 1.0% in fiscal 2017 due to declines in the EMEA and Americas regions, partially offset by growth in the Asia Pacific region. Operating Income. The following table presents the Industrial Solutions segment's operating income and operating margin information: Fiscal Fiscal 2018 versus 2017 Fiscal 2017 versus 2016 2018 2017 2016 ($ in millions) Operating income $ 465 $ 364 $ 353 $ 101 $ 11 Operating margin 12.1 % 10.4 % 11.0 % Operating income in the Industrial Solutions segment increased $101 million in fiscal 2018 as compared to fiscal 2017 and increased $11 million in fiscal 2017 as compared to fiscal 2016. The Industrial Solutions segment's operating income included the following: Fiscal 2018 2017 2016 (in millions) Acquisition related charges: Acquisition and integration costs $ 6 $ 3 $ 13 Charges associated with the amortization of acquisition-related fair value adjustments 4 5 10 10 8 23 Restructuring and other charges, net 80 74 31 Total $ 90 $ 82 $ 54 34 Table of Contents Excluding these items, operating income increased in fiscal 2018 due primarily to higher volume. Excluding these items, operating income increased in fiscal 2017 primarily as a result of higher volume, partially offset by price erosion. Communications Solutions Net Sales. The following table presents the Communications Solutions segment's net sales and the percentage of total net sales by primary industry end market (1) : Fiscal 2018 2017 2016 ($ in millions) Data and devices $ 1,068 58 % $ 963 59 % $ 1,019 62 % Appliances 774 42 676 41 615 38 Total $ 1,842 100 % $ 1,639 100 % $ 1,634 100 % (1) Industry end market information is presented consistently with our internal management reporting and may be revised periodically as management deems necessary. The following table provides an analysis of the change in the Communications Solutions segment's net sales compared to the prior fiscal year by primary industry end market: Fiscal 2018 2017 Change in Net Sales versus Prior Fiscal Year Change in Net Sales versus Prior Fiscal Year Net Sales Growth Organic Net Sales Growth Translation Net Sales Growth Organic Net Sales Growth Translation Divestiture ($ in millions) Data and devices $ 105 10.9 % $ 91 9.5 % $ 14 $ (56 ) (5.5 )% $ 24 2.3 % $ (10 ) $ (70 ) Appliances 98 14.5 81 12.0 17 61 9.9 67 10.8 (6 ) Total $ 203 12.4 % $ 172 10.5 % $ 31 $ 5 0.3 % $ 91 5.7 % $ (16 ) $ (70 ) In fiscal 2018, net sales in the Communications Solutions segment increased $203 million, or 12.4%, as compared to fiscal 2017 due to organic net sales growth of 10.5% and the positive impact of foreign currency translation of 1.9%. Our organic net sales by primary industry end market were as follows: Data and devices Our organic net sales increased 9.5% in fiscal 2018 as a result of growth in all regions, primarily attributable to growth in high speed connectivity in data center applications. Appliances Our organic net sales increased 12.0% in fiscal 2018 as a result of growth in all regions and market share gains. Net sales in the Communications Solutions segment increased $5 million in fiscal 2017 as compared to fiscal 2016. Organic net sales growth of 5.7% was largely offset by sales declines resulting from a divestiture of 4.3% and the negative impact of foreign currency translation of 1.1%. Fiscal 2016 included an additional week which contributed $32 million in net sales. Our organic net sales by primary industry end market were as follows: Data and devices Our organic net sales increased 2.3% in fiscal 2017 primarily as a result of increased sales to cloud infrastructure customers, partially offset by sales declines resulting from weakness in the wireless market. Appliances Our organic net sales increased 10.8% in fiscal 2017 due primarily to growth in the Asia Pacific region as a result of increased market demand and share gains. 35 Table of Contents Operating Income. The following table presents the Communications Solutions segment's operating income and operating margin information: Fiscal Fiscal 2018 versus 2017 Fiscal 2017 versus 2016 2018 2017 2016 ($ in millions) Operating income $ 288 $ 218 $ 246 $ 70 $ (28 ) Operating margin 15.6 % 13.3 % 15.1 % In the Communications Solutions segment, operating income increased $70 million in fiscal 2018 as compared to fiscal 2017 and decreased $28 million in fiscal 2017 as compared to fiscal 2016. The Communications Solutions segment's operating income included the following: Fiscal 2018 2017 2016 (in millions) Restructuring and other charges (credits), net $ 13 $ 4 $ (80 ) (1) (1) Includes pre-tax gain of $144 million on the sale of our CPD business during fiscal 2016. Excluding these items, operating income increased in both fiscal 2018 and 2017 due primarily to higher volume and improved manufacturing productivity, partially offset by price erosion. Liquidity and Capital Resources Our ability to fund our future capital needs will be affected by our ability to continue to generate cash from operations and may be affected by our ability to access the capital markets, money markets, or other sources of funding, as well as the capacity and terms of our financing arrangements. We believe that cash generated from operations and, to the extent necessary, these other sources of potential funding will be sufficient to meet our anticipated capital needs for the foreseeable future, including the payment of $325 million of 2.375% senior notes and $250 million of 2.35% senior notes due in fiscal 2019. We may use excess cash to purchase a portion of our common shares pursuant to our authorized share repurchase program, to acquire strategic businesses or product lines, to pay dividends on our common shares, or to reduce our outstanding debt. The cost or availability of future funding may be impacted by financial market conditions. We will continue to monitor financial markets and respond as necessary to changing conditions. As of fiscal year end 2018, our cash and cash equivalents were held in subsidiaries which are located in various countries throughout the world. Under current applicable laws, substantially all of these amounts can be repatriated to Tyco Electronics Group S.A. ("TEGSA"), our Luxembourg subsidiary, which is the obligor of substantially all of our debt, and to TE Connectivity Ltd., our Swiss parent company; however, the repatriation of these amounts could subject us to additional tax expense. We provide for tax liabilities on the Consolidated Financial Statements with respect to amounts that we expect to repatriate; however, no tax liabilities are recorded for amounts that we consider to be retained indefinitely and reinvested in our global manufacturing operations. As of fiscal year end 2018, we had approximately $11.6 billion of cash, cash equivalents, and intercompany deposits, principally in our subsidiaries, that we have the ability to distribute to TEGSA and TE Connectivity Ltd. but we consider to be permanently reinvested. We estimate that up to $0.9 billion of tax expense would be recognized on the Consolidated Financial Statements if our intention to permanently reinvest these amounts were to change. Our current plans do not demonstrate a need to repatriate cash, cash equivalents, and intercompany deposits that are designated as permanently reinvested in order to fund our operations, including investing and financing activities. 36 Table of Contents Cash Flows from Operating Activities Net cash provided by continuing operating activities increased $28 million to $2,301 million in fiscal 2018 as compared to $2,273 million in fiscal 2017. The increase resulted primarily from higher pre-tax income levels, substantially offset by the impact of higher working capital to support increased business levels and increased incentive compensation payments. Net cash provided by continuing operating activities increased $340 million to $2,273 million in fiscal 2017 as compared to $1,933 million in fiscal 2016. The increase resulted primarily from higher pre-tax income levels, an increase in accrued and other current liabilities related primarily to incentive compensation, and a decrease in net payments related to pre-separation tax matters, partially offset by the impact of increased sales on accounts receivable levels. The amount of income taxes paid, net of refunds, during fiscal 2018, 2017, and 2016 was $393 million, $323 million, and $806 million, respectively. In fiscal 2017 and 2016, these amounts included refunds of $23 million and payments of $471 million, respectively, related to pre-separation tax matters. During fiscal 2016, we received net reimbursements of $321 million from Tyco International and Covidien pursuant to their indemnifications for pre-separation tax matters. We do not expect a significant change in our income tax payments as a result of the Tax Cuts and Jobs Act. See Note 15 to the Consolidated Financial Statements for further information regarding the Tax Sharing Agreement and payments related to pre-separation tax matters. Pension contributions in fiscal 2018, 2017, and 2016 were $54 million, $48 million, and $67 million, respectively. We expect pension contributions to be $47 million in fiscal 2019, before consideration of any voluntary contributions. Cash Flows from Investing Activities Capital expenditures were $935 million, $679 million, and $603 million in fiscal 2018, 2017, and 2016, respectively. Capital spending increased in fiscal 2018 as a result of increased investments in growth initiatives, primarily in the Transportation Solutions segment. We expect fiscal 2019 capital spending levels to be approximately 5-6% of net sales. We believe our capital funding levels are adequate to support new programs, and we continue to invest in our manufacturing infrastructure to further enhance productivity and manufacturing capabilities. During fiscal 2018, we acquired two businesses for a combined cash purchase price of $153 million, net of cash acquired. We acquired two businesses during fiscal 2017 for a combined cash purchase price of $250 million, net of cash acquired. In fiscal 2016, we acquired four businesses, including Creganna, for a combined cash purchase price of $1.3 billion, net of cash acquired. See Note 5 to the Consolidated Financial Statements for additional information regarding acquisitions. During fiscal 2016, we received net cash proceeds of $333 million related to the sale of our CPD business. See Note 3 to the Consolidated Financial Statements for further information. Cash Flows from Financing Activities and Capitalization Total debt at fiscal year end 2018 and 2017 was $4,000 million and $4,344 million, respectively. See Note 11 to the Consolidated Financial Statements for additional information regarding debt. TEGSA, our 100%-owned subsidiary, has a five-year unsecured senior revolving credit facility ("Credit Facility") with a maturity date of December 2020 and total commitments of $1,500 million. TEGSA had no borrowings under the Credit Facility at fiscal year end 2018 or 2017. The Credit Facility contains a financial ratio covenant providing that if, as of the last day of each fiscal quarter, our ratio of Consolidated Total Debt to Consolidated EBITDA (as defined in the Credit 37 Table of Contents Facility) for the then most recently concluded period of four consecutive fiscal quarters exceeds 3.75 to 1.0, an Event of Default (as defined in the Credit Facility) is triggered. The Credit Facility and our other debt agreements contain other customary covenants. None of our covenants are presently considered restrictive to our operations. As of fiscal year end 2018, we were in compliance with all of our debt covenants and believe that we will continue to be in compliance with our existing covenants for the foreseeable future. Periodically, TEGSA issues commercial paper to U.S. institutional accredited investors and qualified institutional buyers in accordance with available exemptions from the registration requirements of the Securities Act of 1933 as part of our ongoing effort to maintain financial flexibility and to potentially decrease the cost of borrowings. Borrowings under the commercial paper program are backed by the Credit Facility. TEGSA's payment obligations under its senior notes, commercial paper, and Credit Facility are fully and unconditionally guaranteed by its parent, TE Connectivity Ltd. Payments of common share dividends to shareholders were $588 million, $546 million, and $509 million in fiscal 2018, 2017, and 2016, respectively. See Note 18 to the Consolidated Financial Statements for additional information regarding dividends on our common shares. Future dividends on our common shares, if any, must be approved by our shareholders. In exercising their discretion to recommend to the shareholders that such dividends be approved, our board of directors will consider our results of operations, cash requirements and surplus, financial condition, statutory requirements of applicable law, contractual restrictions, and other factors that they may deem relevant. During fiscal 2018 and 2016, our board of directors authorized increases of $1.5 billion and $1.0 billion, respectively, in the share repurchase program. We repurchased approximately 10 million of our common shares for $966 million, 8 million of our common shares for $621 million, and 43 million of our common shares for $2,610 million under the share repurchase program during fiscal 2018, 2017, and 2016, respectively. At fiscal year end 2018, we had $1.0 billion of availability remaining under our share repurchase authorization. Commitments and Contingencies The following table provides a summary of our contractual obligations and commitments for debt, minimum lease payment obligations under non-cancelable leases, and other obligations at fiscal year end 2018: Payments Due by Fiscal Year Total 2019 2020 2021 2022 2023 Thereafter (in millions) Debt (1) $ 4,021 $ 963 $ $ 252 $ 501 $ 639 $ 1,666 Interest payments on debt (2) 1,092 119 109 103 88 79 594 Operating leases 403 97 76 62 48 38 82 Purchase obligations (3) 820 798 17 2 3 Total contractual cash obligations (4)(5)(6) $ 6,336 $ 1,977 $ 202 $ 419 $ 637 $ 756 $ 2,345 (1) Debt represents principal payments. See Note 11 to the Consolidated Financial Statements for additional information regarding debt. (2) Interest payments exclude the impact of our interest rate swap contracts. (3) Purchase obligations consist primarily of commitments for purchases of goods and services. 38 Table of Contents (4) The above table does not reflect unrecognized income tax benefits of $566 million and related accrued interest and penalties of $60 million, the timing of which is uncertain. See Note 15 to the Consolidated Financial Statements for additional information regarding unrecognized income tax benefits, interest, and penalties. (5) The above table does not reflect pension obligations to certain employees and former employees. We are obligated to make contributions to our pension plans; however, we are unable to determine the amount of plan contributions due to the inherent uncertainties of obligations of this type, including timing, interest rate charges, investment performance, and amounts of benefit payments. We expect to contribute $47 million to pension plans in fiscal 2019, before consideration of any voluntary contributions. See Note 14 to the Consolidated Financial Statements for additional information regarding these plans and our estimates of future contributions and benefit payments. (6) Other long-term liabilities of $487 million are excluded from the above table as we are unable to estimate the timing of payment for these items. Legal Proceedings In the normal course of business, we are subject to various legal proceedings and claims, including patent infringement claims, product liability matters, employment disputes, disputes on agreements, other commercial disputes, environmental matters, antitrust claims, and tax matters, including non-income tax matters such as value added tax, sales and use tax, real estate tax, and transfer tax. Although it is not feasible to predict the outcome of these proceedings, based upon our experience, current information, and applicable law, we do not expect that the outcome of these proceedings, either individually or in the aggregate, will have a material effect on our results of operations, financial position, or cash flows. Off-Balance Sheet Arrangements In certain instances, we have guaranteed the performance of third parties and provided financial guarantees for uncompleted work and financial commitments. The terms of these guarantees vary with end dates ranging from fiscal 2019 through the completion of such transactions. The guarantees would be triggered in the event of nonperformance, and the potential exposure for nonperformance under the guarantees would not have a material effect on our results of operations, financial position, or cash flows. In disposing of assets or businesses, we often provide representations, warranties, and/or indemnities to cover various risks including unknown damage to assets, environmental risks involved in the sale of real estate, liability for investigation and remediation of environmental contamination at waste disposal sites and manufacturing facilities, and unidentified tax liabilities and legal fees related to periods prior to disposition. We do not expect that these uncertainties will have a material adverse effect on our results of operations, financial position, or cash flows. At fiscal year end 2018, we had outstanding letters of credit, letters of guarantee, and surety bonds of $275 million. As discussed above, in September 2018, we entered into a definitive agreement to sell our SubCom business. Following the divestiture, we will continue to honor performance guarantees and letters of credit related to the SubCom business' existing projects. These existing guarantees have a combined value of approximately $1.7 billion and are expected to expire at various dates through fiscal 2025; however, the majority are expected to expire within two years. Also, under the terms of the definitive agreement, we are required to issue up to $300 million of new performance guarantees, subject to certain limitations, for projects entered into by the SubCom business following the sale for a period of up to three years. We have contractual recourse against the SubCom business if we are required to perform on these guarantees; however, based on historical experience, we do not anticipate having to 39 Table of Contents perform. See Notes 4 and 23 to the Consolidated Financial Statements for additional information regarding the divestiture of the SubCom business. Critical Accounting Policies and Estimates The preparation of the Consolidated Financial Statements in conformity with GAAP requires management to make estimates and assumptions that affect the reported amounts of assets and liabilities, the disclosure of contingent assets and liabilities, and the reported amounts of revenue and expenses. Our significant accounting policies are summarized in Note 2 to the Consolidated Financial Statements. We believe the following accounting policies are the most critical as they require significant judgments and assumptions that involve inherent risks and uncertainties. Management's estimates are based on the relevant information available at the end of each period. Revenue Recognition Our revenue recognition policies are in accordance with Accounting Standards Codification ("ASC") 605, Revenue Recognition . Our revenues are generated principally from the sale of our products. Revenue from the sale of products is recognized at the time title and the risks and rewards of ownership pass to the customer. This generally occurs when the products reach the shipping point, the sales price is fixed and determinable, and collection is reasonably assured. A reserve for estimated returns is established at the time of sale based on historical return experience and is recorded as a reduction of sales. Other allowances include customer quantity and price discrepancies. A reserve for other allowances is generally established at the time of sale based on historical experience and also is recorded as a reduction of sales. Contract revenues for construction related projects, which are generated in the SubCom business which is reported in discontinued operations, are recorded primarily using the percentage-of-completion method. Profits recognized on contracts in process are based upon estimated contract revenue and related cost to complete. Percentage-of-completion is measured based on the ratio of actual costs incurred to total estimated costs. Revisions in cost estimates as contracts progress have the effect of increasing or decreasing profits in the current period. Provisions for anticipated losses are made in the period in which they first become determinable. In addition, provisions for credit losses related to unbilled receivables on construction related projects are recorded as reductions of revenue in the period in which they first become determinable. See Notes 4 and 23 to the Consolidated Financial Statements for additional information regarding the SubCom business. See Note 2 to the Consolidated Financial Statements for information regarding our adoption of ASC 606, Revenue from Contracts with Customers , in fiscal 2019. Goodwill and Other Intangible Assets Intangible assets include both indeterminable-lived residual goodwill and determinable-lived identifiable intangible assets. Intangible assets with determinable lives primarily include intellectual property, consisting of patents, trademarks, and unpatented technology, and customer relationships. Recoverability estimates range from 1 to 50 years and costs are generally amortized on a straight-line basis. Evaluations of the remaining useful lives of determinable-lived intangible assets are performed on a periodic basis and when events and circumstances warrant. We test for goodwill impairment at the reporting unit level. A reporting unit is generally an operating segment or one level below an operating segment (a "component") if the component constitutes a business for which discrete financial information is available and regularly reviewed by segment management. At fiscal year end 2018, we had five reporting units, all of which contained goodwill. There were two reporting units in both the Transportation Solutions and Industrial Solutions segments and one reporting unit in the Communications Solutions segment. When changes occur in the 40 Table of Contents composition of one or more reporting units, goodwill is reassigned to the reporting units affected based on their relative fair values. We review our reporting unit structure each year as part of our annual goodwill impairment test, or more frequently based on changes in our structure. Goodwill impairment is evaluated by comparing the carrying value of each reporting unit to its fair value on the first day of the fourth fiscal quarter of each year or whenever we believe a triggering event requiring a more frequent assessment has occurred. In assessing the existence of a triggering event, management relies on a number of reporting unit-specific factors including operating results, business plans, economic projections, anticipated future cash flows, transactions, and market place data. There are inherent uncertainties related to these factors and management's judgment in applying these factors to the impairment analysis. When testing for goodwill impairment, we perform a step I goodwill impairment test to identify potential impairment by comparing the fair value of a reporting unit with its carrying amount. If the carrying amount of a reporting unit exceeds its fair value, goodwill may be impaired and a step II goodwill impairment test is performed to measure the amount of impairment, if any. In the step II goodwill impairment test, we compare the implied fair value of reporting unit goodwill with the carrying amount of that goodwill. If the carrying amount of reporting unit goodwill exceeds the implied fair value of that goodwill, an impairment loss is recognized in an amount equal to the excess. The implied fair value of goodwill is determined in a manner consistent with how goodwill is recognized in a business combination. We allocate the fair value of a reporting unit to the assets and liabilities of that unit, including intangible assets, as if the reporting unit had been acquired in a business combination. Any excess of the fair value of a reporting unit over the amounts assigned to its assets and liabilities is the implied fair value of goodwill. Fair value estimates used in the step I goodwill impairment tests are calculated using an income approach based on the present value of future cash flows of each reporting unit. The income approach has been supported by guideline analyses (a market approach). These approaches incorporate a number of assumptions including future growth rates, discount rates, income tax rates, and market activity in assessing fair value and are reporting unit specific. Changes in economic and operating conditions impacting these assumptions could result in goodwill impairments in future periods. We completed our annual goodwill impairment test in the fourth quarter of fiscal 2018 and determined that no impairment existed. Income Taxes In determining income for financial statement purposes, we must make certain estimates and judgments. These estimates and judgments affect the calculation of certain tax liabilities and the determination of the recoverability of certain deferred tax assets, which arise from temporary differences between the income tax return and financial statement recognition of revenue and expense. In evaluating our ability to recover our deferred tax assets, we consider all available positive and negative evidence including our past operating results, the existence of cumulative losses in the most recent years, and our forecast of taxable income. In estimating future taxable income, we develop assumptions including the amount of pre-tax operating income in various tax jurisdictions, the reversal of temporary differences, and the implementation of feasible and prudent tax planning strategies. These assumptions require significant judgment about the forecasts of taxable income and are consistent with the plans and estimates we are using to manage the underlying businesses. We currently have recorded significant valuation allowances that we intend to maintain until it is more likely than not the deferred tax assets will be realized. Our income tax expense recorded in the future will be reduced to the extent of decreases in our valuation allowances. The realization of our remaining deferred tax assets is dependent primarily on future taxable income in the appropriate 41 Table of Contents jurisdictions. Any reduction in future taxable income including any future restructuring activities may require that we record an additional valuation allowance against our deferred tax assets. An increase in the valuation allowance would result in additional income tax expense in such period and could have a significant impact on our future earnings. Changes in tax laws and rates also could affect recorded deferred tax assets and liabilities in the future. Management is not aware of any such changes that would have a material effect on our results of operations, financial position, or cash flows. In addition, the calculation of our tax liabilities includes estimates for uncertainties in the application of complex tax regulations across multiple global jurisdictions where we conduct our operations. Under the uncertain tax position provisions of ASC 740, Income Taxes , we recognize liabilities for tax and related interest for issues in tax jurisdictions based on our estimate of whether, and the extent to which, additional taxes and related interest will be due. These tax liabilities and related interest are reflected net of the impact of related tax loss carryforwards, as such tax loss carryforwards will be applied against these tax liabilities and will reduce the amount of cash tax payments due upon the eventual settlement with the tax authorities. These estimates may change due to changing facts and circumstances. Due to the complexity of these uncertainties, the ultimate resolution may result in a settlement that differs from our current estimate of the tax liabilities and related interest. These tax liabilities and related interest are recorded in income taxes and accrued and other current liabilities on the Consolidated Balance Sheets. Pension Liabilities Our defined benefit pension plan expense and obligations are developed from actuarial assumptions. The funded status of our plans is recognized on the Consolidated Balance Sheets and is measured as the difference between the fair value of plan assets and the projected benefit obligation at the measurement date. The projected benefit obligation represents the actuarial present value of benefits projected to be paid upon retirement factoring in estimated future compensation levels. The fair value of plan assets represents the current market value of cumulative company and participant contributions made to irrevocable trust funds, held for the sole benefit of participants, which are invested by the trustee of the funds. The benefits under our defined benefit pension plans are based on various factors, such as years of service and compensation. Net periodic pension benefit cost is based on the utilization of the projected unit credit method of calculation and is charged to earnings on a systematic basis over the expected average remaining service lives of current participants. Two critical assumptions in determining pension expense and obligations are the discount rate and expected long-term return on plan assets. We evaluate these assumptions at least annually. Other assumptions reflect demographic factors such as retirement, mortality, and employee turnover. These assumptions are evaluated periodically and updated to reflect our actual experience. Actual results may differ from actuarial assumptions. The discount rate represents the market rate for high-quality fixed income investments and is used to calculate the present value of the expected future cash flows for benefit obligations to be paid under our pension plans. A decrease in the discount rate increases the present value of pension benefit obligations. At fiscal year end 2018, a 25 basis point decrease in the discount rate would have increased the present value of our pension obligations by $124 million; a 25 basis point increase would have decreased the present value of our pension obligations by $111 million. We consider the current and expected asset allocations of our pension plans, as well as historical and expected long-term rates of return on those types of plan assets, in determining the expected long-term rate of return on plan assets. A 50 basis point decrease or increase in the expected long-term return on plan assets would have increased or decreased, respectively, our fiscal 2018 pension expense by $12 million. 42 Table of Contents At fiscal year end 2018, the long-term target asset allocation in our U.S. plans' master trust is 10% return-seeking assets and 90% liability-hedging assets. Asset re-allocation to meet that target is occurring over a multi-year period based on the funded status. We expect to reach our target allocation when the funded status of the plans exceeds 105%. Based on the funded status of the plans as of fiscal year end 2018, our target asset allocation is 45% return-seeking and 55% liability-hedging. Accounting Pronouncements See Note 2 to the Consolidated Financial Statements for information regarding recently issued and recently adopted accounting pronouncements. Non-GAAP Financial Measure Organic Net Sales Growth We present organic net sales growth as we believe it is appropriate for investors to consider this adjusted financial measure in addition to results in accordance with GAAP. Organic net sales growth represents net sales growth (the most comparable GAAP financial measure) excluding the impact of foreign currency exchange rates, and acquisitions and divestitures that occurred in the preceding twelve months, if any. Organic net sales growth is a useful measure of our performance because it excludes items that are not completely under management's control, such as the impact of changes in foreign currency exchange rates, and items that do not reflect the underlying growth of the company, such as acquisition and divestiture activity. Organic net sales growth provides useful information about our results and the trends of our business. Management uses organic net sales growth to monitor and evaluate performance. Also, management uses organic net sales growth together with GAAP financial measures in its decision-making processes related to the operations of our reportable segments and our overall company. It is also a significant component in our incentive compensation plans. We believe that investors benefit from having access to the same financial measures that management uses in evaluating operations. The tables presented in "Results of Operations" and "Segment Results" provide reconciliations of organic net sales growth to net sales growth calculated in accordance with GAAP. Organic net sales growth is a non-GAAP financial measure and should not be considered a replacement for results in accordance with GAAP. This non-GAAP financial measure may not be comparable to similarly-titled measures reported by other companies. The primary limitation of this measure is that it excludes the financial impact of items that would otherwise either increase or decrease our reported results. This limitation is best addressed by using organic net sales growth in combination with net sales growth in order to better understand the amounts, character, and impact of any increase or decrease in reported amounts.
