ITEM 7. MANAGEMENT'S DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS OF FINANCIAL CONDITION AND RESULTS OF OPERATIONS The following discussion and analysis should be read in combination with our consolidated financial statements included in Item 8 herein. OVERVIEW BACKGROUND We are a public utility holding company whose indirect wholly owned subsidiaries include: - CenterPoint Energy Houston Electric, LLC (CenterPoint Houston), which provides electric transmission and distribution services to retail electric providers serving approximately 1.9 million metered customers in a 5,000-square-mile area of the Texas Gulf Coast that has a population of approximately 4.8 million people and includes Houston; and - CenterPoint Energy Resources Corp. (CERC Corp. and, together with its subsidiaries, CERC), which owns gas distribution systems serving approximately 3.1 million customers in Arkansas, Louisiana, Minnesota, Mississippi, Oklahoma and Texas. Through wholly owned subsidiaries, CERC also owns two interstate natural gas pipelines and gas gathering systems, provides various ancillary services, and offers variable and fixed-price physical natural gas supplies primarily to commercial and industrial customers and electric and gas utilities. We were a registered public utility holding company under the Public Utility Holding Company Act of 1935, as amended (the 1935 Act). The 1935 Act and related rules and regulations imposed a number of restrictions on our activities and those of our subsidiaries. The Energy Policy Act of 2005 (Energy Act) repealed the 1935 Act effective February 8, 2006, and since that date we and our subsidiaries have no longer been subject to restrictions imposed under the 1935 Act. The Energy Act includes a new Public Utility Holding Company Act of 2005 (PUHCA 2005), which grants to the Federal Energy Regulatory Commission (FERC) authority to require holding companies and their subsidiaries to maintain certain books and records and make them available for review by the FERC and state regulatory authorities in certain circumstances. On December 8, 2005, the FERC issued rules implementing PUHCA 2005 that will require us to notify the FERC of our status as a holding company and to maintain certain books and records and make these available to the FERC. The FERC continues to consider motions for rehearing or clarification of these rules. BUSINESS SEGMENTS In this section, we discuss our results from continuing operations on a consolidated basis and individually for each of our business segments. We also discuss our liquidity, capital resources and critical accounting policies. CenterPoint Energy is first and foremost an energy delivery company and it is our intention to remain focused on this segment of the energy business. The results of our business operations are significantly impacted by weather, customer growth, cost management, rate proceedings before regulatory agencies and other actions of the various regulatory agencies to which we are subject. Our transmission and distribution services are subject to rate regulation and are reported in the Electric Transmission & Distribution business segment, as are impacts of generation-related stranded costs and other true-up balances recoverable by the regulated electric utility. Our natural gas distribution services are also subject to rate regulation and are reported in the Natural Gas Distribution business segment. Our reportable business segments include: Electric Transmission & Distribution Our electric transmission and distribution operations provide electric transmission and distribution services to retail electric providers serving approximately 1.9 million metered customers in a 5,000-square-mile area of the Texas Gulf coast that has a population of approximately 4.8 million people and includes Houston. 32 <PAGE> On behalf of retail electric providers, CenterPoint Houston delivers electricity from power plants to substations and from one substation to another and to retail electric customers in locations throughout the control area managed by the Electric Reliability Council of Texas, Inc. (ERCOT). ERCOT serves as the regional reliability coordinating council for member electric power systems in Texas. ERCOT membership is open to consumer groups, investor and municipally owned electric utilities, rural electric cooperatives, independent generators, power marketers and retail electric providers. The ERCOT market represents approximately 85% of the demand for power in Texas and is one of the nation's largest power markets. Transmission services are provided under tariffs approved by the Public Utility Commission of Texas (Texas Utility Commission). Operations include construction and maintenance of electric transmission and distribution facilities, metering services, outage response services and other call center operations. Distribution services are provided under tariffs approved by the Texas Utility Commission. Natural Gas Distribution CERC owns and operates our regulated natural gas distribution business, which engages in intrastate natural gas sales to, and natural gas transportation for, approximately 3.1 million residential, commercial and industrial customers in Arkansas, Louisiana, Minnesota, Mississippi, Oklahoma and Texas. Competitive Natural Gas Sales and Services CERC's operations also include non-rate regulated natural gas sales and services provided primarily to commercial and industrial customers and electric and gas utilities throughout the central and eastern United States. We have reorganized the oversight of our Natural Gas Distribution business segment and, as a result, beginning in the fourth quarter of 2005, we have established a new reportable business segment, Competitive Natural Gas Sales and Services. These operations were previously reported as part of the Natural Gas Distribution business segment. We have reclassified all prior period segment information to conform to this new presentation. Pipelines and Field Services CERC's pipelines and field services business owns and operates approximately 8,200 miles of gas transmission lines primarily located in Arkansas, Illinois, Louisiana, Missouri, Oklahoma and Texas. CERC's pipelines and field services business also owns and operates six natural gas storage fields with a combined daily deliverability of approximately 1.2 Bcf per day and a combined working gas capacity of approximately 59.0 Bcf. Most storage operations are in north Louisiana and Oklahoma. CERC's pipelines and field services business also owns and operates approximately 4,000 miles of gathering pipelines that collect, treat and process natural gas from approximately 200 separate systems located in major producing fields in Arkansas, Louisiana, Oklahoma and Texas. Other Operations Our Other Operations business segment includes office buildings and other real estate used in our business operations and other corporate operations which support all of our business operations. 33 <PAGE> EXECUTIVE SUMMARY SIGNIFICANT EVENTS IN 2005 RECOVERY OF TRUE-UP BALANCE/SECURITIZATION FINANCING The Texas Electric Choice Plan (Texas electric restructuring law), which became effective in September 1999, substantially amended the regulatory structure governing electric utilities in order to allow retail competition for electric customers beginning in January 2002. The Texas electric restructuring law requires the Texas Utility Commission to conduct a "true-up" proceeding to determine CenterPoint Houston's stranded costs and certain other costs resulting from the transition to a competitive retail electric market and to provide for its recovery of those costs. In March 2004, CenterPoint Houston filed its true-up application with the Texas Utility Commission, requesting recovery of $3.7 billion, excluding interest. In December 2004, the Texas Utility Commission issued its final order (True-Up Order) allowing CenterPoint Houston to recover a true-up balance of approximately $2.3 billion, which included interest through August 31, 2004, and providing for adjustment of the amount to be recovered to include interest on the balance until recovery, the principal portion of additional excess mitigation credits returned to customers after August 31, 2004 and certain other matters. CenterPoint Houston and other parties filed appeals of the True-Up Order to a district court in Travis County, Texas. In August 2005, the court issued its final judgment on the various appeals. In its judgment, the court affirmed most aspects of the True-Up Order, but reversed two of the Texas Utility Commission's rulings. The judgment would have the effect of restoring approximately $650 million, plus interest, of the $1.7 billion the Texas Utility Commission had disallowed from CenterPoint Houston's initial request. First, the court reversed the Texas Utility Commission's decision to prohibit CenterPoint Houston from recovering $180 million in credits through August 2004 that CenterPoint Houston was ordered to provide to retail electric providers as a result of an inaccurate stranded cost estimate made by the Texas Utility Commission in 2000. Additional credits of approximately $30 million were paid after August 2004. Second, the court reversed the Texas Utility Commission's disallowance of $440 million in transition costs which are recoverable under the Texas Utility Commission's regulations. CenterPoint Houston and other parties appealed the district court decisions. Briefs have been filed with the 3rd Court of Appeals in Austin but oral argument has not yet been scheduled. There are two ways for CenterPoint Houston to recover the true-up balance: by issuing transition bonds to securitize the amounts due and/or by implementing a competition transition charge (CTC). Pursuant to a financing order issued by the Texas Utility Commission in March 2005 and affirmed in all respects in August 2005 by the same Travis County District Court considering the appeal of the True-Up Order, in December 2005 a subsidiary of CenterPoint Houston issued $1.85 billion in transition bonds with interest rates ranging from 4.84 percent to 5.30 percent and final maturity dates ranging from February 2011 to August 2020. Through issuance of the transition bonds, CenterPoint Houston recovered approximately $1.7 billion of the true-up balance determined in the True-Up Order plus interest through the date on which the bonds were issued. In July 2005, CenterPoint Houston received an order from the Texas Utility Commission allowing it to implement a CTC which will collect approximately $596 million over 14 years plus interest at an annual rate of 11.075 percent (CTC Order). The CTC Order authorizes CenterPoint Houston to impose a charge on retail electric providers to recover the portion of the true-up balance not covered by the financing order. The CTC Order also allows CenterPoint Houston to collect approximately $24 million of rate case expenses over three years through a separate tariff rider (Rider RCE). CenterPoint Houston implemented the CTC and Rider RCE effective September 13, 2005 and began recovering approximately $620 million. During the period from September 13, 2005, the date of implementation of the CTC Order, through December 31, 2005, CenterPoint Houston recognized approximately $21 million in CTC operating income. Certain parties appealed the CTC Order to the Travis County Court in September 2005. Under the True-Up Order, CenterPoint Houston is allowed to recover carrying charges at 11.075 percent until the true-up balance is recovered. In January 2006, the Texas Utility Commission staff (Staff) proposed that the Texas Utility Commission adopt new rules governing the carrying charges on unrecovered true-up 34 <PAGE> balances. If the Texas Utility Commission adopts the rule as the Staff proposed it and the rule is deemed to apply to CenterPoint Houston, the rule would reduce carrying costs on the unrecovered CTC balance prospectively from 11.075 percent to the utility's cost of debt. CENTERPOINT HOUSTON RATE CASE The Texas Utility Commission requires each electric utility to file an annual Earnings Report providing certain information to enable the Texas Utility Commission to monitor the electric utilities' earnings and financial condition within the state. In May 2005, CenterPoint Houston filed its Earnings Report for the calendar year ended December 31, 2004. CenterPoint Houston's Earnings Report shows that it earned less than its authorized rate of return on equity in 2004. In October 2005, the Staff filed a memorandum summarizing its review of the Earnings Reports filed by electric utilities. Based on its review, the Staff concluded that continuation of CenterPoint Houston's rates could result in excess retail transmission and distribution revenues of as much as $105 million and excess wholesale transmission revenues of as much as $31 million annually and recommended that the Texas Utility Commission initiate a review of the reasonableness of existing rates. The Staff's analysis was based on a 9.60 percent cost of equity, which is 165 basis points lower than the approved return on equity from CenterPoint Houston's last rate proceeding, the elimination of interest on debt that matured in November 2005 and certain other adjustments to CenterPoint Houston's reported information. Additionally, a hypothetical capital structure of 60 percent debt and 40 percent equity was used which varies materially from the actual capital structure of CenterPoint Houston as of December 31, 2005 of approximately 50 percent debt and 50 percent equity. In December 2005, the Texas Utility Commission considered the Staff report and agreed to initiate a rate proceeding concerning the reasonableness of CenterPoint Houston's existing rates for transmission and distribution service and to require CenterPoint Houston to make a filing by April 15, 2006 to justify or change those rates. CITY OF HOUSTON FRANCHISE In June 2005, CenterPoint Houston accepted an ordinance granting it a new 30-year franchise to use the public rights-of-way to conduct its business in the City of Houston (New Franchise Ordinance). The New Franchise Ordinance took effect on July 1, 2005, and replaced the prior electricity franchise ordinance, which had been in effect since 1957. The New Franchise Ordinance clarifies certain operational obligations of CenterPoint Houston and the City of Houston and provides for streamlined payment and audit procedures and a two-year statute of limitations on claims for underpayment or overpayment under the ordinance. Under the prior electricity franchise ordinance, CenterPoint Houston paid annual franchise fees of $76.6 million to the City of Houston for the year ended December 31, 2004. For the twelve-month period beginning July 1, 2005, the annual franchise fee (Annual Franchise Fee) under the New Franchise Ordinance will include a base amount of $88.1 million (Base Amount) and an additional payment of $8.5 million (Additional Amount). The Base Amount and the Additional Amount will be adjusted annually based on the increase, if any, in kWh delivered by CenterPoint Houston within the City of Houston. CenterPoint Houston began paying the new annual franchise fees on July 1, 2005. Pursuant to the New Franchise Ordinance, the Annual Franchise Fee will be reduced prospectively to reflect any portion of the Annual Franchise Fee that is not included in CenterPoint Houston's base rates in any subsequent rate case. DEBT FINANCING TRANSACTIONS During the fourth quarter of 2005, CenterPoint Houston retired at maturity its $1.31 billion term loan, which bore interest at the London inter-bank offer rate (LIBOR) plus 975 basis points, subject to a minimum LIBOR rate of 3 percent. CenterPoint Houston used its $1.31 billion credit facility bearing interest at LIBOR plus 75 basis points to retire the term loan. Borrowings under the credit facility were subsequently repaid with a portion of the proceeds of the $1.85 billion transition bonds referred to above. 35 <PAGE> In August 2005, we accepted for exchange approximately $572 million aggregate principal amount of our 3.75% convertible senior notes due 2023 (Old Notes) for an equal amount of our new 3.75% convertible senior notes due 2023 (New Notes). Old Notes of approximately $3 million remain outstanding. We commenced the exchange offer in response to the guidance set forth in Emerging Issues Task Force (EITF) Issue No. 04-8, "Accounting Issues Related to Certain Features of Contingently Convertible Debt and the Effect on Diluted Earnings Per Share" (EITF 04-8). Under that guidance, because settlement of the principal portion of the New Notes will be made in cash rather than stock, the exchange of New Notes for Old Notes will allow us to exclude the portion of the conversion value of the New Notes attributable to their principal amount from our computation of diluted earnings per share from continuing operations. SALE OF TEXAS GENCO In July 2004, we announced our agreement to sell our majority-owned generating subsidiary, Texas Genco Holdings, Inc. (Texas Genco), to Texas Genco LLC. On December 15, 2004, Texas Genco completed the sale of its fossil generation assets (coal, lignite and gas-fired plants) to Texas Genco LLC for $2.813 billion in cash. Following the sale, Texas Genco, whose principal remaining asset was its ownership interest in a nuclear generating facility, distributed $2.231 billion in cash to us. The final step of the transaction, the merger of Texas Genco with a subsidiary of Texas Genco LLC in exchange for an additional cash payment to us of $700 million, was completed on April 13, 2005. The operations of Texas Genco, formerly presented as our Electric Generation business segment, are presented as discontinued operations. 2005 HIGHLIGHTS Our operating performance for 2005 compared to 2004 was affected by: - increased operating income of $55 million in our Pipelines and Field Services business segment primarily from increased demand for transportation resulting from basis differentials across the system and higher demand for ancillary services and increased throughput and demand for services related to our core gas gathering operations; - increased operating income of $16 million in our Competitive Natural Gas Sales and Services business segment primarily from higher sales to utilities and favorable basis differentials over the pipeline capacity that we control; - a decreased operating loss of $14 million in our Other Operations business segment primarily from increased overhead allocated in 2005; - continued customer growth, with the addition of 105,000 metered electric and gas customers; - a decrease in interest expense of $67 million; and - a decrease in the return on the true-up balance of $105 million in 2005, partially offset by an increase in operating income of $21 million related to the return on the true-up balance being recovered through the CTC. This decrease is primarily due to the recording of the return on the true-up balance for 2002 through 2004 in the fourth quarter of 2004. CERTAIN FACTORS AFFECTING FUTURE EARNINGS Our past earnings and results of operations are not necessarily indicative of our future earnings and results of operations. The magnitude of our future earnings and results of our operations will depend on or be affected by numerous factors including: - the timing and amount of our recovery of the true-up components, including, in particular, the results of appeals to the courts of determinations on rulings obtained to date; 36 <PAGE> - state and federal legislative and regulatory actions or developments, including deregulation, re-regulation, changes in or application of laws or regulations applicable to other aspects of our business and actions with respect to: - allowed rates of return; - rate structures; - recovery of investments; and - operation and construction of facilities; - timely and appropriate rate actions and increases, allowing recovery of costs and a reasonable return on investment; - industrial, commercial and residential growth in our service territory and changes in market demand and demographic patterns; - the timing and extent of changes in commodity prices, particularly natural gas; - changes in interest rates or rates of inflation; - weather variations and other natural phenomena; - the timing and extent of changes in the supply of natural gas; - commercial bank and financial market conditions, our access to capital, the cost of such capital, and the results of our financing and refinancing efforts, including availability of funds in the debt capital markets; - actions by rating agencies; - effectiveness of our risk management activities; - inability of various counterparties to meet their obligations to us; - non-payment for our services due to financial distress of our customers, including Reliant Energy, Inc. (RRI); - the ability of RRI to satisfy its obligations to us, including indemnity obligations; - our ability to control costs; - the investment performance of our employee benefit plans; - our potential business strategies, including acquisitions or dispositions of assets or businesses, which we cannot assure will provide the anticipated benefits to us; and - other factors we discuss under "Risk Factors" in Item 1A of this report. 37 <PAGE> CONSOLIDATED RESULTS OF OPERATIONS All dollar amounts in the tables that follow are in millions, except for per share amounts. <Table> <Caption> YEAR ENDED DECEMBER 31, ------------------------ 2003 2004 2005 ------ ------ ------ <S> <C> <C> <C> Revenues.................................................... $7,790 $7,999 $9,722 Expenses.................................................... 6,435 7,135 8,783 ------ ------ ------ Operating Income............................................ 1,355 864 939 Gain (Loss) on Time Warner Investment....................... 106 31 (44) Gain (Loss) on Indexed Debt Securities......................

We reported income from continuing operations before extraordinary item of $225 million ($0.67 per diluted share) for 2005 as compared to $205 million ($0.61 per diluted share) for 2004. The increase in income from continuing operations of $20 million was primarily due to increased operating income of $55 million in our Pipelines and Field Services business segment resulting from increased demand for transportation resulting from basis differentials across the system and higher demand for ancillary services as well as increased throughput and demand for services related to our core gas gathering operations, increased operating income of $16 million in our Competitive Natural Gas Sales and Services business segment primarily due to higher sales to utilities and favorable basis differentials over the pipeline capacity that we control, a decrease in the operating loss of $14 million in our Other Operations business segment resulting from increased overhead allocated in 2005 and a $67 million decrease in interest expense due to lower borrowing levels and lower borrowing costs reflecting the replacement of certain of our credit facilities. The above increases were partially offset by a decrease of $105 million in the return on the true-up 38 <PAGE> balance of our Electric Transmission & Distribution business segment as a result of the True-Up Order, partially offset by an increase in operating income of $21 million related to the return on the true-up balance being recovered through the CTC, and decreased operating income of $29 million in our Electric Transmission & Distribution business segment, excluding the CTC operating income discussed above, primarily from increased franchise fees paid to the City of Houston, increased depreciation expense and higher operation and maintenance expenses, including higher transmission costs, the absence of a $15 million partial reversal of a reserve related to the final fuel reconciliation recorded in the second quarter of 2004 and the absence of an $11 million gain from a land sale recorded in 2004, partially offset by increased usage mainly due to weather, continued customer growth and higher transmission cost recovery. Additionally, income tax expense increased $14 million in 2005 as compared to 2004. Net income for 2005 included an after-tax extraordinary gain of $30 million ($0.09 per diluted share) recorded in the second quarter reflecting an adjustment to the after-tax extraordinary loss of $977 million recorded in the last half of 2004 to write down generation-related regulatory assets as a result of the final orders issued by the Texas Utility Commission. Income Tax Expense. In 2005, our effective tax rate was 40.6%. The most significant items affecting our effective tax rate in 2005 were an addition to the tax reserve of approximately $42 million relating to the contention of the Internal Revenue Service (IRS) that the current deductions for original issue discount (OID) on our 2.0% Zero-Premium Exchangeable Subordinated Notes due 2029 (ZENS) be capitalized, potentially converting what would be ordinary deductions into capital losses at the time the ZENS are settled, partially offset by favorable tax audit adjustments of $10 million. Future changes to the reserve will depend upon a number of variables, including the market price of TW Common, the amount of ZENS OID, which increases quarterly, our assessment of available capital gains and the ultimate outcome of the dispute with the IRS. 2004 COMPARED TO 2003 Income from Continuing Operations. We reported income from continuing operations before extraordinary loss of $205 million ($0.61 per diluted share) for 2004 as compared to $409 million ($1.24 per diluted share) for 2003. The decrease in income from continuing operations of $204 million was primarily due to the termination of revenues in our Electric Transmission & Distribution business segment related to ECOM as of January 1, 2004, which had contributed $430 million of income in 2003, higher net transmission costs of $6 million related to our Electric Transmission & Distribution business segment and increased interest expense of $36 million related to continuing operations as discussed below. These items were partially offset by the absence of an $87 million reserve recorded in 2003 by our Electric Transmission & Distribution business segment related to the final fuel reconciliation, a $15 million reversal of this reserve in 2004 and $226 million of the return on the true-up balance of our Electric Transmission & Distribution business segment. These items were a result of the Texas Utility Commission's final orders in the final fuel reconciliation and the 2004 True-Up Proceeding. Additionally, income from continuing operations was favorably impacted by increased operating income of $31 million related to customer growth in our Electric Transmission & Distribution business segment, increased operating income of $21 million in our Natural Gas Distribution business segment primarily due to rate increases, increased operating income of $22 million in our Pipelines and Field Services business segment primarily from increased throughput, favorable commodity prices and increased ancillary services, and a gain of $11 million on the sale of land by our Electric Transmission & Distribution business segment. Net loss for 2004 included an after-tax extraordinary loss of $977 million ($2.72 per diluted share) from a write-down of regulatory assets based on our analysis of the Texas Utility Commission's final order in the 2004 True-Up Proceeding. Additionally, net loss for 2004 included a net after-tax loss from discontinued operations of Texas Genco of $133 million ($0.37 per diluted share). Net income for 2003 included the cumulative effect of an accounting change resulting from the adoption of SFAS No. 143, "Accounting for Asset Retirement Obligations" ($80 million after-tax gain, or $0.24 earnings per diluted share), which is included in discontinued operations related to Texas Genco. 39 <PAGE> INTEREST EXPENSE AND OTHER FINANCE CHARGES In 2003, our $3.85 billion credit facility consisted of a revolver and a term loan. This facility was amended in October 2003 to a $2.35 billion credit facility, consisting of a revolver and a term loan. According to the terms of the $3.85 billion credit facility, any net cash proceeds received from the sale of Texas Genco were required to be applied to repay borrowings under the credit facility. According to the terms of the $2.35 billion credit facility, until such time as the facility had been reduced to $750 million, 100% of any net cash proceeds received from the sale of Texas Genco were required to be applied to repay borrowings under the credit facility and reduce the amount available under the credit facility. In the fourth quarter of 2004, we reduced borrowings under our credit facility by $1.574 billion and retired $375 million of trust preferred securities. We expensed $15 million of unamortized loan costs in the fourth quarter of 2004 that were associated with the credit facility. In accordance with EITF Issue No. 87-24 "Allocation of Interest to Discontinued Operations", we have reclassified interest to discontinued operations of Texas Genco based on net proceeds received from the sale of Texas Genco of $2.5 billion, and have applied the proceeds to the amount of debt assumed to be paid down in each respective period according to the terms of the respective credit facilities in effect for those periods. In periods where only the term loan was assumed to be repaid, the actual interest paid on the term loan was reclassified. In periods where a portion of the revolver was assumed to be repaid, the percentage of that portion of the revolver to the total outstanding balance was calculated, and that percentage was applied to the actual interest paid in those periods to compute the amount of interest reclassified. Total interest expense incurred was $942 million, $849 million and $711 million in 2003, 2004 and 2005, respectively. We have reclassified $201 million, $72 million and $1 million of interest expense in 2003, 2004 and 2005, respectively, based upon actual interest expense incurred within our discontinued operations and interest expense associated with debt that would have been required to be repaid as a result of our disposition of Texas Genco. RESULTS OF OPERATIONS BY BUSINESS SEGMENT Revenues by segment include intersegment sales, which are eliminated in consolidation. The following table presents operating income (in millions) for each of our business segments for 2003, 2004 and 2005. Some amounts from the previous years have been reclassified to conform to the 2005 presentation of the financial statements. These reclassifications do not affect consolidated operating income.

In 2004 and 2005, there were no ECOM revenues. (2) Represents the amount necessary to pay interest on the transition bonds. 2005 Compared to 2004. Our Electric Transmission & Distribution business segment reported operating income of $487 million for 2005, consisting of $448 million for the regulated electric transmission and distribution utility and $39 million for the transition bond company subsidiaries of CenterPoint Houston that issued $749 million and $1.851 billion principal amount of transition bonds in 2001 and 2005, respectively. For 2004, operating income totaled $494 million, consisting of $456 million for the regulated electric transmission and distribution utility and $38 million for the transition bond company. Operating revenues increased primarily due to increased usage resulting from warmer weather ($13 million), continued customer growth ($33 million) with the addition of 61,000 metered customers since December 2004, recovery of our 2004 true-up balance not covered by the transition bond financing order ($21 million) and higher transmission cost recovery ($13 million). The increase in operating revenues was more than offset by higher transmission costs ($24 million), the absence of a gain from a land sale recorded in 2004 ($11 million), the absence of a $15 million partial reversal of a reserve related to the final fuel reconciliation recorded in 2004, increased employee-related expenses ($20 million) and higher tree trimming expense ($6 million), partially offset by a decrease in pension expense ($14 million). Depreciation and amortization expense increased ($10 million) primarily as a result of higher plant balances. Taxes other than income taxes increased ($11 million) primarily due to higher franchise fees paid to the City of Houston. In September 2005, CenterPoint Houston's service area in Texas was adversely affected by Hurricane Rita. Although damage to CenterPoint Houston's electric facilities was limited, over 700,000 customers lost 41 <PAGE> power at the height of the storm. Power was restored to over a half million customers within 36 hours and all power was restored in less than five days. The Electric Transmission & Distribution business segment's revenues lost as a result of the storm were more than offset by warmer than normal weather during the third quarter. CenterPoint Houston has deferred $28 million of restoration costs for recovery in a future rate case and has capitalized an additional $8 million of costs as property, plant and equipment. 2004 Compared to 2003. Our Electric Transmission & Distribution business segment reported operating income of $494 million for 2004, consisting of $456 million for the regulated electric transmission and distribution utility and $38 million for the transition bond company. For 2003, operating income totaled $1.0 billion, consisting of $321 million for the regulated electric transmission and distribution utility, $38 million for the transition bond company and $661 million of non-cash income associated with ECOM. Operating income increased $31 million from continued customer growth and a $11 million gain on a land sale, partially offset by milder weather and decreased usage of $18 million and higher net transmission costs of $6 million. Additionally, operating income in 2004 was favorably impacted by the absence of $87 million reserve recorded in 2003 related to the final fuel reconciliation and a $15 million partial reversal of this fuel reserve in 2004 as a result of the Texas Utility Commission's final orders in the final fuel reconciliation. NATURAL GAS DISTRIBUTION The following table provides summary data of our Natural Gas Distribution business segment for 2003, 2004 and 2005 (in millions, except throughput and customer data): <Table> <Caption> YEAR ENDED DECEMBER 31, --------------------------------- 2003 2004 2005 --------- --------- --------- <S> <C> <C> <C> Revenues............................................ $ 3,389 $ 3,579 $ 3,846 --------- --------- --------- Expenses: Natural gas....................................... 2,450 2,596 2,841 Operation and maintenance......................... 540 544 551 Depreciation and amortization..................... 135 141 152 Taxes other than income taxes..................... 107 120 127 --------- --------- --------- Total expenses................................. 3,232 3,401 3,671 --------- --------- --------- Operating Income.................................... $ 157 $ 178 $ 175 ========= ========= ========= Throughput (in billion cubic feet (Bcf)): Residential....................................... 183 175 160 Commercial and industrial......................... 238 237 215 --------- --------- --------- Total Throughput............................... 421 412 375 ========= ========= ========= Average number of customers: Residential.................................... 2,755,200 2,798,210 2,838,357 Commercial and industrial...................... 245,081 246,068 246,372 --------- --------- --------- Total.......................................... 3,000,281 3,044,278 3,084,729 ========= ========= ========= </Table> 2005 Compared to 2004. Our Natural Gas Distribution business segment reported operating income of $175 million for 2005 as compared to $178 million for 2004. Increases in operating margins (revenues less natural gas costs) from rate increases ($19 million) and margin from gas exchanges ($7 million) were partially offset by the impact of milder weather and decreased throughput net of continued customer growth with the addition of approximately 44,000 customers since December 2004 ($13 million). Operation and maintenance expense increased $7 million. Excluding an $8 million charge recorded in 2004 for severance costs associated with staff reductions, operation and maintenance expenses increased by $15 million primarily due to increased litigation reserves ($11 million) and increased bad debt expense ($9 million), partially offset by the capitalization of previously incurred restructuring expenses as allowed by a regulatory order from the 42 <PAGE> Railroad Commission of Texas ($5 million). Additionally, operating income was unfavorably impacted by increased depreciation expense primarily due to higher plant balances ($11 million). During the third quarter of 2005, our east Texas, Louisiana and Mississippi natural gas service areas were affected by Hurricanes Katrina and Rita. Damage to our facilities was limited, but approximately 10,000 homes and businesses were damaged to such an extent that they will not be taking service for the foreseeable future. The impact on the Natural Gas Distribution business segment's operating income was not material. 2004 Compared to 2003. Our Natural Gas Distribution business segment reported operating income of $178 million for 2004 as compared to $157 million for 2003. Increases in operating income of $4 million from continued customer growth with the addition of 45,000 customers since December 31, 2003, $15 million from rate increases, $11 million from the impact of the 2003 change in estimate of margins earned on unbilled revenues implemented in 2003 and $9 million related to certain regulatory adjustments made to the amount of recoverable gas costs in 2003 were partially offset by the $8 million impact of milder weather. Operations and maintenance expense increased $4 million for 2004 as compared to 2003. Excluding an $8 million charge recorded in the first quarter of 2004 for severance costs associated with staff reductions, which has reduced costs in later periods, operation and maintenance expenses decreased by $4 million. COMPETITIVE NATURAL GAS SALES AND SERVICES The following table provides summary data of our Competitive Natural Gas Sales and Services business segment for 2003, 2004 and 2005 (in millions, except throughput and customer data): <Table> <Caption> YEAR ENDED DECEMBER 31, ------------------------ 2003 2004 2005 ------ ------ ------ <S> <C> <C> <C> Revenues................................................... $2,232 $2,848 $4,129 ------ ------ ------ Expenses: Natural gas.............................................. 2,164 2,778 4,033 Operation and maintenance................................ 20 22 30 Depreciation and amortization............................ 1 2 2 Taxes other than income taxes............................ 2 2 4 ------ ------ ------ Total expenses........................................ 2,187 2,804 4,069 ------ ------ ------ Operating Income........................................... $ 45 $ 44 $ 60 ====== ====== ====== Throughput (in Bcf): Wholesale -- third parties............................... 195 228 304 Wholesale -- affiliates.................................. 21 35 27 Retail................................................... 140 141 156 Pipeline................................................. 80 76 51 ------ ------ ------ Total Throughput...................................... 436 480 538 ====== ====== ====== Average number of customers: Wholesale................................................ 73 97 138 Retail................................................... 5,242 5,976 6,328 Pipeline................................................. 188 172 142 ------ ------ ------ Total................................................. 5,503 6,245 6,608 ====== ====== ====== </Table> 2005 Compared to 2004. Our Competitive Natural Gas Sales and Services business segment reported operating income of $60 million for 2005 as compared to $44 million for 2004. The increase in operating income of $16 million was primarily due to increased operating margins (revenues less natural gas costs) related to higher sales to utilities and favorable basis differentials over the pipeline capacity that we control 43 <PAGE> ($32 million) less the impact of certain derivative transactions ($6 million), partially offset by higher payroll and benefit related expenses ($4 million) and increased bad debt expense ($3 million). 2004 Compared to 2003. Our Competitive Natural Gas Sales and Services business segment reported operating income of $44 million for 2004 as compared to $45 million for 2003. The decrease in operating income was primarily due to increased payroll and benefit-related expenses ($3 million), increased factoring expenses ($1 million) and increased franchise taxes ($1 million), partially offset by increased operating margins related to increased volatility and growth ($2 million) and a decrease in bad debt expense ($2 million). PIPELINES AND FIELD SERVICES The following table provides summary data of our Pipelines and Field Services business segment for 2003, 2004 and 2005 (in millions, except throughput data): <Table> <Caption> YEAR ENDED DECEMBER 31, ------------------------ 2003 2004 2005 ------ ------ ------ <S> <C> <C> <C> Revenues................................................... $ 407 $ 451 $ 493 ------ ------ ------ Expenses: Natural gas.............................................. 61 46 30 Operation and maintenance................................ 129 164 164 Depreciation and amortization............................ 40 44 45 Taxes other than income taxes............................ 19 17 19 ------ ------ ------ Total expenses........................................ 249 271 258 ------ ------ ------ Operating Income........................................... $ 158 $ 180 $ 235 ====== ====== ====== Throughput (in Bcf): Natural gas sales........................................ 9 11 6 Transportation........................................... 794 859 914 Gathering................................................ 292 321 353 Elimination(1)...........................................

Our Pipelines and Field Services business segment reported operating income of $235 million for 2005 compared to $180 million for 2004. Operating income for the pipeline business for 2005 was $165 million compared to $129 million in 2004. The field services business recorded operating income of $70 million for 2005 compared to $51 million in 2004. Operating margins (revenues less natural gas costs) increased by $58 million primarily due to increased demand for transportation resulting from basis differentials across the system and higher demand for ancillary services ($43 million), increased throughput and demand for services related to our core gas gathering operations ($29 million), partially offset by reductions in project-related revenues ($11 million). Additionally, operation and maintenance expenses remained flat primarily due to a reduction in project-related expenses ($9 million), offset by increases in materials and supplies and contracts and services ($8 million). 2004 Compared to 2003. Our Pipelines and Field Services business segment's operating income increased by $22 million in 2004 compared to 2003. Operating margins (revenues less fuel costs) increased by $59 million primarily due to favorable commodity pricing ($3 million), increased demand for certain transportation services driven by commodity price volatility ($36 million) and increased throughput and enhanced services related to our core gas gathering operations ($11 million). The increase in operating margin was partially offset by higher operation and maintenance expenses of $35 million primarily due to compliance 44 <PAGE> with pipeline integrity regulations ($4 million) and costs relating to environmental matters ($9 million). Project work expenses included in operation and maintenance expense increased ($11 million) resulting in a corresponding increase in revenues billed for these services ($15 million). Additionally, included in other income in 2003, 2004 and 2005 is equity income of $-0-, $2 million and $6 million, respectively, related to a joint venture owned by our field services business. OTHER OPERATIONS The following table provides summary data for our Other Operations business segment for 2003, 2004 and 2005 (in millions): <Table> <Caption> YEAR ENDED DECEMBER 31, ------------------------ 2003 2004 2005 ------ ------ ------ <S> <C> <C> <C> Revenues.................................................... $ 28 $ 8 $ 19 Expenses.................................................... 53 40 37 ---- ---- ---- Operating Loss.............................................. $(25) $(32) $(18) ==== ==== ==== </Table> 2005 Compared to 2004. Our Other Operations business segment's operating loss in 2005 compared to 2004 decreased $14 million primarily due to increased overhead allocated in 2005. 2004 Compared to 2003. Our Other Operations business segment's operating loss in 2004 compared to 2003 increased $7 million primarily due to a reduction in rental income from Reliant Energy, Inc. (RRI) in 2004 as compared to 2003, partially offset by changes in unallocated corporate costs in 2004 as compared to 2003. DISCONTINUED OPERATIONS In February 2003, we sold our interest in Argener, a cogeneration facility in Argentina, for $23 million. The carrying value of this investment was approximately $11 million as of December 31, 2002. We recorded an after-tax gain of $7 million from the sale of Argener in the first quarter of 2003. In April 2003, we sold our final remaining investment in Argentina, a 90 percent interest in Empresa Distribuidora de Electricidad de Santiago del Estero S.A. We recorded an after-tax loss of $3 million in the second quarter of 2003 related to our Latin America operations. We have completed our strategy of exiting all of our international investments. In November 2003, we sold CenterPoint Energy Management Services, Inc. (CEMS), a business that provides district cooling services in the Houston central business district and related complementary energy services to district cooling customers and others. We recorded an after-tax loss of $1 million from the sale of CEMS in the fourth quarter of 2003. We recorded an after-tax loss in discontinued operations of $16 million ($25 million pre-tax) during the second quarter of 2003 to record the impairment of the CEMS long-lived assets based on the impending sale and to record one-time employee termination benefits. In July 2004, we announced our agreement to sell our majority owned subsidiary, Texas Genco, to Texas Genco LLC. On December 15, 2004, Texas Genco completed the sale of its fossil generation assets (coal, lignite and gas-fired plants) to Texas Genco LLC for $2.813 billion in cash. Following the sale, Texas Genco, whose principal remaining asset was its ownership interest in a nuclear generating facility, distributed $2.231 billion in cash to us. The final step of the transaction, the merger of Texas Genco with a subsidiary of Texas Genco LLC in exchange for an additional cash payment to us of $700 million, was completed on April 13, 2005. We recorded an after-tax gain (loss) of $91 million, $(133) million and $(3) million for the years ended December 31, 2003, 2004 and 2005, respectively, related to the operations of Texas Genco. The consolidated financial statements report the businesses described above as discontinued operations for all periods presented in accordance with Statement of Financial Accounting Standards (SFAS) No. 144, "Accounting for the Impairment or Disposal of Long-Lived Assets" (SFAS No. 144). For further information regarding discontinued operations, please read Note 3 to our consolidated financial statements. 45 <PAGE> LIQUIDITY AND CAPITAL RESOURCES HISTORICAL CASH FLOW The net cash provided by/used in operating, investing and financing activities for 2003, 2004 and 2005 is as follows (in millions): <Table> <Caption> YEAR ENDED DECEMBER 31, ----------------------- 2003 2004 2005 ----- ------- ----- <S> <C> <C> <C> Cash provided by (used in): Operating activities..................................... $ 894 $ 736 $ 63 Investing activities..................................... (661) 1,466 17 Financing activities..................................... (450) (2,124) (171) </Table> CASH PROVIDED BY OPERATING ACTIVITIES Net cash provided by operating activities in 2005 decreased $673 million compared to 2004 primarily due to increased tax payments of $475 million, the majority of which related to the tax payment in the second quarter of 2005 associated with the sale of Texas Genco, decreased cash provided by Texas Genco of $393 million, increased net accounts receivable/payable ($151 million), increased gas storage inventory ($105 million) and increased fuel under-recovery ($154 million), primarily due to higher gas prices in 2005 as compared to 2004. These decreases were partially offset by decreases in net regulatory assets/liabilities ($328 million), primarily due to the termination of excess mitigation credits effective April 29, 2005, and decreased pension contributions of $401 million in 2005 as compared to 2004. Net cash provided by operating activities in 2004 decreased $158 million compared to 2003 primarily due to increased pension contributions of $453 million and decreased income tax refunds of $74 million, partially offset by the receipt of a $177 million retail clawback payment from RRI in the fourth quarter of 2004, decreased accounts receivable attributable to a higher level of accounts receivable being sold under CERC Corp.'s receivables facility ($81 million) and increased cash provided by Texas Genco's operations ($110 million). Additionally, other changes in working capital items, primarily increased net accounts receivable and accounts payable due to higher natural gas prices in December 2004 as compared to December 2003 ($99 million), contributed to the overall decrease in cash provided by operating activities. CASH PROVIDED BY (USED IN) INVESTING ACTIVITIES Net cash provided by investing activities decreased $1.4 billion in 2005 as compared to 2004 primarily due to proceeds of $700 million received from the sale of our remaining interest in Texas Genco in April 2005 compared to proceeds of $2.947 billion received in 2004 from the sale of Texas Genco's fossil generation assets and increased capital expenditures of $89 million, partially offset by the purchase of the minority interest in Texas Genco in 2004 of $716 million and cash collateralization of letters of credit by Texas Genco in 2004 related to its anticipated purchase of an additional interest in the South Texas Project in the first half of 2005 of $191 million. Net cash provided by investing activities increased $2.1 billion in 2004 as compared to 2003 primarily due to proceeds of $2.947 billion received from the sale of Texas Genco's fossil generation assets in December 2004, offset by the purchase of the minority interest in Texas Genco in December 2004 ($716 million) and cash collateralization of letters of credit by Texas Genco related to its anticipated purchase of an additional interest in the South Texas Project in the first half of 2005 ($191 million). CASH USED IN FINANCING ACTIVITIES In 2005, debt payments exceeded net loan proceeds by $66 million. Proceeds from the December 2005 issuance of $1.85 billion in transition bonds were used to repay borrowings under our credit facility and CenterPoint Houston's $1.3 billion term loan. 46 <PAGE> In 2004, debt payments exceeded net loan proceeds by $2.0 billion. Proceeds received from the sale of Texas Genco's fossil generation assets in December 2004 and the retail clawback payment from RRI as discussed above were used to retire a $915 million term loan, pay down $944 million in borrowings under our revolving credit facility and retire $375 million of trust preferred securities. As of December 31, 2004, we had borrowings of $239 million under our revolving credit facility which were used to fund a portion of the $420 million pension contribution made in December 2004. FUTURE SOURCES AND USES OF CASH Our liquidity and capital requirements are affected primarily by our results of operations, capital expenditures, debt service requirements, tax payments, working capital needs, various regulatory actions and appeals relating to such regulatory actions. Our principal cash requirements for 2006 include the following: - approximately $1 billion of capital expenditures, including the construction of a new pipeline by our Pipelines and Field Services business segment ($343 million) and transmission project by our Electric Transmission & Distribution business segment ($60 million); - dividend payments on CenterPoint Energy common stock and debt service payments; and - long-term debt payments of $224 million, including $73 million of transition bonds. We expect that borrowings under our credit facilities and anticipated cash flows from operations will be sufficient to meet our cash needs for the next twelve months. Cash needs may also be met by issuing securities in the capital markets. The following table sets forth our capital expenditures for 2005 excluding capital expenditures of $9 million related to discontinued operations, and estimates of our capital requirements for 2006 through 2010 (in millions): <Table> <Caption> 2005 2006 2007 2008 2009 2010 ---- ------ ---- ---- ---- ---- <S> <C> <C> <C> <C> <C> <C> Electric Transmission & Distribution............. $281 $ 336 $361 $333 $304 $301 Natural Gas Distribution......................... 249 191 253 264 251 218 Competitive Natural Gas Sales and Services....... 12 10 2 1 1 1 Pipelines and Field Services..................... 156 467 257 118 110 65 Other Operations................................. 21 20 28 19 11 9 ---- ------ ---- ---- ---- ---- Total.......................................... $719 $1,024 $901 $735 $677 $594 ==== ====== ==== ==== ==== ==== </Table> The following table sets forth estimates of our contractual obligations, including payments due by period (in millions): <Table> <Caption> 2011 AND CONTRACTUAL OBLIGATIONS TOTAL 2006 2007-2008 2009-2010 THEREAFTER - ----------------------- ------- ------ --------- --------- ---------- <S> <C> <C> <C> <C> <C> Transition bond debt, including current portion(1)................................. $ 2,480 $ 73 $ 306 $ 365 $ 1,736 Other long-term debt, including current portion.................................... 6,423 263 513 216 5,431 Interest payments -- transition bond debt(1)(2)................................. 960 92 239 207 422 Interest payments -- other long-term debt(2).................................... 4,861 408 774 724 2,955 Capital leases............................... 4 3 -- -- 1 Operating leases(3).......................... 85 20 32 11 22 Benefit obligations(4)....................... -- -- -- -- -- Purchase obligations(5)...................... 109 109 -- -- -- Non-trading derivative liabilities........... 78 43 20 12 3 Other commodity commitments(6)............... 1,316 858 428 7 23 ------- ------ ------ ------ ------- Total contractual cash obligations......... $16,316 $1,869 $2,312 $1,542 $10,593 ======= ====== ====== ====== ======= </Table> 47 <PAGE> - --------------- (1) Transition charges are adjusted at least annually to cover debt service on transition bonds. (2) We calculated estimated interest payments for long-term debt as follows: for fixed-rate debt and term debt, we calculated interest based on the applicable rates and payment dates; for variable-rate debt and/or non-term debt, we used interest rates in place as of December 31, 2005; we typically expect to settle such interest payments with cash flows from operations and short-term borrowings. (3) For a discussion of operating leases, please read Note 10(b) to our consolidated financial statements. (4) Contributions to the pension plan are not required in 2006; however, we expect to contribute approximately $26 million to our postretirement benefits plan in 2006 to fund a portion of our obligations in accordance with rate orders or to fund pay-as-you-go costs associated with the plan. (5) Represents capital commitments for material in connection with the construction of a new pipeline by our Pipelines and Field Services business segment. This project has been included in the table of capital expenditures presented above. (6) For a discussion of other commodity commitments, please read Note 10(a) to our consolidated financial statements. Off-Balance Sheet Arrangements. Other than operating leases, we have no off-balance sheet arrangements. However, we do participate in a receivables factoring arrangement. CERC Corp. has a bankruptcy remote subsidiary, which we consolidate, which was formed for the sole purpose of buying receivables created by CERC and selling those receivables to an unrelated third-party. This transaction is accounted for as a sale of receivables under the provisions of SFAS No. 140, "Accounting for Transfers and Servicing of Financial Assets and Extinguishments of Liabilities," and, as a result, the related receivables are excluded from the Consolidated Balance Sheet. In January 2006, the $250 million facility, which temporarily increased to $375 million for the period from January 2006 to June 2006, was extended to January 2007. As of December 31, 2005, CERC had $141 million of advances under its receivables facility. Prior to CenterPoint Energy's distribution of its ownership in RRI to its shareholders, CERC had guaranteed certain contractual obligations of what became RRI's trading subsidiary. Under the terms of the separation agreement between the companies, RRI agreed to extinguish all such guarantee obligations prior to separation, but when separation occurred in September 2002, RRI had been unable to extinguish all obligations. To secure CenterPoint Energy and CERC against obligations under the remaining guarantees, RRI agreed to provide cash or letters of credit for the benefit of CERC and CenterPoint Energy, and undertook to use commercially reasonable efforts to extinguish the remaining guarantees. Our current exposure under the remaining guarantees relates to CERC's guarantee of the payment by RRI of demand charges related to transportation contracts with one counterparty. The demand charges are approximately $53 million per year in 2006 through 2015, $49 million in 2016, $38 million in 2017 and $13 million in 2018. As a result of changes in market conditions, CenterPoint Energy's potential exposure under that guarantee currently exceeds the security provided by RRI. CenterPoint Energy has requested RRI to increase the amount of its existing letters of credit or, in the alternative, to obtain a release of CERC's obligations under the guarantee, and CenterPoint Energy and RRI are pursuing alternatives. RRI continues to meet its obligations under the transportation contracts. Credit Facilities. In June 2005, CERC Corp. replaced its $250 million three-year revolving credit facility with a $400 million five-year revolving credit facility. Borrowings under this facility may be made at LIBOR plus 55 basis points, including the facility fee, based on current credit ratings. An additional utilization fee of 10 basis points applies to borrowings whenever more than 50% of the facility is utilized. Changes in credit ratings could lower or raise the increment to LIBOR depending on whether ratings improved or were lowered. CERC Corp.'s $400 million credit facility contains covenants, including a total debt to capitalization covenant of 65% and an earnings before interest, taxes, depreciation and amortization (EBITDA) to interest covenant. Borrowings under CERC Corp.'s $400 million credit facility are available notwithstanding that a material adverse change has occurred or litigation that could be expected to have a material adverse effect has occurred, so long as other customary terms and conditions are satisfied. 48 <PAGE> In March 2005, we replaced our $750 million revolving credit facility with a $1 billion five-year revolving credit facility. Borrowings may be made under the facility at LIBOR plus 87.5 basis points based on current credit ratings. An additional utilization fee of 12.5 basis points applies to borrowings whenever more than 50% of the facility is utilized. Changes in credit ratings could lower or raise the increment to LIBOR depending on whether ratings improved or were lowered. The facility contains covenants, including a debt to EBITDA covenant and an EBITDA to interest covenant. Borrowings under our credit facility are available upon customary terms and conditions for facilities of this type, including a requirement that we represent, except as described below, that no "material adverse change" has occurred at the time of a new borrowing under this facility. A "material adverse change" is defined as the occurrence of a material adverse change in our ability to perform our obligations under the facility but excludes any litigation related to the True-Up Order. The base line for any determination of a relative material adverse change is our most recently audited financial statements. At any time after the first time our credit ratings reach at least BBB by Standard & Poor's Ratings Services, a division of The McGraw Hill Companies (S&P), and Baa2 by Moody's Investors Service, Inc. (Moody's), BBB+ by S&P and Baa3 by Moody's, or BBB- by S&P and Baa1 by Moody's, or if the drawing is to retire maturing commercial paper, we are not required to represent as a condition to such drawing that no material adverse change has occurred or that no litigation expected to have a material adverse effect has occurred. Also in March 2005, CenterPoint Houston established a $200 million five-year revolving credit facility. Borrowings may be made under the facility at LIBOR plus 75 basis points based on CenterPoint Houston's current credit ratings. An additional utilization fee of 12.5 basis points applies to borrowings whenever more than 50% of the facility is utilized. Changes in credit ratings could lower or raise the increment to LIBOR depending on whether ratings improved or were lowered. CenterPoint Houston's $200 million credit facility contains covenants, including a debt (excluding transition bonds) to total capitalization covenant of 68% and an EBITDA to interest covenant. Borrowings under CenterPoint Houston's $200 million credit facility are available notwithstanding that a material adverse change has occurred or litigation that could be expected to have a material adverse effect has occurred, so long as other customary terms and conditions are satisfied. We, CenterPoint Houston and CERC Corp. are currently in compliance with the various business and financial covenants contained in the respective credit facilities. As of February 28, 2006, we had the following credit facilities (in millions): <Table> <Caption> AMOUNT UTILIZED AT DATE EXECUTED COMPANY SIZE OF FACILITY FEBRUARY 28, 2006 TERMINATION DATE - ------------- ------- ---------------- ------------------ ---------------- <S> <C> <C> <C> <C> March 7, 2005 CenterPoint Energy $1,000 $96(1) March 7, 2010 March 7, 2005 CenterPoint Houston 200 4(2) March 7, 2010 June 30, 2005 CERC Corp. 400 -- June 30, 2010 </Table> - --------------- (1) Includes $28 million of outstanding letters of credit and $68 million of commercial paper backstopped by the credit facility. (2) Represents $4 million of outstanding letters of credit. The $1 billion CenterPoint Energy credit facility backstops a $1 billion commercial paper program under which CenterPoint Energy began issuing commercial paper in June 2005. As of December 31, 2005, $3 million of commercial paper was outstanding. The commercial paper is rated "Not Prime" by Moody's, "A-3" by S&P and "F3" by Fitch, Inc. (Fitch) and, as a result, we do not expect to be able to rely on the sale of commercial paper to fund all of our short-term borrowing requirements. We cannot assure you that these ratings, or the credit ratings set forth below in "-- Impact on Liquidity of a Downgrade in Credit Ratings," will remain in effect for any given period of time or that one or more of these ratings will not be lowered or withdrawn entirely by a rating agency. We note that these credit ratings are not recommendations to buy, sell or hold our securities and may be revised or withdrawn at any time by the rating agency. Each rating should be evaluated independently of any other rating. Any future reduction or withdrawal of one or more of our credit 49 <PAGE> ratings could have a material adverse impact on our ability to obtain short- and long-term financing, the cost of such financings and the execution of our commercial strategies. During the fourth quarter of 2005, CenterPoint Houston retired at maturity its $1.31 billion term loan, which bore interest at LIBOR plus 975 basis points, subject to a minimum LIBOR rate of 3 percent. It used its $1.31 billion credit facility bearing interest at LIBOR plus 75 basis points to retire the term loan. All amounts borrowed under the credit facility were repaid with a portion of the proceeds of the $1.85 billion transition bonds referred to above. Securities Registered with the SEC. At December 31, 2005, CenterPoint Energy had a shelf registration statement covering senior debt securities, preferred stock and common stock aggregating $1 billion and CERC Corp. had a shelf registration statement covering $500 million principal amount of debt securities. Temporary Investments. On December 31, 2005, we had no temporary investments. Money Pool. We have a "money pool" through which our participating subsidiaries can borrow or invest on a short-term basis. Funding needs are aggregated and external borrowing or investing is based on the net cash position. The net funding requirements of the money pool are expected to be met with borrowings under CenterPoint Energy's revolving credit facility or the sale of commercial paper. Impact on Liquidity of a Downgrade in Credit Ratings. As of February 28, 2006, Moody's, S&P, and Fitch had assigned the following credit ratings to senior debt of CenterPoint Energy and certain subsidiaries: <Table> <Caption> MOODY'S S&P FITCH ------------------- ------------------- ------------------- COMPANY/INSTRUMENT RATING OUTLOOK(1) RATING OUTLOOK(2) RATING OUTLOOK(3) - ------------------ ------ ---------- ------ ---------- ------ ---------- <S> <C> <C> <C> <C> <C> <C> CenterPoint Energy Senior Unsecured Debt............................. Ba1 Stable BBB- Stable BBB- Stable CenterPoint Houston Senior Secured Debt (First Mortgage Bonds)...... Baa2 Stable BBB Stable A- Stable CERC Corp. Senior Debt............. Baa3 Stable BBB Stable BBB Stable </Table> - --------------- (1) A "stable" outlook from Moody's indicates that Moody's does not expect to put the rating on review for an upgrade or downgrade within 18 months from when the outlook was assigned or last affirmed. (2) An S&P rating outlook assesses the potential direction of a long-term credit rating over the intermediate to longer term. (3) A "stable" outlook from Fitch encompasses a one-to-two-year horizon as to the likely ratings direction. A decline in credit ratings could increase borrowing costs under our $1 billion credit facility, CenterPoint Houston's $200 million credit facility and CERC's $400 million revolving credit facility. A decline in credit ratings would also increase the interest rate on long-term debt to be issued in the capital markets and could negatively impact our ability to complete capital market transactions. Additionally, a decline in credit ratings could increase cash collateral requirements and reduce margins of our Natural Gas Distribution and Competitive Natural Gas Sales and Services business segments. As described above under "-- Credit Facilities," our revolving credit facility contains a "material adverse change" clause that could impact our ability to make new borrowings under this facility. CenterPoint Houston's $200 million credit facility and CERC Corp.'s $400 million credit facility do not contain material adverse change clauses with respect to borrowings. In September 1999, we issued 2.0% Zero-Premium Exchangeable Subordinated Notes due 2029 (ZENS) having an original principal amount of $1.0 billion. Each ZENS note is exchangeable at the holder's option at any time for an amount of cash equal to 95% of the market value of the reference shares of Time Warner Inc. (TW Common) attributable to each ZENS note. If our creditworthiness were to drop such that ZENS note holders thought our liquidity was adversely affected or the market for the ZENS notes were to become illiquid, some ZENS note holders might decide to exchange their ZENS notes for cash. Funds for the payment of cash upon exchange could be obtained from the sale of the shares of TW Common that we own or 50 <PAGE> from other sources. We own shares of TW Common equal to 100% of the reference shares used to calculate our obligation to the holders of the ZENS notes. ZENS note exchanges result in a cash outflow because deferred tax liabilities related to the ZENS notes and TW Common shares become current tax obligations when ZENS notes are exchanged and TW Common shares are sold. CES, a wholly owned subsidiary of CERC Corp. operating in our Competitive Natural Gas Sales and Services business segment, provides comprehensive natural gas sales and services primarily to commercial and industrial customers and electric and gas utilities throughout the central and eastern United States. In order to hedge its exposure to natural gas prices, CES uses financial derivatives with provisions standard for the industry that establish credit thresholds and require a party to provide additional collateral on two business days' notice when that party's rating or the rating of a credit support provider for that party (CERC Corp. in this case) falls below those levels. We estimate that as of December 31, 2005, unsecured credit limits extended to CES by counterparties aggregate $128 million; however, utilized credit capacity is significantly lower. In addition, CERC and its subsidiaries purchase natural gas under supply agreements that contain an aggregate credit threshold of $100 million based on CERC's S&P Senior Unsecured Long-Term Debt rating of BBB. Upgrades and downgrades from this BBB rating will increase and decrease the aggregate credit threshold accordingly. Cross Defaults. Under our revolving credit facility, a payment default on, or a non-payment default that permits acceleration of, any indebtedness exceeding $50 million by us or any of our significant subsidiaries will cause a default. Pursuant to the indenture governing our senior notes, a payment default by us, CERC Corp. or CenterPoint Houston in respect of, or an acceleration of, borrowed money and certain other specified types of obligations, in the aggregate principal amount of $50 million will cause a default. As of February 28, 2006, we had issued six series of senior notes aggregating $1.4 billion in principal amount under this indenture. A default by CenterPoint Energy would not trigger a default under our subsidiaries' debt instruments or bank credit facilities. Other Factors that Could Affect Cash Requirements. In addition to the above factors, our liquidity and capital resources could be affected by: - cash collateral requirements that could exist in connection with certain contracts, including gas purchases, gas price hedging and gas storage activities of our Natural Gas Distribution and Competitive Natural Gas Sales and Services business segments, particularly given gas price levels and volatility; - acceleration of payment dates on certain gas supply contracts under certain circumstances, as a result of increased gas prices and concentration of suppliers; - increased costs related to the acquisition of gas; - increases in interest expense in connection with debt refinancings and borrowings under credit facilities; - various regulatory actions; - the ability of RRI and its subsidiaries to satisfy their obligations as the principal customers of CenterPoint Houston and in respect of RRI's indemnity obligations to us and our subsidiaries; - slower customer payments and increased write-offs of receivables due to higher gas prices; - cash payments in connection with the exercise of contingent conversion rights of holders of convertible debt; - contributions to benefit plans; - restoration costs and revenue losses resulting from natural disasters such as hurricanes; and - various other risks identified in "Risk Factors" in Item 1A of this report. Certain Contractual Limits on Our Ability to Issue Securities, Borrow Money and Pay Dividends on Our Common Stock. CenterPoint Houston's credit facility limits CenterPoint Houston's debt, excluding transi- 51 <PAGE> tion bonds, as a percentage of its total capitalization to 68 percent. CenterPoint Houston's $200 million credit facility also contains an EBITDA to interest covenant. CERC Corp.'s bank facility and its receivables facility limit CERC's debt as a percentage of its total capitalization to 65 percent and contain an EBITDA to interest covenant. Our $1 billion credit facility contains a debt to EBITDA covenant and an EBITDA to interest covenant. Additionally, in connection with the issuance of a certain series of general mortgage bonds, CenterPoint Houston agreed not to issue, subject to certain exceptions, additional first mortgage bonds. We were a registered public utility holding company under the 1935 Act. The 1935 Act and related rules and regulations imposed a number of restrictions on our activities and those of our subsidiaries. The Energy Act repealed the 1935 Act effective February 8, 2006, and since that date we and our subsidiaries have no longer been subject to restrictions imposed under the 1935 Act. The Energy Act includes PUHCA 2005 which grants to the FERC authority to require holding companies and their subsidiaries to maintain certain books and records and make them available for review by the FERC and state regulatory authorities in certain circumstances. On December 8, 2005, the FERC issued rules implementing PUHCA 2005 that will require us to notify the FERC of our status as a holding company and to maintain certain books and records and make these available to the FERC. The FERC continues to consider motions for rehearing or clarification of these rules. CRITICAL ACCOUNTING POLICIES A critical accounting policy is one that is both important to the presentation of our financial condition and results of operations and requires management to make difficult, subjective or complex accounting estimates. An accounting estimate is an approximation made by management of a financial statement element, item or account in the financial statements. Accounting estimates in our historical consolidated financial statements measure the effects of past business transactions or events, or the present status of an asset or liability. The accounting estimates described below require us to make assumptions about matters that are highly uncertain at the time the estimate is made. Additionally, different estimates that we could have used or changes in an accounting estimate that are reasonably likely to occur could have a material impact on the presentation of our financial condition or results of operations. The circumstances that make these judgments difficult, subjective and/or complex have to do with the need to make estimates about the effect of matters that are inherently uncertain. Estimates and assumptions about future events and their effects cannot be predicted with certainty. We base our estimates on historical experience and on various other assumptions that we believe to be reasonable under the circumstances, the results of which form the basis for making judgments. These estimates may change as new events occur, as more experience is acquired, as additional information is obtained and as our operating environment changes. Our significant accounting policies are discussed in Note 2 to our consolidated financial statements. We believe the following accounting policies involve the application of critical accounting estimates. Accordingly, these accounting estimates have been reviewed and discussed with the audit committee of the board of directors. ACCOUNTING FOR RATE REGULATION SFAS No. 71, "Accounting for the Effects of Certain Types of Regulation" (SFAS No. 71), provides that rate-regulated entities account for and report assets and liabilities consistent with the recovery of those incurred costs in rates if the rates established are designed to recover the costs of providing the regulated service and if the competitive environment makes it probable that such rates can be charged and collected. Application of SFAS No. 71 to the electric generation portion of our business was discontinued as of June 30, 1999. Our Electric Transmission & Distribution business continues to apply SFAS No. 71 which results in our accounting for the regulatory effects of recovery of stranded costs and other regulatory assets resulting from the unbundling of the transmission and distribution business from our electric generation operations in our consolidated financial statements. Certain expenses and revenues subject to utility regulation or rate determination normally reflected in income are deferred on the balance sheet and are recognized in income as the related amounts are included in service rates and recovered from or refunded to customers. Significant accounting estimates embedded within the application of SFAS No. 71 with respect to our Electric Transmission & Distribution business segment relate to $332 million of recoverable electric generation-related 52 <PAGE> regulatory assets as of December 31, 2005. These costs are recoverable under the provisions of the Texas electric restructuring law. Based on our analysis of the True-Up Order, we recorded an after-tax charge to earnings in 2004 of approximately $977 million to write-down our electric generation-related regulatory assets to their realizable value, which was reflected as an extraordinary loss. Based on subsequent orders received from the Texas Utility Commission, we recorded an extraordinary gain of $30 million after-tax in the second quarter of 2005 related to the regulatory asset. Additionally, a district court in Travis County, Texas issued a judgment that would have the effect of restoring approximately $650 million, plus interest, of disallowed costs. Appeals of the district court's judgment are still pending. No amounts related to the court's judgment have been recorded in our consolidated financial statements. IMPAIRMENT OF LONG-LIVED ASSETS AND INTANGIBLES We review the carrying value of our long-lived assets, including goodwill and identifiable intangibles, whenever events or changes in circumstances indicate that such carrying values may not be recoverable, and at least annually for goodwill as required by SFAS No. 142, "Goodwill and Other Intangible Assets" (SFAS No. 142). Unforeseen events and changes in circumstances and market conditions and material differences in the value of long-lived assets and intangibles due to changes in estimates of future cash flows, regulatory matters and operating costs could negatively affect the fair value of our assets and result in an impairment charge. Fair value is the amount at which the asset could be bought or sold in a current transaction between willing parties and may be estimated using a number of techniques, including quoted market prices or valuations by third parties, present value techniques based on estimates of cash flows, or multiples of earnings or revenue performance measures. The fair value of the asset could be different using different estimates and assumptions in these valuation techniques. We perform our goodwill impairment test at least annually and evaluate goodwill when events or changes in circumstances indicate that the carrying value of these assets may not be recoverable. Upon adoption of SFAS No. 142, we initially selected January 1 as our annual goodwill impairment testing date. Since the time we selected the January 1 date, our year-end closing and reporting process has been truncated in order to meet the accelerated periodic reporting requirements of the SEC, resulting in significant constraints on our human resources at year-end and during our first fiscal quarter. Accordingly, in order to meet the accelerated reporting deadlines and to provide adequate time to complete the analysis each year, beginning in the third quarter of 2005, we changed the date on which we perform our annual goodwill impairment test from January 1 to July 1. We believe the July 1 alternative date will alleviate the resource constraints that exist during the first quarter and allow us to utilize additional resources in conducting the annual impairment evaluation of goodwill. We performed the test at July 1, 2005, and determined that no impairment charge for goodwill was required. The change is not intended to delay, accelerate or avoid an impairment charge. We believe that this accounting change is an alternative accounting principle that is preferable under the circumstances. ASSET RETIREMENT OBLIGATIONS We account for our long-lived assets under SFAS No. 143, "Accounting for Asset Retirement Obligations" (SFAS No. 143), and Financial Accounting Standards Board Interpretation No. 47, "Accounting for Conditional Asset Retirement Obligations -- An Interpretation of SFAS No. 143" (FIN 47). SFAS No. 143 and FIN 47 require that an asset retirement obligation be recorded at fair value in the period in which it is incurred if a reasonable estimate of fair value can be made. In the same period, the associated asset retirement costs are capitalized as part of the carrying amount of the related long-lived asset. Rate-regulated entities may recognize regulatory assets or liabilities as a result of timing differences between the recognition of costs as recorded in accordance with SFAS No. 143 and FIN 47, and costs recovered through the ratemaking process. 53 <PAGE> We estimate the fair value of asset retirement obligations by calculating the discounted cash flows that are dependent upon the following components: - Inflation adjustment -- The estimated cash flows are adjusted for inflation estimates for labor, equipment, materials, and other disposal costs; - Discount rate -- The estimated cash flows include contingency factors that were used as a proxy for the market risk premium; and - Third party markup adjustments -- Internal labor costs included in the cash flow calculation were adjusted for costs that a third party would incur in performing the tasks necessary to retire the asset. Changes in these factors could materially affect the obligation recorded to reflect the ultimate cost associated with retiring the assets under SFAS No. 143 and FIN 47. For example, if the inflation adjustment increased 25 basis points, this would increase the balance for asset retirement obligations by approximately 3.0%. Similarly, an increase in the discount rate by 25 basis points would decrease asset retirement obligations by approximately the same percentage. At December 31, 2005, our estimated cost of retiring these assets is approximately $76 million. UNBILLED ENERGY REVENUES Revenues related to the sale and/or delivery of electricity or natural gas (energy) are generally recorded when energy is delivered to customers. However, the determination of energy sales to individual customers is based on the reading of their meters, which is performed on a systematic basis throughout the month. At the end of each month, amounts of energy delivered to customers since the date of the last meter reading are estimated and the corresponding unbilled revenue is estimated. Unbilled electricity delivery revenue is estimated each month based on daily supply volumes, applicable rates and analyses reflecting significant historical trends and experience. Unbilled natural gas sales are estimated based on estimated purchased gas volumes, estimated lost and unaccounted for gas and tariffed rates in effect. As additional information becomes available, or actual amounts are determinable, the recorded estimates are revised. Consequently, operating results can be affected by revisions to prior accounting estimates. PENSION AND OTHER RETIREMENT PLANS We sponsor pension and other retirement plans in various forms covering all employees who meet eligibility requirements. We use several statistical and other factors which attempt to anticipate future events in calculating the expense and liability related to our plans. These factors include assumptions about the discount rate, expected return on plan assets and rate of future compensation increases as estimated by management, within certain guidelines. In addition, our actuarial consultants use subjective factors such as withdrawal and mortality rates. The actuarial assumptions used may differ materially from actual results due to changing market and economic conditions, higher or lower withdrawal rates or longer or shorter life spans of participants. These differences may result in a significant impact to the amount of pension expense recorded. Please read "-- Other Significant Matters -- Pension Plan" for further discussion. NEW ACCOUNTING PRONOUNCEMENTS See Note 2(n) to the consolidated financial statements for a discussion of new accounting pronouncements that affect us. OTHER SIGNIFICANT MATTERS Pension Plan. As discussed in Note 2(o) to our consolidated financial statements, we maintain a non-contributory pension plan covering substantially all employees. Employer contributions are based on actuarial computations that establish the minimum contribution required under the Employee Retirement Income Security Act of 1974 (ERISA) and the maximum deductible contribution for income tax purposes. At December 31, 2005, the projected benefit obligation exceeded the market value of plan assets by $20 million; 54 <PAGE> however, the market value of the plan assets exceeded the accumulated benefit obligation by $41 million. Changes in interest rates and the market values of the securities held by the plan during 2006 could materially, positively or negatively, change our funded status and affect the level of pension expense and required contributions in 2007 and beyond. Although we have not been required to make contributions to our pension plan in 2004 or 2005, we have made voluntary contributions of $476 million and $75 million in 2004 and 2005, respectively. Under the terms of our pension plan, we reserve the right to change, modify or terminate the plan. Our funding policy is to review amounts annually and contribute an amount at least equal to the minimum contribution required under ERISA and the Internal Revenue Code. In accordance with SFAS No. 87, "Employers' Accounting for Pensions," changes in pension obligations and assets may not be immediately recognized as pension costs in the income statement, but generally are recognized in future years over the remaining average service period of plan participants. As such, significant portions of pension costs recorded in any period may not reflect the actual level of benefit payments provided to plan participants. Pension costs were $90 million, $80 million and $30 million for 2003, 2004 and 2005, respectively. In addition, included in the costs for 2003, 2004 and 2005 are $17 million, $11 million and less than $1 million, respectively, of expense related to Texas Genco participants. Pension expense for Texas Genco participants is reflected in the Statement of Consolidated Operations as discontinued operations. Additionally, we maintain a non-qualified benefit restoration plan which allows participants to retain the benefits to which they would have been entitled under our non-contributory pension plan except for the federally mandated limits on qualified plan benefits or on the level of compensation on which qualified plan benefits may be calculated. The expense associated with this non-qualified plan was $8 million, $6 million and $6 million in 2003, 2004 and 2005, respectively. The calculation of pension expense and related liabilities requires the use of assumptions. Changes in these assumptions can result in different expense and liability amounts, and future actual experience can differ from the assumptions. Two of the most critical assumptions are the expected long-term rate of return on plan assets and the assumed discount rate. As of December 31, 2005, the expected long-term rate of return on plan assets was 8.5%, which is unchanged from the rate assumed as of December 31, 2004. We believe that our actual asset allocation, on average, will approximate the targeted allocation and the estimated return on net assets. We regularly review our actual asset allocation and periodically rebalance plan assets as appropriate. As of December 31, 2005, the projected benefit obligation was calculated assuming a discount rate of 5.70%, which is a 0.05% decline from the 5.75% discount rate assumed in 2004. The discount rate was determined by reviewing yields on high-quality bonds that receive one of the two highest ratings given by a recognized rating agency and the expected duration of pension obligations specific to the characteristics of our plan. Pension expense for 2006, including the benefit restoration plan, is estimated to be $38 million based on an expected return on plan assets of 8.5% and a discount rate of 5.70% as of December 31, 2005. If the expected return assumption were lowered by 0.5% (from 8.5% to 8.0%), 2006 pension expense would increase by approximately $8 million. Currently, pension plan assets (excluding the unfunded benefit restoration plan) exceed the accumulated benefit obligation by $41 million. However, if the discount rate were lowered by 0.5% (from 5.70% to 5.20%), the assumption change would increase our projected benefit obligation, accumulated benefit obligation and 2006 pension expense by approximately $131 million, $120 million and $11 million, respectively. In addition, the assumption change would have significant impacts on our Consolidated Balance Sheet by changing the pension asset recorded as of December 31, 2005 of $655 million to a pension liability of $79 million and would result in a charge to comprehensive income in 2005 of $477 million, net of tax. 55 <PAGE> For the benefit restoration plan, if the discount rate were lowered by 0.5% (from 5.70% to 5.20%), the assumption change would increase our projected benefit obligation, accumulated benefit obligation and 2006 pension expense by approximately $4 million, $4 million, and less than $1 million, respectively. In addition, the assumption change would result in a charge to comprehensive income of approximately $3 million. Future changes in plan asset returns, assumed discount rates and various other factors related to the pension plan will impact our future pension expense and liabilities. We cannot predict with certainty what these factors will be.
