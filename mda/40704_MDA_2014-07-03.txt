ITEM 7 Management Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations EXECUTIVE OVERVIEW We are a global consumer foods company. We develop distinctive value-added food products and market them under unique brand names. We work continuously to improve our established products and to create new products that meet consumers evolving needs and preferences. In addition, we build the equity of our brands over time with strong consumer-directed marketing, innovative new products, and effective merchandising. We believe our brand-building strategy is the key to winning and sustaining leading share positions in markets around the globe. Our fundamental financial goal is to generate superior returns for our stockholders over the long term. We believe that increases in net sales, segment operating profit, earnings per share (EPS), and return on average total capital are the key drivers of financial performance for our business. Our specific growth objectives are to consistently deliver: low single-digit annual growth in net sales; mid single-digit annual growth in total segment operating profit excluding Venezuela currency devaluation; high single-digit annual growth in diluted EPS excluding certain items affecting comparability; and improvement in return on average total capital. We believe that this financial performance, coupled with an attractive dividend yield, should result in long-term value creation for stockholders. We return a substantial amount of cash to stockholders through share repurchases and dividends. Fiscal 2014 was a challenging year, as developed markets continued to experience weak consumer trends and quite low category growth. The cereal category in developed markets was soft and the global yogurt category was impacted by significant dairy inflation. For the fiscal year ended May 25, 2014, our net sales grew 1 percent and total segment operating profit excluding Venezuela currency devaluation of $3,154 million declined 2 percent from $3,223 million last year. Our return on average total capital declined by 40 basis points, as fiscal 2014 earnings did not grow in line with our capital base. Diluted EPS grew 1 percent and diluted EPS excluding certain items affecting comparability increased 4 percent (See the Non-GAAP Measures section below for discussion of total segment operating profit excluding Venezuela currency devaluation, diluted EPS excluding certain items affecting comparability and return on average total capital, which are not defined by generally accepted accounting principles (GAAP)). Net cash provided by operations totaled $2.5 billion in fiscal 2014, enabling us to increase our annual dividend payments per share by 17 percent from fiscal 2013. We also made significant capital investments totaling $664 million in fiscal 2014 and repurchased $1.7 billion of shares of common stock. We achieved the following related to our key operating objectives for fiscal 2014: We delivered a strong line-up of consumer marketing, merchandising, and innovation to support our leading brands and continued to build our global platforms in markets around the world. We returned $2.7 billion to stockholders in fiscal 2014, including a 17 percent dividend increase and 47 percent more shares of common stock repurchased that resulted in a 3 percent net reduction in average shares outstanding. While we exercised good administrative cost control, executed strong holistic margin management (HMM) efforts, increased share repurchases and had favorable interest expense, net sales and segment operating profit excluding Venezuela currency devaluation performance were below our targets. We achieved 1 percent growth in net sales, primarily contributions from new businesses added in fiscal 2013. Total segment operating profit excluding Venezuela currency devaluation declined 2 percent and diluted EPS excluding certain items affecting comparability increased 4 percent. Details of our financial results are provided in the Fiscal 2014 Consolidated Results of Operations section below. 17 Table of Contents In fiscal 2015, we expect to generate constant currency growth consistent with our long-term model, including the effects of a 53 week year: We are targeting mid single-digit growth in constant currency net sales, primarily driven by volume growth and a 53 rd week, with double-digit growth in emerging markets and low single-digit growth in developed markets. We expect to grow share in the U.S. cereal category through significant product innovation, build on our improving performance in the U.S. yogurt category, and continue our strong growth in the snack category around the world. We are targeting mid single-digit growth in total constant currency segment operating profit in fiscal 2015. We continue to view our HMM discipline of cost savings and mix management as a competitive advantage. Cost of sales HMM is expected to offset anticipated input cost inflation of 3 percent. We are targeting high single-digit growth in constant currency diluted EPS excluding certain items affecting comparability. We expect to deliver strong cash returns to stockholders in fiscal 2015, including annualized dividends per share of $1.64 and share repurchases that are expected to result in a net reduction in shares outstanding of at least 3 percent. Our businesses generate strong levels of cash flows, and we will use some of this cash to reinvest in our business. Our fiscal 2015 plans call for approximately $730 million of expenditures for capital projects. Certain terms used throughout this report are defined in a glossary in Item 8 of this report. FISCAL 2014 CONSOLIDATED RESULTS OF OPERATIONS Our consolidated results for fiscal 2014 include one additional quarter of operating activity from the acquisition of Yoki Alimentos S.A. (Yoki) in Brazil, one additional quarter of operating activity from the assumption of the Canadian Yoplait franchise license, and three additional quarters of operating activity from the acquisition of Immaculate Baking Company in the United States. Collectively, these items are referred to as new businesses in comparing our fiscal 2014 results to fiscal 2013. Fiscal 2014 net sales grew 1 percent to $17,910 million including 1 percentage point of growth contributed by new businesses. Excluding new businesses, net sales grew 1 percent, offset by 1 percentage point of unfavorable foreign currency exchange. In fiscal 2014, net earnings attributable to General Mills were $1,824 million, down 2 percent from $1,855 million in fiscal 2013, and we reported diluted EPS of $2.83 in fiscal 2014, up 1 percent from $2.79 in fiscal 2013. Fiscal 2014 results include a gain on the divestiture of certain grain elevators, the impact of Venezuela currency devaluation, gains from the mark-to-market valuation of certain commodity positions and grain inventories, and restructuring charges related to our fiscal 2012 productivity and cost savings plan. Fiscal 2013 results include the effects from various discrete tax items, the impact of Venezuela currency devaluation, restructuring charges related to our fiscal 2012 productivity and cost savings plan, integration costs resulting from the acquisition of Yoki, and gains from the mark-to-market valuation of certain commodity positions and grain inventories. Diluted EPS excluding these items affecting comparability totaled $2.82 in fiscal 2014, up 4 percent from $2.72 in fiscal 2013 (see the Non-GAAP Measures section below for a description of our use of this measure and our discussion of the items affecting comparability). 18 Table of Contents The components of net sales growth are shown in the following table: Components of Net Sales Growth Fiscal 2014 vs. 2013 Contributions from volume growth (a) 1 pt Net price realization and mix 1 pt Foreign currency exchange (1) pt Net sales growth 1 pt (a) Measured in tons based on the stated weight of our product shipments. Net sales grew 1 percent in fiscal 2014 driven by an 1 percentage point increase in contributions from volume growth, including 2 percentage points of contribution from volume growth due to new businesses. Favorable net price realization and mix contributed 1 percentage point of growth, and unfavorable foreign currency exchange decreased net sales growth by 1 percentage point. Cost of sales increased $190 million in fiscal 2014 to $11,540 million. Higher volume drove an $115 million increase in cost of sales. Product mix also drove an $130 million increase in cost of sales. In fiscal 2014, we recorded a $49 million net decrease in cost of sales related to mark-to-market valuation of certain commodity positions and grain inventories as described in Note 7 to the Consolidated Financial Statements in Item 8 of this report, compared to a net decrease of $4 million in fiscal 2013. We also recorded a $23 million foreign exchange loss in fiscal 2014 related to the Venezuela currency devaluation compared to a $16 million loss in fiscal 2013. In fiscal 2013, we also recorded a $17 million non-recurring expense related to the assumption of the Canadian Yoplait franchise license. Gross margin declined 1 percent in fiscal 2014 versus fiscal 2013. Gross margin as a percent of net sales of 36 percent was relatively flat compared to fiscal 2013. Selling, general and administrative (SG&A) expenses decreased $78 million in fiscal 2014 versus fiscal 2013. The decrease in SG&A expenses was primarily driven by a 3 percent decrease in advertising and media expense, a smaller contribution to the General Mills Foundation, a decrease in incentive compensation expense and lower pension expense compared to fiscal 2013. In fiscal 2014, we recorded a $39 million charge related to Venezuela currency devaluation compared to a $9 million charge in fiscal 2013. In addition, we recorded $12 million of integration costs in fiscal 2013 related to our acquisition of Yoki. SG&A expenses as a percent of net sales decreased 1 percent compared to fiscal 2013. Restructuring, impairment, and other exit costs totaled $4 million in fiscal 2014. The restructuring charge related to a productivity and cost savings plan approved in the fourth quarter of fiscal 2012. These restructuring actions were completed in fiscal 2014. In fiscal 2014, we paid $22 million in cash related to restructuring actions. During fiscal 2014, we recorded a divestiture gain of $66 million related to the sale of certain grain elevators in our U.S. Retail segment. There were no divestitures in fiscal 2013. Interest, net for fiscal 2014 totaled $302 million, $15 million lower than fiscal 2013. The average interest rate decreased 41 basis points, including the effect of the mix of debt, generating a $31 million decrease in net interest. Average interest bearing instruments increased $367 million, generating a $16 million increase in net interest. 19 Table of Contents Our consolidated effective tax rate for fiscal 2014 was 33.3 percent compared to 29.2 percent in fiscal 2013. The 4.1 percentage point increase was primarily related to the restructuring of our General Mills Cereals, LLC (GMC) subsidiary during the first quarter of 2013 which resulted in a $63 million decrease to deferred income tax liabilities related to the tax basis of the investment in GMC and certain distributed assets, with a corresponding non-cash reduction to income taxes. During fiscal 2013, we also recorded a $34 million discrete decrease in income tax expense and an increase in our deferred tax assets related to certain actions taken to restore part of the tax benefits associated with Medicare Part D subsidies which had previously been reduced in fiscal 2010 with the enactment of the Patient Protection and Affordable Care Act, as amended by the Health Care and Education Reconciliation Act of 2010. Our fiscal 2013 tax expense also includes a $12 million charge associated with the liquidation of a corporate investment. After-tax earnings from joint ventures for fiscal 2014 decreased to $90 million compared to $99 million in fiscal 2013 primarily driven by increased consumer spending at Cereal Partners Worldwide (CPW) and unfavorable foreign currency exchange from H agen-Dazs Japan, Inc. (HDJ). The change in net sales for each joint venture is set forth in the following table: Joint Venture Change in Net Sales As Reported Constant Currency Basis Fiscal 2014 vs. 2013 Fiscal 2014 vs. 2013 CPW (1 )% Flat HDJ (8 ) 9 % Joint Ventures (2 )% 2 % In fiscal 2014, CPW net sales declined by 1 percentage point due to unfavorable foreign currency exchange. Contribution from volume growth was flat compared to fiscal 2013. In fiscal 2014, net sales for HDJ decreased 8 percentage points from fiscal 2013 as 11 percentage points of contributions from volume growth was offset by 17 percentage points of net sales decline from unfavorable foreign currency exchange and 2 percentage points of net sales decline attributable to unfavorable net price realization and mix. Average diluted shares outstanding decreased by 20 million in fiscal 2014 from fiscal 2013 due primarily to the repurchase of 36 million shares, partially offset by the issuance of 7 million shares related to stock compensation plans. FISCAL 2014 CONSOLIDATED BALANCE SHEET ANALYSIS Cash and cash equivalents increased $126 million from fiscal 2013. Receivables increased $37 million from fiscal 2013 primarily driven by timing of sales. Inventories increased $14 million from fiscal 2013. Prepaid expenses and other current assets decreased $29 million from fiscal 2013, mainly due to a decrease in other receivables related to the liquidation of a corporate investment. Land, buildings, and equipment increased $64 million from fiscal 2013, as $664 million of capital expenditures were partially offset by depreciation expense of $585 million. Goodwill and other intangible assets increased $27 million from fiscal 2013, primarily due to foreign exchange. Other assets increased $302 million from fiscal 2013, primarily related to favorable investment returns on pension plan assets. 20 Table of Contents Accounts payable increased $188 million from fiscal 2013, primarily due to the extension of payment terms. Notes payable and long-term debt, including current portion, increased $817 million from fiscal 2013 primarily due to $228 million of net long-term debt issuances and $573 million of net commercial paper issuances. The current and noncurrent portions of net deferred income taxes liability increased $331 million from fiscal 2013 primarily as a result of changes in the funded status of our defined benefit postretirement plans which were recognized through accumulated other comprehensive income (AOCI). Other current liabilities decreased $378 million from fiscal 2013, primarily driven by dividends declared in the fourth quarter of fiscal 2013 that were paid in the first quarter of fiscal 2014. Other liabilities decreased $310 million from fiscal 2013, primarily driven by a decrease in pension, postemployment, and postretirement liabilities. Redeemable interest increased $17 million from fiscal 2013. Retained earnings increased $1,085 million from fiscal 2013, reflecting fiscal 2014 net earnings of $1,824 million less dividends declared of $740 million. Treasury stock increased $1,532 million from fiscal 2013, due to $1,775 million of share repurchases, partially offset by $243 million related to stock-based compensation plans. Additional paid in capital increased $65 million from fiscal 2013, including $30 million related to the settlement of an accelerated share repurchase agreement. AOCI decreased by $245 million from fiscal 2013. Noncontrolling interests increased $14 million in fiscal 2014. FISCAL 2013 CONSOLIDATED RESULTS OF OPERATIONS Our consolidated results for fiscal 2013 include three quarters of operating activity from the acquisitions of Yoki in Brazil and Food Should Taste Good in the United States, and the assumption of the Canadian Yoplait franchise license (Yoplait Canada), four quarters of results for Yoplait Ireland and Parampara Foods in India, and two quarters of results for Immaculate Baking Company in the United States. Also included in the first quarter of fiscal 2013 are two additional months of results from the acquisition of Yoplait S.A.S. Collectively, these items are referred to as new businesses in comparing our fiscal 2013 results to fiscal 2012. Fiscal 2013 net sales grew 7 percent to $17,774 million. In fiscal 2013, net earnings attributable to General Mills were $1,855 million, up 18 percent from $1,567 million in fiscal 2012, and we reported diluted EPS of $2.79 in fiscal 2013, up 19 percent from $2.35 in fiscal 2012. Fiscal 2013 results include the effects from various discrete tax items, the impact of Venezuela currency devaluation, restructuring charges related to our fiscal 2012 productivity and cost savings plan, integration costs resulting from the acquisition of Yoki, and gains from the mark-to-market valuation of certain commodity positions and grain inventories. Fiscal 2012 results include losses from the mark-to-market valuation of certain commodity positions and grain inventories, restructuring charges related to our 2012 productivity and cost savings plan, and integration costs resulting from the acquisitions of Yoplait S.A.S. and Yoplait Marques S.A.S. Diluted EPS excluding these items affecting comparability totaled $2.72 in fiscal 2013, up 6 percent from $2.56 in fiscal 2012 (see the Non-GAAP Measures section below for a description of our use of this measure and our discussion of the items affecting comparability). 21 Table of Contents The components of net sales growth are shown in the following table: Components of Net Sales Growth Fiscal 2013 vs. 2012 Contributions from volume growth (a) 9 pts Net price realization and mix (1) pt Foreign currency exchange (1) pt Net sales growth 7 pts (a) Measured in tons based on the stated weight of our product shipments. Net sales grew 7 percent in fiscal 2013, including 6 percentage points of growth contributed by new businesses, primarily Yoki, Yoplait S.A.S., and Yoplait Canada. Excluding the impact of new businesses, net sales grew 2 percent, partially offset by 1 percentage point of unfavorable foreign currency exchange. Contributions from volume growth increased net sales by 9 percentage points, including 8 percentage points of contribution from volume growth due to new businesses. Unfavorable net price realization and mix decreased net sales growth by 1 percentage point and unfavorable foreign currency exchange decreased net sales growth by 1 percentage point. Cost of sales increased $737 million in fiscal 2013 to $11,350 million. Higher volume drove a $982 million increase in cost of sales. We also recorded a $17 million non-recurring expense related to the assumption of the Canadian Yoplait franchise license and a $16 million charge related to Venezuela currency devaluation in fiscal 2013. These increases were partially offset by a $170 million decrease in cost of sales attributable to product mix. In fiscal 2013, we recorded a $4 million net decrease in cost of sales related to mark-to-market valuation of certain commodity positions and grain inventories as described in Note 7 to the Consolidated Financial Statements in Item 8 of this report, compared to a net increase of $104 million in fiscal 2012. Gross margin grew 6 percent in fiscal 2013 versus fiscal 2012. Gross margin as a percent of net sales of 36 percent was relatively flat compared to fiscal 2012. SG&A expenses were up $172 million in fiscal 2013 versus fiscal 2012. The increase in SG&A expenses was primarily driven by the addition of new businesses and an increase in pension expense. In addition, we recorded a $9 million foreign exchange loss resulting from the remeasurement of assets and liabilities of our Venezuelan subsidiary following the devaluation of the bolivar in fiscal 2013. Excluding these items, SG&A expenses decreased compared to fiscal 2012, including a 2 percent decrease in advertising and media expense. SG&A expenses as a percent of net sales were flat compared to fiscal 2012. Restructuring, impairment, and other exit costs totaled $20 million in fiscal 2013. In fiscal 2013, we recorded a $19 million restructuring charge related to a productivity and cost savings plan approved in the fourth quarter of fiscal 2012, consisting of $11 million of employee severance expense and other exit costs of $8 million. All of our operating segments were affected by these actions including $16 million related to our International segment, $2 million related to our U.S. Retail segment, and $1 million related to our Convenience Stores and Foodservice segment. In addition, we recorded $1 million of charges associated with other previously announced restructuring actions. In fiscal 2013, we paid $80 million in cash related to restructuring actions. In fiscal 2012, we recorded a $102 million restructuring charge related to the productivity and cost savings plan approved in the fourth quarter of fiscal 2012. Interest, net for fiscal 2013 totaled $317 million, $35 million lower than fiscal 2012. The average interest rate decreased 60 basis points, including the effect of the mix of debt, generating a $43 million decrease in net interest. Average interest bearing instruments increased $167 million, primarily from an increase in incremental borrowing to fund the acquisition of Yoki, generating an $8 million increase in net interest. 22 Table of Contents Our consolidated effective tax rate for fiscal 2013 was 29.2 percent compared to 32.1 percent in fiscal 2012. The 2.9 percentage point decrease was primarily related to the restructuring of our GMC subsidiary during the first quarter of fiscal 2013 which resulted in a $63 million decrease to deferred income tax liabilities related to the tax basis of the investment in GMC and certain distributed assets, with a corresponding discrete non-cash reduction to income taxes. During fiscal 2013, we also recorded a $34 million discrete decrease in income tax expense and an increase in our deferred tax assets related to certain actions taken to restore part of the tax benefits associated with Medicare Part D subsidies which had previously been reduced in fiscal 2010 with the enactment of the Patient Protection and Affordable Care Act, as amended by the Health Care and Education Reconciliation Act of 2010. Our fiscal 2013 tax expense also includes a $12 million charge associated with the liquidation of a corporate investment. After-tax earnings from joint ventures for fiscal 2013 increased to $99 million compared to $88 million in fiscal 2012 primarily due to higher tax rates in fiscal 2012 as a result of discrete tax items and higher operating profit offset by unfavorable foreign currency exchange in fiscal 2013. The change in net sales for each joint venture is set forth in the following table: Joint Venture Change in Net Sales As Reported Constant Currency Basis Fiscal 2013 vs. 2012 Fiscal 2013 vs. 2012 CPW (1 )% 2 % HDJ (2 ) 5 Joint Ventures (1 )% 3 % In fiscal 2013, CPW net sales declined by 1 percentage point as 2 percentage points of net sales growth from favorable net price realization and mix were offset by 3 percentage points of net sales decline from unfavorable foreign currency exchange. Contribution from volume growth was flat compared to fiscal 2012. In fiscal 2013, net sales for HDJ decreased 2 percentage points from fiscal 2012 as 6 percentage points of net sales growth from volume contribution was offset by 7 percentage points of net sales decline from unfavorable foreign currency exchange and 1 percentage point of net sales decline attributable to unfavorable net price realization and mix. Average diluted shares outstanding decreased by 1 million in fiscal 2013 from fiscal 2012, due primarily to the repurchase of 24 million shares. RESULTS OF SEGMENT OPERATIONS Our businesses are organized into three operating segments: U.S. Retail; International; and Convenience Stores and Foodservice. 23 Table of Contents The following tables provide the dollar amount and percentage of net sales and operating profit from each segment for fiscal years 2014, 2013, and 2012: Fiscal Year 2014 2013 2012 In Millions Dollars Percent of Total Dollars Percent of Total Dollars Percent of Total Net Sales U.S. Retail $ 10,604.9 59 % $ 10,614.9 60 % $ 10,480.2 63 % International 5,385.9 30 5,200.2 29 4,194.3 25 Convenience Stores and Foodservice 1,918.8 11 1,959.0 11 1,983.4 12 Total $ 17,909.6 100 % $ 17,774.1 100 % $ 16,657.9 100 % Segment Operating Profit U.S. Retail $ 2,311.5 75 % $ 2,392.9 75 % $ 2,295.3 76 % International 472.9 15 490.2 15 429.6 14 Convenience Stores and Foodservice 307.3 10 314.6 10 286.7 10 Total $ 3,091.7 100 % $ 3,197.7 100 % $ 3,011.6 100 % Segment operating profit excludes unallocated corporate items, gain on divestitures, and restructuring, impairment, and other exit costs because these items affecting operating profit are centrally managed at the corporate level and are excluded from the measure of segment profitability reviewed by our executive management. U.S. RETAIL SEGMENT Our U.S. Retail segment reflects business with a wide variety of grocery stores, mass merchandisers, membership stores, natural food chains, and drug, dollar and discount chains operating throughout the United States. Our product categories in this business segment include ready-to-eat cereals, refrigerated yogurt, soup, meal kits, shelf stable and frozen vegetables, refrigerated and frozen dough products, dessert and baking mixes, frozen pizza and pizza snacks, grain, fruit and savory snacks, and a wide variety of organic products including granola bars, cereal, and soup. In fiscal 2014, net sales for our U.S. Retail segment were $10.6 billion, flat compared to fiscal 2013. Contributions from volume growth and net price realization and mix were flat compared to fiscal 2013. In fiscal 2013, net sales for this segment totaled $10.6 billion, up 1 percent from fiscal 2012 due to contributions from volume growth. Net price realization and mix was flat compared to fiscal 2012.

Big G division net sales growth was flat compared to fiscal 2013. The 1 percentage point increase in the fiscal 2013 U.S. Retail segment net sales was driven by the Snacks, Small Planet Foods, Baking Products, and Meals divisions, partially offset by declines in the Yoplait, Frozen Foods, and Big G divisions. Segment operating profit of $2.3 billion in fiscal 2014 declined $81 million, or 3 percent, from fiscal 2013. The decrease reflects higher trade spending, partially offset by a 1 percent reduction in advertising and media expense. Segment operating profit of $2.4 billion in fiscal 2013 improved $98 million, or 4 percent, from fiscal 2012. The increase was primarily driven by a 5 percent reduction in advertising and media expense, favorable net price realization and mix, and higher volume, partially offset by an increase in input costs. 25 Table of Contents INTERNATIONAL SEGMENT Our International segment consists of retail and foodservice businesses outside of the United States. Our product categories include ready-to-eat cereals, shelf stable and frozen vegetables, meal kits, refrigerated and frozen dough products, dessert and baking mixes, frozen pizza snacks, refrigerated yogurt, grain and fruit snacks, and super-premium ice cream and frozen desserts. We also sell super-premium ice cream and frozen desserts directly to consumers through owned retail shops. Our International segment also includes products manufactured in the United States for export, mainly to Caribbean and Latin American markets, as well as products we manufacture for sale to our international joint ventures. Revenues from export activities and franchise fees are reported in the region or country where the end customer is located. As part of a long-term plan to conform the fiscal year ends of all our operations, we have changed the reporting period of certain countries within our International segment from an April fiscal year end to a May fiscal year end to match our fiscal calendar. Accordingly, in the year of change, our results include 13 months of results from the affected operations compared to 12 months in previous and future fiscal years. In fiscal 2013, we changed the reporting period for our operations in Europe and Australia. In fiscal 2012, we changed the reporting period for our operations in China. The impact of these changes was not material to the fiscal 2013 or fiscal 2012 International segment results of operations. Net sales for our International segment were up 4 percent in fiscal 2014 compared to fiscal 2013, to $5,386 million, including 5 percentage points of growth from new businesses, primarily Yoki and Yoplait Canada. The growth in fiscal 2014 included 5 percentage points of contributions from volume growth, including 7 percentage points resulting from new businesses, and 3 percentage points of favorable net price realization and mix, partially offset by 4 percentage points of unfavorable foreign currency exchange. Net sales totaled $5,200 million in fiscal 2013, up 24 percent from $4,194 million in fiscal 2012. The growth in fiscal 2013 was driven by 21 percentage points from new businesses, primarily Yoki, Yoplait S.A.S., and Yoplait Canada. Excluding the impact of new businesses, net sales growth was up 3 percent. Volume contributed 34 percentage points of net sales growth, including 32 percentage points resulting from new businesses, partially offset by 6 percentage points of unfavorable net price realization and mix and 4 percentage points of unfavorable foreign currency exchange.

The impact to fiscal 2013 net sales growth for the International segment was not material. The 4 percentage point increase in the International segment fiscal 2014 net sales was driven by growth in the Latin America and Asia/Pacific regions, partially offset by declines in the Europe and Canada regions. On a constant currency basis, International segment net sales grew 8 percent, with 38 percent growth in the Latin America region, 9 percent growth in the Asia/Pacific region, and 5 percent growth in the Canada region, partially offset by 4 percent decline in the Europe region. The 24 percentage point increase in the International segment fiscal 2013 net sales was driven by growth across all regions. On a constant currency basis, International segment net sales grew 28 percent, with 139 percent growth in the Latin America region, 15 percent growth in the Europe region, 22 percent growth in the Canada region, and 11 percent growth in the Asia/Pacific region. Segment operating profit for fiscal 2014 declined 4 percent to $473 million from $490 million in fiscal 2013, primarily driven by unfavorable foreign currency exchange including a $62 million charge related to Venezuela currency devaluation in fiscal 2014 and higher input costs, partially offset by volume growth, favorable net price realization and mix, and an additional quarter of results from the Yoki acquisition. In addition we recorded a $17 million non-recurring expense related to the assumption of the Canadian Yoplait franchise license and a $25 million charge related to Venezuela currency devaluation in fiscal 2013. International segment operating profit excluding the impact of Venezuela currency devaluation was $535 million in fiscal 2014, an increase of 4 percent compared to $515 million in fiscal 2013 (see the Non-GAAP Measure section below for our use of this measure). Segment operating profit for fiscal 2013 grew 14 percent to $490 million from $430 million in fiscal 2012, primarily driven by volume growth, the Yoki acquisition, and a full year of activity from Yoplait S.A.S., partially offset by unfavorable foreign currency exchange, including a $25 million charge related to Venezuela currency devaluation. International segment operating profit excluding the impact of Venezuela currency devaluation was $515 million in fiscal 2013, a 20 percent increase compared to $430 million in fiscal 2012 (see the Non-GAAP Measure section below for our use of this measure). 27 Table of Contents Venezuela is a highly inflationary economy and as such, we remeasure the value of the assets and liabilities of our Venezuelan subsidiary based on the exchange rate at which we expect to remit dividends in U.S. dollars. In February 2013, the Venezuelan government devalued the bolivar by resetting the official exchange rate. The effect of the devaluation in fiscal 2013 was a $25 million foreign exchange loss in segment operating profit resulting from the remeasurement of assets and liabilities of our Venezuelan subsidiary. On February 19, 2014, the Venezuelan government established a new foreign exchange market mechanism ( SICAD 2 ) and has indicated that this will be the market through which U.S. dollars will be obtained for the remittance of dividends. This market has significantly higher foreign exchange rates than those available through the other foreign exchange mechanisms. In the fourth quarter of fiscal 2014, we recorded a $62 million foreign exchange loss in the International segment operating profit resulting from the remeasurement of assets and liabilities of our Venezuelan subsidiary at the SICAD 2 rate of 50.0 bolivars per U.S. dollar. We have been able to access U.S. dollars through the SICAD 2 market. Our Venezuela operations represent less than 1 percent of our consolidated assets, liabilities, net sales, and segment operating profit. As of May 25, 2014, we had $3 million of non-U.S. dollar cash balances in Venezuela. CONVENIENCE STORES AND FOODSERVICE SEGMENT In the first quarter of fiscal 2014, we changed the name of our Bakeries and Foodservice operating segment to Convenience Stores and Foodservice. The businesses in this segment were unchanged. Our major product categories are ready-to-eat cereals, snacks, refrigerated yogurt, unbaked and fully baked frozen dough products, baking mixes, and flour. Many products we sell are branded to the consumer and nearly all are branded to our customers. We sell to distributors and operators in many customer channels including foodservice, convenience stores, vending, and supermarket bakeries. Substantially all of this segment operations are located in the United States. For fiscal 2014, net sales for our Convenience Stores and Foodservice segment decreased 2 percent to $1,919 million primarily driven by an 1 percentage point decrease in contributions from volume growth and 1 percentage point of unfavorable net price realization and mix. Volume declines were driven by the loss of business with a major customer as well as the impact of inclement weather, as fiscal 2014 had a sharp increase in weather-related events such as school and business closings. Unfavorable net price realization and mix were driven by commodity index priced items. For fiscal 2013, net sales for our Convenience Stores and Foodservice segment decreased 1 percent to $1,959 million due to an 1 percentage point decrease in contributions from volume growth. Net price realization and mix was flat compared to fiscal 2012 as gains from favorable product mix were offset by declines in commodity index priced items.

The decrease was primarily driven by volume declines, unfavorable net price realization, and investments to protect and grow the business. In fiscal 2013, segment operating profit was $315 million, up 10 percent from $287 million in fiscal 2012. The increase was primarily driven by favorable product mix, lower manufacturing and input costs, and reduced administrative costs. UNALLOCATED CORPORATE ITEMS Unallocated corporate items include corporate overhead expenses, variances to planned domestic employee benefits and incentives, contributions to the General Mills Foundation, and other items that are not part of our measurement of segment operating performance. This includes gains and losses from mark-to-market valuation of certain commodity positions until passed back to our operating segments in accordance with our policy as discussed in Note 2 of the Consolidated Financial Statements in Item 8 of this report. For fiscal 2014, unallocated corporate expense totaled $196 million compared to $326 million last year. In fiscal 2014 we recorded a $49 million net decrease in expense related to mark-to-market valuation of certain commodity positions and grain inventories, compared to a $4 million net decrease in expense last year. Compensation and benefit expenses decreased $59 million and the contribution to the General Mills Foundation decreased in fiscal 2014 compared to fiscal 2013. In fiscal 2013, we also recorded $12 million of integration costs related to the acquisition of Yoki. Unallocated corporate expense totaled $326 million in fiscal 2013 compared to $348 million in fiscal 2012. In fiscal 2013, we recorded a $4 million net decrease in expense related to mark-to-market valuation of certain commodity positions and grain inventories, compared to a $104 million net increase in expense in fiscal 2012. Pension expense increased $40 million in fiscal 2013 compared to fiscal 2012. In fiscal 2013, we also recorded $12 million of integration costs related to the acquisition of Yoki. IMPACT OF INFLATION We have experienced significant input cost volatility for several years. Our gross margin performance in fiscal 2014 reflects the impact of 4 percent input cost inflation, primarily on commodities inputs. We expect input cost inflation of 3 percent in fiscal 2015. We attempt to minimize the effects of inflation through HMM, planning, and operating practices. Our risk management practices are discussed in Item 7A of this report. The Patient Protection and Affordable Care Act, as amended by the Health Care and Education Reconciliation Act of 2010 (collectively, the Act) was signed into law in March 2010. The Act codifies health care reforms with staggered effective dates from 2010 to 2018. Many provisions in the Act require the issuance of additional guidance from various government agencies. Because the Act does not take effect fully until future years, the Act did not have a material impact on our fiscal 2014, 2013, or 2012 results of operations. Estimates of the future impacts of several of the Act provisions are incorporated into our postretirement benefit liability. The Act may also impact our future health care benefit related expenses. Given the complexity of the Act, the extended time period over which the reforms will be implemented, and the unknown impact of future regulatory guidance, the full impact of the Act on future periods will not be known until those regulations are adopted. LIQUIDITY The primary source of our liquidity is cash flow from operations. Over the most recent three-year period, our operations have generated $7.9 billion in cash. A substantial portion of this operating cash flow has been returned to stockholders through share repurchases and dividends. We also use cash from operations to fund our capital expenditures and acquisitions. We typically use a combination of cash, notes payable, and long-term debt to finance significant acquisitions and major capital expansions. 29 Table of Contents As of May 25, 2014, we had $840 million of cash and cash equivalents held in foreign jurisdictions which will be used to fund foreign operations and acquisitions. There is currently no need to repatriate these funds in order to meet domestic funding obligations or scheduled cash distributions. If we choose to repatriate cash held in foreign jurisdictions, we intend to do so only in a tax-neutral manner. Cash Flows from Operations Fiscal Year In Millions 2014 2013 2012 Net earnings, including earnings attributable to redeemable and noncontrolling interests $ 1,861.3 $ 1,892.5 $ 1,589.1 Depreciation and amortization 585.4 588.0 541.5 After-tax earnings from joint ventures (89.6 ) (98.8 ) (88.2 ) Distributions of earnings from joint ventures 90.5 115.7 68.0 Stock-based compensation 108.5 100.4 108.3 Deferred income taxes 172.5 81.8 149.4 Tax benefit on exercised options (69.3 ) (103.0 ) (63.1 ) Pension and other postretirement benefit plan contributions (49.7 ) (223.2 ) (222.2 ) Pension and other postretirement benefit plan costs 124.1 131.2 77.8 Divestiture (gain) (65.5 ) Restructuring, impairment, and other exit costs (18.8 ) (60.2 ) 97.8 Changes in current assets and liabilities, excluding the effects of acquisitions (32.2 ) 471.1 243.8 Other, net (76.2 ) 30.5 (95.0 ) Net cash provided by operating activities $ 2,541.0 $ 2,926.0 $ 2,407.2 In fiscal 2014, our operations generated $2.5 billion of cash compared to $2.9 billion in fiscal 2013. The $385 million decrease is primarily due a $503 million change in current assets and liabilities. The change in current assets and liabilities is primarily driven by a $403 million change in other current liabilities largely due to changes in trade promotion and income tax accruals, and a $107 million change in inventory. In addition, in fiscal 2013 we made a $200 million voluntary contribution to our principal domestic pension plans. We strive to grow core working capital at or below the rate of growth in our net sales. For fiscal 2014, core working capital decreased 9 percent, compared to net sales growth of 1 percent, primarily due to an increase in accounts payable. In fiscal 2013, core working capital decreased 5 percent, compared to net sales growth of 7 percent, and in fiscal 2012, core working capital decreased 7 percent, compared to net sales growth of 12 percent. In fiscal 2013, our operations generated $2.9 billion of cash compared to $2.4 billion in fiscal 2012. The $519 million increase is primarily due to a $303 million increase in net earnings and $227 million from changes in current assets and liabilities. Other current liabilities accounted for $336 million of the increase in current assets and liabilities due to trade and tax accruals, and accounts payable accounted for $252 million of the increase partly as the result of the extension of payment terms. These were partially offset by a $214 million change in prepaid expenses and other current assets primarily due to changes in derivative receivables and changes in other receivables related to the liquidation of a corporate investment, and a $126 million change in inventory largely driven by a lower level of inventory reduction activity compared to fiscal 2012. In both fiscal 2013 and fiscal 2012, we made a $200 million voluntary contribution to our principal domestic pension plans. In addition, we paid $80 million in cash related to restructuring actions in fiscal 2013. 30 Table of Contents Cash Flows from Investing Activities Fiscal Year In Millions 2014 2013 2012 Purchases of land, buildings, and equipment $ (663.5 ) $ (613.9 ) $ (675.9 ) Acquisitions, net of cash acquired (898.0 ) (1,050.1 ) Investments in affiliates, net (54.9 ) (40.4 ) (22.2 ) Proceeds from disposal of land, buildings, and equipment 6.6 24.2 2.2 Proceeds from divestiture 121.6 Exchangeable note 29.3 16.2 (131.6 ) Other, net (0.9 ) (3.5 ) 6.8 Net cash used by investing activities $ (561.8 ) $ (1,515.4 ) $ (1,870.8 ) In fiscal 2014, cash used by investing activities decreased by $954 million from fiscal 2013. We invested $664 million in land, buildings, and equipment in fiscal 2014, $50 million more than the same period last year. We made $55 million of investments in affiliates, primarily CPW, in fiscal 2014. In the fourth quarter of fiscal 2014 we sold certain grain elevators for approximately $122 million in cash, subject to a working capital adjustment. In addition we received $29 million in payments from Sodiaal International (Sodiaal) in fiscal 2014 against the $132 million exchangeable note we purchased in 2012. In fiscal 2013, cash used by investing activities decreased by $355 million from fiscal 2012. In fiscal 2013, we acquired Yoki, a privately held food company headquartered in Sao Bernardo do Campo, Brazil, for an aggregate purchase price of $940 million, comprised of $820 million of cash, net of $31 million of cash acquired, and $120 million of non-cash consideration for debt assumed. We invested $614 million in land, buildings, and equipment in fiscal 2013, $62 million less than the same period in fiscal 2012. In addition, we received $16 million in payments from Sodiaal in fiscal 2013 against the $132 million exchangeable note. We expect capital expenditures to be approximately $730 million in fiscal 2015. These expenditures will support initiatives that are expected to fuel International growth, increase manufacturing capacity for Snacks, and continue HMM initiatives throughout the supply chain.

We had $387 million more net debt issuances in fiscal 2014 than the same period a year ago. For more information on our debt issuances, please refer to Note 8 to the Consolidated Financial Statements in Item 8 of this report. During fiscal 2014, we received $108 million in proceeds from common stock issued on exercised options compared to $301 million in fiscal 2013, a decrease of $193 million. During fiscal 2012, we received $234 million in proceeds from common stock issued on exercised options. In June 2010, our Board of Directors authorized the repurchase of up to 100 million shares of our common stock. The Board terminated this authorization in May 2014 and approved a new authorization for the repurchase of up to 100 million shares of our common stock. Purchases under the authorization can be made in the open market or in privately negotiated transactions, including the use of call options and other derivative instruments, Rule 10b5-1 trading plans, and accelerated repurchase programs. The authorization has no specified termination date. During fiscal 2014, we paid $1,745 million to repurchase 36 million shares of our common stock. During fiscal 2013, we repurchased 24 million shares of our common stock for an aggregate purchase price of $1,015 million, including 6 million shares with a fair value of $270 million purchased as part of an accelerated share repurchase (ASR) agreement. Under the terms of this agreement, we also paid an additional $30 million to the unrelated financial institution for shares which were settled in the first quarter of fiscal 2014. During fiscal 2012, we repurchased 8 million shares of our common stock for an aggregate purchase price of $313 million. Dividends paid in fiscal 2014 totaled $983 million, or $1.55 per share, a 17 percent per share increase from fiscal 2013. Dividends paid in fiscal 2013 totaled $868 million, or $1.32 per share, an 8 percent per share increase from fiscal 2012 dividends of $1.22 per share. On March 11, 2014, our Board of Directors approved a dividend increase, effective with the May 1, 2014 payment, to an annual rate of $1.64 per share, a 6 percent increase from the rate paid in fiscal 2014. Selected Cash Flows from Joint Ventures Selected cash flows from our joint ventures are set forth in the following table: Fiscal Year Inflow (Outflow), in Millions 2014 2013 2012 Advances to joint ventures, net $ (54.9 ) $ (36.7 ) $ (22.2 ) Dividends received 90.5 115.7 68.0 CAPITAL RESOURCES Total capital consisted of the following: In Millions May 25, 2014 May 26, 2013 Notes payable $ 1,111.7 $ 599.7 Current portion of long-term debt 1,250.6 1,443.3 Long-term debt 6,423.5 5,926.1 Total debt 8,785.8 7,969.1 Redeemable interest 984.1 967.5 Noncontrolling interests 470.6 456.3 Stockholders equity 6,534.8 6,672.2 Total capital $ 16,775.3 $ 16,065.1 32 Table of Contents The following table details the fee-paid committed and uncommitted credit lines we had available as of May 25, 2014: In Billions Facility Amount Borrowed Amount Credit facility expiring: April 2017 $1.7 $ May 2019 1.0 Total committed credit facilities 2.7 Uncommitted credit facilities 0.4 0.1 Total committed and uncommitted credit facilities $3.1 $0.1 To ensure availability of funds, we maintain bank credit lines sufficient to cover our outstanding short-term borrowings. Commercial paper is a continuing source of short-term financing. We have commercial paper programs available to us in the United States and Europe. We also have uncommitted and asset-backed credit lines that support our foreign operations. The credit facilities contain several covenants, including a requirement to maintain a fixed charge coverage ratio of at least 2.5 times. Certain of our long-term debt agreements, our credit facilities, and our noncontrolling interests contain restrictive covenants. As of May 25, 2014, we were in compliance with all of these covenants. We have $1,251 million of long-term debt maturing in the next 12 months that is classified as current. We believe that cash flows from operations, together with available short- and long-term debt financing, will be adequate to meet our liquidity and capital needs for at least the next 12 months. As of May 25, 2014, our total debt, including the impact of derivative instruments designated as hedges, was 71 percent in fixed-rate and 29 percent in floating-rate instruments, compared to 73 percent in fixed-rate and 27 percent in floating-rate instruments on May 26, 2013. The change in the fixed-rate and floating-rate percentages was driven by increased commercial paper issuances. Growth in return on average total capital is one of our key performance measures (see the Non-GAAP Measures section below for our discussion of this measure, which is not defined by GAAP). Return on average total capital decreased from 12.0 percent in fiscal 2013 to 11.6 percent in fiscal 2014, as fiscal 2014 earnings did not grow in line with our capital base. We also believe that our fixed charge coverage ratio and the ratio of operating cash flow to debt are important measures of our financial strength. Our fixed charge coverage ratio in fiscal 2014 was 8.04 compared to 7.62 in fiscal 2013. The measure increased from fiscal 2013 as earnings before income taxes and after-tax earnings from joint ventures increased by $120 million and fixed charges decreased by $10 million, driven primarily by lower interest. Our operating cash flow to debt ratio decreased 7.8 percentage points to 28.9 percent in fiscal 2014, driven by an increase in total debt. We have a 51 percent controlling interest in Yoplait S.A.S. and a 50 percent interest in Yoplait Marques S.A.S. and Libert Marques S.a.r.l. Sodiaal holds the remaining interests in each of these entities. We consolidate these entities into our consolidated financial statements. We record Sodiaal 50 percent interest in Yoplait Marques S.A.S. and Libert Marques S.a.r.l. as noncontrolling interests, and their 49 percent interest in Yoplait S.A.S. as a redeemable interest on our Consolidated Balance Sheets. These euro- and Canadian dollar-denominated interests are reported in U.S. dollars on our Consolidated Balance Sheets. Sodiaal has the ability to put a limited portion of its redeemable interest to us at fair value once per year up to a maximum remaining term of 6 years. As of May 25, 2014, the redemption value of the redeemable interest was $984 million which approximates its fair value. During the first quarter of fiscal 2013, in conjunction with the consent of the Class A investor, we restructured General Mills Cereals, LLC (GMC) through the distribution of its manufacturing assets, stock, inventory, cash and certain intellectual property to a wholly owned subsidiary. GMC retained the remaining intellectual property. Immediately following the restructuring, the Class A Interests of GMC were sold by the then current holder to another unrelated third-party investor. 33 Table of Contents The third-party holder of the GMC Class A Interests receives quarterly preferred distributions from available net income based on the application of a floating preferred return rate, currently equal to the sum of three-month LIBOR plus 110 basis points, to the holder capital account balance established in the most recent mark-to-market valuation (currently $252 million). The preferred return rate is adjusted every three years through a negotiated agreement with the Class A Interest holder or through a remarketing auction. The holder of the Class A Interests may initiate a liquidation of GMC under certain circumstances, including, without limitation, the bankruptcy of GMC or its subsidiaries, GMC failure to deliver the preferred distributions on the Class A Interests, GMC failure to comply with portfolio requirements, breaches of certain covenants, lowering of our senior debt rating below either Baa3 by Moody or BBB- by Standard & Poor s, and a failed attempt to remarket the Class A Interests. In the event of a liquidation of GMC, each member of GMC will receive the amount of its then current capital account balance. We may avoid liquidation by exercising our option to purchase the Class A Interests. We may exercise our option to purchase the Class A Interests for consideration equal to the then current capital account value, plus any unpaid preferred return and the prescribed make-whole amount. If we purchase these interests, any change in the unrelated third-party investor capital account from its original value will be charged directly to retained earnings and will increase or decrease the net earnings used to calculate EPS in that period. OFF-BALANCE SHEET ARRANGEMENTS AND CONTRACTUAL OBLIGATIONS As of May 25, 2014, we have issued guarantees and comfort letters of $341 million for the debt and other obligations of consolidated subsidiaries, and guarantees and comfort letters of $284 million for the debt and other obligations of non-consolidated affiliates, mainly CPW. In addition, off-balance sheet arrangements are generally limited to the future payments under non-cancelable operating leases, which totaled $388 million as of May 25, 2014. As of May 25, 2014, we had invested in five variable interest entities (VIEs). None of our VIEs are material to our results of operations, financial condition, or liquidity as of and for the year ended May 25, 2014. Our defined benefit plans in the United States are subject to the requirements of the Pension Protection Act (PPA). The PPA revised the basis and methodology for determining defined benefit plan minimum funding requirements as well as maximum contributions to and benefits paid from tax-qualified plans. The PPA may ultimately require us to make additional contributions to our domestic plans. We do not expect to be required to make any contributions in fiscal 2015. 34 Table of Contents The following table summarizes our future estimated cash payments under existing contractual obligations, including payments due by period: Payments Due by Fiscal Year In Millions Total 2015 2016 - 17 2018 - 19 2020 and Thereafter Long-term debt (a) $ 7,681.0 $ 1,249.5 $ 2,000.0 $ 1,250.0 $3,181.5 Accrued interest 92.5 92.5 Operating leases (b) 388.5 93.9 130.2 76.1 88.3 Capital leases 2.5 1.5 1.0 Purchase obligations (c) 2,830.4 2,203.6 446.8 95.2 84.8 Total contractual obligations 10,994.9 3,641.0 2,578.0 1,421.3 3,354.6 Other long-term obligations (d) 1,520.9 Total long-term obligations $ 12,515.8 $ 3,641.0 $ 2,578.0 $ 1,421.3 $3,354.6 (a) Amounts represent the expected cash payments of our long-term debt and do not include $2 million for capital leases or $9 million for net unamortized bond premiums and discounts and fair value adjustments. (b) Operating leases represents the minimum rental commitments under non-cancelable operating leases. (c) The majority of the purchase obligations represent commitments for raw material and packaging to be utilized in the normal course of business and for consumer marketing spending commitments that support our brands. For purposes of this table, arrangements are considered purchase obligations if a contract specifies all significant terms, including fixed or minimum quantities to be purchased, a pricing structure, and approximate timing of the transaction. Most arrangements are cancelable without a significant penalty and with short notice (usually 30 days). Any amounts reflected on the Consolidated Balance Sheets as accounts payable and accrued liabilities are excluded from the table above. (d) The fair value of our foreign exchange, equity, commodity, and grain derivative contracts with a payable position to the counterparty was $28 million as of May 25, 2014, based on fair market values as of that date. Future changes in market values will impact the amount of cash ultimately paid or received to settle those instruments in the future. Other long-term obligations mainly consist of liabilities for accrued compensation and benefits, including the underfunded status of certain of our defined benefit pension, other postretirement benefit, and postemployment plans, and miscellaneous liabilities. We expect to pay $21 million of benefits from our unfunded postemployment benefit plans and $14 million of deferred compensation in fiscal 2015. We are unable to reliably estimate the amount of these payments beyond fiscal 2015. As of May 25, 2014, our total liability for uncertain tax positions and accrued interest and penalties was $193 million. SIGNIFICANT ACCOUNTING ESTIMATES For a complete description of our significant accounting policies, see Note 2 to the Consolidated Financial Statements in Item 8 of this report. Our significant accounting estimates are those that have a meaningful impact on the reporting of our financial condition and results of operations. These estimates include our accounting for promotional expenditures, valuation of long-lived assets, intangible assets, redeemable interest, stock-based compensation, income taxes, and defined benefit pension, other postretirement, and postemployment benefits. Promotional Expenditures Our promotional activities are conducted through our customers and directly or indirectly with end consumers. These activities include: payments to customers to perform merchandising activities on our behalf, such as advertising or in-store displays; discounts to our list prices to lower retail shelf prices; payments to gain distribution of new products; coupons, contests, and other incentives; and media and advertising expenditures. The recognition of these costs requires estimation of customer participation and performance levels. These estimates are made based on the forecasted customer sales, the timing and forecasted costs of promotional activities, and other factors. Differences between estimated expenses and actual costs are recognized as a change in management estimate in a subsequent period. Our accrued trade, coupon, and consumer marketing liabilities were $578 million as of May 25, 2014, and $635 million as of May 26, 2013. Because our total promotional expenditures (including amounts classified as a reduction of revenues) are significant, if our estimates are inaccurate we would have to make adjustments in subsequent periods that could have a material effect on our results of operations. 35 Table of Contents Valuation of Long-Lived Assets We estimate the useful lives of long-lived assets and make estimates concerning undiscounted cash flows to review for impairment whenever events or changes in circumstances indicate that the carrying amount of an asset (or asset group) may not be recoverable. Fair value is measured using discounted cash flows or independent appraisals, as appropriate. Intangible Assets Goodwill and other indefinite lived intangible assets are not subject to amortization and are tested for impairment annually and whenever events or changes in circumstances indicate that impairment may have occurred. Our estimates of fair value for goodwill impairment testing are determined based on a discounted cash flow model. We use inputs from our long-range planning process to determine growth rates for sales and profits. We also make estimates of discount rates, perpetuity growth assumptions, market comparables, and other factors. We evaluate the useful lives of our other intangible assets, mainly brands, to determine if they are finite or indefinite-lived. Reaching a determination on useful life requires significant judgments and assumptions regarding the future effects of obsolescence, demand, competition, other economic factors (such as the stability of the industry, known technological advances, legislative action that results in an uncertain or changing regulatory environment, and expected changes in distribution channels), the level of required maintenance expenditures, and the expected lives of other related groups of assets. Intangible assets that are deemed to have definite lives are amortized on a straight-line basis, over their useful lives, generally ranging from 4 to 30 years. Our estimate of the fair value of our brand assets is based on a discounted cash flow model using inputs which include projected revenues from our long-range plan, assumed royalty rates that could be payable if we did not own the brands, and a discount rate. As of May 25, 2014, we had $13.1 billion of goodwill and indefinite-lived intangible assets. Our Europe and Yoplait U.S. reporting units and Uncle Toby and Mountain High brands have experienced declining business performance and we will continue to monitor these businesses. While we currently believe that the fair value of each intangible exceeds its carrying value and that those intangibles so classified will contribute indefinitely to our cash flows, materially different assumptions regarding future performance of our businesses or a different weighted-average cost of capital could result in significant impairment losses and amortization expense. We performed our fiscal 2014 assessment of our intangible assets as of November 25, 2013. As of our annual assessment date, there was no impairment of any of our intangible assets as their related fair values were substantially in excess of the carrying values, except for the Uncle Toby brand, which had a fair value 8 percent greater than its carrying value of $63 million. In addition, our Mountain High brand had a fair value 23 percent greater than its carrying value of $35 million. Redeemable Interest During the third quarter of fiscal 2014, we adjusted the redemption value of Sodiaal redeemable interest in Yoplait S.A.S. based on a discounted cash flow model. The significant assumptions used to estimate the redemption value include projected revenue growth and profitability from our long-range plan, capital spending, depreciation and taxes, foreign currency rates, and a discount rate. As of May 25, 2014, the redemption value of the redeemable interest was $984 million. Stock-based Compensation The valuation of stock options is a significant accounting estimate that requires us to use judgments and assumptions that are likely to have a material impact on our financial statements. Annually, we make predictive assumptions regarding future stock price volatility, employee exercise behavior, dividend yield, and the forfeiture rate. For more information on these assumptions, please refer to Note 11 to the Consolidated Financial Statements in Item 8 of this report. 36 Table of Contents The estimated fair values of stock options granted and the assumptions used for the Black-Scholes option-pricing model were as follows: Fiscal Year 2014 2013 2012 Estimated fair values of stock options granted $6.03 $3.65 $5.88 Assumptions: Risk-free interest rate 2.6 % 1.6 % 2.9 % Expected term 9.0 years 9.0 years 8.5 years Expected volatility 17.4 % 17.3 % 17.6 % Dividend yield 3.1 % 3.5 % 3.3 % The risk-free interest rate for periods during the expected term of the options is based on the U.S. Treasury zero-coupon yield curve in effect at the time of grant. An increase in the expected term by 1 year, leaving all other assumptions constant, would increase the grant date fair value by 2 percent. If all other assumptions are held constant, a one percentage point increase in our fiscal 2014 volatility assumption would increase the grant date fair value of our fiscal 2014 option awards by 7 percent. To the extent that actual outcomes differ from our assumptions, we are not required to true up grant-date fair value-based expense to final intrinsic values. However, these differences can impact the classification of cash tax benefits realized upon exercise of stock options, as explained in the following two paragraphs. Furthermore, historical data has a significant bearing on our forward-looking assumptions. Significant variances between actual and predicted experience could lead to prospective revisions in our assumptions, which could then significantly impact the year-over-year comparability of stock-based compensation expense. Any corporate income tax benefit realized upon exercise or vesting of an award in excess of that previously recognized in earnings (referred to as a windfall tax benefit) is presented in the Consolidated Statements of Cash Flows as a financing cash flow. The actual impact on future years financing cash flows will depend, in part, on the volume of employee stock option exercises during a particular year and the relationship between the exercise-date market value of the underlying stock and the original grant-date fair value previously determined for financial reporting purposes. Realized windfall tax benefits are credited to additional paid-in capital within the Consolidated Balance Sheets. Realized shortfall tax benefits (amounts which are less than that previously recognized in earnings) are first offset against the cumulative balance of windfall tax benefits, if any, and then charged directly to income tax expense, potentially resulting in volatility in our consolidated effective income tax rate. We calculated a cumulative amount of windfall tax benefits for the purpose of accounting for future shortfall tax benefits and currently have sufficient cumulative windfall tax benefits to absorb projected arising shortfalls, such that we do not currently expect future earnings to be affected by this provision. However, as employee stock option exercise behavior is not within our control, it is possible that materially different reported results could occur if different assumptions or conditions were to prevail. Income Taxes We apply a more-likely-than-not threshold to the recognition and derecognition of uncertain tax positions. Accordingly, we recognize the amount of tax benefit that has a greater than 50 percent likelihood of being ultimately realized upon settlement. Future changes in judgment related to the expected ultimate resolution of uncertain tax positions will affect earnings in the quarter of such change. For more information on income taxes, please refer to Note 14 to the Consolidated Financial Statements in Item 8 of this report. Defined Benefit Pension, Other Postretirement Benefit, and Postemployment Benefit Plans We have defined benefit pension plans covering most employees in the United States, Canada, France, and the United Kingdom. We also sponsor plans that provide health care benefits to the majority of our retirees in the United States, Canada, and Brazil. Under certain circumstances, we also provide accruable benefits to former or inactive employees in the United States, Canada, and Mexico, and members of our Board of Directors, including severance and certain other benefits payable upon death. Please refer to Note 13 to the Consolidated Financial Statements in 37 Table of Contents Item 8 to this report for a description of our defined benefit pension, other postretirement benefit, and postemployment benefit plans. We recognize benefits provided during retirement or following employment over the plan participants active working lives. Accordingly, we make various assumptions to predict and measure costs and obligations many years prior to the settlement of our obligations. Assumptions that require significant management judgment and have a material impact on the measurement of our net periodic benefit expense or income and accumulated benefit obligations include the long-term rates of return on plan assets, the interest rates used to discount the obligations for our benefit plans, and the health care cost trend rates. Expected Rate of Return on Plan Assets Our expected rate of return on plan assets is determined by our asset allocation, our historical long-term investment performance, our estimate of future long-term returns by asset class (using input from our actuaries, investment services, and investment managers), and long-term inflation assumptions. We review this assumption annually for each plan, however, our annual investment performance for one particular year does not, by itself, significantly influence our evaluation. Our historical investment returns (compound annual growth rates) for our United States defined benefit pension and other postretirement benefit plan assets were 15.3 percent, 13.9 percent, 9.2 percent, 8.4 percent, and 9.9 percent for the 1, 5, 10, 15, and 20 year periods ended May 25, 2014. On a weighted-average basis, the expected rate of return for all defined benefit plans was 8.53 percent for fiscal 2014, 8.53 percent for fiscal 2013, and 9.52 percent for fiscal 2012. Lowering the expected long-term rate of return on assets by 100 basis points would increase our net pension and postretirement expense by $59 million for fiscal 2015. A market-related valuation basis is used to reduce year-to-year expense volatility. The market-related valuation recognizes certain investment gains or losses over a five-year period from the year in which they occur. Investment gains or losses for this purpose are the difference between the expected return calculated using the market-related value of assets and the actual return based on the market-related value of assets. Our outside actuaries perform these calculations as part of our determination of annual expense or income. Discount Rates Our discount rate assumptions are determined annually as of the last day of our fiscal year for our defined benefit pension, other postretirement benefit, and postemployment benefit plan obligations. We work with our outside actuaries to determine the timing and amount of expected future cash outflows to plan participants and, using the Aa Above Median corporate bond yield, to develop a forward interest rate curve, including a margin to that index based on our credit risk. This forward interest rate curve is applied to our expected future cash outflows to determine our discount rate assumptions. Our weighted-average discount rates were as follows: Defined Benefit Pension Plans Other Postretirement Benefit Plans Postemployment Benefit Plans Obligations as of May 25, 2014, and fiscal 2015 expense 4.54 % 4.51 % 3.82 % Obligations as of May 26, 2013, and fiscal 2014 expense 4.54 % 4.50 % 3.70 % Fiscal 2013 expense 4.85 % 4.70 % 3.86 % Lowering the discount rates by 100 basis points would increase our net defined benefit pension, other postretirement benefit, and postemployment benefit plan expense for fiscal 2015 by approximately $96 million. All obligation-related experience gains and losses are amortized using a straight-line method over the average remaining service period of active plan participants. 38 Table of Contents Health Care Cost Trend Rates We review our health care cost trend rates annually. Our review is based on data we collect about our health care claims experience and information provided by our actuaries. This information includes recent plan experience, plan design, overall industry experience and projections, and assumptions used by other similar organizations. Our initial health care cost trend rate is adjusted as necessary to remain consistent with this review, recent experiences, and short-term expectations. Our initial health care cost trend rate assumption is 7.3 percent for retirees age 65 and over and 6.5 percent for retirees under age 65 at the end of fiscal 2014. Rates are graded down annually until the ultimate trend rate of 5.0 percent is reached in 2025 for all retirees. The trend rates are applicable for calculations only if the retirees benefits increase as a result of health care inflation. The ultimate trend rate is adjusted annually, as necessary, to approximate the current economic view on the rate of long-term inflation plus an appropriate health care cost premium. Assumed trend rates for health care costs have an important effect on the amounts reported for the other postretirement benefit plans. A one percentage point change in the health care cost trend rate would have the following effects: In Millions One Percentage Point Increase One Percentage Point Decrease Effect on the aggregate of the service and interest cost components in fiscal 2015 $ 4.7 $ (3.9 ) Effect on the other postretirement accumulated benefit obligation as of May 25, 2014 82.7 (73.2 ) Any arising health care claims cost-related experience gain or loss is recognized in the calculation of expected future claims. Once recognized, experience gains and losses are amortized using a straight-line method over 15 years, resulting in at least the minimum amortization required being recorded. Financial Statement Impact In fiscal 2014, we recorded net defined benefit pension, other postretirement benefit, and postemployment benefit plan expense of $140 million compared to $159 million of expense in fiscal 2013 and $106 million of expense in fiscal 2012. As of May 25, 2014, we had cumulative unrecognized actuarial net losses of $1.4 billion on our defined benefit pension plans and $80 million on our postretirement and postemployment benefit plans, mainly as the result of liability increases from lower interest rates, partially offset by recent increases in the values of plan assets. These unrecognized actuarial net losses will result in increases in our future pension expense and increases in postretirement expense since they currently exceed the corridors defined by GAAP. We use the 2014 IRS Static Mortality Table projected forward to our plans measurement dates to calculate the year-end defined benefit pension, other postretirement benefit, and postemployment benefit obligations and annual expense. Actual future net defined benefit pension, other postretirement benefit, and postemployment benefit plan income or expense will depend on investment performance, changes in future discount rates, changes in health care cost trend rates, and other factors related to the populations participating in these plans. RECENTLY ISSUED ACCOUNTING PRONOUNCEMENTS In May 2014, the Financial Accounting Standards Board issued new accounting requirements for the recognition of revenue from contracts with customers. The requirements of the new standard are effective for annual reporting periods beginning after December 15, 2016, and interim periods within those annual periods, which for us is the first quarter of fiscal 2018. We do not expect this guidance to have a material impact on our results of operations or financial position. 39 Table of Contents NON-GAAP MEASURES We have included in this report measures of financial performance that are not defined by GAAP. We believe that these measures provide useful information to investors, and include these measures in other communications to investors. For each of these non-GAAP financial measures, we are providing below a reconciliation of the differences between the non-GAAP measure and the most directly comparable GAAP measure, an explanation of why our management or the Board of Directors believes the non-GAAP measure provides useful information to investors, and any additional purposes for which our management or Board of Directors uses the non-GAAP measure. These non-GAAP measures should be viewed in addition to, and not in lieu of, the comparable GAAP measure. International Segment Operating Profit Excluding the Impact of Venezuela Currency Devaluation This measure is used in reporting to our executive management and as a component of the Board of Director measurement of our performance for incentive compensation purposes. We believe that this measure provides useful information to investors because it provides transparency to the underlying performance of the International segment by excluding the volatility related to the remeasurement of our Venezuelan subsidiary balance sheet. A reconciliation of this measure to International segment operating profit follows: Fiscal Year 2014 2013 2012 2011 2010 International segment operating profit $ 472.9 $ 490.2 $ 429.6 $ 291.4 $ 192.1 Impact of Venezuela currency devaluation 62.2 25.2 14.0 International segment operating profit excluding Venezuela currency devaluation $ 535.1 $ 515.4 $ 429.6 $ 291.4 $ 206.1 Total Segment Operating Profit Excluding the Impact of Venezuela Currency Devaluation This measure is used in reporting to our executive management and as a component of the Board of Director measurement of our performance for incentive compensation purposes. We believe that this measure provides useful information to investors because it provides transparency to underlying segment performance by excluding the volatility related to the remeasurement of our Venezuelan subsidiary balance sheet. A reconciliation of this measure to operating profit, the relevant GAAP measure, follows: Fiscal Year 2014 2013 2012 2011 2010 Operating profit: U.S. Retail $ 2,311.5 $ 2,392.9 $ 2,295.3 $ 2,348.0 $ 2,385.1 International, excluding Venezuela currency devaluation 535.1 515.4 429.6 291.4 206.1 Convenience Stores and Foodservice 307.3 314.6 286.7 306.3 263.3 Total segment operating profit excluding Venezuela currency devaluation 3,153.9 3,222.9 3,011.6 2,945.7 2,854.5 Unallocated corporate items 196.2 326.1 347.6 184.1 202.9 Divestiture (gain) (65.5 ) (17.4 ) Restructuring, impairment, and other exit costs 3.6 19.8 101.6 4.4 31.4 Venezuela currency devaluation 62.2 25.2 14.0 Operating profit $ 2,957.4 $ 2,851.8 $ 2,562.4 $ 2,774.6 $ 2,606.2 40 Table of Contents Diluted EPS Excluding Certain Items Affecting Comparability This measure is used in reporting to our executive management and as a component of the Board of Director measurement of our performance for incentive compensation purposes. We believe that this measure provides useful information to investors because it is the profitability measure we use to evaluate earnings performance on a comparable year-over-year basis. The adjustments are either items resulting from infrequently occurring events or items that, in management judgment, significantly affect the year-over-year assessment of operating results. The reconciliation of diluted EPS excluding certain items affecting comparability to diluted EPS, the relevant GAAP measure, follows: Fiscal Year Per Share Data 2014 2013 2012 2011 2010 Diluted earnings per share, as reported $ 2.83 $ 2.79 $ 2.35 $ 2.70 $ 2.24 Mark-to-market effects (a) (0.05 ) 0.10 (0.09 ) 0.01 Divestiture gain, net (b) (0.06 ) Tax items (c) (0.13 ) (0.13 ) 0.05 Acquisition integration costs (d) 0.01 0.01 Venezuela currency devaluation (e) 0.09 0.03 0.01 Restructuring costs (f) 0.01 0.02 0.10 Diluted earnings per share, excluding certain items affecting comparability $ 2.82 $ 2.72 $ 2.56 $ 2.48 $ 2.31 (a) See Note 7 to the Consolidated Financial Statements in Item 8 of this report.

To present this information, current period results for entities reporting in currencies other than United States dollars are translated into United States dollars at the average exchange rates in effect during the corresponding period of the prior fiscal year, rather than the actual average exchange rates in effect during the current fiscal year. Therefore, the foreign currency impact is equal to current year results in local currencies multiplied by the change in the average foreign currency exchange rate between the current fiscal period and the corresponding period of the prior fiscal year.
