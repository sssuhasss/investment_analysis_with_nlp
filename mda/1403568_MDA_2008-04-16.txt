Overview We were founded in 1990 as a discount beauty retailer at a time when prestige, mass and salon products were sold through separate distribution channels. In 1999 we embarked on a multi-year strategy to understand and embrace what women want in a beauty retailer and transform Ulta into the shopping experience that it is today. We pioneered what we believe to be our unique combination of beauty superstore and specialty store attributes. We believe our strategy provides us with the competitive advantages that have contributed to our strong financial performance. We are currently the largest beauty retailer that provides one-stop shopping for prestige, mass and salon products and salon services in the United States. We combine the unique elements of a beauty superstore with the distinctive environment and experience of a specialty retailer. Key aspects of our beauty superstore strategy include our ability to offer our customers a broad selection of over 21,000 beauty products across the categories of cosmetics, fragrance, haircare, skincare, bath and body products and salon styling tools, as well as salon haircare products. We focus on delivering a compelling value proposition to our customers across all of our product categories. Our stores are conveniently located in high-traffic, primarily off-mall locations such as power centers and lifestyle centers with other destination retailers. As of February 2, 2008, we operated 249 stores across 31 states. In addition to these fundamental elements of a beauty superstore, we strive to offer an uplifting shopping experience through what we refer to as The Four E : Escape, Education, Entertainment and Esthetics. The continued growth of our business and any future increases in net sales, net income and cash flows is dependent on our ability to execute our growth strategy, including growing our store base, expanding our prestige brand offerings, driving incremental salon traffic, expanding our online business and continuing to enhance our brand awareness. We believe that the steadily expanding U.S. beauty products and services industry, the shift in distribution of prestige beauty products from department stores to specialty retail stores, coupled with Ulta competitive strengths, positions us to capture additional market share in the industry through successful execution of our growth strategy. Comparable store sales is a key metric that is monitored closely within the retail industry. We do not expect our future comparable store sales increases to reflect the levels experienced in prior periods. This is due in part to the difficulty in improving on such significant increases in subsequent periods. The Company adopted a structured stock option compensation program in July 2007. The award of stock options under this program will result in increased stock-based compensation expense in future periods as compared to the expense reflected in our historical financial statements. Over the long-term, our growth strategy is to increase total net sales through increases in our comparable store sales and by opening new stores. Gross profit as a percentage of net sales is expected to be relatively consistent with historical rates given our planned 28 distribution infrastructure investments and the impact of the rate of new store growth. We plan to continue to improve our operating results by leveraging our fixed costs and decreasing our selling, general and administrative expenses, as a percentage of our net sales. On October 30, 2007, we completed an initial public offering in which we sold 7,666,667 shares of common stock resulting in net proceeds of $123.6 million after deducting underwriting discounts and commissions and offering expenses. Selling stockholders sold 2,153,928 additional shares of common stock. We did not receive any proceeds from the sale of shares by the selling stockholders. We used the net proceeds from the offering to pay $93.0 million of accumulated dividends in arrears on our preferred stock, which satisfied all amounts due with respect to accumulated dividends, $4.8 million to redeem our Series III preferred stock, and $25.8 million to reduce our borrowings under our third amended and restated loan and security agreement and for general corporate purposes. Also in connection with the offering, we converted preferred shares into 41,524,002 common shares and restated the par value of our common stock to $0.01 per share. Basis of presentation Net sales include store and e-commerce merchandise sales as well as salon service revenue. Salon service revenue represents less than 10% of our combined product sales and services revenues and therefore, these revenues are combined with product sales. We recognize merchandise revenue at the point of sale (POS) in our retail stores and the time of shipment in the case of Internet sales. Merchandise sales are recorded net of estimated returns. Salon service revenue is recognized at the time the service is provided. Gift card sales revenue is deferred until the customer redeems the gift card. Company coupons and other incentives are recorded as a reduction of net sales. Comparable store sales reflect sales for stores beginning on the first day of the 14th month of operation. Therefore, a store is included in our comparable store base on the first day of the period after one year of operations plus the initial one month grand opening period. Non-comparable store sales include sales from new stores that have not yet completed their 13th month of operation and stores that were closed for part or all of the period in either year as a result of remodel activity. Remodeled stores are included in comparable store sales unless the store was closed for a portion of the current or prior period. There may be variations in the way in which some of our competitors and other retailers calculate comparable or same store sales. As a result, data herein regarding our comparable store sales may not be comparable to similar data made available by our competitors or other retailers. Comparable store sales is a critical measure that allows us to evaluate the performance of our store base as well as several other aspects of our overall strategy. Several factors could positively or negatively impact our comparable store sales results: the introduction of new products or brands; the location of new stores in existing store markets; competition; our ability to respond on a timely basis to changes in consumer preferences; the effectiveness of our various marketing activities; and the number of new stores opened and the impact on the average age of all of our comparable stores. Cost of sales includes: the cost of merchandise sold, including all vendor allowances, which are treated as a reduction of merchandise costs; warehousing and distribution costs including labor and related benefits, freight, rent, depreciation and amortization, real estate taxes, utilities, and insurance; store occupancy costs including rent, depreciation and amortization, real estate taxes, utilities, repairs and maintenance, insurance, licenses, and cleaning expenses; salon payroll and benefits; and shrink and inventory valuation reserves. 29 Our cost of sales may be negatively impacted as we open an increasing number of stores. We also expect that cost of sales as a percentage of net sales will be negatively impacted in the next several years as a result of accelerated depreciation related to our store remodel program. The program was adopted in third quarter fiscal 2006. We have accelerated depreciation expense on assets to be disposed of during the remodel process such that those assets will be fully depreciated at the time of the planned remodel. Changes in our merchandise mix may also have an impact on cost of sales. This presentation of items included in cost of sales may not be comparable to the way in which our competitors or other retailers compute their cost of sales. Selling, general and administrative expenses include: payroll, bonus and benefit costs for retail and corporate employees; advertising and marketing costs; occupancy costs related to our corporate office facilities; public company expense including Sarbanes-Oxley compliance expenses; stock-based compensation expense related to option grants which will result in increases in expense as we implemented a structured stock option compensation program in 2007; depreciation and amortization for all assets except those related to our retail and warehouse operations, which is included in cost of sales; and legal, finance, information systems and other corporate overhead costs. This presentation of items in selling, general and administrative expenses may not be comparable to the way in which our competitors or other retailers compute their selling, general and administrative expenses. Pre-opening expense includes non-capital expenditures during the period prior to store opening for new and remodeled stores including store set-up labor, management and employee training, and grand opening advertising. Pre-opening expenses also includes rent during the construction period related to new stores. Interest expense includes interest costs associated with our credit facility, which is structured as an asset based lending instrument. Our interest expense will fluctuate based on the seasonal borrowing requirements associated with acquiring inventory in advance of key holiday selling periods and fluctuation in the variable interest rates we are charged on outstanding balances. Our credit facility is used to fund seasonal inventory needs and new and remodel store capital requirements in excess of our cash flow from operations. Our credit facility interest is based on a variable interest rate structure which can result in increased cost in periods of rising interest rates. Income tax expense reflects the federal statutory tax rate and the weighted average state statutory tax rate for the states in which we operate stores. 30 Results of operations Our fiscal years are the 52 or 53 week periods ending on the Saturday closest to January 31. The Company fiscal years ended February 2, 2008, February 3, 2007 and January 28, 2006 were 52, 53 and 52 week years, respectively, and are hereafter referred to as fiscal 2007, fiscal 2006 and fiscal 2005. The following tables present the components of our results of operations for the periods indicated: Fiscal year ended February 2, February 3, January 28, (In thousands) 2008 2007 2006 Net sales $ 912,141 $ 755,113 $ 579,075 Cost of sales 628,495 519,929 404,794 Gross profit 283,646 235,184 174,281 Selling, general and administrative expenses 225,167 188,000 140,145 Pre-opening expenses 11,758 7,096 4,712 Operating income 46,721 40,088 29,424 Interest expense 4,542 3,314 2,951 Income before income taxes 42,179 36,774 26,473 Income tax expense 16,844 14,231 10,504 Net income $ 25,335 $ 22,543 $ 15,969 Other operating data: Number stores end of period 249 196 167 Comparable store sales increase 6.4 % 14.5 % 8.3 % Fiscal year ended February 2, February 3, January 28, (Percentage of net sales) 2008 2007 2006 Net sales 100.0 % 100.0 % 100.0 % Cost of sales 68.9 % 68.9 % 69.9 % Gross profit 31.1 % 31.1 % 30.1 % Selling, general and adminstrative expenses 24.7 % 24.9 % 24.2 % Pre-opening expenses 1.3 % 0.9 % 0.8 % Operating income 5.1 % 5.3 % 5.1 % Interest expense 0.5 % 0.4 % 0.5 % Income before income taxes 4.6 % 4.9 % 4.6 % Income tax expense 1.8 % 1.9 % 1.8 % Net income 2.8 % 3.0 % 2.8 % 31 Fiscal year 2007 versus fiscal year 2006 Net sales Net sales increased $157.0 million, or 20.8%, to $912.1 million in fiscal 2007 compared to $755.1 million in fiscal 2006. Fiscal 2006 was a 53-week operating year and the 53rd week represented approximately $16.4 million in net sales. Adjusted for the 53rd week, fiscal 2007 net sales increased $173.4 million, or 23.5% compared to fiscal 2006. This increase is due to the opening of 53 new stores in 2007 and a 6.4% increase in comparable store sales. Non-comparable stores, which include stores opened in fiscal 2007 as well as stores opened in fiscal 2006 which have not yet turned comparable, contributed $127.9 million of the net sales increase while comparable stores contributed $45.5 million of the total net sales increase. Our comparable store sales growth in fiscal 2007 was driven by a balance in growth of customer traffic and average transaction value. We attribute these results to the continued effectiveness of our marketing strategy, particularly in a difficult holiday season, and double-digit growth in our prestige cosmetics category consistent with our growth strategy. Gross profit Gross profit increased $48.4 million, or 20.6%, to $283.6 million in fiscal 2007, compared to $235.2 million, in fiscal 2006. Gross profit as a percentage of net sales was 31.1% in fiscal 2007 and fiscal 2006. Gross profit in fiscal 2007 was impacted by: an increase of $157.0 million in net sales from new stores and comparable sales growth; a 30 basis point decrease due to warehouse management software-related inefficiencies during the first half of fiscal 2007; and a 20 basis point increase due to increased vendor co-op monies on increased advertising compared to the prior year. Selling, general and administrative expenses Selling, general and administrative expenses increased $37.2 million, or 19.8%, to $225.2 million in fiscal 2007 compared to $188.0 million in fiscal 2006. As a percentage of net sales, selling, general and administrative expenses decreased 20 basis points to 24.7% for fiscal 2007 compared to 24.9% in fiscal 2006. This decrease in the selling, general and administrative percentage resulted from: operating expenses from new stores opened in fiscal 2007 and fiscal 2006; 20 basis point decrease in stock compensation expense representing the net effects of new 2007 stock option grants and the non-recurring stock compensation charge of $2.8 million in fiscal 2006; a 40 basis point increase in marketing expense driven by increased number of advertising vehicles and circulation to drive customer traffic mainly during the fourth quarter of fiscal 2007; and the remainder is primarily attributed to improved leverage in corporate overhead and store payroll on higher sales compared to the prior year. Pre-opening expenses Pre-opening expenses increased $4.7 million, or 65.7%, to $11.8 million in fiscal 2007 compared to $7.1 million in fiscal 2006. During fiscal 2007, we opened 53 new stores and remodeled 17 stores. During fiscal 2006, we opened 31 new stores and remodeled 7 stores. Interest expense Interest expense increased $1.2 million, or 37.1%, to $4.5 million in fiscal 2007 compared to $3.3 million in fiscal 2006 primarily due to a $27.0 million increase in the average debt outstanding on our variable rate credit facility during fiscal 2007. Income tax expense Income tax expense of $16.8 million in fiscal 2007 represents an effective tax rate of 39.9%, compared to fiscal 2006 tax expense of $14.2 million which represents an effective tax rate of 38.7%. The increase in the effective tax rate is primarily due to an adjustment in fiscal 2006 to reflect the benefit of state tax effects of our net operating loss carry forwards. Net income Net income increased $2.8 million, or 12.4%, to $25.3 million in fiscal 2007 compared to $22.5 million in fiscal 2006. The increase in net income of $2.8 million resulted from an increase in gross profit of $48.4 million driven by a comparable store sales increase of 6.4%. The increase in gross profit was partially offset by a $37.2 million increase in selling, general and administrative expenses and a $4.7 million increase in pre-opening expenses. 32 Fiscal year 2006 versus fiscal year 2005 Net sales Net sales increased $176.0 million, or 30.4%, to $755.1 million in fiscal 2006 compared to $579.1 million in fiscal 2005. Fiscal 2006 was a 53-week operating year and the 53rd week represented approximately $16.4 million in net sales. Adjusted for the 53rd week, fiscal 2006 net sales increased $159.6 million, or 27.6% compared to fiscal 2005. This increase is due to the opening of 31 new stores in 2006, two store closures, and a 14.5% increase in comparable store sales. Non-comparable stores, which include stores opened in fiscal 2006 as well as stores opened in fiscal 2005 which have not yet turned comparable, contributed $77.3 million of the net sales increase while comparable stores contributed $82.3 million of the total net sales increase. Our comparable store sales growth in fiscal 2006 was driven by strong performance of existing and new brands. We introduced several new fragrance brands in the first half of the year which resulted in increased customer traffic and growth in average transaction value. Gross profit Gross profit increased $60.9 million, or 34.9%, to $235.2 million in fiscal 2006, compared to $174.3 million, in fiscal 2005. Gross profit as a percentage of net sales increased 100 basis points to 31.1% in fiscal 2006 from 30.1% in fiscal 2005. The increase in gross profit resulted from: an increase of $176.0 million in net sales from new stores and comparable sales growth; a 60 basis point improvement in salon payroll and benefits driven by improved salon stylist productivity resulting from a continued focus on training programs and other strategic initiatives; a 50 basis point decrease due to $3.5 million of planned accelerated depreciation related to our store remodel program; a 30 basis point improvement resulting from a reduction in merchandise shrink as a result of continued focus and improvement in overall store and supply chain inventory controls and specific in-store initiatives targeted at controlling merchandise loss, and improvement in our distribution and supply chain costs as we focus on increasing the efficiency of these operations and leverage the growth in our store base; and a 30 basis point improvement in leverage of store occupancy costs as a result of comparable store sales growth. Selling, general and administrative expenses Selling, general and administrative expenses increased $47.9 million, or 34.2%, to $188.0 million in fiscal 2006 compared to $140.1 million in fiscal 2005. As a percentage of net sales, selling, general and administrative expenses increased 70 basis points to 24.9% for fiscal 2006 compared to 24.2% in fiscal 2005. This increase in the selling, general and administrative percentage resulted from: operating expenses from new stores opened in fiscal 2006 and fiscal 2005; a non-recurring stock compensation charge of $2.8 million, or 40 basis points, primarily related to a former executive of the Company; $0.7 million of share-based compensation expense related to our adoption of Statement of Financial Accounting Standards (SFAS) 123R in fiscal 2006 which increased selling, general and administrative expenses by 10 basis points; and $0.6 million of incremental asset write-offs related to closed or remodeled stores representing 10 basis points. Pre-opening expenses Pre-opening expenses increased $2.4 million, or 50.6%, to $7.1 million in fiscal 2006 compared to $4.7 million in fiscal 2005. During fiscal 2006, we opened 31 new stores and remodeled 7 stores. During fiscal 2005, we opened 25 new stores and remodeled 1 store. Interest expense Interest expense increased $0.3 million, or 12.3%, to $3.3 million in fiscal 2006 compared to $3.0 million in fiscal 2005 primarily due to an increase in the interest rates on our variable rate credit facility. Income tax expense Income tax expense of $14.2 million in fiscal 2006 represents an effective tax rate of 38.7%, compared to fiscal 2005 tax expense of $10.5 million which represents an effective tax rate of 39.7%. The decrease in the effective tax rate is primarily due to an adjustment to reflect the state tax effects of our net operating loss carry forwards. Net income Net income increased $6.5 million, or 41.2%, to $22.5 million in fiscal 2006 compared to $16.0 million in fiscal 2005. The after-tax impact of the non-recurring stock compensation charge was approximately $1.7 million. The increase in net income of $6.5 million 33 resulted from an increase in gross profit of $60.9 million driven by a comparable store sales increase of 14.5% and a 100 basis point increase in gross profit as a percentage of sales. The increase in gross profit was partially offset by a $47.9 million (including the $2.8 million non-recurring stock compensation charge) increase in selling, general and administrative expenses related to operating costs for new stores opened in fiscal 2005 and fiscal 2006 as well as costs incurred to support the infrastructure necessary to manage current and future store growth. Liquidity and capital resources Our primary cash needs are for capital expenditures for new, relocated and remodeled stores, increased merchandise inventories related to store expansion, expansion of our headquarters, a new second distribution facility, and for continued improvement in our information technology systems. Our primary sources of liquidity are cash flows from operations, changes in working capital, and borrowings under our credit facility. The most significant component of our working capital is merchandise inventories reduced by related accounts payable and accrued expenses. Our working capital position benefits from the fact that we generally collect cash from sales to customers the same day, or within several days of the related sale, while we typically have up to 30 days to pay our vendors. Our working capital needs are greatest from August through November each year as a result of our inventory build-up during this period for the approaching holiday season. This is also the time of year when we are at maximum investment levels in our new store class and have not yet collected landlord allowances due us as part of our lease agreements. Based on past performance and current expectations, we believe that cash generated from operations and borrowings under the credit facility, with the accordion option exercised, will satisfy the Company working capital needs, capital expenditure needs, commitments, and other liquidity requirements through at least the next 12 months. Merchandise inventories were $176.1 million at February 2, 2008, an increase of $46.9 million compared to the prior year end. Approximately $40.9 million of the increase resulted from the addition of 53 new stores opened since the end of fiscal 2006. The remaining increase is related to inventory for 14 new stores that will open in the first quarter of fiscal 2008. Average inventory per store increased approximately 3.6% compared to fiscal 2006. On October 30, 2007, we completed an initial public offering in which we sold 7,666,667 shares of common stock to the public at a price of $18.00 per share resulting in aggregate gross proceeds from the sale of shares of common stock of $138.0 million. Selling stockholders sold 2,153,928 additional shares of common stock. We did not receive any proceeds from the sale of shares by the selling stockholders. The aggregate net proceeds to us were $123.6 million after deducting $9.7 million in underwriting discounts and commissions and $4.7 million in offering expenses. We used the net proceeds from the offering to pay $93.0 million of accumulated dividends in arrears on our preferred stock, which satisfied all amounts due with respect to accumulated dividends, $4.8 million to redeem our Series III preferred stock, and $25.8 million to reduce our borrowings under our third amended and restated loan and security agreement and for general corporate purposes. Also in connection with the offering, we converted preferred shares into 41,524,002 common shares and restated the par value of our common stock to $0.01 per share. Credit facility Our credit facility is with LaSalle Bank National Association as the administrative agent, Wachovia Capital Finance Corporation as collateral agent, and JP Morgan Chase Bank as documentation agent. This facility provides maximum credit of $150 million and a $50 million accordion option through May 31, 2011. The credit facility agreement contains a restrictive financial covenant on tangible net worth. Substantially all of our assets are pledged as collateral for outstanding borrowings under the facility. Outstanding borrowings bear interest at the prime rate or the Eurodollar rate plus 1.00% up to $100 million and 1.25% thereafter. The advance rates on owned inventory are 80% (85% from September 1 to January 31). The interest rate on the outstanding balances under the facility as of February 2, 2008 and February 3, 2007 was 4.812% and 7.025%, respectively. We had approximately $73.1 million and $48.9 million of availability as of February 2, 2008 and February 3, 2007, respectively, excluding the accordion option. We also have an ongoing letter of credit that renews annually which had a balance of $0.3 million as of February 2, 2008 and February 3, 2007. 34 Operating activities Operating activities consist of net income adjusted for certain non-cash items, including depreciation and amortization, non-cash stock-based compensation, excess tax benefits from stock-based compensation, realized losses on disposal of property and equipment, and the effect of working capital changes. Fiscal year ended February 2, February 3, January 28, (In thousands) 2008 2007 2006 Net income $ 25,335 $ 22,543 $ 15,969 Items not affecting cash: Depreciation and amoritzation 39,503 29,736 22,285 Deferred income taxes (3,284 ) (3,080 ) (3,037 ) Non-cash stock compensation charges 2,283 983 468 Excess tax benefits from stock-based compensation (1,575 ) (5,360 ) (213 ) Loss on disposal of property and equipment 195 3,518 1,230 Changes in working capital items (15,551 ) 7,290 899 Net cash provided by operations $ 46,906 $ 55,630 $ 37,601 The decrease in net cash from operating activities of $8.7 million in fiscal 2007 compared to fiscal 2006 is primarily attributed to the following: a decrease of $22.8 million in net working capital changes mainly attributed to a combination of an increase in merchandise inventories ($27.0 million), an increase in deferred rent related to new store lease terms ($11.0 million), a decrease in accrued liabilities ($4.6 million), and an increase in prepaid and other assets ($3.1 million); and an increase in depreciation and amortization of $9.8 million attributed to new stores opened in fiscal 2007 and fiscal 2006 and accelerated depreciation related to our remodel program. The increase in net cash from operating activities of $18.0 million in fiscal 2006 compared to fiscal 2005 is primarily attributed to the following: an increase in net income of $6.6 million; an increase in depreciation and amortization of $7.5 million attributed to new stores opened in fiscal 2006 and fiscal 2005 and accelerated depreciation related to our remodel program; an increase of $6.4 million in net working capital changes mainly attributed to a combination of increases in deferred rent related to new store lease terms ($2.8 million), an increase in accrued liabilities ($4.0 million), a decrease in prepaid and other assets ($2.1 million), and an increase in landlord allowances receivable related to additional new stores opened in fiscal 2006 ($2.5 million); a decrease of $5.1 million related to increased volume of excess tax benefits recognized from stock-based compensation; and an increase of $2.3 million on loss on disposal of property and equipment representing write-offs of remodel store assets and other store fixtures. 35 Investing activities Investing activities consist primarily of capital expenditures for new and remodeled stores as well as investments in information technology systems. Fiscal year ended February 2, February 3, January 28, (In thousands) 2008 2007 2006 Purchases of property and equipment, net $ (101,866 ) $ (62,331 ) $ (41,607 ) Receipt of related party notes receivable 4,467 Issuance of related party notes receivable (2,414 ) Net cash used in investing activities $ (97,399 ) $ (64,745 ) $ (41,607 ) During fiscal 2006, our Chief Executive Officer exercised stock options in exchange for a promissory note for $4.1 million. The Company withheld $2.4 million of payroll-related taxes in connection with the exercised options and that portion of the note has been classified as an investing activity. The remainder of the promissory note of $1.7 million related to exercise proceeds of the options and was classified as a non-cash financing activity. The note was paid in full on June 29, 2007. All of the related party notes receivable were settled during fiscal 2007. Financing activities Financing activities consist principally of draws and payments on our credit facility and capital stock transactions. Fiscal year ended February 2, February 3, January 28, (In thousands) 2008 2007 2006 Proceeds on long-term borrowings $ 1,094,590 $ 851,468 $ 644,817 Payments on long-term borrowings (1,070,557 ) (846,112 ) (641,652 ) Proceeds from issuance of common stock in initial public offering, net of issuance costs 123,608 Payment of accumulated dividends in arrears (93,012 ) Redemption of Series III preferred stock (4,792 ) Purchase of treasury stock (1,950 ) (2,217 ) Excess tax benefits from stock-based compensation 1,575 5,360 213 Proceeds from issuance of common stock under stock plans 1,175 1,422 615 Principal payments under capital lease obligations (167 ) Proceeds from issuance of preferred stock 15 Net cash provided by financing activities $ 50,637 $ 9,921 $ 3,841 The increase in net cash provided by financing activities of $40.7 million in fiscal 2007 is primarily the result of net proceeds of $123.6 million obtained in our initial public offering to pay $93.0 million of accumulated dividends in arrears on our preferred stock, $4.8 million to redeem our Series III preferred stocks, and $25.8 million to reduce our borrowings under our third amended and restated loan and security agreement and for general corporate purposes. In addition, the net increase of $18.7 million in long-term borrowings was attributable to the increase in merchandise inventories and new store capital expenditures as a result of the increase in new store openings. The increase in net cash provided by financing activities of $6.1 million in fiscal 2006 is due to the $5.1 million increase in excess tax benefits from stock-based compensation, $0.8 million increase in proceeds recognized by the Company resulting from the exercise of stock options by employees, net of a $2.2 million outflow related to a treasury stock transaction with an investor. 36 Seasonality Our business is subject to seasonal fluctuation. Significant portions of our net sales and profits are realized during the fourth quarter of the fiscal year due to the holiday selling season. To a lesser extent, our business is also affected by Mothers Day as well as the Back to School season and Valentines Day. Any decrease in sales during these higher sales volume periods could have an adverse effect on our business, financial condition, or operating results for the entire fiscal year. Our quarterly results of operations have varied in the past and are likely to do so again in the future. As such, we believe that period-to-period comparisons of our results of operations should not be relied upon as an indication of our future performance. Impact of inflation and changing prices Although we do not believe that inflation has had a material impact on our financial position or results of operations to date, a high rate of inflation in the future may have an adverse effect on our ability to maintain current levels of gross margin and selling, general and administrative expenses as a percentage of net sales if the selling prices of our products do not increase with these increased costs. In addition, inflation could materially increase the interest rates on our debt. Off-balance sheet arrangements Our off-balance sheet arrangements consist of operating lease obligations and letters of credit. We do not have any non-cancelable purchase commitments as of February 2, 2008. Our letters of credit outstanding under our revolving credit facility were $0.3 million as of February 2, 2008. Contractual obligations We lease retail stores, warehouses, corporate offices and certain equipment under operating leases with various expiration dates through fiscal 2019. Our store leases generally have initial lease terms of 10 years and include renewal options under substantially the same terms and conditions as the original leases. In addition to future minimum lease payments, most of our lease agreements include escalating rent provisions which we recognize straight-line over the term of the lease, including any lease renewal periods deemed to be probable. For certain locations, we receive cash tenant allowances and we report these amounts as deferred rent, which is amortized on a straight-line basis as a reduction of rent expense over the term of the lease, including any lease renewal periods deemed to be probable. While a number of our store leases include contingent rentals, contingent rent amounts are insignificant. The following table summarizes our contractual arrangements and the timing and effect that such commitments are expected to have on our liquidity and cash flows in future periods. The table below excludes variable expenses related to contingent rent, common area maintenance, insurance and real estate taxes. The table below includes obligations for executed agreements for which we do not yet have the right to control the use of the property as of February 2, 2008: Less Than 1 to 3 3 to 5 After 5 (In thousands) Total 1 Year Years Years Years Operating lease obligations(1) $ 589,991 $ 68,549 $ 145,522 $ 127,272 $ 248,648 Revolving credit facility(2) 74,770 74,770 Total $ 664,761 $ 68,549 $ 145,522 $ 202,042 $ 248,648 (1) Variable operating lease obligations related to common area maintenance, insurance and real estate taxes are not included in the table above. Total expense related to common area maintenance, insurance and real estate taxes for fiscal 2007 was $13.8 million. (2) Interest payments on the variable rate revolving credit facility are not included in the table above. Outstanding borrowings bear interest at the prime rate or the Eurodollar rate plus 1.00% up to $100 million and 1.25% thereafter. The interest rate on the outstanding balances under the facility as of February 2, 2008 was 4.812%. Critical accounting policies and estimates Management discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations is based upon our consolidated financial statements, which have been prepared in accordance with U.S. generally accepted accounting principals (GAAP). The preparation of these financial statements required the use of estimates and judgments that affect the reported amounts of our assets, liabilities, 37 revenues and expenses. Management bases estimates on historical experience and other assumptions it believes to be reasonable under the circumstances and evaluates these estimates on an on-going basis. Actual results may differ from these estimates. A discussion of our more significant estimates follows. Management has discussed the development, selection, and disclosure of these estimates and assumptions with the audit committee of the board of directors. Inventory valuation Merchandise inventories are carried at the lower of average cost or market value. Cost is determined using the weighted-average cost method and includes costs incurred to purchase and distribute goods as well as related vendor allowances including co-op advertising, markdowns, and volume discounts. We record valuation adjustments to our inventories if the cost of a specific product on hand exceeds the amount we expect to realize from the ultimate sale or disposal of the inventory. These estimates are based on management judgment regarding future demand, age of inventory, and analysis of historical experience. If actual demand or market conditions are different than those projected by management, future merchandise margin rates may be unfavorably or favorably affected by adjustments to these estimates. Inventories are adjusted for the results of periodic physical inventory counts at each of our locations. We record a shrink reserve representing management estimate of inventory losses by location that have occurred since the date of the last physical count. This estimate is based on management analysis of historical results and operating trends. Adjustments to earnings resulting from revisions to management estimates of the lower of cost or market and shrink reserves have been insignificant during fiscal 2007, 2006 and 2005. Self-insurance We are self-insured for certain losses related to health, workers compensation, and general liability insurance. We maintain stop loss coverage with third-party insurers to limit our liability exposure. Current stop loss coverage is $150,000 for health claims, $100,000 for general liability claims, and $250,000 for workers compensation claims. Management estimates undiscounted loss reserves associated with these liabilities in part by considering historical claims experience, industry factors, and other actuarial assumptions including information provided by third parties. Self-insurance reserves for fiscal 2007, 2006, and 2005 were $2.4 million, $2.3 million and $2.1 million, respectively. Adjustments to earnings resulting from revisions to management estimates of these reserves have been insignificant for fiscal 2007, 2006, and 2005. Impairment of long-lived tangible assets We review long-lived tangible assets whenever events or circumstances indicate these assets might not be recoverable based on undiscounted future cash flows. Assets are reviewed at the lowest level for which cash flows can be identified, which is the store level. Significant estimates are used in determining future operating results of each store over its remaining lease term. If such assets are considered to be impaired, the impairment to be recognized is measured by the amount by which the carrying amount of the assets exceeds the fair value of the assets. We have not recorded an impairment charge in any of the periods presented in the accompanying consolidated financial statements. Share-based compensation Effective January 29, 2006, we adopted the fair value recognition and measurement provisions of Statement of Financial Accounting Standards (SFAS) No. 123(R), Share-Based Payment . Pursuant to SFAS No. 123(R), share-based compensation cost is measured at grant date, based on the fair value of the award, and is recognized as expense over the requisite service period for awards expected to vest. As a non-public entity that previously used the minimum value method for pro forma disclosure purposes under SFAS No. 123, we were required to adopt the prospective method of accounting under SFAS No. 123(R). Under this transitional method, we are required to record compensation expense in the consolidated statements of income for all awards granted after the adoption date and to awards modified, repurchased, or cancelled after the adoption date using the fair value provisions of SFAS No. 123(R). Prior to January 29, 2006, we accounted for share-based awards using the intrinsic value method of accounting in accordance with Accounting Principles Board (APB) Opinion No. 25, Accounting for Stock issued to Employees . Under the provisions of APB Opinion No. 25, no compensation expense was recognized when stock options were granted with exercise prices equal to or greater than market value at the grant date. We estimate the grant date fair value of stock options using a Black-Scholes valuation model. The expected volatility is based on volatilities of a peer group of publicly-traded companies. The risk free interest rate is based on the U.S. Treasury yield curve in effect 38 on the date of grant for the respective expected life of the option. The expected life represents the time the options granted are expected to be outstanding. We have elected to use the shortcut approach in accordance with Staff Accounting Bulletin (SAB) No. 107, Share-Based Payment, to develop the expected life. We recognize compensation cost related to the stock options on a straight-line method over the requisite service period. See Note 9 to our consolidated financial statements, Share-based awards, for disclosure related to our stock compensation expense and related valuation model assumptions. Recent accounting pronouncements In September 2006, the Financial Accounting Standards Board (FASB) issued SFAS No. 157, Fair Value Measurements . SFAS No. 157 defines fair value, establishes a framework for measuring fair value in accordance with U.S. GAAP and expands disclosures about fair value measurements. SFAS No. 157 is effective for financial statements issued for fiscal years beginning after November 15, 2007 for financial assets and liabilities and recurring non-financial assets and liabilities. The FASB has provided a one year deferral for all non-financial and non-recurring assets and liabilities. We do not expect the adoption of SFAS No. 157 to have a material effect on our consolidated financial position or results of operations. In February 2007, the FASB issued SFAS No. 159, The Fair Value Option for Financial Assets and Financial Liabilities . SFAS No. 159 permits all entities to choose to measure eligible items at fair value on specified election dates. The associated unrealized gains and losses on the items for which the fair value option has been elected shall be reported in earnings. SFAS No. 159 is effective for financial statements issued for fiscal years beginning after November 15, 2007. We do not expect the adoption of SFAS No. 159 to have a material effect on our consolidated financial position or results of operations. In December 2007, the Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC) issued SAB No. 110, Simplified Method for Plain Vanilla Share Options . SAB No. 110 amends the views of the SEC staff regarding the use of a simplified method, as discussed in SAB No. 107, in developing an estimate of expected term of plain vanilla share options in accordance with SFAS No. 123(R). In particular, the staff indicated in SAB No. 107 that it will accept a company election to use the simplified method for share option grants prior to December 31, 2007. SAB No. 110 allows public companies which do not have historically sufficient experience to provide a reasonable estimate to continue to use the simplified method for estimating the expected term of plain vanilla share option grants after December 31, 2007. We will continue to use the simplified method until we have enough historical experience to provide a reasonable estimate of the expected term in accordance with SAB No. 110.
