ITEM 7. MANAGEMENT'S DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS OF FINANCIAL CONDITION AND RESULTS OF OPERATIONS The following Management Discussion and Analysis ( MD&A ) is intended to help the reader understand the results of our operations and financial condition. The MD&A is provided as a supplement to, and should be read in conjunction with, our consolidated financial statements and accompanying notes to consolidated financial statements. Where NM is used in various percentage change computations, the computed percentage change has been determined not to be meaningful. Executive overview Results in the businesses in which we operate are highly correlated to the direction of the U.S. equity markets specifically, and more generally, to the overall strength of economic conditions. Overall market conditions, interest rates, economic, political and regulatory trends, and industry competition are among the factors which could affect us and which are unpredictable and beyond our control. These factors affect the financial decisions made by investors, including their level of participation in the financial markets. They also impact the level of underwriting activity, trading profits and asset valuations. In turn, these decisions affect our business results. Year ended September 30, 2011 compared with the year ended September 30, 2010 Our net revenues improved by $417 million, or 14%, to a record $3.3 billion for the year ended September 30, 2011 as compared to the prior year. Non-interest expenses increased $323 million, or 13%, to $2.9 billion, driven primarily by higher variable compensation costs resulting from the increase in commissions, investment banking revenues, and overall firm profitability and the $41 million loss on ARS repurchased, partially offset by a $47 million, or 58%, decrease in the bank loan loss provision. We generated record net income of $278 million, a $50 million, or 22%, improvement over the prior year period. Excluding the loss on ARS repurchased, net of its associated income tax effect, net income would have been $303 million, a 33% increase over the prior year level (a non-GAAP measure). Our financial results during the year were most significantly impacted by: A $58 million, or 36%, increase in the pre-tax income of our PCG segment. This increase resulted from a combination of favorable factors, including the increased activity levels of our private clients due to an improved level of confidence in the equity markets for the first three quarters of the fiscal year, and our continued realization of the benefits of our active recruiting in recent years as evidenced by record financial advisor productivity. A $61 million, or 54%, increase in the pre-tax income generated by RJ Bank. This increase primarily resulted from a significantly lower loan loss provision related to the improved credit quality of our loan portfolio. A $19 million, or 41%, increase in pre-tax income generated by our Asset Management segment. Assets under management increased steadily during the first three quarters of the fiscal year resulting from both increased valuations in the equity markets and the net inflows of client assets. During the fourth quarter, equity markets declined which impacted year end asset levels. However, net inflows for the year were strong, and even though the 4 th quarter equity market decline led to a flat twelve month equity market, year over year assets under management increased 7%. A $6 million, or 7%, decrease in the pre-tax income of our Capital Markets segment. Investment banking revenues in the current fiscal year increased over the prior year; however, results were significantly impacted by decreases in trading profits primarily associated with fixed income securities, decreases in fixed income institutional sales commissions resulting from the unsettled financial markets, especially during the last two quarters of this fiscal year. Further, expenses increased as we made efforts to expand our capital markets business, including the acquisition of Howe Barnes Hoefer and Arnett, Inc. ( Howe Barnes ). Our effective tax rate increased to 39.7% from the prior year rate of 36.9%, primarily resulting from an increase in the average state tax rate component of this blended rate, an increase in certain expenses during the fiscal year which are not deductible for tax purposes, including losses on our company-owned life insurance, and a decrease in the amount of tax credits we realized from our ownership interest in certain low-income housing tax credit partnerships. A pre-tax $41 million loss on ARS repurchased. 30 Based on our review of the Dodd-Frank Act, and because of the nature of our businesses and our business practices, we presently do not expect the legislation to have a significant impact on our operations. However, because many of the regulations will result from further studies and are yet to be adopted by various regulatory agencies, the impact is uncertain. Under the legislation, the OTS was merged into the OCC effective on July 21, 2011, at which time RJF, as the holding company of RJ Bank, became subject to the regulation and oversight of the FRB. RJ Bank application to the OCC to convert its charter to a national bank is still pending. RJF re-filed its application to become a bank holding company at the request of the FRB in November, 2011. We anticipate approval of these applications prior to the end of the calendar year. Upon conversion, RJ Bank will become a national bank and RJF will become a bank holding company. Subsequent to conversion, RJF will elect to become a financial holding company. We have been planning for the change in RJ Bank regulator that occurred during the year, and the upcoming change in RJ Bank charter, for some time. In April, 2011 we completed our acquisition of Howe Barnes. This acquisition reflects our growth strategy to expand both our capital markets and our private client presence in strategic markets. As of the end of our fiscal year the successful integration of the primary businesses of Howe Barnes into our operations has been completed. In April, 2011 we completed a sale of $250 million of 4.25% senior notes, due April 2016. With our resultant liquidity, we believe we are well positioned to execute our growth strategies in each of our core businesses. In June, 2011 we settled the ARS matter with various regulatory agencies by offering to repurchase certain ARS from our clients, or former clients. As of September 30, 2011, we had purchased $245 million par value ARS from current or former clients as a result of this settlement. Prior to September 30, 2011, $16 million of the repurchased ARS were redeemed at par by their issuer. We believe that even though the $41 million pre-tax loss on auction rate securities repurchased was significant, the resolution of the ARS matter was in the best interest of our clients and the firm. With respect to the very near term outlook, we anticipate that market conditions in October and November, 2011 will lead to a more difficult December 2011 quarter. Year ended September 30, 2010 compared with the year ended September 30, 2009 As a result of the improved markets during the year ended September 30, 2010 as compared to the prior year, our net revenues increased by $371 million, or 15%, to $2.9 billion. Non-interest expenses increased by $251 million, or 11%, to $2.6 billion, primarily from higher compensation costs resulting from the increase in commission revenue compared to the prior year, and partially offset by an $89 million, or 53%, decrease in the bank loan loss provision. We generated net income of $228 million, a 49% increase compared to the prior year. Our financial results during the year were most significantly impacted by: A 23% increase in net revenue in our Private Client Group. This increase results primarily from the improved equity markets combined with realization of the benefits of the strong recruiting results in the previous two years. Net interest earnings decreased $79 million, or 20%, resulting predominately from the lower loan balances and lower interest spreads at RJ Bank, coupled with a full year interest expense on our public debt which was issued in August, 2009. Our Asset Management operating results increased as a result of the increase in assets under management from both asset appreciation and net sales. Investment banking activity in our capital markets segment increased significantly, reflecting an increase in the number of underwritings resulting in a $52 million, or 100%, increase in underwriting fees. As a result of the improved equity market conditions, we also realized significantly increased commissions from institutional clients on equity securities which were partially offset by declines in commissions on fixed income products. Trading profits were strong, although did not reach the record level achieved in the prior year. The RJ Bank pre-tax earnings of $112 million reflect a $32 million, or 40%, improvement as compared to the prior year, the net result of lower net interest income and a significantly lower loan loss provision. 31 Our effective tax rate decreased to 37% from the prior year rate of 38.6%, resulting from tax credits we realized from our ownership interest in certain low-income housing tax credit partnerships, certain state and federal tax credits arising from charitable education contributions, and gains on our company-owned life insurance which are non-taxable. Segments The following table presents our consolidated and segment gross revenues and pre-tax income, excluding noncontrolling interests, for the years indicated : Year ended September 30, 2011 2010 2009 (in thousands) Total company Revenues $ 3,399,886 $ 2,979,516 $ 2,602,519 Pre-tax income excluding noncontrolling interests 461,247 361,908 248,774 PCG Revenues 2,185,990 1,903,101 1,557,462 Pre-tax income 218,811 160,470 84,873 Capital Markets Revenues 664,276 591,949 533,254 Pre-tax income 77,990 84,236 73,481 Asset Management Revenues 226,511 196,817 177,359 Pre-tax income 66,176 46,981 30,411 RJ Bank Revenues 281,992 276,770 343,366 Pre-tax income 172,993 112,009 80,011 Emerging Markets Revenues 43,184 16,639 14,891 Pre-tax income (loss) 4,531 (5,446 ) (4,886 ) Securities Lending Revenues 6,432 8,837 10,269 Pre-tax income 1,488 2,721 3,651 Proprietary Capital Revenues 16,805 17,029 12,742 Pre-tax income 4,391 1,728 1,035 Other Revenues 10,524 8,056 7,153 Pre-tax loss (85,133 ) (40,791 ) (19,802 ) Intersegment eliminations Revenues (35,828 ) (39,682 ) (53,977 ) Pre-tax income - - - 32 Net interest analysis We have certain assets and liabilities, not only held in our RJ Bank segment but also held in our PCG and Capital Markets segments, which are subject to changes in interest rates; these changes in interest rates have an impact on our overall financial performance. Given the relationship of our interest sensitive assets to liabilities held in each of these segments, an increase in short-term interest rates would result in an overall increase in our net earnings (we currently have more assets than liabilities with a yield that would be affected by a change in short-term interest rates). Such an increase in short-term interest rates would have the most significant favorable impact on our RJ Bank and PCG segments. The amount of benefit would be dependent upon a variety of factors, including but not limited to the change in balances, the rapidity and magnitude of the increase in rates, and the interest rates paid on client cash balances. The following table presents average balance data and interest income and expense data, as well as the related net interest income: Year Ended September 30, 2011 2010 2009 Average balance Interest inc./exp.

Net interest income is earned primarily by our PCG and RJ Bank segments, which are discussed separately below. In addition to the activity in those segments, our net interest income was negatively impacted during the year ended September 30, 2011 by the $5 million of interest expense associated with our April 2011 issuance of $250 million of 4.25% senior notes. Net interest income in the PCG segment increased $12 million, or 21%, resulting primarily from increased client margin balances and slightly higher interest rates thereon. Interest earned in our Canadian operations increased due to an increase in both interest rates and the balance of segregated assets. RJ Bank net interest income for the year increased $12 million, or 5%, primarily resulting from an increase in net interest margin inclusive of the $6 million first quarter correction of an accumulated interest income understatement in prior years related to purchased residential mortgage loan pools. Refer to the discussion of the specific components of RJ Bank net interest income in the RJ Bank section of this MD&A. Year ended September 30, 2010 compared with the year ended September 30, 2009 Net interest analysis Net interest income decreased $79 million, or 20%, as compared to the prior year. Net interest income is earned primarily by our PCG and RJ Bank segments, which are discussed separately below. In addition, our net interest income was negatively impacted by the $23 million increase in interest expense associated with an entire year of interest on our senior notes, which were issued in August, 2009. RJ Bank net interest income decreased $63 million, or 19%, resulting from a decline in both average interest earning assets and net interest spreads. Refer to the discussion of the specific components of RJ Bank net interest income in the RJ Bank section of this MD&A. Complementing the impact of the implementation of the multi-bank sweep aspect of the RJBDP, which replaced a portion of the foregone interest earnings in the PCG segment with fee income, net interest income in the PCG segment increased $5 million, or 10%, versus the prior year due to higher margin balances and increased net interest spreads on segregated cash. In addition to this increase in net interest income, the PCG segment realized a $33 million increase in fee income generated by the multi-bank sweep aspect of the RJBDP during the year. 34 Results of operations Private Client Group The following table presents consolidated financial information for our PCG segment for the years indicated: Year ended September 30, 2011 % change 2010 % change 2009 ($ in thousands) Revenues: Securities commissions and fees $ 1,817,617 15 % $ 1,585,371 26 % $ 1,262,810 Interest 76,237 21 % 63,128 (4 )% 65,589 Account and service fees: Client account and service fees 123,277 4 % 118,233 38 % 85,957 Mutual fund and annuity service fees 110,281 35 % 81,990 5 % 78,086 Client transaction fees 34,162 (9 )% 37,440 - 37,596 Correspondent clearing fees 3,454 2 % 3,390 (12 )% 3,831 Account and service fees all other 215 26 % 170 795 % 19 Sub-total account and service fees 271,389 13 % 241,223 17 % 205,489 Other 20,747 55 % 13,379 (43 )% 23,574 Total revenues 2,185,990 15 % 1,903,101 22 % 1,557,462 Interest expense 8,741 22 % 7,194 (52 )% 14,891 Net revenues 2,177,249 15 % 1,895,907 23 % 1,542,571 Non-interest expenses: Sales commissions 1,332,207 14 % 1,168,055 26 % 929,202 Admin & incentive compensation and benefit costs 343,097 11 % 310,184 11 % 279,666 Communications and information processing 70,369 17 % 59,974 2 % 58,607 Occupancy and equipment 77,099 - 77,349 (2 )% 79,072 Business development 55,538 13 % 49,126 (11 )% 55,488 Clearance and other 80,468 13 % 71,263 27 % 55,952 Total non-interest expenses 1,958,778 13 % 1,735,951 19 % 1,457,987 Income before taxes and including noncontrolling interests 218,471 37 % 159,956 89 % 84,584 Noncontrolling interests (340 ) (514 ) (289 ) Pre-tax income excluding noncontrolling interests $ 218,811 36 % $ 160,470 89 % $ 84,873 Margin on net revenues 10.0 % 8.5 % 5.5 % Year ended September 30, 2011 compared with the year ended September 30, 2010 Private Client Group Pre-tax income in the PCG segment increased $58 million, or 36%, for the year as compared to the prior year. Net revenues increased $281 million, or 15%. PCG margins were 10% of net revenues compared to 8.5% in the prior year. Securities commissions and fees increased $232 million, or 15%, resulting from a number of favorable factors. Equity market conditions for the first ten months of fiscal year 2011 were improved as compared to the prior year. Asset values increased for most of the year and prior to the decline in the markets commencing in August, 2011, favorably impacting fees arising from client assets in fee-based accounts. Total client assets under administration increased 3% as compared to the prior year end level, to $256 billion. While our number of financial advisors increased only slightly year over year, average financial advisor productivity reached record levels, increasing 15% over the prior year. Average financial advisor productivity increased in both our employee and our independent contractor business models. We are realizing the benefits both from improved market conditions and from the financial advisors that joined us during our very active 2008-2009 recruiting period. Mutual fund and annuity service fees increased $28 million, or 35%, primarily as a result of an increase in mutual fund networking and omnibus fees as well as education and marketing fees, both of which are earned from mutual fund and insurance companies whose products we distribute. During the current year, we have been in the process of changing our data sharing arrangements with many mutual fund companies from networking to an omnibus arrangement. The fees earned from omnibus arrangements are greater than those under networking arrangements in order to compensate us for the additional reporting requirements performed by the broker-dealer under omnibus arrangements. 35 Client transaction fees decreased $3 million, or 9%, primarily as a result of certain mutual fund relationships converting during the current year to a no-transaction fee program. Under this program, we receive increased fees from mutual fund companies which are included within mutual fund and annuity service fee revenue described above, but our clients no longer pay us transaction fees on mutual fund trades within certain of our managed programs. While total segment revenues increased 15%, the portion that we consider to be recurring was consistent with the prior year at 61%. Assets in fee-based accounts at September 30, 2011 increased 11% to $67.5 billion as compared to $60.9 billion in the prior year. Recurring commission and fee revenues include trailing commissions from mutual funds, variable annuities and insurance products, mutual fund service fees and interest. PCG interest revenues increased by $13 million, or 21%, resulting from an increase in client margin balances and a slight increase in the interest rate earned on both customer reserve (segregated assets) balances and client margin balances. Interest earned in our Canadian operations increased due to an increase in both interest rates and customer reserve balances. Other revenues increased by $7 million, or 55%, primarily resulting from a $3 million increase in certain investments held by our Canadian subsidiary and a $2 million increase in foreign currency gains resulting from an increase in cross currency trades executed by our Canadian operation during the year. Sales commission expense increased by $164 million, or 14%, directly related to the 15% increase in commission and fee revenues. Administrative and incentive compensation expenses increased $33 million, or 11%. The increase primarily results from annual increases in salaries and benefits and increases in incentive compensation related to the higher level of profitability. Clearance and other expenses increased $9 million, or 12%, as compared to the prior year. The increase is primarily due to clearance expense which is generally correlated with the increase in securities commissions and fees revenues. Year ended September 30, 2010 compared with the year ended September 30, 2009 Private Client Group PCG pre-tax results increased $76 million, or 89%, as compared to the prior year on an increase of $353 million, or 23%, in net revenues. PCG margins increased to 8.5% of net revenues, a 55% improvement over the prior year. While primarily driven by increased commissions resulting from the realization of the benefits of the strong recruiting results in the previous two years, a combination of market appreciation and an increase in assets under management from new clients also contributed to the strong PCG results. Securities commissions and fees increased $323 million, or 26%. Net commissions, after consideration of sales commission expenses, increased $84 million, or 25%, as compared to the prior year. The net commission expense as a percentage of commission revenues was relatively flat year over year. The number of financial advisors as of September 30, 2010 was also relatively flat as compared to September 30, 2009, but up over 10% since the beginning of fiscal 2008. Recruiting of successful financial advisors and improved market conditions drove a 15% increase in average gross production per financial advisor during the past year. PCG results also include the interest revenue and fees earned on client margin balances and cash segregated for regulatory purposes net of the interest expense paid on client cash balances. The $5 million increase in net interest earnings for the current year as compared to the prior year was complemented by a $33 million increase in financial service fees from the RJBDP, a multi-bank cash sweep program. The increase in these fees was partially offset by a decline in fees received from the sale of money market funds. Interest results are further discussed in the Net Interest section of this MD&A. Non-interest expenses increased $278 million, or 19%, over the prior year. Of this increase, 86% (nearly $239 million) was in sales commission expense, a result of the increase in commission revenues. All of the other components of non-interest expense in aggregate increased by 7.4% over the comparable period. The most significant component of this increase resulted from a $15 million, or 27% increase in Clearance and Other expenses, also driven by the increase in commission and client activity. We incurred expenses arising from a FINRA arbitration panel decision against RJ&A related to a claim of raiding financial advisors. We settled this matter, the impact of which has been reflected in our fiscal year 2010 results. Partially offsetting the increases, business development expense decreased during fiscal year 2010 due to lower recruiting costs than incurred in the prior year. Recruiting was extremely active during fiscal 2008 and 2009 due to consolidation of, and uncertainties arising within, certain of our broker-dealer competitors. 36 Results of operations Capital Markets The following table presents consolidated financial information for our Capital Markets segment for the years indicated: Year ended September 30, 2011 % change 2010 % change 2009 ($ in thousands) Revenues: Institutional sales commissions: Equity $ 250,188 12 % $ 222,481 12 % $ 198,218 Fixed income 125,770 (15 )% 147,585 (15 )% 174,315 Underwriting fees 110,066 23 % 89,216 87 % 47,599 Tax credit funds syndication fees 36,062 141 % 14,941 238 % 4,416 Mergers and acquisitions fees 83,131 44 % 57,783 42 % 40,607 Private placement fees 1,940 1 % 1,914 87 % 1,025 Trading profits 19,981 (37 )% 31,654 (24 )% 41,407 Interest 21,579 19 % 18,191 34 % 13,608 Other 15,559 90 % 8,184 (32 )% 12,059 Total revenues 664,276 12 % 591,949 11 % 533,254 Interest expense 16,612 30 % 12,814 19 % 10,808 Net revenues 647,664 12 % 579,135 11 % 522,446 Non-interest expenses: Sales commissions 127,974 - 128,432 (2 )% 130,463 Admin & incentive compensation and benefit costs 320,209 22 % 262,791 19 % 220,030 Communications and information processing 44,907 18 % 37,925 7 % 35,350 Occupancy and equipment 23,273 19 % 19,575 - 19,565 Business development 34,481 29 % 26,666 19 % 22,500 Clearance and other 41,181 13 % 36,382 (7 )% 39,013 Total non-interest expenses 592,025 16 % 511,771 10 % 466,921 Income before taxes and including noncontrolling interests 55,639 (17 )% 67,364 21 % 55,525 Noncontrolling interests (22,351 ) (16,872 ) (17,956 ) Pre-tax income excluding noncontrolling interests $ 77,990 (7 )% $ 84,236 15 % $ 73,481 Year ended September 30, 2011 compared with the year ended September 30, 2010 Capital Markets Pre-tax income in the Capital Markets segment decreased $6 million, or 7%, for the year as compared to the prior year. Net revenues increased by $69 million, or 12%, primarily resulting from a $28 million, or 12%, increase in institutional equity sales commissions, a $25 million, or 44%, increase in merger and acquisition fees, a $21 million, or 23%, increase in underwriting fees, and a $21 million, or 141%, increase in tax credit fund syndication fees, all of which were partially offset by a $22 million, or 15%, decrease in institutional fixed income commissions and a $12 million, or 37% decrease in trading profits. During recent years we have increased the number of capital markets professionals in both our fixed income and our equity capital markets operations. Our increased revenues in the current year reflect the realization of the benefits of those successful efforts in addition to improved equity markets for most of the year. The increase in institutional equity sales commissions as compared to the prior year is due to a number of favorable factors including favorable equity market conditions for the first ten months of the fiscal year. The decrease in fixed income institutional sales commissions resulted primarily from a flat yield curve and the low interest rate environment. Both lead and co-managed underwritings in our U.S. and Canadian operations increased during the first nine months of the current year. However, market conditions in the fourth quarter were such that IPO activity was non-existent and secondary offering volumes slowed. Even with little fourth quarter activity, we ended the year with increases over the prior year in lead-managed underwritings arising from both our U.S. and our Canadian operations. The number of co-managed underwritings arising from our Canadian operations increased 32% while co-managed underwritings from our U.S. operations decreased 4%, as compared to the prior year. 37 The increase in merger and acquisition fees resulted primarily from increases in our business services, technology, energy, consumer and retail, and transportation and industrial growth business sectors. The increase in tax credit fund syndication fees resulted from a 66% increase in the volume of tax credit fund equity investments sold to investors, to $616 million from $371 million in the prior year. The decrease in trading profits from the prior year is primarily related to fixed income products, and to a lesser extent, an increase in facilitation losses from our equity market making activities. Trading profits for the first nine months of the year were relatively strong in what was for the most part unsettled fixed income markets caused by issues during that period such as those related to the U.S. debt ceiling. The increased levels of uncertainty in the markets resulting from solvency problems in several European countries during the fourth quarter resulted in us generating a net trading loss during that period. In addition, the facilitation losses increased due to the fourth quarter decline in the equity markets. Other revenues increased $7 million, or 90%, primarily resulting from increases in revenues and the avoidance of certain losses incurred in the prior year, associated with our tax credit fund syndication activities. Non-interest expenses increased $80 million, or 16%. Administrative and incentive compensation expense increased $57 million, or 22%, as a result of a number of factors including the incremental growth in the number of fixed income investment bankers, an increase in equity capital markets investment bankers in part arising from the Howe Barnes acquisition, increases in incentive compensation as a result of the increased revenues of the segment, increased expenses resulting from the consolidation of Raymond James European Securities, S.A.S. ( RJES ), a subsidiary in which we acquired a controlling interest effective April 4, 2011, and certain one-time expenses incurred during the current year as a result of the Howe Barnes acquisition. Business development expense increased $8 million, or 29%, with increases in both our domestic and Canadian capital markets groups reflecting our efforts to expand these businesses in light of what had been improving market outlooks for the better part of the current year. Noncontrolling interests reflect the impact of consolidating certain low-income housing tax credit funds, which impact other revenue, interest expense, and other expenses within this segment (see Note 9 of the Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements for further details) as well as the impact of RJES, initially consolidated in the June 2011 quarter. Noncontrolling interests reflect the portion of these businesses that we do not own. Year ended September 30, 2010 compared with the year ended September 30, 2009 Capital Markets Capital Markets pre-tax results increased $11 million, or 15%, with net revenues increasing $57 million, or 11%, as compared to the prior year. We realized significant increases in underwriting fees of $52 million, or 100%, mergers and acquisition fees of $17 million, or 42%, and commissions from institutional equity sales of $24 million, or 12%. These increases were offset by a decrease in fixed income sales commissions of $27 million, or 15%, and trading profits, which are primarily related to fixed income products and declined in comparison to the prior year by $10 million, or 24%. Despite the unfavorable comparison, trading profits were historically strong, although slightly below the record level experienced in the prior year. The number of lead and co-managed underwritings during the year were up 76% and 32%, respectively, as compared to the prior year, a time when underwritings were down dramatically due to the then-existing market conditions. The dramatically improved equity market conditions in the current year versus the prior year were conducive to generating the increased equity market commissions, merger and acquisition fees and underwriting fees. Our increased merger and acquisition activity arose primarily from engagements by companies in the healthcare, business services and energy sectors. Non-interest expenses increased $45 million, or 10%, primarily resulting from compensation related costs. The current year includes the addition of investment bankers added in our acquisition of Lane Berry International, Inc., which occurred in the third quarter of fiscal year 2009, and increased incentive compensation resulting from the increased profitability in our equity capital markets business. Noncontrolling interests represent the impact of consolidating certain low-income housing tax credit funds and impact other revenue, interest expense, and other expenses in this segment (See Note 9 of the Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements for further details). 38 Results of operations Asset Management The following table presents consolidated financial information for the Asset Management segment for the years indicated: Year ended September 30, 2011 % change 2010 % change 2009 ($ in thousands) Revenues: Investment advisory fees $ 188,817 21 % $ 156,266 16 % $ 135,223 Other 37,694 (7 )% 40,551 (4 )% 42,136 Total revenues 226,511 15 % 196,817 11 % 177,359 Expenses: Admin & incentive compensation and benefit costs 76,594 10 % 69,931 13 % 61,907 Communications and information processing 15,307 (16 )% 18,116 (9 )% 19,890 Occupancy and equipment 3,670 (6 )% 3,904 (1 )% 3,929 Business development 7,365 18 % 6,254 6 % 5,893 Investment sub-advisory fees 27,606 12 % 24,701 16 % 21,314 Other 28,392 10 % 25,840 (24 )% 33,891 Total expenses 158,934 7 % 148,746 1 % 146,824 Income before taxes and including noncontrolling interests 67,577 41 % 48,071 57 % 30,535 Noncontrolling interests 1,401 1,090 124 Pre-tax income excluding noncontrolling interests $ 66,176 41 % $ 46,981 54 % $ 30,411 The following table presents assets under management and the non-managed fee-based assets that significantly impact segment results at the dates indicated: September 30, 2011 % change 2010 % change 2009 ($ in thousands) Assets under management: Eagle Asset Management, Inc. $ 16,091,575 3 % $ 15,566,954 15 % $ 13,582,832 Eagle money market funds - - % - (100 )% 2,966,819 Raymond James Consulting Services 8,356,269 (1 )% 8,458,178 8 % 7,833,081 Unified managed accounts 1,676,737 128 % 734,750 197 % 247,721 Freedom accounts & other managed programs 9,523,430 8 % 8,791,332 21 % 7,256,673 Total assets under management 35,648,011 6 % 33,551,214 5 % 31,887,126 Less: assets managed for affiliated entities (3,578,662 ) 1 % (3,544,197 ) 18 % (3,008,675 ) Net assets under management $ 32,069,349 7 % $ 30,007,017 4 % $ 28,878,451 Non-managed fee-based assets: Passport $ 24,008,105 6 % $ 22,707,602 17 % $ 19,451,710 Ambassador 13,554,913 29 % 10,479,432 43 % 7,327,402 Other non-managed fee-based assets 2,196,199 9 % 2,022,785 21 % 1,671,029 Total $ 39,759,217 13 % $ 35,209,819 24 % $ 28,450,141 The majority of the revenue for this segment is generated by the investment advisory fees related to asset management services for individual investment portfolios, mutual funds and managed programs. As of September 30, 2011, approximately 82% of investment advisory fees are earned from assets held in managed programs. Historically, approximately 70% of our investment advisory fees recorded in a quarter are determined based on balances at the beginning of a quarter, approximately 15% are based on balances at the end of the quarter and the remaining 15% are computed based on average assets throughout the quarter. Asset balances are impacted by both the performance of the market and the new sales and redemptions of client accounts/funds. Increasing markets positively impact revenues from investment advisory fees as existing accounts increase in value, and individuals and institutions typically commit incremental funds in rising markets. 39 Year ended September 30, 2011 compared with the year ended September 30, 2010 Asset Management Pre-tax income in the Asset Management segment increased $19 million, or 41%, as compared to the prior year. Investment advisory fees increased by $33 million, or 21%, from the prior year, generated by an increase in assets under management. Assets under management increased during the current fiscal year by $2.1 billion, comprised of $3.3 billion of new client assets net of a market value decrease of $1.2 billion. Our investment advisory fee revenues for the year benefitted from appreciation in the market values of assets in each of the first three quarters of the fiscal year, with the entire decrease in market values occurring during the fourth quarter. As a result of the nature in which our fee revenues are computed, this decline will impact the first quarter fiscal year 2012 fees more than it impacted our fiscal year 2011 results. Expenses increased by $10 million, or 7%, primarily resulting from a $7 million, or 10%, increase in administrative and incentive compensation, and a $3 million, or 12%, increase in investment sub-advisory fee expenses. Increases in incentive compensation are highly correlated with revenues, portfolio performance and segment profitability. The investment sub-advisory fee expense increase results from the increase in assets held in accounts managed by sub-advisors. Communications and information processing expense decreased $3 million, or 16%, while other expense increased $3 million, or 10%, both of which result from the utilization of a third-party transfer agent for the Eagle family of mutual funds during the current year. These outsourced services were performed internally during the prior year. Year ended September 30, 2010 compared with the year ended September 30, 2009 Asset Management Asset Management pre-tax results increased $17 million, or 54%, and total revenues increased $20 million, or 11%, as compared to the prior year. The increase in revenues resulted from a combination of favorable factors including increased market values, additional client investments and $3 million in performance fees. Net assets under management increased by $1.1 billion, or 4%, the net impact of market appreciation and asset flows during the year. We experienced net asset inflows of $2.4 billion into managed accounts from both new clients and clients re-entering the market after the downturn. Non-managed fee-based assets increased $6.8 billion, or 24%, as compared to the prior year primarily due to positive net inflows of approximately $5.4 billion. These revenue increases were partially offset by an $8 million decrease in money market fund fees in the current year ($14 million less in money market management fees net of a $6 million reduction in money market fee waivers). The money market funds were impacted by lower balances and lower interest rates and the resulting spread compression. There were $3 billion in net money market account outflows due to the implementation of the multi-bank sweep aspect of the RJBDP in September, 2009 and the subsequent transfer of the internally managed money market funds to a third-party advisor in August, 2010. Eagle class shares of both a taxable and a tax-exempt money market fund are available to clients of Eagle and its affiliates through the third-party advisor. Increases in compensation costs and investment sub-advisory fee expense were directly correlated to the increase in investment sub-advisory fee revenues. Other expense decreased $8 million, or 24%, primarily due to the reduction in costs associated with the money market funds. As money market fund balances decreased, distribution fees paid to the PCG segment declined and there was a reduction in the money market management fee shared with the PCG segment due to the money market fee waivers. 40 Results of operations RJ Bank The following table presents consolidated financial information for RJ Bank for the years indicated: Year ended September 30, 2011 % change 2010 % change 2009 ($ in thousands) Revenues: Interest income $ 284,640 2 % $ 278,326 (20 )% $ 349,110 Interest expense 13,334 (29 )% 18,761 (30 )% 26,717 Net interest income 271,306 5 % 259,565 (19 )% 322,393 Other loss (2,648 ) (70 )% (1,556 ) 73 % (5,744 ) Net revenues 268,658 4 % 258,009 (19 )% 316,649 Non-interest expenses: Employee compensation and benefits 14,968 30 % 11,488 10 % 10,425 Communications and information processing 2,402 42 % 1,687 9 % 1,552 Occupancy and equipment 842 (4 )% 873 (9 )% 956 Provision for loan losses 33,655 (58 )% 80,413 (53 )% 169,341 FDIC insurance premiums 8,855 (21 )% 11,206 (30 )% 15,955 Affiliate deposit account servicing fees 20,733 (7 )% 22,245 (11 )% 25,020 Other 14,210 (21 )% 18,088 35 % 13,389 Total non-interest expenses 95,665 (34 )% 146,000 (38 )% 236,638 Pre-tax income $ 172,993 54 % $ 112,009 40 % $ 80,011 RJ Bank is a federally chartered savings bank, regulated by the OCC, which provides corporate, residential and consumer loans, as well as FDIC insured deposit accounts, to clients of our broker-dealer subsidiaries and to the general public. RJ Bank is active in corporate loan syndications and bank participations as well as purchases residential whole loan packages to hold for investment. RJ Bank generates revenue principally through the interest income earned on loans and investments, which is offset by the interest expense and fees it pays on client deposits and on its borrowings. 41 The tables below present certain credit quality trends for corporate loans and residential/consumer loans: Year ended September 30, 2011 2010 2009 (in thousands) Net loan charge-offs: C&I loans $ (458 ) $ - $ - CRE construction loans - - (3,222 ) CRE loans (13,534 ) (54,053 ) (77,316 ) Residential/mortgage loans (20,757 ) (29,548 ) (26,686 ) Consumer loans (246 ) - - Total $ (34,995 ) $ (83,601 ) $ (107,224 ) As of September 30, 2011 2010 2009 (in thousands) Allowance for loan losses: Loans held for sale $ 5 $ 23 $ 7 Loans held for investment: C&I loans 81,267 60,464 84,841 CRE construction loans 490 4,473 3,237 CRE loans 30,752 47,771 34,018 Residential/mortgage loans 33,210 34,297 28,081 Consumer loans 20 56 88 Total $ 145,744 $ 147,084 $ 150,272 Nonperforming assets: Nonperforming loans: C& I loans $ 25,685 $ - $ - CRE loans 15,842 67,901 86,422 Residential mortgage loans: Residential mortgage loans 91,682 85,852 71,849 Home equity loans/lines 114 230 111 Total nonperforming loans 133,323 153,983 158,382 Other real estate owned: CRE 7,707 19,486 4,646 Residential: First mortgage 6,852 8,439 4,045 Home equity 13 - - Total other real estate owned 14,572 27,925 8,691 Total nonperforming assets $ 147,895 $ 181,908 $ 167,073 Total loans: Loans held for sale, net (1) $ 102,236 $ 6,114 $ 40,484 Loans held for investment: C&I loans 4,100,939 3,232,723 3,079,916 CRE construction loans 29,087 65,512 163,951 CRE loans 742,889 937,669 1,080,160 Residential/mortgage loans 1,756,486 2,015,331 2,396,995 Consumer loans 7,438 23,940 22,816 Net unearned income and deferred expenses (45,417 ) (39,276 ) (40,077 ) Total loans held for investment 6,591,422 6,235,899 6,703,761 Total loans $ 6,693,658 $ 6,242,013 $ 6,744,245 (1) Net of unearned income and deferred expenses. 42 Year ended September 30, 2011 compared with the year ended September 30, 2010 RJ Bank Pre-tax income generated by the RJ Bank segment increased $61 million, or 54%, for the year compared to the prior year. The significant improvement in pre-tax income was attributable to a $47 million, or 58%, decrease in the provision for loan losses and an increase of $12 million, or 5%, in net interest income. The increase in net interest income is primarily due to an increase of 0.12% in the net interest margin. The net interest margin improvement for the year resulted from an increase in the loan portfolio yield from 3.97% to 4.25% due primarily to an increase in corporate loan yields and a $6 million correction of an accumulated interest income understatement in prior years related to purchased residential mortgage loan pools. Yields on the residential mortgage loan portfolio declined during the year due to adjustable rate loans resetting to lower rates and the payoff of higher yielding loans in the current low interest rate environment. Average interest-earning banking assets increased $44 million, or less than 1%, and totaled $7.8 billion at year end. An increase in average C&I loans and significant increases in cash balances were offset by a decrease in the other loan portfolio segments. Corresponding to the small increase in average interest-earning banking assets, average interest-bearing banking liabilities increased less than 1% to $7 billion at year end. Continued low interest rates led to a $5 million, or 29%, decrease in interest expense. The average cost of funds decreased from 0.27% to 0.19%. However, excluding the impact of excess RJBDP cash balances held during the fourth quarter, the net interest margin would have increased by 0.26% over the prior year. These deposits resulted from higher cash balances in our client accounts due to the market volatility, thus exceeding the RJBDP capacity at outside financial institutions in the program. These deposits were invested in short term liquid investments producing very little interest rate spread. The provision for loan losses of $34 million for the current year was significantly lower than the $80 million in the prior year and net loan charge-offs for the year decreased $49 million, or 58%, from $84 million to $35 million. These declines are a result of an improvement in credit quality within the CRE portfolio, an improvement in the credit characteristics of certain problem corporate loans, and the stabilization of the balance of residential mortgage nonperforming loans. However, unfavorable economic conditions, including high unemployment rates, continue to have a negative impact on the residential mortgage loan portfolio. The amount of nonperforming loans decreased $21 million, or 13%, during the year compared to the prior year. This decrease was due to a reduction of $52 million in nonperforming CRE loans, partially offset by an increase of $26 million in C&I nonperforming loans and an increase of $6 million in nonperforming residential mortgage loans. Other real estate owned decreased $13 million, or 48%, to $15 million at year end due to the net sales of $12 million in CRE properties and $1 million in residential properties. The unrealized loss on our available for sale securities portfolio was $46 million, compared to $51 million as of the prior year end. The unrealized loss was due to continued wide interest rate spreads across market sectors related to the continued uncertainty in the residential non-agency CMO market. Certain securities were determined to be other-than-temporarily impaired ( OTTI ) during the year as RJ Bank does not expect to recover the amortized cost basis of the securities in full, and therefore an OTTI expense of $10 million was reflected in fiscal year 2011 as a component of other loss, compared to a $12 million OTTI charge in the prior fiscal year. On June 30, 2011, RJ Bank announced that it entered into a definitive agreement to acquire substantially all of a foreign bank Canadian corporate loan portfolio. This loan portfolio consists of approximately $615 million in loan commitments, of which approximately $500 million is outstanding. The loans we are purchasing are comprised of CRE and C&I loans as well as project finance loans in the power and infrastructure sector. The transaction is subject to U.S. regulatory approval, which is currently in process in conjunction with RJ Bank application to convert to a national bank charter. 43 Year ended September 30, 2010 compared with the year ended September 30, 2009 RJ Bank Pre-tax income generated by RJ Bank increased $32 million, or 40%, as compared to the prior year as a result of an $89 million decrease in the provision for loan losses exceeding a $59 million, or 19%, decrease in net revenues. Net revenues decreased primarily due to a decrease in net interest income resulting from a decline in both average interest-earning banking assets and the net interest margin. The average yield on the loan portfolio decreased from 4.24% to 3.97% due to continued low market rates. Average loans outstanding decreased $1.1 billion, or 14%, from $7.5 billion to $6.4 billion as a result of our strategy during fiscal year 2009 to reduce loans outstanding in order to strengthen our capital position. However, loans outstanding have continued to decline during the current year as loan repayments have exceeded new loan growth. Corresponding to the decrease in average loans, average deposits decreased $1.4 billion, or 17%, from $8.3 billion to $6.9 billion. The reduced deposit balances combined with lower interest rates led to an $8 million, or 30%, decrease in interest expense. The average cost of funds decreased from 0.32% to 0.27%. The provision for loan losses continues to be impacted by certain unfavorable economic conditions including depressed real estate values and high unemployment rates. The primary factors contributing to the provision for loan losses during the current year were increased delinquencies in the residential mortgage loan portfolio, continued relatively high levels of nonperforming corporate loans, increased reserve rates for criticized CRE loans and, to a lesser extent, the stratification of the performing residential mortgage loan portfolio based upon updated loan to value ( LTV ) estimates with higher reserve percentages allocated to the higher LTV loans. The large prior year provision was primarily attributable to increased reserves and charge-offs due to the rapid deterioration of the credit markets, a significant decline in commercial real estate values, an increase in projected loss experience on residential mortgage loans, and included the charge-off of one $28 million corporate loan. Net loan charge-offs for the year totaled $84 million compared to $107 million for the prior year. Charge-offs during the current year were taken almost exclusively on commercial and residential real estate loans. Corporate charge-offs decreased $26 million due to improved portfolio credit characteristics, partially offset by a $3 million increase in residential/consumer charge-offs as compared to the prior year, which resulted from the continued high level of residential delinquencies and declines in home values in many markets. The amount of nonperforming loans decreased $4 million, or 3%, as compared to the prior year. Corporate nonperforming loans decreased $18 million primarily due to improved corporate loan portfolio credit characteristics. This improvement in corporate nonperforming loans was partially offset by an increase of $14 million in nonperforming residential mortgage loans due to the ongoing economic impact on residential mortgage delinquencies. However, the growth in total delinquent residential mortgage loans (30+ days or more delinquent) has slowed substantially with an increase of $3 million for this year compared to a $61 million increase in the prior year. Other real estate owned increased from $9 million to $28 million due to foreclosures of CRE properties and an increase in the pace of residential foreclosures. As of September 30, 2010, the unrealized loss on our available for sale securities portfolio was $51 million, compared to $98 million as of September 30, 2009. The unrealized loss was due to continued wide interest rate spreads across market sectors related to the continued uncertainty in the residential non-agency CMOs market. Certain securities were determined to be OTTI during the year because RJ Bank does not expect to recover the amortized cost basis of the securities in full, and therefore, an OTTI expense of $12 million was reflected in fiscal year 2010 as a component of other loss, compared to a $13 million OTTI charge in fiscal year 2009. Overall, the decrease in other loss for the year as compared to the prior year is mostly attributable to a $2 million gain on the sale of equity received in a loan settlement and a reduction in OTTI losses related to our available for sale securities portfolio. 44 The following table presents average balance data and interest income and expense data for our banking operations, as well as the related interest yields and rates and interest spread for the years indicated: Year ended September 30, 2011 2010 2009 Average balance Interest inc./exp.

(2) Negotiable Order of Withdrawal ( NOW ) account. (3) During the December 2010 quarter end, RJ Bank reclassified certain average loan balances to more closely align these balances with its assignment of credit risk utilized within the allowance for loan losses evaluation. As a result, the average loan balances, related interest income and the respective yield calculations presented above differ from those previously reported. Increases and decreases in interest income and interest expense result from changes in average balances (volume) of interest-earning banking assets and liabilities, as well as changes in average interest rates. The following table shows the effect that these factors had on the interest earned on RJ Bank's interest-earning assets and the interest incurred on its interest-bearing liabilities. The effect of changes in volume is determined by multiplying the change in volume by the previous year's average yield/cost. Similarly, the effect of rate changes is calculated by multiplying the change in average yield/cost by the previous year's volume. Changes applicable to both volume and rate have been allocated proportionately. 46 Year ended September 30, 2011 compared to 2010 2010 compared to 2009 Increase (decrease) due to Increase (decrease) due to Volume Rate Total Volume Rate Total (in thousands) Interest revenue: Interest-earning banking assets: Loans, net of unearned income: Loans held for sale $ (183 ) $ (192 ) $ (375 ) $ 818 $ (282 ) $ 536 Loans held for investment C&I loans 15,853 21,289 37,142 21,417 (4,856 ) 16,561 CRE construction loans (390 ) 286 (104 ) (6,754 ) (301 ) (7,055 ) CRE loans (5,978 ) 3,458 (2,520 ) (30,879 ) (2,086 ) (32,965 ) Residential mortgage loans (1) (16,077 ) (12,068 ) (28,145 ) (26,342 ) (12,958 ) (39,300 ) Consumer loans (295 ) (11 ) (306 ) 40 4 44 Reverse repurchase agreements (147 ) - (147 ) (919 ) (255 ) (1,174 ) Agency MBS (412 ) (128 ) (540 ) (586 ) (1,390 ) (1,976 ) Non-agency CMOs (4,018 ) (2,481 ) (6,499 ) (4,357 ) (194 ) (4,551 ) Money market funds, cash and cash equivalents 1,454 (615 ) 839 1,372 (2,460 ) (1,088 ) FHLB stock and other 244 348 592 454 (270 ) 184 Total interest-earning banking assets (9,949 ) 9,886 (63 ) (45,736 ) (25,048 ) (70,784 ) Interest expense: Interest-bearing banking liabilities: Deposits: Certificates of deposit 684 (1,019 ) (335 ) (241 ) (1,425 ) (1,666 ) Money market, savings and NOW accounts 91 (3,204 ) (3,113 ) (2,806 ) (3,498 ) (6,304 ) FHLB advances and other (1,576 ) (403 ) (1,979 ) 779 (765 ) 14 Total interest-bearing banking liabilities (801 ) (4,626 ) (5,427 ) (2,268 ) (5,688 ) (7,956 ) Change in net interest income $ (9,148 ) $ 14,512 $ 5,364 $ (43,468 ) $ (19,360 ) $ (62,828 ) (1) Adjusted to exclude a $6 million December 2010 quarter end correction of an accumulated interest income understatement in prior periods related to purchased residential mortgage loan pools. 47 Results of operations Emerging Markets The following table presents consolidated financial information of our Emerging Markets segment for the period indicated: Year ended September 30, 2011 % change 2010 % change 2009 ($ in thousands) Revenues: Securities commissions and fees $ 10,736 61 % $ 6,677 8 % $ 6,163 Investment banking 19,755 NM 324 (68 )% 999 Investment advisory fees 6,544 55 % 4,213 211 % 1,355 Interest income 1,383 310 % 337 (77 )% 1,456 Trading profits 4,249 (9 )% 4,657 3 % 4,531 Other income 517 20 % 431 11 % 387 Total revenues 43,184 160 % 16,639 12 % 14,891 Interest expense 184 (25 )% 244 (42 )% 421 Net revenues 43,000 162 % 16,395 13 % 14,470 Non-interest expenses: Compensation expense 26,185 74 % 15,077 5 % 14,381 Other expense 11,048 43 % 7,699 6 % 7,296 Total non-interest expenses 37,233 63 % 22,776 5 % 21,677 Income (loss) before taxes and including noncontrolling interests 5,767 190 % (6,381 ) 11 % (7,207 ) Noncontrolling interests 1,236 (935 ) (2,321 ) Pre-tax income (loss) excluding noncontrolling interests $ 4,531 183 % $ (5,446 ) (11 )% $ (4,886 ) The Emerging Markets segment includes the results from our joint ventures in Latin America including Argentina, Uruguay and Brazil. Year ended September 30, 2011 compared with the year ended September 30, 2010 Emerging Markets Pre-tax income in the Emerging Markets segment increased $10 million, or 183%, for the year. Net revenues increased by $27 million, or 162%, resulting from increased investment banking fee revenue of $19 million, increased securities commissions and fees of $4 million, and increased investment advisory fees of $2 million. The investment banking fee revenues primarily result from our Argentine joint venture, which provided advisory services to institutional clients in several significant transactions during the current year. The increase in securities commissions and fees results in large part from successful recruiting efforts by two of our Latin American joint venture entities during fiscal year 2010. The increase in investment advisory fees results from growth in our Argentine asset management venture, which has realized 15% growth in assets under management as compared to the prior year. Non-interest expenses increased $14 million, or 63%, primarily resulting from higher compensation expense associated with the increased investment banking activity. Year ended September 30, 2010 compared with the year ended September 30, 2009 Emerging Markets Emerging Markets in fiscal 2010 consists of the results of our joint ventures in Latin America, including Argentina, Uruguay and Brazil. Net results in the emerging markets segment declined $560,000, or 11%, as compared to the prior year. The operating results of the segment before allocation between us and our joint venture partners improved $826,000 as compared to the prior year. Investment advisory fees increased $2.9 million as our Argentine asset management venture continues to grow its assets under management, these assets increased 153% as compared to the prior year. Net interest income decreased $942,000 and non-interest expenses increased $1.1 million, primarily resulting from higher compensation expenses arising from the increase in fee income. Offsetting this net improvement in overall operating results was a $1.4 million increase in the amount of losses attributable to our ownership interest. 48 Results of operations Securities Lending The following table presents consolidated financial information of our Securities Lending segment for the periods indicated: Year ended September 30, 2011 % change 2010 % change 2009 ($ in thousands) Interest income and expense: Interest income $ 6,035 (29 )% $ 8,448 (18 )% $ 10,269 Interest expense 1,807 (49 )% 3,530 (8 )% 3,838 Net interest income 4,228 (14 )% 4,918 (24 )% 6,431 Other income 397 2 % 389 NM - Net revenues 4,625 (13 )% 5,307 (17 )% 6,431 Non-interest expenses 3,137 21 % 2,586 (7 )% 2,780 Pre-tax income $ 1,488 (45 )% $ 2,721 (25 )% $ 3,651 Year ended September 30, 2011 compared with the year ended September 30, 2010 Securities Lending Pre-tax income generated by this segment decreased by $1 million, or 45%, for the year. Net interest income decreased by $700,000, or 14%, resulting primarily from decreases in our Box lending activities, but also including to a lesser extent, decreases in our Matched Book activities. In both our Box lending and Matched Book activities, our net interest spread and our average balances outstanding decreased. Year ended September 30, 2010 compared with the year ended September 30, 2009 Securities Lending The net results in the Securities Lending segment decreased $930,000, or 25%, as compared to the prior year. Securities Lending revenues declined 14%, with net revenues declining 17% as compared to the prior year. In the Matched Book activities, both gross interest revenue and expense declined due to decreasing average balances which were partially offset by improved margins. The decrease in Matched Book activity results from reduced transaction volumes. Box lending increased significantly, however the margin realized from this activity was also significantly less than the prior year. The decrease in the margin resulted primarily from the change in the mix of securities that were loaned this fiscal year as compared to the prior year. 49 Results of operations Proprietary Capital The following table presents consolidated financial information for the Propriety Capital segment for the years indicated: Year ended September 30, 2011 % change 2010 % change 2009 ($ in thousands) Revenues: Interest (1) $ 473 (76 )% $ 1,953 1029 % $ 173 Investment advisory fees 950 (14 )% 1,100 9 % 1,013 Other 15,382 10 % 13,976 21 % 11,556 Total revenues 16,805 (1 )% 17,029 34 % 12,742 Expenses: Compensation expense 2,151 21 % 1,785 (12 )% 2,037 Other expenses 711 (65 )% 2,051 28 % 1,603 Total expenses 2,862 (25 )% 3,836 5 % 3,640 Income before taxes and including noncontrolling interests 13,943 6 % 13,193 45 % 9,102 Noncontrolling interests 9,552 11,465 8,067 Pre-tax income excluding noncontrolling interests $ 4,391 154 % $ 1,728 67 % $ 1,035 (1) Includes dividends received. The Proprietary Capital segment results are substantially determined by the valuations within Raymond James Capital Partners, L.P. ( Capital Partners ), Raymond James Employee Investment Funds I and II (the EIF Funds ), and the valuations of our direct merchant banking investments and our investments in third-party private equity funds (the Third-Party Private Funds ). As of September 30, 2011, our merchant banking investments, at fair value, include a $16 million investment in a manufacturer of crime investigation and forensic supplies (the Forensic Supply Company ), an $18 million indirect investment (through Capital Partners) in an allergy immunotherapy testing and treatment supply company (the Allergy Company ), and a $21 million investment in an event photography business. Year ended September 30, 2011 compared with the year ended September 30, 2010 Proprietary Capital Pre-tax income generated by this segment increased by $3 million, or 154%, for the year as compared to the prior year. In the current year, the results consists of the increase in the net valuation of the Third-Party Private Funds of $6 million, the increase in revenue pertaining to the Allergy Company of $8 million (which include both dividends received and a valuation increase), a $4 million increase in the value of our event photography business, and $4 million of valuation increases in the EIF Funds, all of which are partially offset by a $5 million write-down in the value of our Forensic Supply Company investment. In the prior year, the revenue arose primarily from the dividends from and valuation investment increase of the Allergy Company of $12 million and valuation increases in the Third-Party Private Funds of $3 million. Total expenses have decreased nearly $1 million in the current year as compared to the prior year. The prior year included nearly $2 million of expenses related to due diligence activities which did not recur in the current year. The portion of this year revenue attributable to noncontrolling interests decreased by nearly $2 million. The majority of the Allergy Company and the EIF Fund investments are held by others; therefore, a reduction in the portion of our revenues attributable to those investments results in a lower attribution of income to others. The revenues from those investments decreased by $3 million in the current year. Year ended September 30, 2010 compared with the year ended September 30, 2009 Proprietary Capital Pre-tax income generated by this segment increased $693,000, or 67%, as compared to the prior year. This net increase is a result of the increase in the value of our investments coupled with the increase in dividends received during the year, a combined $4 million in additional revenue over the prior year. Our expenses were well controlled and approximated the prior year level. The portion of the increases in the value of the investments and the interest and dividends received, as described above, that are attributable to other investors and are therefore not ours, increased by $3 million. 50 The results for fiscal 2010 include an $11 million increase in the value of our Capital Partners portfolio and $2 million in dividends received on these investments. Our third-party private equity fund investments and the EIF Funds portfolio increased in value by $4 million. Partially offsetting these increases was a $600,000 decrease in the value of our direct merchant banking investments. Since we do not own 100% of all of these investments, $11 million of the increases described above are attributable to other investors and are included within noncontrolling interests. Results of operations Other The following table presents consolidated financial information for the Other segment for the years indicated: Year ended September 30, 2011 % change 2010 % change 2009 ($ in thousands) Revenues: Interest income $ 8,086 29 % $ 6,269 (17 )% $ 7,597 Other 2,438 36 % 1,787 NM (444 ) Total revenues 10,524 31 % 8,056 13 % 7,153 Interest expense 31,374 20 % 26,113 462 % 4,647 Net revenues (20,850 ) (15 )% (18,057 ) NM 2,506 Loss on auction rate securities repurchased 41,391 - - - - Other expense 22,892 1 % 22,734 2 % 22,308 Total non-interest expenses 64,283 183 % 22,734 2 % 22,308 Pre-tax loss $ (85,133 ) (109 )% $ (40,791 ) (106 )% $ (19,802 ) Year ended September 30, 2011 compared with the year ended September 30, 2010 Other Pre-tax loss generated by this segment increased by $44 million, or 109%, for the year as compared to the prior year. Total revenues in the current year increased by $2 million, or 31%, as compared to the prior year. The revenue increases result primarily from increases in the value of certain investments, some of which were sold during the current year and resulted in realized gains, and an increase in interest income as a result of increases in parent company cash balances. Interest expense in the current year increased $5 million, or 20%, as compared to the prior year primarily as a result of additional interest expense associated with the April 4, 2011 issuance of $250 million of 4.25% senior notes due April, 2016. The segment includes the loss on auction rate securities repurchased. Refer to the discussion of the ARS matter in Item 3 Legal Proceedings and information on the securities held in our ARS portfolio in Notes 3 and 5 of our Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements. Year ended September 30, 2010 compared with the year ended September 30, 2009 Other Pre-tax loss arising from this segment increased $21 million, or 106%, for the year as compared to the prior year. This decrease was driven by the interest expense on our senior debt issued in August, 2009. Annual interest expense on this debt is $26 million. The increase over the prior year is because the prior year included approximately two months of this interest expense, as compared to a full year of interest expense in fiscal 2010. Total revenues increased by approximately $900,000, or 13%, as compared to the prior year primarily due to a $3 million increase in the value of certain investments. This increase was partially offset by a decrease in interest earnings on cash of $1 million, and $2 million fewer proceeds from company-owned life insurance which is held as a funding vehicle for non-qualified deferred compensation programs. 51 Liquidity and capital resources Liquidity is essential to our business. The primary goal of our liquidity management activities is to ensure adequate funding to conduct our business over a range of market environments. Senior management establishes our liquidity and capital policies. These policies include senior management review of short- and long-term cash flow forecasts, review of monthly capital expenditures, the monitoring of the availability of alternative sources of financing, and the daily monitoring of liquidity in our significant subsidiaries. Our decisions on the allocation of capital to our business units consider, among other factors, projected profitability and cash flow, risk and impact on future liquidity needs. Our treasury department assists in evaluating, monitoring and controlling the impact that our business activities have on our financial condition, liquidity and capital structure as well as maintains our relationships with various lenders. The objectives of these policies are to support the successful execution of our business strategies while ensuring ongoing and sufficient liquidity. Liquidity is provided primarily through our business operations and financing activities. Financing activities could include bank borrowings, repurchase agreement transactions or additional capital raising activities under our universal shelf registration. Cash provided by operating activities during the year ended September 30, 2011 was $1.6 billion, mainly driven by an increase in cash resulting from our successful operating results for the year, an increase in brokerage client payables and other accounts payable, an increase in stock loaned (net of stock borrowed), and a decrease in trading instruments, net. These increases were partially offset by the use of operating cash resulting from an increase in assets segregated pursuant to regulations and other segregated assets and by the purchase and origination of loans held for sale (net of proceeds received). Segregated assets increased as a result of an increase in customer deposits, partially offset by a decrease resulting from the prior year transactions associated with the point-in-time regulatory balance sheet composition requirements related to RJ Bank qualifying as a thrift institution at September 30, 2010 not recurring as of September 30, 2011. RJ Bank was granted an exception to the balance sheet test as of September 30, 2011 (for more information regarding these point-in-time transactions, see Notes 2 and 22 of the Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements in this Form 10-K). Investing activities used $400 million of cash in the year ended September 30, 2011. The use of cash was to fund an increase in net loans and to purchase ARS (see further discussion of the ARS matter in Item 3: Legal Proceedings, and in Note 17 of the Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements in this Form 10-K). These investing uses of cash were partially offset by cash received from the maturation, sales, repayment and redemptions of certain available for sale securities in our portfolio and from the redemptions of FHLB stock. Financing activities used $1.7 billion of cash in the year ended September 30, 2011. Increases in bank deposit balances and the issuance of senior notes through a registered underwritten public offering (for more information regarding our senior notes, see Note 14 of the Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements in this Form 10-K) resulted in increases in cash provided by financing activities. The primary use of cash provided by financing activities were repayments on certain lines of credit as well as repayments of certain borrowings that were made as of September 30, 2010 to meet the point-in-time regulatory balance sheet composition requirements related to RJ Bank qualifying as a thrift institution. As mentioned in the operating activities discussion above, transactions related to the point-in-time regulatory balance sheet composition test did not occur as of September 30, 2011. Additionally, cash was used during the year for the payment of dividends to shareholders and to a lesser extent, the repurchase of our shares. We believe our existing assets, most of which are liquid in nature, together with funds generated from operations and committed and uncommitted financing facilities, should provide adequate funds for continuing operations at current levels of activity. Sources of liquidity We have approximately $474 million of available cash and cash equivalents as of September 30, 2011 (comprised primarily of $250 million of cash and cash equivalents held on deposit at RJ Bank in the parent company account, and $221 million of cash and cash equivalents which is invested by RJ&A on behalf of RJF). Additionally, we have various potential sources of liquidity as set forth below. 52 Liquidity available from subsidiaries Liquidity is principally available to the parent company from RJ&A, which is required to maintain net capital equal to the greater of $1 million or 2% of aggregate debit balances arising from customer transactions. Covenants in RJ&A committed secured financing facilities require its net capital to be a minimum of 10% of aggregate debit balances. At September 30, 2011, RJ&A exceeded both the minimum regulatory, and its financing covenants, net capital requirements. At that date, RJ&A had excess net capital of approximately $380 million, of which approximately $182 million is available for dividend (after taking into account regulatory and covenant restrictions) while still maintaining its net capital at 15% of aggregate debit items, its current internal and informal policy. There are also limitations on the amount of dividends that may be declared by a broker-dealer without FINRA approval. Subject to 30-day notification and approval by its regulator, RJ Bank may pay dividends to the parent company as long as RJ Bank maintains its well capitalized status under bank regulatory capital guidelines. During the year ended September 30, 2011, RJ Bank made $100 million in dividend payments to RJF. RJF made capital contributions of $25 million to RJ Bank during the same period. RJ Bank had approximately $126 million of capital in excess of the amount it would need as of September 30, 2011 to maintain a total capital to risk-weighted assets ratio of 12%, its current policy. See further discussion of RJ Bank ability to pay dividends in Note 22 of the Notes to the Consolidated Financial Statements. One of our non-broker-dealer subsidiaries, RJ Securities, Inc., currently holds the ARS portion of the available for sale securities portfolio, which approximates $196 million at fair value as of September 30, 2011. Any redemptions by issuers of the ARS will create liquidity during the period such redemption occurs. Liquidity available to us from our subsidiaries, other than RJ&A, RJ Bank and RJ Securities, Inc., is relatively insignificant and, in certain instances, may be subject to regulatory requirements.

The uncommitted domestic financing arrangements are in the form of secured lines of credit, secured bilateral or tri-party repurchase agreements, or unsecured lines of credit. We maintain three unsecured settlement lines of credit available to our Argentine joint venture in the aggregate amount of $13.4 million. Of the aggregate amount, one settlement line for $9 million is guaranteed by RJF. There were no borrowings outstanding on any of these lines of credit as of September 30, 2011. RJ Bank had $1 billion in immediate credit available from the FHLB on September 30, 2011 and total available credit of 40% of total assets, with the pledge of additional collateral to the FHLB. RJ Bank is eligible to participate in the FRB discount-window program; however, RJ Bank does not view borrowings from the FRB as a primary means of funding. The credit available in this program is subject to periodic review and may be terminated or reduced at the discretion of the FRB. From time to time we purchase short-term securities under agreements to resell ( Reverse Repurchase Agreements ) and sell securities under agreements to repurchase ( Repurchase Agreements ). We account for each of these types of transactions as collateralized financings with the outstanding balances on the Repurchase Agreements included in securities sold under agreements to repurchase. At September 30, 2011, collateralized financings outstanding in the amount of $188.8 million are included in securities sold under agreements to repurchase on the Consolidated Statements of Financial Condition. Of this total, outstanding borrowings on the committed and uncommitted Repurchase Agreements were $89.9 million and $98.9 million, respectively, as of September 30, 2011. Such financings are generally collateralized by non-customer, RJ&A-owned securities. The required market value of the collateral associated with the committed secured facilities ranges from 102% to 133% of the amount financed. 53 The average daily balance outstanding during the five most recent successive quarters and the period ended balances at each respective period end for Repurchase Agreements and Reverse Repurchase Agreements are as follows: Repurchase transactions Reverse repurchase transactions For the period ended : Average daily balance outstanding End of period balance outstanding Average daily balance outstanding End of period balance outstanding (in thousands) September 30, 2011 $ 145,574 $ 188,745 $ 425,248 $ 398,247 June 30, 2011 62,527 64,988 473,739 470,407 March 31, 2011 66,848 62,292 444,640 390,376 December 31, 2010 76,973 166,815 402,804 456,239 September 30, 2010 158,489 233,346 326,927 344,652 At September 30, 2011 and September 30, 2010, we had other debt of $612 million and $356 million, respectively. The balance at September 30, 2011 is comprised of a $53 million balance outstanding on our mortgage loan for our home-office complex, $9 million outstanding on term loan financing provided to RJES, $300 million outstanding on our 8.60% senior notes due August 2019, and $250 million outstanding on our 4.25% senior notes due April 2016. Our current senior long-term debt ratings are: Rating Agency Rating Outlook Standard and Poor BBB Stable Moody Investor Service Baa2 Stable The S&P rating and outlook as presented in their November, 2011 report reflects no change in the rating and an improved outlook as compared to their previous report. The Moody Investor Service rating and outlook are from their October, 2010 report, which reflected no change in the rating and an improved outlook as compared to their previous report. We believe our current long-term debt ratings depend upon a number of factors including industry dynamics, operating and economic environment, operating results, operating margins, earnings trends and volatility, balance sheet composition, liquidity and liquidity management, our capital structure, our overall risk management, business diversification and our market share and competitive position in the markets in which we operate. Deteriorations in any of these factors could impact our credit ratings. Any rating downgrades could increase our costs in the event we were to pursue obtaining additional financing. Other sources of liquidity We own life insurance policies which are utilized to fund certain non-qualified deferred compensation plans and other employee benefit plans. We are able to borrow up to 90% of the cash surrender value of certain of these policies. The policies which we could readily borrow against have a cash surrender value of approximately $104.7 million as of September 30, 2011. There are no borrowings outstanding against any of these policies as of September 30, 2011. On May 29, 2009 we filed a universal shelf registration statement with the SEC to be in a position to access the capital markets if and when necessary or perceived by us to be opportune. In August 2009, we sold $300 million in aggregate principal amount of 8.60% senior notes due in August 2019, through a registered underwritten public offering. In April 2011, we sold $250 million in aggregate principal amount of 4.25% senior notes due April 2016, through a registered underwritten public offering. The registration statement is effective through May, 2012 and could facilitate future capital raising activities. See the contractual obligations, commitments and contingencies section for information regarding our commitments. Statement of financial condition analysis The assets on our statement of financial condition consist primarily of cash and cash equivalents (a large portion of which are segregated for the benefit of customers), receivables, including bank loans, and other assets. A significant portion of our assets are liquid in nature, providing us with flexibility in financing our business. 54 Total assets of $18 billion at September 30, 2011 were approximately 1% higher than total assets as of September 30, 2010. However, the prior year balances included approximately $3.1 billion in assets associated with transactions required to meet RJ Bank point-in-time regulatory balance sheet composition requirements test. As of September 30, 2011, similar transactions did not occur since RJ Bank was granted an exception to the balance sheet composition requirements test through September 29, 2012 (see Note 22 of our Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements for more information regarding these point-in-time requirements). Exclusive of these prior year point-in-time test transactions, total assets as of September 30, 2011 increased 22%. This increase is primarily a result of increases in cash and cash equivalents, assets segregated pursuant to regulations and other segregated assets and an increase in our bank loan assets. Our cash and other segregated assets balances as of September 30, 2011 were higher than the prior year due in large part to the August and September 2011 market volatility which resulted in many of our clients increasing their holdings of cash equivalents. These increased holdings exhausted our capacity to invest such amounts at unaffiliated financial institutions through the RJBDP which, in turn, resulted in RJ Bank carrying substantially higher cash balances. As of September 30, 2011, our liabilities of $15.1 billion were 1% less than our liabilities as of September 30, 2010. Similar to the discussion above regarding the impact of the point-in-time transactions on asset balances, the prior year liability balances included borrowings associated with such point-in-time transactions. Exclusive of these prior year transactions, total liabilities at September 30, 2011 as compared to the prior year increased 24%. This increase results primarily from the factors described above for the increase in assets. As our clients shifted their portfolios to cash, our brokerage client payables increased and without the capacity to invest in unaffiliated banks through the RJBDP, the bank deposit liability at RJ Bank increased. Additionally, corporate debt increased during the year as a result of our issuance of $250 million in aggregate principal amount of 4.25% senior notes due April 2016. Contractual obligations, commitments and contingencies We have contractual obligations to make future payments in connection with short- and long-term debt, non-cancelable lease agreements, partnership and limited liability company investments, commitments to extend credit, underwriting commitments and a naming rights agreement. The following table sets forth these contractual obligations by fiscal year: Total 2012 2013 2014 2015 2016 Thereafter (in thousands) Debt (1) $ 611,968 $ 9,841 $ 6,960 $ 3,860 $ 4,086 $ 254,325 $ 332,896 Loans payable of consolidated variable interest entities (2) 99,982 21,332 18,771 19,088 17,958 12,978 9,855 Operating leases 229,671 45,996 41,811 33,475 27,291 23,732 57,366 Investments - private equity partnerships 31,073 31,073 - - - - - Certificates of deposit (3) 245,340 49,755 39,429 27,331 65,407 63,418 - Commitments to extend credit - RJ Bank (4) 2,263,962 2,263,962 - - - - - RJ Bank loans purchased, not yet settled 72,700 72,700 - - - - - RJ Bank commitment to purchase Canadian loans (5) 500,000 500,000 - - - - - Commitments to real estate entities 2,876 2,876 - - - - - Commitment to purchase real estate in Pasco County, Florida (6) 3,500 3,500 - - - - - Underwriting commitments 861 861 - - - - - Naming rights for Raymond James stadium 16,705 3,687 3,835 3,988 4,148 1,047 - Loans and commitments to financial advisors 20,932 17,761 2,667 504 - - - Total $ 4,099,570 $ 3,023,344 $ 113,473 $ 88,246 $ 118,890 $ 355,500 $ 400,117 (1) See Notes 12 and 14 of the Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements for additional information.

The Board of Directors has approved the use of up to $75 million for investment in proprietary merchant banking opportunities. As of September 30, 2011, we have invested approximately $34.9 million. The use of this capital is subject to availability of funds. These activities may be impacted by regulations resulting from the Dodd-Frank Act. However, since the regulations have yet to be adopted, any impact is uncertain. Our Board of Directors has also approved up to $200 million in short-term special situations and bridge investments, primarily related to investment banking transactions. As of September 30, 2011, we did not have any such investments. We are authorized by the Board of Directors to repurchase our common stock for general corporate purposes. There is no formal stock repurchase plan at this time. From time to time our Board of Directors has authorized specific dollar amounts for repurchases at the discretion of our Board Securities Repurchase Committee. As of September 30, 2011 the unused portion of the current authorization was $60.2 million. We are the lessor in a leveraged commercial aircraft transaction with Continental Airlines, Inc. ( Continental ). Our ability to realize our expected return is dependent upon this airline ability to fulfill its lease obligation. In the event that this airline defaults on its lease commitment and the Trustee for the debt holders is unable to re-lease or sell the plane with adequate terms, we would suffer a loss of some or all of our investment. The net value of our leveraged lease with Continental is approximately $8.4 million, which is included in Other Assets on our Consolidated Statements of Financial Condition, as of September 30, 2011. This lease expires in May 2014. In the normal course of business, certain subsidiaries of ours act as general partner and may be contingently liable for activities of various limited partnerships. These partnerships engage primarily in real estate activities. In our opinion, such liabilities, if any, for the obligations of the partnerships will not in the aggregate have a material adverse effect on our consolidated financial position. Regulatory Our broker-dealer subsidiaries are subject to requirements of the SEC in the United States and the IIROC in Canada relating to liquidity and capital standards. Our domestic broker-dealer subsidiaries are subject to the requirements of the Uniform Net Capital Rule (Rule 15c3-1) under the Securities Exchange Act of 1934. RJ&A, a member firm of FINRA, is also subject to the rules of FINRA, whose requirements are substantially the same. Rule 15c3-1 requires that aggregate indebtedness, as defined, not exceed 15 times net capital, as defined. Rule 15c3-1 also provides for an alternative net capital requirement, which RJ&A, RJFS, EFD, Lane Berry & Co. International, LLC, Howe Barnes and Raymond James (USA) Ltd. have elected. It requires that minimum net capital, as defined, be equal to the greater of $250,000 (or $1 million in the case of RJ&A) or two percent of Aggregate Debit Items arising from client transactions. FINRA may require a member firm to reduce its business if its net capital is less than four percent of Aggregate Debit Items and may prohibit a member firm from expanding its business and declaring cash dividends if its net capital is less than five percent of Aggregate Debit Items. RJ&A, RJFS, EFD, Lane Berry & Co. International, LLC, Howe Barnes and Raymond James (USA) Ltd. all had net capital in excess of minimum requirements as of September 30, 2011. RJ Ltd. is subject to the Minimum Capital Rule (By-Law No. 17 of the IIROC) and the Early Warning System (By-Law No. 30 of the IIROC). The Minimum Capital Rule requires that every member shall have and maintain at all times risk adjusted capital greater than zero calculated in accordance with Form 1 (Joint Regulatory Financial Questionnaire and Report) and with such requirements as the Board of Directors of the IIROC may from time to time prescribe. Insufficient Risk Adjusted Capital may result in suspension from membership in the stock exchanges or the IIROC. The Early Warning System is designed to provide advance warning that a member firm is encountering financial difficulties. This system imposes certain sanctions on members who are designated in Early Warning Level 1 or Level 2 according to its capital, profitability, liquidity position, frequency of designation or at the discretion of the IIROC. Restrictions on business activities and capital transactions, early filing requirements, and mandated corrective measures are sanctions that may be imposed as part of the Early Warning System. RJ Ltd. was not in Early Warning Level 1 or Level 2 during fiscal 2011 or 2010. RJ Bank is subject to various regulatory and capital requirements administered by bank regulators. See Item 1, Business Regulation , for a discussion of the regulatory environment which RJ Bank operates, and see Note 22 of the Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements in this Form 10-K, for further information regarding RJ Bank capital. Management believes that RJ Bank meets all capital adequacy requirements to which it is subject to as of September 30, 2011. 56 The Dodd-Frank Act has the potential to impact certain of our current business operations, including, but not limited to, its impact on RJ Bank which is discussed in Item 1, Business Regulation. Because of the nature of our business and our business practices, we do not expect the Dodd-Frank Act to have a significant impact on our operations as a whole. However, because many of the implementing regulations will result from further studies by various regulatory agencies, the specific impact on each of our businesses is uncertain. Effective July 21, 2011 and in accordance with the Dodd-Frank Act, RJF as the holding company of RJ Bank, became subject to the oversight of the FRB. In addition, the OTS merged into the OCC and, therefore, the OCC assumed responsibility from the OTS for the ongoing examination, supervision, and regulation of federal savings associations and rulemaking for all savings associations, state and federal. See Note 22 of the Notes to the Consolidated Financial Statements in this Form 10-K for further information on regulatory and capital requirements . Critical accounting policies The consolidated financial statements are prepared in accordance with GAAP. For a full description of these and other accounting policies, see Note 1 of the Notes to the Consolidated Financial Statements. We believe that of our significant accounting policies, those described below involve a high degree of judgment and complexity. These critical accounting policies require estimates and assumptions that affect the amounts of assets, liabilities, revenues and expenses reported in the consolidated financial statements. Due to their nature, estimates involve judgment based upon available information. Actual results or amounts could differ from estimates and the difference could have a material impact on the consolidated financial statements. Therefore, understanding these policies is important in understanding the reported results of our operations and our financial position. Valuation of financial instruments, investments and other assets The use of fair value to measure financial instruments, with related gains or losses recognized in our Consolidated Statements of Income and Comprehensive Income, is fundamental to our financial statements and our risk management processes. Trading instruments and available for sale securities are reflected in the Consolidated Statements of Financial Condition at fair value or amounts that approximate fair value. Unrealized gains and losses related to these financial instruments are reflected in our net income or our other comprehensive income, depending on the underlying purpose of the instrument. We measure the fair value of our financial instruments in accordance with GAAP, which defines fair value, establishes a framework that we use to measure fair value and provides for certain disclosures we provide about our fair value measurements included in our financial statements. Refer to Notes 3 and 4 in our Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements for these disclosures. Fair value is defined by GAAP as the exchange price that would be received for an asset or paid to transfer a liability (an exit price) in the principal or most advantageous market for the asset or liability in an orderly transaction between willing market participants on the measurement date. We determine the fair values of our financial instruments and any other assets and liabilities required by GAAP to be recognized at fair value in the financial statements as of the close of business at each financial statement reporting period. These fair value determination processes also apply to any of our impairment tests or assessments performed for nonfinancial instruments such as goodwill, certain real estate owned and other long-lived assets. In determining fair value in accordance with GAAP, we use various valuation approaches, including market and/or income approaches. Fair value is a market-based measure considered from the perspective of a market participant. As such, even when assumptions of market participants are not readily available, our own assumptions reflect those that market participants would use in pricing the asset or liability at the measurement date. GAAP provides for the following three levels to be used to classify our fair value measurements: Level 1 Financial instruments included in Level 1 are highly liquid instruments with quoted prices in active markets for identical assets or liabilities. These include equity securities traded in active markets and certain U. S. Treasury securities, other governmental obligations, or publicly traded corporate debt securities. 57 Level 2 Financial instruments reported in Level 2 include those that have pricing inputs that are other than quoted prices in active markets, but which are either directly or indirectly observable as of the reporting date (i.e., prices for similar instruments). Instruments that are generally included in this category are equity securities that are not actively traded, corporate obligations infrequently traded, certain government and municipal obligations, interest rate swaps, certain asset-backed securities ( ABS ), certain collateralized mortgage obligations ( CMO ), certain mortgage-backed securities ( MBS ) and most of our derivative instruments. Level 3 Financial instruments reported in Level 3 have little, if any, market activity and are measured using our best estimate of fair value, where significant inputs into the determination of fair value are unobservable. These valuations require significant judgment or estimation. Instruments in this category generally include equity securities with unobservable inputs such as those investments made in our Proprietary Capital segment, certain non-agency CMOs, certain non-agency ABS and certain municipal and corporate obligations which include ARS. GAAP requires that we maximize the use of observable inputs and minimize the use of unobservable inputs when performing our fair value measurements. The availability of observable inputs can vary from instrument to instrument and in certain cases, the inputs used to measure fair value may fall into different levels of the fair value hierarchy. In such cases, an instrument level within the fair value hierarchy is based on the lowest level of input that is significant to the fair value measurement. Our assessment of the significance of a particular input to the fair value measurement of an instrument requires judgment and consideration of factors specific to the instrument. Valuation techniques The fair value for certain of our financial instruments is derived using pricing models and other valuation techniques that involve significant management judgment. The price transparency of financial instruments is a key determinant of the degree of judgment involved in determining the fair value of our financial instruments. Financial instruments for which actively quoted prices or pricing parameters are available will generally have a higher degree of price transparency than financial instruments that are thinly traded or not quoted. In accordance with GAAP, the criteria used to determine whether the market for a financial instrument is active or inactive is based on the particular asset or liability. For equity securities, our definition of actively traded is based on average daily volume and other market trading statistics. We have determined the market for certain other types of financial instruments, including certain CMOs, ABS, certain collateralized debt obligations, and ARS, to be volatile, uncertain or inactive as of September 30, 2011. As a result, the valuation of these financial instruments included significant management judgment in determining the relevance and reliability of market information available. We considered the inactivity of the market to be evidenced by several factors, including a lack of price transparency caused by decreased volume of trades relative to historical levels, stale transaction prices and transaction prices that varied significantly either over time or among market makers. The specific valuation techniques utilized for the categorization of financial instruments presented in our Consolidated Statements of Financial Condition are described below. Trading instruments and trading instruments sold but not yet purchased Trading securities Trading securities are comprised primarily of the financial instruments held by our broker-dealer subsidiaries (see Note 4 of the Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements for more information). When available, we use quoted prices in active markets to determine the fair value of these securities. Such instruments are classified within Level 1 of the fair value hierarchy. Examples include exchange traded equity securities and liquid government debt securities. When instruments are traded in secondary markets and quoted market prices do not exist for such securities, we utilize valuation techniques, including matrix pricing, to estimate fair value. Matrix pricing generally utilizes spread-based models periodically re-calibrated to observable inputs such as market trades, or to dealer price bids in similar securities in order to derive the fair value of the instruments. Valuation techniques may also rely on other observable inputs such as yield curves, interest rates and expected principal repayments, and default probabilities. Instruments valued using these inputs are typically classified within Level 2 of the fair value hierarchy. We utilize prices from independent services to corroborate our estimate of fair value. Depending upon the type of security, the pricing service may provide a listed price, a matrix price, or use other methods including broker-dealer price quotations. 58 Positions in illiquid securities that do not have readily determinable fair values require significant judgment or estimation. For these securities, which include ARS, we use pricing models, discounted cash flow methodologies, or similar techniques. Assumptions utilized by these techniques include estimates of future delinquencies, loss severities, defaults and prepayments. Securities valued using these techniques are classified within Level 3 of the fair value hierarchy. For certain CMOs, where there has been limited activity or less transparency around significant inputs to the valuation, such as assumptions regarding performance of the underlying mortgages, these securities are currently classified as Level 3 even though we believe that Level 2 inputs will likely be obtainable should markets for these securities become more active in the future. Derivatives We enter into interest rate swaps and futures contracts either as part of our fixed income business to facilitate customer transactions, to hedge a portion of our trading inventory, or for our own account. See Note 15 of the Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements for more information. Fair values for our interest rate derivative contracts are obtained from internal pricing models that consider current market trading levels and the contractual prices for the underlying financial instruments, as well as time value, yield curve and other volatility factors underlying the positions. Where model inputs can be observed in a liquid market and the model does not require significant judgment, such derivative contracts are typically classified within Level 2 of the fair value hierarchy. We utilize values obtained from third-party counterparty derivatives dealers to corroborate the output of our internal pricing models. The fair value of any cash collateral exchanged as part of the interest rate swap contract is netted, by counterparty, against the fair value of the derivative instrument. Available for sale securities Available for sale securities are comprised primarily of MBS, CMOs or other mortgage-related debt securities held predominately by RJ Bank and ARS held by a non-broker-dealer subsidiary of RJF. Debt and equity securities classified as available for sale are reported at fair value with unrealized gains and losses, net of deferred taxes, recorded through other comprehensive income and thereafter presented in shareholders' equity as a component of accumulated other comprehensive income ( AOCI ) unless the loss is considered to be other-than-temporary, in which case the related credit loss portion is recognized as a loss in other revenue. Realized gains and losses on sales of such securities are recognized using the specific identification method and reflected in other revenue in the period they are sold. The fair value of agency and senior non-agency securities is determined by obtaining third-party pricing service bid quotations and third-party broker-dealer quotes. Third-party pricing service bid quotations are based on either current market data, or for any securities traded in markets where the trading activity has slowed significantly such as the CMO market, the most recently available market data. The third-party pricing service provides comparable price evaluations utilizing available market data for similar securities. The market data the third-party pricing service utilizes for these price evaluations includes observable data comprised of benchmark yields, reported trades, broker-dealer quotes, issuer spreads, two-sided markets, benchmark securities, bids, offers, reference data including market research publications, and loan performance experience. In order to validate that the pricing information used by the third-party pricing service is observable, we request, on a quarterly basis, some of the key market data available for a sample of senior securities and compare this data to that which we observed in our independent accumulation of market information. Securities valued using these valuation techniques are classified within Level 2 of the fair value hierarchy. For senior non-agency securities where a significant difference exists between the third-party pricing service bid quotation and the third-party broker-dealer quote, we utilize a discounted cash flow analysis to determine which third-party price quote is most representative of fair value under the current market conditions. The fair values for all senior non-agency securities at September 30, 2011 were based on the respective third-party pricing service bid quotation. Securities measured using these valuation techniques are generally classified within Level 2 of the fair value hierarchy. ARS are long-term variable rate securities tied to short-term interest rates that were intended to be reset through a Dutch auction process, which generally occurs every seven to 35 days. Holders of ARS were previously able to liquidate their holdings to prospective buyers by participating in the auctions. During 2008, the Dutch auction process failed and holders were no longer able to liquidate their holdings through the auction process. The fair value of the ARS holdings is estimated based on internal pricing models. The pricing model takes into consideration the characteristics of the underlying securities, as well as multiple inputs including the issuer and their credit quality, data from any recent trades, the expected timing of redemptions and an estimated yield premium that a market participant would require over otherwise comparable securities to compensate for the illiquidity of the ARS. These inputs require significant management judgment and, accordingly, these securities are classified within Level 3 of the fair value hierarchy. 59 For debt securities in an unrealized loss position at the reporting period end, we make an assessment whether these securities are impaired on an other-than-temporary basis. In order to evaluate our risk exposure and any potential impairment of these securities, on at least a quarterly basis, we review the characteristics of each security owned such as collateral type, delinquency and foreclosure levels, credit enhancement, projected loan losses, collateral coverage and presence of U.S. government or government agency guarantees. The following factors are considered to determine whether an impairment is other-than-temporary: our intention to sell the security, our assessment of whether it is more likely than not that we will be required to sell the security before the recovery of its amortized cost basis, and whether the evidence indicating that we will recover the amortized cost basis of a security in full outweighs evidence to the contrary. Evidence considered in this assessment includes the reasons for the impairment, the severity and duration of the impairment, changes in value subsequent to period end, recent events specific to the issuer or industry, forecasted performance of the security, and any changes to the rating of the security by a rating agency. Securities on which there is an unrealized loss that is deemed to be other-than-temporary are written-down to fair value with the credit loss portion of the write-down recorded as a realized loss in other revenue and the non-credit portion of the write-down recorded net of deferred taxes in other comprehensive income and are thereafter presented in equity as a component of AOCI. The credit loss portion of the write-down is the difference between the present value of the cash flows expected to be collected and the amortized cost basis of the security. The previous amortized cost basis of the security less the other-than-temporary impairment recognized in earnings establishes the new cost basis for the security. We estimate the portion of loss attributable to credit using a discounted cash flow model. Our discounted cash flow model utilizes relevant assumptions such as prepayment rate, default rate, and loss severity on a loan level basis. These assumptions are subject to change depending on a number of factors such as economic conditions, changes in home prices, and delinquency and foreclosure statistics, among others. Events that may trigger material declines in fair values or additional credit losses for these securities in the future would include, but are not limited to, deterioration of credit metrics, significantly higher levels of default and severity of loss on the underlying collateral, deteriorating credit enhancement and loss coverage ratios, or further illiquidity. Private equity investments Private equity investments, held primarily by our Proprietary Capital segment, consist of various direct and third-party private equity and merchant banking investments. The valuation of these investments requires significant management judgment due to the absence of quoted market prices, inherent lack of liquidity and long-term nature of these assets. As a result, these values cannot be determined with precision and the calculated fair value estimates may not be realizable in a current sale or immediate settlement of the instrument. Direct private equity investments are valued initially at the transaction price until significant transactions or developments indicate that a change in the carrying values of these investments is appropriate. The carrying values of these investments are adjusted based on financial performance, investment-specific events, financing and sales transactions with third parties and discounted cash flow models incorporating changes in market outlook. Investments in funds structured as limited partnerships are generally valued based on the financial statements of the partnerships. Investments valued using these valuation techniques are classified within Level 3 of the fair value hierarchy. Other investments Other investments consist primarily of Canadian government bonds and term deposits with Canadian financial institutions. The Canadian government bonds are measured at fair value with any changes recognized in our Consolidated Statements of Income and Comprehensive Income for the period. The fair value is based upon recent external market transactions. The Canadian financial institution term deposits are recorded at cost, which approximates market value. These investments are classified within Level 1 of the fair value hierarchy. Level 3 assets and liabilities Level 3 assets were $368 million and $176 million as of September 30, 2011 and 2010, respectively, and represented 28% and 13.1% of total assets measured at fair value as of September 30, 2011 and 2010, respectively. Our investments in private equity comprise $169 million, or 46%, and our ARS positions comprise $196 million, or 53%, of the Level 3 assets as of September 30, 2011. Our investments in private equity comprised $161 million, or 92%, of Level 3 assets as of September 30, 2010. Altogether, our Level 3 assets represent 12.5% and 6.8% of total equity as of September 30, 2011 and 2010, respectively. See Note 5 in the Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements for more information on our ARS holdings which are included in available for sale securities. 60 Financial instruments which are liabilities categorized as Level 3 amount to less than $100,000 as of both September 30, 2011 and 2010, and represent less than 1% of both total liabilities, and total equity, measured as of the end of each reporting period. Goodwill Goodwill involves the application of significant management judgment. Of our total goodwill of $72 million, $30 million arose from our acquisition of Roney & Co. (now part of RJ&A) which occurred during fiscal year 1999, $33 million arose from our acquisition of Goepel McDermid, Inc. (now RJ Ltd.) which occurred during fiscal year 2001, $2 million arose from our acquisition of Howe Barnes which occurred in April 2011 and $7 million arose from our increased share of ownership in RJES which also occurred in April 2011. See Note 1 in the Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements for information on the goodwill for Howe Barnes and RJES. This goodwill was allocated to the reporting units; $48 million is included in the PCG segment and $24 million is included in the Capital Markets segment. We perform goodwill testing on an annual basis or when an event occurs or circumstances change that would more likely than not reduce the fair value of the equity of a reporting unit below its carrying value. This impairment testing involves assigning tangible assets and liabilities, identified intangible assets and goodwill to the reporting units and comparing the fair value of the equity of each reporting unit to its carrying value. In our determination of each reporting units fair value of equity, we use a combination of the income approach and the market approach. Under the income approach, we use discounted cash flow models applied to each respective reporting unit. Under the market approach, we calculate an estimated fair value based on a combination of the multiples of earnings of guideline companies in the brokerage and capital markets industry that are publicly traded on organized exchanges, and the book value of comparable transactions. The estimated fair value of the equity of the reporting unit resulting from each of these valuation approaches is dependent upon a number of significant management assumptions. The valuation result from the income approach is dependent upon estimates of future business unit revenues and costs, such estimates are subject to critical assumptions regarding the nature and health of financial markets in future years as well as the discount rate to apply to the projected future cash flows. The valuation result from the market approach is dependent upon the selection of the comparable guideline companies and transactions and the earnings multiple applied to each respective reporting units projected earnings. Finally, significant management judgment is applied in determining the weight assigned to the outcome of the market approach and the income approach, which results in one single estimate of the fair value of the equity of the reporting unit. During the quarter ended March 31, 2011, we updated our income approach and market approach valuation models as of December 31, 2010 for the PCG and Capital Markets reporting units which have an allocation of goodwill (excluding goodwill acquired in April 2011). Based upon this updated analysis, we concluded that the goodwill allocated to our reporting units was not impaired at December 31, 2010. Our valuation estimates for those reporting units indicated that the fair values of their equity were substantially in excess of their book carrying values, which include the allocated goodwill. No events have occurred since the completion of that analysis that would cause us to update the annual impairment testing we last performed as of December 31, 2010. We will continue to perform impairment testing on an annual basis or when an event occurs or circumstances change that would more likely than not have resulted in a reduction of the fair value of a reporting unit to an amount less than its carrying amount. Loss provisions Loss provisions arising from legal proceedings We recognize liabilities for contingencies when there is an exposure that, when fully analyzed, indicates it is both probable that a liability has been incurred and the amount of loss can be reasonably estimated. The estimated range of possible loss is based upon currently available information and is subject to significant judgment, a variety of assumptions, and uncertainties. When a range of possible loss can be estimated, we accrue the most likely amount of possible loss within that range; if the most likely amount within that range is not determinable, we accrue a minimum based on the range of possible loss. No liability is recognized for those matters which, in managements judgment, the determination of a reasonable estimate of loss is not possible. 61 We record liabilities related to legal proceedings in trade and other payables within our Consolidated Statements of Financial Condition. The determination of whether a loss is probable, and if so the possible loss amount, requires significant judgment. We consider many factors including, but not limited to: the amount of the claim; the amount of the loss in the client's account; the basis and validity of the claim; the possibility of wrongdoing on the part of one of our employees; previous results in similar cases; and legal precedents and case law. Each legal proceeding is reviewed with counsel in each accounting period and the liability is adjusted as we consider appropriate. Any change in the liability amount is recorded in the consolidated financial statements and is recognized as either a charge or a credit to net income in that period. The actual costs of resolving legal proceedings may be substantially higher or lower than the recorded liability amounts for those matters. Loss provisions arising from operations of our Broker-Dealers We offer loans to financial advisors and certain key revenue producers, primarily for recruiting and retention purposes. These loans are generally repaid over a five to eight year period with interest recognized as earned. Additionally, there are no fees or costs associated with these loans. We assess future recoverability of these loans through analysis of individual financial advisor production or other performance standards. In the event that the financial advisor becomes no longer affiliated with us, any unpaid balance of such loan becomes immediately due and payable to us. In determining the allowance for doubtful accounts from former employees or independent contractors, management considers a number of factors including; any amounts due at termination, the reasons for the terminated relationship, the former financial advisor overall financial position, and our historical collection experience. When the review of these factors indicates that further collection activity is highly unlikely, the outstanding balances of such loans are written off and the corresponding allowance is reduced. We also record reserves or allowances for doubtful accounts related to client receivables. Client receivables at our broker-dealer subsidiaries are generally collateralized by securities owned by the brokerage clients. Therefore, when a receivable is considered to be impaired, the amount of the impairment is generally measured based on the fair value of the securities acting as collateral, which is measured based on current prices from independent sources such as listed market prices or broker-dealer price quotations. Loan loss provisions arising from operations of RJ Bank RJ Bank provides an allowance for loan losses which reflects our continuing evaluation of the probable losses inherent in the loan portfolio. Refer to Note 1 of the Notes to the Consolidated Financial Statements in this form 10-K for discussion of RJ Bank policies regarding the allowance for loan losses, and refer to Note 7 of the Notes to the Consolidated Financial Statements in this form 10-K for quantitative information regarding the allowance balances as of September 30, 2011. At September 30, 2011, the amortized cost of all RJ Bank loans was $6.7 billion and an allowance for loan losses of $145.7 million was recorded against that balance. The total allowance for loan losses is equal to 2.18% of the amortized cost of the loan portfolio. The current condition of the real estate and credit markets has substantially increased the complexity and uncertainty involved in estimating the losses inherent in RJ Bank loan portfolio. If our underlying assumptions and judgments prove to be inaccurate, the allowance for loan losses could be insufficient to cover actual losses. In such an event, any losses would result in a decrease in our net income as well as a decrease in the level of regulatory capital at RJ Bank. Income taxes The objectives of accounting for income taxes are to recognize the amount of taxes payable or refundable for the current year and deferred tax liabilities and assets for the future tax consequences of events that have been recognized in our financial statements or tax returns. GAAP recognizes that the final outcome of certain tax positions we may take are uncertain, and provides standards for reflecting these uncertainties in our financial statements. Judgment is required in assessing the future tax consequences of events that have been recognized in our financial statements or tax returns. Variations in the actual outcome of these future tax consequences could materially impact our financial position, results of operations, or liquidity. See Note 16 of the Notes to Financial Statements in this Form 10-K for further information on our uncertain tax positions. 62 Effects of recently issued accounting standards and accounting standards not yet adopted In June 2009, the FASB issued new guidance regarding the accounting for transfers of financial assets, as an amendment of previously issued guidance. This new guidance eliminates the Qualified Special Purpose Entity ( QSPE ) concept, creates more stringent conditions for reporting a transfer of a portion of a financial asset as a sale, clarifies the derecognition criteria, revises how retained interests are initially measured, and removes the guaranteed mortgage securitization recharacterization provisions. We adopted this new guidance as of October 1, 2010. There was no significant impact on our consolidated financial statements as a result of our application of this new guidance. In June 2009, the FASB issued new guidance amending the existing pronouncement related to the consolidation of variable interest entities. This new guidance requires the reporting entities to evaluate former QSPEs for consolidation, changes the approach to determine a variable interest entity primary beneficiary from a quantitative assessment to a qualitative assessment designed to identify a controlling financial interest, and increases the frequency of required assessments to determine whether we are the primary beneficiary of any variable interest entities to which we are a party. We adopted this new guidance as of October 1, 2010. Upon adoption, we deconsolidated two low-income housing tax credit ( LIHTC ) funds of which we determined we are no longer the primary beneficiary, and consolidated two other LIHTC funds of which we determined we are the primary beneficiary under the new guidance. See Note 1of the Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements in this Form 10-K for more information on the adoption of this new accounting guidance. In July 2010, the FASB issued new guidance that requires enhanced disclosure about our allowances for loan losses and credit quality of our financing receivables. This new guidance is intended to provide greater transparency about credit risk exposures and the adequacy of the allowance for loan losses and other financing receivables and includes disaggregation of existing disclosures based on what management uses when assessing and monitoring the financing receivable risk and performance. Additionally, new financial statement disclosures related to credit quality indicators, aging of financing receivables, and any significant purchases and sales were required. See Notes 1 and 7 of the Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements in this Form 10-K for the disclosures arising from our adoption of this new accounting guidance. The adoption of this new accounting guidance resulted in additional disclosures, but did not have any impact on our financial position or results of operations. In April 2011, the FASB issued new guidance regarding a creditor determination of whether a restructuring is a troubled debt restructuring ( TDR ). This new guidance requires creditors to evaluate modifications and restructurings using a more principles-based approach, which may result in more modifications and restructurings being considered TDRs. This new guidance is effective for us in our period ending September 30, 2011. Our adoption of this guidance resulted in additional disclosures but did not have a significant impact on our consolidated financial position or results of operations. See these disclosures included in Note 1 and Note 7 of the Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements in this Form 10-K. In April 2011, the FASB issued new guidance regarding the evaluation of certain terms in repurchase agreements which impact the determination of whether a repurchase arrangement should be accounted for as a secured borrowing or a sale. The new guidance removes from the assessment of effective control the criterion requiring the transferor to have the ability to repurchase or redeem the financial assets on substantially agreed terms, even in the event of default by the transferee. This new guidance is effective prospectively for any of our applicable transactions, or modifications of existing transactions, that occur on or after January 1, 2012. We do not anticipate that this new guidance will have any significant impact on our consolidated financial statements. In May 2011, the FASB issued new guidance amending the existing pronouncement related to fair value measurement. This new guidance primarily expands the existing disclosure requirements for fair value. Specifically, the new guidance mandates the following additional disclosures: 1) the amount of any transfers between Level 1 and Level 2 of the fair value hierarchy, 2) a quantitative disclosure of the unobservable inputs and assumptions used in the measurement of Level 3 instruments, 3) a qualitative discussion of the sensitivity of the fair value to changes in unobservable inputs and any inter-relationships between those inputs that magnify or mitigate the effect on the measurement of Level 3 instruments and 4) the level within the fair value hierarchy, of items that are not measured at fair value in the statement of financial condition but whose fair value must be disclosed. This new guidance is effective for us prospectively beginning January 1, 2012. We expect the adoption of this new guidance will result in an increase of certain of our financial statement disclosures, but the adoption will not have any impact on our financial position or results of operations. 63 In June 2011, the FASB issued new guidance amending the existing pronouncement regarding the presentation of comprehensive income. This new guidance reduces the alternatives for the presentation of the components of other comprehensive income. Specifically, it eliminates the alternative of presenting them as part of the Statement of Changes in Shareholders Equity. This new guidance is effective for fiscal years and interim periods within those years, beginning December 15, 2011; however, early adoption is permitted. We currently present the components of other comprehensive income within our Consolidated Statements of Income and Comprehensive Income and, therefore, the adoption of this new guidance does not impact us. In September 2011, the FASB issued new guidance amending the existing pronouncement regarding the annual evaluation of goodwill for potential impairment. This new guidance adds a new optional step to the prior guidance. This new step is an optional qualitative assessment of whether it is more likely than not that the fair value of a reporting unit is less than its carrying amount before applying the two-step goodwill impairment test. If one concludes, based on qualitative factors, that it is not more likely than not that the fair value of a reporting unit is less than its carrying amount, then performing the two-step impairment test is not required. This new guidance is effective for annual and interim goodwill impairment tests performed for fiscal years beginning after December 15, 2011; early adoption is permitted. We chose not to adopt this new guidance in fiscal year 2011 since we had already completed our annual impairment testing under the prior guidance when this new guidance was issued. We do not expect our adoption of this new guidance in fiscal year 2012 to have any impact on our financial position or results of operations. Off-Balance Sheet arrangements Information concerning our off-balance sheet arrangements is included in Note 17 of the Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements. Such information is hereby incorporated by reference. Effects of inflation Our assets are primarily liquid in nature and are not significantly affected by inflation. However, the rate of inflation affects our expenses, including employee compensation, communications and occupancy, which may not be readily recoverable through charges for services we provide to our clients. 64
