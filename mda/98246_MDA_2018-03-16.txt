Item 7. Management's Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations. The following discussion and analysis should be read in conjunction with the Company's consolidated financial statements and related notes. All references to years relate to fiscal years which ended on January 31 of the following calendar year. KEY STRATEGIC PRIORITIES The Company's key strategic priorities are to: Amplify an evolved brand message. The Brand is the single most important asset of Tiffany and, indirectly, of the Company. Management intends to increasingly invest in and evolve marketing and public relations programs through a variety of media designed to build awareness of the Brand, its heritage and its products, as well as to enhance the Brand's association with quality and luxury by consumers. Renew the Company's product offerings and enhance in-store presentations. The Company's product development strategy is to accelerate the introduction of new design collections, primarily in jewelry, but also in non-jewelry products, and/or expand certain existing collections annually, all of which are intended to appeal to existing and new customers. To ensure a superior shopping experience, the Company is focused on enhancing the design of its stores, as well as the creative visual presentation of its merchandise, to provide an engaging luxury experience in both its new and existing stores. Deliver an exciting omnichannel customer experience. Management intends to continue to expand and optimize its global store base by evaluating potential markets for new TIFFANY & CO. stores, as well as through the renovation, relocation, or closing of existing stores. Management will also continue to pursue opportunities to grow sales through its e-commerce websites and utilize the websites to drive store traffic. In addition, the Company employs highly qualified sales and customer service professionals and is focused on developing effective omnichannel relationships with its customers. Strengthen the Company's competitive position and lead in key markets. The global jewelry industry is competitively fragmented. While the Company enjoys a strong reputation and large customer base, it encounters significant competition in all product categories and geographies. By focusing on enhanced marketing communications, product development and optimization of its store base and digital capabilities, the Company's objective is to be an industry leader in key markets. Cultivate a more efficient operating model. The Company is focused on improving its business operations through new systems, more effective processes and cost restraint, to drive margin growth. This includes realizing greater efficiencies in its product supply chain and other operations, and enhancing its global procurement capabilities. The Company has developed a substantial product supply infrastructure for the procurement and processing of diamonds and the manufacturing of jewelry. This infrastructure is intended to ensure adequate product supply and favorable product costs while adhering to the Company's quality and ethical standards. Inspire an aligned and agile organization to win. The Company's success depends upon its people and their effective execution of the Company's strategic priorities. The Company's management strives to motivate and develop employees with the core competencies and adaptability needed to achieve its objectives. TIFFANY & CO. K- 27 Table of Contents By pursuing these key strategic priorities, management is committed to the following long-term financial objectives: To achieve sustainable sales growth. Management's objective is to generate mid-single-digit percentage worldwide sales increases, primarily through comparable store sales growth, as well as through modest square footage growth. To increase retail productivity and profitability. Management is focused on increasing the frequency of store and website visits and the percentage of store and website visitors who make a purchase, as well as optimal utilization of store square footage, to grow sales and sales per square foot. To achieve improved operating margins, through both improved gross margin and efficient expense management. Management's long-term objective is to improve gross margin, including through controlling product input costs, realizing greater efficiencies in its product supply chain and adjusting retail prices when appropriate. Additionally, management is focused on efficient selling, general and administrative expense management, thereby generating sales leverage on fixed costs. These efforts are collectively intended to generate a higher rate of operating earnings growth relative to sales growth, and management targets an improvement in operating margin of 50 basis points per year over the long term. To improve inventory and other asset productivity and cash flow. Management's long-term objective is to maintain inventory growth at a rate less than sales growth, with greater focus on efficiencies in product sourcing and manufacturing as well as optimizing store inventory levels, all of which is intended to contribute to improvements in cash flow and return on assets. To maintain a capital structure that provides financial strength and the ability to invest in strategic initiatives, while also allowing for the return of excess capital to shareholders through dividends and share repurchases. 2017 SUMMARY Worldwide net sales increased 4% to $4.2 billion , reflecting sales growth in most reportable segments. Comparable store sales were unchanged from the prior year. There was no significant impact from currency translation (see "Non-GAAP Measures"). The Company added a net of two TIFFANY & CO. stores (opening five in Asia-Pacific, three in Europe and one in the Americas, while closing three in Asia-Pacific, two in the Americas and one each in Japan and the Emerging Markets and relocating seven stores), resulting in a 3% net increase in gross retail square footage. The Company expanded its product offerings, including by introducing the new TIFFANY HARDWEAR jewelry collection, through additions to several existing jewelry collections, such as the TIFFANY T collection, and by introducing its new Home and Accessories collection, new watch designs and a new fragrance. Earnings from operations as a percentage of net sales ("operating margin") increased 110 basis points, which includes the impact of certain impairment charges recorded in 2016, as described below under "Non-GAAP Measures". Excluding these charges, operating margin increased 10 basis points. Net earnings decreased 17% to $370.1 million , or $2.96 per diluted share. However, net earnings in 2017 included a net charge of $146.2 million, or $1.17 per diluted share related to the enactment of the 2017 U.S. Tax Cuts and Jobs Act (the "2017 Tax Act") (see "Non-GAAP Measures"). Net earnings in 2016 included impairment charges of $0.19 per diluted share (see "Non-GAAP Measures"). Excluding these charges, net earnings per diluted share increased 10% to $4.13. TIFFANY & CO. K- 28 Table of Contents Inventories, net increased 4% , with the majority of the increase attributed to currency translation. Cash flow from operating activities was $932.2 million in 2017 , compared with $705.7 million in 2016 . Free cash flow (see "Non-GAAP Measures") was $692.9 million in 2017 , compared with $482.9 million in 2016 . The Company returned capital to shareholders by paying regular quarterly dividends (which were increased 11% effective July 2017 to $0.50 per share, or an annualized rate of $2.00 per share) and by repurchasing 1.0 million shares of its Common Stock for $99.2 million. RESULTS OF OPERATIONS Non-GAAP Measures The Company reports information in accordance with U.S. Generally Accepted Accounting Principles ("GAAP"). Internally, management also monitors and measures its performance using certain sales and earnings measures that include or exclude amounts, or are subject to adjustments that have the effect of including or excluding amounts, from the most directly comparable GAAP measure ("non-GAAP financial measures"). The Company presents such non-GAAP financial measures in reporting its financial results to provide investors with useful supplemental information that will allow them to evaluate the Company's operating results using the same measures that management uses to monitor and measure its performance. The Company's management does not, nor does it suggest that investors should, consider non-GAAP financial measures in isolation from, or as a substitute for, financial information prepared in accordance with GAAP. These non-GAAP financial measures presented here may not be comparable to similarly-titled measures used by other companies. TIFFANY & CO. K- 29 Table of Contents Net Sales . The Company's reported net sales reflect either a translation-related benefit from strengthening foreign currencies or a detriment from a strengthening U.S. dollar. Internally, management monitors and measures its sales performance on a non-GAAP basis that eliminates the positive or negative effects that result from translating sales made outside the U.S. into U.S. dollars ("constant-exchange-rate basis"). Sales on a constant-exchange-rate basis are calculated by taking the current year's sales in local currencies and translating them into U.S. dollars using the prior year's foreign currency exchange rates. Management believes this constant-exchange-rate basis provides a useful supplemental basis for the assessment of sales performance and of comparability between reporting periods. The following table reconciles the sales percentage increases (decreases) from the GAAP to the non-GAAP basis versus the previous year: 2017 2016 GAAP Reported Translation Effect Constant- Exchange- Rate Basis GAAP Reported Translation Effect Constant- Exchange- Rate Basis Net Sales: Worldwide 4 % % 4 % (3 )% % (3 )% Americas 2 1 1 (5 ) (5 ) Asia-Pacific 10 2 8 (1 ) 1 Japan (1 ) (2 ) 1 12 12 Europe 6 3 3 (10 ) (7 ) (3 ) Other 26 26 (8 ) (8 ) Comparable Store Sales: Worldwide % % % (5 )% % (5 )% Americas 1 1 (6 ) (1 ) (5 ) Asia-Pacific (1 ) 1 (2 ) (9 ) (2 ) (7 ) Japan (1 ) (3 ) 2 16 11 5 Europe (2 ) 2 (4 ) (14 ) (5 ) (9 ) Other 2 2 (15 ) (15 ) Statements of Earnings. Internally, management monitors and measures its earnings performance excluding certain items listed below. Management believes excluding such items provides a useful supplemental basis for the assessment of the Company's results relative to the corresponding period in the prior year. The following tables reconcile certain GAAP amounts to non-GAAP amounts: (in millions, except per share amounts) GAAP Charges related to the 2017 Tax Act a Non-GAAP Year Ended January 31, 2018 Provision for income taxes $ 390.4 $ (146.2 ) $ 244.2 Effective income tax rate 51.3 % (19.2 )% 32.1 % Net earnings 370.1 146.2 516.3 Diluted earnings per share* 2.96 1.17 4.13 a Net expense recognized in 2017 related to the estimated impact of the 2017 Tax Act.

TIFFANY & CO. K- 31 Table of Contents Free Cash Flow. Internally, management monitors its cash flow on a non-GAAP basis. Free cash flow is calculated by deducting capital expenditures from net cash provided by operating activities. The ability to generate free cash flow demonstrates how much cash the Company has available for discretionary and non-discretionary purposes after deduction of capital expenditures. The Company's operations require regular capital expenditures for the opening, renovation and expansion of stores and distribution and manufacturing facilities as well as ongoing investments in information technology. Management believes this provides a useful supplemental basis for assessing the Company's operating cash flows. The following table reconciles GAAP net cash provided by operating activities to non-GAAP free cash flow: ( in millions) 2017 2016 Net cash provided by operating activities $ 932.2 $ 705.7 Less: Capital expenditures (239.3 ) (222.8 ) Free cash flow a $ 692.9 $ 482.9 a Net cash provided by operating activities and free cash flow in 2017 reflected more effective management and timing of payables and reduced payments for income taxes, partly offset by increased inventory purchases. Additionally, net cash provided by operating activities and free cash flow in 2017 and 2016 reflected a voluntary cash contribution of $15.0 million and $120.0 million, respectively, made by the Company to its U.S. pension plan (See "Item 8. Financial Statements and Supplementary Data - Note N. Employee Benefit Plans"). Comparable Store Sales Comparable store sales include only sales transacted in Company-operated stores open for more than 12 months. Sales for relocated stores are included in comparable store sales if the relocation occurs within the same geographical market. Sales for a new store are not included in comparable store sales if that store was relocated from one department store to another or from a department store to a free-standing location. In all markets, the results of a store in which the square footage has been expanded or reduced remain in the comparable store base. Net Sales The Company generates sales through its retail, Internet, wholesale, business-to-business and catalog channels (see "Item 1. Business - Financial Information about Reportable Segments"). Net sales by segment were as follows: (in millions) 2017 % of Total Net Sales 2016 % of Total Net Sales 2015 % of Total Net Sales 2017 vs 2016 % Change in Net Sales 2016 vs 2015 % Change in Net Sales Americas $ 1,870.9 45 % $ 1,841.9 46 % $ 1,947.0 47 % 2 % (5 )% Asia-Pacific 1,095.0 26 999.1 25 1,003.1 24 10 Japan 596.3 14 604.4 15 541.3 13 (1 ) 12 Europe 482.9 12 457.6 11 505.7 12 6 (10 ) Other 124.7 3 98.8 3 107.8 4 26 (8 ) $ 4,169.8 $ 4,001.8 $ 4,104.9 4 % (3 )% TIFFANY & CO. K- 32 Table of Contents Net Sales 2017 compared with 2016 . In 2017 , worldwide net sales increased $168.0 million , or 4% , reflecting an increase in net sales in most reportable segments. There was no impact from foreign currency translation on worldwide net sales. In 2017, jewelry sales represented 91% of worldwide net sales. Changes in jewelry sales by product category relative to the prior year were as follows: (in millions) $ Change % Change Jewelry collections $ 149.3 7 % Engagement jewelry (56.6 ) (5 ) Designer jewelry 22.1 4 The increase in net sales of Jewelry collections was driven primarily by the Tiffany HardWear and Tiffany T collections, while the Engagement jewelry category reflected decreases across the category. The Designer jewelry category reflected increases across the category. The Jewelry collections category reflects the combination of the previously reported high, fine & solitaire jewelry and fashion jewelry categories. Additionally, jewelry bearing the name of and attributed to Jean Schlumberger, which was previously reported within the high, fine & solitaire jewelry category, has been reclassified into the Designer jewelry category. Such changes or reclassifications have been made to conform with management's current internal analysis of product sales. Changes in net sales by reportable segment were as follows: (in millions) Comparable Store Sales Non-comparable Store Sales Wholesale/ E-Commerce/Other Total Americas $ 8.3 $ (0.8 ) $ 21.5 $ 29.0 Asia-Pacific (8.0 ) 38.8 65.1 95.9 Japan (5.1 ) (2.5 ) (0.5 ) (8.1 ) Europe (6.3 ) 22.1 9.5 25.3 In 2017, jewelry sales represented 89%, 99%, 91% and 97% of total net sales in the Americas, Asia-Pacific, Japan and Europe, respectively.

In 2017 , total net sales increased $29.0 million , or 2% , which included comparable store sales increasing $8.3 million , or 1% . The total net sales increase was primarily due to increased e-commerce sales growth in the U.S. and comparable store sales growth. Management attributed performance in this region to an increase in spending by local customers. On a constant-exchange-rate basis, total net sales increased 1% and comparable store sales were unchanged. The increase in the number of jewelry units sold reflected increases in the Jewelry collections and Designer jewelry categories. The decrease in average price per jewelry unit sold reflected decreases across all categories. TIFFANY & CO. K- 33 Table of Contents Asia-Pacific. In 2017 , total net sales increased $95.9 million , or 10% , which included comparable store sales decreasing $8.0 million , or 1% . Total net sales growth was due to increased wholesale sales, primarily in Korea, and the effect of new stores, while comparable store sales reflected growth in mainland China offset by declines in most other countries. Management attributed the declines in other Asia-Pacific countries partly to lower spending by Chinese tourists. On a constant-exchange-rate basis, total net sales increased 8% and comparable store sales decreased 2% . The increase in the number of jewelry units sold reflected increases in Jewelry collections and the Designer jewelry categories. Management attributed the decrease in the average price per jewelry unit sold to a shift in sales mix to the Jewelry collections and Designer jewelry categories that partly resulted from the increase in wholesale sales noted above. Japan. In 2017 , total net sales decreased $8.1 million , or 1% , which included comparable store sales decreasing $5.1 million , or 1% . The sales declines reflected the negative effect of currency translation. On a constant-exchange-rate basis, total net sales increased 1% and comparable store sales increased 2% . The decrease in the number of jewelry units sold primarily reflected decreases in the Jewelry collections and the Designer jewelry categories, partly offset by increases in the Engagement jewelry category Europe. In 2017 , total net sales increased $25.3 million , or 6% , which included comparable store sales decreasing $6.3 million , or 2% , each benefiting from the positive effect of currency translation. Total net sales growth also reflected the effect of new stores and e-commerce sales growth. Management attributed retail sales growth to higher spending by local customers. On a constant-exchange-rate basis, total net sales increased 3% while comparable store sales decreased 4% , due to similar trends noted above. The increase in the number of jewelry units sold reflected increases across all categories. Management attributed the increase in average price per unit sold to the positive effect of currency translation. Other. In 2017 , total net sales increased $25.9 million , or 26% , primarily due to an increase in wholesale sales of diamonds. Net Sales 2016 compared with 2015 . In 2016, worldwide net sales decreased $103.1 million, or 3%, reflecting declines in the Americas and Europe, an increase in Japan and unchanged sales in Asia-Pacific. There was no significant impact from foreign currency translation on worldwide net sales. In 2016, jewelry sales represented 92% of worldwide net sales.

In 2016, total net sales decreased $105.1 million, or 5%, which management attributed to lower sales to U.S. customers and foreign tourist spending (primarily Chinese tourists). Comparable store sales decreased $96.1 million, or 6%. On a constant-exchange-rate basis, both total net sales and comparable store sales decreased 5%. The decrease in the number of jewelry units sold reflected declines across all categories. Asia-Pacific. In 2016, total net sales were approximately equal to the prior year, decreasing $4.0 million, partly reflecting new stores and increased wholesale sales; comparable store sales decreased $80.1 million, or 9%. Management attributed performance in this region to increased purchasing by local customers and declines in spending by foreign tourists. In addition, total net sales growth included sales growth in China, increased wholesale sales in Korea, a decelerating rate of retail sales declines in Hong Kong and varying performance in other countries. On a constant-exchange-rate basis, total net sales increased 1% and comparable store sales decreased 7%. The increase in the number of jewelry units sold reflected increases in the Jewelry collections category and in wedding bands within the Engagement jewelry category. Management attributed the decrease in the average price per jewelry unit sold to a shift in mix within the Jewelry collections category and within the Engagement jewelry category toward wedding bands. Japan. In 2016, total net sales increased $63.1 million, or 12%, and comparable store sales increased $78.8 million, or 16%. On a constant-exchange-rate basis, total net sales were in line with prior year and comparable store sales increased 5%. Management attributed this performance to higher spending by local customers and lower spending by Chinese tourists, as well as lower wholesale sales. The increase in number of jewelry units sold reflected increases across all categories. Management attributed the decrease in the average price per jewelry unit sold to a shift in sales mix to the Designer jewelry category, as well as a shift in sales mix within the Jewelry collections category. Europe. In 2016, total net sales decreased $48.1 million, or 10%, and comparable store sales decreased $59.7 million, or 14%, which management attributed to lower spending by foreign tourists and local customers across continental Europe. On a constant-exchange-rate basis, total net sales decreased 3% and comparable store sales TIFFANY & CO. K- 35 Table of Contents decreased 9%, as softness across continental Europe was partially offset by sales increases in the U.K. (particularly in the second half of the year, largely attributable to foreign tourist spending). The decrease in the number of jewelry units sold reflected decreases across all categories. Management attributed the decrease in average price per unit sold to the negative effect of currency translation, which offset a favorable shift toward higher-priced products within the Engagement jewelry category. Other. In 2016, total net sales decreased $9.0 million, or 8%, partly due to a $16.9 million, or 22%, sales decline in the Emerging Markets region, partly offset by an increase in wholesale sales of diamonds. Store Data . In 2017 , the Company increased gross retail square footage by 3%, net, through store openings, closings and relocations. The Company opened nine stores and closed seven: opening five in Asia-Pacific (two in China, two in Australia and one in Korea), three in Europe (one each in Italy, Russia and the U.K.) and one in the Americas (in the U.S.) while closing three stores in Asia-Pacific (one each in China, Korea and Taiwan), two stores in the Americas (in the U.S.) and one each in Japan and the Emerging Markets. In addition, the Company relocated seven existing stores. In 2016 , the Company increased gross retail square footage by 3%, net, through store openings, closings and relocations. The Company opened 11 stores and closed five: opening seven in Asia-Pacific (three in China, two in Australia and one each in Korea and New Zealand), three in Europe (two in Italy and one in the Netherlands) and one in the Americas (in Canada) while closing three stores in Asia-Pacific (two in China and one in Singapore) and one each in Japan and Europe (in Germany). In addition, the Company relocated five existing stores. Sales per gross square foot generated by all company-operated stores were approximately $2,700 in 2017 , $2,700 in 2016 and $2,900 in 2015 . The decline in 2016 reflected the effects of decreased sales and growth in retail square footage. Excluded from the store counts and sales per gross square foot amounts above are pop-up stores (stores with lease terms of 24 months or less). Gross Margin (in millions) 2017 2016 2015 Gross profit $ 2,604.7 $ 2,490.3 $ 2,491.3 Gross profit as a percentage of net sales 62.5 % 62.2 % 60.7 % Gross margin (gross profit as a percentage of net sales) increased 30 basis points in 2017 due to favorable product input costs, partly offset by the dilutive effects from increases in sales for wholesale distribution (merchandise sold to independent distributors for resale) and in wholesale sales of diamonds, as well as increases in certain product-related costs, including inventory reserves and distribution and logistics. Gross margin increased 150 basis points in 2016 reflecting favorable product input costs and the effect of price increases, and, to a lesser extent, favorable changes in product sales mix. Management periodically reviews and adjusts its retail prices when appropriate to address product input cost increases, specific market conditions and changes in foreign currencies/U.S. dollar relationships. Its long-term strategy is to continue that approach, although significant increases in product input costs or weakening foreign currencies can affect gross margin negatively over the short-term until management makes necessary price adjustments. Among the market conditions that management considers are consumer demand for the product category involved, which may be influenced by consumer confidence, and competitive pricing conditions. Management uses derivative instruments to mitigate certain foreign exchange and precious metal price exposures (see "Item 8. Financial Statements and Supplementary Data Note H. Hedging Instruments"). Management increased retail prices in both 2017 and 2016 across most geographic regions and product categories, some of which were intended to mitigate foreign currency fluctuations. TIFFANY & CO. K- 36 Table of Contents Selling, General and Administrative Expenses (in millions) 2017 2016 2015 As reported: SG&A expenses $ 1,810.2 $ 1,769.1 $ 1,731.2 SG&A expenses as a percentage of net sales ("SG&A expense ratio") 43.4 % 44.2 % 42.2 % Excluding other operating expenses*: SG&A expenses $ 1,810.2 $ 1,731.1 $ 1,684.5 SG&A expense ratio 43.4 % 43.3 % 41.0 % *See "Non-GAAP Measures" above for a description of such excluded operating expenses. SG&A expenses increased $41.1 million , or 2% , in 2017 and $37.9 million , or 2% , in 2016 . SG&A expenses in 2016 and 2015 included certain other operating expenses. See "Non-GAAP Measures" for further details. SG&A expenses in 2017 increased $79.1 million, or 5%, compared to 2016 (excluding the 2016 items noted in "Non-GAAP Measures"), largely reflecting increased labor and incentive compensation costs, store occupancy and depreciation expenses and marketing costs. There was no significant effect on SG&A expense changes from foreign currency translation. SG&A expenses in 2016 increased $46.6 million, or 3%, compared to 2015 (excluding the 2016 and 2015 items noted in "Non-GAAP Measures"), largely reflecting increased store occupancy and depreciation expenses and labor and incentive compensation costs. There was no significant effect on SG&A expense changes from foreign currency translation. The Company's SG&A expenses are largely fixed or controllable in nature (including, but not limited to, marketing costs, employees' salaries and benefits, fixed store rent and depreciation expenses), with the total of such costs representing approximately 80 - 85% of total SG&A expenses, and the remainder comprised of variable items (including, but not limited to, variable store rent, sales commissions and fees paid to credit card companies). Earnings from Operations (dollars in millions) 2017 2016 2015 As reported: Earnings from operations $ 794.5 $ 721.2 $ 760.1 Operating margin 19.1 % 18.0 % 18.5 % Basis point change from prior year 110 (50 ) (250 ) Excluding other operating expenses*: Earnings from operations $ 794.5 $ 759.2 $ 806.8 Operating margin 19.1 % 19.0 % 19.7 % Basis point change from prior year 10 (70 ) (130 ) *See "Non-GAAP Measures" above for a description of such excluded operating expenses. The increase in operating margin in 2017 reflected impairment charges recorded in 2016 (see "Non-GAAP Measures"). When excluding such charges, the slight increase in 2017 resulted from a higher gross margin partly offset by an increase in the SG&A expense ratio. The decline in operating margin in 2016 resulted from sales deleveraging of SG&A expenses, which were only partly offset by higher gross margins. TIFFANY & CO.

On a segment basis, the ratio of earnings from operations to each segment's net sales in 2017 compared with 2016 was as follows: Americas the ratio increased 60 basis points due to an improvement in gross margin, partly offset by sales deleverage on operating expenses; Asia-Pacific the ratio increased 50 basis points due to sales leverage on operating expenses, partly offset by a decrease in gross margin, both attributable to increased wholesale sales in the region; Japan the ratio increased 90 basis points due to an increase in gross margin (which includes the effect of changes in foreign currency exchange rates on inventory purchases), partly offset by sales deleverage on operating expenses; and Europe the ratio increased 10 basis points due to an increase in gross margin, largely offset by a sales deleverage on operating expenses. On a segment basis, the ratio of earnings from operations to each segment's net sales in 2016 compared with 2015 was as follows: Americas the ratio increased 20 basis points due to an improvement in gross margin, largely offset by a lack of sales leverage on operating expenses resulting from a decrease in net sales; Asia-Pacific the ratio decreased 80 basis points due to a lack of sales leverage on operating expenses, primarily attributable to new store-related expenses, partly offset by an improvement in gross margin; Japan the ratio decreased 300 basis points primarily due to a decrease in gross margin that reflected an unfavorable impact tied to the strengthening of the Yen on the Company's program to utilize Yen forward contracts for a portion of its forecasted merchandise purchases; and Europe the ratio decreased 150 basis points due to a decrease in net sales resulting in a lack of sales leverage on operating expenses, partly offset by an improvement in gross margin. Unallocated corporate expenses include costs related to administrative support functions which the Company does not allocate to its segments. Such unallocated costs include those for centralized information technology, finance, legal and human resources departments. Unallocated corporate expenses increased by $19.9 million in 2017 due TIFFANY & CO. K- 38 Table of Contents to an increase in charitable donations to the Tiffany & Co. Foundation, a private foundation organized to support 501(c)(3) charitable organizations, increased costs associated with upgrades to the Company's information technology systems and higher severance costs associated with changes in corporate management. Such expenses increased $9.8 million in 2016, primarily due to increased costs, including depreciation and amortization expense, associated with upgrades to the Company's information technology systems as well as increased incentive compensation expense. Included in other operating expenses in the table above, the 2016 amount represented $25.4 million associated with an impairment charge related to software costs capitalized in connection with the development of a new finished goods inventory management and merchandising information system (see "Item 8. Financial Statements and Supplementary Data - Note B. Summary of Significant Accounting Policies and Note E. Property, Plant and Equipment") and $12.6 million associated with impairment charges related to financing arrangements with diamond mining and exploration companies (see "Item 8. Financial Statements and Supplementary Data - Note B. Summary of Significant Accounting Policies"). Included in other operating expenses in the table above, the 2015 amount represented $37.9 million associated with impairment charges related to a financing arrangement with Koidu Limited (see "Item 8. Financial Statements and Supplementary Data - Note B. Summary of Significant Accounting Policies") and $8.8 million of expenses associated with specific cost-reduction initiatives (see "Item 8. Financial Statements and Supplementary Data - Note J. Commitments and Contingencies"). Interest Expense and Financing Costs Interest expense and financing costs decreased $4.0 million , or 9% , in 2017 and $3.0 million , or 6% , in 2016 . Other (Income) Expense, Net Other (income) expense, net includes interest income as well as gains/losses on investment activities and foreign currency transactions. Net other income of $8.0 million in 2017 compared with net other income of $1.4 million in 2016. The $6.6 million increase in 2017 was primarily due to gains on sales of marketable securities and an increase in interest income. Net other income of $1.4 million in 2016 compared with net other expense of $1.2 million in 2015. The $2.6 million change was primarily due to reduced foreign currency transaction losses. Provision for Income Taxes On December 22, 2017, the 2017 Tax Act was enacted in the U.S. This enactment resulted in a number of significant changes to U.S. federal income tax law for U.S. taxpayers. On the same date, the SEC issued Staff Accounting Bulletin No. 118 ("SAB 118"), which addresses the application of U.S. GAAP in situations in which a registrant does not have necessary information available, prepared, or analyzed (including computations) in reasonable detail to complete the accounting for certain income tax effects of the 2017 Tax Act. Changes in tax law are accounted for in the period of enactment. As such, the 2017 consolidated financial statements reflect the estimated immediate tax effect of the 2017 Tax Act. See "Item 8. Financial Statements and Supplementary Data - Note O. Income Taxes" for additional information on the provisions and impacts of the 2017 Tax Act and SAB 118. The effective income tax rate was 51.3% in 2017 compared with 34.1% in 2016 and 34.7% in 2015 . The effective income tax rate in 2017 reflected the impact of a $146.2 million net charge, or $1.17 per diluted share, related to the enactment of the 2017 Tax Act in December 2017. The net charge recorded includes: Estimated tax expense of $94.8 million, or $0.76 per diluted share, for the impact of the reduction in the U.S. tax rate on the Company deferred tax assets and liabilities, Estimated tax expense of $56.0 million, or $0.45 per diluted share, for the one-time transition tax effected via a mandatory deemed repatriation of post-1986 undistributed foreign earnings and profits ("Transition Tax"), and A tax benefit of $4.6 million, or $0.04 per diluted share, resulting from the effect of the 21% statutory tax rate for the month of January 2018 on the Company annual statutory tax rate for the year ended January TIFFANY & CO. K- 39 Table of Contents 31, 2018. Because the Company fiscal year ended on January 31, 2018, the Company statutory tax rate for fiscal 2017 is 33.8%, rather than 35.0%. Excluding this net charge, the effective income tax rate was 32.1% (see "Non-GAAP Measures"). This differs from the effective tax rate in 2016 of 34.1% primarily due to an increase in the domestic manufacturing deduction, the implementation of ASU 2016-09, which now requires excess tax benefits and/or shortfalls related to exercises and vesting of share-based compensation to be recorded in the provision for income taxes rather than in additional paid-in capital and lower state taxes, partially offset by the impact of a change in uncertain tax positions primarily attributable to the conclusion of a tax examination during the first quarter of 2016. In connection with the implementation of ASU 2016-09, the Company recognized an income tax benefit of $6.8 million, or $0.05 per diluted share, in 2017. In connection with the conclusion of the tax examination during the first quarter of 2016, the Company recognized an income tax benefit of $6.6 million, or $0.05 per diluted share. LIQUIDITY AND CAPITAL RESOURCES The Company's liquidity needs have been, and are expected to remain, primarily a function of its ongoing, seasonal and expansion-related working capital requirements and capital expenditure needs. Over the long term, the Company manages its cash and capital structure to maintain a strong financial position that provides flexibility to pursue strategic priorities. Management regularly assesses its working capital needs, capital expenditure requirements, debt service, dividend payouts, share repurchases and future investments. Management believes that cash on hand, internally generated cash flows, the funds available under its revolving credit facilities and the ability to access the debt and capital markets are sufficient to support the Company's liquidity and capital requirements for the foreseeable future. At January 31, 2018 , the Company's cash and cash equivalents totaled $970.7 million , of which approximately 25% was held in locations outside the U.S. where, prior to the enactment of the 2017 Tax Act, the Company had asserted to indefinitely reinvest any undistributed earnings to support its continued expansion and investments in such foreign locations. As a result of the 2017 Tax Act, the Company is currently evaluating such assertion. This evaluation is incomplete and will be completed during the measurement period allowed for under SAB 118. If the Company's assertion to indefinitely reinvest earnings is maintained, such cash balances would not be available to fund U.S. cash requirements unless the Company were to decide to repatriate such funds and incur applicable tax charges. The applicable tax charges may include withholding taxes and tax on foreign currency gains and losses. The Company believes it has sufficient sources of cash in the U.S. to fund its U.S. operations without the need to repatriate any of those funds held outside the U.S. See "Item 8. Financial Statements and Supplementary Data - Note O. Income Taxes" for additional information. In addition, the Company had Short-term investments of $320.5 million at January 31, 2018 compared with $57.8 million at January 31, 2017. The following table summarizes cash flows from operating, investing and financing activities: (in millions) 2017 2016 2015 Net cash provided by (used in): Operating activities $ 932.2 $ 705.7 $ 817.4 Investing activities (481.1 ) (236.8 ) (278.2 ) Financing activities (421.1 ) (386.4 ) (426.1 ) Effect of exchange rates on cash and cash equivalents 12.7 1.9 0.5 Net increase in cash and cash equivalents $ 42.7 $ 84.4 $ 113.6 TIFFANY & CO. K- 40 Table of Contents Operating Activities The Company had net cash inflows from operating activities of $932.2 million in 2017 , $705.7 million in 2016 and $817.4 million in 2015 . The increase in 2017 compared to 2016 reflected more effective management and timing of payables and reduced payments for income taxes, partly offset by increased inventory purchases. Additionally, the Company made a $15.0 million voluntary cash contribution to its U.S. pension plan in the third quarter of 2017. The decrease in 2016 compared to 2015 was primarily due to a $120.0 million voluntary contribution made by the Company to its U.S. pension plan in 2016. Working Capital. Working capital (current assets less current liabilities) increased to $3.3 billion at January 31, 2018 from $2.9 billion at January 31, 2017 . The increase in 2017 was due to an increase in Short-term investments and a decrease in Short-term borrowings. Accounts receivable, less allowances at January 31, 2018 were 2% higher than at January 31, 2017 . Currency translation had the effect of increasing accounts receivable, less allowances by 4% from January 31, 2017 . Inventories, net at January 31, 2018 were 4% higher than at January 31, 2017 , which reflected similar increases in both finished goods inventories and combined raw material and work-in-process inventories. Currency translation had the effect of increasing inventories, net by 3% from January 31, 2017 . Accounts payable and accrued liabilities at January 31, 2018 were 40% higher than at January 31, 2017 , which reflected more effective management of payables, as well as the timing of payments. Investing Activities The Company had net cash outflows from investing activities of $481.1 million in 2017 , $236.8 million in 2016 and $278.2 million in 2015 . The increase in net cash outflows in 2017 compared to 2016 was driven by increased net purchases of marketable securities and short-term investments. The decrease in net cash outflows in 2016 compared to 2015 was driven by decreased capital expenditures as well as reduced net purchases of marketable securities and short-term investments. Marketable Securities and Short-Term Investments. The Company invests a portion of its cash in marketable securities and short-term investments. The Company had $246.6 million of net purchases of marketable securities and short-term investments during 2017 , compared with $15.7 million during 2016 and $26.4 million during 2015. Capital Expenditures. Capital expenditures are typically related to the opening, renovation and/or relocation of stores (which represented approximately 60%, 60% and 50% of capital expenditures in 2017, 2016 and 2015, respectively), as well as distribution and manufacturing facilities and ongoing investments in information technology. Capital expenditures were $239.3 million in 2017 , $222.8 million in 2016 and $252.7 million in 2015 , representing 6% of worldwide net sales in each year. Financing Activities The Company had net cash outflows from financing activities of $421.1 million in 2017 , $386.4 million in 2016 and $426.1 million in 2015 . TIFFANY & CO. K- 41 Table of Contents Recent Borrowings. The Company had net (repayments of) proceeds from short-term and long-term borrowings as follows: (in millions) 2017 2016 2015 Short-term borrowings: (Repayments of) proceeds from credit facility borrowings, net $ (67.8 ) $ 14.2 $ (11.3 ) Proceeds from other credit facility borrowings 39.2 76.8 24.8 Repayments of other credit facility borrowings (96.1 ) (83.1 ) (16.0 ) Net (repayments of) proceeds from short-term borrowings (124.7 ) 7.9 (2.5 ) Long-term borrowings: Proceeds from the issuance of long-term debt 98.1 Repayment of long-term debt (97.1 ) Net proceeds from long-term borrowings 1.0 Net (repayments of) proceeds from total borrowings $ (124.7 ) $ 8.9 $ (2.5 ) Credit Facilities. In 2014, the Registrant entered into a four-year $375.0 million and a five-year $375.0 million multi-bank, multi-currency, committed unsecured revolving credit facility, including letter of credit subfacilities (collectively, the "Credit Facilities"), resulting in a total borrowing capacity of $750.0 million. In October 2016, the maturity for each of the Credit Facilities was extended for one additional year pursuant to the terms set forth in the respective agreements governing the Credit Facilities. Therefore, the four-year and five-year Credit Facilities will mature in October of 2019 and 2020, respectively. Commercial Paper. In August 2017, the Registrant and one of its wholly owned subsidiaries established a commercial paper program (the "Commercial Paper Program") for the issuance of commercial paper in the form of short-term promissory notes in an aggregate principal amount not to exceed $750.0 million. Borrowings under the Commercial Paper Program are used for general corporate purposes. The aggregate amount of borrowings that the Company is currently authorized to have outstanding under the Commercial Paper Program and the Credit Facilities is $750.0 million. The Registrant guarantees the obligations of its wholly owned subsidiary under the Commercial Paper Program. Maturities of commercial paper notes may vary, but cannot exceed 397 days from the date of issuance. Notes issued under the Commercial Paper Program rank equally with the Registrant's present and future unsecured and unsubordinated indebtedness. Other Credit Facilities. In 2016, the Registrant's wholly owned subsidiary, Tiffany & Co. (Shanghai) Commercial Company Limited ("Tiffany-Shanghai"), entered into a three-year multi-bank revolving credit agreement (the "Tiffany-Shanghai Credit Agreement"). The Tiffany-Shanghai Credit Agreement has an aggregate borrowing limit of RMB 990.0 million ( $156.5 million at January 31, 2018 ) and matures in July 2019. Under all of the Company's credit facilities and the Commercial Paper Program, at January 31, 2018 , there were $120.6 million of borrowings outstanding, $6.8 million of letters of credit issued but not outstanding and $918.1 million available for borrowing. At January 31, 2017 , there were $228.7 million of borrowings outstanding, $4.0 million of letters of credit issued but not outstanding and $798.4 million available for borrowing. The weighted-average interest rate for borrowings outstanding was 4.35% at January 31, 2018 and 2.71% at January 31, 2017 . Senior Notes. In August 2016, the Registrant issued 10.0 billion ( $91.9 million at January 31, 2018 ) of 0.78% Senior Notes due August 2026 (the "Yen Notes") in a private transaction. The Yen Notes bear interest at a rate of 0.78% per annum, payable semi-annually on February 26 and August 26 of each year, commencing February 26, 2017. The proceeds from the issuance of the Yen Notes were used to repay the Registrant's 10.0 billion 1.72% Senior Notes due September 2016 upon the maturity thereof. The ratio of total debt (short-term borrowings and long-term debt) to stockholders' equity was 31% at January 31, 2018 and 37% at 2017 . At January 31, 2018 , the Company was in compliance with all debt covenants. TIFFANY & CO. K- 42 Table of Contents For additional information regarding all of the Company's credit facilities, senior note issuances and other outstanding indebtedness, see "Item 8. Financial Statements and Supplementary Data - Note G. Debt." Share Repurchases. In March 2014, the Company's Board of Directors approved a share repurchase program (the "2014 Program"), which authorized the Company to repurchase up to $300.0 million of its Common Stock through open market transactions. The 2014 Program had an expiration date of March 31, 2017, but was terminated in January 2016 in connection with the authorization of a new program with increased repurchase capacity (as described in more detail below). Approximately $58.6 million remained available for repurchase under the 2014 Program at the time of its termination. In January 2016, the Company's Board of Directors approved a new share repurchase program (the "2016 Program"), which authorizes the Company to repurchase up to $500.0 million of its Common Stock through open market transactions, block trades or privately negotiated transactions and terminated the 2014 Program. Purchases under the 2014 Program were, and purchases under the 2016 Program have been, executed under a written plan for trading securities as specified under Rule 10b5-1 promulgated under the Securities and Exchange Act of 1934, as amended, the terms of which are within the Company's discretion, subject to applicable securities laws, and are based on market conditions and the Company's liquidity needs. The 2016 Program will expire on January 31, 2019. At January 31, 2018 , $211.2 million remained available for repurchase under the 2016 Program. The Company's share repurchase activity was as follows: (in millions, except per share amounts) 2017 2016 2015 Cost of repurchases $ 99.2 $ 183.6 $ 220.4 Shares repurchased and retired 1.0 2.8 2.8 Average cost per share $ 94.86 $ 65.24 $ 78.40 Proceeds from exercised stock options. The Company's proceeds from exercised stock options were $54.6 million , $15.3 million and $2.0 million in 2017, 2016 and 2015, respectively. Dividends. The cash dividend on the Company's Common Stock was increased once in each of 2017 , 2016 and 2015 . The Company's Board of Directors declared quarterly dividends which totaled $1.95, $1.75 and $1.58 per common share in 2017 , 2016 and 2015 , respectively, with cash dividends paid of $242.6 million , $218.8 million and $203.4 million in those respective years. The dividend payout ratio (dividends as a percentage of net earnings) was 66% , 49% and 44% in 2017 , 2016 and 2015 , respectively. Dividends as a percentage of adjusted net earnings (see "Non-GAAP Measures") were 47%, 47% and 41% in 2017, 2016 and 2015, respectively. At least annually, the Company's Board of Directors reviews its policies with respect to dividends and share repurchases with a view to actual and projected earnings, cash flows and capital requirements. Financing Arrangements with Diamond Mining and Exploration Companies The Company provided financing to diamond mining and exploration companies in order to obtain rights to purchase the output from mines owned by these companies. At January 31, 2017, there was $43.8 million of principal outstanding under a financing arrangement (the "Loan") with Koidu Limited (previously Koidu Holdings S.A.) ("Koidu"). However, the Company recorded impairment charges totaling $4.2 million and $37.9 million during the fiscal years ended January 31, 2017 and 2016, respectively, related to the Loan and ceased accruing interest income on the loan as of July 2015, resulting in a net carrying amount of the Loan of $1.7 million at January 31, 2017. In 2017, the Company sold its interest in the Loan to Koidu's largest creditor for $1.7 million. Additionally, the Company and Koidu entered into an agreement to terminate the supply agreement between the parties, pursuant to which Laurelton Diamonds, Inc., a wholly owned subsidiary of the Company, had previously been required to purchase at fair market value certain diamonds recovered from the mine operated by Koidu that met Laurelton's quality standards. The Company also recorded an impairment charge of $8.4 million during the fiscal year ended January 31, 2017 related to a separate financing arrangement with another diamond mining and exploration company. TIFFANY & CO. K- 43 Table of Contents Impairment charges recorded on such arrangements were not significant during the fiscal year ended January 31, 2018. Information Systems Assessment The Company is engaged in a multi-year program to evaluate and, where appropriate, upgrade and/or replace certain of its information systems. As part of this program, the Company identified opportunities to enhance its finished goods inventory management and merchandising capabilities, and began development efforts to replace certain of its existing systems and provide these enhanced capabilities. In 2016, the Company completed an assessment of the replacement system that was under development to evaluate whether the continued development of this system would deliver sufficiently improved operating capabilities. Following the completion of this assessment, in the fourth quarter of 2016, the Company concluded that the development of this system should be modified such that the finished goods inventory management and merchandising capabilities that were intended to be delivered utilizing this new system will instead be delivered through further development of the Company's current Enterprise Resource Planning system and continued implementation of a new order management system. Accordingly, the Company evaluated the costs capitalized for the development of the replacement system for impairment in accordance with its policy on the review of long-lived assets, and determined, based on specific identification of costs capitalized pertaining to the development of specific capabilities in the new system, that $25.4 million of such capitalized costs related to software functionality which will not be utilized, and therefore will not have future benefit to the Company. As such, the Company recorded a pre-tax impairment charge of $25.4 million as a component of Selling, General and Administrative expenses in the fourth quarter of 2016. This multi-year program is ongoing and, as previously disclosed, may require significant capital expenditures and dedication of resources in both current and future periods, though management believes that the modified approach referenced above will ultimately result in a lower overall cost to the Company in delivering these capabilities. Contractual Cash Obligations and Commercial Commitments The following is a summary of the Company's contractual cash obligations at January 31, 2018 : (in millions) Total 2018 2019-2020 2021-2022 Thereafter Unrecorded contractual obligations: Operating leases a $ 1,685.7 $ 313.6 $ 458.9 $ 349.4 $ 563.8 Inventory purchase obligations b 268.4 268.4 Interest on debt c 629.2 35.9 71.8 70.7 450.8 Other contractual obligations d 86.6 58.1 17.8 4.1 6.6 Recorded contractual obligations: Short-term borrowings 120.6 120.6 Long-term debt e 891.9 50.0 841.9 2017 Tax Act - Transition Tax liability f 56.5 5.9 8.8 8.8 33.0 $ 3,738.9 $ 802.5 $ 557.3 $ 483.0 $ 1,896.1 a) Operating lease obligations do not include obligations for contingent rent, property taxes, insurance and maintenance that are required by most lease agreements. Contingent rent for the year ended January 31, 2018 totaled $32.7 million . See "Item 8. Financial Statements and Supplementary Data - Note J. Commitments and Contingencies" for a discussion of the Company's operating leases. b) The Company will, from time to time, enter into arrangements to purchase rough diamonds that contain minimum purchase obligations. Inventory purchase obligations associated with these agreements have been estimated at approximately $45.0 million for 2018 and are included in this table. Purchases beyond 2018 that are contingent upon mine production have been excluded as they cannot be reasonably estimated. c) Excludes interest payments on amounts outstanding under available lines of credit, as the outstanding amounts fluctuate based on the Company's working capital needs. TIFFANY & CO. K- 44 Table of Contents d) Consists primarily of technology licensing and service contracts, fixed royalty commitments, construction-in-progress and packaging supplies. e) Amounts exclude any unamortized discount or premium. f) Under the 2017 Tax Act, the Company recorded estimated income tax expense of $56.0 million in respect of the Transition Tax and a related income tax liability, which is payable over eight years, and of which $5.9 million is current and $50.6 million is non-current, as of January 31, 2018. See "Item 8. Financial Statements and Supplementary Data - Note O. Income Taxes" for additional information. The summary above does not include the following items: Cash contributions to the Company's pension plan and cash payments for other postretirement obligations. The Company funds its U.S. pension plan's trust in accordance with regulatory limits to provide for current service and for the unfunded benefit obligation over a reasonable period and for current service benefit accruals. To the extent that these requirements are fully covered by assets in the Qualified Plan, the Company may elect not to make any contribution in a particular year. No cash contribution was required in 2017, and none is required in 2018, to meet the minimum funding requirements of the Employee Retirement Income Security Act ("ERISA"). However, the Company periodically evaluates whether to make discretionary cash contributions to the Qualified Plan and made voluntary cash contributions of $15.0 million in 2017 and $120.0 million in 2016, but currently does not expect to make such contributions in 2018. This expectation is subject to change based on management's assessment of a variety of factors, including, but not limited to, asset performance, interest rates and changes in actuarial assumptions. The Company estimates cash payments for postretirement health-care and life insurance benefit obligations will not be significant in 2018 . Unrecognized tax benefits at January 31, 2018 of $10.1 million and accrued interest and penalties of $10.3 million . The final outcome of tax uncertainties is dependent upon various matters including tax examinations, interpretation of the applicable tax laws or expiration of statutes of limitations. The Company believes that its tax positions comply with applicable tax law and that it has adequately provided for these matters. However, the examinations may result in proposed assessments where the ultimate resolution may result in the Company owing additional taxes.

The aggregate amount of borrowings that the Company is currently authorized to have outstanding under the Commercial Paper Program and the Credit Facilities is $750.0 million. As of January 31, 2018 , there were no borrowings outstanding under the Commercial Paper Program. d) Maturities through 2019. In addition, the Company has other available letters of credit and financial guarantees of $81.2 million, of which $22.6 million was outstanding at January 31, 2018 . Of those available letters of credit and financial guarantees, $60.1 million expires within one year. TIFFANY & CO.

Management expects such seasonality to continue. Critical Accounting Estimates The Company's consolidated financial statements have been prepared in accordance with accounting principles generally accepted in the United States of America. These principles require management to make certain estimates and assumptions that affect amounts reported and disclosed in the financial statements and related notes. Actual results could differ from those estimates and the differences could be material. Periodically, the Company reviews all significant estimates and assumptions affecting the financial statements and records any necessary adjustments. The development and selection of critical accounting estimates and the related disclosures below have been reviewed with the Audit Committee of the Company's Board of Directors. The following critical accounting policies that rely on assumptions and estimates were used in the preparation of the Company's consolidated financial statements. Inventory. The Company writes down its inventory for discontinued and slow-moving products. This write-down is equal to the difference between the cost of inventory and its net realizable value, and is based on assumptions about future demand and market conditions. Net realizable value is the estimated selling prices in the ordinary course of business, less reasonably predictable costs of completion, disposal and transportation. The Company has not made any material changes in the accounting methodology used to establish its reserve for discontinued and slow-moving products during the past three years. At January 31, 2018 , a 10% change in the reserve for discontinued and slow-moving products would have resulted in a change of $7.5 million in inventory and cost of sales. Property, plant and equipment and intangibles assets and key money . The Company reviews its property, plant and equipment and intangibles assets and key money for impairment when management determines that the carrying value of such assets may not be recoverable due to events or changes in circumstances. Recoverability of these assets is evaluated by comparing the carrying value of the asset with estimated future undiscounted cash flows. If the comparisons indicate that the value of the asset is not recoverable, an impairment loss is calculated as the difference between the carrying value and the fair value of the asset and the loss is recognized during that period. In 2017 , the Company recorded aggregate impairment charges of $10.0 million related to property, plant and equipment. In 2016, the Company recorded an impairment charge of $25.4 million associated with software costs capitalized in connection with the development of a new finished goods inventory management and merchandising information system (see "Item 8. Financial Statements and Supplementary Data - Note B. Summary of Significant Accounting Policies and Note E. Property, Plant and Equipment" for additional information). The Company did not record any significant impairment charges in 2015 . Goodwill . The Company performs its annual impairment evaluation of goodwill during the fourth quarter of its fiscal year or when circumstances otherwise indicate an evaluation should be performed. A qualitative assessment is first performed for each reporting unit to determine whether it is more-likely-than-not that the fair value of the reporting unit is less than its carrying value. If it is concluded that this is the case, an evaluation, based upon discounted cash flows, is performed and requires management to estimate future cash flows, growth rates and economic and market conditions. The 2017 , 2016 and 2015 evaluations resulted in no impairment charges. Income taxes . The Company is subject to income taxes in U.S. federal and state, as well as foreign, jurisdictions. The calculation of the Company's tax liabilities involves dealing with uncertainties in the application of complex tax laws and regulations in a multitude of jurisdictions across the Company's global operations. Significant judgments and estimates are required in determining consolidated income tax expense. The Company's income tax expense, deferred tax assets and liabilities and reserves for uncertain tax positions reflect management's best assessment of estimated future taxes to be paid. Foreign and domestic tax authorities periodically audit the Company's income tax returns. These audits often examine and test the factual and legal basis for positions the Company has taken in its tax filings with respect to its tax liabilities, including the timing and amount of deductions and the allocation of income among various tax jurisdictions ("tax filing positions"). Management believes that its tax filing positions are reasonable and legally TIFFANY & CO. K- 46 Table of Contents supportable. However, in specific cases, various tax authorities may take a contrary position. In evaluating the exposures associated with the Company's various tax filing positions, management records reserves using a more-likely-than-not recognition threshold for income tax positions taken or expected to be taken. Earnings could be affected to the extent the Company prevails in matters for which reserves have been established or is required to pay amounts in excess of established reserves. At January 31, 2018 , total unrecognized tax benefits were $10.1 million of which approximately $1.1 million, if recognized, would affect the effective income tax rate. As of January 31, 2018 , unrecognized tax benefits are not expected to change materially in the next 12 months. Future developments may result in a change in this assessment. In evaluating the Company's ability to recover its deferred tax assets within the jurisdiction from which they arise, management considers all available evidence. The Company records valuation allowances when management determines it is more likely than not that deferred tax assets will not be realized in the future. Following the enactment of the 2017 Tax Act on December 22, 2017, the SEC issued SAB 118 to address the application of U.S. GAAP in situations when a registrant does not have the necessary information available, prepared, or analyzed (including computations) in reasonable detail to complete the accounting for certain income tax effects of the 2017 Tax Act. Specifically, SAB 118 provides a measurement period for companies to evaluate the impacts of the 2017 Tax Act on their financial statements. This measurement period begins in the reporting period that includes the enactment date and ends when an entity has obtained, prepared and analyzed the information that was needed in order to complete the accounting requirements, and cannot exceed one year. The Company has adopted the provisions of SAB 118 with respect to the impact of the 2017 Tax Act on its consolidated financial statements. Consistent with SAB 118, the Company calculated and recorded reasonable estimates for the impact of the Transition Tax and the remeasurement of its deferred tax assets and deferred tax liabilities, as set forth above. The Company also adopted the provisions of SAB 118 as it relates to the assertion of the indefinite reinvestment of foreign earnings and profits. The charges associated with the Transition Tax and the remeasurement of the Company's deferred tax assets and deferred tax liabilities, as a result of applying the 2017 Tax Act, represent provisional amounts for which the Company analysis is incomplete but a reasonable estimate could be determined and recorded during the fourth quarter of 2017. Further, the impact of the 2017 Tax Act on the Company's assertion to indefinitely reinvest foreign earnings is incomplete as the Company is analyzing the relevant provisions of the 2017 Tax Act and related accounting guidance. Therefore, a provisional estimate has not been recorded or disclosed as it relates to the potential tax consequences of an actual repatriation of unremitted foreign earnings. As the Company refines its provisional estimate calculations, further analyzes provisions of the 2017 Tax Act and any subsequent guidance related thereto, these provisional estimates could be affected, which could have a material impact on the Company's future financial results, including its fiscal 2018 results (see "Item 7. Management's Discussion and Analysis - 2018 Outlook"). Additionally, further regulatory or GAAP accounting guidance regarding the 2017 Tax Act could also materially affect the Company's future financial results. For additional information, see "Item 8. Financial Statements and Supplementary Data - Note O. Income Taxes". Employee benefit plans . The Company maintains several pension and retirement plans, as well as provides certain postretirement health-care and life insurance benefits for retired employees. The Company makes certain assumptions that affect the underlying estimates related to pension and other postretirement costs. Significant changes in interest rates, the market value of securities and projected health-care costs would require the Company to revise key assumptions and could result in a higher or lower charge to earnings. The Company used a discount rate of 4.25% to determine 2017 expense for its U.S. Qualified Plan, its postretirement plans and its Excess Plan/SRIP. Holding all other assumptions constant, a 0.5% increase in the discount rates would have decreased 2017 pension and postretirement expenses by $5.8 million and $0.5 million. A decrease of 0.5% in the discount rates would have increased the 2017 pension and postretirement expenses by $6.5 million and $0.3 million. The discount rate is subject to change each year, consistent with changes in the yield on applicable high-quality, long-term corporate bonds. Management selects a discount rate at which pension and postretirement benefits could be effectively settled based on (i) an analysis of expected benefit payments attributable to current employment service and (ii) appropriate yields related to such cash flows. TIFFANY & CO. K- 47 Table of Contents The Company used an expected long-term rate of return on pension plan assets of 7.00% to determine its 2017 pension expense. Holding all other assumptions constant, a 0.5% change in the long-term rate of return would have changed the 2017 pension expense by approximately $2.4 million. The expected long-term rate of return on pension plan assets is selected by taking into account the average rate of return expected on the funds invested or to be invested to provide for the benefits included in the projected benefit obligation. More specifically, consideration is given to the expected rates of return (including reinvestment asset return rates) based upon the plan's current asset mix, investment strategy and the historical performance of plan assets. For postretirement benefit measurement purposes, a 7.00% annual rate of increase in the per capita cost of covered health care was assumed for 2018 . The rate was assumed to decrease gradually to 4.75% by 2023 and remain at that level thereafter. A one-percentage-point change in the assumed health-care cost trend rate would not have a significant effect on the Company's accumulated postretirement benefit obligation for the year ended January 31, 2018 or aggregate service and interest cost components of the 2017 postretirement expense. 2018 Outlook For the fiscal year ending January 31, 2019 ("fiscal 2018"), management's guidance includes: (i) worldwide net sales increasing by a mid-single-digit percentage over the prior year both as reported and on a constant-exchange-rate basis; (ii) earnings before income taxes equal to or slightly below the prior year; (iii) net earnings increasing to a range of $4.25 $4.45 per diluted share and (iv) net earnings and EPS increasing in the first quarter with subsequent quarters' earnings over the balance of the year affected by the amount and timing of anticipated higher investment spending. These expectations are approximations and are based on the Company's plans and assumptions for the full year, including: (i) low-to-mid-single-digit comparable sales growth (which, beginning in 2018, will include Company-operated stores, e-commerce and catalog sales for the periods that are presented), with varying degrees of growth in all regions; (ii) worldwide gross retail square footage increasing 2%, net through nine store openings, two closings and at least 15 relocations; (iii) operating margin below the prior year as a result of SG&A expense growth (affected by higher investment spending in technology, marketing communications, visual merchandising, digital and store presentations) at a higher rate than sales growth, partly offset by a higher gross margin; (iv) interest and other expenses, net in line with the prior year; (v) an effective income tax rate in the high 20's; (vi) no meaningful effect in fiscal 2018 from the U.S. dollar versus foreign currencies on a year-over-year basis; and (vii) minimal benefit to net earnings per diluted share from share repurchases. Management also expects: (i) net cash provided by operating activities of $660 million and (ii) free cash flow (see "Non-GAAP Measures") of $380 million. These expectations are approximations and are based on the Company plans and assumptions for the full year, including: (i) net inventories increasing approximately in line with sales growth, (ii) capital expenditures of $280 million and (iii) net earnings in line with management's expectations, as described above.
