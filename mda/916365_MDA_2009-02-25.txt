Item 7 . Management Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations Overview Tractor Supply Company is the largest operator of retail farm and ranch stores in the United States and is focused on supplying the lifestyle needs of recreational farmers and ranchers and of those who enjoy the rural lifestyle, as well as tradesmen and small businesses. Our stores are located in towns outlying major metropolitan markets and in rural communities and offer the following comprehensive selection of merchandise: Equine, pet and animal products, including items necessary for their health, care, growth and containment; Maintenance products for agricultural and rural use; Hardware and tool products; Seasonal products, including lawn and garden power equipment; Truck and towing products; and Work/recreational clothing and footwear for the entire family. Our Tractor Supply stores typically range in size from 15,500 square feet to 18,500 square feet of inside selling space and additional outside selling space. We are developing stores using several standard prototypes as well as existing building structures. Our wholly-owned subsidiary, Del s, which operated 28 stores as of December 27, 2008 primarily in the Pacific Northwest, offers a wide selection of products (primarily in the equine, pet and animal category) tailored to those who enjoy the rural lifestyle. Del stores currently range in size from approximately 2,000 to 6,000 square feet of inside selling space plus additional outside and covered/sheltered selling space. Our current and long-term growth strategy is to (1) expand geographic market presence through opening new retail stores, (2) enhance financial performance through same-store sales increases, achieved through targeted merchandising programs with an everyday low prices philosophy and supported by strong customer service, (3) enhance product margin through assortment management, vendor management, sourcing and optimization of transportation and distribution costs, (4) leverage operating costs, especially occupancy, advertising and distribution, (5) expand market opportunities via internet sales, and (6) expand through selective acquisition, as such opportunities arise, to enhance penetration into new and existing markets as a complimentary strategy to organic growth. We have experienced considerable sales growth over the last five years, with a compounded annual growth rate of approximately 15.4%. We project an increase in our unit count of approximately 8 to 9% for 2009. We believe this unit count increase will contribute substantially to our future growth. The acquisition of Del enabled us to establish an initial presence in the Pacific Northwest, primarily in Washington, with three additional stores in Hawaii. We operated 855 retail farm and ranch stores in 44 states as of December 27, 2008 and have plans to open 70 to 80 stores in fiscal 2009. We have developed a proven method for selecting store sites and have identified over 575 potential additional markets for new Tractor Supply stores (excluding Del s) in the United States. We have slowed the growth of Del as we refine the concept, and we do not plan to open any additional Del stores in fiscal 2009. The net cash investment required to open a new leased retrofit store in fiscal 2008 was between $0.9 to $2.0 million and $0.9 to $1.3 million to open a new leased prototype store. The average net cash investment for new stores opened in 2008 was $1.2 million for retrofit stores and $1.0 million for prototype stores. A majority of the cash outlay was for initial acquisition of inventory and capital expenditures (principally leasehold improvements, fixtures and equipment), and approximately $107,000 for pre-opening costs. We have placed significant emphasis on our merchandising programs, evaluating the sales and profitability of our products through detailed line reviews, review of vendor performance measures and modification of the overall product offerings. We believe these efforts, coupled with a strong marketing program and in-depth product knowledge training of our store employees, have enhanced our sales and financial performance. 16 Table of Contents Seasonality and Weather Our business is highly seasonal. Historically, our sales and profits have been the highest in the second and fourth fiscal quarters of each year due to the sale of seasonal products. Unseasonable weather, excessive precipitation, drought, and early or late frosts may also affect our sales. We believe, however, that the impact of adverse weather conditions is somewhat mitigated by the geographic dispersion of our stores. We experience our highest inventory and accounts payable levels during our first fiscal quarter each year for purchases of seasonal product in anticipation of the spring selling season and again during our third fiscal quarter in anticipation of the winter selling season. Inflation Although we cannot determine the full effect of inflation on our operations, we believe our sales and results of operations are affected by inflation. We are subject to market risk with respect to the pricing of certain products and services, which include, among other items, steel, grain, petroleum, corn, soybean and other commodities as well as transportation services. Moreover, in the last few years, energy prices have risen dramatically, which has resulted in increased fuel costs for our business and utility costs for our stores. If the cost of these products and services continues to increase, consumer demand may fall and/or we may not be able to pass all such increases on to our customers and, as a result, sales and/or gross margins could decline. Our strategy is to reduce or mitigate the effects of inflation principally by taking advantage of vendor incentive programs, economies of scale from increased volume of purchases, increasing retail prices and selectively buying from the most competitive vendors without sacrificing quality. Due to the competitive environment, such conditions have and may continue to adversely impact our gross margin. Significant Accounting Policies and Estimates Management discussion and analysis of our financial position and results of operations are based upon our consolidated financial statements, which have been prepared in accordance with United States generally accepted accounting principles. The preparation of these financial statements requires management to make informed estimates and judgments that affect the reported amounts of assets, liabilities, revenues and expenses and related disclosure of contingent assets and liabilities. Our financial position and/or results of operations may be materially different when reported under different conditions or when using different assumptions in the application of such policies. In the event estimates or assumptions prove to be different from actual amounts, adjustments are made in subsequent periods to reflect more current information. Our significant accounting policies are disclosed in Note 1 to our Consolidated Financial Statements. The following discussion addresses our most critical accounting policies, which are those that are both important to the portrayal of our financial condition and results of operations and that require significant judgment or use of complex estimates. 17 Table of Contents Effect if Actual Results Differ From Description Judgments and Uncertainties Assumptions Revenue Recognition and Sales Returns: We recognize revenue at the time the customer takes possession of merchandise or receives services. If we receive payment before the customer has taken possession of the merchandise (as per our special order and layaway programs), the revenue is deferred until the sale is complete. Revenues from the sale of gift cards are deferred and recognized upon redemption. We estimate a liability for sales returns based on a one-year rolling average of historical return trends and we believe that our estimate for sales returns is an accurate reflection of future returns associated with past sales. Our estimation methodologies have been consistently applied from year to year, however, as with any estimates, refunds activity may vary from estimated amounts. We recognize a benefit for gift cards when: (i) the gift card or merchandise return card is redeemed by the customer; (ii) the likelihood of the gift card being redeemed by the customer is remote (referred to as breakage ); or (iii) the unredeemed merchandise returns cards expire (one year from issuance). The gift card breakage rate is based upon historical redemption patterns and a benefit is recognized for unredeemed gift cards in proportion to those historical redemption patterns. We have not made any material changes in the accounting methodology used to recognize sales returns in the financial periods presented. We do not believe there is a reasonable likelihood that there will be a material change in the future estimates or assumptions we use to calculate sales returns or gift card breakage. However, if actual consumer return or gift card redemption patterns are not consistent with our estimates or assumptions, we may be exposed to losses or gains that could be material. A 10% change in our sales return reserve at December 27, 2008, would have affected net earnings by approximately $195,000 in fiscal 2008. A 10% change in our assumptions regarding gift card breakage would have affected net earnings by approximately $315,000 in fiscal 2008. Inventory Valuation: Impairment Risk We identify potentially excess and slow-moving inventory by evaluating turn rates, historical and expected future sales trends, age of merchandise, overall inventory levels, current cost of inventory and other benchmarks. The estimated inventory valuation reserve to recognize any impairment in value (i.e., an inability to realize the full carrying value) is based on our aggregate assessment of these valuation indicators under prevailing market conditions and current merchandising strategies. We do not believe our merchandise inventories are subject to significant risk of obsolescence in the near term. However, changes in market conditions or consumer purchasing patterns could result in the need for additional reserves. Our impairment reserve contains uncertainties because the calculation requires management to make assumptions and to apply judgment regarding forecasted consumer demand, overall aging, the promotional environment, historical results and current inventory loss trends. We have not made any material changes in the accounting methodology used to recognize impairment reserves in the financial periods presented. We do not believe there is a reasonable likelihood that there will be a material change in the future estimates or assumptions we use to calculate impairment. However, if assumptions regarding consumer demand or clearance potential for certain products are inaccurate, we may be exposed to losses or gains that could be material. A 10% change in our impairment reserve at December 27, 2008, would have affected net earnings by approximately $465,000 in fiscal 2008. 18 Table of Contents Effect if Actual Results Differ From Description Judgments and Uncertainties Assumptions Shrinkage Our stores perform physical inventories at least once a year and we have established reserves for estimating inventory shrinkage between physical inventory counts. This is done by assessing the chain-wide average shrinkage experience rate, applied to the related periods sales volumes. Such assessments are updated on a regular basis for the most recent individual store experiences. The estimated shrink rate is based on historical experience. We believe historical rates are a reasonably accurate reflection of future trends. Our shrinkage reserve contains uncertainties because the calculation requires management to make assumptions and to apply judgment regarding historical trends, loss prevention measures and new merchandising strategies. We have not made any material changes in the methodology used to recognize shrinkage in the financial periods presented. We do not believe there is a reasonable likelihood that there will be a material change in the future estimates or assumptions we use to calculate our shrinkage reserve. However, if our estimates regarding inventory losses are inaccurate, we may be exposed to losses or gains that could be material. A 10% change in our shrinkage reserve at December 27, 2008, would have affected net earnings by approximately $878,000 in fiscal 2008. Vendor Support We receive funding from substantially all of our significant merchandise vendors for the promotion of our brand as well as the sale of their products through a variety of programs and arrangements, including guaranteed funding and volume rebate programs. The amounts received are subject to terms of vendor agreements, which have varying expiration dates ranging in duration from several months to several years. Many agreements are negotiated annually and are based on expected annual purchases of the vendor product. Vendor funding is initially deferred as a reduction of the purchase price of inventory and then recognized as a reduction of cost of merchandise as the related inventory is sold, which is in compliance with Emerging Issues Task Force No. 02-16, Accounting by a Customer (Including a Reseller) for Certain Consideration Received from a Vendor ( EITF 02-16 ). The amount of expected funding is estimated based upon initial guaranteed commitments, as well as anticipated purchase levels with applicable vendors. The estimated purchase volume and related vendor funding is based on our current knowledge of inventory levels, sales trends and expected customer demand, as well as planned new store openings and relocations. Although we believe we can reasonably estimate purchase volume and related vendor funding, it is possible that actual results could significantly differ from estimated amounts. Our allocation methodology contains uncertainties because the calculation requires management to make assumptions and to apply judgment regarding purchasing activity, target thresholds and vendor attrition. At the end of each fiscal year, the estimated support is reconciled to the actual amounts earned based upon actual purchase activity. We do not believe there is a significant collectibility risk related to vendor support amounts due us at the end of fiscal 2008. Although it is unlikely that there will be any significant reduction in historical levels of vendor support, if such a reduction were to occur, the Company could experience a higher inventory balance and higher cost of sales. If a 10% reserve had been applied against our outstanding vendor support due as of December 27, 2008, net earnings would have been affected by approximately $1.2 million. Freight We incur various types of transportation and delivery costs in connection with inventory purchases. Such costs are included as a component of the overall cost of inventories (on an aggregate basis) and recognized as a component of cost of merchandise sold as the related inventory is sold. We allocate freight as a component of total cost of sales without regard to inventory mix or unique freight burden of certain categories. This assumption has been consistently applied for all years presented. If a 10% increase or decrease had been applied against our current inventory capitalized freight balance, net earnings would have been affected by approximately $3.1 million. 19 Table of Contents Effect if Actual Results Differ From Description Judgments and Uncertainties Assumptions Share-Based Payments: We have a stock-based compensation plan, which includes incentive and non-qualified stock options, nonvested share awards, and an employee stock purchase plan. See Note 1, Significant Accounting Policies, and Note 2, Share-Based Compensation, to the Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements, included in Item 8, Financial Statements and Supplementary Data, of this Annual Report on Form 10-K, for a complete discussion of our stock-based compensation programs. We estimate the fair value of our stock option awards at the date of grant utilizing a Black-Scholes option pricing model. We estimate the fair value of our market-based nonvested share awards at the date of grant utilizing average market price of our stock on the date of the related award. Management reviews its assumptions and the valuations provided by independent third-party valuation advisors to determine the fair value of stock-based compensation awards. Option-pricing models and generally accepted valuation techniques require management to make subjective assumptions and to apply judgment to determine the fair value of our awards. These assumptions and judgments include estimating the future volatility of our stock price, expected dividend yield, future employee turnover rates and future employee stock option exercise behaviors. In addition to the key assumptions used to estimate the fair value, the estimated forfeiture rate of the awarded options is a critical assumption, as it reduces expense ratably over the vesting period. Changes in these assumptions can materially affect the fair value estimate. While we update our assumptions annually, we do not believe there is a reasonable likelihood that there will be a material change in the future estimates or assumptions we use to determine stock-based compensation expense. However, if actual results are not consistent with our estimates or assumptions, we may be exposed to changes in stock-based compensation expense that could be material. The reported stock-based compensation expense may not be representative of the actual economic cost of the stock-based compensation. A 10% change in our stock-based compensation expense for the year ended December 27, 2008, would have affected net earnings by approximately $753,000. Self-Insurance Reserves: We self-insure a significant portion of our employee medical insurance, workers compensation and general liability insurance plans. We have stop-loss insurance policies to protect from individual losses over specified dollar values ($200,000 for employee health insurance claims, $350,000 for workers compensation and $250,000 for general liability). When estimating our self-insured liabilities, we consider a number of factors, including historical claims experience, demographic factors, severity factors and valuations provided by independent third-party actuaries. Management reviews its assumptions and the valuations provided by independent third-party actuaries to determine the adequacy of our self-insured liabilities. The full extent of certain claims, especially workers compensation and general liability claims, may not become fully determined for several years. Our self-insured liabilities contain uncertainties because management is required to make assumptions and to apply judgment to estimate the ultimate cost to settle reported claims and claims incurred but not reported as of the balance sheet date. We have not made any material changes in the accounting methodology used to establish our self-insurance reserves in the financial periods presented. We do not believe there is a reasonable likelihood that there will be a material change in the assumptions we use to calculate insurance reserves. However, if we experience a significant increase in the number of claims or the cost associated with these claims, we may be exposed to losses or gains that could be material. A 10% change in our self-insurance reserves at December 27, 2008, would have affected net earnings by approximately $1.4 million in fiscal 2008. 20 Table of Contents Effect if Actual Results Differ From Description Judgments and Uncertainties Assumptions Sales Tax Audit Reserve: A portion of our sales are to tax-exempt customers. We obtain exemption information as a necessary part of each tax-exempt transaction. Many of the states in which we conduct business will perform audits to verify our compliance with applicable sales tax laws. The business activities of our customers and the intended use of the unique products sold by us create a challenging and complex environment of compliance. These circumstances also create some risk that we could be challenged as to the propriety of our sales tax compliance. While we believe we reasonably enforce sales tax compliance with our customers and endeavor to fully comply with all applicable sales tax regulations, there can be no assurance that we, upon final completion of such audits, would not have a significant liability for disallowed exemptions. We review our past audit experience and assessments with applicable states to determine if we have potential exposure for non-compliance. Any estimated liability is based on an initial assessment of compliance risk and our to-date experience with each audit. As each audit progresses, we quantify the exposure based on preliminary assessments made by the state auditors, adjusted for additional documentation that may be provided to reduce the assessment. Our sales tax audit reserve contains uncertainties because management is required to make assumptions and to apply judgment regarding the regulatory support for SKU-specific agricultural-based exemptions, ambiguity in state tax regulations, and the level of exemptions support required by applicable states. We have not made any material changes in the methodology used to establish the sales tax audit reserve in the financial periods presented. We do not believe there is a reasonable likelihood that there will be a material change in the future estimates or assumptions we use to calculate the sales tax liability reserve for current audits. However, if our estimates regarding the ultimate sales tax liability are inaccurate, we may be exposed to losses or gains that could be material. A 10% change in our sales tax liability reserve at December 27, 2008, would have affected net earnings by approximately $144,000 in fiscal 2008. Tax Contingencies: Our income tax returns are periodically audited by U.S. federal and state tax authorities. These audits include questions regarding our tax filing positions, including the timing and amount of deductions and the allocation of income among various tax jurisdictions. At any one time, multiple tax years are subject to audit by the various tax authorities. In evaluating the exposures associated with our various tax filing positions, we record reserves for probable exposures. A number of years may elapse before a particular matter, for which we have established a reserve, is audited and fully resolved or clarified. We adjust our tax contingencies reserve and income tax provision in the period in which actual results of a settlement with tax authorities differs from our established reserve, the statute of limitations expires for the relevant tax authority to examine the tax position or when more information becomes available. Effective December 31, 2006, we adopted Financial Accounting Standards Board ( FASB ) Interpretation No. 48, Accounting for Uncertainty in Income Taxes, an Interpretation of FASB Statement No. 109 ( FIN 48 ) . Accordingly, we recognize a liability for certain tax benefits that do not meet the minimum requirements for recognition in the financial statements. See Note 9, Income Taxes, to Consolidated Financial Statements, included in Item 8, Financial Statements and Supplementary Data, of this Annual Report on Form 10-K for a complete discussion on our unrecognized tax benefit reserve. Our tax contingencies reserve contains uncertainties because management is required to make assumptions and to apply judgment to estimate the exposures associated with our various filing positions and whether or not the minimum requirements for recognition of tax benefits have been met. Our effective income tax rate is also affected by changes in tax law, the tax jurisdiction of new stores or business ventures, the level of earnings and the results of tax audits. We do not believe there is a reasonable likelihood that there will be a material change in the reserves established for tax benefits not recognized. Although management believes that the judgments and estimates discussed herein are reasonable, actual results could differ, and we may be exposed to losses or gains that could be material. To the extent we prevail in matters for which reserves have been established, or are required to pay amounts in excess of our reserves, our effective income tax rate in a given financial statement period could be materially affected. An unfavorable tax settlement would require use of our cash and would result in an increase in our effective income tax rate in the period of resolution. A favorable tax settlement would be recognized as a reduction in our effective income tax rate in the period of resolution. A 10% change in our unrecognized tax benefit reserve at December 27, 2008 would have affected net earnings by approximately $187,000 in fiscal 2008. 21 Table of Contents Effect if Actual Results Differ From Description Judgments and Uncertainties Assumptions Goodwill: Goodwill and intangible assets with indefinite lives are not amortized. We evaluate goodwill for impairment annually and whenever events or changes in circumstances indicate the carrying value of the goodwill may not be recoverable. We complete our impairment evaluation by performing internal valuation analyses, considering other publicly available market information and using an independent valuation firm, as appropriate. All goodwill at December 27, 2008 and December 29, 2007 is associated with the Del business and for purposes of impairment testing, Del is considered the reporting unit. The test for goodwill impairment is a two step process. The first step of the goodwill impairment test, used to identify the potential for impairment, compares the fair value of a reporting unit with the carrying value of its net assets, including goodwill. If the fair value of the reporting unit is less than the carrying value of the reporting unit, the second step of the goodwill impairment test is performed to measure the amount of impairment loss to be recorded, if any. The second step, if required, would compare the implied fair value of goodwill with the current carrying amount of goodwill. If the implied fair value of goodwill is less than the carrying value, an impairment charge would be recorded as a charge to our operations. In the fourth quarter of fiscal 2008, we completed our annual impairment testing of goodwill using the methodology described herein, and determined there was no impairment. We performed the first step of the goodwill impairment analysis with the assistance of a third party valuation specialist and determined that the fair value of the Del reporting unit (including goodwill) was in excess of the carrying value of the reporting unit and as such, the second step was not necessary. In reaching this conclusion, the fair value of the Del reporting unit was determined based on a weighting of income and market approaches. Under the income approach, the fair value of the Del reporting unit is calculated as the present value of estimated future cash flows. Under the market approach, the fair value is based on observed market multiples for comparable businesses and guideline transactions. We determine fair value using widely accepted valuation techniques, including discounted cash flow and market multiple analyses. These types of analyses contain uncertainties because they require management to make assumptions and to apply judgment to estimate industry economic factors and the profitability of future business strategies. Estimates include revenues, gross margins, operating costs and cash flows. We considered historical and estimated future results, economic and market conditions and the impact of planned business and operational strategies in deriving these estimates. We have not made any material changes in our impairment loss assessment methodology in the financial periods presented. In developing the key judgments and assumptions used to assess impairment, we consider economic, operational and market conditions that could impact the fair value of the Del reporting unit. These estimates and the judgments and assumptions upon which the estimates are based may differ in some respects from actual results. Should a significant or prolonged deterioration in economic conditions persist, then key judgments and assumptions may be impacted. Thus, if actual results are not consistent with our current estimates or assumptions, we may be exposed to an impairment charge that could be material. 22 Table of Contents Effect if Actual Results Differ From Description Judgments and Uncertainties Assumptions Long-Lived Assets: Long-lived assets other than goodwill and indefinite-lived intangible assets, which are separately tested for impairment, are evaluated for impairment whenever events or changes in circumstances indicate that the carrying value may not be recoverable. When evaluating long-lived assets for potential impairment, we first compare the carrying value of the asset to the asset estimated future cash flows (undiscounted and without interest charges). If the estimated future cash flows are less than the carrying value of the asset, we calculate an impairment loss. The impairment loss calculation compares the carrying value of the asset to the asset estimated fair value, which may be based on an estimated future cash flow model. We recognize an impairment loss if the amount of the asset carrying value exceeds the asset estimated fair value. If we recognize an impairment loss, the adjusted carrying amount of the asset becomes its new cost basis. For a depreciable long-lived asset, the new cost basis will be depreciated (amortized) over the remaining useful life of that asset. Our impairment loss calculations contain uncertainties because they require management to make assumptions and to apply judgment to estimate future cash flows and asset fair values, including forecasting useful lives of the assets and selecting the discount rate that reflects the risk inherent in future cash flows. We have not made any material changes in our impairment loss assessment methodology in the financial periods presented. We do not believe there is a reasonable likelihood that there will be a material change in the estimates or assumptions we use to calculate long-lived asset impairment losses. However, if actual results are not consistent with our estimates and assumptions used in estimating future cash flows and asset fair values, we may be exposed to losses that could be material. 23 Table of Contents Quarterly Financial Data Our unaudited quarterly operating results for each fiscal quarter of 2008 and 2007 are shown below (dollars in thousands, except per share amounts): First Second Third Fourth Quarter Quarter Quarter Quarter Total 2008 Net sales $ 576,208 $ 898,327 $ 733,918 $ 799,496 $ 3,007,949 Gross margin 175,516 273,509 218,196 245,040 912,261 Income (loss) from operations (2,041 ) 71,158 26,077 40,375 135,569 Net income (loss) (2,004 ) 43,352 15,870 24,712 81,930 Net income (loss) per share: (1) Basic $ (0.05 ) $ 1.17 $ 0.44 $ 0.68 $ 2.22 Diluted $ (0.05 ) $ 1.15 $ 0.43 $ 0.67 $ 2.19 Same-store sales increase (decrease) (6.5 )% 3.4 % 6.2 % 1.3 % 1.4 % 2007 Net sales $ 559,832 $ 790,929 $ 629,199 $ 723,252 $ 2,703,212 Gross margin 168,180 250,424 198,647 235,457 852,708 Income from operations 8,980 71,108 29,669 50,284 160,041 Net income 4,999 43,757 17,468 30,017 96,241 Net income per share: (1) Basic $ 0.12 $ 1.10 $ 0.45 $ 0.79 $ 2.45 Diluted $ 0.12 $ 1.08 $ 0.44 $ 0.77 $ 2.40 Same-store sales increase 8.5 % 1.0 % 1.9 % 3.8 % 3.4 % (1) Due to the nature of interim earnings per share calculations, the sum of quarterly earnings per share amounts may not equal the reported earnings per share for the year. 24 Table of Contents Results of Operations Our fiscal year includes 52 or 53 weeks and ends on the last Saturday of the calendar year. References to fiscal year mean the year in which that fiscal year ended. The fiscal years ended December 27, 2008, December 29, 2007 and December 30, 2006 contain 52 weeks. The following table sets forth, for the periods indicated, certain items in our Consolidated Statements of Income expressed as a percentage of net sales. 2008 2007 2006 Net sales 100.0 % 100.0 % 100.0 % Cost of merchandise sold 69.7 68.5 68.5 Gross margin 30.3 31.5 31.5 Selling, general and administrative expenses 23.8 23.7 23.5 Depreciation and amortization 2.0 1.9 1.8 Income from operations 4.5 5.9 6.2 Interest expense, net 0.1 0.2 0.1 Income before income taxes 4.4 5.7 6.1 Income tax provision 1.7 2.1 2.3 Net income 2.7 % 3.6 % 3.8 % Fiscal 2008 Compared to Fiscal 2007 Net sales increased 11.3% to $3,007.9 million in fiscal 2008 from $2,703.2 million in fiscal 2007. This increase resulted from the opening of new stores as well as a same-store sales improvement of 1.4%. Our average transaction value increased 2.2% to $44.55 and same-store transaction value increased 1.3% for fiscal 2008. The same-store average daily transaction count increased 0.1%. The average daily transaction count for the Company decreased 3.8% to 230. The decrease is a result of the new stores opened during the year which have lower transaction volumes until their sales ramp to chain average. Same-store sales improvements of 1.4% compared to 3.4% in the prior year were strongest in core consumable categories including animal and pet-related products, clothing and footwear. In fiscal 2008, we opened 91 new stores (compared to 89 new stores in fiscal 2007), relocated one store (compared to 12 in fiscal 2007) and closed no stores (compared to selling our only Del store located in Canada in fiscal 2007). Gross margin increased 7.0% to $912.3 million compared to $852.7 million in 2007. As a percent of sales, gross margin decreased to 30.3% for fiscal 2008 compared to 31.5% for fiscal 2007. The decrease in gross margin resulted primarily from a substantial increase in the LIFO provision. The LIFO provision increased 123 basis points from the prior year due to significant inflation (increases in costs for certain commodities, petroleum-based products and steel), a shift in the product mix towards higher turning, higher inflationary items and clearance activity. As a percent of sales, selling, general and administrative ( SG&A ) expenses increased 10 basis points to 23.8% in fiscal 2008 from 23.7% in fiscal 2007. This increase was due largely to occupancy and payroll expenses relating to new stores, which generally have higher costs in relation to sales volume than the chain average, offset by an aggressive expense management program. Depreciation and amortization expense increased 18.9% in fiscal 2008 over fiscal 2007 due mainly to costs associated with new stores. Net interest expense decreased 10 basis points as a percent of sales to $2.1 million in fiscal 2008 from $5.0 million in fiscal 2007. This decrease is directly related to a lower average debt balance primarily due to a reduction in stock repurchase activity in 2008, as compared to 2007. Our effective tax rate increased to 38.6% for fiscal 2008 compared to 37.9% in fiscal 2007, resulting primarily from increases in state tax rates. As a result of the foregoing factors, net income for fiscal 2008 decreased 14.9% to $81.9 million, or $2.19 per diluted share, as compared to net income of $96.2 million, or $2.40 per diluted share, in fiscal 2007. During 2008, we repurchased approximately 1.6 million shares of stock for $53.9 million as part of our previously announced $400 million share repurchase program. In 2007, we repurchased approximately 3.2 million shares at a total cost of $150.0 million. 25 Table of Contents Fiscal 2007 Compared to Fiscal 2006 Net sales increased 14.1% to $2,703.2 million in fiscal 2007 from $2,369.6 million in fiscal 2006. This increase resulted from the opening of new stores as well as a same-store sales improvement of 3.4%. Our average transaction value increased 1.1% to $43.60 while same-store transaction value decreased 0.1% for fiscal 2007. Average daily transaction count per store increased 0.6% to 239, and same-store transaction count increased 3.5%. Same-store sales improvements of 3.4% compared to 1.6% in the prior year were strongest in the livestock/pet and truck/towing categories, but were partially offset by lower than expected performance in seasonal and hardware/tool products. In fiscal 2007, we opened 89 new stores (compared to 82 new stores in fiscal 2006), relocated 12 stores (compared to 15 in fiscal 2006) and sold our only Del store located in Canada (compared to one closed store in fiscal 2006). As a percent of sales, gross margin was unchanged at 31.5% compared with the prior year. Reductions in direct product costs were achieved through improved sourcing and mix of sales, but were offset by slightly higher transportation costs and increased shrinkage. As a percent of sales, SG&A expenses increased 20 basis points to 23.7% in fiscal 2007 from 23.5% in fiscal 2006. The increase is primarily attributable to increased occupancy and payroll costs from new stores, which generally have higher costs in relation to sales volume than the chain average. Depreciation and amortization expense increased 20.7% in fiscal 2007 over fiscal 2006 due mainly to costs associated with new stores. Net interest expense increased 10 basis points as a percent of sales to $5.0 million in fiscal 2007 from $2.7 million in fiscal 2006. This increase is due largely to borrowings related to the stock repurchase program. Our effective tax rate increased to 37.9% for fiscal 2007 compared to 37.4% in fiscal 2006, resulting primarily from state taxes relating to the composition of income among the states and the adoption of FIN 48 relating to uncertainties in income tax positions. This interpretation prescribes the minimum recognition threshold a tax position is required to meet before being recognized in the financial statements. Tax positions that meet a more-likely-than-not recognition threshold should be measured in order to determine the tax benefit to be recognized. We are no longer subject to federal examination for years before 2005, and state and local income tax examinations for years before 2002. We adopted the provisions of FIN 48 in fiscal 2007, as required. As a result, we charged approximately $1.9 million to retained earnings for the cumulative effect of adoption including interest. Interest and penalties were immaterial at the date of adoption. The total amount of unrecognized tax benefits that, if recognized, would affect the effective tax rate is $2.3 million. In addition, we recognize current interest accrued related to these uncertain tax positions as interest expense. As a result of the foregoing factors, net income for fiscal 2007 increased 5.8% to $96.2 million, or $2.40 per diluted share, compared to net income of $91.0 million, or $2.22 per diluted share, in fiscal 2006. During 2007, the Company repurchased 3.2 million shares of its stock for $150.0 million as part of our previously announced $400 million (as amended in August 2008) share repurchase program. Liquidity and Capital Resources In addition to normal operating expenses, our primary ongoing cash requirements are for expansion, remodeling and relocation programs, including inventory purchases and capital expenditures. Our primary ongoing sources of liquidity are funds provided from operations, commitments available under our revolving credit agreement, capital and operating leases and normal trade credit. Our inventory and accounts payable levels typically build in the first and third fiscal quarters in anticipation of the spring and winter selling seasons, respectively. 26 Table of Contents Working Capital At December 27, 2008, we had working capital of $283.5 million, a $28.6 million decrease from December 29, 2007. This decrease was primarily attributable to changes in the following components of current assets and current liabilities (in millions): 2008 2007 Variance Current assets: Cash and cash equivalents $ 37.2 $ 13.7 $ 23.5 Inventories 603.4 636.0 (32.6 ) Prepaid expenses and other current assets 42.0 41.9 0.1 Deferred income taxes 1.7 0.3 1.4 684.3 691.9 (7.6 ) Current liabilities: Accounts payable $ 286.8 $ 258.3 $ 28.5 Accrued expenses 113.5 115.6 (2.1 ) Income taxes payable 5.1 (5.1 ) Current portion of capital lease obligation 0.5 0.8 (0.3 ) 400.8 379.8 21.0 Working capital $ 283.5 $ 312.1 $ (28.6 ) The decrease in inventories resulted primarily from a decrease in average inventory per store due to planned inventory management initiatives to reduce inventory levels coupled with more aggressive clearance efforts. The accounts payable increase is due to improved vendor financing. Trade credit arises from our vendors granting extended payment terms for inventory purchases. Payment terms generally vary from 30 days to 180 days depending on the inventory product. We experienced an increase in our financed inventory from approximately 38.3% in 2007 to 43.0% in 2008. (The calculated financed inventory assumes average inventory, excludes in-transit inventories and includes only unopened stores with significant inventory). Borrowings and Credit Facilities On February 22, 2007 we entered into a new Senior Credit Facility with Bank of America, N.A, as agent for a lender group (the Credit Agreement ), allowing us to borrow up to $250 million (with sublimits of $75 million and $10 million for letters of credit and swingline loans, respectively). The Credit Agreement is unsecured and has a five year term, with proceeds expected to be used for working capital, capital expenditures and share repurchases. In February 2008, we exercised the increase option on our Credit Agreement increasing the overall capacity from $250 million to $350 million. Each of the nine lenders within our Credit Agreement bank group participated in the increase. Simultaneously, definitions within the Credit Agreement were modified as follows: (1) added an additional Increase Option for $150 million (subject to additional lender group commitments); (2) modified the definition of swingline committed amount from $10 million to $20 million; and (3) revised the definition of the fixed charge coverage ratio covenant to remove certain defined fixed charges. All pricing terms and the term of the facility remained the same. At December 27, 2008, there were no outstanding borrowings under the Credit Agreement and there were $55.0 million in borrowings outstanding at December 29, 2007. There were an additional $25.1 million and $25.0 million outstanding letters of credit as of December 27, 2008 and December 29, 2007, respectively. Borrowings bear interest at either the bank base rate (3.25% at December 27, 2008) or the London Inter-Bank Offer Rate ( LIBOR ) (0.46% at December 27, 2008) plus an additional amount ranging from 0.35% to 0.90% per annum, adjusted quarterly based on our performance (0.50% at December 27, 2008). We are also required to pay, quarterly in arrears, a commitment fee ranging from 0.06% to 0.18% per annum and adjusted quarterly based on our performance, for unused capacity (0.10% at December 27, 2008). There are no compensating balance requirements associated with the Credit Agreement. The Credit Agreement contains certain restrictions regarding additional indebtedness, capital expenditures, business operations, guarantees, investments, mergers, consolidations and sales of assets, transactions with subsidiaries or affiliates, and liens. The Credit Agreement requires quarterly compliance with respect to fixed charge coverage and leverage ratios. We were in compliance with all covenants at December 27, 2008. 27 Table of Contents Sources and Uses of Cash Our primary source of liquidity is cash provided by operations. Principal uses of cash for investing activities are capital expenditures and financing activities are payments on debt and repurchase of the Company common stock. The following table presents a summary of cash flows from operating, investing and financing activities for the last three fiscal years (in millions): 2008 2007 2006 Net cash provided by operating activities $ 217.4 $ 155.0 $ 87.5 Net cash used in investing activities (88.4 ) (82.6 ) (80.8 ) Net cash provided by (used in) financing activities (105.5 ) (85.1 ) 10.1 Net increase (decrease) in cash and cash equivalents $ 23.5 $ (12.7 ) $ 16.8 Operating Activities The $62.4 million increase in net cash provided by operations in fiscal 2008 over fiscal 2007 is primarily due to changes in the following operating activities (in millions): 2008 2007 Variance Net income $ 81.9 $ 96.2 $ (14.3 ) Depreciation and amortization 60.7 51.1 9.6 Stock compensation expense 12.3 10.6 1.7 Deferred income taxes 1.6 7.0 (5.4 ) Inventories and accounts payable 61.0 (11.9 ) 72.9 Accrued expenses (2.1 ) 4.3 (6.4 ) Income taxes currently payable (5.9 ) (6.5 ) 0.6 Other, net 7.9 4.2 3.7 Net cash provided by operations $ 217.4 $ 155.0 $ 62.4 The improvement in net cash provided by operations in fiscal 2008 compared with fiscal 2007 was primarily due to changes in inventory levels and the timing of payments. Inventory levels decreased in 2008 compared to 2007, due to an increased focus on inventory management in 2008. Additionally, we achieved an increase in financed inventory to 43.0% in 2008 from 38.3% in 2007, resulting in an increase in accounts payable while decreasing inventory. The $67.5 million increase in net cash provided by operations in fiscal 2007 over fiscal 2006 is primarily due to changes in the following operating activities (in millions): 2007 2006 Variance Net income $ 96.2 $ 91.0 $ 5.2 Depreciation and amortization 51.1 42.3 8.8 Stock compensation expense 10.6 9.7 0.9 Deferred income taxes 7.0 (3.5 ) 10.5 Inventories and accounts payable (11.9 ) (78.7 ) 66.8 Accrued expenses 4.3 8.8 (4.5 ) Income taxes currently payable (6.5 ) 10.1 (16.6 ) Other, net 4.2 7.8 (3.6 ) Net cash provided by operations $ 155.0 $ 87.5 $ 67.5 The improvement in net cash provided by operations in fiscal 2007 compared with fiscal 2006 was primarily due to changes in inventory levels and the timing of payments. Inventory levels increased less in 2007 compared to 2006, due to the timing of imports and a focus on inventory management in 2007. Additionally, we achieved a slight increase in financed inventory, resulting in a higher increase in accounts payable relative to inventory. The change in cash used for income taxes relates to the timing of quarterly payments caused by annualized proration requirements. 28 Table of Contents Investing Activities Investing activities used $88.4 million, $82.6 million and $80.8 million in fiscal 2008, 2007 and 2006, respectively. The majority of this cash requirement relates to our capital expenditures. Our significant store expansion, coupled with required investment in infrastructure, resulted in the following capital expenditures, including capital leases (in millions): 2008 2007 2006 New and relocated stores and stores not yet opened $ 39.8 $ 38.1 $ 54.1 Existing store properties acquired from lessor 8.5 6.8 Existing stores 10.0 18.3 20.2 Distribution center capacity and improvements 16.2 3.3 2.3 Information technology 17.2 17.4 13.4 Corporate and other 0.1 0.1 0.6 $ 91.8 $ 84.0 $ 90.6 Our long-term growth strategy anticipates continued geographic market expansion and further concentration within existing markets. This growth will also require continuing investment in information technology and people. The costs reflected above are typically building improvements, as we lease the majority of our facilities. We currently estimate that capital expenditures will range between $95 million and $100 million in fiscal 2009. While we plan to open fewer stores in 2009, we expect to replace those investments with store refurbishment, an upgrade in IT hardware, and other efficiency-driving system enhancements in 2009. Financing Activities Financing activities used $105.5 million, used $85.1 million, and provided $10.1 million in fiscal 2008, 2007 and 2006, respectively. The cash used by financing activities in fiscal 2008 is mainly the result of share repurchase activity and net repayments under the Senior Credit Facility. We have a Board-approved share repurchase program which provides for repurchase of up to $400 million of common stock, exclusive of any fees, commissions, or other expenses related to such repurchases, through December 2011. In August 2008, the board of directors authorized a $200 million increase to the existing $200 million share repurchase program and extended the program term from February 2010 to December 2011. The repurchases may be made from time to time on the open market or in privately negotiated transactions. The timing and amount of any shares repurchased under the program will depend on a variety of factors, including price, corporate and regulatory requirements, capital availability, and other market conditions. Repurchased shares will be held in treasury. The program may be limited or terminated at any time without prior notice. As of December 27, 2008, we had remaining authorization under the share repurchase program of $196.2 million exclusive of any fees, commissions, or other expenses. We repurchased approximately 1.6 million and 3.2 million shares at a total cost of $53.9 million and $150.0 million in fiscal 2008 and 2007, respectively. Repurchased shares are accounted for at cost and will be held in treasury for future issuance. We believe that our cash flow from operations, borrowings available under the Credit Agreement, and normal trade credit will be sufficient to fund our operations and our capital expenditure needs, including store openings, relocations and renovations, over the next several years. Significant Contractual Obligations and Commercial Commitments The following table reflects our future obligations and commitments as of December 27, 2008 (in thousands): Payment Due by Period Total Contractual Less than More than Obligations 1 year 1-3 years 4-5 years 5 years Operating leases $ 1,359,527 $ 145,109 $ 276,147 $ 250,833 $ 687,438 Capital leases (1) 3,956 720 726 292 2,218 Purchase obligations (2) 2,552 2,552 $ 1,366,035 $ 148,381 $ 276,873 $ 251,125 $ 689,656 (1) Capital lease obligations include related interest. (2) The amounts for purchase obligations include commitments for construction of stores expected to be opened in fiscal 2009. The Company had outstanding standby letters of credit of $25.1 million as of December 27, 2008. 29 Table of Contents Off-Balance Sheet Arrangements Our off-balance sheet arrangements consist of operating leases and outstanding letters of credit. The balances for these arrangements are discussed above. We typically lease buildings for retail stores and offices rather than acquiring these assets which allows us to utilize financial capital to operate the business rather than invest in fixed assets. Letters of credit allow us to purchase inventory, primarily sourced overseas, and support certain risk management programs in a timely manner. Recent Accounting Pronouncements Fair Value Measurements In September 2006, the FASB issued SFAS No. 157, Fair Value Measurements , ( SFAS 157 ). SFAS 157 defines fair value, establishes a framework for measuring fair value in accordance with accounting principles generally accepted in the United States, and expands disclosures about fair value measurements. In February 2008, the FASB issued FASB Staff Position No. FAS 157-2, Effective Date of FASB Statement No. 157 ( FSP 157-2 ), which amended SFAS 157 and delayed its effective date for all nonfinancial assets and nonfinancial liabilities, except those that are recognized or disclosed at fair value in the financial statements on a recurring basis (that is, at least annually). FSP 157-2 defers the effective date of SFAS 157 to fiscal years beginning after November 15, 2008, and interim periods within those fiscal years for items within the scope of FSP 157-2. The adoption of SFAS 157 and FSP 157-2 did not impact our financial condition, results of operations, or cash flow. In October 2008, the FASB issued FASB Staff Position No. FAS 157-3, Determining the Fair Value of a Financial Asset When the Market for That Asset Is Not Active. This FSP clarifies the application of Statement No. 157 in an inactive market. The FASB also issued a joint press release with the Office of the Chief Accountant of the SEC on September 30, 2008 that addresses similar guidance to what is contained in FSP FAS 157-3. The guidance in these two releases clarifies that observable transactions in inactive markets may not be indicative of fair value, and in such instances, the use of a reporting entity own assumptions about future cash flows and appropriately risk-adjusted discount rates may provide a better estimate of an asset fair value. The application of this guidance did not have an impact on our financial condition, results of operations or cash flows. The Fair Value Option for Financial Assets and Financial Liabilities In February 2007, the FASB issued SFAS No. 159, The Fair Value Option for Financial Assets and Financial Liabilities ( SFAS 159 ). SFAS 159 allows entities the option to measure eligible financial instruments at fair value as of specified dates. Such election, which may be applied on an instrument by instrument basis, is typically irrevocable once elected. We adopted SFAS 159 effective December 30, 2007 (fiscal 2008). The adoption of SFAS 159 did not impact our financial condition, results of operations, or cash flow. Business Combinations In December 2007, the FASB issued SFAS No. 141 (revised 2007), Business Combinations ( SFAS 141R ), which replaces SFAS No. 141, Business Combinations ( SFAS 141 ) issued in 2001 . Whereas its predecessor applied only to business combinations in which control was obtained by transferring consideration, the revised standard applies to all transactions or other events in which one entity obtains control over another. SFAS 141R defines the acquirer as the entity that obtains control over one or more other businesses and defines the acquisition date as the date the acquirer achieves control. SFAS 141R requires the acquirer to recognize assets acquired, liabilities assumed and any noncontrolling interest in the acquiree at their respective fair values as of the acquisition date. The revised standard changes the treatment of acquisition-related costs, restructuring costs related to an acquisition that the acquirer expects but is not obligated to incur, contingent consideration associated with the purchase price and preacquisition contingencies associated with acquired assets and liabilities. SFAS 141R retains the guidance in SFAS 141 for identifying and recognizing intangible assets apart from goodwill. The revised standard applies prospectively to business combinations for which the acquisition date is on or after the beginning of the first annual reporting period beginning on or after December 15, 2008. Thus we will be required to apply the provisions of SFAS 141R to any business acquisition which occurs on or after December 28, 2008, but this standard will have no effect on prior acquisitions. 30 Table of Contents Determination of the Useful Life of Intangible Assets In April 2008, the FASB issued FSP No. FAS 142-3, Determination of the Useful Life of Intangible Assets , which amends the factors that must be considered in developing renewal or extension assumptions used to determine the useful life over which to amortize the cost of a recognized intangible asset under SFAS 142, Goodwill and Other Intangible Assets. The FSP requires an entity to consider its own assumptions about renewal or extension of the term of the arrangement, consistent with its expected use of the asset, and is an attempt to improve consistency between the useful life of a recognized intangible asset under SFAS 142 and the period of expected cash flows used to measure the fair value of the asset under SFAS 141, Business Combinations. The FSP is effective for fiscal years beginning after December 15, 2008, and the guidance for determining the useful life of a recognized intangible asset must be applied prospectively to intangible assets acquired after the effective date. The FSP is not expected to have a significant impact on our financial condition, results of operations or cash flow. The Hierarchy of Generally Accepted Accounting Principles In May 2008, the FASB issued SFAS No. 162, The Hierarchy of Generally Accepted Accounting Principles ( SFAS 162 ). The statement is intended to improve financial reporting by identifying a consistent hierarchy for selecting accounting principles to be used in preparing financial statements that are prepared in conformance with generally accepted accounting principles. SFAS 162 was effective November 15, 2008 and did not have any impact on our financial condition, results of operations or cash flow. I tem 7A. Quantitative and Qualitative Disclosures About Market Risk We are exposed to changes in interest rates primarily from the Credit Agreement. The Credit Agreement bears interest at either the bank base rate (3.25% and 7.25% at December 27, 2008 and December 29, 2007, respectively) or LIBOR (0.46% and 4.86% at December 27, 2008 and December 29, 2007, respectively) plus an additional amount ranging from 0.35% to 0.90% per annum, adjusted quarterly, based on our performance (0.50% at both December 27, 2008 and December 29, 2007). We are also required to pay (quarterly in arrears) a commitment fee ranging from 0.06% to 0.18% based on the daily average unused portion of the credit line (0.10% at both December 27, 2008 and December 29, 2007). A hypothetical 100 basis point adverse move (increase) in interest rates along the entire interest rate yield curve would result in approximately $535,000 of additional annual interest expense and would not impact the fair market value of the long-term debt. 31 Table of Contents
