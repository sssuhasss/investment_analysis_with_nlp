ITEM 7. MANAGEMENT S DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS OF FINANCIAL CONDITION AND RESULTS OF OPERATIONS (For an overview of our business groups, including a discussion of products and services provided, see the Business discussion contained in Part I, Item 1, of this Annual Report on Form 10-K.) MANAGEMENT OVERVIEW General Dynamics offers a broad portfolio of products and services in business aviation; combat vehicles, weapons systems and munitions; shipbuilding design and construction; and information systems, technologies and services. We operate through four business groups Aerospace, Combat Systems, Marine Systems and Information Systems and Technology. Our primary customers are the U.S. military, other U.S. government organizations, the armed forces of other nations, and a diverse base of corporate, government and individual buyers of business aircraft. We operate in two primary markets: defense and business aviation. The majority of our revenues derive from contracts with the U.S. military. The nation engagement in the global war on terror, coupled with the need to modernize U.S. military forces, has driven steady Department of Defense funding increases since 2001. In particular, procurement and research and development (R&D) budgets, also known as investment accounts, provide the majority of our revenues. Defense Department total, or top-line, funding has increased at a compound annual growth rate of 6.9 percent from fiscal 2001 through 2009, while procurement and R&D spending has grown nearly 7.3 percent annually during that period. For fiscal year 2009, the Congress appropriated $516 billion for the Department of Defense, including approximately $182 billion for procurement and R&D. Budget expenditures generally lag congressional funding, and we expect that expenditures applied toward programs over the next few years will be consistent with defense funding appropriated in recent years. Our future growth potential in the U.S. defense market is driven by the size of the defense budget, the allocation of that budget to investment accounts, the diversity of our exposure to different programs and customers within the budget, and our successful execution of the contracts we are awarded. During this period of war, defense budgets have included the President budget submission, as well as supplemental funds requested over the course of the fiscal year to meet the emergent needs of the warfighter. For fiscal year 2008, the Congress appropriated $183 billion in emergency spending, including approximately $68 billion, or 37 percent, for investment accounts. For fiscal year 2009, the Congress has appropriated $66 billion in supplemental funding, primarily for battlefield operational requirements. The Defense Department has indicated that it will request at least another $70 billion of supplemental funding in 2009 to include funds for procuring additional weaponry. If this second supplemental is approved, defense funding for fiscal year 2009 will total approximately $652 billion, a 110 percent increase since 2001. Looking ahead, we expect defense core budget top-line growth to moderate. In the near-term, top-line funding should remain at or near current well-funded levels, led by the need to continue to support ongoing war operations. While the landscape will continue to evolve in conjunction with the new administration defense strategy as well as dynamic macroeconomic and geopolitical conditions, we expect near-term defense funding levels to be driven primarily by the following: continued support for the warfighter from the administration and the Congress in the face of threats posed by an uncertain global security environment; the number of troops deployed in Afghanistan and Iraq, coupled with the increase in the overall size of the U.S. military; the need to reset and replenish equipment and supplies damaged and consumed during the war; the need to maintain thousands of jobs that support the health of our nation military infrastructure; and the need to modernize that infrastructure to address the evolving requirements of modern-day warfare. Future supplemental funding levels will likely decrease in tandem with the administration current plan to reduce troop levels in Iraq, offset somewhat by an increased footprint in Afghanistan. As this supplemental spending decreases, some of the supplemental funding that had previously been used to finance core procurement programs will likely shift back to the base budget. Beyond our U.S. defense market, governments around the world continue to fund weapons and equipment modernization programs, leading to significant defense export opportunities. We are committed to pursuing international opportunities presented by international demand for military hardware and information technologies. While the revenue upside can be significant, European and other international defense budgets are subject to unpredictable issues of contract award timing, defense priorities and overall fiscal spending pressures. As we broaden the customer base for our defense products around the world, we expect growing international sales. The business-aviation market remained strong for much of 2008. While mid-size order activity moderated from past years, Gulfstream enjoyed continued strong order activity for its long-range and ultra-long-range business-jet offerings, including its new G650 product. Market conditions changed significantly, however, in the fourth quarter of 2008 as credit and financial markets seized in reaction to deteriorating global economic conditions. This severe dislocation caused new aircraft order activity to slow. This sudden financial turmoil affected some of Gulfstream customers who either sought deferral or defaulted on their aircraft orders. General Dynamics 2008 Annual Report 19 Table of Contents These perturbations in the group backlog had no impact to financial performance in 2008 due largely to the willingness of customers in the backlog to move up to earlier availabilities. If the market continues to erode, additional defaults and deferrals may occur. However, we believe the diversity and duration of the business-jet order book positions the Aerospace group to bridge the current market turmoil. Aircraft-service revenues, which grew 8 percent in 2008, provide the group diversified exposure to after-market sales fueled by recent growth in the global installed business-jet fleet. We believe continued investment in new aircraft products will drive long-term growth, particularly when the Aerospace group begins delivering its newest aircraft offerings, the G250 in 2011 and the G650 in 2012. We are committed to creating shareholder value through ethical business practices, disciplined program management and continuous operational improvements. Our solid performance is measured in our sustained revenue and earnings growth and strong cash flow. General Dynamics record as an industry leader in cash flow generation has provided our management the flexibility to execute our operational strategy, and enabled us to consistently deploy resources to further enhance shareholder returns through strategic and tactical acquisitions, payment of dividends and share repurchases. CONSOLIDATED OVERVIEW The following discussion of our results of operations is based on operating performance at the business group level. The disclosures focus on the material financial measures our management uses to evaluate the performance of each of our four business groups, including sales, operating earnings and margins, cash flow, and orders and backlog. For the defense business groups, the discussion of results of operations is based on specific contracts and programs that drive the group results rather than types of products and services, which often comprise multiple contracts with different customers. For the Aerospace group, the results are analyzed with respect to specific lines of products and services, consistent with how the group is managed. In the defense business groups, the majority of the sales are generated by long-term government contracts. As discussed further in the Application of Critical Accounting Policies section, we account for sales under these contracts using the percentage-of-completion method of accounting. Under this method, revenue is recognized as work progresses, either as products are produced and delivered or as services are rendered, as applicable. As a result, changes in sales are generally discussed in terms of volume. Volume indicates increases or decreases in sales due to changes in production or construction activity levels, changes in delivery schedules or levels of services on individual contracts. In the Aerospace group, we recognize revenue using the percentage-of-completion method. Sales contracts for new aircraft have two major phases: the manufacture of the green aircraft and the aircraft completion, which includes exterior painting and installation of customer-selected interiors and optional avionics. We record revenues on these contracts at two milestones: when green aircraft are delivered to and accepted by the customer, and when the customer accepts final delivery of the aircraft. Revenues in the Aerospace group Jet Aviation aircraft outfitting business are recognized as work progresses, similar to our defense businesses. Aircraft services revenues are recognized upon delivery of services. Changes in sales in this group result from the number of new aircraft deliveries (both green and completion), the progress toward completion of aircraft outfitting activities, the level of service activity during the period and the number of pre-owned aircraft sold. Operating earnings and margins in the defense business groups are generally discussed in terms of changes in sales volume, performance, or the mix of contracts (e.g., fixed-price/cost-reimbursable) and the phases of work within those contracts (e.g., development/production). Performance refers to changes in contract earnings rates during the term of the contract based on revisions to estimates of profit at completion on individual contracts. These revisions result from increases or decreases to the estimated value of the contract and/or the estimated costs required to complete the contract. The following discussion of results provides additional disclosure to the extent that a material or unusual event causes a change in the profitability of a contract. Operating earnings and margins in the Aerospace group are generally a function of the prices we are able to charge for our various aircraft models, the operational efficiency of the group in the manufacture and completion of the aircraft, and the mix of aircraft deliveries among the higher-margin large-cabin and lower-margin mid-size aircraft. Additional factors affecting the group earnings and margins include the volume and profitability of services work performed, the number and type of pre-owned aircraft sold, and the level of general and administrative costs incurred by the group, which include selling expenses and research and development costs. 20 General Dynamics 2008 Annual Report Table of Contents Results of Operations Year Ended December 31 2008 2007 Variance Net sales $ 29,300 $ 27,240 $ 2,060 7.6 % Operating earnings 3,653 3,113 540 17.3 % Operating margin 12.5 % 11.4 % In 2008, we achieved solid growth in sales and a significant increase in operating earnings compared with 2007. This strong performance during the year resulted in our highest operating margin in eight years backed by continued strong cash flows from operations. We received a record level of orders in 2008, ending the year with the highest backlog in our history. Each of our four business groups produced increases in sales in 2008 over the prior year. Sales growth in the Aerospace and Marine Systems groups was particularly strong in 2008 as a result of continued increases in business-jet aircraft deliveries and increased activity on U.S. Navy and commercial shipbuilding programs. In the Combat Systems group, strong demand for U.S. military vehicles and related support services drove the increase in sales. Higher activity in tactical and strategic mission systems contributed the majority of the sales growth in the Information Systems and Technology group. Our operating earnings increased at more than double the rate of sales growth in 2008, and three of our four business groups reported earnings in excess of $1 billion. Growth in operating earnings exceeded the sales growth in all of our business groups due to strong program execution and a continued focus on operating performance. Overall, our operating margins increased 110 basis points to 12.5 percent in 2008, the fifth consecutive year of margin expansion. Year Ended December 31 2007 2006 Variance Net sales $ 27,240 $ 24,063 $ 3,177 13.2 % Operating earnings 3,113 2,625 488 18.6 % Operating margin 11.4 % 10.9 % We produced significant sales growth in 2007 on the strength of rising sales in each of our business groups. In particular, the Combat Systems and Aerospace groups generated substantial sales growth in 2007 on U.S. military vehicle sales and increased business-jet deliveries. Sales in the Information Systems and Technology group increased primarily as a result of the acquisition of Anteon International Corporation in mid-2006. Sales were up slightly in the Marine Systems group compared with 2006. Our operating earnings grew at a higher rate than sales in 2007, as three of our four business groups achieved significant operating leverage. The Aerospace group earnings and margins reflected the strength of improved pricing and ongoing productivity improvements. Operating earnings and margins were up in Combat Systems and Marine Systems due to improved operational execution across a variety of programs. Our overall operating margins improved 50 basis points in 2007 to 11.4 percent. Cash Flow Cash flows from operations in 2008 exceeded net earnings for the tenth consecutive year. Net cash provided by operating activities was $3.1 billion in 2008, $2.9 billion in 2007 and $2.1 billion in 2006. In addition, we generated over $300 in cash in 2006 from the sale of several non-core businesses. Over the three-year period, we used our cash to fund acquisitions and capital expenditures, repurchase our common stock, pay dividends and repay maturing debt. Our net debt debt less cash and equivalents and marketable securities was $2.3 billion at the end of 2008 compared with a net surplus of $268 at the end of 2007. Our net debt increased by $2.5 billion during the year after $3.2 billion spent on acquisitions, over $1.5 billion of share repurchases, $533 of dividends paid, $490 of capital expenditures and more than $470 of company-sponsored research and development during the year. Other Financial Information General and administrative (G&A) expenses as a percentage of sales declined to 5.9 percent in 2008 from 6 percent in 2007 and 6.2 percent in 2006, reflecting our continued emphasis on operating leverage. G&A was $1.7 billion in 2008, $1.6 billion in 2007 and $1.5 billion in 2006. We expect 2009 G&A as a percent of sales to approximate the 2008 rate. Net interest expense was $66 in 2008 compared with $70 in 2007 and $101 in 2006. Interest income generated by our strong cash position has increased during each of the past three years while scheduled repayments of our long-term debt have steadily reduced interest expense. We expect net interest expense to increase to approximately $140 to $150 in 2009 due to the issuance of additional debt in 2008. Our effective tax rate was 31.2 percent in 2008, 31.7 percent in 2007 and 32.3 percent in 2006. In 2008, our taxes were reduced by a refund associated with the settlement of outstanding litigation. This resulted in a $35, or approximately $0.09 per-share, benefit that reduced our 2008 tax rate by 100 basis points. Our effective tax rate in 2007 was impacted favorably by the resolution of our 2003 to 2004 federal income tax audit with the Internal Revenue Service. This settlement resulted in a benefit of $18, or approximately $0.04 per share, which reduced our effective tax rate by 60 basis points. We anticipate an effective tax rate of approximately 31.5 to 32 percent in 2009. For additional discussion of tax matters, see Note E to the Consolidated Financial Statements. Discontinued Operations In 2008, we entered into an agreement to sell our Spanish nitrocellulose operation and recognized a pretax loss of $11 in discontinued operations. We expect the sale to close in the first quarter of 2009. In 2007, we completed the sale of our coal mining operation and received proceeds of approximately $25. We had previously recognized a pretax loss of $57 in discontinued operations in 2006 in anticipation of the sale. General Dynamics 2008 Annual Report 21 Table of Contents In 2006, we completed the sale of our aggregates operation. We received approximately $315 in cash from the sale of this business and recognized a pretax gain of $199 in discontinued operations. Our reported net sales exclude the revenues associated with these divested businesses. We have included their operating results, along with the gains and losses from the transactions discussed above, as discontinued operations, net of income taxes. For additional discussion of our divestiture activities and the results of discontinued operations, see Note C to the Consolidated Financial Statements. Backlog and Estimated Potential Contact Value Our total backlog increased almost 60 percent in 2008 to $74.1 billion at the end of the year. Funded backlog was $51.7 billion at year end, up 39 percent over 2007. We received $57 billion of new orders in 2008, the highest level in our history. Order activity was significant across each of our business groups, resulting in backlog growth in each group in 2008. The total backlog for our defense businesses increased 49 percent in 2008 to $51.6 billion, compared with $34.6 billion at the end of 2007. The defense backlog represents the estimated remaining sales value of work to be performed under firm contracts. The funded portion of this backlog was $29.9 billion at the end of 2008, up 17 percent over 2007. This includes items that have been authorized and appropriated by the Congress and funded by the customer, as well as commitments by international customers that are similarly approved and funded by their governments. The unfunded backlog for the defense businesses represents firm orders that do not meet these criteria. While there is no guarantee that future budgets and appropriations will provide funding for a given program, we have included in the backlog only firm contracts we believe are likely to receive funding. The Aerospace group total backlog reached a record level of $22.5 billion at year-end 2008 compared with $12.3 billion at the end of 2007, an increase of more than 83 percent. The group funded backlog increased almost 90 percent during the year to $21.9 billion at the end of 2008. The funded backlog represents orders for which we have definitive purchase contracts and deposits from the customer. The Aerospace unfunded backlog of $618 at the end of 2008 consists of agreements to provide future aircraft maintenance and support services. Our backlog does not include work awarded under unfunded indefinite delivery, indefinite quantity (IDIQ) contracts, unexercised options associated with existing firm contracts or options to purchase new aircraft, which we refer to collectively as estimated potential contract value. IDIQ contracts are used when the customer has not defined the exact timing and quantity of deliveries that will be required at the time the contract is executed. These agreements, which set forth the majority of the contractual terms, including prices, are funded as delivery orders are placed. A significant portion of our IDIQ value represents contracts for which we have been designated as the sole-source supplier to design, develop, produce and integrate complex products and systems over several years for the military or other government agencies. Management believes the customers intend to fully implement these systems. The estimated potential contract value also includes our estimate of the value we will receive under multiple-award IDIQ contracts in which we are one of several companies competing for task orders under the contract. Because the value of these arrangements is subject to the customer future exercise of an indeterminate quantity of delivery orders, we recognize these contracts in backlog only when they are funded. Contract options in our defense businesses represent agreements to perform additional work beyond the products and services associated with firm contracts, if the customer exercises the option. These options are negotiated in conjunction with a firm contract and provide the terms under which the customer may elect to procure additional units or services at a future date. Contract options in the Aerospace group represent options to purchase new aircraft, including long-term option agreements with fleet customers. We recognize options in backlog when the customer exercises the option and establishes a firm order. As of December 31, 2008, the estimated potential value associated with these IDIQ contracts and contract options was approximately $16.8 billion, up from $14.5 billion at the end of 2007. We expect to realize this value over the next 10 to 15 years. This represents management estimate of the potential value we will receive. The actual amount of funding received in the future may be higher or lower. REVIEW OF OPERATING SEGMENTS AEROSPACE Results of Operations and Outlook Year Ended December 31 2008 2007 Variance Net sales $ 5,512 $ 4,828 $ 684 14.2 % Operating earnings 1,021 810 211 26.0 % Operating margin 18.5 % 16.8 % Aircraft deliveries (in units): Green 156 138 18 13.0 % Completion 152 138 14 10.1 % 22 General Dynamics 2008 Annual Report Table of Contents The Aerospace group generated significant sales growth in 2008, attributable primarily to increased aircraft deliveries compared with 2007. The group increased aircraft production rates for the fifth consecutive year in 2008 in response to a steadily growing aircraft backlog. As a result, new aircraft sales increased 12 percent in 2008. Sequential years of higher new aircraft deliveries have expanded the group worldwide installed base of business-jet aircraft. As a result, demand in the group aircraft services business grew in 2008, with volume up 8 percent compared to 2007. Our November 2008 acquisition of Jet Aviation, a business-jet outfitting and aviation-services company, also contributed to the group sales growth. Approximately one-quarter of the group increase in sales in 2008 came from the addition of Jet Aviation. Pre-owned aircraft sales were $18 in 2008, down from $78 in 2007. The group had four pre-owned aircraft available for sale on December 31, 2008. The Aerospace group operating earnings increased at a significantly higher rate than sales in 2008. The following factors impacted the group growth in operating earnings during the year: Increased aircraft deliveries $ 146 Pricing, delivery mix and productivity improvements 105 Increased aircraft services 11 Pre-owned aircraft activity (25 ) General and administrative expenses (26 ) Total increase in operating earnings $ 211 Operating earnings and margins on the group 2008 aircraft deliveries were up compared with the units delivered in 2007, the result of improved pricing on aircraft orders over the past several years. The group also continued to generate productivity improvements in the aircraft assembly and outfitting processes, which further improved earnings in 2008. In late 2008, the number of pre-owned aircraft transactions was significantly curtailed in response to the deterioration of the global economic environment. As a result, the group wrote down the carrying value of the four pre-owned aircraft available for sale at year end. The group earnings growth was also tempered by increased selling expenses from strong order activity and higher product-development costs associated with the introduction of two new aircraft models in 2008. The net effect of these factors was a 170 basis-point increase in operating margins in 2008, following two years of 120 basis-point improvement. The significant deterioration in the economic environment in late 2008 weakened the global demand for business jets, particularly in the mid-size aircraft segment. As a consequence of these conditions and the relatively short duration of the group mid-size backlog, we plan to significantly reduce mid-size aircraft production in 2009. Given the substantial level and duration of the large-cabin aircraft backlog, we expect to increase production of these models in 2009. However, we assess aircraft production requirements quarterly and will modify the group production and delivery schedule as necessary based on the state of our backlog and market conditions. We also expect more pre-owned activity in 2009 than we experienced in 2008 or 2007. Of the contracts for 2009 aircraft deliveries, approximately 10 include aircraft trade-in options, which the customers may elect to exercise. Including the effect of a full year of results of Jet Aviation, we expect the Aerospace group 2009 sales to increase between 20 and 25 percent over 2008. We expect the group operating margins to be 200 to 220 basis points lower than those achieved in 2008 due primarily to the increase in aircraft-services volume associated with the Jet Aviation acquisition. Year Ended December 31 2007 2006 Variance Net sales $ 4,828 $ 4,116 $ 712 17.3 % Operating earnings 810 644 166 25.8 % Operating margin 16.8 % 15.6 % Aircraft deliveries (in units): Green 138 113 25 22.1 % Completion 138 104 34 32.7 % The Aerospace group sales and operating earnings increased significantly in 2007 over 2006. To meet growing global demand, the group increased aircraft production in 2007 resulting in new-aircraft sales growth of 22 percent compared with the prior year. Aircraft-services volume also increased 20 percent over 2006. Sales of pre-owned aircraft decreased to $78 in 2007 from $217 in 2006 as favorable market conditions led more customers to sell their own aircraft rather than trade them in. Operating earnings in 2007 increased approximately $205 as a result of the higher new-aircraft and aircraft-services volume. The earnings growth was also driven by improved pricing on units delivered in 2007 compared with 2006 as well as labor efficiencies and productivity improvements, particularly in the aircraft-completion process. These factors contributed a $65 increase in earnings in 2007. Higher selling and G&A costs and product-development spending reduced the group earnings growth by approximately $90, and lower sales of pre-owned aircraft reduced the earnings growth by $14. Backlog and Estimated Potential Contract Value General Dynamics 2008 Annual Report 23 Table of Contents The Aerospace group backlog increased 83 percent in 2008 to $22.5 billion at year end, the largest backlog in the group history. The group funded backlog was $21.9 billion at year end, up 89 percent over 2007. In 2008, the group received $15.4 billion in new orders, a record level for the fifth consecutive year and an increase of 67 percent over 2007. In addition, the acquisition of Jet Aviation in the fourth quarter added approximately $750 to the group backlog related to agreements to perform outfitting work for other equipment manufacturers. In the second quarter of 2008, the group began taking orders for the Gulfstream G650, a new ultra-long-range, ultra-large-cabin business jet that is scheduled to enter service in 2012. In the fourth quarter, the group introduced and began taking orders for the Gulfstream G250, a new super-mid-size business jet that is scheduled to enter service in 2011. The group experienced strong demand in North America as well as a growing proportion of international orders in 2008. Over 50 percent of the group orders in 2008 were from customers outside North America for the second year in a row. The group backlog includes scheduled aircraft deliveries for large-cabin models through periods ranging from 2011 to 2017. The backlog does not include options to purchase new aircraft, including long-term agreements with fleet customers. These options totaled $2.3 billion at the end of 2008 and are included in estimated potential contract value. As a result of the sharp decline in global economic conditions in 2008, the group had some customers default on their contracts late in the fourth quarter. These defaults had no impact on the group 2008 deliveries. We were able to fill those production slots with other customers who were interested in moving forward in the delivery queue. Despite the defaults, the backlog grew in 2008 as the group achieved a book-to-bill ratio (aircraft orders divided by deliveries) greater than one for the fifth consecutive year. While the backlog continues to have some risk, particularly if the economic climate worsens, we will continue to work with customers to minimize the future impact to the group performance. * Represents ratio of new aircraft orders to deliveries (in units) during the year.

COMBAT SYSTEMS Results of Operations and Outlook Year Ended December 31 2008 2007 Variance Net sales $ 8,194 $ 7,797 $ 397 5.1 % Operating earnings 1,111 916 195 21.3 % Operating margin 13.6 % 11.7 % The Combat Systems group net sales increased in 2008 compared with 2007. The group sales growth was driven by its U.S. military vehicle business: U.S. military vehicles $ 655 Weapons systems and munitions (140 ) European military vehicles (118 ) Total increase in sales $ 397 The increase in U.S. military vehicle sales was driven primarily by higher activity on the group mine-resistant, ambush-protected (MRAP) vehicle program and several contracts in support of the group Abrams main battle tank modernization efforts. Under the MRAP program, which emerged in late 2007, the group produces RG-31 and Cougar armored vehicles for the U.S. Department of Defense. The group is scheduled to complete deliveries of its remaining RG-31 MRAP vehicles under contract in the first quarter of 2009. Under the Abrams program, volume was up most notably in 2008 on the System Enhancement Package (SEP) upgrade and on contracts to repair and reset battle-damaged M1 tanks. Sales in the group weapons systems business decreased in 2008 due to fewer deliveries of systems that help protect U.S. combat forces from improvised explosive devices (IEDs). Sales increased slightly on the group munitions programs over 2007, particularly on its large- and medium-caliber munitions supply contracts for the United States and Canada. 24 General Dynamics 2008 Annual Report Table of Contents In the group European military vehicles business, volume was lower during the year on several international military vehicle programs including the Leopard tank program with the Spanish government. The decrease in sales in 2008 on these programs was offset slightly by increased volume on the group Piranha wheeled armored vehicle contract for Belgium and higher activity within the group mobile bridge business. In December 2007, the group received a notice of termination from the Czech Republic regarding its contract to deliver 199 Pandur II military vehicles. In the second quarter of 2008, we entered into a memorandum of understanding and a testing agreement with the Czech Republic regarding the testing and acceptance of 17 vehicles that had been completed by the group. We are negotiating a revised contract for the purchase of 107 vehicles, including the 17 completed vehicles. We do not believe the outcome of the negotiations will have a material effect on the group operating results. Due to ongoing negotiations, there were no sales recognized under this contract in 2008, but we expect to continue production upon finalization of the revised contract. The Combat Systems group operating earnings grew significantly in 2008, increasing at more than four times the rate of sales growth during the year. While the most significant driver of the group earnings growth was improved performance in the U.S. military vehicle business, particularly on the MRAP and Abrams programs, each of the group businesses generated at least a 100 basis-point increase in margins in 2008. The operating leverage achieved across Combat Systems operations in 2008 produced an overall 190 basis-point improvement in the group operating margins compared with 2007. On December 19, 2008, we acquired AxleTech International (AxleTech) of Troy, Michigan. AxleTech is a global manufacturer and supplier of highly engineered axles, suspensions, brakes and aftermarket parts for heavy-payload vehicles for a variety of military and commercial customers. We expect Combat Systems to produce sales growth of approximately 20 to 25 percent in 2009, including the addition of AxleTech revenues. We expect the group operating margins to return to a more sustainable mid-12 percent level in 2009. Year Ended December 31 2007 2006 Variance Net sales $ 7,797 $ 5,983 $ 1,814 30.3 % Operating earnings 916 677 239 35.3 % Operating margin 11.7 % 11.3 % In 2007, Combat Systems generated the greatest growth in sales and operating earnings among our four business groups. Each of the group businesses experienced double-digit sales and earnings growth over 2006. More than half of the growth resulted from increased volume in the group U.S. military vehicle business, including higher activity on Abrams-related contracts and the Stryker wheeled combat vehicle program, the ramp-up of production of light armored vehicles (LAVs) for the U.S. Marine Corps, and increased production of MRAP military vehicles. Sales increased almost 50 percent in the group munitions business in 2007 due to strong volume in its large- and medium-caliber munitions supply contracts and the acquisition of SNC Technologies Inc. in January 2007. In the group weapons systems business, sales grew 13 percent in 2007 due primarily to increased activity on its counter-IED contract. The European military vehicle business experienced sales growth of almost 30 percent in 2007. This growth resulted primarily from increased activity on Pandur and Piranha wheeled vehicle contracts for several European governments. The group operating margins increased 40 basis points in 2007 compared with 2006 due to a shift in contract mix and improved performance across a number of the group wheeled military vehicle programs. The margin growth was limited somewhat by the inclusion of lower-margin acquisitions in the munitions business, increased supplier costs on the group small-caliber munitions contract and costs recognized in connection with our exit from the group European commercial trading business. Backlog and Estimated Potential Contract Value The Combat Systems group total backlog was $15 billion at the end of 2008, an increase of 16 percent over 2007. Funded backlog grew 12 percent in 2008 to $12.1 billion at year end. The group backlog consists primarily of long-term production contracts that have scheduled deliveries through 2014. The group backlog on December 31, 2008, included approximately $3.8 billion for M1 Abrams main battle tank modernization and upgrade programs. These include the M1A2 SEP, Abrams Integrated Management (AIM) and Tank Urban Survivability Kit (TUSK) programs. Under the SEP program, we retrofit M1A2 Abrams main battle tanks with improved electronics, command-and-control capabilities and armor enhancements that are designed to improve the tank effectiveness. Over 50 percent of the group Abrams backlog at year end was for the SEP program. During 2008, the group was awarded a multi-year contract with a potential value of $1.2 billion from the U.S. Army to upgrade 435 M1A1 Abrams vehicles to the SEP Version Two (V2) configuration and received funding of $830 for 317 of those vehicles. Under the AIM program, M1 Abrams General Dynamics 2008 Annual Report 25 Table of Contents main battle tanks are completely overhauled and returned to a like-new condition. TUSK is a technological upgrade that improves the effectiveness of the tank in urban warfare environments. In 2008, the group received awards from the Army totaling $320 for the AIM and TUSK programs combined. At year end, the Abrams backlog included approximately $530 for these contracts. Additionally, the group received combined orders from the Army worth approximately $290 for Abrams systems technical support in 2008. The Combat Systems group backlog at year end included approximately $1.8 billion for the Army Stryker wheeled combat vehicle program, including the production of nearly 800 vehicles scheduled for delivery through 2011. In 2008, the group received orders valued at $2.1 billion from the Army under the Stryker program, including awards worth approximately $900 for the production of 677 Stryker vehicles and over $260 for Stryker modification kits to be used in Operation Iraqi Freedom. The group also received awards in 2008 totaling $600 for Stryker contractor logistics and field support, including reset and battle-damage repair. The group backlog for the Army Future Combat Systems (FCS) program totaled $1.2 billion at the end of 2008. The group leads the system development of the manned ground vehicles (MGV) element of the program, as well as the development of the autonomous navigation systems for FCS unmanned ground vehicles. The group current contract extends through 2013. Approximately $880 was included in the Combat Systems group backlog at the end of the year for the Marine Corps Expeditionary Fighting Vehicle (EFV) program. The group is building seven new prototypes under the system design and development phase of the EFV program and received orders of approximately $980 related to this effort in 2008. The group backlog at year end included approximately $700 under the MRAP program. The group produces two separate vehicles under this program the Cougar, in connection with its joint venture partner, and the RG-31. In 2008, the group received MRAP orders valued at nearly $1.1 billion for production of 778 RG-31 and 184 Cougar vehicles and related vehicle support and spare parts. Deliveries under the Cougar program were completed in 2008. The group deliveries of the RG-31 vehicles remaining under this contract are scheduled to be completed in the first quarter of 2009. The Combat Systems group has several significant international military vehicle production contracts in backlog. The backlog at the end of the year included: $560 for the production of 190 Pizarro Advanced Infantry Fighting Vehicles scheduled for delivery to the Spanish army through 2014. $360 for the production of 85 Leopard 2E battle tanks, which the group produces for the Spanish army using a design licensed from a German company. Deliveries are scheduled through 2010. $340 for the Pandur II vehicle contract with the Czech Republic that is currently being renegotiated. The backlog amount represents the estimated value of a revised contract for the purchase of 107 vehicles. $275 for a contract with the government of Belgium for 116 Piranha wheeled military vehicles. $230 from the Swiss government to provide 232 Duro wheeled armored personnel vehicles and 12 Piranha wheeled military vehicles. $165 for a contract with the government of Portugal for 226 Pandur II wheeled vehicles. $120 for a contract with the German government to provide 192 Eagle IV wheeled military vehicles. The Combat Systems group backlog at year end also included approximately $2.5 billion in weapons systems, munitions, detection systems and composite-structures programs. In 2008, the group received awards totaling $250 for the production of Hydra-70 rockets, bringing the total contract value to date to nearly $800. The group also received awards of approximately $125 from the Army in 2008 for the production of small-caliber ammunition, bringing the total contract value to date to almost $700. MARINE SYSTEMS Results of Operations and Outlook Year Ended December 31 2008 2007 Variance Net sales $ 5,556 $ 4,993 $ 563 11.3 % Operating earnings 521 421 100 23.8 % Operating margin 9.4 % 8.4 % Net sales in the Marine Systems group improved in 2008 as a result of increased activity across each of the group shipyards. The growth in the group sales consisted of the following: Mature Navy ship production $ 270 Commercial ship production 184 Navy design and early-stage production 154 Other (45 ) Total increase in sales $ 563 Approximately 60 percent of the Marine Systems group sales in both 2008 and 2007 were produced by three mature ship-production programs for the U.S. Navy the Virginia-class submarine, the T-AKE combat-logistics ship and the Arleigh Burke-class (DDG-51) destroyer. Activity increased on the Virginia program in 2008 as the group continued construction on its cost-reimbursable Block I contract and its fixed-price Block II contract. The final Block I ship and the first Block II ship were delivered in 2008, and construction is in process on the remaining five Block II ships. The group received a multi-year, eight-ship Block III award in the fourth quarter of 2008, and as a result, the group expects 26 General Dynamics 2008 Annual Report Table of Contents to increase production to two ships per year beginning in 2011. Including Block III, deliveries are scheduled through 2018. On the T-AKE program, volume increased in 2008 as the group delivered the fifth and sixth ships and continued construction of the seventh through tenth ships of the group 14-ship program. Deliveries are scheduled through 2012. Activity on the Arleigh Burke destroyer program decreased slightly in 2008 compared with 2007. The group delivered two destroyers in 2008, and construction is in process on the remaining four ships under contract with deliveries scheduled through 2011. The group product carrier program produced the increase in commercial shipbuilding volume in 2008. Construction of the first three ships ramped up in 2008, and the first ship was delivered in early 2009. The next two ships are scheduled to be delivered in the second half of 2009. In addition to the large ship-construction programs, sales increased on the group design and early-stage production contracts for the Navy. Most notably, volume increased on the group DDG-1000 next-generation destroyer program. The completion of the group SSGN submarine conversion contract in the fourth quarter of 2007 slightly offset the other volume increases in the group in 2008. The Marine Systems group improved its performance significantly in 2008, increasing operating earnings at double the rate of sales growth. As a result of operational efficiencies realized at each of its shipyards, the group increased program earnings rates in 2008 on the Virginia, DDG-51, T-AKE and commercial product carrier programs. These improvements generated an overall 100 basis-point increase in the group operating margins over 2007. We expect sales growth in the Marine Systems group of approximately 5 to 6 percent in 2009 as the group continues to deliver on its record backlog. We expect the group operating margins to increase slightly with continued operating efficiencies at each of the shipyards. Year Ended December 31 2007 2006 Variance Net sales $ 4,993 $ 4,940 $ 53 1.1 % Operating earnings 421 375 46 12.3 % Operating margin 8.4 % 7.6 % The Marine Systems group sales were up slightly in 2007 compared with 2006. Combined sales from the Virginia-class, T-AKE and Arleigh Burke destroyer programs in 2007 were essentially unchanged compared with 2006. Activity was up significantly on the T-AKE contract, but volume on the Virginia and Arleigh Burke programs declined in 2007. Volume was up across the group ship design, engineering, repair and overhaul, and early-stage construction programs for the Navy, including the detail design of the DDG-1000 and the construction of the first Littoral Combat Ship (LCS). Volume on these two programs increased more than 60 percent in 2007 compared with 2006. Additionally, activity was up more than 10 percent on the group engineering, repair and overhaul contracts for the Navy in 2007, particularly in the group nuclear submarine support and logistics services business. Combined sales on the group SSGN submarine conversion program and commercial ship construction programs decreased more than 50 percent during the year as the group completed its fourth and final SSGN submarine conversion in 2007 and its four-ship commercial tanker program in 2006. The Marine Systems group operating earnings and margins grew significantly in 2007 on steady sales. The group generated operating efficiencies that led to improved performance on several of its key programs, including the Virginia-class submarine, the Arleigh Burke-class destroyer and the SSGN submarine conversions. Additionally, we reached an agreement with the Navy in 2007 to restructure the T-AKE contract. The agreement included a resolution of an outstanding request for equitable adjustment (REA), which resulted in revised pricing on ships one through nine and the addition of five option ships. Prior to the agreement, we recognized revenue on the T-AKE program at a break-even level pending the resolution of the REA. After the contract restructuring, the program estimate at completion was revised, and we began recognizing profit on the contract in the second quarter of 2007. Backlog and Estimated Potential Contract Value The Marine Systems group backlog consists of long-term submarine and ship construction programs, as well as numerous repair and engineering contracts. At the end of 2008, the group backlog reached an all-time high of $26.4 billion, more than double the $12.1 billion backlog at the end of 2007. The group funded backlog increased 38 percent in 2008 to $10.5 billion at the end of the year. The group generally receives large contract awards that provide backlog for several years. The current backlog includes shipbuilding deliveries through 2018. The Virginia-class submarine program is the largest contract in the group backlog. The group backlog at year end included $18.1 billion for 13 Virginia-class submarines to be delivered through 2018. The group received $14.5 billion in Virginia-class orders in 2008, including a $13.8 billion Block III award for the construction of eight submarines. The contract included $2.3 billion of funding for construction of the first ship and long-lead materials for the second ship. As the prime contractor on the Virginia-class program, we report the entire backlog and sales associated with the program but share the construction and the earnings equally with our teaming partner. The current Navy plan calls General Dynamics 2008 Annual Report 27 Table of Contents for construction of one submarine in 2009 and 2010 and two per year from 2011 to 2013. The Marine Systems group backlog at year end also included $1.8 billion for the Navy T-AKE combat-logistics ship program. In 2008, the group received $1.6 billion in T-AKE orders, including the exercise of the options for ships 10 through 12 and long-lead materials for the 13th and 14th ships. Deliveries of these ships are scheduled through 2012. Navy destroyer programs represent another significant component of the group backlog. These include the Arleigh Burke-class DDG-51 and Zumwalt-class DDG-1000 destroyer programs. At year end, the backlog included approximately $765 for the remaining four DDG-51 destroyers under contract. Deliveries are scheduled through 2011, including two in 2009. In 2008, the group received one of two contracts worth approximately $1.4 billion for the construction of a DDG-1000 destroyer, scheduled to be delivered in 2013. The group backlog at the end of 2008 included $1.5 billion for the completion of the design effort and construction of the DDG-1000. The Navy is currently evaluating future DDG-51 and DDG-1000 production requirements. The group backlog at year-end 2008 also included $365 for a contract with U.S. Shipping Partners, L.P., for the remaining work in the construction of five product carriers under a potential nine-ship program. The five ships under contract are scheduled for delivery through 2011. The customer has indicated in public filings its reluctance to purchase ships six through nine. If the customer fails to exercise its options under the contract, we believe ample opportunity exists to remarket these ships. In addition, the Marine Systems group backlog at year end included approximately $3.5 billion in engineering, repair and overhaul programs. INFORMATION SYSTEMS AND TECHNOLOGY Results of Operations and Outlook Year Ended December 31 2008 2007 Variance Net sales $ 10,038 $ 9,622 $ 416 4.3 % Operating earnings 1,075 1,027 48 4.7 % Operating margin 10.7 % 10.7 % The Information Systems and Technology group net sales exceeded $10 billion for the first time in 2008, with the most significant growth over 2007 coming from the group tactical and strategic mission systems business. The group increase in sales in 2008 was attributable to the following: U.S. defense $ 555 Commercial wireless (86 ) United Kingdom (53 ) Total increase in sales $ 416 The group U.S. defense market consists of the tactical and strategic mission systems, information technology (IT) and mission services, and intelligence mission systems businesses. The tactical and strategic mission systems business generated double-digit sales growth in 2008. This growth resulted from increased activity on several key U.S. military programs, such as the Warfighter Information Network Tactical (WIN-T) program and the Common Hardware/Software III (CHS-3) program, as well as higher volume on the group ground-based satellite communications programs. The group provides fast, secure, mobile command-and-control capabilities to warfighters under WIN-T, and commercial and ruggedized computers, network equipment and software to the U.S. armed forces and other federal agencies worldwide under CHS-3. Sales were up in the group core IT services business due primarily to the ramp-up of activity on several new programs, including the group contract to provide technology operations and maintenance infrastructure support (TOMIS) services for the U.S. Bureau of Citizenship and Immigration and the Warfighter Field Operations Customer Support (FOCUS) contract. Under the Warfighter FOCUS program, the group provides support for the Army live, virtual and constructive training operations. Sales in the group intelligence mission systems business remained steady compared with 2007. The group commercial wireless operations experienced significantly lower activity in 2008 due to reduced demand in the market. However, sales in the commercial wireless business appeared to stabilize in the second half of 2008. Sales decreased in the group United Kingdom business due to a scheduled decline in activity on the BOWMAN communications program for the U.K. armed forces, offset in part by higher activity on other command, control, communications, computing and intelligence systems (C4I) programs. The BOWMAN program has reached a steady-state level of volume for the foreseeable future as the group continues ongoing logistics support and sustainment activity. The Information Systems and Technology group operating earnings increased at a rate consistent with sales growth. As a result, the group was able to maintain a 10.7 percent operating margin, equaling 2007 despite an increased proportion of lower-margin service work. We expect 8 percent sales growth in the Information Systems and Technology group in 2009 with contributions from each of the group businesses. We expect operating margins to be down 30 to 40 basis points compared with 2008 based on the scheduled contract mix in 2009. Year Ended December 31 2007 2006 Variance Net sales $ 9,622 $ 9,024 $ 598 6.6 % Operating earnings 1,027 976 51 5.2 % Operating margin 10.7 % 10.8 % Sales in the Information Systems and Technology group improved in 2007 compared with 2006, and operating earnings topped $1 billion for the first time. The group experienced 11 percent organic growth in its core North American tactical and strategic mission systems and IT and 28 General Dynamics 2008 Annual Report Table of Contents mission services businesses. The strong performance in the tactical and strategic mission systems business was due to higher activity on programs such as Combat Operations Centers (COC), CHS-3 and Mobile User Objective System (MUOS) as well as increased volume on the group ground-based satellite communications programs. The IT and mission services business benefited from the acquisition of Anteon International Corporation (Anteon) in June 2006 and higher volume in its core defense market on the strength of such programs as Intelligence Information, Command-and-Control Equipment and Enhancements (ICE2) and Network-Centric Solutions (NETCENTS). These increases were offset partially by an expected decline in volume on the U.K. BOWMAN program, reduced activity in the group intelligence mission systems business and a decline in activity in the commercial wireless market. The group operating margins were down by 10 basis points compared with 2006 due to the group shift to include more IT services content, including the acquisition of Anteon. Backlog and Estimated Potential Contract Value The Information Systems and Technology group backlog grew 7 percent in 2008 to $10.2 billion at year end, reflecting a book-to-bill ratio (in dollars) of 1.12 for the year. The group funded backlog on December 31 increased slightly compared with 2007 to $7.2 billion, representing approximately 70 percent of the group total backlog. Unlike our other defense businesses, the Information Systems and Technology group backlog consists of thousands of contracts that have to be reconstituted each year with new program and task order awards, and relatively few large-scale, long-term programs. Some of the more significant programs are highlighted below. The Army WIN-T program comprised over $790 of the group backlog at the end of 2008. Information Systems and Technology is the prime contractor on this battlefield communications network program that is designed to provide warfighters with fast, secure, mobile command-and-control capabilities. In 2008, the group received approximately $315 of awards for WIN-T, including a contract to provide specialized satellite communications earth terminals and technical support services for the first increment of the program. The group backlog at year end also included approximately $730 for the ICE2 program. ICE2 was the Information Systems and Technology group largest single program in 2008 and supports critical intelligence and command-and-control systems and networks for U.S. defense and intelligence operations worldwide. In 2008, the group received ICE2 orders of $960, bringing the total contract value since inception to $3.1 billion. Approximately $385 of the group backlog at year end was for the Canadian Maritime Helicopter Project (MHP). Under the MHP program, the group provides integrated mission systems for 28 state-of-the-art helicopters that are intended to replace Canada aging fleet of marine helicopters. Other programs that made up a significant portion of the group year-end backlog include approximately $310 for CHS-3, $200 for NETCENTS and $190 for Rescue 21, the search-and-rescue system for the U.S. Coast Guard. The group received $565 in orders under CHS-3 and over $160 of orders under the Rescue 21 program in 2008. In addition to these programs, the group received a number of significant contract awards in 2008, including the following: A contract from the National Geospatial Intelligence Agency worth approximately $375 to plan, engineer, design, install, test and operate the agency IT infrastructure. The contract has a total potential value of approximately $970 if all options are exercised. A contract worth approximately $265 for the system development and demonstration of the Integrated Computer System for the Army FCS program, bringing the total contract value to approximately $810. A contract from the U.S. Marine Corps worth $133 to produce units of the next-generation Tactical Data Network (TDN)-Data Distribution Systems-Modular (DDS-M), which provides secure, networked communication capabilities for deployed forces. The contract has a total potential value of $375 if all options are exercised. A contract worth $115 for design and implementation work on the next-generation Global Positioning System Space System program (GPS III) for the U.S. Air Force. An award valued at $114 to develop and integrate the maritime and fixed-site joint tactical radio capabilities and provide information assurance services for the Airborne Maritime and Fixed Site (AMF) Joint Tactical Radio System (JTRS). The contract has a potential value of over $150. A $110 order to build the spacecraft for NASA Landsat Data Continuity Mission. The group is designing and fabricating the spacecraft as well as providing testing and on-orbit engineering support. The group backlog does not include approximately $10.3 billion of estimated potential contract value associated with its anticipated share of IDIQ contracts and unexercised options. The value of these arrangements may be realized over the next 13 years. In 2008, funding under IDIQ contracts and options contributed over $3.5 billion, more than 30 percent of the group orders, to the group backlog, most notably from ICE2, CHS-3 and WIN-T. Information Systems and Technology was awarded several significant IDIQ contracts during 2008. The group was awarded a contract with a potential value of over $2 billion for the Warfighter FOCUS program. The group received approximately $215 in orders under this program in General Dynamics 2008 Annual Report 29 Table of Contents 2008. In addition, the group received an IDIQ contract from the Naval Air Systems Command with a potential value of over $180 for integrated logistics support for foreign military sales. CORPORATE Corporate results consist primarily of compensation expense for stock options and a portion of the earnings/cost from our commercial pension plans. Corporate operating expenses totaled $75 in 2008, $61 in 2007 and $47 in 2006. The increase in Corporate operating expense in 2008 and 2007 resulted primarily from increased stock option expense. (See Note P to the Consolidated Financial Statements for additional information regarding our stock options.) We expect 2009 stock option expense of approximately $80 to $85. The impact of the commercial pension plans on Corporate earnings was not significant in the past three years, and we do not expect it to be significant in 2009. FINANCIAL CONDITION, LIQUIDITY AND CAPITAL RESOURCES In the mid-1990s, General Dynamics embarked on a strategy of disciplined capital deployment, generating strong cash flow to enable a series of acquisitions designed to grow the company beyond our core platform businesses. These acquisitions incorporated new products and technologies and expanded our customer base. Since 1995, we have acquired 52 businesses for a total cost of almost $20 billion. These actions have resulted in a larger, more diversified company while preserving a strong balance sheet and sustained financial flexibility. Year Ended December 31 2008 2007 2006 Net cash provided by operating activities $ 3,110 $ 2,925 $ 2,128 Net cash used by investing activities (3,662 ) (852 ) (2,316 ) Net cash used by financing activities (718 ) (786 ) (539 ) Net (decrease) increase in cash and equivalents (1,270 ) 1,287 (727 ) Cash and equivalents at beginning of year 2,891 1,604 2,331 Cash and equivalents at end of year 1,621 2,891 1,604 Marketable securities 143 168 Short- and long-term debt (4,024 ) (2,791 ) (2,781 ) Net (debt) surplus (a) $ (2,260 ) $ 268 $ (1,177 ) Debt-to-equity (b) 40.0 % 23.7 % 28.3 % Debt-to-capital (c) 28.6 % 19.2 % 22.1 % (a) Net (debt) surplus is calculated as total debt less cash and equivalents and marketable securities. (b) Debt-to-equity ratio is calculated as total debt divided by total equity. (c) Debt-to-capital ratio is calculated as total debt divided by total debt plus total equity. Our cash balances are invested primarily in time deposits from highly rated banks, commercial paper rated A1/P1 or higher, and repurchase agreements with direct obligations of the Spanish government as collateral. Our marketable securities balances are invested primarily in high-quality corporate, municipal and U.S. government-sponsored debt securities. The marketable securities have an average duration of two months and an average credit rating of AA+. We have not incurred any losses associated with these investments. The following is a discussion of our major operating, investing and financing activities for each of the three years in the period ended December 31, 2008, as classified on the Consolidated Statement of Cash Flows. Operating Activities We generated cash from operating activities of $3.1 billion in 2008, $2.9 billion in 2007 and $2.1 billion in 2006. In each year, the two primary drivers of our cash flow were net earnings and increasing levels of customer deposits in the Aerospace group. In 2007, the cash flows from operating activities included the collection of approximately $270 of contract funds upon resolution of the Marine Systems group request for equitable adjustment on the T-AKE contract. In 2006, net earnings generated the majority of our operating cash flows, though approximately $150 of the net earnings related to a net gain on the sale of non-core businesses. The cash flow from these sales is reported in investing activities. Termination of A-12 Program. As discussed further in Note O to the Consolidated Financial Statements, litigation on the A-12 program termination has been ongoing since 1991. If, contrary to our expectations, the default termination ultimately is sustained, we, along with The Boeing Company, could collectively be required to repay the U.S. government as much as $1.4 billion for progress payments received for the A-12 contract, plus interest, which was approximately $1.4 billion at December 31, 2008. If this were the outcome, we would owe half of the total, or approximately $1.4 billion pretax. Our after-tax cash obligation would be approximately $690. We believe we have sufficient resources, including access to capital markets, to pay such an obligation, if required. Investing Activities We used $3.7 billion in 2008, $852 in 2007 and $2.3 billion in 2006 for investing activities. The primary uses of cash in investing activities were business acquisitions and capital expenditures. In 2007 and 2006, these uses of cash were partially reduced by proceeds from divestiture activities. Business Acquisitions. In 2008, we completed five acquisitions for a total of $3.2 billion. In 2007, we completed four acquisitions for a total of $330. In 2006, we completed three acquisitions for a total of $2.3 billion. We financed these acquisitions using cash on hand and commercial paper. (See Note B to the Consolidated Financial Statements for additional information regarding the acquisitions.) Capital Expenditures. Capital expenditures were $490 in 2008, $474 in 2007 and $334 in 2006. The increase in 2008 over 2007 resulted from continued facility improvements in the Aerospace group, which are 30 General Dynamics 2008 Annual Report Table of Contents substantially complete. The increase in 2007 over 2006 resulted from facility improvements in the Aerospace and the Marine Systems groups. We expect capital expenditures of approximately $475 in 2009, less than 2 percent of sales. We had no material commitments for capital expenditures on December 31, 2008. Sale of Assets. In 2007, we sold our coal mining operation for approximately $25 in cash, net of taxes. In 2006, we sold our aggregates business for approximately $315 in cash, net of taxes. Available-for-Sale Securities. As a result of our strong cash position, we have expanded our investments in available-for-sale securities in recent years. Net sales of these securities were $17 in 2008 compared with net purchases of $179 in 2007 and $12 in 2006. Financing Activities We used $718 in 2008, $786 in 2007 and $539 in 2006 for financing activities. Our typical financing activities are issuances and repayments of debt, payment of dividends and repurchases of common stock. Net cash from financing activities also includes proceeds received from stock option exercises. Debt Proceeds, Net. On December 15, 2008, we issued $1 billion of five-year fixed-rate debt pursuant to a Form S-3 Registration Statement filed with the Securities and Exchange Commission under the Securities Act of 1933 on December 8, 2008. We used the proceeds for general corporate purposes, including working capital requirements, capital expenditures, refinancing of existing indebtedness including commercial paper, and financing of acquisitions. We received net proceeds from commercial paper issuances in 2008 of $904, which were used primarily to fund business acquisitions. We had no commercial paper outstanding at the end of 2007 or 2006. We have approximately $2 billion in bank credit facilities that have not been drawn upon. These facilities provide backup liquidity to our commercial paper program. In 2008, we repaid $500 of fixed-rate debt, $150 of senior notes and $20 of term debt on the scheduled maturity dates. There were no material debt repayments in 2007. In 2006, we repaid $500 of our fixed-rate debt on the scheduled maturity date. There are no material repayments of long-term debt scheduled until the third quarter of 2010. Dividends. Our board of directors declared an increased quarterly dividend of $0.35 per share on March 5, 2008, the 11th consecutive annual increase. The board had previously increased the quarterly dividend to $0.29 per share in March 2007 and $0.23 per share in March 2006. Share Repurchases. In 2008, we repurchased 20 million of our outstanding shares on the open market. We repurchased 6.5 million shares in 2007 and 1.2 million shares in 2006 on the open market. As of December 31, 2008, approximately 4.9 million shares were authorized for repurchase by our board of directors about 1 percent of our total shares outstanding. Non-GAAP Management Metrics Our management emphasizes the efficient conversion of net earnings into cash and the deployment of that cash to maximize shareholder returns. In 2008, for the tenth consecutive year, net cash provided by operating activities exceeded net earnings. We deployed this cash to complete acquisitions, continue our trend of annual dividend increases and repurchase our outstanding shares. As a result of this continued focus on cash generation and disciplined capital deployment, our return on invested capital (ROIC) increased by 160 basis points during 2008 to 18.5 percent. Our ROIC has grown 520 basis points since 2004. We believe ROIC is a useful measure for investors, because it reflects our ability to generate returns from the capital we have deployed in our operations. We use ROIC to evaluate investment decisions and as a performance measure in evaluating management. We define ROIC as net operating profit after taxes divided by the sum of the average debt and shareholders equity for the year. Net operating profit after taxes is defined as earnings from continuing operations plus after-tax interest and amortization expense. ROIC for 2004 through 2008 is calculated as follows: Year Ended December 31 2008 2007 2006 2005 2004 Earnings from continuing operations $ 2,478 $ 2,080 $ 1,710 $ 1,448 $ 1,194 After-tax interest expense 91 89 106 108 106 After-tax amortization expense 100 99 90 70 62 Net operating profit after taxes 2,669 2,268 1,906 1,626 1,362 Average debt and equity $ 14,390 $ 13,430 $ 12,220 $ 10,948 $ 10,249 Return on invested capital 18.5 % 16.9 % 15.6 % 14.9 % 13.3 % General Dynamics 2008 Annual Report 31 Table of Contents Our free cash flow from operations was $2.6 billion in 2008, $2.5 billion in 2007, $1.8 billion in each of 2006 and 2005, and $1.5 billion in 2004. We define free cash flow from operations as net cash provided by operating activities from continuing operations less capital expenditures. We believe free cash flow from operations is a useful measure for investors, because it portrays our ability to generate cash from our core businesses for purposes such as repaying maturing debt, funding business acquisitions, repurchasing our common stock and paying dividends. We use free cash flow from operations to assess the quality of our earnings and as a performance measure in evaluating management. The following table reconciles the free cash flow from operations with net cash provided by operating activities from continuing operations, as classified on the Consolidated Statement of Cash Flows: Year Ended December 31 2008 2007 2006 2005 2004 Net cash provided by operating activities from continuing operations $ 3,124 $ 2,952 $ 2,156 $ 2,033 $ 1,760 Capital expenditures (490 ) (474 ) (334 ) (262 ) (253 ) Free cash flow from operations $ 2,634 $ 2,478 $ 1,822 $ 1,771 $ 1,507 Cash flow as a percentage of earnings from continuing operations: Net cash provided by operating activities from continuing operations 126 % 142 % 126 % 140 % 147 % Free cash flow from operations 106 % 119 % 107 % 122 % 126 % Over the past five years, we have generated free cash flow from operations well in excess of our earnings from continuing operations during the period, an average 115 percent conversion rate. We expect to continue to generate funds in excess of our short- and long-term liquidity needs. We believe we have adequate funds on hand and sufficient borrowing capacity to execute our financial and operating strategy. ADDITIONAL FINANCIAL INFORMATION Off-balance Sheet Arrangements As of December 31, 2008, other than operating leases, we had no material off-balance sheet arrangements, including guarantees; retained or contingent interests in assets transferred to unconsolidated entities; derivative instruments indexed to our stock and classified in shareholders equity on the Consolidated Balance Sheet; or variable interests in entities that provide us with financing, liquidity, market risk or credit risk support or engage with us in leasing, hedging or research and development services. Contractual Obligations and Commercial Commitments The following tables present information about our contractual obligations and commercial commitments as of December 31, 2008: Payments Due by Period Contractual Obligations Total Amount Committed Less Than 1 Year 2-3 Years 4-5 Years More Than 5 Years Long-term debt (a) $ 4,700 $ 1,040 $ 973 $ 1,213 $ 1,474 Capital lease obligations 2 1 1 Operating leases 1,081 205 304 167 405 Purchase obligations (b) 28,018 11,166 7,554 4,653 4,645 Other long-term liabilities (c) 12,337 1,930 1,963 1,558 6,886 $ 46,138 $ 14,342 $ 10,795 $ 7,591 $ 13,410 (a) Includes scheduled interest payments. See Note J to the Consolidated Financial Statements for discussion of long-term debt. (b) Includes amounts committed under legally enforceable agreements for goods and services with defined terms as to quantity, price and timing of delivery. This amount includes $21.6 billion of purchase orders for products and services to be delivered under firm government contracts under which we have full recourse under normal contract termination clauses. As disclosed in Note Q to the Consolidated Financial Statements, we expect to make approximately $260 of contributions to our retirement plans in 2009. This amount has been excluded from the above amount. (c) Represents other long-term liabilities on our Consolidated Balance Sheet, including the current portion of long-term liabilities. The projected timing of cash flows associated with these obligations is based on management's estimates, which are largely based on historical experience. This amount also includes all liabilities under our defined-benefit retirement plans, as discussed in Note Q. See Note Q for information regarding the plan assets available to satisfy these liabilities. Retirement plan assets and liabilities are presented net on the Consolidated Balance Sheet on a plan-by-plan basis. 32 General Dynamics 2008 Annual Report Table of Contents Amount of Commitment Expiration by Period Commercial Commitments Total Amount Committed Less Than 1 Year 2-3 Years 4-5 Years More Than 5 Years Letters of credit* $ 1,554 $ 837 $ 30 $ 242 $ 445 Trade-in options* 141 93 48 $ 1,695 $ 930 $ 78 $ 242 $ 445 * See Note O to the Consolidated Financial Statements for discussion of letters of credit and aircraft trade-in options. Application of Critical Accounting Policies Management Discussion and Analysis of our Financial Condition and Results of Operations is based on our Consolidated Financial Statements, which have been prepared in accordance with U.S. generally accepted accounting principles (GAAP). The preparation of financial statements in accordance with GAAP requires that we make estimates and assumptions that affect the reported amounts of assets and liabilities and the disclosure of contingent assets and liabilities at the date of the financial statements, as well as the reported amounts of revenues and expenses during the reporting period. On an ongoing basis, we evaluate our estimates, including those related to long-term contracts and programs, goodwill and other intangible assets, income taxes, pensions and other post-retirement benefits, workers compensation, warranty obligations, pre-owned aircraft inventory, and contingencies and litigation. We base our estimates on historical experience and on various other assumptions that we believe to be reasonable under the circumstances. The results of these estimates form the basis for making judgments about the carrying values of assets and liabilities that are not readily available from other sources. Actual results may differ from these estimates under different assumptions or conditions. We believe the following policies are critical and require the use of significant business judgment in their application: Revenue Recognition. We account for sales and earnings in our defense and aerospace businesses using the percentage-of-completion method of accounting. Under the percentage-of-completion method, we recognize contract revenue as the work progresses either as the products are produced and delivered or as services are rendered, as applicable. We estimate profit as the difference between total estimated revenue and total estimated cost of a contract and recognize that profit over the remaining life of the contract based on either input measures (e.g., costs incurred) or output measures (e.g., contract milestones or units delivered), as appropriate to the circumstances. Where an interim output measure is reliably determinable and representative of progress toward completion, we use such output measures. Otherwise, we use input measures. We generally measure progress toward completion on contracts in our defense businesses based on the proportion of costs incurred to date relative to total estimated costs at completion or based on unit deliveries under the contract. Our contracts for the manufacture of business-jet aircraft usually provide for two major phases: the manufacture of the green aircraft (i.e., before exterior painting and installation of customer-selected interiors and optional avionics) and its completion. We record revenue at two contractual milestones: when green aircraft are delivered to, and accepted by, the customer and when the customer accepts final delivery of the fully outfitted aircraft. We do not recognize revenue at green delivery unless (1) a contract has been executed with the customer and (2) the customer can be expected to satisfy its obligations under the contract, as evidenced by the receipt of deposits from the customer and other factors. We follow the guidelines of American Institute of Certified Public Accountants (AICPA) Statement of Position 81-1, Accounting for Performance of Construction-Type and Certain Production-Type Contracts. However, we include revisions of estimated profits on contracts in earnings under the reallocation method, in accordance with Accounting Principles Board Opinion No. 20, Accounting Changes (which has been superseded by Statement of Financial Accounting Standards (SFAS) No. 154, Accounting Changes and Error Corrections), rather than the cumulative catch-up method. Under the reallocation method, the impact of revisions in estimates is recognized prospectively over the remaining contract term, while under the cumulative catch-up method such impact would be recognized immediately. If a revised estimate of contract profitability reveals an anticipated loss on the contract, we recognize the loss in the period it is identified. Anticipated losses cover all costs allocable to the contracts, including G&A expenses on government contracts. We use the reallocation method because we believe the majority of factors that typically result in changes in estimates of total contract revenue, total costs or the extent of progress toward completion on our long-term contracts affect both the period in which the change is identified and future periods. We believe these changes generally reflect expectations as to future performance and, therefore, the reallocation method is the method that best matches our revenues and earnings in the periods in which they are earned. While we have applied this method consistently for more than 30 years, most contractors use the cumulative catch-up method. The percentage-of-completion method of accounting involves the use of various estimating techniques to project costs at completion, and in some cases includes estimates of recoveries asserted against the customer for changes in specifications. Contract estimates involve various assumptions and projections relative to the outcome of future events over a period of several years, including future labor productivity and availability, the nature and complexity of the work to be performed, the cost and availability of materials, the impact of delayed performance, the availability and timing of funding from the customer, and the timing of product deliveries. These estimates are based on our best judgment. A significant change in one or more of these estimates could affect the profitability of one or more General Dynamics 2008 Annual Report 33 Table of Contents of our contracts. We review our contract estimates periodically to assess revisions in contract values and estimated costs at completion and reflect changes in estimates in the current and future periods under the reallocation method. We recognize revenue arising from claims either as income or as an offset against a potential loss only when the amount of the claim can be estimated reliably and its realization is probable. In evaluating these criteria, we consider the contractual/legal basis for the claim, the cause of any additional costs incurred, the reasonableness of those costs and the objective evidence available to support the claim. We recognize revenue from award or incentive fees when there is a basis to reasonably estimate the amount of the fee. Estimates of award or incentive fees are based on actual award experience and anticipated performance. Goodwill. Since 1995, we have acquired 52 businesses at a total cost of almost $20 billion, including five in 2008. In connection with these acquisitions, we have recognized $11.4 billion of goodwill. Goodwill represents the purchase price paid in excess of the fair value of identifiable net tangible and intangible assets acquired. Goodwill is not amortized but is subject to an impairment test on an annual basis and when circumstances indicate that an impairment is more likely than not. The test for goodwill impairment is a two-step process that requires a significant level of estimation by management, particularly the estimate of the fair value of our reporting units. These estimates require the use of judgment. We estimate the fair value of our reporting units based on the discounted projected cash flows of the underlying operations. This requires numerous assumptions, including the timing of work embedded in our backlog, our performance and profitability under our contracts, our success in securing future business, and the appropriate interest rate used to discount the projected cash flows. This discounted cash flow analysis is corroborated by top-down analyses, including a market assessment of our enterprise value. Beyond the annual impairment test, factors that may lead us to perform a goodwill impairment test include a significant adverse change in the business climate for one of our reporting units or a decision to dispose of a reporting unit or a significant portion of a reporting unit. We have recorded no goodwill impairment to date and do not anticipate any reasonably possible circumstances that would lead to an impairment in the foreseeable future. Commitments and Contingencies. We are subject to litigation and other legal proceedings arising either out of the ordinary course of our business or under provisions relating to the protection of the environment. Estimating liabilities and costs associated with these matters requires the use of judgment. We record a charge against earnings when a liability associated with claims or pending or threatened litigation matters is probable and when our exposure is reasonably estimable. The ultimate resolution of our exposure related to these matters may change as further facts and circumstances become known. Deferred Contract Costs. Certain costs incurred in the performance of our government contracts are recorded under GAAP but are not currently allocable to contracts. Such costs include a portion of our estimated workers compensation, other insurance-related assessments, pension and other post-retirement benefits, and environmental expenses. These costs will become allocable to contracts generally when they are paid. As permitted by AICPA Audit and Accounting Guide, Federal Government Contractors, we have elected to defer (or inventory) these costs in contracts in process until they are paid, at which time the costs are charged to contracts and recovered from the government. We expect to recover these costs through ongoing business, including existing backlog and probable follow-on contracts. This business base includes numerous contracts for which we are the sole source or one of two suppliers on long-term defense programs. We regularly assess the probability of recovery of these costs under our current and probable follow-on contracts. This assessment requires that we make assumptions about future contract costs, the extent of cost recovery under our contracts and the amount of future contract activity. These estimates are based on our best judgment. If the backlog in the future does not support the continued deferral of these costs, the profitability of our remaining contracts could be adversely affected. Retirement Plans. Our defined-benefit pension and other post-retirement benefit costs and obligations depend on various assumptions and estimates. The key assumptions relate to the interest rates used to discount estimated future liabilities and projected long-term rates of return on plan assets. We determine the discount rate used each year based on the rate of return currently available on a portfolio of high-quality fixed-income investments with a maturity that is consistent with the projected benefit payout period. We determine the long-term rate of return on assets based on historical returns and the current and expected asset allocation strategy. These estimates are based on our best judgment, including consideration of current and future market conditions. In the event a change in any of the assumptions is warranted, future pension and post-retirement benefit cost could increase or decrease. The following hypothetical changes in the discount rate and expected long-term rate of return on plan assets for our commercial pension and post-retirement benefit plans would have had the following impact on 2008: Increase 25 bps Decrease 25 bps Increase (decrease) to net pension cost from: Change in discount rate $ (2 ) $ 3 Change in long-term rate of return on plan assets (3 ) 3 Increase (decrease) to post-retirement benefit cost from: Change in discount rate $ (1 ) $ 1 Change in long-term rate of return on plan assets (1 ) 1 As discussed under Deferred Contract Costs, our contractual arrangements with the U.S. government provide for the recovery of contributions to our government retirement plans. As permitted by AICPA Audit and Accounting Guide, Federal Government Contractors, we have elected to defer recognition of the cumulative net unfunded benefit cost in our government plans to provide a better matching of revenues and expenses. As such, the impact on the retirement benefit cost for these plans that 34 General Dynamics 2008 Annual Report Table of Contents results from annual changes in assumptions does not impact our future earnings either positively or negatively. We believe that our judgment is applied consistently and produces financial information that fairly depicts the results of operations for all periods presented. New Accounting Standards In March 2008, the FASB issued SFAS No. 161, Disclosures about Derivative Instruments and Hedging Activities An Amendment of FASB Statement No. 133. SFAS 161 expands and enhances required disclosures related to derivatives and hedging instruments. SFAS 161 is effective in the first quarter of 2009. We do not expect the adoption of SFAS 161 to have a material effect on our results of operations, financial condition or cash flows. In December 2007, the FASB issued SFAS No. 160, Noncontrolling Interests in Consolidated Financial Statements An Amendment of ARB No. 51. SFAS 160 establishes new accounting for noncontrolling interests in a subsidiary and for the deconsolidation of a subsidiary. SFAS 160 is effective in the first quarter of 2009. We do not expect the adoption of SFAS 160 to have a material effect on our results of operations, financial condition or cash flows. In December 2007, the FASB issued SFAS No. 141 (revised 2007), Business Combinations. SFAS 141R changes the requirements for accounting for business combinations, including the determination of purchase price and assignment of purchase price to acquired assets and assumed liabilities. The primary effect of SFAS 141R is to increase earnings volatility associated with business combinations, including a requirement to charge acquisition and restructuring costs to earnings rather than including the costs in the purchase price, and a modification of the guidelines for recognizing intangible assets, which may increase the value assigned to intangible assets and the resulting amortization expense associated with future acquisitions. SFAS 141R is effective for our acquisitions that are completed after December 31, 2008.
