ITEM 7. Management's Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations ORGANIZATION OF INFORMATION The following Management's Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations (MD&A) was prepared to provide the reader with a view and perspective of our business through the eyes of management and should be read in conjunction with our Consolidated Financial Statements and the accompanying notes to those financial statements. Our MD&A is presented in the following sections: Executive Summary and Financial Highlights 2015 Outlook Results of Operations Operating Segment Results Liquidity and Capital Resources Contractual Obligations and Other Commercial Commitments Application of Critical Accounting Estimates Recently Adopted and Recently Issued Accounting Pronouncements EXECUTIVE SUMMARY AND FINANCIAL HIGHLIGHTS We are a global power leader that designs, manufactures, distributes and services diesel and natural gas engines and engine-related component products, including filtration, aftertreatment, turbochargers, fuel systems, controls systems, air handling systems and electric power generation systems. We sell our products to original equipment manufacturers (OEMs), distributors and other customers worldwide. We have long-standing relationships with many of the leading manufacturers in the markets we serve, including PACCAR Inc, Daimler Trucks North America, Chrysler Group, LLC (Chrysler), Volvo AB, Komatsu, Navistar International Corporation, Aggreko plc, Ford Motor Company and MAN Nutzfahrzeuge AG. We serve our customers through a network of approximately 600 company-owned and independent distributor locations and approximately 7,200 dealer locations in more than 190 countries and territories. Our reportable operating segments consist of the following: Engine, Distribution, Components and Power Generation. This reporting structure is organized according to the products and markets each segment serves . The Engine segment produces engines and parts for sale to customers in on-highway and various industrial markets. Our engines are used in trucks of all sizes, buses and recreational vehicles, as well as in various industrial applications, including construction, mining, agriculture, marine, oil and gas, rail and military equipment. The Distribution segment includes wholly-owned and partially-owned distributorships engaged in wholesaling engines, generator sets and service parts, as well as performing service and repair activities on our products and maintaining relationships with various OEMs throughout the world. The Components segment sells filtration products, aftertreatment systems, turbochargers and fuel systems. The Power Generation segment is an integrated provider of power systems, which sells engines, generator sets and alternators. Our financial performance depends, in large part, on varying conditions in the markets we serve, particularly the on-highway, construction and general industrial markets. Demand in these markets tends to fluctuate in response to overall economic conditions. Our sales may also be impacted by OEM inventory levels and production schedules and stoppages. Economic downturns in markets we serve generally result in reduced sales of our products and can result in price reductions in certain products and/or markets. As a worldwide business, our operations are also affected by currency, political, economic and regulatory matters, including adoption and enforcement of environmental and emission standards, in the countries we serve. As part of our growth strategy, we invest in businesses in certain countries that carry high levels of these risks such as China, Brazil, India, Mexico, Russia and countries in the Middle East and Africa. At the same time, our geographic diversity and broad product and service offerings have helped limit the impact from a drop in demand in any one industry or customer or the economy of any single country on our consolidated results. Worldwide revenues improved 11 percent in 2014 compared to 2013 , primarily due to the improvements in North American on-highway demand and the consolidation of partially owned North American distributors. Revenue in the U.S. and Canada improved by 20 percent primarily due to increased demand in the North American on-highway markets driving sales in both the Engine and Components segments, as well as improved Distribution segment sales related to the consolidation of partially- 31 Table of Contents owned North American distributors since December 31, 2012. These increases were partially offset by the reduced demand in the North American power generation markets primarily due to lower military sales. Amid the continued international economic uncertainty in 2014, our international revenues remained flat compared to 2013. International revenues increased in the Components segment, especially the emission solutions business in Western Europe and China due to additional content as the result of new emission regulations, while the Distribution segment revenues improved due to demand growth in Africa and Asia Pacific. These increases were offset by decreased international on-highway demand with decreased shipments of 7 percent and 11 percent in the heavy-duty and medium-duty truck markets, respectively, and decreased demand in international power generation markets. The following table contains sales and EBIT (defined as earnings before interest expense, taxes and noncontrolling interests) results by operating segment for the years ended December 31, 2014 and 2013 . Refer to the section titled "Operating Segment Results" for a more detailed discussion of net sales and EBIT by operating segment including the reconciliation of segment EBIT to income before income taxes.

The increase in net income and earnings per share was driven by improved gross margin, partially offset by higher selling, general and administrative expenses. The improved gross margin was the result of higher volumes, improved Distribution segment sales related to the consolidation of partially-owned North American distributors since December 31, 2012 , lower material and commodity costs and favorable mix, partially offset by unfavorable foreign currency fluctuations. Diluted earnings per share for 2014 benefited $0.16 from lower shares outstanding, primarily due to purchases under the stock repurchase program. We generated $2.3 billion of operating cash flows in 2014 , compared to $2.1 billion in 2013 . Refer to the section titled "Operating Activities" in the "Liquidity and Capital Resources" section for a discussion of items impacting cash flows. In September 2013, we announced our intention to acquire the equity that we do not already own in most of our partially-owned United States and Canadian distributors over the next three to five years . During 2014, we spent $460 million on these acquisitions and the related debt retirements. We plan to spend an additional $170 million to $210 million on North American distributor acquisitions and the related debt retirements in 2015. Refer to Note 2 , " ACQUISITIONS ," to the Consolidated Financial Statements for additional information. During 2014 , we repurchased $670 million of common stock under the 2012 Board of Directors authorized plan. In July 2014, our Board of Directors authorized the acquisition of up to $1 billion of additional common stock upon the completion of the 2012 repurchase plan. In the fourth quarter of 2014, we exercised our option to extend the maturity date of our revolving credit agreement by one year from November 9, 2017, to November 9, 2018. In December 2014, Moody's Investors Service, Inc. raised our rating to 'A2' and confirmed our outlook as stable. In July 2014, the Board of Directors authorized a dividend increase of approximately 25 percent from $0.625 per share to $0.78 per share on a quarterly basis. 32 Table of Contents Our debt to capital ratio (capital is defined as debt plus equity) at December 31, 2014 , was 17.3 percent , compared to 18.1 percent at December 31, 2013 . As of the date of filing this Annual Report on Form 10-K, we had an 'A+' credit rating with a 'Stable' outlook from Standard & Poor Rating Services, an 'A' credit rating with a 'Stable' outlook from Fitch Ratings and an 'A2' credit rating with a 'Stable' outlook from Moody Investors Service, Inc. In addition to our $2.4 billion in cash and marketable securities on hand, we have sufficient access to our credit facilities, if necessary, to meet currently anticipated investment and funding needs. Our global pension plans, including our unfunded and non-qualified plans, were 108 percent funded at December 31, 2014. Our U.S. qualified plan, which represents approximately 56 percent of the worldwide pension obligation, was 119 percent funded and our United Kingdom (U.K.) plan was 113 percent funded. We expect to contribute $175 million to our global pension plans in 2015 . We anticipate pension and other postretirement benefit cost in 2015 to increase by approximately $3 million pre-tax, or $0.01 per diluted share, when compared to 2014. The increase is due to lower discount rates and unfavorable demographics mostly offset by favorable expected return on asset performance. Refer to application of critical accounting estimates within MD&A and Note 11 , " PENSION AND OTHER POSTRETIREMENT BENEFITS ," to the Consolidated Financial Statements , for additional information concerning our pension and other post-retirement benefit plans. 2015 OUTLOOK Near-Term We currently expect the following positive trends in 2015 : We expect the North American heavy-duty and medium-duty on-highway markets to increase in 2015 as compared to the market in 2014. We expect the new ISG engine, which began production in the second quarter of 2014 with our Beijing Foton Cummins Engine Co., Ltd. joint venture, to continue to gain market share in China in its first full year of production. We plan to continue acquiring our partially-owned North American distributors, which will increase our Distribution segment revenues. Demand in some end markets in India are expected to begin to experience growth during the year. We currently expect the following challenges to our business that may reduce our revenue and earnings potential in 2015 : Power generation markets are expected to remain weak. Weak economic growth in Brazil could continue to negatively impact our on-highway and power generation businesses. We do not anticipate end markets in China to improve. Demand in certain European markets could remain weak due to continued political and economic uncertainty. Growth in emerging markets could be negatively impacted if emission regulations are not strictly enforced. Foreign currency volatility could continue to put pressure on revenue and earnings. We expect market demand to decline in the oil and gas markets as the result of the lower crude oil prices. Domestic and international mining markets could continue to deteriorate if commodity prices weaken. Long-Term We believe that, over the longer term, there will be economic improvements in most of our current markets and that our opportunities for long-term profitable growth will continue in the future as the result of the following four macroeconomic trends that will benefit our businesses: tightening emissions controls across the world; infrastructure needs in emerging markets; energy availability and cost issues; and globalization of industries like ours. 33 Table of Contents RESULTS OF OPERATIONS Favorable/(Unfavorable) Years ended December 31, 2014 vs. 2013 2013 vs. 2012 In millions (except per share amounts) 2014 2013 2012 Amount Percent Amount Percent NET SALES $ 19,221 $ 17,301 $ 17,334 $ 1,920 11 % $ (33 ) % Cost of sales 14,360 13,021 12,918 (1,339 ) (10 )% (103 ) (1 )% GROSS MARGIN 4,861 4,280 4,416 581 14 % (136 ) (3 )% OPERATING EXPENSES AND INCOME Selling, general and administrative expenses 2,095 1,817 1,808 (278 ) (15 )% (9 ) % Research, development and engineering expenses 754 713 728 (41 ) (6 )% 15 2 % Equity, royalty and interest income from investees 370 361 384 9 2 % (23 ) (6 )% Other operating income (expense), net (17 ) (10 ) (10 ) (7 ) 70 % % OPERATING INCOME 2,365 2,101 2,254 264 13 % (153 ) (7 )% Interest income 23 27 25 (4 ) (15 )% 2 8 % Interest expense 64 41 32 (23 ) (56 )% (9 ) (28 )% Other income (expense), net 110 32 24 78 NM 8 33 % INCOME BEFORE INCOME TAXES 2,434 2,119 2,271 315 15 % (152 ) (7 )% Income tax expense 698 531 533 (167 ) (31 )% 2 % CONSOLIDATED NET INCOME 1,736 1,588 1,738 148 9 % (150 ) (9 )% Less: Net income attributable to noncontrolling interests 85 105 93 20 19 % (12 ) (13 )% NET INCOME ATTRIBUTABLE TO CUMMINS INC . $ 1,651 $ 1,483 $ 1,645 $ 168 11 % $ (162 ) (10 )% Diluted earnings per common share attributable to Cummins Inc. $ 9.02 $ 7.91 $ 8.67 $ 1.11 14 % $ (0.76 ) (9 )% _____________________________________________________ "NM" - not meaningful information Favorable/(Unfavorable)Percentage Points Percent of sales 2014 2013 2012 2014 vs. 2013 2013 vs. 2012 Gross margin 25.3 % 24.7 % 25.5 % 0.6 (0.8 ) Selling, general and administrative expenses 10.9 % 10.5 % 10.4 % (0.4 ) (0.1 ) Research, development and engineering expenses 3.9 % 4.1 % 4.2 % 0.2 0.1 2014 vs. 2013 Net Sales Net sales increase d versus 2013 primarily driven by the following: Distribution segment sales increase d by 38 percent primarily due to the acquisitions of North American distributors. Engine segment sales increase d by 9 percent due to higher demand in the North American on-highway markets. Components segment sales increase d by 18 percent primarily due to higher demand in on-highway markets in North America, Europe and China. The increase s were partially offset by the following: Power Generation segment sales decrease d by 4 percent mainly due to lower volumes within power products, alternators and power systems. Foreign currency fluctuations unfavorably impacted sales by approximately 1 percent (primarily in Brazil and India). Sales to international markets (excluding the U.S. and Canada), based on location of customers, were 44 percent of total net sales in 2014 , compared with 48 percent of total net sales in 2013 . A more detailed discussion of sales by segment is presented in the OPERATING SEGMENT RESULTS section. 34 Table of Contents Gross Margin Gross margin increased by $581 million and as a percentage of sales by 0.6 percentage points as higher volumes, improved Distribution segment sales related to the consolidation of partially-owned North American distributors since December 31, 2012 , lower material and commodity costs and favorable mix, were partially offset by unfavorable foreign currency fluctuations (primarily in Australia, Europe and Canada). The provision for warranties issued, excluding campaigns, as a percentage of sales was 2.0 percent in 2014 and 2.1 percent in 2013 . A more detailed discussion of margin by segment is presented in the "OPERATING SEGMENT RESULTS" section. Selling, General and Administrative Expenses Selling, general and administrative expenses increased primarily due to higher compensation and related expenses of $118 million and increased consulting fees of $28 million. These increases were significantly impacted by the acquisition of our partially owned North American distributors since December 31, 2012. Compensation and related expenses include salaries, fringe benefits and variable compensation. Overall, selling, general and administrative expenses, as a percentage of sales, increased to 10.9 percent in 2014 from 10.5 percent in 2013 . Research, Development and Engineering Expenses Research, development and engineering expenses increased primarily due to higher compensation and related expenses of $44 million, partially offset by decreased consulting expenses of $7 million and increased expense recovery of $7 million. Compensation and related expenses include salaries, fringe benefits and variable compensation. Overall, research, development and engineering expenses, as a percentage of sales, decreased to 3.9 percent in 2014 from 4.1 percent in 2013 . Research activities continue to focus on development of new products to meet future emission standards around the world and improvements in fuel economy performance. Equity, Royalty and Interest Income From Investees Equity, royalty and interest income from investees increase d primarily due to the following: In millions 2014 vs. 2013 Increase/(Decrease) Beijing Foton Cummins Engine Co., Ltd. (Light-duty) $ 11 Komatsu Cummins Chile, Ltda. 4 Dongfeng Cummins Engine Company, Ltd. 4 Chongqing Cummins Engine Company, Ltd. (7 ) Beijing Foton Cummins Engine Co., Ltd. (Heavy-duty) (9 ) North American distributors (22 ) All other 24 Cummins share of net income 5 Royalty and interest income 4 Equity, royalty and interest income from investees $ 9 The increase s above were primarily due to increased earnings at Beijing Foton Cummins Engine Co., Ltd. (Light-duty) , Komatsu Cummins Chile, Ltda. and Dongfeng Cummins Engine Company, Ltd. , partially offset by the consolidation of the partially-owned North American distributors since December 31, 2012 and losses at Beijing Foton Cummins Engine Co., Ltd. (Heavy-duty) as the result of increased expenses related to the production launch of the 2014 product in the second quarter of 2014. As we execute our plan to acquire partially-owned distributors, we expect equity earnings for our North American distributors to decrease as the earnings will be included in our consolidated results. See Note 2 , ACQUISITIONS , to the Consolidated Financial Statements for further information. 35 Table of Contents Other Operating Income (Expense), Net Other operating income (expense), net was as follows: Years ended December 31, In millions 2014 2013 Loss on write off of assets $ (23 ) $ (14 ) Amortization of intangible assets (16 ) (11 ) Royalty expense (7 ) (4 ) Legal matters (3 ) (2 ) Royalty income 34 20 Other, net (2 ) 1 Total other operating income (expense), net $ (17 ) $ (10 ) Interest Income Interest income decreased in 2014 , primarily due to an interest income recovery of a loan previously deemed unrecoverable in the second quarter of 2013 . Interest Expense Interest expense increased as a result of the $1 billion debt issuance in September 2013. Other Income (Expense), Net Other income (expense), net was as follows: Years ended December 31, In millions 2014 2013 Gain on fair value adjustment for consolidated investee (1) $ 73 $ 12 Change in cash surrender value of corporate owned life insurance 24 12 Gain on marketable securities, net 14 13 Dividend income 3 5 Foreign currency loss, net (6 ) (27 ) Bank charges (12 ) (10 ) Other, net 14 27 Total other income (expense), net $ 110 $ 32 ____________________________________________________________ (1) See Note 2 , ACQUISITIONS ," to the Consolidated Financial Statements for more details. Income Tax Expense Our income tax rates are generally less than the 35 percent U.S. statutory income tax rate primarily because of lower taxes on foreign earnings and research tax credits. Our effective tax rate for 2014 was 28.7 percent compared to 25.1 percent for 2013 . The 3.6 percent increase in the effective tax rate from 2013 to 2014 is partially due to a 1.2 percent net tax benefit for one-time items in 2013 that did not repeat in 2014. These 2013 one-time items consisted primarily of the 2012 federal research tax credit that was reinstated during 2013. The additional 2.4 percent increase in tax rate from 2013 to 2014 is attributable primarily to the following unfavorable items that occurred in 2014: a tax law change in the U.K. resulting in a higher limitation on the deductibility of interest; unfavorable changes in the jurisdictional mix of pretax income; and increases in state valuation allowances. We evaluate the recoverability of our deferred tax assets each quarter by assessing the likelihood of future profitability and available tax planning strategies that could be implemented to realize our net deferred tax assets. At December 31, 2014, we recorded net deferred tax assets of $184 million . These assets included $190 million for the value of tax loss and credit carryforwards. A valuation allowance of $144 million was recorded to reduce the tax assets to the net value management believed was more likely than not to be realized. In the event our operating performance deteriorates, future assessments could conclude that a larger valuation allowance will be needed to further reduce the deferred tax assets. 36 Table of Contents We expect our 2015 effective tax rate to be 29.5 percent , excluding any discrete items that may arise. The research tax credit expired December 31, 2014, and has not yet been renewed by Congress. If the research credit is reinstated during 2015, we would anticipate the 2015 effective tax rate to be reduced to 28.5 percent, consistent with the 2014 rate of 28.7 percent . Noncontrolling Interests Noncontrolling interests eliminate the income or loss attributable to non-Cummins ownership interests in our consolidated entities. Noncontrolling interests in income of consolidated subsidiaries decrease d primarily due to a $23 million decline from the acquisition of the remaining interest in previously consolidated North American distributors since December 31, 2012 . Net Income Attributable to Cummins Inc. and Diluted Earnings Per Share Attributable to Cummins Inc. Net income and diluted earnings per share attributable to Cummins Inc. increase d primarily due to higher gross margin, mainly driven by improved volumes and improved Distribution segment sales related to the consolidation of partially-owned North American distributors since December 31, 2012. These increase s were partially offset by higher selling, general and administrative expenses and a higher effective tax rate of 28.7 percent in 2014 versus 25.1 percent in 2013. Diluted earnings per share for 2014 benefited $0.16 from lower shares outstanding, primarily due to purchases under the stock repurchase program. 2013 vs. 2012 Net Sales Net sales decreased slightly versus 2012 and was primarily driven by the following: Engine segment sales decreased by 7 percent due to lower demand in the power generation markets, weaker demand in the North American heavy-duty truck markets and continued weakness in industrial demand, primarily in off-high-way mining markets. Power Generation segment sales decreased by 7 percent due to lower demand in the power solutions business, primarily in the U.K., and lower demand in the power systems and the alternators businesses in international markets, partially offset by improvements in the North American power product business. Foreign currency fluctuations unfavorably impacted sales by 1 percent. The decreases were partially offset by the following: Distribution segment sales increased by 14 percent primarily due to incremental sales in 2013 related to the consolidation of partially-owned North American distributors since June 2012. Components segment sales increased by 8 percent due to higher sales within the emission solutions business, mainly related to improved on-highway OEM and aftermarket demand in North America, a full year of sales from Hilite which was acquired in the third quarter of 2012, 2013 pre-buy activity in anticipation of the Euro VI emission standards and growth in the medium-duty Brazilian truck market resulting in improved aftertreatment demand. A more detailed discussion of sales by segment is presented in the "OPERATING SEGMENT RESULTS" section. Sales to international markets (excluding the U.S. and Canada) were 48 percent of total net sales in 2013, compared with 49 percent of total net sales in 2012. Gross Margin Gross margin decreased by $125 million and as a percentage of sales by 0.7 percentage points. The decrease in gross margin as a percentage of sales was primarily due to a decline in demand for high-horsepower engines and gensets, partially offset by improved price realization, lower material and commodity costs and the absence of 2012 restructuring charges of $29 million. The provision for warranties issued, excluding campaigns, as a percentage of sales was 2.1 percent in both 2013 and 2012. A more detailed discussion of margin by segment is presented in the "OPERATING SEGMENT RESULTS" section. 37 Table of Contents Selling, General and Administrative Expenses Selling, general and administrative expenses increased primarily due to incremental costs in 2013 related to the acquisition of partially owned North American distributors since June 2012. These costs primarily contributed to increased compensation and related expenses of $57 million, partially offset by lower consulting of $24 million, the absence of 2012 restructuring charges of $20 million and reduced discretionary spending. Higher compensation expense was primarily due to increased headcount to support our strategic growth initiatives. Compensation and related expenses include salaries, fringe benefits and variable compensation. Overall, selling, general and administrative expenses, as a percentage of sales, increased to 11.1 percent in 2013 from 11.0 percent in 2012. Research, Development and Engineering Expenses Research, development and engineering expenses decreased primarily due to lower consulting of $30 million and decreased engineering program spending of $23 million, partially offset by increases of $52 million in compensation related expenses. Higher compensation expense was primarily due to increased headcount to support our strategic growth initiatives. Compensation and related expenses include salaries and fringe benefits. Overall, research, development and engineering expenses, as a percentage of sales, decreased to 4.1 percent in 2013 from 4.2 percent in 2012. Equity, Royalty and Interest Income From Investees Equity, royalty and interest income from investees decreased primarily due to the following: In millions 2013 vs. 2012 Increase/(Decrease) North American distributors $ (18 ) Cummins Westport, Inc.

Income Tax Expense Our income tax rates are generally less than the 35 percent U.S. statutory income tax rate primarily because of lower taxes on foreign earnings and research tax credits. Our effective tax rate for 2013 was 25.1 percent compared to 23.5 percent for 2012. As a result of a restructuring of our foreign operations in 2013, our 2013 effective tax rate was approximately 1 percent less than it would have been without restructuring. On January 2, 2013, the American Taxpayer Relief Act of 2012 was signed into law and reinstated the research tax credit back to 2012. As tax law changes are accounted for in the period of enactment, we recognized a $28 million discrete tax benefit in the first quarter of 2013. We also recognized a discrete tax expense of $17 million in the first quarter which primarily related to the write-off of a deferred tax asset deemed unrecoverable. Also included in 2013 was a third quarter discrete net tax expense of $7 million primarily related to U.S. federal tax return true-up adjustments and the third quarter enactment of U.K tax law changes. Additionally, our effective tax rate for 2013 also included a fourth quarter discrete net tax benefit of $21 million primarily due to the release of U.S. deferred tax liabilities related to prior years unremitted income of certain Indian and Mexican subsidiaries now considered to be permanently reinvested, as well as adjustments to our income tax accounts principally based on our 2012 state tax return filings. Our 2012 income tax provision included a one-time $134 million tax benefit which resulted from tax planning strategies and tax return elections made with respect to our U.K. operations. We evaluate the recoverability of our deferred tax assets each quarter by assessing the likelihood of future profitability and available tax planning strategies that could be implemented to realize our net deferred tax assets. At December 31, 2013, we recorded net deferred tax assets of $177 million. These assets included $187 million for the value of tax loss and credit carryforwards. A valuation allowance of $101 million was recorded to reduce the tax assets to the net value management believed was more likely than not to be realized. In the event our operating performance deteriorates, future assessments could conclude that a larger valuation allowance will be needed to further reduce the deferred tax assets. Noncontrolling Interests Noncontrolling interests in income of consolidated subsidiaries increased reflecting our minority's share of higher profits of $7 million at Cummins Western Canada LP, $6 million at Wuxi Cummins Turbo Technologies Co. Ltd. and $4 million due to the acquisition of a majority interest in Cummins Central Power LLC (Central Power) in the third quarter of 2012. The increases were partially offset by a total decrease of $8 million at Cummins India Ltd. 39 Table of Contents Net Income Attributable to Cummins Inc. and Diluted Earnings Per Share Attributable to Cummins Inc. Net income and diluted earnings per share attributable to Cummins Inc. decreased primarily due to lower gross margin as a percentage of sales, mainly driven by unfavorable product mix and lower volumes, particularly in the Engine segment and Power Generation segment, a higher effective tax rate of 25.1 percent versus 23.5 percent in 2012, lower equity, royalty and interest income from investees, mainly due to the acquisition of the North American distributors, and higher selling, general and administrative expenses. These decreases were partially offset by lower research, development and engineering expenses. Diluted earnings per share for 2013 benefited $0.06 from lower shares outstanding, primarily due to purchases under the stock repurchase program. OPERATING SEGMENT RESULTS Our reportable operating segments, which consist of the Engine, Distribution, Components and Power Generation segments, use segment EBIT (defined as earnings before interest expense, taxes and noncontrolling interests) as a primary basis for the chief operating decision-maker to evaluate the performance of each of our operating segments. Segment amounts exclude certain expenses not specifically identifiable to segments. The accounting policies of our operating segments are the same as those applied in our Consolidated Financial Statements . We prepared the financial results of our operating segments on a basis that is consistent with the manner in which we internally disaggregate financial information to assist in making internal operating decisions. We have allocated certain common costs and expenses, primarily corporate functions, among segments differently than we would for stand-alone financial information prepared in accordance with accounting principles generally accepted in the United States of America (GAAP). These include certain costs and expenses of shared services, such as information technology, human resources, legal and finance. We also do not allocate debt-related items, actuarial gains or losses, prior service costs or credits, changes in cash surrender value of corporate owned life insurance or income taxes to individual segments. Segment EBIT may not be consistent with measures used by other companies. Following is a discussion of operating results for each of our business segments.

The following are the primary drivers by market: Heavy-duty truck engine sales increase d due to improved demand in the North American heavy-duty truck market with higher engine shipments of 29 percent. Medium-duty truck and bus sales increase d primarily due to market share gains in the North American medium-duty truck and bus markets, partially offset by weaker international demand. Light-duty automotive and RV sales increase d primarily due to a 9 percent increase in units shipped to Chrysler. The increases above were partially offset by unfavorable foreign currency fluctuations (primarily in Brazil and India). Total on-highway-related sales for 2014 were 65 percent of total engine segment sales, compared to 62 percent in 2013 . Segment EBIT Engine segment EBIT increase d versus 2013 , primarily due to higher gross margin and higher equity, royalty and interest income from investees, partially offset by higher selling, general and administrative expenses and higher research, development and engineering expenses. Major components of EBIT and related changes to segment EBIT and EBIT as a percentage of sales were as follows: Year ended December 31, 2014 vs. 2013 Favorable/(Unfavorable) Change In millions Amount Percent Percentage point change as a percent of sales Gross margin $ 274 13 % 0.6 Selling, general and administrative expenses (67 ) (8 )% 0.1 Research, development and engineering expenses (22 ) (5 )% 0.2 Equity, royalty and interest income from investees 11 8 % (0.1 ) 41 Table of Contents The increase in gross margin versus 2013 was primarily due to higher volumes, favorable mix, decreased material and commodity costs and improved pricing. The increase in selling, general and administrative expenses was primarily due to increased headcount and higher variable compensation expense. The increase in research, development and engineering expenses was primarily due to lower expense recovery, increased consulting, increased variable compensation and increased investment to support new product initiatives. The increase in equity, royalty and interest income from investees was primarily due to higher earnings at Beijing Foton Cummins Engine Co., Ltd. (Light-duty). 2013 vs. 2012 Sales Engine segment sales decreased versus 2012 due to lower demand in stationary power, heavy-duty truck and industrial businesses, partially offset by the medium-duty truck business. The following are the primary drivers by market: Stationary power engine sales decreased due to lower demand in power generation markets. Heavy-duty truck engine sales decreased due to weaker demand in North American on-highway markets during the first half of the year compared to the recovery experienced in the first half of 2012 as trucking companies replaced aging fleets. Industrial market sales decreased primarily due to a 36 percent reduction in global mining shipments as a result of lower commodity prices and a 37 percent decline in engine shipments to North American oil and gas markets, partially offset by increased shipments to the Western European construction markets as a result of the pre-buy activity in 2013 ahead of the Tier IV emission regulations beginning in the first quarter of 2014. Foreign currency fluctuations unfavorably impacted sales. The decreases above were partially offset by the following: Medium-duty truck engine sales increased due to market share gains in the North American medium-duty truck market and improved demand in the Brazilian and European truck markets. The improved sales in Brazil were primarily due to lower sales in the first half of 2012 as the result of the implementation of the Euro V emission regulations beginning in the first quarter of 2012. Total on-highway-related sales for 2013 were 62 percent of total engine segment sales, compared to 59 percent in 2012. Segment EBIT Engine segment EBIT decreased versus 2012, primarily due to lower gross margin, partially offset by lower research, development and engineering expenses and higher equity, royalty and interest income from investees. Engine segment EBIT for 2012 included restructuring and other charges of $20 million in the fourth quarter of 2012. Major components of EBIT and related changes to segment EBIT and EBIT as a percentage of sales were as follows: Year ended December 31, 2013 vs. 2012 Favorable/(Unfavorable) Change In millions Amount Percent Percentage point change as a percent of sales Gross margin $ (237 ) (10 )% (0.7 ) Selling, general and administrative expenses 1 % (0.5 ) Research, development and engineering expenses 17 4 % (0.2 ) Equity, royalty and interest income from investees 9 7 % 0.2 The decrease in gross margin versus 2012 was primarily due to unfavorable product mix and lower high-horsepower volumes, partially offset by improved price realization, decreased material and commodity costs and favorable foreign currency fluctuations. The decrease in selling, general and administrative expenses was primarily due to lower discretionary spending and the absence of restructuring charges incurred in 2012, partially offset by increased headcount. The decrease in research, development and engineering expenses was primarily due to lower discretionary spending in 2013, partially offset by increases in new product development spending and increased headcount to support our strategic growth initiatives. The increase in equity, royalty and interest income from investees was primarily due to higher earnings at Beijing Foton Cummins Engine Co., Ltd. within the light-duty business and Dongfeng Cummins Engine Company, Ltd., partially offset by lower earnings at Beijing Foton Engine Company, Ltd. (Heavy-duty) in anticipation of production in the second quarter of 2014. 42 Table of Contents Distribution Segment Results Financial data for the Distribution segment was as follows: Favorable/(Unfavorable) Years ended December 31, 2014 vs. 2013 2013 vs. 2012 In millions 2014 2013 2012 Amount Percent Amount Percent External sales $ 5,135 $ 3,726 $ 3,261 $ 1,409 38 % $ 465 14 % Intersegment sales 39 23 16 16 70 % 7 44 % Total sales 5,174 3,749 3,277 1,425 38 % 472 14 % Depreciation and amortization 86 54 34 (32 ) (59 )% (20 ) (59 )% Research, development and engineering expenses 9 6 6 (3 ) (50 )% % Equity, royalty and interest income from investees 148 165 188 (17 ) (10 )% (23 ) (12 )% Interest income 4 2 2 2 100 % % Segment EBIT (1) 491 388 369 103 27 % 19 5 % Percentage Points Percentage Points Segment EBIT as a percentage of total sales (2) 9.5 % 10.3 % 11.3 % (0.8 ) (1.0 ) _______________________________________________________________________________ (1) Segment EBIT for 2014 and 2013 included gains of $73 million and $12 million , respectively, resulting from acquisitions of controlling interests in North American distributors.

These increases were partially offset by unfavorable foreign currency fluctuations and decreased demand in India. Segment EBIT Distribution segment EBIT increase d versus 2013 , primarily due to the acquisitions of North American distributors, partially offset by unfavorable foreign currency fluctuations (primarily in Australia and Canada), higher selling, general and administrative expenses and lower equity, royalty and interest income from investees. The acquisitions resulted in gains of $73 million and $12 million for 2014 and 2013 , respectively, related to the remeasurement of our pre-existing ownership interests in accordance with GAAP, which were partially offset by $36 million and $14 million of amortization of intangible assets in 2014 and 2013 , respectively, for acquisitions since December 31, 2012. The decrease in equity, royalty and interest income from investees was the result of the acquisition of North American distributors since December 31, 2012 . Major components of EBIT and related changes to segment EBIT and EBIT as a percentage of sales were as follows: Year ended December 31, 2014 vs. 2013 Favorable/(Unfavorable) Change In millions Amount Percent Percentage point change as a percent of sales Gross margin $ 208 31 % (0.9 ) Selling, general and administrative expenses (144 ) (32 )% 0.6 Equity, royalty and interest income from investees (17 ) (10 )% (1.5 ) 2013 vs. 2012 Sales Distribution segment sales increased versus 2012 primarily due to $507 million of incremental sales in 2013 related to the acquisition of partially-owned North American distributors since June 2012. These increases were partially offset by decreased engine product sales, primarily due to a significant slowdown in the North American oil and gas markets, and by unfavorable foreign currency fluctuations. Excluding acquisition related sales, all other changes were relatively flat versus 2012. Segment EBIT Distribution segment EBIT increased versus 2012, primarily due to higher gross margin as a result of the acquisition and consolidation of partially owned North American distributors in 2013. This increase was partially offset by unfavorable foreign currency fluctuations, higher selling, general and administrative expenses and lower equity, royalty and interest income from investees as a result of the acquisitions. Amortization of intangible assets related to these acquisitions also negatively impacted EBIT for 2013. These acquisitions resulted in a $12 million gain related to the remeasurement of our pre-existing ownership interest in 2013, compared to a $7 million gain related to the remeasurement of our pre-existing 35 percent ownership in Central Power in 2012. Distribution segment EBIT also included restructuring and other charges of $14 million in 2012.

The following were the primary drivers by business: Emission solutions business sales increase d primarily due to improved demand in the North American on-highway markets and increased demand for our products in Europe and China to meet new emission requirements. The increases were partially offset by lower demand in Brazil. Turbo technologies business sales increase d as a result of improved on-highway demand in North America and Europe, partially offset by lower demand in Brazil. Fuel systems business sales increase d due to improved demand in the North American on-highway markets, the new Beijing Foton ISG engine that went into production during the second quarter of 2014 in China and increased aftermarket demand. The increases above were partially offset by unfavorable foreign currency fluctuations primarily in Brazil and South Africa, partially offset by Europe. Segment EBIT Components segment EBIT increase d versus 2013 , primarily due to higher gross margin and higher equity, royalty and interest income from investees, partially offset by higher selling, general and administrative expenses and higher research, development and engineering expenses.

The increase in selling, general and administrative expenses was primarily due to higher headcount to support business growth. The increase in research, development and engineering expenses was primarily due to higher headcount to support our strategic growth initiatives, partially offset by increased expense recovery. 2013 vs. 2012 Sales Components segment sales increased versus 2012 primarily due to increased sales within the emission solutions business, mainly related to the following: Improved on-highway OEM and aftermarket demand in North America. The impact of our 2012 acquisition of Hilite experienced in Western Europe, which resulted in $77 million of related incremental sales in 2013 compared to 2012. Western European pre-buy activity in anticipation of the Euro VI emission standards beginning in the first quarter of 2014. Growth in the medium-duty Brazilian truck market which resulted in improved aftertreatment demand. The increases above were partially offset by the following: Foreign currency fluctuations unfavorably impacted sales results. Fuel systems business sales decreased primarily due to lower demand in North American on-highway markets and lower demand in Europe, partially offset by increased aftermarket demand. Segment EBIT Components segment EBIT increased versus 2012, primarily due to higher gross margin. Components segment EBIT for 2012 included restructuring and other charges of $6 million in the fourth quarter. Major components of EBIT and related changes to segment EBIT and EBIT as a percentage of sales were as follows: Year ended December 31, 2013 vs. 2012 Favorable/(Unfavorable) Change In millions Amount Percent Percentage point change as a percent of sales Gross margin $ 112 13 % 0.9 Selling, general and administrative expenses 7 3 % 0.7 Research, development and engineering expenses (5 ) (2 )% 0.3 Equity, royalty and interest income from investees (1 ) (3 )% (0.1 ) The increase in gross margin was primarily due to higher volumes in the emission solutions business and lower material and commodity costs in several businesses, partially offset by increased warranty costs and unfavorable foreign currency fluctuations.

The following are the primary drivers by business: Power products sales decrease d primarily due to lower demand in North America driven by declining military sales and lower demand in India, Mexico and Russia, partially offset by increases in China, Africa and Western Europe. Alternators sales decrease d due to lower demand in Western Europe, India and Asia, partially offset by increased demand in the U.K. and China. Power systems sales decrease d primarily due to reduced demand in North America and Western Europe, partially offset by higher demand in Latin America and Brazil. Foreign currency fluctuations unfavorably impacted sales (primarily in India and Brazil). Operating Actions Power Generation took multiple actions in the fourth quarter of 2014 to reduce its future cost structure. Costs associated with these actions were $32 million and are primarily related to the closure of a plant in Germany. We also initiated other targeted actions throughout the business including various headcount reductions to better align capacity with the current levels of demand. These actions resulted in a Power Generation headcount reduction of approximately 250 employees and unfavorable impacts to gross margin of $22 million, selling, general and administrative expense of $6 million and research and development expenses of $4 million. The majority of these costs were accrued as of December 31, 2014 , and will be paid in 2015. 47 Table of Contents Segment EBIT Power Generation segment EBIT decrease d versus 2013 , primarily due to lower gross margin, higher selling, general and administrative expenses and higher research, development and engineering expenses, partially offset by higher equity, royalty and interest income from investees.

As of December 31, 2014 , other sources of liquidity included: cash and cash equivalents of $2.3 billion , of which approximately 41 percent was located in the U.S. and 59 percent was located outside the U.S., primarily in the U.K., China, Singapore and Belgium, revolving credit facility with $1.73 billion available, net of letters of credit, international and other domestic short-term credit facilities with $261 million available and marketable securities of $93 million , of which 65 percent is located in India, 29 percent is located in the U.S., and 6 percent is located in Brazil and the majority of which could be liquidated into cash within a few days. Our revolving credit agreement provides us with a $1.75 billion unsecured revolving credit facility, the proceeds of which are to be used for our general corporate purposes. In the fourth quarter of 2014, we exercised our option to extend the maturity date of our revolving credit agreement by one year from November 9, 2017, to November 9, 2018. See Note 9 , " DEBT ," to our Consolidated Financial Statements for further information. The credit agreement includes one financial covenant: a leverage ratio. The required leverage ratio, which measures the sum of total debt plus securitization financing to consolidated earnings before interest, taxes, depreciation and amortization (EBITDA) for the four fiscal quarters may not exceed 3.25 to 1.0. At December 31, 2014 , our leverage ratio was 0.6 to 1.0. We have a current shelf registration filed with the Securities and Exchange Commission under which we may offer, from time to time, debt securities, common stock, preferred and preference stock, depositary shares, warrants, stock purchase contracts and stock purchase units. We believe our liquidity provides us with the financial flexibility needed to fund working capital, common stock repurchases, capital expenditures, dividend payments, acquisitions of our North American distributors, projected pension obligations and debt service obligations. We continue to generate cash from operations in the U.S. and maintain access to $1.7 billion of our revolver as noted above. A significant portion of our cash flow is generated outside the U.S. As of December 31, 2014 , the total of cash, cash equivalents and marketable securities held by foreign subsidiaries was $1.4 billion , the vast majority of which was located in the U.K., China, Singapore, Belgium and India. The geographic location of our cash and marketable securities aligns well with our business growth strategy. We manage our worldwide cash requirements considering available funds among the many subsidiaries through which we conduct our business and the cost effectiveness with which those funds can be accessed. As a result, we do not anticipate any local liquidity restrictions to preclude us from funding our targeted expansion or operating needs with local resources. If we distribute our foreign cash balances to the U.S. or to other foreign subsidiaries, we could be required to accrue and pay U.S. taxes. For example, we would be required to accrue and pay additional U.S. taxes if we repatriated cash from certain foreign subsidiaries whose earnings we have asserted are permanently reinvested outside of the U.S. Foreign earnings for which we assert permanent reinvestment outside the U.S. consist primarily of earnings of our China and U.K. domiciled subsidiaries. At present, we do not foresee a need to repatriate any earnings from these subsidiaries for which we have asserted permanent reinvestment. However, to help fund cash needs of the U.S. or other international subsidiaries as they arise, we repatriate available cash from certain foreign subsidiaries whose earnings are not permanently reinvested when it is cost effective to do so. Earnings generated after 2011 from our China operations are considered permanently reinvested, while earnings generated prior to 2012, for which U.S. deferred tax liabilities have been recorded, are expected to be repatriated in future years . The maturity schedule of our existing long-term debt does not require significant cash outflows in the intermediate term. Required annual principal payments range from $11 million to $28 million over each of the next five years. 50 Table of Contents Working Capital Summary We fund our working capital with cash from operations and short-term borrowings when necessary. Various assets and liabilities, including short-term debt, can fluctuate significantly from month to month depending on short-term liquidity needs. As a result, working capital is a prime focus of management attention.

The increase s were partially offset by a decrease in cash and marketable securities, primarily due to lower proceeds from borrowings and $670 million of share repurchases in 2014 . Current liabilities increase d 19 percent compared to 2013 , primarily due to an increase in trade accounts payable and an increase in other accrued expenses. Inventory turnover decrease d 0.1 turns compared to 2013 . The decrease was primarily due to higher inventory balances related to the consolidation of six North American distributors in 2014 , which added $379 million of inventory at December 31, 2014 . Cash Flows Cash and cash equivalents decrease d $398 million during 2014 , compared to an increase of $1,330 million during the comparable period in 2013 . The changes impacting cash and cash equivalents were as follows: 51 Table of Contents Operating Activities Years ended December 31, Change In millions 2014 2013 2012 2014 vs. 2013 2013 vs. 2012 Consolidated net income $ 1,736 $ 1,588 $ 1,738 $ 148 $ (150 ) Depreciation and amortization 455 407 361 48 46 Gain on fair value adjustment for consolidated investees (73 ) (12 ) (7 ) (61 ) (5 ) Deferred income taxes 31 100 116 (69 ) (16 ) Equity in income of investees, net of dividends (100 ) (62 ) (15 ) (38 ) (47 ) Pension contributions in excess of expense (148 ) (82 ) (68 ) (66 ) (14 ) Other post-retirement benefits payments in excess of expense (27 ) (25 ) (21 ) (2 ) (4 ) Stock-based compensation expense 36 37 36 (1 ) 1 Translation and hedging activities (13 ) 17 (30 ) 17 Changes in current assets and liabilities, net of acquisitions Accounts and notes receivable (89 ) (148 ) 87 59 (235 ) Inventories (256 ) (46 ) (32 ) (210 ) (14 ) Other current assets 1 212 (60 ) (211 ) 272 Accounts payable 244 163 (256 ) 81 419 Accrued expenses 168 (246 ) (514 ) 414 268 Changes in other liabilities and deferred revenue 282 211 214 71 (3 ) Other, net 19 (25 ) (47 ) 44 22 Net cash provided by operating activites $ 2,266 $ 2,089 $ 1,532 $ 177 $ 557 2014 vs. 2013 Net cash provided by operating activities increase d versus 2013 primarily due to higher consolidated net income and favorable working capital fluctuations, partially offset by unfavorable deferred income taxes and higher pension contributions in excess of expense. During 2014 , the lower working capital resulted in a cash inflow of $68 million compared to a cash outflow of $65 million in 2013 . This change of $133 million was primarily driven by an increase in accrued expenses and accounts payable, partially offset by an increase in other current assets and inventories in 2014 , versus the comparable period in 2013 . The increase in accrued expenses was primarily due to higher income taxes payable, while the change in other current assets was largely due to the receipt of an income tax refund in 2013 . Pensions The funded status of our pension plans is dependent upon a variety of variables and assumptions including return on invested assets, market interest rates and levels of voluntary contributions to the plans. In 2014 , the investment return on our U.S. pension trust was 13.3 percent while our U.K. pension trust return was 16.8 percent. Approximately 78 percent of our pension plan assets are held in highly liquid investments such as fixed income and equity securities. The remaining 22 percent of our plan assets are held in less liquid, but market valued investments, including real estate, private equity and insurance contracts. We made $205 million of pension contributions in 2014 , including $111 million of voluntary contributions. Claims and premiums for other postretirement benefits approximated $45 million , net of reimbursements, in 2014 . These contributions and payments include transfers from our funds either to increase pension plan assets or to make direct payments to plan participants. We anticipate making total contributions of $175 million to our defined benefit pension plans in 2015 . Expected contributions to our defined benefit pension plans in 2015 will meet or exceed the current funding requirements. 2013 vs. 2012 Net cash provided by operating activities increased versus 2012 primarily due to favorable working capital fluctuations, partially offset by lower consolidated net income and lower dividends received from equity investees. During 2013, the net increase in working capital resulted in a cash outflow of $65 million compared to a cash outflow of $775 million in 2012. This change of $710 million was primarily driven by an increase in accounts payable due to timing differences, lower net tax payments of $311 million due to the receipt of income tax refunds in 2013, which were partially offset by tax payments, and a smaller decrease in accrued expenses, partially offset by an increase in accounts and notes receivable in 2013 as a result of higher sales in the fourth quarter of 2013 versus 2012. 52 Table of Contents Investing Activities Years ended December 31, Change In millions 2014 2013 2012 2014 vs. 2013 2013 vs. 2012 Capital expenditures $ (743 ) $ (676 ) $ (690 ) $ (67 ) $ 14 Investments in internal use software (55 ) (64 ) (87 ) 9 23 Investments in and advances to equity investees (60 ) (42 ) (70 ) (18 ) 28 Acquisitions of businesses, net of cash acquired (436 ) (147 ) (215 ) (289 ) 68 Investments in marketable securities acquisitions (275 ) (418 ) (561 ) 143 143 Investments in marketable securities liquidations 336 525 585 (189 ) (60 ) Purchases of other investments (40 ) 40 (40 ) Cash flows from derivatives not designated as hedges (14 ) 1 12 (15 ) (11 ) Other, net 13 15 44 (2 ) (29 ) Net cash used in investing activities $ (1,234 ) $ (846 ) $ (982 ) $ (388 ) $ 136 2014 vs. 2013 Net cash used in investing activities increase d versus 2013 primarily due to higher cash investment for the acquisition of businesses in 2014 and higher capital expenditures, partially offset by reduced purchases of corporate owned life insurance. In 2014 , we spent $436 million , net of cash acquired, on acquisitions of businesses in the Distribution segment. We plan to spend an additional $170 million to $210 million on North American distributor acquisitions and related debt retirements in 2015. Capital expenditures were $743 million in 2014 compared to $676 million in 2013 . Despite the challenging international economies, we continue to invest in new product lines and targeted capacity expansions. We plan to spend between $750 million and $850 million in 2015 as we continue with product launches, facility improvements and prepare for future emission standards. Approximately 50 percent of our capital expenditures are expected to be invested outside of the U.S. in 2015. 2013 vs. 2012 Net cash used in investing activities decreased versus 2012 primarily due to lower net investments in marketable securities, lower cash investments in acquisitions of businesses and lower investments in and advances to equity investees, partially offset by purchases of corporate owned life insurance.

In September 2013, we issued $1 billion aggregate principal amount of senior notes consisting of $500 million aggregate principal amount of 3.65% senior unsecured notes due in 2023 and $500 million aggregate principal amount of 4.875% senior unsecured notes due in 2043. Net proceeds from the issuance were $979 million. Our total debt was $1.7 billion at December 31, 2014 , compared with $1.7 billion at December 31, 2013 . Total debt as a percent of our total capital (total capital defined as debt plus equity) was 17.3 percent at December 31, 2014 , compared with 18.1 percent at December 31, 2013 . 53 Table of Contents 2013 vs. 2012 Net cash provided by financing activities increased versus 2012 primarily due to proceeds from the issuance of senior notes and lower payments on borrowings and capital lease obligations, partially offset by higher repurchases of common stock and higher dividend payments. Our total debt was $1.7 billion as of December 31, 2013, compared with $775 million as of December 31, 2012. Total debt as a percent of our total capital was 18.1 percent at December 31, 2013, compared with 10.0 percent at December 31, 2012. Repurchase of Common Stock We repurchased $670 million of common stock under the 2012 Board of Directors authorized plan during 2014 . Quarterly purchases were as follows: In millions (except per share amounts) For each quarter ended Shares Purchased Average Cost Per Share Total Cost of Repurchases Remaining Authorized Capacity (1) March 30 3.0 $ 139.70 $ 419 $ 425 June 29 0.1 148.11 11 415 September 28 1.2 139.76 175 240 December 31 0.5 132.66 65 174 Total 4.8 $ 139.12 $ 670 $ 174 ___________________________________________________________ (1) The remaining authorized capacity is calculated based on the cost to purchase the shares, but excludes commission expenses according to the Board of Directors authorization. In July 2014, our Board of Directors authorized the acquisition of up to $1 billion of additional common stock upon the completion of the 2012 repurchase plan. Quarterly Dividends Total dividends paid to common shareholders in 2014 , 2013 and 2012 were $512 million , $420 million and $340 million respectively. Declaration and payment of dividends in the future depends upon our income and liquidity position, among other factors, and is subject to declaration by our Board of Directors, who meet quarterly to consider our dividend payment. We expect to fund dividend payments with cash from operations. In July 2014, the Board of Directors authorized a dividend increase of approximately 25 percent from $0.625 per share to $0.78 per share on a quarterly basis. In July 2013, the Board of Directors authorized a 25 percent increase to our quarterly cash dividend on our common stock from $0.50 per share to $0.625 per share. In July 2012, the Board of Directors authorized a 25 percent increase to our quarterly cash dividend on our common stock from $0.40 per share to $0.50 per share. Cash dividends per share paid to common shareholders for the last three years were as follows: Quarterly Dividends 2014 2013 2012 First quarter $ 0.625 $ 0.50 $ 0.40 Second quarter 0.625 0.50 0.40 Third quarter 0.78 0.625 0.50 Fourth quarter 0.78 0.625 0.50 Total $ 2.81 $ 2.25 $ 1.80 Credit Ratings A number of our contractual obligations and financing agreements, such as our revolving credit facility, have restrictive covenants and/or pricing modifications that may be triggered in the event of downward revisions to our corporate credit rating. There were no downgrades of our credit ratings in 2014 that have impacted these covenants or pricing modifications. In December 2014, Moody's Investors Service, Inc. raised our rating to 'A2' and confirmed our outlook as stable. In October 2014, Fitch Ratings reaffirmed our rating and outlook. In August 2014, Standard & Poor's Ratings Services raised our rating to 'A+' and confirmed our outlook as stable. 54 Table of Contents Credit ratings are not recommendations to buy, are subject to change and each rating should be evaluated independently of any other rating.

Our Consolidated Financial Statements are prepared in accordance with GAAP which often requires management to make judgments, estimates and assumptions regarding uncertainties that affect the reported amounts presented and disclosed in the financial statements. Management reviews these estimates and assumptions based on historical experience, changes in business conditions and other relevant factors they believe to be reasonable under the circumstances. In any given reporting period, our actual results may differ from the estimates and assumptions used in preparing our Consolidated Financial Statements. 55 Table of Contents Critical accounting estimates are defined as follows: the estimate requires management to make assumptions about matters that were highly uncertain at the time the estimate was made; different estimates reasonably could have been used; or if changes in the estimate are reasonably likely to occur from period to period and the change would have a material impact on our financial condition or results of operations. Our senior management has discussed the development and selection of our accounting policies, related accounting estimates and the disclosures set forth below with the Audit Committee of our Board of Directors. We believe our critical accounting estimates include those addressing the estimation of liabilities for warranty programs, accounting for income taxes and pension benefits. Warranty Programs We estimate and record a liability for base warranty programs at the time our products are sold. Our estimates are based on historical experience and reflect management's best estimates of expected costs at the time products are sold and subsequent adjustment to those expected costs when actual costs differ. As a result of the uncertainty surrounding the nature and frequency of product recall programs, the liability for such programs is recorded when we commit to a recall action or when a recall becomes probable and estimable, which generally occurs when it is announced. Our warranty liability is generally affected by component failure rates, repair costs and the point of failure within the product life cycle. Future events and circumstances related to these factors could materially change our estimates and require adjustments to our liability. New product launches require a greater use of judgment in developing estimates until historical experience becomes available. Product specific experience is typically available four or five quarters after product launch, with a clear experience trend evident eight quarters after launch. We generally record warranty expense for new products upon shipment using a preceding product's warranty history and a multiplicative factor based upon preceding similar product experience and new product assessment until sufficient new product data is available for warranty estimation. We then use a blend of actual new product experience and preceding product historical experience for several subsequent quarters, and new product specific experience thereafter. Note 10 , " PRODUCT WARRANTY LIABILITY ," to our Consolidated Financial Statements contains a summary of the activity in our warranty liability account for 2014 and 2013 including adjustments to pre-existing warranties. Accounting for Income Taxes We determine our income tax expense using the asset and liability method. Under this method, deferred tax assets and liabilities are recognized for the future tax effects of temporary differences between the financial statement carrying amounts of existing assets and liabilities and their respective tax bases. Future tax benefits of tax loss and credit carryforwards are also recognized as deferred tax assets. We evaluate the recoverability of our deferred tax assets each quarter by assessing the likelihood of future profitability and available tax planning strategies that could be implemented to realize our net deferred tax assets. At December 31, 2014 , we recorded net deferred tax assets of $184 million . These assets included $190 million for the value of tax loss and credit carryforwards. A valuation allowance of $144 million was recorded to reduce the tax assets to the net value management believed was more likely than not to be realized. In the event our operating performance deteriorates, future assessments could conclude that a larger valuation allowance will be needed to further reduce the deferred tax assets. In addition, we operate within multiple taxing jurisdictions and are subject to tax audits in these jurisdictions. These audits can involve complex issues, which may require an extended period of time to resolve. We accrue for the estimated additional tax and interest that may result from tax authorities disputing uncertain tax positions we have taken and we believe we have made adequate provision for income taxes for all years that are subject to audit based upon the latest information available. A more complete description of our income taxes and the future benefits of our tax loss and credit carryforwards is disclosed in Note 4 , " INCOME TAXES ," to our Consolidated Financial Statements . Pension Benefits We sponsor a number of pension plans primarily in the U.S. and the U.K. and to a lesser degree in various other countries. In the U.S. and the U.K. we have several major defined benefit plans that are separately funded. We account for our pension programs in accordance with employers' accounting for defined benefit pension and other postretirement plans under GAAP. GAAP requires that amounts recognized in financial statements be determined using an actuarial basis. As a result, our pension benefit programs are based on a number of statistical and judgmental assumptions that attempt to anticipate future events and are used in calculating the expense and liability related to our plans each year at December 31. These assumptions include discount rates used to value liabilities, assumed rates of return on plan assets, future compensation increases, employee turnover rates, actuarial assumptions relating to retirement age, mortality rates and participant withdrawals. The actuarial assumptions we use may differ significantly from actual results due to changing economic conditions, participant life span and withdrawal rates. These differences may result in a material impact to the amount of net periodic pension cost to be recorded in our Consolidated Financial Statements in the future. 56 Table of Contents The expected long-term return on plan assets is used in calculating the net periodic pension cost. We considered several factors in developing our expected rate of return on plan assets. The long-term rate of return considers historical returns and expected returns on current and projected asset allocations and is generally applied to a five-year average market value of return. Projected returns are based primarily on broad, publicly traded fixed income and equity indices and forward-looking estimates of active portfolio and investment management. As of December 31, 2014, based upon our target asset allocations, it is anticipated that our U.S. investment policy will generate an average annual return over the 10-year projection period equal to or in excess of 7.5 percent approximately 20 percent of the time while returns of 8.0 percent or greater are anticipated 15 percent of the time. We expect additional positive returns from active investment management. The 2014 one-year return of 13.3 percent , combined with the very favorable returns since 2010, has resulted in approximately $470 million of actuarial gains in accumulated other comprehensive income over the past five years. Based on the historical returns and forward-looking return expectations, we believe an investment return assumption of 7.5 percent per year in 2015 for U.S. pension assets is reasonable. The methodology used to determine the rate of return on pension plan assets in the U.K. was based on establishing an equity-risk premium over current long-term bond yields adjusted based on target asset allocations. As of December 31, 2014, based upon our target asset allocations, it is anticipated that our U.K. investment policy will generate an average annual return over the 20-year projection period equal to or in excess of 5.2 percent approximately 50 percent of the time while returns of 6.1 percent or greater are anticipated 25 percent of the time. We expect additional positive returns from active investment management. The one-year return for our U.K. plan was 16.8 percent for 2014 , and similar to our U.S. plan, the strong returns over the past five years have resulted in approximately $285 million of actuarial gains in accumulated other comprehensive income. Our strategy with respect to our investments in pension plan assets is to be invested with a long-term outlook. Therefore, the risk and return balance of our asset portfolio should reflect a long-term horizon. Based on the historical returns and forward-looking return expectations, we believe an investment return assumption of 5.8 percent in 2015 for U.K. pension assets is reasonable. Our pension plan asset allocations at December 31, 2014 and 2013 and target allocation for 2015 are as follows: U.S. Plans U.K. Plans Target Allocation Percentage of Plan Assets at December 31, Target Allocation Percentage of Plan Assets at December 31, Investment description 2015 2014 2013 2015 2014 2013 Fixed income 64.0 % 65.7 % 57.4 % 50.0 % 56.0 % 46.9 % Equity securities 22.0 % 22.9 % 30.5 % 25.5 % 32.0 % 39.5 % Real estate/other 14.0 % 11.4 % 12.1 % 24.5 % 12.0 % 13.6 % Total 100.0 % 100.0 % 100.0 % 100.0 % 100.0 % 100.0 % The differences between the actual return on plan assets and expected long-term return on plan assets are recognized in the asset value used to calculate net periodic cost over five years. The table below sets forth the expected return assumptions used to develop our pension cost for the period 2012 - 2014 and our expected rate of return for 2015 . Long-term Expected Return Assumptions 2015 2014 2013 2012 U.S. plans 7.50 % 7.50 % 8.00 % 8.00 % U.K. plans 5.80 % 5.80 % 5.80 % 6.50 % A lower expected rate of return will increase our net periodic pension cost and reduce profitability. GAAP for pensions offers various acceptable alternatives to account for the differences that eventually arise between the estimates used in the actuarial valuations and the actual results. It is acceptable to delay or immediately recognize these differences. Under the delayed recognition alternative, changes in pension obligation (including those resulting from plan amendments) and changes in the value of assets set aside to meet those obligations are not recognized in net periodic pension cost as they occur but are recognized initially in comprehensive income and subsequently amortized as components of net periodic pension cost systematically and gradually over future periods. In addition to this approach, GAAP also allows immediate recognition of actuarial gains or losses. Immediate recognition introduces volatility in financial results. We have chosen to delay recognition and amortize actuarial differences over future periods. If we adopted the immediate recognition approach, we would record a loss of $897 million ($614 million after-tax) from cumulative actuarial net losses for our U.S. and U.K. pension plans. 57 Table of Contents The difference between the expected return and the actual return on plan assets is deferred from recognition in our results of operations and, under certain circumstances such as when the difference exceeds 10 percent of the market value of plan assets or the projected benefit obligation (PBO), amortized over future years of service. This is also true of changes to actuarial assumptions. As of December 31, 2014 , we had net pension actuarial losses of $611 million and $286 million for the U.S. and U.K. pension plans, respectively. Under GAAP, the actuarial gains and losses are recognized and recorded in accumulated other comprehensive loss. Net actuarial losses decreased our shareholders' equity by $78 million (after-tax) in 2014 . The losses were due to liability losses from lower U.S. and U.K. discount rates, partially offset by improved plan asset performance for both the U.S. and U.K. plans. As these amounts exceed 10 percent of our PBO, the excess is amortized over the average remaining service lives of participating employees. The table below sets forth the net periodic pension cost for the period 2012 - 2014 and our expected cost for 2015 . In millions 2015 2014 2013 2012 Net periodic pension cost $ 58 $ 57 $ 87 $ 64 We expect 2015 net periodic pension cost to remain flat when compared to 2014 , due to lower discount rates in the U.S. and U.K. and unfavorable mortality demographics in the U.S., offset by favorable expected return on asset performance in both the U.S. and U.K. The decrease in periodic pension cost in 2014 compared to 2013 was due to reduced loss amortizations resulting from improved U.S. asset performance and a higher discount rate. The increase in periodic pension cost in 2013 compared to 2012 was due to unfavorable impacts of higher service cost due to increased headcount, decreased discount rates and lower expected asset returns for our U.K. plan as we de-risk plan trust assets moving toward more conservative investments. Another key assumption used in the development of the net periodic pension cost is the discount rate. The weighted average discount rates used to develop our net periodic pension cost are set forth in the table below. Discount Rates 2015 2014 2013 2012 U.S. plans 4.07 % 4.83 % 3.97 % 4.82 % U.K. plans 3.80 % 4.60 % 4.70 % 5.20 % Changes in the discount rate assumptions will impact the interest cost component of the net periodic pension cost calculation. The discount rate enables us to state expected future cash payments for benefits as a present value on the measurement date. The guidelines for setting this rate are discussed in GAAP which suggests the use of a high-quality corporate bond rate. We used bond information provided by Moody's Investor Services, Inc. and Standard & Poor's Rating Services. All bonds used to develop our hypothetical portfolio in the U.S. and U.K. were deemed high-quality, non-callable bonds (Aa or better) as of December 31, 2014 , by at least one of the bond rating agencies. The average yield of this hypothetical bond portfolio was used as the benchmark for determining the discount rate to be used to value the obligations of the plans subject to GAAP for pensions and other postretirement benefits. Our model called for projected payments until near extinction for the U.S. and the U.K. For both countries, our model matches the present value of the plan's projected benefit payments to the market value of the theoretical settlement bond portfolio. A single equivalent discount rate is determined to align the present value of the required cash flow with the value of the bond portfolio. The resulting discount rate is reflective of both the current interest rate environment and the plan's distinct liability characteristics. The table below sets forth the estimated impact on our 2015 net periodic pension cost relative to a change in the discount rate and a change in the expected rate of return on plan assets. In millions Impact on Pension Cost Increase/(Decrease) Discount rate used to value liabilities 0.25 percent increase $ (13 ) 0.25 percent decrease 13 Expected rate of return on assets 1 percent increase (41 ) 1 percent decrease 41 58 Table of Contents The above sensitivities reflect the impact of changing one assumption at a time. A higher discount rate decreases the plan obligations and decreases our net periodic pension cost. A lower discount rate increases the plan obligations and increases our net periodic pension cost. It should be noted that economic factors and conditions often affect multiple assumptions simultaneously and the effects of changes in key assumptions are not necessarily linear. Note 11 , " PENSION AND OTHER POSTRETIREMENT BENEFITS ," to our Consolidated Financial Statements provides a summary of our pension benefit plan activity, the funded status of our plans and the amounts recognized in our Consolidated Financial Statements . RECENTLY ADOPTED AND RECENTLY ISSUED ACCOUNTING PRONOUNCEMENTS Accounting Pronouncements Recently Adopted In February 2013, the Financial Accounting Standards Board (FASB) amended its standards on comprehensive income by requiring disclosure in the footnotes of information about amounts reclassified out of accumulated other comprehensive income by component. Specifically, the amendment requires disclosure of the line items on net income in which the item was reclassified only if it is reclassified to net income in its entirety in the same reporting period. The new rules became effective for us beginning January 1, 2013 and were adopted prospectively in accordance with the standard. The standard resulted in new disclosures in NOTE 15 , " ACCUMULATED OTHER COMPREHENSIVE INCOME (LOSS) ." Accounting Pronouncements Issued But Not Yet Effective In May 2014, the FASB amended its standards related to revenue recognition. This amendment replaces all existing revenue recognition guidance and provides a single, comprehensive revenue recognition model for all contracts with customers. The standard contains principles that we will apply to determine the measurement of revenue and timing of when it is recognized. The underlying principle is that we will recognize revenue in a manner that depicts the transfer of goods or services to customers at an amount that we expect to be entitled to in exchange for those goods or services. The standard allows either full or modified retrospective adoption. Early adoption is not permitted. The guidance provides a five-step analysis of transactions to determine when and how revenue is recognized. Other major provisions include capitalization of certain contract costs, consideration of time value of money in the transaction price and allowing estimates of variable consideration to be recognized before contingencies are resolved in certain circumstances. The amendment also requires additional disclosure about the nature, amount, timing and uncertainty of revenue and cash flows arising from customer contracts, including significant judgments and changes in judgments and assets recognized from costs incurred to fulfill a contract. The new rules will become effective for annual and interim periods beginning January 1, 2017. We are in the process of evaluating the impact the amendment will have on our Consolidated Financial Statements , and we are further considering the impact of each method of adoption.
