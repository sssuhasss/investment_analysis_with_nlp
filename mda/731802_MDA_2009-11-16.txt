ITEM 7. Management Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations. INTRODUCTION This section provides management discussion of the financial condition, changes in financial condition and results of operations of Atmos Energy Corporation and its consolidated subsidiaries with specific information on results of operations and liquidity and capital resources. It includes management interpretation of our financial results, the factors affecting these results, the major factors expected to affect future operating results and future investment and financing plans. This discussion should be read in conjunction with our consolidated financial statements and notes thereto. Several factors exist that could influence our future financial performance, some of which are described in Item 1A above, Risk Factors . They should be considered in connection with evaluating forward-looking statements contained in this report or otherwise made by or on behalf of us since these factors could cause actual results and conditions to differ materially from those set out in such forward-looking statements. Cautionary Statement for the Purposes of the Safe Harbor under the Private Securities Litigation Reform Act of 1995 The statements contained in this Annual Report on Form 10-K may contain forward-looking statements within the meaning of Section 27A of the Securities Act of 1933 and Section 21E of the Securities Exchange Act of 1934. All statements other than statements of historical fact included in this Report are forward-looking statements made in good faith by us and are intended to qualify for the safe harbor from liability established by the Private Securities Litigation Reform Act of 1995. When used in this Report, or any other of our documents or oral presentations, the words anticipate , believe , estimate , expect , forecast , goal , intend , objective , plan , projection , seek , strategy or similar words are intended to identify forward-looking statements. Such forward-looking statements are subject to risks and uncertainties that could cause actual results to differ materially from those expressed or implied in the statements relating to our strategy, operations, markets, services, rates, recovery of costs, availability of gas supply and other factors. These risks and uncertainties include the following: our ability to continue to access the credit markets to satisfy our liquidity requirements; the impact of recent economic conditions on our customers; increased costs of providing pension and postretirement health care benefits and increased funding requirements; market risks beyond our control affecting our risk management activities including market liquidity, commodity price volatility, increasing interest rates and counterparty creditworthiness; regulatory trends and decisions, including the impact of rate proceedings before various state regulatory commissions; increased federal regulatory oversight and potential penalties; the impact of environmental regulations on our business; the possible impact of future additional regulatory and financial risks associated with global warming and climate change; the concentration of our distribution, pipeline and storage operations in Texas; adverse weather conditions; the effects of inflation and changes in the availability and price of natural gas; the capital-intensive nature of our gas distribution business; increased competition from energy suppliers and alternative forms of energy; the inherent hazards and risks involved in operating our gas distribution business, natural disasters, terrorist activities or other events, and other risks and uncertainties discussed herein, especially those discussed in Item 1A above, all of which are difficult to predict and many of which are beyond our control. Accordingly, while we believe these forward-looking statements to be reasonable, there can be no assurance that they will approximate actual experience or that the expectations derived from them will be realized. Further, we undertake no obligation to update or revise any of our forward-looking statements whether as a result of new information, future events or otherwise. CRITICAL ACCOUNTING POLICIES AND ESTIMATES Our consolidated financial statements were prepared in accordance with accounting principles generally accepted in the United States. Preparation of these financial statements requires us to make estimates and judgments that affect the reported amounts of assets, liabilities, revenues and expenses and the related disclosures of contingent assets and liabilities. We based our estimates on historical experience and various other assumptions that we believe to be reasonable under the circumstances. On an ongoing basis, we evaluate 35 Table of Contents our estimates, including those related to risk management and trading activities, fair value measurements, allowance for doubtful accounts, legal and environmental accruals, insurance accruals, pension and postretirement obligations, deferred income taxes and valuation of goodwill, indefinite-lived intangible assets and other long-lived assets. Our critical accounting policies are reviewed by the Audit Committee quarterly. Actual results may differ from estimates. Regulation Our natural gas distribution and regulated transmission and storage operations are subject to regulation with respect to rates, service, maintenance of accounting records and various other matters by the respective regulatory authorities in the states in which we operate. We meet the criteria established within accounting principles generally accepted in the United States of a cost-based, rate-regulated entity, which requires us to reflect the financial effects of the ratemaking and accounting practices and policies of the various regulatory commissions in our financial statements in accordance with applicable authoritative accounting standards. We apply the provisions of this standard to our regulated operations and record regulatory assets for costs that have been deferred for which future recovery through customer rates is considered probable and regulatory liabilities when it is probable that revenues will be reduced for amounts that will be credited to customers through the ratemaking process. As a result, certain costs that would normally be expensed under accounting principles generally accepted in the United States are permitted to be capitalized or deferred on the balance sheet because it is probable they can be recovered through rates. Discontinuing the application of this method of accounting for regulatory assets and liabilities could significantly increase our operating expenses as fewer costs would likely be capitalized or deferred on the balance sheet, which could reduce our net income. Further, regulation may impact the period in which revenues or expenses are recognized. The amounts to be recovered or recognized are based upon historical experience and our understanding of the regulations. The impact of regulation on our regulated operations may be affected by decisions of the regulatory authorities or the issuance of new regulations. Revenue recognition Sales of natural gas to our natural gas distribution customers are billed on a monthly basis; however, the billing cycle periods for certain classes of customers do not necessarily coincide with accounting periods used for financial reporting purposes. We follow the revenue accrual method of accounting for natural gas distribution segment revenues whereby revenues applicable to gas delivered to customers, but not yet billed under the cycle billing method, are estimated and accrued and the related costs are charged to expense. On occasion, we are permitted to implement new rates that have not been formally approved by our regulatory authorities, which are subject to refund. We recognize this revenue and establish a reserve for amounts that could be refunded based on our experience for the jurisdiction in which the rates were implemented. Rates established by regulatory authorities are adjusted for increases and decreases in our purchased gas costs through purchased gas cost adjustment mechanisms. Purchased gas cost adjustment mechanisms provide gas utility companies a method of recovering purchased gas costs on an ongoing basis without filing a rate case to address all of the utility company non-gas costs. These mechanisms are commonly utilized when regulatory authorities recognize a particular type of cost, such as purchased gas costs, that (i) is subject to significant price fluctuations compared to the utility company other costs, (ii) represents a large component of the utility company cost of service and (iii) is generally outside the control of the gas utility company. There is no gross profit generated through purchased gas cost adjustments, but they provide a dollar-for-dollar offset to increases or decreases in utility gas costs. Although substantially all natural gas distribution sales to our customers fluctuate with the cost of gas that we purchase, our gross profit is generally not affected by fluctuations in the cost of gas as a result of the purchased gas cost adjustment mechanism. The effects of these purchased gas cost adjustment mechanisms are recorded as deferred gas costs on our balance sheet. Operating revenues for our regulated transmission and storage and pipeline, storage and other segments are recognized in the period in which actual volumes are transported and storage services are provided. Operating revenues for our natural gas marketing segment and the associated carrying value of natural gas inventory (inclusive of storage costs) are recognized when we sell the gas and physically deliver it to our customers. Operating revenues include realized gains and losses arising from the settlement of financial 36 Table of Contents instruments used in our natural gas marketing activities and unrealized gains and losses arising from changes in the fair value of natural gas inventory designated as a hedged item in a fair value hedge and the associated financial instruments. Allowance for doubtful accounts Accounts receivable arise from natural gas sales to residential, commercial, industrial, municipal and other customers. For the majority of our receivables, we establish an allowance for doubtful accounts based on our collections experience. On certain other receivables where we are aware of a specific customer inability or reluctance to pay, we record an allowance for doubtful accounts against amounts due to reduce the net receivable balance to the amount we reasonably expect to collect. However, if circumstances change, our estimate of the recoverability of accounts receivable could be affected. Circumstances which could affect our estimates include, but are not limited to, customer credit issues, the level of natural gas prices, customer deposits and general economic conditions. Accounts are written off once they are deemed to be uncollectible. Financial instruments and hedging activities We currently use financial instruments to mitigate commodity price risk. Additionally, we periodically use financial instruments to manage interest rate risk. The objectives and strategies for using financial instruments have been tailored to meet the needs of our regulated and nonregulated businesses. We record all of our financial instruments on the balance sheet at fair value as required by accounting principles generally accepted in the United States , with changes in fair value ultimately recorded in the income statement. The timing of when changes in fair value of our financial instruments are recorded in the income statement depends on whether the financial instrument has been designated and qualifies as a part of a hedging relationship or if regulatory rulings require a different accounting treatment. Changes in fair value for financial instruments that do not meet one of these criteria are recognized in the income statement as they occur. Financial Instruments Associated with Commodity Price Risk In our natural gas distribution segment, our customers are exposed to the effect of volatile natural gas prices. We manage this exposure through a combination of physical storage, fixed-price forward contracts and financial instruments, primarily over-the-counter swap and option contracts, in an effort to minimize the impact of natural gas price volatility on our customers during the winter heating season. The costs associated with and the gains and losses arising from the use of financial instruments to mitigate commodity price risk in this segment are included in our purchased gas adjustment mechanisms in accordance with regulatory requirements. Therefore, changes in the fair value of these financial instruments are initially recorded as a component of deferred gas costs and recognized in the consolidated statement of income as a component of purchased gas cost when the related costs are recovered through our rates and recognized in revenue in accordance with accounting principles generally accepted in the United States. Accordingly, there is no earnings impact to our natural gas distribution segment as a result of the use of financial instruments. Our natural gas marketing segment aggregates and purchases gas supply, arranges transportation and/or storage logistics and ultimately delivers gas to our customers at competitive prices. We also perform asset optimization activities in both our natural gas marketing segment and pipeline, storage and other segment. As a result of these activities, our nonregulated operations are exposed to risks associated with changes in the market price of natural gas. We manage our exposure to the risk of natural gas price changes through a combination of physical storage and financial instruments, including futures, over-the-counter and exchange-traded options and swap contracts with counterparties. In our natural gas marketing and pipeline, storage and other segments, we have designated the natural gas inventory held by these operating segments as the hedged item in a fair-value hedge. This inventory is marked to market at the end of each month based on the Gas Daily index, with changes in fair value recognized as unrealized gains or losses in revenue in the period of change. The financial instruments associated with this natural gas inventory have been designated as fair-value hedges and are marked to market each month based upon the NYMEX price with changes in fair value recognized as unrealized gains or losses in revenue in the period of change. Changes in the spreads between the forward natural gas prices used to value the financial instruments designated against our physical inventory (NYMEX) and the market (spot) prices used to value 37 Table of Contents our physical storage (Gas Daily) result in unrealized margins until the underlying physical gas is withdrawn and the related financial instruments are settled. The difference in the spot price used to value our physical inventory and the forward price used to value the related financial instruments can result in volatility in our reported income as a component of unrealized margins. We have elected to exclude this spot/forward differential for purposes of assessing the effectiveness of these fair-value hedges. Once the gas is withdrawn and the financial instruments are settled, the previously unrealized margins associated with these net positions are realized. Over time, we expect gains and losses on the sale of storage gas inventory to be offset by gains and losses on the fair-value hedges, resulting in the realization of the economic gross profit margin we anticipated at the time we structured the original transaction. We have elected to treat fixed-price forward contracts used in our natural gas marketing segment to deliver gas as normal purchases and normal sales. As such, these deliveries are recorded on an accrual basis in accordance with our revenue recognition policy. Financial instruments used to mitigate the commodity price risk associated with these contracts have been designated as cash flow hedges of anticipated purchases and sales at indexed prices. Accordingly, unrealized gains and losses on open financial instruments are recorded as a component of accumulated other comprehensive income and are recognized in earnings as a component of revenue when the hedged volumes are sold. Hedge ineffectiveness, to the extent incurred, is reported as a component of revenue. We also use storage swaps and futures to capture additional storage arbitrage opportunities in our natural gas marketing segment that arise after the execution of the original fair value hedge associated with our physical natural gas inventory, basis swaps to insulate and protect the economic value of our fixed price and storage books and various over-the-counter and exchange-traded options. These financial instruments have not been designated as hedges. Financial Instruments Associated with Interest Rate Risk We periodically manage interest rate risk, typically when we issue new or refinance existing long-term debt. As of September 30, 2009, we had no financial instruments in place to manage interest rate risk. However, in prior years, we entered into Treasury lock agreements to fix the Treasury yield component of the interest cost associated with anticipated financings. We designated these Treasury lock agreements as a cash flow hedge of an anticipated transaction at the time the agreements were executed. Accordingly, unrealized gains and losses associated with the Treasury lock agreements were recorded as a component of accumulated other comprehensive income (loss). The realized gain or loss recognized upon settlement of each Treasury lock agreement was initially recorded as a component of accumulated other comprehensive income (loss) and is recognized as a component of interest expense over the life of the related financing arrangement. Impairment assessments We perform impairment assessments of our goodwill, intangible assets subject to amortization and long-lived assets. As of September 30, 2009, we had no indefinite-lived intangible assets. We annually evaluate our goodwill balances for impairment during our second fiscal quarter or as impairment indicators arise. We use a present value technique based on discounted cash flows to estimate the fair value of our reporting units. We have determined our reporting units to be each of our natural gas distribution divisions and wholly-owned subsidiaries and goodwill is allocated to the reporting units responsible for the acquisition that gave rise to the goodwill. The discounted cash flow calculations used to assess goodwill impairment are dependent on several subjective factors including the timing of future cash flows, future growth rates and the discount rate. An impairment charge is recognized if the carrying value of a reporting unit goodwill exceeds its fair value. We annually assess whether the cost of our intangible assets subject to amortization or other long-lived assets is recoverable or that the remaining useful lives may warrant revision. We perform this assessment more frequently when specific events or circumstances have occurred that suggest the recoverability of the cost of the intangible and other long-lived assets is at risk. When such events or circumstances are present, we assess the recoverability of these assets by determining whether the carrying value will be recovered through expected future cash flows from the 38 Table of Contents operating division or subsidiary to which these assets relate. These cash flow projections consider various factors such as the timing of the future cash flows and the discount rate and are based upon the best information available at the time the estimate is made. Changes in these factors could materially affect the cash flow projections and result in the recognition of an impairment charge. An impairment charge is recognized as the difference between the carrying amount and the fair value if the sum of the undiscounted cash flows is less than the carrying value of the related asset. Pension and other postretirement plans Pension and other postretirement plan costs and liabilities are determined on an actuarial basis and are affected by numerous assumptions and estimates including the market value of plan assets, estimates of the expected return on plan assets, assumed discount rates and current demographic and actuarial mortality data. Prior to fiscal 2009, we reviewed the estimates and assumptions underlying our pension and other postretirement plan costs and liabilities annually based upon a June 30 measurement date. Effective October 1, 2008, we changed our measurement date to September 30. The assumed discount rate and the expected return are the assumptions that generally have the most significant impact on our pension costs and liabilities. The assumed discount rate, the assumed health care cost trend rate and assumed rates of retirement generally have the most significant impact on our postretirement plan costs and liabilities. The discount rate is utilized principally in calculating the actuarial present value of our pension and postretirement obligations and net pension and postretirement costs. When establishing our discount rate, we consider high quality corporate bond rates, changes in those rates from the prior year and the implied discount rate that is derived from matching our projected benefit disbursements with a high quality corporate bond spot rate curve. The expected long-term rate of return on assets is utilized in calculating the expected return on plan assets component of our annual pension and postretirement plan costs. We estimate the expected return on plan assets by evaluating expected bond returns, equity risk premiums, asset allocations, the effects of active plan management, the impact of periodic plan asset rebalancing and historical performance. We also consider the guidance from our investment advisors in making a final determination of our expected rate of return on assets. To the extent the actual rate of return on assets realized over the course of a year is greater than or less than the assumed rate, that year annual pension or postretirement plan costs are not affected. Rather, this gain or loss reduces or increases future pension or postretirement plan costs over a period of approximately ten to twelve years. We estimate the assumed health care cost trend rate used in determining our postretirement net expense based upon our actual health care cost experience, the effects of recently enacted legislation and general economic conditions. Our assumed rate of retirement is estimated based upon our annual review of our participant census information as of the measurement date. Actual changes in the fair market value of plan assets and differences between the actual return on plan assets and the expected return on plan assets could have a material effect on the amount of pension costs ultimately recognized. A 0.25 percent change in our discount rate would impact our pension and postretirement costs by approximately $0.8 million. A 0.25 percent change in our expected rate of return would impact our pension and postretirement costs by approximately $0.9 million. Fair Value Measurements We report certain assets and liabilities at fair value, which is defined as the price that would be received to sell an asset or paid to transfer a liability in an orderly transaction between market participants at the measurement date (exit price). We primarily use quoted market prices and other observable market pricing information in valuing our financial assets and liabilities and minimize the use of unobservable pricing inputs in our measurements. Prices actively quoted on national exchanges are used to determine the fair value of most of our assets and liabilities recorded on our balance sheet at fair value. Within our nonregulated operations, we utilize a mid-market pricing convention (the mid-point between the bid and ask prices) as a practical expedient for determining fair value measurement, as permitted under current accounting standards. Values derived from these sources reflect the market in which transactions involving these financial instruments are executed. We 39 Table of Contents utilize models and other valuation methods to determine fair value when external sources are not available. Values are adjusted to reflect the potential impact of an orderly liquidation of our positions over a reasonable period of time under then-current market conditions. We believe the market prices and models used to value these assets and liabilities represent the best information available with respect to closing exchange and over-the-counter quotations, time value and volatility factors underlying the assets and liabilities. Fair-value estimates also consider our own creditworthiness and the creditworthiness of the counterparties involved. Our counterparties consist primarily of financial institutions and major energy companies. This concentration of counterparties may materially impact our exposure to credit risk resulting from market, economic or regulatory conditions. Recent adverse developments in the global financial and credit markets have made it more difficult and more expensive for companies to access the short-term capital markets, which may negatively impact the creditworthiness of our counterparties. A continued tightening of the credit markets could cause more of our counterparties to fail to perform. We seek to minimize counterparty credit risk through an evaluation of their financial condition and credit ratings and the use of collateral requirements under certain circumstances. Amounts reported at fair value are subject to potentially significant volatility based upon changes in market prices, the valuation of the portfolio of our contracts, maturity and settlement of these contracts and newly originated transactions, each of which directly affect the estimated fair value of our financial instruments. We believe the market prices and models used to value these financial instruments represent the best information available with respect to closing exchange and over-the-counter quotations, time value and volatility factors underlying the contracts. Values are adjusted to reflect the potential impact of an orderly liquidation of our positions over a reasonable period of time under then current market conditions. RESULTS OF OPERATIONS Overview Atmos Energy Corporation is involved in the distribution, marketing and transportation of natural gas. Accordingly, our results of operations are impacted by the demand for natural gas, particularly during the winter heating season, and the volatility of the natural gas markets. This generally results in higher operating revenues and net income during the period from October through March of each fiscal year and lower operating revenues and either lower net income or net losses during the period from April through September of each fiscal year. As a result of the seasonality of the natural gas industry, our second fiscal quarter has historically been our most critical earnings quarter with an average of approximately 64 percent of our consolidated net income having been earned in the second quarter during the three most recently completed fiscal years. Additionally, the seasonality of our business impacts our working capital differently at various times during the year. Typically, our accounts receivable, accounts payable and short-term debt balances peak by the end of January and then start to decline, as customers begin to pay their winter heating bills. Gas stored underground, particularly in our natural gas distribution segment, typically peaks in November and declines as we utilize storage gas to serve our customers. During the current year, several external factors have impacted Atmos Energy, including, but not limited to, adverse developments in the global and financial credit markets and the unfavorable impact of the economic recession. The tightening of the credit markets has made it more difficult and more expensive for us to access the capital markets. However, during the fiscal year, we took several steps to improve our financial position. In March 2009, we successfully completed an offering of $450 million 8.5% senior notes, and used most of the proceeds in April 2009 to redeem $400 million of senior notes that were scheduled to mature in October 2009. Additionally, we enhanced our liquidity sources in various ways. In October 2008, we replaced our former $300 million 364-day committed credit facility with a new 364-day $212.5 million committed credit facility. Then, in October 2009, we replaced the $212.5 million 364-day committed credit facility with a new 364-day $200 million committed credit facility. We also converted AEM former $580 million uncommitted credit 40 Table of Contents facility to a 364-day $375 million committed credit facility in December 2008. This facility was subsequently increased to $450 million in April 2009. Finally, in April 2009 we replaced an expiring $18 million unsecured committed credit facility with a $25 million unsecured committed credit facility. After entering into these new facilities, we currently have a total of approximately $902.0 million available to us under four committed credit facilities. As a result of these developments and our continued successful financial performance, Standard & Poor Corporation (S&P) upgraded our credit rating from BBB to BBB+ in December 2008 and Moody Investors Service (Moody s) upgraded the credit rating on our senior long-term debt from Baa3 to Baa2 and our commercial paper from P-3 to P-2 in May 2009. These ratings upgrades have improved our ability to access the short-term capital markets to satisfy our liquidity requirements on more economical terms. However, the turmoil in the financial markets did also have a direct financial impact on our results of operations. We determined that the decline in fair value for certain available-for-sale securities in our Supplemental Executive Benefit Plans experienced during the year ended September 30, 2009 was other than temporary and, accordingly, recorded a $5.4 million noncash charge to impair the assets. As a result of these impairments, we do not maintain any investments that are in an unrealized loss position. Finally, challenging economic times resulted in a general decline in throughput across most of our business segments. The impact of the economic downturn is most apparent in a general decline in throughput. Our natural gas distribution segment has experienced a year-over-year 5 percent decrease in consolidated throughput, primarily associated with lower residential, commercial and industrial consumption. Declines in the demand for natural gas as a result of idle production and plant closures have contributed to an 11 percent year-over-year decrease in consolidated throughput in our regulated transmission and storage segment and a 5 percent year-over-year decrease in consolidated sales volumes in our natural gas marketing segment. However, recent improvements in rate design in our natural gas distribution segment and the ability to earn higher per-unit margins in our regulated transmission and storage and natural gas marketing segments has more than offset the decline in throughput and sales volumes. Additionally, reduced demand for natural gas has resulted in lower natural gas prices, which has contributed significantly to the increase in our operating cash flow. Consolidated Results The following table presents our consolidated financial highlights for the fiscal years ended September 30, 2009, 2008 and 2007. For the Fiscal Year Ended September 30 2009 2008 2007 (In thousands, except per share data) Operating revenues $ 4,969,080 $ 7,221,305 $ 5,898,431 Gross profit 1,346,702 1,321,326 1,250,082 Operating expenses 899,300 893,431 851,446 Operating income 447,402 427,895 398,636 Miscellaneous income (expense) (3,303 ) 2,731 9,184 Interest charges 152,830 137,922 145,236 Income before income taxes 291,269 292,704 262,584 Income tax expense 100,291 112,373 94,092 Net income $ 190,978 $ 180,331 $ 168,492 Earnings per diluted share $ 2.08 $ 2.00 $ 1.92 Historically, our regulated operations arising from our natural gas distribution and regulated transmission and storage operations contributed 65 to 85 percent of our consolidated net income. Regulated operations contributed 83 percent, 74 percent and 64 percent to our consolidated net income for fiscal years 2009, 2008, 41 Table of Contents and 2007. Our consolidated net income during the last three fiscal years was earned across our business segments as follows: For the Fiscal Year Ended September 30 2009 2008 2007 (In thousands) Natural gas distribution segment $ 116,807 $ 92,648 $ 73,283 Regulated transmission and storage segment 41,056 41,425 34,590 Natural gas marketing segment 20,194 29,989 45,769 Pipeline, storage and other segment 12,921 16,269 14,850 Net income $ 190,978 $ 180,331 $ 168,492 The following table segregates our consolidated net income and diluted earnings per share between our regulated and nonregulated operations: For the Fiscal Year Ended September 30 2009 2008 2007 (In thousands, except per share data) Regulated operations $ 157,863 $ 134,073 $ 107,873 Nonregulated operations 33,115 46,258 60,619 Consolidated net income $ 190,978 $ 180,331 $ 168,492 Diluted EPS from regulated operations $ 1.72 $ 1.49 $ 1.23 Diluted EPS from nonregulated operations 0.36 0.51 0.69 Consolidated diluted EPS $ 2.08 $ 2.00 $ 1.92 Net income during fiscal 2009 increased six percent over fiscal 2008. Net income from our regulated operations increased 18 percent during fiscal 2009. The increase primarily reflects a $32.3 million increase in gross profit resulting from the net favorable impact of various ratemaking activities in our natural gas distribution segment, partially offset by higher depreciation expense, pipeline maintenance costs and interest expense. Net income in our nonregulated operations decreased $13.1 million, primarily due to the impact of unrealized margins. Unrealized margins totaled $35.9 million which reduced earnings per share by $0.23 per diluted share. The overall increase in consolidated net income was also favorably affected by non-recurring items totaling $17.1 million, or $0.19 per diluted share, related to the following pre-tax amounts: $11.3 million related to a favorable one-time tax benefit $7.6 million related to the favorable impact of an update to the estimate for unbilled accounts $7.0 million favorable impact of the reversal of estimated uncollectible gas costs $5.4 million unfavorable impact of a non-cash impairment charge of $5.4 million related to available-for-sale securities in our Supplemental Executive Retirement Plan Net income during fiscal 2008 increased seven percent over fiscal 2007. Net income from our regulated operations increased 24 percent during fiscal 2008. The increase primarily reflects a $53.8 million increase in gross profit resulting from our ratemaking efforts, coupled with higher per-unit transportation margins and an 18 percent increase in consolidated throughput in our Atmos Pipeline Texas Division. These increases were partially offset by a four percent increase in operating expenses. Net income in our nonregulated operations experienced a 24 percent decline as less volatile natural gas market conditions significantly reduced our asset optimization margins. However, higher delivered gas margins in our natural gas marketing segment and unrealized margins partially offset this decrease. See the following discussion regarding the results of operations for each of our business operating segments. 42 Table of Contents Natural Gas Distribution Segment The primary factors that impact the results of our natural gas distribution operations are our ability to earn our authorized rates of return, the cost of natural gas, competitive factors in the energy industry and economic conditions in our service areas. Our ability to earn our authorized rates is based primarily on our ability to improve the rate design in our various ratemaking jurisdictions by reducing or eliminating regulatory lag and, ultimately, separating the recovery of our approved margins from customer usage patterns. Improving rate design is a long-term process and is further complicated by the fact that we operate in multiple rate jurisdictions. The Ratemaking Activity section of this Form 10-K describes our current rate strategy and recent ratemaking initiatives in more detail. Our natural gas distribution operations are also affected by the cost of natural gas. The cost of gas is passed through to our customers without markup. Therefore, increases in the cost of gas are offset by a corresponding increase in revenues. Accordingly, we believe gross profit is a better indicator of our financial performance than revenues. However, gross profit in our Texas and Mississippi service areas include franchise fees and gross receipts taxes, which are calculated as a percentage of revenue (inclusive of gas costs). Therefore, the amount of these taxes included in revenues is influenced by the cost of gas and the level of gas sales volumes. We record the tax expense as a component of taxes, other than income. Although changes in revenue-related taxes arising from changes in gas costs affect gross profit, over time the impact is offset within operating income. Prior to January 1, 2009, timing differences existed between the recognition of revenue for franchise fees collected from our customers and the recognition of expense of franchise taxes. These timing differences had a significant temporary effect on operating income in periods with volatile gas prices, particularly in our Mid-Tex Division. Beginning January 1, 2009, changes in our franchise fee agreements in our Mid-Tex Division became effective which should significantly reduce the impact of this timing difference on a prospective basis. Although this timing difference will still be present for gross receipts taxes, the timing differences described above should be less significant. Higher gas costs may also adversely impact our accounts receivable collections, resulting in higher bad debt expense, and may require us to increase borrowings under our credit facilities resulting in higher interest expense. Finally, higher gas costs, as well as competitive factors in the industry and general economic conditions may cause customers to conserve or use alternative energy sources. 43 Table of Contents Review of Financial and Operating Results Financial and operational highlights for our natural gas distribution segment for the fiscal years ended September 30, 2009, 2008 and 2007 are presented below.

The major components of the increase are as follows: $13.6 million net increase in rates in the Mid-Tex Division as a result of the implementation of its 2008 Rate Review Mechanism (RRM) filing with all incorporated cities in the division other than the City of Dallas and Environs (the Settled Cities) and adjustments for customers in the City of Dallas. $16.0 million increase in other rate adjustments primarily in Georgia, Kansas, Louisiana and West Texas. $7.6 million increase attributable to a non-recurring update to our estimate for gas delivered to customers but not yet billed to reflect changes in base rates in several of our jurisdictions recorded in the fiscal first quarter. $7.0 million uncollectible gas cost accrual recorded in a prior year that was reversed in the current year period. These increases were partially offset by: $17.9 million decrease as a result of a five percent decrease in consolidated distribution throughput primarily associated with lower residential, commercial and industrial consumption and warmer weather in our Colorado service area, which does not have weather-normalized rates. $10.8 million decrease due to lower revenue related taxes, partially offset by the associated franchise and state gross receipts tax expense recorded as a component of taxes other than income discussed below. Operating expenses, which include operation and maintenance expense, provision for doubtful accounts, depreciation and amortization expense, taxes, other than income and asset impairments decreased $9.3 million, primarily due to the following: $10.6 million decrease due to lower legal, fuel and other administrative costs. $9.2 million decrease in allowance for doubtful accounts due to the impact of recent rate design changes in certain jurisdictions that allow us to recover the gas cost portion of uncollectible accounts as well as a 23 percent year-over-year decline in the average cost of gas. $9.2 million decrease in taxes other than income primarily associated with lower franchise fees and state gross receipt taxes. These decreases were partially offset by: $15.1 million increase in depreciation and amortization, due primarily to additional assets placed in service during the current year. $4.6 million increase due to a noncash charge to impair certain available-for-sale investments as we believed the fair value of these investments would not recover within a reasonable period of time. Results for the current year include a $10.5 million tax benefit associated with updating the rates used to determine our deferred taxes. In addition, results for the prior year included a $1.2 million gain on the sale of irrigation assets in our West Texas Division. Interest charges increased $6.1 million primarily due to the effect of the Company March 2009 issuance of $450 million 8.50% senior notes to repay $400 million 4.00% senior notes in April 2009. In addition, we experienced higher average short-term debt balances, interest rates and commitment fees during the current year compared to the prior year. 45 Table of Contents Fiscal year ended September 30, 2008 compared with fiscal year ended September 30, 2007 The $53.4 million increase in natural gas distribution gross profit is primarily the result of increased rates and higher revenue-related taxes. The major components of the increase are as follows: $29.2 million increase in rates in the Mid-Tex Division due to its 2006 GRIP filing, the fiscal 2008 and 2007 rate cases and the absence of a one time GRIP refund that occurred in fiscal 2007. $14.4 million increase in rates in the Kansas, Kentucky, Louisiana, Tennessee and West Texas divisions. $8.6 million increase due to higher revenue related taxes, partially offset by the associated franchise and state gross receipts tax expense recorded as a component of taxes other than income discussed below. $7.5 million increase due to an accrual for estimated unrecoverable gas costs in fiscal 2007 that did not recur in fiscal 2008. Operating expenses, which include operation and maintenance expense, provision for doubtful accounts, depreciation and amortization expense and taxes, other than income, increased by a net $13.4 million, primarily due to the following: $9.0 million increase primarily due to higher employee and administrative costs and increased natural gas odorization and fuel costs. $7.2 increase in franchise and state gross receipts taxes due to higher revenues. $4.3 million increase due to the absence in the current year of the deferral of hurricane-related operation and maintenance expenses in fiscal 2007. $3.3 million noncash charge associated with the write-off of software costs in fiscal 2007 that did not recur in fiscal 2008. These increases were offset by a $3.2 million decrease in the provision for doubtful accounts, which reflects our continued effective collection efforts. The increase in miscellaneous income primarily reflects the recognition of a $1.2 million gain on the sale of irrigation assets in our West Texas Division during the fiscal 2008 second quarter. Interest charges allocated to the natural gas distribution segment decreased $3.7 million due to lower average outstanding short-term debt balances in fiscal 2008 compared with fiscal 2007. Regulated Transmission and Storage Segment Our regulated transmission and storage segment consists of the regulated pipeline and storage operations of the Atmos Pipeline Texas Division. The Atmos Pipeline Texas Division transports natural gas to our Mid-Tex Division and third parties and manages five underground storage reservoirs in Texas. We also provide ancillary services customary in the pipeline industry including parking arrangements, lending and sales of inventory on hand. Similar to our natural gas distribution segment, our regulated transmission and storage segment is impacted by seasonal weather patterns, competitive factors in the energy industry and economic conditions in our service areas. Natural gas prices do not directly impact the results of this segment as revenues are derived from the transportation of natural gas. However, natural gas prices could influence the level of drilling activity in the markets that we serve, which may influence the level of throughput we may be able to transport on our pipeline. Additionally, pricing differences that occur between the natural gas hubs served by our pipeline could significantly impact our results as we can profit through the arbitrage of these spreads. Spread differences are influenced by supply and demand constraints not only in the markets we directly serve but in other markets as well. Further, as the Atmos Pipeline Texas Division operations supply all of the natural gas for our Mid-Tex Division, the results of this segment are highly dependent upon the natural gas requirements of the Mid-Tex Division. Finally, as a regulated pipeline, the operations of the Atmos Pipeline Texas Division may be impacted by the timing of when costs and expenses are incurred and when these costs and expenses are recovered through its tariffs. 46 Table of Contents Review of Financial and Operating Results Financial and operational highlights for our regulated transmission and storage segment for the fiscal years ended September 30, 2009, 2008 and 2007 are presented below.

These increases were partially offset by an $8.4 million decrease associated with a decrease in transportation volumes to our Mid-Tex Division due to warmer weather and a decrease in electrical generation, Barnett Shale and HUB deliveries. Operating expenses increased $10.3 million primarily due to higher levels of pipeline maintenance activities. Results for the current-year period also include a $1.7 million tax benefit associated with updating the rates used to determine our deferred taxes. Fiscal year ended September 30, 2008 compared with fiscal year ended September 30, 2007 The $32.7 million increase in regulated transmission and storage gross profit is primarily the result of rate adjustments and increased volumes. The major components of the increase are as follows: $13.1 million increase from rate adjustments resulting from our 2006 and 2007 GRIP filings. $8.3 million increase from transportation volumes as consolidated throughput increased 18 percent primarily due to increased transportation in the Barnett Shale region of Texas. 47 Table of Contents $8.0 million increase related to increased service fees and per-unit transportation margins due to favorable market conditions. $1.5 million increase due to new compression contracts and transportation capacity enhancements. $1.3 million increase in sales of excess gas compared to 2007. Operating expenses increased $22.8 million primarily due to increased pipeline integrity and maintenance costs. Natural Gas Marketing Segment AEM primary business is to aggregate and purchase gas supply, arrange transportation and storage logistics and ultimately deliver gas to customers at competitive prices. In addition, AEM utilizes proprietary and customer-owned transportation and storage assets to provide various services our customers request, including furnishing natural gas supplies at fixed and market-based prices, contract negotiation and administration, load forecasting, gas storage acquisition and management services, transportation services, peaking sales and balancing services, capacity utilization strategies and gas price hedging through the use of financial instruments. As a result, AEM margins arise from the types of commercial transactions we have structured with our customers and our ability to identify the lowest cost alternative among the natural gas supplies, transportation and markets to which it has access to serve those customers. AEM seeks to enhance its gross profit margin by maximizing, through asset optimization activities, the economic value associated with the storage and transportation capacity we own or control in our natural gas distribution and natural gas marketing segments. We attempt to meet this objective by engaging in natural gas storage transactions in which we seek to find and profit through the arbitrage of pricing differences in various locations and by recognizing pricing differences that occur over time. This process involves purchasing physical natural gas, storing it in the storage and transportation assets to which AEM has access and selling financial instruments at advantageous prices to lock in a gross profit margin. AEM continually manages its net physical position to attempt to increase the future economic profit that was created when the original transaction was executed. Therefore, AEM may subsequently change its originally scheduled storage injection and withdrawal plans from one time period to another based on market conditions and recognize any associated gains or losses at that time. If AEM elects to accelerate the withdrawal of physical gas, it will execute new financial instruments to hedge the original financial instruments. If AEM elects to defer the withdrawal of gas, it will reset its financial instruments by settling the original financial instruments and executing new financial instruments to correspond to the revised withdrawal schedule. We use financial instruments, designated as fair value hedges, to hedge our natural gas inventory used in our natural gas marketing storage activities. These financial instruments are marked to market each month based upon the NYMEX price with changes in fair value recognized as unrealized gains and losses in the period of change. The hedged natural gas inventory is marked to market at the end of each month based on the Gas Daily index with changes in fair value recognized as unrealized gains and losses in the period of change. Changes in the spreads between the forward natural gas prices used to value the financial hedges designated against our physical inventory and the market (spot) prices used to value our physical storage result in unrealized margins until the underlying physical gas is withdrawn and the related financial instruments are settled. Once the gas is withdrawn and the financial instruments are settled, the previously unrealized margins associated with these net positions are realized. AEM also uses financial instruments to capture additional storage arbitrage opportunities that may arise after the original physical inventory hedge and to attempt to insulate and protect the economic value within its asset optimization activities. Changes in fair value associated with these financial instruments are recognized as a component of unrealized margins until they are settled. Due to the nature of these operations, natural gas prices have a significant impact on our natural gas marketing operations. Within our delivered gas activities, higher natural gas prices may adversely impact our 48 Table of Contents accounts receivable collections, resulting in higher bad debt expense, and may require us to increase borrowings under our credit facilities resulting in higher interest expense. Higher gas prices, as well as competitive factors in the industry and general economic conditions may also cause customers to conserve or use alternative energy sources. Within our asset optimization activities, higher gas prices could also lead to increased borrowings under our credit facilities resulting in higher interest expense. Volatility in natural gas prices also has a significant impact on our natural gas marketing segment. Increased price volatility often has a significant impact on the spreads between the market (spot) prices and forward natural gas prices, which creates opportunities to earn higher arbitrage spreads within our asset optimization activities. However, increased volatility impacts the amounts of unrealized margins recorded in our gross profit and could impact the amount of cash required to collateralize our risk management liabilities. Review of Financial and Operating Results Financial and operational highlights for our natural gas marketing segment for the fiscal years ended September 30, 2009, 2008 and 2007 are presented below. Gross profit margin consists primarily of margins earned from the delivery of gas and related services requested by our customers and margins earned from asset optimization activities, which are derived from the utilization of our proprietary and managed third party storage and transportation assets to capture favorable arbitrage spreads through natural gas trading activities. Unrealized margins represent the unrealized gains or losses on our net physical position and the related financial instruments used to manage commodity price risk as described above. These margins fluctuate based upon changes in the spreads between the physical and forward natural gas prices. Generally, if the physical/financial spread narrows, we will record unrealized gains or lower unrealized losses. If the physical/financial spread widens, we will record unrealized losses or lower unrealized gains. The magnitude of the unrealized gains and losses is also dependent upon the levels of our net physical position at the end of the reporting period.

In the prior year, delivered gas activities represented substantially all of AEM realized gross profit margin. The $45.5 million increase in realized gross profit reflected: A $43.8 million increase in asset optimization margins. AEM realized substantially all of its realized asset optimization margin in the fiscal 2009 first quarter when it realized substantially all of the economic value that it had captured as of September 30, 2008 from withdrawing gas and settling the associated financial instruments. Since that time, as a result of falling current cash prices, AEM has been deferring storage withdrawals and has been a net injector of gas into storage to increase the economic value it could realize in future periods from its asset optimization activities. In the prior year, AEM deferred storage withdrawals primarily into fiscal 2009 and recognized losses on the settlement of the associated financial instruments. A $1.7 million increase in realized delivered gas margins. AEM experienced a six percent increase in per-unit margins as a result of improved basis spreads in certain market areas where we were able to better optimize transportation assets and successful contract renewals. These margin improvements more than offset a four percent decrease in gross sales volumes primarily attributable to lower industrial demand as a result of the current economic climate. The increase in realized gross profit was more than offset by a $53.9 million decrease in unrealized margins attributable to the following: The realization of unrealized gains recorded during fiscal 2008. A modest widening of the physical/financial spreads, partially offset by favorable unrealized basis gains in certain markets. A 5.8 Bcf increase in AEM net physical position. Operating expenses, which include operation and maintenance expense, provision for doubtful accounts, depreciation and amortization expense, taxes, other than income taxes, and asset impairments, increased $1.6 million primarily due the following factors: $4.0 million increase in legal and other administrative costs. $2.4 million decrease related to tax matters incurred in the prior year that did not recur in the current year. Asset Optimization Activities AEM monitors the impact of its asset optimization efforts by estimating the gross profit, before related fees, that it captured through the purchase and sale of physical natural gas and the execution of the associated financial instruments. This economic value, combined with the effect of the future reversal of unrealized gains or losses currently recognized in the income statement and related fees is referred to as the potential gross profit. We define potential gross profit as the change in AEM gross profit in future periods if its optimization efforts are executed as planned. This amount does not include other operating expenses and associated income taxes that will be incurred to realize this amount. Therefore, it does not represent an estimated increase in future net income. There is no assurance that the economic value or the potential gross profit will be fully realized in the future. We consider this measure a non-GAAP financial measure as it is calculated using both forward-looking storage injection/withdrawal and hedge settlement estimates and historical financial information. This measure is presented because we believe it provides a more comprehensive view to investors of our asset optimization efforts and thus a better understanding of these activities than would be presented by GAAP measures alone. 50 Table of Contents The following table presents AEM economic value and its potential gross profit (loss) at September 30, 2009 and 2008. September 30 2009 2008 (In millions, unless otherwise noted) Economic value $ 28.6 $ 48.5 Associated unrealized (gains) losses 11.0 (36.4 ) Subtotal 39.6 12.1 Related fees (1) (14.7 ) (19.6 ) Potential gross profit (loss) $ 24.9 $ (7.5 ) Net physical position (Bcf) 13.8 8.0 (1) Related fees represent AEM contractual costs to acquire the storage capacity utilized in its asset optimization operations. The fees primarily consist of demand fees and contractual obligations to sell gas below market index prices in exchange for the right to manage and optimize third party storage assets for the positions AEM has entered into as of September 30, 2009 and 2008. During the year ended September 30, 2009, AEM economic value decreased from $48.5 million, or $6.08/Mcf at September 30, 2008, to $28.6 million, or $2.07/Mcf. As discussed above, in the fiscal 2009 first quarter, AEM withdrew gas and realized substantially all of the economic value that it captured as of September 30, 2008. During the remainder of the year, as a result of falling current cash prices, AEM deferred certain storage withdrawals and has been a net injector of gas into storage to increase economic value that it can realize in future periods. The economic value is based upon planned storage injection and withdrawal schedules and its realization is contingent upon the execution of this plan, weather and other execution factors. Since AEM actively manages and optimizes its portfolio to attempt to enhance the future profitability of its storage position, it may change its scheduled storage injection and withdrawal plans from one time period to another based on market conditions. Therefore, we cannot ensure that the economic value or the potential gross profit calculated as of September 30, 2009 will be fully realized in the future nor can we ensure in what time periods such realization may occur. Further, if we experience operational or other issues which limit our ability to optimally manage our stored gas positions, our earnings could be adversely impacted. Assuming AEM fully executes its plan in place on September 30, 2009, without encountering operational or other issues, we anticipate the majority of the potential gross profit as of September 30, 2009 will be recognized during the first and second quarters of fiscal 2010. Fiscal year ended September 30, 2008 compared with fiscal year ended September 30, 2007 AEM delivered gas business represented substantially all of AEM realized gross profit margin in fiscal 2008. In fiscal 2007, AEM delivered gas business contributed 66 percent to total realized margins during the year with asset optimization activities contributing the remaining 34 percent. The $18.4 million decrease in realized gross profit reflected: A $35.0 million decrease in realized asset optimization margins. As a result of less volatile natural gas market conditions experienced during fiscal 2008, AEM regularly deferred storage withdrawals and reset the associated financial instruments to increase the future economic value it could realize in future periods from its asset optimization activities. AEM recognized losses on the settlement of the associated financial instruments without corresponding storage withdrawal gains. In fiscal 2007, AEM changed its withdrawal schedule within the fiscal year and recognized substantially smaller losses from resetting its position. Increased storage fees during fiscal 2008 also contributed to the decrease. A $16.6 million increase in realized delivered gas margins. Gross sales volumes increased eight percent due to the successful execution of our marketing strategies. Basis gains and contract renewals increased 51 Table of Contents per-unit margins 19 percent. Excluding the impact of basis gains, per-unit margins increased seven percent in fiscal 2008. The decrease in realized gross profit was partially offset by a $7.1 million increase in unrealized margins attributable to: A narrowing of the spreads between current cash prices and forward natural gas prices. This impact was partially mitigated by a 4.3 Bcf decrease in the net physical position. The realization of unrealized gains recorded during fiscal 2007. Operating expenses increased $7.4 million primarily due to the following: $5.0 million increase in other administrative costs. $2.4 million increase associated with property taxes. Pipeline, Storage and Other Segment Our pipeline, storage and other segment consists primarily of the operations of Atmos Pipeline and Storage, LLC (APS). APS is engaged in nonregulated transmission, storage and natural gas-gathering services. Its primary asset is a proprietary 21 mile pipeline located in New Orleans, Louisiana that is primarily used to aggregate gas supply for our regulated natural gas distribution division in Louisiana and for our natural gas marketing segment, and, on a more limited basis, to third parties. APS also owns or has an interest in underground storage fields in Kentucky and Louisiana that are used to reduce the need of our natural gas distribution divisions to contract for additional pipeline capacity to meet customer demand during peak periods. APS also engages in asset optimization activities whereby it seeks to maximize the economic value associated with the storage and transportation capacity it owns or controls. Certain of these arrangements are with regulated affiliates of the Company which have been approved by applicable state regulatory commissions. Generally, these asset management plans require APS to share with our regulated customers a portion of the profits earned from these arrangements. APS also seeks to maximize the economic value associated with the storage and transportation capacity it owns or controls by engaging in natural gas storage transactions in which we seek to find and profit from the pricing differences that occur over time. Results for this segment are primarily impacted by seasonal weather patterns and, similar to our natural gas marketing segment, volatility in the natural gas markets. Additionally, this segment results include an unrealized component as APS hedges its risk associated with its asset optimization activities. 52 Table of Contents Review of Financial and Operating Results Financial and operational highlights for our pipeline, storage and other segment for the fiscal years ended September 30, 2009, 2008 and 2007 are presented below. For the Fiscal Year Ended September 30 2009 2008 2007 2009 vs. 2008 2008 vs. 2007 (In thousands) Storage and transportation services $ 12,784 $ 14,247 $ 14,213 $ (1,463 ) $ 34 Asset optimization 21,474 5,178 12,101 16,296 (6,923 ) Other 2,728 4,183 4,197 (1,455 ) (14 ) Unrealized margins (7,490 ) 4,705 2,097 (12,195 ) 2,608 Gross profit 29,496 28,313 32,608 1,183 (4,295 ) Operating expenses 11,019 8,064 10,373 2,955 (2,309 ) Operating income 18,477 20,249 22,235 (1,772 ) (1,986 ) Miscellaneous income 6,253 8,428 8,173 (2,175 ) 255 Interest charges 1,830 2,322 6,055 (492 ) (3,733 ) Income before income taxes 22,900 26,355 24,353 (3,455 ) 2,002 Income tax expense 9,979 10,086 9,503 (107 ) 583 Net income $ 12,921 $ 16,269 $ 14,850 $ (3,348 ) $ 1,419 Fiscal year ended September 30, 2009 compared with fiscal year ended September 30, 2008 Gross profit from our pipeline, storage and other segment increased $1.2 million primarily due to the following: $16.3 million increase in asset optimization margins as a result of larger realized gains from the settlement of financial positions associated with storage and trading activities, basis gains earned from utilizing controlled pipeline capacity and higher margins earned under asset management plans. $12.2 million decrease in unrealized margins associated with our asset optimization activities due to a widening of the spreads between current cash prices and forward natural gas prices. Operating expenses increased $3.0 million primarily due to increased employee costs and higher depreciation expense which was largely attributable to additional assets placed in service during the year. Fiscal year ended September 30, 2008 compared with fiscal year ended September 30, 2007 Gross profit from our pipeline, storage and other segment decreased $4.3 million primarily due to the following factors: $6.9 million decrease in asset optimization margins as a result of a less volatile natural gas market. $2.6 million increase in unrealized margins associated with asset optimization activities. Operating expenses decreased $2.3 million primarily due to the absence in fiscal 2008 of a $3.0 million noncash charge recorded in fiscal 2007 related to the write-off of costs associated with a natural gas gathering project. LIQUIDITY AND CAPITAL RESOURCES The liquidity required to fund our working capital, capital expenditures and other cash needs is provided from a variety of sources including internally generated funds and borrowings under our commercial paper program and bank credit facilities. Additionally, we have various uncommitted trade credit lines with our gas suppliers that we utilize to purchase natural gas on a monthly basis without using our credit facilities. Finally, from time to time, we raise funds from the public debt and equity capital markets to fund our liquidity needs. 53 Table of Contents The primary means we use to fund our working capital needs and growth is to utilize internally generated funds and to access the commercial paper markets. Adverse developments in global financial and credit markets during the first fiscal quarter of 2009 made it more difficult and more expensive for the Company to access the short-term capital markets, including the commercial paper market, to satisfy our liquidity requirements. Consequently, during the first quarter, we experienced higher than normal borrowings under our five-year credit facility used to backstop our commercial paper program in lieu of commercial paper borrowings to fund our working capital needs. However, subsequent to the end of the first quarter, credit market conditions improved, both as to availability and interest rates, and we have been able to access the commercial paper markets on more reasonably economical terms. Further, as a result of our financing activities described below, we received credit rating upgrades from two of the three credit rating agencies, which has reduced the cost of our commercial paper borrowings. At September 30, 2009, we had commercial paper outstanding of $72.6 million under this facility and $494.1 million was available. On March 26, 2009, we closed our offering of $450 million of 8.50% senior notes due 2019. Most of the net proceeds of approximately $446 million were used to redeem our $400 million 4.00% unsecured senior notes on April 30, 2009, prior to their October 2009 maturity. In connection with the repayment of the $400 million 4.00% unsecured senior notes, we paid a $6.6 million call premium in accordance with the terms of the senior notes and accrued interest of approximately $0.6 million. The remaining net proceeds were used for general corporate purposes. In October 2009, we replaced our former $212.5 million 364-day committed credit facility that was entered into in October 2008 with a new 364-day credit facility on similar terms that will allow borrowings up to $200.0 million and expires in October 2010. In December 2008, we converted AEM former $580 million uncommitted credit facility to a $375 million committed credit facility that will expire in December 2009. Effective April 1, 2009, we exercised the accordion feature of this facility to increase the credit available under the facility to $450 million. We are currently negotiating to renew this facility. In addition, we replaced our $18 million unsecured committed credit facility that expired in March 2009 with a $25 million unsecured facility effective April 1, 2009. As a result of executing these new agreements, we have a total of approximately $1.3 billion available to us under four committed credit facilities. As of September 30, 2009, the amount available to us under our credit facilities, net of outstanding letters of credit, was approximately $902 million. We believe the liquidity provided by our committed credit facilities, combined with our operating cash flows, will be sufficient to fund our working capital needs, capital expenditures and other expenditures for fiscal year 2010. Cash Flows Our internally generated funds may change in the future due to a number of factors, some of which we cannot control. These include regulatory changes, the price for our services, the demand for such products and services, margin requirements resulting from significant changes in commodity prices, operational risks and other factors. Cash flows from operating, investing and financing activities for the years ended September 30, 2009, 2008 and 2007 are presented below. For the Fiscal Year Ended September 30 2009 2008 2007 2009 vs. 2008 2008 vs. 2007 (In thousands) Total cash provided by (used in) Operating activities $ 919,233 $ 370,933 $ 547,095 $ 548,300 $ (176,162 ) Investing activities (517,201 ) (483,009 ) (402,871 ) (34,192 ) (80,138 ) Financing activities (337,546 ) 98,068 (159,314 ) (435,614 ) 257,382 Change in cash and cash equivalents $ 64,486 $ (14,008 ) $ (15,090 ) $ 78,494 $ 1,082 54 Table of Contents Cash flows from operating activities Year-over-year changes in our operating cash flows primarily are attributable to changes in net income, working capital changes, particularly within our natural gas distribution segment resulting from the price of natural gas and the timing of customer collections, payments for natural gas purchases and purchased gas cost recoveries. The significant factors impacting our operating cash flow for the last three fiscal years are summarized below. Fiscal Year ended September 30, 2009 compared with fiscal year ended September 30, 2008 Operating cash flows were $548.3 million higher in fiscal 2009 compared to fiscal 2008, primarily due to the following: $368.9 million increase attributable to the favorable impact on our working capital due to the decline in natural gas prices in the current year compared to the prior year. $56.8 million increase due to lower cash margin requirements related to our natural gas marketing financial instruments. These increases were partially offset by a $21.0 million decrease due to a contribution made to our pension plans in the current year. Fiscal Year ended September 30, 2008 compared with fiscal year ended September 30, 2007 Operating cash flows were $176.2 million lower in fiscal 2008 compared to fiscal 2007, primarily due to the following: $95.7 million decrease due to higher cash margin requirements related to our natural gas marketing financial instruments. $92.6 million decrease due to the unfavorable timing of gas cost collections in our natural gas distribution segment. Cash flows from investing activities In recent fiscal years, a substantial portion of our cash resources has been used to fund acquisitions and growth projects, our ongoing construction program and improvements to information technology systems. Our ongoing construction program enables us to provide natural gas distribution services to our existing customer base, expand our natural gas distribution services into new markets, enhance the integrity of our pipelines and, more recently, expand our intrastate pipeline network. In executing our current rate strategy, we are focusing our capital spending in jurisdictions that permit us to earn an adequate return timely on our investment without compromising the safety or reliability of our system. Currently, our Mid-Tex, Louisiana, Mississippi and West Texas natural gas distribution divisions and our Atmos Pipeline Texas Division have rate designs that provide the opportunity to include in their rate base approved capital costs on a periodic basis without being required to file a rate case. For the fiscal year ended September 30, 2009, we incurred $509.5 million for capital expenditures compared with $472.3 million for the fiscal year ended September 30, 2008 and $392.4 million for the fiscal year ended September 30, 2007. The increase in capital expenditures in fiscal 2009 compared to fiscal 2008 primarily reflects $32.6 million related to spending for a regulated transmission pipeline project completed in the fourth quarter of 2009. The increase in capital expenditures in fiscal 2008 compared to fiscal 2007 primarily reflects the following: $50.3 million increase in compliance spending and main replacements in our Mid-Tex Division. $12.8 million increase in the natural gas distribution segment for our new automated meter reading initiative. $4.7 million increase related to spending for two nonregulated growth projects. 55 Table of Contents Cash flows from financing activities For the fiscal year ended September 30, 2009, our financing activities used $337.5 million in cash, while financing activities for the fiscal year ended September 30, 2008 provided $98.1 million in cash compared with cash of $159.3 million used for the fiscal year ended September 30, 2007. Our significant financing activities for the fiscal years ended September 30, 2009, 2008 and 2007 are summarized as follows: 2009 During the fiscal year ended September 30, 2009, we: Paid $407.4 million to repay our $400 million 4.00% unsecured notes. Repaid a net $284.0 million of short-term borrowings under our credit facilities. Paid $121.5 million in cash dividends, which reflected a payout ratio of 63 percent of net income. Received $445.6 million in net proceeds related to the March 2009 issuance of $450 million of 8.50% Senior Notes due 2019. The net proceeds were used to repay the $400 million 4.00% unsecured notes. Received $27.7 million net proceeds related to the issuance of 1.2 million shares of common stock. Received $1.9 million net proceeds related to the settlement of the Treasury lock agreement associated with the March 2009 issuance of the $450 million of 8.50% Senior Notes due 2019. 2008 During the fiscal year ended September 30, 2008, we: Borrowed a net $200.2 million under our short-term facilities due to the impact of seasonal natural gas purchases and the effect of higher natural gas prices. Repaid $10.3 million of long-term debt in accordance with their normal maturity schedules. Received $25.5 million in net proceeds related to the issuance of 1.0 million shares of common stock. Paid $117.3 million in dividends, which reflected a payout ratio of 65 percent of net income. 2007 During the fiscal year ended September 30, 2007, we: Repaid a net $213.2 million of short-term borrowings under our credit facilities. Paid $303.2 million to repay our $300 million unsecured floating rate senior notes as discussed below. Received $247.2 million in net proceeds related to the June 2007 issuance of $250 million of 6.35% Senior Notes due 2017. We used the net proceeds of $247 million, together with $53 million of available cash, to repay our $300 million unsecured floating rate senior notes, which were redeemed on July 15, 2007. Paid $111.7 million in dividends, which reflected a payout ratio of 67 percent of net income. Received $24.9 million related to the issuance of common stock under various plans. Received $4.8 million related to the settlement of of the Treasury lock agreement associated with the June 2007 issuance of $250 million of 6.35% Senior Notes due 2017. 56 Table of Contents The following table shows the number of shares issued for the fiscal years ended September 30, 2009, 2008 and 2007: For the Fiscal Year Ended September 30 2009 2008 2007 Shares issued: Direct stock purchase plan 407,262 388,485 325,338 Retirement savings plan 640,639 558,014 422,646 1998 Long-term incentive plan 686,046 538,450 511,584 Outside directors stock-for-fee plan 3,079 3,197 2,453 December 2006 equity offering 6,325,000 Total shares issued 1,737,026 1,488,146 7,587,021 Credit Facilities As of September 30, 2009, we had three committed credit facilities in our regulated operations totaling $804.2 million. These facilities included (1) a five-year $566.7 million unsecured facility expiring December 2011, (2) a $212.5 million unsecured facility expiring October 2009, and (3) a $25 million unsecured facility expiring March 31, 2010. At the time the $566.7 million credit facility was established, borrowings under the facility were limited to $600 million. However, in March 2009, the facility was amended to reduce the amount available to $566.7 million to reflect the bankruptcy of one lender that participated in the facility. In October 2009, we replaced our $212.5 million facility at its termination with a new $200 million unsecured 364-day facility. After giving effect to these changes, the amount available to us under our committed credit facilities was $791.7 million. As of September 30, 2009, we had no outstanding letters of credit under these facilities. AEM has a committed credit facility that can provide up to $450 million to support its nonregulated activities, primarily the issuance of letters of credit to natural gas suppliers. As of September 30, 2009, the amount available to us under this credit facility, net of outstanding letters of credit, was $170.4 million. Our credit capacity and the amount of unused borrowing capacity are affected by the seasonal nature of the natural gas business and our short-term borrowing requirements, which are typically highest during colder winter months. Our working capital needs can vary significantly due to changes in the price of natural gas charged by suppliers and the increased gas supplies required to meet customers needs during periods of cold weather. However, we believe these credit facilities, combined with our operating cash flows will be sufficient to fund our working capital needs, our fiscal 2010 capital expenditure program and our common stock dividends. These facilities are described in further detail in Note 6 to the consolidated financial statements. Shelf Registration On March 23, 2009, we filed a registration statement with the Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC) to issue, from time to time, up to $900 million in common stock and/or debt securities available for issuance, including approximately $450 million of capacity carried over from our prior shelf registration statement filed with the SEC in December 2006. Immediately following the filing of the registration statement, we issued $450 million of 8.50% senior notes due 2019 under the registration statement. Most of the net proceeds of approximately $446 million were used to repay our $400 million unsecured 4.00% senior notes on April 30, 2009. As of September 30, 2009, we had $450 million of availability remaining under the registration statement. However, due to certain restrictions placed by one state regulatory commission on our ability to issue securities under the registration statement, we now have remaining and available for issuance a total of approximately $200 million of equity securities and $250 million of debt securities. 57 Table of Contents Credit Ratings Our credit ratings directly affect our ability to obtain short-term and long-term financing, in addition to the cost of such financing. In determining our credit ratings, the rating agencies consider a number of quantitative factors, including debt to total capitalization, operating cash flow relative to outstanding debt, operating cash flow coverage of interest and pension liabilities and funding status. In addition, the rating agencies consider qualitative factors such as consistency of our earnings over time, the quality of our management and business strategy, the risks associated with our regulated and nonregulated businesses and the regulatory structures that govern our rates in the states where we operate. Our debt is rated by three rating agencies: Standard & Poor Corporation (S&P), Moody Investors Services, Inc. (Moody s) and Fitch Ratings, Ltd. (Fitch). In December 2008, S&P upgraded our senior long-term debt credit rating from BBB to BBB+ and changed our rating outlook from positive to stable. S&P cited improved financial performance and rate case decisions that have increased cash flow as the key drivers for the upgrade. In May 2009, Moody upgraded the credit rating on our senior long-term debt from Baa3 to Baa2 and on our commercial paper from P-3 to P-2. Moody stated that the key drivers for the upgrade were the completion of a major debt refinancing and the Company improving its alternate liquidity resources while maintaining solid financial performance. As of September 30, 2009, all three rating agencies maintained a stable outlook. None of our ratings are currently under review. Our current debt ratings are all considered investment grade and are as follows: S&P Moody Fitch Unsecured senior long-term debt BBB+ Baa2 BBB+ Commercial paper A-2 P-2 F-2 A significant reduction in our liquidity caused by more limited access to the private and public credit markets as a result of the recent adverse global financial and credit conditions could trigger a negative change in our ratings outlook or even a reduction in our credit ratings by the three credit rating agencies. This would mean more limited access to the private and public credit markets and an increase in the costs of such borrowings. A credit rating is not a recommendation to buy, sell or hold securities. The highest investment grade credit rating for S&P is AAA, Moody is Aaa and Fitch is AAA. The lowest investment grade credit rating for S&P is BBB-, Moody is Baa3 and Fitch is BBB-. Our credit ratings may be revised or withdrawn at any time by the rating agencies, and each rating should be evaluated independent of any other rating. There can be no assurance that a rating will remain in effect for any given period of time or that a rating will not be lowered, or withdrawn entirely, by a rating agency if, in its judgment, circumstances so warrant. Debt Covenants We were in compliance with all of our debt covenants as of September 30, 2009. Our debt covenants are described in Note 6 to the consolidated financial statements. Capitalization The following table presents our capitalization as of September 30, 2009 and 2008: September 30 2009 2008 (In thousands, except percentages) Short-term debt $ 72,550 1.6 % $ 350,542 7.7 % Long-term debt 2,169,531 49.1 % 2,120,577 46.9 % Shareholders equity 2,176,761 49.3 % 2,052,492 45.4 % Total capitalization, including short-term debt $ 4,418,842 100.0 % $ 4,523,611 100.0 % 58 Table of Contents Total debt as a percentage of total capitalization, including short-term debt, was 50.7 percent and 54.6 percent at September 30, 2009 and 2008. The decrease in the debt to capitalization ratio primarily reflects a decrease in short-term debt as of September 30, 2009 compared to the prior year. Our ratio of total debt to capitalization is typically greater during the winter heating season as we make additional short-term borrowings to fund natural gas purchases and meet our working capital requirements. We consider our optimal capitalization ratio to be in the range of 50 to 55 percent and seek to maintain this range through cash flow generated from operations, continued issuance of new common stock under our Direct Stock Purchase Plan and Retirement Savings Plan and access to the equity capital markets. Contractual Obligations and Commercial Commitments The following table provides information about contractual obligations and commercial commitments at September 30, 2009. Payments Due by Period Less Than More Than Total 1 Year 1-3 Years 3-5 Years 5 Years (In thousands) Contractual Obligations Long-term debt (1) $ 2,172,827 $ 131 $ 362,565 $ 250,131 $ 1,560,000 Short-term debt (1) 72,550 72,550 Interest charges (2) 1,181,236 141,085 245,278 206,841 588,032 Gas purchase commitments (3) 338,746 312,837 15,232 10,677 Capital lease obligations (4) 1,565 186 372 372 635 Operating leases (4) 219,010 17,764 31,409 27,731 142,106 Demand fees for contracted storage (5) 28,459 12,475 13,534 2,200 250 Demand fees for contracted transportation (6) 41,948 9,810 16,783 12,198 3,157 Financial instrument obligations (7) 21,482 21,482 Postretirement benefit plan contributions (8) 162,782 12,242 22,857 28,686 98,997 Uncertain tax positions (including interest) (9) 6,731 6,731 Total contractual obligations $ 4,247,336 $ 600,562 $ 714,761 $ 538,836 $ 2,393,177 (1) See Note 6 to the consolidated financial statements. (2) Interest charges were calculated using the stated rate for each debt issuance. (3) Gas purchase commitments were determined based upon contractually determined volumes at prices estimated based upon the index specified in the contract, adjusted for estimated basis differentials and contractual discounts as of September 30, 2009. (4) See Note 13 to the consolidated financial statements. (5) Represents third party contractual demand fees for contracted storage in our natural gas marketing and pipeline, storage and other segments. Contractual demand fees for contracted storage for our natural gas distribution segment are excluded as these costs are fully recoverable through our purchase gas adjustment mechanisms. (6) Represents third party contractual demand fees for transportation in our natural gas marketing segment. (7) Represents liabilities for natural gas commodity financial instruments that were valued as of September 30, 2009. The ultimate settlement amounts of these remaining liabilities are unknown because they are subject to continuing market risk until the financial instruments are settled. (8) Represents expected contributions to our postretirement benefit plans. (9) Represents liabilities associated with uncertain tax positions claimed or expected to be claimed on tax returns. 59 Table of Contents AEM has commitments to purchase physical quantities of natural gas under contracts indexed to the forward NYMEX strip or fixed price contracts. At September 30, 2009, AEM was committed to purchase 72.6 Bcf within one year, 19.4 Bcf within one to three years and 2.2 Bcf after three years under indexed contracts. AEM was committed to purchase 2.9 Bcf within one year under fixed price contracts with prices ranging from $2.95 to $7.68 per Mcf. With the exception of our Mid-Tex Division, our natural gas distribution segment maintains supply contracts with several vendors that generally cover a period of up to one year. Commitments for estimated base gas volumes are established under these contracts on a monthly basis at contractually negotiated prices. Commitments for incremental daily purchases are made as necessary during the month in accordance with the terms of the individual contract. Our Mid-Tex Division maintains long-term supply contracts to ensure a reliable source of gas for our customers in its service area which obligate it to purchase specified volumes at market prices. The estimated commitments under these contract terms as of September 30, 2009 are reflected in the table above. Risk Management Activities We use financial instruments to mitigate commodity price risk and, periodically, to manage interest rate risk. We conduct risk management activities through our natural gas distribution, natural gas marketing and pipeline, storage and other segments. In our natural gas distribution segment, we use a combination of physical storage, fixed physical contracts and fixed financial contracts to reduce our exposure to unusually large winter-period gas price increases. In our natural gas marketing and pipeline, storage and other segments, we manage our exposure to the risk of natural gas price changes and lock in our gross profit margin through a combination of storage and financial instruments, including futures, over-the-counter and exchange-traded options and swap contracts with counterparties. To the extent our inventory cost and actual sales and actual purchases do not correlate with the changes in the market indices we use in our hedges, we could experience ineffectiveness or the hedges may no longer meet the accounting requirements for hedge accounting, resulting in the financial instruments being treated as mark to market instruments through earnings. We use financial instruments, designated as cash flow hedges of anticipated purchases and sales at index prices, to mitigate the commodity price risk in our natural gas marketing segment associated with deliveries under fixed-priced forward contracts to deliver gas to customers, and we use financial instruments, designated as fair value hedges, to hedge our natural gas inventory used in our asset optimization activities in our natural gas marketing and pipeline, storage and other segments. Also, in our natural gas marketing segment, we use storage swaps and futures to capture additional storage arbitrage opportunities that arise subsequent to the execution of the original fair value hedge associated with our physical natural gas inventory, basis swaps to insulate and protect the economic value of our fixed price and storage books and various over-the-counter and exchange-traded options. These financial instruments have not been designated as hedges. We record our financial instruments as a component of risk management assets and liabilities, which are classified as current or noncurrent based upon the anticipated settlement date of the underlying financial instrument. Substantially all of our financial instruments are valued using external market quotes and indices. The following table shows the components of the change in fair value of our natural gas distribution segment financial instruments for the fiscal year ended September 30, 2009 (in thousands): Fair value of contracts at September 30, 2008 $ (63,677 ) Contracts realized/settled (102,943 ) Fair value of new contracts 353 Other changes in value 152,101 Fair value of contracts at September 30, 2009 $ (14,166 ) 60 Table of Contents The fair value of our natural gas distribution segment financial instruments at September 30, 2009, is presented below by time period and fair value source: Fair Value of Contracts at September 30, 2009 Maturity in Years Less Greater Total Fair Source of Fair Value Than 1 1-3 4-5 Than 5 Value (In thousands) Prices actively quoted $ (15,786 ) $ 1,620 $ $ $ (14,166 ) Prices based on models and other valuation methods Total Fair Value $ (15,786 ) $ 1,620 $ $ $ (14,166 ) The following table shows the components of the change in fair value of our natural gas marketing segment financial instruments for the fiscal year ended September 30, 2009 (in thousands): Fair value of contracts at September 30, 2008 $ 16,542 Contracts realized/settled 22,327 Fair value of new contracts Other changes in value (12,171 ) Fair value of contracts at September 30, 2009 26,698 Netting of cash collateral 11,664 Cash collateral and fair value of contracts at September 30, 2009 $ 38,362 The fair value of our natural gas marketing segment financial instruments at September 30, 2009, is presented below by time period and fair value source. Fair Value of Contracts at September 30, 2009 Maturity in Years Less Greater Total Fair Source of Fair Value Than 1 1-3 4-5 Than 5 Value (In thousands) Prices actively quoted $ 14,283 $ 12,415 $ $ $ 26,698 Prices based on models and other valuation methods Total Fair Value $ 14,283 $ 12,415 $ $ $ 26,698 Pension and Postretirement Benefits Obligations Net Periodic Pension and Postretirement Benefit Costs For the fiscal year ended September 30, 2009, our total net periodic pension and other benefits costs was $50.2 million, compared with $47.9 million and $48.6 million for the fiscal years ended September 30, 2008 and 2007. These costs relating to our natural gas distribution operations are recoverable through our gas distribution rates. A portion of these costs is capitalized into our gas distribution rate base, and the remaining costs are recorded as a component of operation and maintenance expense. The increase in total net periodic pension and other benefits costs during fiscal 2009 compared with fiscal 2008 primarily reflects the change in assumptions we made during our annual pension plan valuation completed September 30, 2008. The discount rate used to compute the present value of a plan liabilities generally is based on rates of high-grade corporate bonds with maturities similar to the average period over which the benefits will be paid. At our September 30, 2008 measurement date, the interest rates were approximately 130 basis points higher than the interest rates at June 30, 2007, the measurement date used to determine our fiscal 2008 net periodic cost. The corresponding increase in the discount rate was the primary 61 Table of Contents driver for the increase in our fiscal 2009 pension and benefit costs. Our expected return on our pension plan assets remained constant at 8.25 percent. The periodic pension and other benefits costs remained relatively unchanged during fiscal 2008 compared with fiscal 2007 as the assumptions we made during our annual pension plan valuation completed June 30, 2007 were consistent with the prior year. At our June 30, 2007 measurement date, the interest rates were consistent with rates at our prior-year measurement date, which resulted in no change to our 6.30 percent discount rate used to determine our fiscal 2008 net periodic and post-retirement cost. In addition, our expected return on our pension plan assets remained constant at 8.25 percent. Pension and Postretirement Plan Funding Generally, our funding policy is to contribute annually an amount that will at least equal the minimum amount required to comply with the Employee Retirement Income Security Act of 1974, including the funding requirements under the Pension Protection Act of 2006 (PPA). However, additional voluntary contributions are made from time to time as considered necessary. Contributions are intended to provide not only for benefits attributed to service to date but also for those expected to be earned in the future. During fiscal 2009, we contributed $21.0 million in cash to our pension plans to achieve a desired level of funding for the 2008 plan year while maximizing the tax deductibility of this payment. The need for this funding reflected the decline in the fair value of the plans assets resulting from the unfavorable market conditions experienced during the latter half of calendar year 2008. This contribution increased the level of our plan assets to achieve a desirable funding threshold as established by the PPA. During fiscal 2008, we voluntarily contributed $2.3 million to the Atmos Energy Corporation Retirement Plan for Mississippi Valley Gas Union Employees. This contribution achieved a desired level of funding for this plan for the 2007 plan year. During fiscal 2007, we did not contribute to our pension plans. We contributed $10.1 million, $9.6 million and $11.8 million to our postretirement benefits plans for the fiscal years ended September 30, 2009, 2008 and 2007. The contributions represent the portion of the postretirement costs we are responsible for under the terms of our plan and minimum funding required by state regulatory commissions. Outlook for Fiscal 2010 As of September 30, 2009, interest and corporate bond rates utilized to determine our discount rates, which impacted our fiscal 2010 net periodic pension and postretirement costs, were lower than the interest and corporate bond rates as of September 30, 2008, the measurement date for our fiscal 2009 net periodic cost. As a result of the lower interest and corporate bond rates, we decreased the discount rate used to determine our fiscal 2010 pension and benefit costs to 5.52 percent. We maintained the expected return on our pension plan assets at 8.25 percent, despite the recent decline in the financial markets as we believe this rate reflects the average rate of expected earnings on plan assets that will fund our projected benefit obligation. Although the fair value of our plan assets has declined as the financial markets have declined, the impact of this decline is mitigated by the fact that assets are smoothed for purposes of determining net periodic pension cost which results in asset gains and losses that are recognized over time as a component of net periodic pension and benefit costs for our Pension Account Plan, our largest funded plan. Accordingly, we expect our fiscal 2010 pension and postretirement medical costs to be materially the same as in fiscal 2009. Based upon market conditions subsequent to September 30, 2009, the current funded position of the plans and the new funding requirements under the PPA, we believe it is reasonably possible that we will be required to contribute to the Plans in fiscal 2010. Further, we will consider whether an additional voluntary contribution is prudent to maintain certain PPA funding thresholds. However, we cannot anticipate with certainty whether such contributions will be made and the amount of such contributions. With respect to our postretirement medical plans, we anticipate contributing approximately $12.2 million during fiscal 2010. As of September 30, 2009, the Board of Directors approved a change to the cost sharing methodology for employees who had not met the participation requirements by that date for the Retiree Medical Plan for Retirees and Disabled Employees of Atmos Energy Corporation (the Retiree Medical Plan ). Starting in five 62 Table of Contents years, on January 1, 2015, the contribution rates that will apply to all non-grandfathered participants will be determined using a new cost sharing methodology by which Atmos Energy will limit its contribution to a three percent cost increase in claims and administrative costs each year. If medical costs covered by the Retiree Medical Plan increase more than three percent annually, participants will be responsible for the additional cost. During the last fiscal year, the Company has worked with our independent compensation consultant to develop and implement a new SERP design for any new executives or current employees selected for participation in the SERP arrangement on a prospective basis. Only those executives who are currently members of our Management Committee as well as those individuals who may be selected in the future to serve on the Management Committee, plus those executives who are active SERP participants as of August 5, 2009, will continue to participate in the current SERP arrangement until their respective retirement dates. The current SERP arrangement is a 60 percent of covered compensation defined benefit arrangement in which benefits from the underlying qualified defined benefit plan are an offset to the SERP benefit. The new SERP arrangement for new participants in the Company executive retirement program is a modified defined benefit approach in which the Company will contribute to a nominal account for each participant, an amount equal to ten percent of each participant base salary and bonus following the participant completion of a plan year of service. Other provisions of the plan mirror that of the Company underlying qualified plan, the Pension Account Plan. At this time, only one employee has been selected for participation in the new SERP arrangement. The projected pension liability, future funding requirements and the amount of pension expense or income recognized for the Plan are subject to change, depending upon the actuarial value of plan assets and the determination of future benefit obligations as of each subsequent actuarial calculation date. These amounts are impacted by actual investment returns, changes in interest rates and changes in the demographic composition of the participants in the plan.
