OVERVIEW Gartner, Inc. is a leading research and advisory firm that helps executives use technology to build, guide and grow their enterprises. We offer independent and objective research and analysis on the information technology, computer hardware, software, communications and related technology industries. We provide comprehensive coverage of the IT industry to approximately 10,000 client organizations, including approximately 400 Fortune 500 companies, across 75 countries. Our client base consists primarily of CIOs and other senior IT and business executives from a wide variety of enterprises, government agencies and the investment community. We employ a diversified business model that utilizes and leverages the breadth and depth of our research intellectual capital while enabling us to maintain and grow our market-leading position and brand franchise. The foundation for our business model is our ability to create and distribute our unique, proprietary research content as broadly as possible via: published reports and briefings, consulting and advisory services, and hosting symposia, conferences and exhibitions. In early 2005, we undertook an initiative to better utilize the intellectual capital associated with our core research product. Our diversified business model provides multiple entry points and synergies that facilitate increased client spending on our research, consulting and events. A critical part of our long-term strategy is to increase business volume with our most valuable clients, identifying relationships with the greatest sales potential and expanding those relationships by offering strategically relevant research and analysis. We also seek to extend the Gartner brand name to develop new client relationships, and augment our sales capacity and expand into new markets around the world. In addition, we seek to increase our revenue and operating cash flow through more effective pricing of our products and services. These initiatives have created additional revenue streams through more effective packaging, campaigning and cross-selling of our products and services. We intend to maintain a balance between (1) pursuing opportunities and applying resources with a strict focus on growing our three core businesses and (2) generating profitability through a streamlined cost structure. We have three business segments: Research, Consulting and Events. Research provides insight for CIOs, IT professionals, technology companies and the investment community through reports and briefings, access to our analysts, as well as peer networking services and membership programs designed specifically for CIOs and other senior executives. Consulting consists primarily of consulting, measurement engagements and strategic advisory services (paid one-day analyst engagements) ( SAS ), which provide assessments of cost, performance, efficiency and quality focused on the IT industry. Events consists of various symposia, conferences and exhibitions focused on the IT industry. We believe the following business measurements are important performance indicators for our business segments: BUSINESS SEGMENT BUSINESS MEASUREMENTS Research Contract value represents the value attributable to all of our subscription-related research products that recognize revenue on a ratable basis. Contract value is calculated as the annualized value of all subscription research contracts in effect at a specific point in time, without regard to the duration of the contract. Client retention rate represents a measure of client satisfaction and renewed business relationships at a specific point in time. Client retention is calculated on a percentage basis by dividing our current clients, who were also clients a year ago, by all clients from a year ago. Wallet retention rate represents a measure of the amount of contract value we have retained with clients over 14 Table of Contents BUSINESS SEGMENT BUSINESS MEASUREMENTS a twelve-month period. Wallet retention is calculated on a percentage basis by dividing the contract value of clients, who were clients one year earlier, by the total contract value from a year earlier. When wallet retention exceeds client retention, it is an indication of retention of higher-spending clients, or increased spending by retained clients, or both. Number of executive program members represents the number of paid participants in executive programs. Consulting Consulting backlog represents future revenue to be derived from in-process consulting, measurement and strategic advisory services engagements. Utilization rates represent a measure of productivity of our consultants. Utilization rates are calculated for billable headcount on a percentage basis by dividing total hours billed by total hours available to bill. Billing Rate represents earned billable revenue divided by total billable hours. Average annualized revenue per billable headcount represents a measure of the revenue generating ability of an average billable consultant and is calculated periodically by multiplying the average billing rate per hour times the utilization percentage times the billable hours available for one year. Events Number of events represents the total number of hosted events completed during the period. Number of attendees represents the number of people who attend events. EXECUTIVE SUMMARY OF OPERATIONS AND FINANCIAL POSITION Our 2006 results continue to reflect our focused execution on our strategy to grow our research business and improve our operational margins. We continue to invest in our sales capability, and our sales force of 663 associates is up approximately 21% from the prior year. The Research segment benefited strongly from this investment, with revenue up 9% in 2006, to $571.2 million from $523.0 million in 2005. Contract value at December 31, 2006 was the highest in the Company history, at $640.3 million, up 11% over the prior year excluding the impact of foreign currency. Contract value has now increased for 12 consecutive quarters. Both our research client retention rate and wallet retention remained strong at year-end 2006, at 81% and 96%, respectively. Revenue from our Consulting segment was $305.2 million in 2006, up 1% compared to the prior year. Consulting backlog at December 31, 2006 was $109.8 million, up about 2% from September 30, 2006, but down about 8% from December 31, 2005. The consultant utilization rate increased 2 points, to 64% in 2006 from 62% in 2005. Both the average hourly billing rate and the average annualized revenue per billable headcount remained strong. Billable headcount was down about 2% from the prior year, reflecting our planned focus on operational effectiveness over growth. Our Events segment continues to deliver strong revenue growth. Our continuing emphasis on managing the Events portfolio to retain successful events and introduce promising new events continues to yield increasing revenue performance. Revenue for this segment in 2006 was up 12% over the prior year, with increases in both our on-going events and new events. We held 74 events in 2006 compared to 70 in the prior year period and had an overall increase in attendance of 17%. For a more detailed discussion of our segment results, see Segment Results below. We also continue our focus on enhancing shareholder value through the continued evolution of our capital structure. During 2006, we repurchased 15.8 million shares of our common stock through both open market purchases and direct share repurchases from Silver Lake. In addition, in January 2007 we closed on a new credit facility which increased our total debt capacity to $480.0 million, and in February 2007 our Board of Directors approved a new $200.0 million share buyback program. On January 1, 2006, we adopted the new accounting rule for stock-based compensation, SFAS No. 123(R), and as a result we are now recording compensation expense for all stock-based compensation awards granted to employees. The Company awards stock-based compensation as an incentive for employees to contribute to our long-term success and to better align the interests of our employees and our shareholders. We had net income of $58.2 million in 2006, or $0.50 per diluted share, compared to a loss of $(0.02) per diluted share for the prior year period, and we ended the year with $67.8 million of cash. FLUCTUATIONS IN QUARTERLY OPERATING RESULTS Our quarterly and annual revenue, operating income, and cash flow fluctuate as a result of many factors, including: the timing of Symposium, our flagship event that normally occurs during the fourth calendar quarter, and other events; the amount of new business generated; the mix of domestic and international business; changes in market demand for our products and services; changes in foreign 15 Table of Contents currency rates; the timing of the development, introduction and marketing of new products and services; and competition in the industry. The potential fluctuations in our operating income could cause period-to-period comparisons of operating results not to be meaningful and could provide an unreliable indication of future operating results. CRITICAL ACCOUNTING POLICIES AND ESTIMATES The preparation of financial statements requires the application of appropriate accounting policies. Our significant accounting policies are described in Note 1 in the Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements. Management considers the policies discussed below to be critical to an understanding of our financial statements because their application requires complex and subjective judgments and estimates. Specific risks for these critical accounting policies are described below. Revenue recognition We recognize revenue in accordance with SEC Staff Accounting Bulletin No. 101, Revenue Recognition in Financial Statements ( SAB 101 ), and SEC Staff Accounting Bulletin No. 104, Revenue Recognition ( SAB 104 ). Revenue by significant source is accounted for as follows: Research revenues are derived from subscription contracts for research products. Revenues from research products are deferred and recognized ratably over the applicable contract term; Consulting revenues are generated from fixed fee and time and material engagements. Revenue from fixed fee contracts is recognized on a percentage of completion basis. Revenues from time and materials engagements is recognized as work is delivered and/or services are provided; Events revenues are deferred and recognized upon the completion of the related symposium, conference or exhibition; Other revenues consist primarily of fees from research reprints and software licensing. Reprint fees are recognized when the reprint is shipped. Fees from software licensing are recognized when a signed non-cancelable software license exists, delivery has occurred and collection is probable, and the fees are fixed or determinable; The majority of research contracts are billable upon signing, absent special terms granted on a limited basis from time to time. All research contracts are non-cancelable and non-refundable, except for government contracts that have a 30-day cancellation clause, but have not produced material cancellations to date. It is our policy to record the entire amount of the contract that is billable as a fee receivable at the time the contract is signed with a corresponding amount as deferred revenue, since the contract represents a legally enforceable claim. For those government contracts that permit termination, we bill the client the full amount billable under the contract but only record a receivable equal to the earned portion of the contract. In addition, we only record deferred revenue on these government contracts when cash is received. Deferred revenues attributable to government contracts were $47.9 million and $41.7 million at December 31, 2006 and December 31, 2005, respectively. In addition, at December 31, 2006 and December 31, 2005, we had not recognized uncollected receivables or deferred revenues, relating to government contracts that permit termination, of $9.6 million and $7.1 million, respectively. Uncollectible fees receivable The allowance for losses is composed of a bad debt and a sales and allowance reserve. Provisions are charged against earnings. The measurement of likely and probable losses and the allowance for uncollectible fees receivable is based on historical loss experience, aging of outstanding receivables, an assessment of current economic conditions and the financial health of specific clients. This evaluation is inherently judgmental and requires material estimates. These valuation reserves are periodically re-evaluated and adjusted as more information about the ultimate collectibility of fees receivable becomes available. Circumstances that could cause our valuation reserves to increase include changes in our clients liquidity and credit quality, other factors negatively impacting our clients ability to pay their obligations as they come due, and the effectiveness of our collection efforts. The following table provides our total fees receivable, along with the related allowance for losses (in thousands): December 31, 2006 2005 Total fees receivable $ 337,083 $ 321,095 Allowance for losses (8,700 ) (7,900 ) Fees receivable, net $ 328,383 $ 313,195 Impairment of goodwill and other intangible assets The evaluation of goodwill is performed in accordance with Statement of Financial Accounting Standards No. 142, Goodwill and Other Intangible Assets ( SFAS 142 ). Among other requirements, this standard eliminated goodwill amortization upon adoption and requires ongoing annual assessments of goodwill impairment. The evaluation of other intangible assets is performed on a periodic basis. These assessments require management to estimate the fair values of our reporting units based on estimates of future business operations and market and economic conditions in developing long-term forecasts. If we determine that the fair value of any reporting unit is less than its carrying amount, we must recognize an impairment charge, for the associated goodwill of that reporting unit, to earnings in our financial statements. Goodwill is evaluated for impairment at least annually, or whenever events or changes in circumstances indicate that the carrying value may not be recoverable. Factors we consider important that could trigger a review for impairment include the following: Significant under-performance relative to historical or projected future operating results; Significant changes in the manner of our use of acquired assets or the strategy for our overall business; Significant negative industry or economic trends; Significant decline in our stock price for a sustained period; and 16 Table of Contents Our market capitalization relative to net book value. Due to the numerous variables associated with our judgments and assumptions relating to the valuation of the reporting units and the effects of changes in circumstances affecting these valuations, both the precision and reliability of the resulting estimates are subject to uncertainty, and as additional information becomes known, we may change our estimates. During 2004, we recorded an impairment charge of $0.7 million in the first quarter relating to goodwill associated with certain operations in South America that were closed, and in the fourth quarter we recorded a goodwill impairment charge of $2.0 million related to the exit from certain non-core product lines. Accounting for income taxes As we prepare our consolidated financial statements, we estimate our income taxes in each of the jurisdictions where we operate. This process involves estimating our current tax expense together with assessing temporary differences resulting from differing treatment of items for tax and accounting purposes. These differences result in deferred tax assets and liabilities, which are included within our consolidated balance sheets. We record a valuation allowance to reduce our deferred tax assets when future realization is in question. We consider the availability of loss carryovers, existing deferred tax liabilities, future taxable income and ongoing prudent and feasible tax planning strategies in assessing the need for the valuation allowance. In the event we determine that we would be able to realize our deferred tax assets in the future in excess of our net recorded amount, an adjustment to the deferred tax asset would increase income in the period such determination was made. Likewise, should we determine that we would not be able to realize all or part of our net deferred tax asset in the future, an adjustment to the deferred tax asset would be charged against income in the period such determination was made. We operate in numerous foreign taxing jurisdictions and our level of operations and profitability in each jurisdiction could have an impact upon the amount of income taxes that we provide in any given year. In addition, our tax filings for various tax years are subject to audit by the tax authorities in jurisdictions where we conduct business. These audits may result in assessments of additional taxes. We have provided for the amounts we believe will ultimately result from these audits. However, resolution of these matters involves uncertainties and there are no assurances that the ultimate resolution will not exceed the amounts provided. In October 2005 and October 2006 we received IRS Examination Reports showing proposed changes that primarily relate to the valuation of intangible assets licensed to a foreign subsidiary and the calculation of payments under a cost sharing arrangement. The Company appealed the initial findings and has reached an agreement on the issues with IRS Appeals Office. See Item 3. Legal Proceedings for additional information Accounting for stock-based compensation On January 1, 2006, we adopted Statement of Financial Accounting Standards 123(R), Share-Based Payment ( SFAS No. 123(R) ), as interpreted by SEC Staff Accounting Bulletin No. 107 ( SAB No. 107 ). Effective with the adoption of SFAS No. 123(R), the Company is recognizing stock-based compensation expense, which is based on the fair value of the award on the date of grant, over the related service period, net of estimated forfeitures (See Note 10 Stock-Based Compensation in the Notes to the Consolidated Financial Statements). Determining the appropriate fair value model and calculating the fair value of stock compensation awards requires the input of certain highly complex and subjective assumptions, including the expected life of the stock compensation awards and the Company common stock price volatility. In addition, determining the appropriate amount of associated periodic expense requires management to estimate the rate of employee forfeitures and the likelihood of achievement of certain performance targets. The assumptions used in calculating the fair value of stock compensation awards and the associated periodic expense represent management best estimates, but these estimates involve inherent uncertainties and the application of judgment. As a result, if factors change and the Company deems it necessary in the future to modify the assumptions it made or to use different assumptions, or if the quantity and nature of the Company stock-based compensation awards changes, then the amount of expense may need to be adjusted and future stock compensation expense could be materially different from what has been recorded in the current period. Contingencies and other loss reserves and accruals We record accruals for severance costs, lease costs associated with excess facilities, contract terminations and asset impairments as a result of actions we undertake to streamline our organization, reposition certain businesses and reduce ongoing costs. Estimates of costs to be incurred to complete these actions, such as future lease payments, sublease income, the fair value of assets, and severance and related benefits, are based on assumptions at the time the actions are initiated. To the extent actual costs differ from those estimates, reserve levels may need to be adjusted. In addition, these actions may be revised due to changes in business conditions that we did not foresee at the time such plans were approved. During 2005 we revised our previous estimate for costs and losses associated with excess facilities and we recorded a charge of approximately $8.2 million, primarily due to a reduction of office space in San Jose, California, where we consolidated employees from two buildings into one. The charge is included in Other charges. Additionally, we record accruals for estimated incentive compensation costs during each year. Amounts accrued at the end of each reporting period are based on our estimates and may require adjustment as the ultimate amount paid for these incentives are sometimes not known until after year end. RESULTS OF OPERATIONS 2006 VERSUS 2005 revenues increased 7% or $71.3 million, to $1,060.3 million in 2006 from $989.0 million in 2005. 17 Table of Contents Research revenues increased 9% in 2006 to $571.2 million, compared to $523.0 million in 2005, and comprised approximately 54% and 53% of total revenues in 2006 and 2005, respectively. Consulting revenues in 2006 of $305.2 million were up 1% compared to the $301.1 in 2005, and comprised approximately 29% and 30% of total revenues in 2006 and 2005, respectively. Events revenues were $169.4 million in 2006, an increase of 12% from the $151.3 million in 2005, and comprised approximately 16% and 15% of total revenues in 2006 and 2005, respectively. Other revenues, consisting principally of reprint and software licensing fees, increased 6%, to $14.4 million in 2006 from $13.6 million in 2005. Excluding the impact of foreign currency translation, total revenues for 2006 would have increased slightly less than 7%. See the Segment Results section below for a further discussion of segment revenues. Gartner acquired META on April 1, 2005, and as a result Gartner first quarter of 2005 operating results did not contain META. Because META has been completely integrated into Gartner, we cannot approximate the impact on our 2006 results from the acquisition. Revenues increased in all regions. Revenues from sales to United States and Canadian clients increased 3% to $631.3 million in 2006 from $611.0 million in 2005. Revenues from sales to clients in Europe, the Middle East and Africa ( EMEA ) increased 14% to $337.7 million in 2006 from $296.7 million in 2005. Revenues from sales to clients in other international regions increased 12%, to $91.3 million in 2006 from $81.3 million in 2005. Cost of services and product development expense increased $18.7 million, or 4%, to $505.3 million in 2006 from $486.6 million in 2005. Excluding the effects of foreign currency translation, Cost of services and product development expense would have increased 3% for the twelve months ended December 31, 2006. The 4% year-over-year increase in Cost of services and product development expense was primarily due to charges of $8.0 million for stock-based compensation under SFAS No. 123(R), approximately $6.0 million of incremental delivery costs associated with continued growth in our Events business, the inclusion of a full year of salary and benefit expense for former META employees in 2006 compared to nine months in 2005, and higher compensation costs related to merit salary increases. The Company adopted SFAS No. 123(R) on January 1, 2006 under the modified prospective transition method, so the prior year excludes such charges. In addition to these expense increases, Cost of services and product development expense for 2005 benefited from the reversal of $2.1 million of prior year bonus accruals. For 2006 and 2005, Cost of services and product development expense as a percentage of sales was 48% and 49%, respectively. Selling, general and administrative expenses ( SG&A ) increased 5%, or $18.8 million, to $416.1 million in 2006 from $397.3 million in 2005. Excluding the effects of foreign currency translation, SG&A expense would have increased by 4% year-over-year. The 5% increase in SG&A expense on a year-to-date basis resulted primarily from increased investment in our sales organization. We now have 663 sales associates, a 21% increase over the prior year, which added approximately $18.0 million of costs. Also contributing to the increase were charges of $8.7 million for stock-based compensation under SFAS No. 123(R), and increased recruiting and relocation expenses. Offsetting these increases were reductions in a number of G&A expense categories, to include consulting, travel, facilities, and fulfillment. In addition, SG&A expense in 2005 benefited from the reversal of $0.8 million of prior year bonus accruals. Depreciation expense for 2006 decreased 8%, to $23.4 million, compared to $25.5 million for 2005. The reduction is due to a decline in capital spending in both the current and prior periods, reflecting our focus on disciplined capital spending on projects that support our strategic initiatives. Amortization of intangibles was $10.7 million for 2006 and $10.2 million in 2005. Of the $25.6 million of intangibles we recorded related to META, both the intellectual property and database intangibles are now fully amortized, with $5.0 million in customer relationship intangibles remaining to be amortized. meta integration charges were $1.5 million and $15.0 million for 2006 and 2005, respectively. These expenses were primarily for severance, and for consulting, accounting, and tax services, related to our integration of META. The Company will not record any additional META integration charges in 2007 or later. other charges were zero in 2006 and $29.1 million in 2005. The 2005 charges consisted of $10.6 million of employee severance costs, $8.2 million of charges mostly related to excess office space, $6.0 million related to an option buyback, and $4.3 million primarily for restructuring in our international operations. loss on investments, net was zero and $5.8 million for 2006 and 2005, respectively. The 2005 loss was primarily due to the writedown of an investment in a venture capital fund to its net realizable value. The investment was sold in late 2005 at book value. As of December 31, 2006, we had approximately $0.3 million of investments. 18 Table of Contents interest expense, net was $16.6 million and $11.1 million for 2006 and 2005, respectively, a $5.5 million increase. The increase was primarily related to an increase in rates and an increase in the amount of debt outstanding, and to a lesser extent higher amortization and writeoff of debt issue costs. The weighted-average interest rate on our debt was 6.3% in 2006 compared to 4.9% in the prior year. In addition, the weighted-average debt outstanding was about $5.0 million higher in 2006 compared to 2005. other expense, net for both 2006 and 2005 consists primarily of net foreign currency exchange gains and losses. provision (benefit) for income taxes was $27.7 million for 2006 compared to $7.9 million for 2005. The effective tax rate was 32.2% and 144.8% for 2006 and 2005, respectively. The lower effective tax rate in 2006 as compared to 2005 is attributable to several items. The most significant of those items include the following: (a) the Company generated more income in low tax jurisdictions in 2006 as compared to 2005, and (b) 2006 included a significant decrease in valuation allowances for state and local net operating losses due to expected utilization as a result of legal entity restructuring while 2005 included a significant increase in valuation allowances for foreign tax credits. The impact of these items is partially offset by: (a) benefits taken to reduce overall tax expense in 2005 relating to repatriated earnings, no such items occurred in 2006, (b) larger benefits taken in 2005 as compared to 2006 for foreign tax credits generated, and (c) an overall increase in reserve needs in 2006 as compared to an overall decrease in 2005. Note that the impact of the various positive and negative adjustments is amplified by lower pretax book income in 2005 as compared to 2006. In March 2005, we repatriated approximately $52.0 million in cash from our non-US subsidiaries. Also in 2005, we took into account technical corrections issued by the Treasury Department related to repatriating earnings under the American Jobs Creation Act (AJCA). As a result of favorable provisions in the technical corrections, we realized a tax benefit of $3.6 million in 2005 that reduced the cumulative charge on the repatriated earnings to $1.4 million. In addition, as a consequence of the application of the technical corrections, we re-evaluated our ability to use foreign tax credits in the future and took a charge of $2.5 million to re-establish valuation allowance for foreign tax credits that will more likely than not expire unused. Upon filing our 2005 income tax return in 2006, the Company determined that it would be more beneficial not to avail itself of the provision of the AJCA with respect to the taxation of the repatriation. Therefore, the repatriation was partially taxed as an ordinary dividend and partially as a tax-free return of capital under existing tax law. Excluding the impact of SFAS No. 123(R), amortization of certain intangibles acquired as part of the META acquisition and various META integration charges, the effective tax rate was 32.4% for 2006. Excluding the impact of the amortization of certain intangibles acquired as part of the META acquisition, various META integration charges and certain one-time charges for facility closures and capital asset impairments, the effective tax rate was 36.6% for 2005, respectively. The lower effective tax rate in 2006 as compared to 2005 is attributable to several items. The most significant of those items include the following: (a) the Company generated more income in low tax jurisdictions in 2006 as compared to 2005, and (b) 2006 included a significant decrease in valuation allowances for state and local net operating losses while 2005 included a significant increase in valuation allowances for foreign tax credits. The impact of these items is partially offset by (a) benefits taken to reduce overall tax expense in 2005 relating to repatriated earnings, no such items occurred in 2006, (b) larger benefits taken in 2005 as compared to 2006 for foreign tax credits generated, and (c) an overall increase in reserve needs in 2006 as compared to an overall decrease in 2005. Note that the impact of the various positive and negative adjustments is amplified by lower pretax book income in 2005 as compared to 2006. 2005 VERSUS 2004 revenues increased 11%, or $95.2 million, to $989.0 million during 2005 from $893.8 million during 2004. Research revenues increased 9% in 2005 to $523.0 million, compared to $480.5 million in 2004, and comprised approximately 53% and 54% of total revenues in 2005 and 2004, respectively. Consulting revenues in 2005 of $301.1 million were up 16% compared to the $259.4 in 2004, and comprised approximately 30% and 29% of total revenues in 2005 and 2004, respectively. Events revenues were $151.3 million in 2005, an increase of 9% from the $138.4 million in 2004, and comprised approximately 15% of total revenues in both periods. Other revenues, consisting principally of reprint and software licensing fees, decreased 13% to $13.6 million in 2005 from $15.5 million in 2004. The effects of foreign currency translation had approximately a $1.1 million negative effect on total revenues for 2005 compared to 2004, while the META purchase added approximately $50.0 million of revenue. Excluding the effects of foreign currency translation and the META acquisition, revenues would have increased approximately 5% year-over-year. See the Segment Results section below for a further discussion of segment revenues. Revenues increased in all regions. Revenues from sales to United States and Canadian clients increased 9% to $611.0 million in 2005 from $559.4 million in 2004. Revenues from sales to clients in Europe, the Middle East and Africa ( EMEA ) increased 13% to $296.7 million in 2005 from $263.0 million in 2004. Revenues from sales to clients in other international regions increased 14% to $81.3 million in 2005 from $71.4 million in 2004. 19 Table of Contents Cost of services and product development expense increased $52.1 million, or 12%, to $486.6 million in 2005 from $434.5 million in 2004, with foreign currency translation having a negligible impact. The increase in Cost of services and product development expense on a year-to-date basis resulted primarily from an increase in salary and benefits expense of approximately $33.5 million, primarily driven by the addition of 140 people related to the META purchase, and higher bonus expense and sales commissions of $14.2 million and $5.0 million, respectively. The increase in bonus expense reflects the Company decision to restore bonus payouts to a competitive level. In addition, we had $5.3 million of higher conference expenses related to an increase in the number of events and attendees. Cost of services and product development expense in 2005 benefited by the reversal of $2.1 million of prior years bonus accruals. Additionally, Cost of services and product development expense during 2004 benefited by the reversal of $3.5 million of prior years incentive compensation program accruals. For 2005 and 2004, Cost of services and product development expense as a percentage of sales was 49% for both periods. Selling, general and administrative expense increased $47.4 million, or 14%, to $397.3 million in 2005 from $349.8 million in 2004, with foreign currency translation having a negligible impact. The increase in SG&A expense on a year-to-date basis was primarily driven by our continued investment in our sales organization. We added over 110 new sales associates in 2005, which includes 80 from META. We added 111 people related to the META purchase, including the 80 sales associates, accounting for approximately $10.7 million of the increase. In addition to the $10.7 million increase attributable to META, other salary and benefit increases totaled $12.1 million, while bonus expense and sales commissions increased by $6.9 million and $7.0 million, respectively. Also, we had approximately $16.4 million of additional external consulting, facilities, outsourcing, and other charges. These charges were offset by the favorable impact of approximately $4.4 million of lower costs, primarily marketing, and production. SG&A expense in 2005 benefited by the reversal of $0.9 million of prior years incentive compensation program accruals. During 2004, SG&A expense benefited by the reversal of $3.3 million of prior year incentive compensation program accruals. During 2004 the Company reduced its allowance for doubtful accounts by $3.7 million as a result of increased collections and a decline in write-offs. Depreciation expense for 2005 decreased 8% to $25.5 million, compared to $27.6 million for 2004. The reduction is due to a decline in capital spending, reflecting our disciplined capital spending on projects that support our strategic initiatives. Amortization of intangibles increased to $10.2 million in 2005 from $0.7 million in the prior year due to the amortization of the $25.6 million of intangibles acquired in the META acquisition. goodwill impairments were $2.7 million in 2004, reflecting the write-off of $0.7 million of goodwill related to the closing of certain operations in Latin America and $2.0 million related to the exit from certain non-core product lines. meta integration charges was $15.0 million in 2005. These expenses were primarily for severance, and for consulting, accounting, and tax services, related to our integration of META. other charges during 2005 were $29.2 million, which includes $10.7 million related to workforce reductions, $6.0 million for an option buyback, $8.2 million related to a reduction in office space, and $4.3 million of other charges. The Company severed a total of 150 employees in 2005 and estimates the annualized savings from the termination of these employees to be approximately $15.2 million. The Company has reinvested a significant portion of these savings into improving its products, processes, and infrastructure to help drive future growth. Other charges during 2004 were $35.8 million. Included in this amount was $29.7 million related to severance and benefits for approximately 200 employees. During 2004, the Company also revised its estimate of previously recorded costs and losses associated with excess facilities and recorded $2.3 million of additional provisions. The revised estimate was due to a decline in market lease rates for expected subleases, as well as a reduction in estimated periods of subleases. The Company also recorded charges in 2004 of $1.9 million related to the restructuring of certain internal systems, and $1.8 million for charges related to the exit from certain international and other non-core operations. loss on investments, net was $5.8 million and $3.0 million for 2005 and 2004, respectively. These losses were primarily for writedowns of the Company investments in venture capital funds. other expense, net for 2005 of $2.9 million consists primarily of net foreign currency exchange gains and losses. Other (expense), net of $3.9 million in 2004 includes the non-cash write-off of $3.1 million of accumulated foreign currency translation adjustments associated with certain of our operations in South America that we closed. As a result of this decision we were required to reclassify these currency adjustments that have been accumulated within equity to earnings, in accordance with Statement of Financial Accounting Standards No. 52 Foreign Currency Translation. provision for income taxes was 144.8% and 51.0% of income before income taxes for 2005 and 2004, respectively. The increase in the effective tax rate for 2005, as compared to that of 2004, is principally due to the fact that the Company generated less income in low tax jurisdictions as compared to the prior year and recorded valuation allowances against capital losses and foreign tax credit carryforwards. The impact of these items is offset, in part, by benefits taken to reduce the overall tax expense on repatriated earnings as well as reductions for interest costs related to tax contingencies. The impact of the various positive and negative adjustments is amplified by lower pretax book income in 2005 as compared to 2004. 20 Table of Contents Excluding the effect of certain one-time charges, the provision for income taxes for the years ended 2005 and 2004 would have been 36.6% and 36.0% respectively. In 2005, the most significant of these one-time charges included expenses related to the acquisition and integration of META, various capital losses and impairments, charges associated with the buy-back of under water stock options, and severance and facilities reduction charges. In 2004, the most significant of these one-time charges included nondeductible goodwill impairment, the write-off of accumulated foreign currency translation adjustments associated with certain South American operations, various capital losses and impairments, and severance and facilities reduction charges. In 2004, we took a $5.0 million tax charge in anticipation of repatriating approximately $52.0 million in earnings from our non-US subsidiaries in 2005. The repatriation was expected to qualify for a one-time reduced tax rate pursuant to the American Jobs Creation Act (AJCA). The charge was partially offset by a benefit of $2.5 million to the release of a valuation allowance on foreign tax credits that was expected to be utilized before they expired. In March 2005, we repatriated approximately $52.0 million in cash from our non-US subsidiaries. Also in 2005, we took into account technical corrections issued by the Treasury Department related to repatriating earnings under the AJCA. As a result of favorable provisions in the technical corrections, we realized a tax benefit of $3.6 million in 2005 that reduced the cumulative charge on the repatriated earnings to $1.4 million. In addition, as a consequence of the application of the technical corrections, we re-evaluated our ability to use foreign tax credits in the future and took a charge of $2.5 million to re-establish valuation allowances for foreign tax credits that will more likely than not expire unused. 2006 SEGMENT RESULTS We evaluate reportable segment performance and allocate resources based on gross contribution margin. Gross contribution is defined as operating income excluding certain Cost of services and product development expense and SG & A expense, depreciation, META integration charges, amortization of intangibles and Other charges. Gross contribution margin is defined as gross contribution as a percentage of revenues. Research We had strong revenue performance in our Research segment in 2006, with revenue up 9%, to $571.2 million, from $523.0 in 2005. Foreign currency had an immaterial impact on revenue for the year. The revenue growth for the year was across all of our regions and client sectors, as well as across the entire client portfolio. Both client and wallet retention rates remain strong. At December 31, 2006, our research client retention rate was 81%, the same rate as of December 31, 2005. Wallet retention was up 3 points from the prior year, to 96% at December 31, 2006, from 93% at December 31, 2005. Our Executive Program membership was 3,646 at December 31, 2006, compared to 3,522 at the prior year end. Research gross contribution of $345.5 million for 2006 increased 11% from the $310.0 million in 2005, while gross contribution margin increased 1 point in 2006 to 60%, from 59% in the prior year. The improvement in the contribution margin was mainly due to operating leverage resulting from the strong revenue performance. For 2006, SFAS No. 123(R) decreased gross contribution margin in the Research segment by about 1 point. Contract value at December 31, 2006 was the highest in the Company history, at $640.3 million, up 8% over the prior year value of $592.6 million. Excluding the impact of foreign currency, contract value increased by approximately 11%. Contract value has now increased for 12 consecutive quarters. The increase was driven by growth in both core research and Executive Programs. Consulting Consulting revenues increased 1%, to $305.2 million in 2006 as compared to the $301.1 million in 2005. With a strong emphasis on growing the Research and Events segments, coupled with a change in sales incentives for the success-fee portion of the Consulting segment, growth slowed from the first half of 2006. Excluding the impact of foreign currency translation, revenues were up slightly less than 1%. The year-over-year revenue increase reflects increases in annualized revenue per billable headcount, billing rate, and consultant utilization. Billable headcount was 514 at December 31, 2006, compared to 525 for the prior year, a decline of 2%. Consultant utilization rates were 64% and 62% for 2006 and 2005, respectively. The billing rate remained at over $300 per hour in 2006, while the average annualized revenue per billable headcount was approximately $390,000. Consulting gross contribution of $120.7 million for 2006 decreased 4% from the $125.7 million in 2005, while the contribution margin for 2006 decreased to 40%, from 42% in the prior year. The margin decline was primarily due to costs related to SFAS No. 123(R), costs related to exiting less profitable geographies, and investments made in senior level hires related to our growth strategy. The impact of SFAS No. 123(R), which we adopted on January 1, 2006, decreased gross contribution margin in the Consulting segment for 2006 by approximately half a point. 21 Table of Contents Consulting backlog, which represents future revenues to be recognized from in-process consulting, measurement and SAS, was $109.6 million at December 31, 2006, compared to $107.7 million at September 30, 2006 and $119.9 million at December 31, 2005. Events Events revenues in 2006 were up 12%, or $18.1 million, to $169.4 million from $151.3 million in the prior year. We held 74 events in 2006 with over 41,000 attendees compared to 70 events in 2005 with over 35,000 attendees. The increase in revenue was due to new events as well as strong performance from our on-going events. We had 11 new events in 2006 which had higher revenues than the events that were eliminated, while revenue from existing events was up 7%, reflecting underlying strength in our on-going Summit events. Excluding the impact of foreign currency translation, Events revenues were up approximately 11% in 2006. Events gross contribution was $83.7 million, or 49% of revenues, for 2006, compared to $76.1 million, or 50% of revenues, for 2005. The decrease in gross contribution margin was primarily due to the mix of new events and existing events. SFAS No. 123(R) had an immaterial impact on the Events gross contribution margin for 2006. 2005 SEGMENT RESULTS We evaluate reportable segment performance and allocate resources based on gross contribution margin. Gross contribution is defined as operating income excluding certain Cost of services and product development expense and SG & A expenses, depreciation, META integration charges, amortization of intangibles and Other charges. Gross contribution margin is defined as gross contribution as a percentage of revenues. Research Research revenues increased 9%, or $42.5 million, when comparing 2005 and 2004, with META contributing approximately $29.0 million, and growth in our Executive Programs accounting for the majority of the rest of the increase. The impact of foreign currency was immaterial. Excluding the impact of META and foreign currency, revenue was up 3%. Research gross contribution of $310.0 million for 2005 increased from the $292.7 million for 2004, while the gross contribution margin for 2005 decreased to 59% from 61% in the prior year. The decrease in the gross contribution margin in 2005 was primarily due to increased revenues from our Executive Programs, which have lower margins than our core subscription products, an increase in compensation costs, mostly due to headcount related to the META acquisition, and the impact of converting META contract value to Gartner contract value. As of December 31, 2005, we had transacted on approximately 95% of the META contract value. Research contract value, an indicator of future research revenue, was $592.6 million at December 31, 2005, an increase of 16%, or $83.4 million, from $509.2 million at December 31, 2004. Approximately half of the increase in contract value is attributable to the META acquisition. Excluding the impact of foreign currency, contract value increased by approximately 13%. The research contract value of $592.6 million at December 31, 2005 represented our highest reported contract value since September 30, 2000. At December 31, 2005, our research client retention rate increased 1 percentage point to 81% from 80% at December 31, 2004, while our wallet retention rate was 93% compared to 95% at December 31, 2004. Our Executive Program membership was 3,522 at December 31, 2005, up 18% from 2,975 at December 31, 2004, which is attributed to new business growth in North America and EMEA, as well as improved renewal rates and clients obtained as a result of the META acquisition. As of December 31, 2005, our Executive Program membership remained the largest in our industry and had almost doubled in the last three years. Consulting Consulting revenues of $301.1 million for 2005 were up 16%, or $41.7 million, when compared to the $259.4 million in 2004, with META contributing approximately $18.0 million of the revenue growth. The revenue increase reflects strong organic growth in our core consulting services as well as in the performance-fee portion of our consulting business. The increase in the performance-fee business for 2005 includes revenues that the Company did not expect to close until the first quarter of 2006, and as a result our margin for that quarter will be impacted. The growth in our core consulting services reflects our continuing execution of our strategy of focusing on fewer accounts, attracting larger deals through integrated solutions, and enhancing engagement profitability through improved resource management. Revenue in 2005 increased despite our exit from certain less profitable consulting practices and geographies in 2004. The effect of foreign currency exchange rates reduced revenues by approximately 1%. Excluding the impact of META and foreign currency, revenue was up 11%. Consulting gross contribution of $125.7 million for 2005 increased significantly from the prior year, up 36% from the $92.7 million for 2004, primarily due to higher profitability per engagement, as well as the impact of the timing of performance-fees discussed above. Gross contribution margin for 2005 increased to 42% from 36% in the prior year. Consulting utilization rates were 62% during 2005 as compared to 63% during 2004, while our billable rate was over $300 per hour for both 2005 and 2004. Our billable headcount increased to 525 at December 31, 2005 as compared to 475 at December 31, 2004, an 11% increase, primarily related to consultants from the META acquisition. Our average annualized revenue per billable headcount was approximately $390,000 in 2005 compared to $342,000 in 2004. Consulting backlog, which represents future revenues to be recognized from in-process consulting, measurement and SAS, increased 7%, or $8.1 million, to $119.9 million at December 31, 2005, compared to $111.8 million at December 31, 2004. 22 Table of Contents Events. Events revenues increased 9%, or $12.9 million, to $151.3 million for 2005, compared to $138.4 million for 2004, with approximately $2.4 million of the increase related to META. Changes in foreign currency exchange rates had a negligible effect on revenues when comparing 2005 to 2004. Excluding META and foreign currency, revenue was up 8%. The revenue increase was primarily due to an increase in the number of events, to 70 for 2005 compared to 56 in the prior year period, as we added 15 new events in new topic areas and geographies. Revenue increased to a lesser extent due to continued performance from our recurring events, for which revenue was up about 5% year over year. The number of attendees at our Events increased by about 14% in 2005 compared to 2004, rising to 35,502 from 31,223, respectively. Gross contribution of $76.1 million for 2005 was 9.6% higher than the $69.5 million recorded in 2004. As a percentage of revenues, gross contribution was 50% during 2005 and 2004. Since new events typically run at lower margins in their first year of existence, the 15 new events we launched in 2005 had slightly lower margins than existing events. However, in addition to launching these new events, we continued to rationalize our existing portfolio by exiting from events that no longer met our profit targets. As a result of this active portfolio management, we were able to deliver a flat contribution margin year-over-year. LIQUIDITY AND CAPITAL RESOURCES 2006 Cash provided by operating activities totaled $106.3 million for the twelve months ended December 31, 2006, compared to $27.1 million in the prior year period. The increase in cash flow from operating activities of $79.2 million was primarily due to an increase in cash from core operations of approximately $50.0 million. The improved cash flow also reflects lower cash payments for severance and other charges of about $21.0 million, as well as a decrease of $28.0 million of payments related to the integration of META. These improvements were somewhat offset by higher cash payments for bonus, and to a lesser extent, interest and other items. Cash used in investing activities was $21.8 million for 2006, compared to $181.0 million in the prior year period. The decrease in cash used was primarily due to the net expenditure of $161.3 million for the acquisition of META in 2005. Capital expenditures of $21.1 million was down about $1.2 million from the prior year period, reflecting the Company continued focus on disciplined capital spending. Cash used by financing activities totaled $91.5 million in 2006, compared to $70.0 million of cash provided in the twelve months ended December 31, 2005. The decline in cash provided was due to the repurchase of $270.7 million of our common shares in 2006, which includes $200.0 million repurchased directly from Silver Lake in December 2006, for which we borrowed an additional $190.0 million and utilized $10.0 million of existing cash. During 2005 we had $9.6 million of common share repurchases. We borrowed additional amounts in both 2006 and 2005, and our outstanding debt increased by about $123.0 million in 2006 compared to an increase of approximately $56.0 million in the prior year. We realized about $15.7 million more in cash from stock issued under stock plans during 2006, with $46.7 million of proceeds in 2006 compared to $31.0 million during the prior year period. The increase was a result of our higher stock price during 2006 as compared to 2005, which resulted in more stock option exercises by employees in 2006. We also had $9.2 million in excess tax benefits from stock-based compensation awards under SFAS No. 123(R). At December 31, 2006, cash and cash equivalents totaled $67.8 million. The effect of exchange rates increased cash and cash equivalents by about $4.6 million during 2006. 2005 Cash provided by operating activities totaled $27.1 million for 2005, compared to $48.2 million for the prior year, a $21.1 million decline. The net decrease in cash flow from operating activities was due primarily to the payment of $35.0 million of META integration payments, higher employee salary costs, primarily related to higher headcount due to the acquisition of META, and to a lesser extent, a shift in the mix of our products in the Research segment from higher margin core research to lower margin Executive Programs. Offsetting these decreases was a $12.0 million reduction in bonus payments and a decline of approximately $10.0 million in severance and related payments. Cash used in investing activities increased to $181.0 million during 2005 as compared to $29.0 million in the prior year, primarily due to the acquisition of META, which was completed on April 1, 2005. The Company net cash investment in META was approximately $176.4 million of cash paid, including transaction costs, less the $15.1 million acquired from META. Offsetting the cash paid for META was a decline in capital expenditures, which decreased $2.7 million for 2005 as compared to 2004, and $2.1 million in cash received from the sale of the Company investment in SI II and other investments. Cash provided by financing activities totaled $70.0 million for 2005, compared to $97.2 million of cash used for 2004. The increase was primarily driven by the borrowing of additional debt in 2005 and cash used in 2004 for stock repurchases. We had an additional $56.7 million of debt at December 31, 2005 compared to the prior year end. During 2005, we borrowed $327.0 million and we repaid $271.3 million. We borrowed $250.0 million on June 29, 2005 related to the refinancing of our debt, $67.0 million in April under the revolver related to the META acquisition, and $10.0 million under the revolver. Of the $271.3 million repaid during 2005, we paid $247.0 million on June 29, 2005 related to the refinancing, we made $23.4 million in quarterly debt payments, and we paid 23 Table of Contents $0.9 million for a note payable we acquired in the META acquisition. We also paid $1.1 million in debt issue costs during the second quarter of 2005 related to the refinancing of our debt. We received proceeds from stock issued for stock plans of $31.0 million during 2005 as compared to $67.9 million in the prior year as a result of our higher stock price during 2004 as compared to 2005, which resulted in more stock option exercises by employees in 2004. The Company used $6.0 million of cash, including expenses, to buy back employee stock options in the third and fourth quarters of 2005. In the fourth quarter of 2005 we used $9.6 million of cash to repurchase our stock, while in 2004 we used $346.1 million of cash for a stock tender offer and $6.1 million of cash for treasury stock purchases. At December 31, 2005, cash and cash equivalents totaled $70.2 million. The effect of exchange rates decreased cash and cash equivalents by approximately $6.0 million during 2005. OBLIGATIONS AND COMMITMENTS On January 31, 2007, the Company entered into a new credit arrangement that provides for a five-year, $180.0 million term loan and a $300.0 million revolving credit facility, which may be increased, at Gartner option, by up to an additional $100.0 million, for a total revolving credit facility of $400.0 million. The Company also drew down $190.0 million from the revolving facility and $180.0 million from the term loan facility and repaid the $370.0 million outstanding under its existing facilities. The term loan will be repaid in 18 consecutive quarterly installments commencing September 30, 2007, plus a final payment due on January 31, 2012, and may be prepaid at any time without penalty or premium at the option of Gartner. The revolving credit facility may be used for loans, and up to $15.0 million may be used for letters of credit. The revolving loans may be borrowed, repaid and reborrowed until January 31, 2012, at which time all amounts borrowed must be repaid. In conjunction with the new arrangement the existing facilities were terminated. We believe that our existing cash balances, together with cash from our operating activities and the additional borrowing capacity under our amended five-year revolving credit facility, will be sufficient for our expected short-term and foreseeable long-term needs. The following table represents our contractual cash commitments (in thousands) due after December 31, 2006. The table excludes required interest payments under our credit facility: Less Than 1 - 3 4 - 5 More Than Total 1 Year Years Years 5 Years Operating leases (1) $ 204,800 $ 36,000 $ 56,100 $ 38,100 $ 74,600 Debt (2) 370,000 20,000 80,000 80,000 190,000 Deferred compensation arrangement (3) 19,100 1,700 3,600 3,500 10,300 Other 700 700 Totals $ 594,600 $ 58,400 $ 139,700 $ 121,600 $ 274,900 (1) The Company leases various facilities, furniture, and computer equipment expiring between 2007 and 2025.

In 2005, the Company recorded META integration charges of $3.4 million in the first quarter, $8.2 million in the second quarter, $2.0 million in the third quarter and $1.3 million in the fourth quarter. (2) The aggregate of the four quarters basic and diluted earnings per common share may not equal the reported full calendar amounts due to the effects of dilutive securities and rounding. (3) In 2005 the Company recorded Other charges of $14.3 million in the first quarter, $8.2 million in the second quarter, $6.0 million in the third quarter, and $0.7 million in the fourth quarter. (4) In 2005 the Company recorded losses on investments of $5.1 million, $0.2 million, and $0.5 million in the first, second and fourth quarters, respectively. (5) During the first quarter of 2005 we recorded an adjustment for certain prior year incentive compensation accruals, including bonuses, which provided a benefit to operating income of approximately $2.9 million. RECENTLY ISSUED ACCOUNTING STANDARDS In September 2006, the SEC staff issued Staff Accounting Bulletin No. 108, Considering the Effects of Prior Year Misstatements when Quantifying Misstatements in Current Year Financial Statements ( SAB No. 108 ). This SAB provides guidance on the consideration of the effects of prior year misstatements in quantifying current year misstatements for the purpose of a materiality assessment. SAB No. 108 establishes an approach that requires quantification of financial statement errors based on the effects on each of the Company financial statements and related financial statement disclosures. The SAB permits existing public companies to record the cumulative effect of initially applying this approach in the first year ending after November 15, 2006 by recording the necessary correcting adjustments to the carrying values of assets and liabilities as of the beginning of that year with the offsetting adjustment recorded to the opening balance of retained earnings. Additionally, the use of the cumulative effect transition method requires detailed disclosure of the nature and amount of each individual error being corrected through the cumulative adjustment and how and when it arose. The Company has recorded adjustments under SAB No. 108 effective the beginning of the 2006 fiscal year (see Note 2 Adoption of SEC Staff Accounting Bulletin No. 108 in the Notes to the Consolidated Financial Statements). In June 2006, the FASB ratified the consensus reached on Emerging Issues Task Force (EITF) Issue No. 06-03, How Sales Taxes Collected from Customers and Remitted to Governmental Authorities Should Be Presented in the Income Statement (that is, Gross Versus Net Presentation) ( EITF 06-03 ). The EITF reached a consensus that the presentation of taxes on either a gross or net basis is an accounting policy decision that requires disclosure. EITF 06-03 is effective for the first interim or annual reporting period beginning after December 15, 2006. The Company policy is to present taxes on a net basis and as a result the adoption of EITF 06-03 will not have any effect on the Company financial position or results of operations. In July 2006, the FASB issued FASB Interpretation No. 48, Accounting for Uncertainty in Income Taxes an interpretation of FASB Statement No. 109 ( FIN 48 ), which will become effective for the Company on January 1, 2007. The Interpretation prescribes a recognition threshold and a measurement attribute for the financial statement recognition and measurement of tax positions taken or expected to be taken in a tax return. For any benefit to be recognized, a tax position must be more-likely-than-not to be sustained upon examination by taxing authorities. If a position meets the more-likely-than-not threshold, the amount recognized is measured as the largest amount of benefit that is greater than 50 percent likely of being realized upon ultimate settlement. The FASB is expected to give additional guidance regarding the meaning of ultimate settlement. This guidance could have an impact on whether certain reserves related to the ongoing IRS appeals case are released through retained earnings upon adoption of FIN 48 or through current earnings in a later period. While the Company analysis of the final impact of FIN 48 is not yet complete, its best estimate is that it will increase retained earnings at January 1, 2007, by less than $6.0 million. In September 2006, the FASB issued SFAS No. 157, Fair Value Measurements ( SFAS No. 157 ), which establishes a framework for measuring fair value in generally accepted accounting principles, and expands disclosures about fair value measurements. The statement applies under other accounting pronouncements that require or permit fair value measurements.
