ITEM 7. MANAGEMENT S DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS OF FINANCIAL CONDITION AND RESULTS OF OPERATIONS Management Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations ( MD&A ) is intended to facilitate an understanding of our business and results of operations. This MD&A should be read in conjunction with our Consolidated Financial Statements and the accompanying Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements included elsewhere in this report. This report, including the following MD&A, contains forward-looking statements regarding future events or trends as described more fully under Forward-Looking Statements on page 65 of this report. Actual results or developments could differ materially from those projected in such statements as a result of the risk factors described in Item 1a, Risk Factors, of this report. Overview Business Description We are primarily engaged in developing, acquiring, owning and operating apartment communities in high barrier-to-entry markets of the United States. We seek to create long-term shareholder value by accessing capital on cost effective terms; deploying that capital to develop, redevelop and acquire apartment communities in high barrier-to-entry markets; operating apartment communities; and selling communities when they no longer meet our long-term investment strategy or when pricing is attractive. We believe that apartment communities present an attractive long-term investment opportunity compared to other real estate investments because a broad potential resident base should help reduce demand volatility over a real estate cycle. We intend to continue to pursue real estate investments in markets where constraints to new supply exist, and where new rental household formations are expected to out-pace multifamily permit activity over the course of the real estate cycle. Barriers-to-entry in our markets generally include a difficult and lengthy entitlement process with local jurisdictions and dense urban or suburban areas where zoned and entitled land is in limited supply. We regularly evaluate the allocation of our investments by the amount of invested capital and by product type within our individual markets, which are located in the Northeast, Mid-Atlantic, Midwest, Pacific Northwest, and Northern and Southern California regions of the United States. Our strategy is to more deeply penetrate these markets with a broad range of products and services and an intense focus on our customer. A substantial majority of our communities are upscale, which generally command among the highest rents in their markets. However, we also pursue the ownership and operation of apartment communities that target a variety of customer segments and price points, consistent with our goal of offering a broad range of products and services. We believe that, over an entire real estate cycle, lower housing affordability and the limited new supply of apartment homes in our markets will result in a higher propensity to rent and larger revenue and cash flow increases relative to other markets. However, throughout the real estate cycle, apartment market fundamentals, and therefore operating cash flows, are affected by overall economic conditions. A number of our markets experienced economic contraction due to job losses in 2002 and 2003, resulting in a prolonged period of weak apartment market fundamentals (i.e., the ratio of demand, including from new renter household formations, to supply) as reflected in declining rental revenue and demand. However, 2004 was a year of transition with apartment fundamentals further improving in 2005 and 2006. The economic upturn, as evidenced by job growth and declining unemployment claims, and modest increases in net supply, are contributing to the current strong apartment market fundamentals. 49 Financial Highlights and Outlook Strong apartment fundamentals in 2006 were evidenced by the year-over-year rental revenue growth of 6.8% achieved within our Established Community portfolio (as defined later in this report) during the year ended December 31, 2006, comprised of an increase in rental rates of 6.3% and an increase in occupancy of 0.5%. This revenue growth combined with constrained expense growth contributed to our Established Community portfolio achieving year-over-year growth in net operating income ( NOI ) of 9.1% in 2006. For the fourth quarter of 2006, our Established Communities experienced an increase in rental revenue of 7.4% and a corresponding increase in NOI of 10.9% over the prior year period, our strongest operating performance since 2001. We expect the positive revenue and net operating income growth of Established Communities to continue in 2007 but at a more moderate pace. Modest net new supply, low home affordability and continued but moderating job growth should support favorable apartment fundamentals. We expect modest increases in net rental supply in our markets in 2007 that will remain below the national average. The single-family housing market continues to moderate, such that the increase in home prices is flat or down and for-sale inventory has increased. However, the current gap between the cost to rent and the cost to own continues to make rental apartments an economically attractive housing alternative in our markets. These recent trends increase the likelihood that potential home buyers will extend the period they rent a home. Finally, we expect that job growth will continue in our markets, however, at a more modest rate in 2007. Accordingly, we expect apartment market fundamentals to remain strong in our markets such that apartment rental demand will outpace new supply. Our current financial outlook provides for rental revenue growth of 5.0% to 6.5% in our Established Community portfolio in 2007, and projected NOI growth of 5.5% to 7.5%. In positioning for future growth, we have increased our development activity and our investments in Development Rights, as discussed below. We currently have in excess of $1,300,000,000 under construction (measured by total projected capitalized cost of the communities at completion, including the portions in which joint venture partners hold an equity or economic interest). For 2007, we expect additional new development activity to be in the range of $1,000,000,000 to $1,300,000,000. In addition, we continue to secure new Development Rights, including the acquisition of land for future development. We currently have Development Rights for construction of new apartment communities that, based on total projected capitalized cost if developed as expected, total approximately $3,600,000,000. We continue to look for opportunities to acquire existing communities through our investment in and management of a discretionary investment fund (the Fund ), in which the Company holds an interest of approximately 15%. During its investment period (which will end on or before March 16, 2008), the Fund will be our principal vehicle for acquiring apartment communities, subject to certain exceptions. The Fund acquired five communities for an aggregate purchase price of $223,670,000 during 2006 and has approximately $115,000,000 under contract for acquisition in early 2007. As of January 31, 2007, the total amount invested by the Fund is $514,000,000. We expect the Fund to continue to focus on acquisition opportunities where value can be created, generally through redevelopment, repositioning and market cycle timing opportunities. Real estate capital flows remain strong, with income investors seeking to acquire existing apartment communities. As a result, opportunities to realize value upon disposition have continued to be available. In 2006, we sold four communities (one through a joint venture ) for an aggregate sales price of $261,850,000 resulting in a gain in accordance with GAAP of $104,020,000. We expect asset sales of approximately $150,000,000 to $200,000,000 in 2007. For new development, the slowing for-sale market has resulted in increased investment opportunities. We are being selective in pursuing these opportunities, given continued high land prices and construction costs. In addition, we are seeing greater availability of experienced subcontractors and development and construction professionals as a result of slowing construction in both the condominium and single-family housing markets. These positives are somewhat offset by higher construction and development costs. Communities Overview Our real estate investments consist primarily of current operating apartment communities, communities in various stages of development ( Development Communities ) and Development Rights (i.e., land or options to purchase land held for development), as further described in Item 2 of this report. 50 Our current operating communities are further distinguished as Established Communities, Other Stabilized Communities, Lease-Up Communities and Redevelopment Communities. Established Communities are generally operating communities that are consolidated for financial reporting purposes and were owned and had stabilized occupancy and operating expenses as of the beginning of the prior year, which allows the performance of these communities and the markets in which they are located to be compared and monitored between years. Other Stabilized Communities are generally all other operating communities that have stabilized occupancy and operating expenses during the current year, but had not achieved stabilization as of the beginning of the prior year. Lease-Up Communities consist of communities where construction is complete but stabilization has not been achieved. Redevelopment Communities consist of communities where substantial redevelopment is in progress or is planned to begin during the current year. A more detailed description of our reportable segments and other related operating information can be found in Note 9, Segment Reporting, of our Consolidated Financial Statements. Although each of these categories is important to our business, we generally evaluate overall operating, industry and market trends based on the operating results of Established Communities, for which a detailed discussion can be found in Results of Operations as part of our discussion of overall operating results. We evaluate our current and future cash needs and future operating potential based on acquisition, disposition, development, redevelopment and financing activities within Other Stabilized, Redevelopment and Development Communities, and discussions related to these segments of our business can be found in Liquidity and Capital Resources. The net operating income of our current operating communities, as defined later in this report, is one of the financial measures that we use to evaluate community performance. Net operating income is affected by the demand and supply dynamics within our markets, our rental rates and occupancy levels, and our ability to control operating costs. Our overall financial performance is also impacted by the general availability and cost of capital and the performance of newly developed and acquired apartment communities. As of December 31, 2006, we owned or held a direct or indirect ownership interest in 167 apartment communities containing 48,294 apartment homes in ten states and the District of Columbia, of which 17 communities were under construction and six communities were under reconstruction. In addition, we owned a direct or indirect ownership interest in Development Rights to develop an additional 54 communities that, if developed in the manner expected, will contain an estimated 14,185 apartment homes. Critical Accounting Policies The preparation of financial statements in conformity with U.S. generally accepted accounting principles ( GAAP ) requires management to use judgment in the application of accounting policies, including making estimates and assumptions. If our judgment or interpretation of the facts and circumstances relating to various transactions had been different, or different estimates or assumptions had been made, it is possible that different accounting policies would have been applied, resulting in different financial results or a different presentation of our financial statements. Below is a discussion of a number of accounting policies that we consider critical to an understanding of our financial condition and operating results that may require complex judgment in their application or require estimates about matters which are inherently uncertain. A discussion of our significant accounting policies, including further discussion of the accounting policies described below, can be found in Note 1, Organization and Significant Accounting Policies of our Consolidated Financial Statements. Cost Capitalization We capitalize costs during the development of assets (including interest and related loan fees, property taxes and other direct and indirect costs) beginning when development efforts commence until the asset, or a portion of the asset, is delivered and is ready for its intended use, which is generally indicated by the issuance of a certificate of occupancy. We capitalize costs during redevelopment of apartment homes (including interest and related loan fees, property taxes and other direct and indirect costs) beginning when an apartment home is taken out-of-service for redevelopment until the apartment home redevelopment is completed and the apartment home is available for a new resident. Rental income and operating expenses incurred during the initial lease-up or post-redevelopment lease-up period are fully recognized as they accrue. 51 We capitalize pre-development costs incurred in pursuit of Development Rights for which we currently believe future development is probable. These costs include legal fees, design fees and related overhead costs. Future development of these Development Rights is dependent upon various factors, including zoning and regulatory approval, rental market conditions, construction costs and availability of capital. Pre-development costs incurred in the pursuit of Development Rights for which future development is not yet considered probable are expensed as incurred. In addition, if the status of a Development Right changes, making future development no longer probable, any capitalized pre-development costs are written-off with a charge to expense. We generally capitalize only non-recurring expenditures. We capitalize improvements and upgrades only if the item: (i) exceeds $15,000; (ii) extends the useful life of the asset; and (iii) is not related to making an apartment home ready for the next resident. Under this policy, a significant portion of our capitalized costs are non-recurring, as recurring make-ready costs are expensed as incurred. Recurring make-ready costs include: (i) carpet and appliance replacements; (ii) floor coverings; (iii) interior painting; and (iv) other redecorating costs. Because we expense recurring make-ready costs, such as carpet replacements, our expense levels and volatility are greatest in the third quarter of each year as this is when we experience our greatest amount of turnover. We capitalize purchases of personal property, such as computers and furniture, only if the item is a new addition and the item exceeds $2,500. We generally expense replacements of personal property. In 2006, 2005 and 2004, the amounts capitalized (excluding land costs) related to acquisitions, development and redevelopment were $677,587,000, $425,170,000 and $347,091,000, respectively. For Established and Other Stabilized Communities, we recorded non-revenue generating capital expenditures of $18,000,000 or $497 per apartment home in 2006, $16,753,000 or $471 per apartment home in 2005 and $12,347,000 or $354 per apartment home in 2004. In addition, revenue generating, or expense saving capital expenditures, such as water sub metering equipment and cable installations, were $153,000, $817,000 and $637,000 in 2006, 2005 and 2004, respectively. The average maintenance costs charged to expense per apartment home, including carpet and appliance replacements, related to these communities was $1,638 in 2006, $1,546 in 2005 and $1,348 in 2004. Historically, we have experienced a gradual increase in capitalized costs and expensed maintenance costs per apartment home as the average age of our communities has increased. We expect to return to the trend of gradual increases in maintenance costs in future years. Asset Impairment Evaluation We assess the impairment of our investments and long-lived assets whenever events or changes in circumstances indicate that the carrying value may not be recoverable. For both our consolidated and unconsolidated entities, factors that could trigger an assessment for impairment include, but are not limited to: i) underperformance of the asset relative to historical or expected future operating results, ii) significant change in legal and economic factors, iii) incurrence of costs significantly in excess of amounts originally forecasted for construction or acquisition of an asset, or iv) an expectation that a long-lived asset will be disposed of at an amount below the current carrying value. We evaluate the key factors necessary in the assessment of asset impairment on a quarterly basis. In 2006, 2005 and 2004, we did not recognize any impairment in value associated with our investments or long-lived assets. We cannot predict the occurrence of future events that may cause an impairment assessment to be performed. REIT Status We are a Maryland corporation that has elected to be treated, for federal income tax purposes, as a REIT. We elected to be taxed as a REIT under the Internal Revenue Code of 1986 ( the Code ), as amended, for the year ended December 31, 1994 and have not revoked such election. A corporate REIT is a legal entity which holds real estate interests and must meet a number of organizational and operational requirements, including a requirement that it currently distribute at least 90% of its adjusted taxable income to stockholders. As a REIT, we generally will not be subject to corporate level federal income tax on taxable income if we distribute 100% of taxable income over time periods allowed under the Code to our stockholders. If we fail to qualify as a REIT in any taxable year, we will be subject to federal income taxes at regular corporate rates (subject to any applicable alternative minimum tax) and may not be able to elect to qualify as a REIT for four subsequent taxable years. 52 Results of Operations Our year-over-year operating performance is primarily affected by changes in net operating income of our current operating apartment communities due to market conditions; net operating income derived from acquisitions and development completions; the loss of net operating income related to disposed communities; and capital market, disposition and financing activity. A comparison of our operating results for the years 2006, 2005 and 2004 follows (dollars in thousands): 2006 2005 $ Change % Change 2005 2004 $ Change % Change Revenue: Rental and other income $ 731,041 $ 666,376 $ 64,665 9.7 % $ 666,376 $ 613,240 $ 53,136 8.7 % Management, development and other fees 6,259 4,304 1,955 45.4 % 4,304 604 3,700 612.6 % Total revenue 737,300 670,680 66,620 9.9 % 670,680 613,844 56,836 9.3 % Expenses: Direct property operating expenses, excluding property taxes 169,685 155,481 14,204 9.1 % 155,481 148,705 6,776 4.6 % Property taxes 68,257 65,487 2,770 4.2 % 65,487 59,458 6,029 10.1 % Total community operating expenses 237,942 220,968 16,974 7.7 % 220,968 208,163 12,805 6.2 % Corporate-level property management and other indirect operating expenses 34,177 31,243 2,934 9.4 % 31,243 27,956 3,287 11.8 % Investments and investment management 7,033 4,834 2,199 45.5 % 4,834 4,690 144 3.1 % Interest expense, net 111,046 127,099 (16,053 ) (12.6 %) 127,099 131,103 (4,004 ) (3.1 %) Depreciation expense 162,896 158,822 4,074 2.6 % 158,822 151,991 6,831 4.5 % General and administrative expense 24,767 25,761 (994 ) (3.9 %) 25,761 18,074 7,687 42.5 % Total other expenses 339,919 347,759 (7,840 ) (2.3 %) 347,759 333,814 13,945 4.2 % Equity in income of unconsolidated entities 7,455 7,198 257 3.6 % 7,198 1,100 6,098 n/a Venture partner interest in profit-sharing n/a (1,178 ) 1,178 (100.0 %) Minority interest in consolidated partnerships (573 ) (1,481 ) 908 (61.3 %) (1,481 ) (150 ) (1,331 ) n/a Gain on sale of land 13,519 4,479 9,040 201.8 % 4,479 1,138 3,341 293.6 % Income from continuing operations before cumulative effect of change in accounting principle 179,840 112,149 67,691 60.4 % 112,149 72,777 39,372 54.1 % Discontinued operations: Income from discontinued operations 1,148 14,942 (13,794 ) (92.3 %) 14,942 21,134 (6,192 ) (29.3 %) Gain on sale of communities 97,411 195,287 (97,876 ) (50.1 %) 195,287 121,287 74,000 61.0 % Total discontinued operations 98,559 210,229 (111,670 ) (53.1 %) 210,229 142,421 67,808 47.6 % Income before cumulative effect of change in accounting principle 278,399 322,378 (43,979 ) (13.6 %) 322,378 215,198 107,180 49.8 % Cumulative effect of change in accounting principle n/a 4,547 (4,547 ) n/a Net income 278,399 322,378 (43,979 ) (13.6 %) 322,378 219,745 102,633 46.7 % Dividends attributable to preferred stock (8,700 ) (8,700 ) (8,700 ) (8,700 ) Net income available to common stockholders $ 269,699 $ 313,678 $ (43,979 ) (14.0 %) $ 313,678 $ 211,045 $ 102,633 48.6 % Net income available to common stockholders decreased $43,979,000 or 14.0%, to $269,699,000 in 2006. This decrease is primarily attributable to reduced asset sales and related gains in 2006, partially offset by growth in net operating income from Established Communities and contributions to net operating income from newly developed communities. Net income available to common stockholders increased $102,633,000, or 48.6%, to $313,678,000 in 2005. This increase is primarily attributable to higher gains on sales of assets in 2005, including the gain related to the sale of a technology investment, as well as increased net operating income from Established Communities and newly developed communities. Net operating income ( NOI ) is considered by management to be an important and appropriate supplemental performance measure to net income because it helps both investors and management to understand the core operations of a community or communities prior to the allocation of any corporate-level or financing-related costs. NOI reflects the operating performance of a community and allows for an easy comparison of the operating performance of individual assets or groups of assets. In addition, because prospective buyers of real estate have different financing and overhead structures, with varying marginal impacts to overhead by acquiring real estate, NOI is considered by many in the real estate industry to be a useful measure for determining the value of a real estate asset or group of assets. We define NOI as total property revenue less direct property operating expenses, including property taxes. 53 NOI does not represent cash generated from operating activities in accordance with GAAP. Therefore, NOI should not be considered an alternative to net income as an indication of our performance. NOI should also not be considered an alternative to net cash flow from operating activities, as determined by GAAP, as a measure of liquidity, nor is NOI necessarily indicative of cash available to fund cash needs. A calculation of NOI for the years ended December 31, 2006, 2005 and 2004, along with a reconciliation to net income for each year, is as follows (dollars in thousands): For the year ended 12-31-06 12-31-05 12-31-04 Net income $ 278,399 $ 322,378 $ 219,745 Indirect operating expenses, net of corporate income 28,809 26,675 26,612 Investments and investment management 7,033 4,834 4,690 Interest expense, net 111,046 127,099 131,103 General and administrative expense 24,767 25,761 18,074 Equity in income of unconsolidated entities (7,455 ) (7,198 ) (1,100 ) Minority interest in consolidated partnerships 1,178 Venture partner interest in profit-sharing 573 1,481 150 Depreciation expense 162,896 158,822 151,991 Cumulative effect of change in accounting principle (4,547 ) Gain on sale of real estate assets (110,930 ) (199,766 ) (122,425 ) Income from discontinued operations (1,148 ) (14,942 ) (21,134 ) Net operating income $ 493,990 $ 445,144 $ 404,337 The NOI increases in both 2006 and 2005 as compared to the prior years, consist of changes in the following categories (dollars in thousands): 2006 2005 Increase Increase Established Communities $ 32,216 $ 13,052 Other Stabilized Communities 5,497 3,786 Development and Redevelopment Communities 11,133 23,969 Total $ 48,846 $ 40,807 The NOI increase in Established Communities in 2006 was largely due to the improved apartment market fundamentals. During 2006, we focused on rental rate growth, while maintaining occupancy of at least 95% in all regions. We will continue to seek increases in rental rates. However we anticipate that increases in rental rates and overall rental revenue growth may moderate in 2007, as we expect continued but moderating job growth (demand) and increased net supply as compared to recent periods. We expect revenue growth from our Established Communities of 5.0% to 6.5% in 2007 as compared to 2006. In addition, although we will continue to aggressively manage operating expenses, there is upward pressure on operating expenses from increasing utility, labor, insurance and property tax expenses. We expect operating expenses at our Established Communities to increase by 3.5% to 5.0% in 2007 as compared to 2006. Overall, we anticipate growth in NOI from our Established Communities of 5.5% to 7.5% in 2007 as compared to 2006. The Company has given projected NOI growth in 2007 only for Established Communities and not on a company-wide basis. The Company believes that NOI growth of the Established Communities assists investors in understanding management estimate of the likely contribution to operations from Established Communities. 54 However, the Company has not provided a projection of NOI growth on a company-wide basis due to the difficulty in projecting the timing of new development starts, dispositions and acquisitions, as well as the complexities involved in projecting the allocation of corporate-level property management overhead, general and administrative costs and interest expense to communities not yet developed, disposed or acquired. NOI growth expected from Established Communities is not a projection of the Company projected consolidated financial performance or projected cash flow. Rental and other income increased in 2006 due to increased rental rates and occupancy for our Established Communities, coupled with additional rental income generated from newly developed communities. We expect the strong apartment fundamentals experienced in 2006 to continue in 2007, but at a more moderate pace. Overall Portfolio The weighted average number of occupied apartment homes increased to 37,716 apartment homes for 2006 as compared to 36,520 apartment homes for 2005 and 34,540 apartment homes for 2004. This change is primarily the result of an increase in the overall occupancy rate and increased homes available from newly developed and acquired communities, partially offset by communities sold in 2006 and 2005. The weighted average monthly revenue per occupied apartment home increased to $1,610 in 2006 as compared to $1,516 in 2005 and $1,477 in 2004. Established Communities - Rental revenue increased $35,871,000, or 6.8%, in 2006 and increased $16,523,000, or 3.6%, in 2005. The increases in 2006 and 2005 are due to both increased rental rates and increased economic occupancy as compared to the prior years. For 2006, the weighted average monthly revenue per occupied apartment home increased 6.3% to $1,647 compared to $1,549 in 2005, primarily due to increased market rents and decreased concessions. The average economic occupancy increased from 96.0% in 2005 to 96.5% in 2006. Economic occupancy takes into account the fact that apartment homes of different sizes and locations within a community have different economic impacts on a community gross revenue. Economic occupancy is defined as gross potential revenue less vacancy loss, as a percentage of gross potential revenue. Gross potential revenue is determined by valuing occupied homes at leased rates and vacant homes at market rents. We expect rental revenue from Established Communities to increase 5.0% to 6.5% in 2007 as compared to 2006. We experienced increases in Established Communities rental revenue in all six of our regions in 2006 as compared to 2005. The largest increases in rental revenue were in the Pacific Northwest, the Mid-Atlantic and Northern California, with increases of 10.1%, 8.9% and 8.4%, respectively, between years. The Northeast and Northern California regions comprise the majority of our Established Community revenue, and therefore are discussed in more detail below. Northern California, which represented approximately 27.4% of Established Community rental revenue during 2006, experienced an increase in rental revenue of 8.4% in 2006 as compared to 2005. Average rental rates increased by 7.9% to $1,561 in 2006, and economic occupancy increased 0.5% to 96.7% in 2006. Apartment fundamentals improved in Northern California in 2006, resulting in accelerated revenue growth in this region. We expect Northern California to see continued revenue growth in 2007. The Northeast region, which accounted for approximately 36.5% of Established Community rental revenue during 2006, experienced an increase in rental revenue of 4.5% in 2006 as compared to 2005. Average rental rates increased 4.4% to $2,032 in 2006 and economic occupancy increased 0.1% to 96.5% during 2006. We expect job growth in 2007 to increase slightly over the growth levels experienced in 2006 in the Northeast and net supply to increase. However, we expect overall apartment fundamentals will remain favorable, resulting in moderate rental rate growth in the Northeast during 2007. The Company believes that Northern New Jersey will lead the region in revenue growth as a result of the strong apartment fundamentals in neighboring New York City. We expect Boston, Massachusetts will lag the region in revenue growth, as economic recovery is not occurring as quickly as in other areas of the region. In accordance with GAAP, cash concessions are amortized as an offset to rental revenue over the approximate lease term, which is generally one year. As a supplemental measure, we also present rental revenue with concessions stated on a cash basis to help investors evaluate the impact of both current and historical concessions on GAAP based rental revenue and to more readily enable comparisons to revenue as reported by other companies. 55 Rental revenue with concessions stated on a cash basis also allows investors to understand historical trends in cash concessions, as well as current rental market conditions. The following table reconciles total rental revenue in conformity with GAAP to total rental revenue adjusted to state concessions on a cash basis for our Established Communities for the years ended December 31, 2006 and 2005 (dollars in thousands). Information for the year ended December 31, 2004 is not presented, as Established Community classification is not comparable prior to January 1, 2005. See Note 9, Segment Reporting, of our Consolidated Financial Statements. For the year ended 12-31-06 12-31-05 Rental revenue (GAAP basis) $ 559,771 $ 523,900 Concessions amortized 11,082 20,010 Concessions granted (5,796 ) (17,399 ) Rental revenue adjusted to state concessions on a cash basis $ 565,057 $ 526,511 Year-over-year % change GAAP revenue 6.8 % n/a Year-over-year % change cash concession based revenue 7.3 % n/a Management, development and other fees increased in 2006 and 2005 due to increased asset management, property management and redevelopment fees earned from the Fund. The Fund was formed in March 2005, and continues to grow through purchases, acquiring five more communities in 2006. In addition, construction and development fees earned from unconsolidated entities in 2006 and 2005 contributed to increased fee income. Direct property operating expenses, excluding property taxes increased in both 2006 and 2005, primarily due to the addition of recently developed and acquired apartment homes coupled with expense growth in our Established Communities. For Established Communities, direct property operating expenses, excluding property taxes, increased $3,088,000, or 2.6%, to $120,487,000 in 2006 due primarily to increases in payroll, maintenance and utility costs, partially offset by decreases in marketing and office and administration expenses. During 2005, direct property operating expenses increased $965,000, or 0.9%, to $104,346,000 in 2005 due primarily to increases in utility, maintenance and payroll costs, partially offset by decreases in marketing and bad debt expenses. We expect operating expenses for Established Communities to increase by 3.5% to 5.0% in 2007 as compared to 2006, primarily as a result of continued higher utility and payroll costs, as well as increased insurance costs. Property taxes increased in both 2006 and 2005 due to overall higher assessments and the addition of newly developed and redeveloped apartment homes, and are impacted by the size and timing of successful tax appeals in both years. For Established Communities, property taxes increased by $721,000, or 1.4%, in 2006 and $2,527,000, or 5.7%, in 2005, due to overall higher assessments throughout all regions and are impacted by the size and timing of successful tax appeals in both years. We expect property taxes to continue to increase in 2007 as compared to 2006 to reflect increased valuations. However, property tax increases are mitigated for communities in California, where increases in property taxes are limited by law (Proposition 13). We evaluate property tax increases internally, as well as engage third-party consultants, and appeal increases when appropriate. Corporate-level property management and other indirect operating expenses increased in both 2006 and 2005 due to increased compensation, as well as increased costs relating to corporate initiatives focused on increasing efficiency and enhancing controls at our operating communities. 56 Investments and investment management reflects the costs incurred related to investment acquisitions, investment management and abandoned pursuit costs, which include costs incurred on development pursuits not yet considered probable for development, as well as the abandonment or impairment of development pursuits, acquisition pursuits and disposition pursuits. Investments and investment management increased in 2006 as compared to 2005 due primarily to increased compensation costs and increased staffing related to management of the Fund redevelopment activity, coupled with an increase in abandoned pursuit costs. Abandoned pursuit costs were $2,115,000 in 2006, $816,000 in 2005 and $1,726,000 in 2004. Abandoned pursuit costs can be volatile, and the costs incurred in any given period may vary significantly in future years. Interest expense, net decreased in 2006 as compared to 2005 due primarily to higher levels of capitalized interest in connection with our increased development activity, lower average outstanding balances on our unsecured credit facility and increased interest income. In addition, through a maturity and the subsequent issuance of unsecured notes, we reduced the effective annual interest rate on $150,000,000 of debt by approximately 1%. These decreases in interest expense are partially offset by higher interest rates on variable rate debt in 2006 and the timing of the repayment and re-issuance of unsecured debt in 2005. Interest income increased in 2006 due to higher invested cash balances as well as increases in the interest rate earned on cash deposits. In addition, interest income in 2006 includes interest earned on an escrow funded from a disposition in 2005 that was used in a tax-deferred exchange. Depreciation expense increased in both 2006 and 2005 primarily due to the completion of development and redevelopment activities, coupled with the timing of depreciation expense for a community previously classified as held for sale. General and administrative expense ( G&A ) decreased in 2006 and increased in 2005 relative to the prior years primarily due to the incurrence in 2005 of the following: (i) separation costs of approximately $2,100,000 due to the departure of a senior executive; (ii) the accrual of costs related to various litigation matters of approximately $1,500,000; and (iii) increased board of director fees due to the acceleration of equity awards with the resignation of a director due to disability in 2005, partially offset by higher compensation costs in 2006. We expect expensed overhead costs, including G&A, corporate-level property management and investments and investment management, to increase approximately 6.0% to 7.5% in 2007 as compared to 2006 in support of the Company continued growth. Equity in income of unconsolidated entities in 2006 includes our share of gain on the sale of a joint venture community in the amount of $6,609,000, and the release of amounts previously withheld in escrow allowing recognition of the final installment of the gain from the sale of our investment in Rent.com to eBay in the amount of $433,000. Equity in income of unconsolidated entities in 2005 includes the initial gain recognized in the amount of $6,252,000 related to the sale of our investment in Rent.com to eBay. Minority interest in consolidated partnerships decreased in 2006 as compared to 2005 due to the conversion of limited partnership units, thereby reducing outside ownership interests and the allocation of net income to outside ownership interests. However, minority interest increased in 2005 due to the consolidation of an entity under FASB Interpretation No. 46 ( FIN 46 ), Consolidation of Variable Interest Entities, an Interpretation of ARB No. 51, as revised in December 2003. Effective January 1, 2004, we consolidated an entity from which we held a participating mortgage note in accordance with FIN 46. We did not hold an equity interest in this entity, and therefore 100% of the entity net loss was recognized as minority interest in consolidated partnerships during the year ended December 31, 2004. In October 2004, we received payment in full of the outstanding mortgage note due from this entity. Upon repayment of the mortgage note, our economic interest in this entity ended, and therefore we discontinued consolidation as this entity was no longer considered a variable interest entity under FIN 46. Gain on sale of land in 2006 represents the gain on sale of three land parcels located in Danvers, Massachusetts, Jersey City, New Jersey and Stamford, Connecticut. During 2005, we sold three land parcels, one located in Dublin, California, one in Madison, Washington, and one in Freehold, New Jersey. 57 Income from discontinued operations represents the net income generated by communities sold during the period from January 1, 2004 through December 31, 2006. See Note 7, Real Estate Disposition Activities, of our Consolidated Financial Statements. The decreases in 2006 and 2005 are due to the sale of three consolidated communities in 2006, seven communities and one office building in 2005 and five communities in 2004, eliminating the income generated from the assets upon disposition. Gain on sale of real estate assets decreased in 2006 as compared to 2005 primarily due to the volume and size of dispositions, coupled with the carrying value of the communities sold. Gain on sale of real estate assets increased in 2005 and decreased in 2004 due to the volume and size of dispositions in each year. The amount of gain realized in any given reporting period depends on many factors, including the number of communities sold, the size and carrying value of those communities and the sales price, which are driven by local and national market conditions. Cumulative effect of change in accounting principle in 2004 is a result of the implementation of FIN 46, discussed above, and represents the difference between the net assets consolidated under FIN 46 and the previously recorded net assets. Funds from Operations Attributable to Common Stockholders ( FFO ) FFO is considered by management to be an appropriate supplemental measure of our operating and financial performance. In calculating FFO, we exclude gains or losses related to dispositions of previously depreciated property and exclude real estate depreciation. These amounts are generally excluded in the industry definition of FFO as amounts can vary among owners of identical assets in similar condition based on historical cost accounting and useful life estimates. FFO can help one compare the operating performance of a real estate company between periods or as compared to different companies. We believe that in order to understand our operating results, FFO should be examined with net income as presented in our Consolidated Financial Statements. For a more detailed discussion and presentation of FFO, see Selected Financial Data, included in Item 6 of this report. Liquidity and Capital Resources Factors affecting our liquidity and capital resources are our cash flows from operations, financing activities and investing activities, as well as general economic and market conditions. Operating cash flow has historically been determined by: (i) the number of apartment homes currently owned, (ii) rental rates, (iii) occupancy levels and (iv) operating expenses with respect to apartment homes. The timing, source and amount of cash flows provided by financing activities and used in investing activities are sensitive to the capital markets environment, particularly to changes in interest rates. The timing and type of capital markets activity in which we engage, as well as our plans for development, redevelopment, acquisition and disposition activity, are affected by changes in the capital markets environment, such as changes in interest rates or the availability of cost-effective capital. We regularly review our liquidity needs, the adequacy of cash flows from operations, and other expected liquidity sources to meet these needs. We believe our principal short-term liquidity needs are to fund: normal recurring operating expenses; debt service and maturity payments; preferred stock dividends and DownREIT partnership unit distributions; the minimum dividend payments on our common stock required to maintain our REIT qualification under the Internal Revenue Code of 1986; development and redevelopment activity in which we are currently engaged; and capital calls for the Fund, as required. We anticipate that we can fully satisfy these needs from a combination of cash flow provided by operating activities, proceeds from asset dispositions and borrowing capacity under our variable rate unsecured credit facility, as well as other public or private sources of liquidity. 58 Cash and cash equivalents totaled $8,567,000 at December 31, 2006, an increase of $2,852,000 from $5,715,000 at December 31, 2005. The following discussion relates to changes in cash due to operating, investing and financing activities, which are presented in our Consolidated Statements of Cash Flows included elsewhere in this report. Operating Activities Net cash provided by operating activities increased to $351,943,000 in 2006 from $306,248,000 in 2005. The increase was driven primarily by the additional NOI from our Established Communities operations, as well as NOI from recently developed communities, partially offset by the loss of NOI from the four communities sold in 2006, as discussed earlier in this report. Investing Activities Net cash used in investing activities of $511,371,000 in 2006 related to investments in assets through the development redevelopment and acquisition of apartment communities, partially offset by proceeds from asset dispositions. During 2006, we invested $832,337,000 in the purchase and development of the following real estate and capital expenditures: We began the development of eight new communities. These eight communities, if developed as expected, will contain a total of 2,459 apartment homes, and the total capitalized cost, including land acquisition costs, is projected to be approximately $686,600,000. We completed the development of six communities containing a total of 1,368 apartment homes for a total capitalized cost, including land acquisition cost, of $375,200,000. We began the redevelopment of three consolidated communities, which contain an aggregate of 1,593 apartment homes and, if redeveloped as expected, will be completed for a total redevelopment capitalized cost of $25,800,000, excluding costs incurred prior to redevelopment. We completed the redevelopment of one consolidated community containing 336 apartment homes for a total capitalized cost of $6,000,000, excluding costs incurred prior to redevelopment. We acquired nine parcels of land in connection with Development Rights, for an aggregate purchase price of $91,574,000 . We had capital expenditures relating to current communities real estate assets of $21,289,000 and non-real estate capital expenditures of $957,000. We disposed of four communities (one through a joint venture) for an aggregate sales price of $261,850,000 and a total gain in accordance with GAAP of $104,020,000. We also disposed of three parcels of land for an aggregate sales price of $19,635,000 and a total gain in accordance with GAAP of $13,519,000. In addition, we received proceeds in the amount of $20,482,000 from the sale of a 70% interest in our investments in Avalon Del Rey Apartments, LLC. For further discussion See Note 6, Investments in Unconsolidated Entities, included in Item 8 of this report. Financing Activities Net cash provided by financing activities totaled $162,280,000 in 2006. The net cash inflow is due primarily to the proceeds from $500,000,000 of unsecured notes that we issued in September 2006, partially offset by the $150,000,000 of unsecured notes that was repaid upon maturity in July 2006. In addition, net cash provided by financing activities includes the issuance of common stock for option exercises and the issuance of secured mortgage loans, partially offset by dividends paid and repayment of borrowings under our unsecured credit facility. See Note 3, Notes Payable, Unsecured Notes and Credit Facility, and Note 4, Stockholders Equity, of our Consolidated Financial Statements, for additional information. Variable Rate Unsecured Credit Facility We entered into a $650,000,000 revolving variable rate unsecured credit facility with a syndicate of commercial banks. JPMorgan Chase Bank, Wachovia Bank, N.A. and Bank of America, N.A. led the syndication effort in varying capacities. Under the terms of the credit facility, we may elect to increase the facility up to $1,000,000,000, provided that one or more banks (from the syndicate or otherwise) voluntarily agree to provide the additional commitment. No member of the syndicate of banks can prohibit such an increase; such an increase in the facility will only be effective to the extent banks (from the syndicate or otherwise) choose to commit to lend additional funds. We pay participating banks, in the aggregate, an annual facility fee of approximately $813,000. The unsecured credit facility bears interest at varying levels based on the London Interbank Offered Rate ( LIBOR ), our credit rating and on a maturity schedule selected by us. The current stated pricing is LIBOR plus 0.40% per annum (5.72% on January 31, 2007). 59 The spread over LIBOR can vary from LIBOR plus 0.325% to LIBOR plus 1.00% based on our credit rating. In addition, a competitive bid option is available for borrowings of up to $422,500,000. This option allows banks that are part of the lender consortium to bid to provide us loans at a rate that is lower than the stated pricing provided by the unsecured credit facility. The competitive bid option may result in lower pricing if market conditions allow. We had no outstanding balance under this competitive bid option at January 31, 2007. We are subject to certain customary covenants under the unsecured credit facility, including, but not limited to, maintaining certain maximum leverage ratios, a minimum fixed charges coverage ratio and minimum unencumbered assets and equity levels. The credit facility matures in November 2011, assuming our exercise of a one-year renewal option. At January 31, 2007, no amounts were outstanding on the credit facility, $38,088,000 was used to provide letters of credit and $611,912,000 was available for borrowing under the unsecured credit facility. Future Financing and Capital Needs Debt Maturities One of our principal long-term liquidity needs is the repayment of long-term debt at the time that such debt matures. For unsecured notes, we anticipate that no significant portion of the principal of these notes will be repaid prior to maturity. If we do not have funds on hand sufficient to repay our indebtedness as it becomes due, it will be necessary for us to refinance the debt. This refinancing may be accomplished by uncollateralized private or public debt offerings, additional debt financing that is collateralized by mortgages on individual communities or groups of communities, draws on our unsecured credit facility or by additional equity offerings. Although we believe we will have the capacity to meet our long-term liquidity needs, we cannot assure you that additional debt financing or debt or equity offerings will be available or, if available, that they will be on terms we consider satisfactory. The following debt activity occurred during the year ended December 31, 2006: We repaid $150,000,000 in previously issued unsecured notes in July 2006, along with any unpaid interest, pursuant to their scheduled maturity. No prepayment penalty was incurred; We issued a total of $500,000,000 of unsecured notes in September 2006 under our existing shelf registration statement. The offering consisted of two separate tranches of $250,000,000 with an annual effective interest rate of 5.586% and 5.820%, maturing in 2012 and 2016, respectively; We issued $34,000,000 of variable rate mortgage debt for one community in April 2006, maturing in April 2011; We issued $93,800,000 of variable rate, tax-exempt debt for one community in December 2006, maturing in November 2037; We issued $48,500,000 of variable rate, tax-exempt debt for one community in December 2006, maturing in November 2039; and We issued $45,000,000 of variable rate, tax-exempt debt for one community in December 2006, maturing in July 2040. In January 2007, the Company filed a shelf registration statement with the Securities and Exchange Commission, allowing us to sell an undetermined number or amount of certain debt and equity securities as defined in the prospectus. In addition, in January 2007, in conjunction with the inclusion of our common stock in the S&P 500 Index, we issued 4,600,000 shares of our common stock at $129.30 per share. Net proceeds of approximately $594,000,000 will be used for general corporate purposes. 60 The table below details debt maturities for the next five years, excluding our unsecured credit facility, for debt outstanding at December 31, 2006 (dollars in thousands).

(2) Financed by variable rate, tax-exempt debt, but the interest rate on a portion of this debt is effectively fixed at December 31, 2006 and December 31, 2005 through a swap agreement. The portion of the debt fixed through a swap agreement decreases (and therefore the variable portion of the debt increases) monthly as payments are made to a principal reserve fund. (3) Variable rates are given as of December 31, 2006. (4) Financed by variable rate debt, but interest rate is capped through an interest rate protection agreement. (5) Represents full amount of the debt as of December 31, 2006. Actual amounts drawn on the debt as of December 31, 2006 are $79,849 for Bowery Place I and $0 for both Bowery Place II and Avalon Acton. (6) Balances outstanding represent total amounts due at maturity, and are not net of $2,922 and $818 of debt discount as of December 31, 2006 and December 31, 2005, respectively, as reflected in unsecured notes on our Consolidated Balance Sheets included elsewhere in this report. 61 Future Financing and Capital Needs Portfolio and Other Activity As of December 31, 2006, we had 17 new communities under construction, for which a total estimated cost of $639,458,000 remained to be invested. In addition, we had six communities which we own, or in which we have a direct or indirect interest, under reconstruction, for which a total estimated cost of $13,791,000 remained to be invested. Substantially all of the capital expenditures necessary to complete the communities currently under construction and reconstruction, as well as development costs related to pursuing Development Rights, will be funded from: cash currently on hand invested in highly liquid overnight money market funds and repurchase agreements; the remaining capacity under our current $650,000,000 unsecured credit facility; the net proceeds from sales of existing communities; retained operating cash; the issuance of debt or equity securities (including proceeds from the recent stock offering); and/or private equity funding. Before planned reconstruction activity, including reconstruction activity related to communities acquired by the Fund as discussed below, or the construction of a Development Right begins, we intend to arrange adequate financing to complete these undertakings, although we cannot assure you that we will be able to obtain such financing. In the event that financing cannot be obtained, we may have to abandon Development Rights, write-off associated pre-development costs that were capitalized and/or forego reconstruction activity. In such instances, we will not realize the increased revenues and earnings that we expected from such Development Rights or reconstruction activity and significant losses could be incurred. We have invested in the Fund, a private, discretionary investment vehicle that acquires and operates apartment communities in our markets. The Fund will serve, until March 16, 2008 or until 80% of its committed capital is invested, as the principal vehicle through which we will invest in the acquisition of apartment communities, subject to certain exceptions. These exceptions include significant individual asset and portfolio acquisitions, properties acquired in tax-deferred transactions and acquisitions that are inadvisable or inappropriate for the Fund. The Fund will not restrict our development activities, and will terminate after a term of eight years, subject to two one-year extensions. The Fund has nine institutional investors, including us, with a combined equity capital commitment of $330,000,000. A significant portion of the investments made in the Fund by its investors are being made through AvalonBay Value Added Fund, Inc., a Maryland corporation that qualifies as a REIT under the Internal Revenue Code (the Fund REIT ). A wholly-owned subsidiary of the Company is the general partner of the Fund and has committed $50,000,000 to the Fund and the Fund REIT (of which approximately $22,944,000 has been invested as of January 31, 2007) representing a 15.2% combined general partner and limited partner equity interest. Under the Fund documents, the Fund has the ability to employ leverage through debt financings up to 65% on a portfolio basis, which, if achieved, would enable the Fund to invest up to $940,000,000 (of which approximately $514,000,000 has been invested as of January 31, 2007). We currently expect that leverage of less than 65% will be employed, reducing the projected investment value to between $850,000,000 and $900,000,000. From time to time we use joint ventures to hold or develop individual real estate assets. We generally employ joint ventures primarily to mitigate asset concentration or market risk or secondarily as a source of liquidity. We may also use joint ventures related to mixed-use land development opportunities where our partners bring development and operational expertise to the venture. Each joint venture or partnership agreement has been and will continue to be individually negotiated, and our ability to operate and/or dispose of a community in our sole discretion may be limited to varying degrees depending on the terms of the joint venture or partnership agreement. However, we cannot assure you that we will achieve our objectives through joint ventures. 62 In evaluating our allocation of capital within our markets, we sell assets that do not meet our long-term investment criteria or when capital and real estate markets allow us to realize a portion of the value created over the past business cycle and redeploy the proceeds from those sales to develop and redevelop communities. In response to real estate and capital markets conditions, we sold four communities, including an investment held in a joint venture, with net proceeds in the aggregate of approximately $218,492,000 from January 1, 2006 through January 31, 2007. Because the proceeds from the sale of communities may not be immediately redeployed into revenue generating assets, the immediate effect of a sale of a community for a gain is to increase net income, but reduce future total revenues, total expenses and NOI. However, we believe that the absence of future cash flows from communities sold will have a minimal impact on our ability to fund future liquidity and capital resource needs. Off Balance Sheet Arrangements In addition to the investment interests in consolidated and unconsolidated real estate entities, we have certain off balance sheet arrangements with the entities in which we invest. Additional discussion of these entities can be found in Note 6, Investments in Unconsolidated Entities, and Note 8, Commitments and Contingencies, of our Consolidated Financial Statements located elsewhere in this report. CVP I, LLC CVP I, LLC has outstanding tax-exempt, variable rate bonds maturing in November 2036 in the amount of $117,000,000, which have permanent credit enhancement. We have agreed to guarantee, under limited circumstances, the repayment to the credit enhancer of any advances it may make in fulfillment of CVP I, LLC repayment obligations under the bonds. We have also guaranteed to the credit enhancer that CVP I, LLC will obtain a final certificate of occupancy for the project (Chrystie Place in New York City) overall once tenant improvements related to a retail tenant are complete, which is expected in 2007. Our 80% partner in this venture has agreed that it will reimburse us its pro rata share of any amounts paid relative to these guaranteed obligations. The estimated fair value of, and our obligation under these guarantees, both at inception and as of December 31, 2006 were not significant. As a result we have not recorded any obligation associated with these guarantees at December 31, 2006. MVP I, LLC MVP I, LLC has a construction loan in the amount of $94,400,000 (of which $76,739,000 is outstanding as of December 31, 2006), which matures in September 2010, assuming exercise of two one-year renewal options, and is payable by the unconsolidated real estate entity. In connection with the construction management services that we provided to MVP I, LLC, the entity that owns and developed Avalon at Mission Bay North II in San Francisco, we have provided a construction completion guarantee to the lender in order to fulfill their standard financing requirements related to the construction financing. Construction was completed in 2006, and our obligations under this guarantee will terminate once all of the lender standard completion requirements have been satisfied, which we currently expect to occur in 2007. The estimated fair value of and our obligation under this guarantee, both at inception and as of December 31, 2006 was not significant and therefore no liability has been recorded related to this construction completion guarantee as of December 31, 2006. The Fund The Fund has 12 mortgage loans with amounts outstanding in the aggregate of $259,645,000. These mortgage loans have varying maturity dates (or dates after which the loans can be prepaid), ranging from February 2007 to October 2014. These mortgage loans are secured by the underlying real estate. In addition, the Fund has a credit facility with $57,400,000 outstanding as of December 31, 2006, which matures in January 2008. The mortgage loans and the credit facility are payable by the Fund with operating cash flow from the underlying real estate, and the credit facility is secured by capital commitments. We have not guaranteed the debt of the Fund, nor do we have any obligation to fund this debt should the Fund be unable to do so. 63 In addition, as part of the formation of the Fund, we have provided to one of the limited partners a guarantee. The guarantee provides that if, upon final liquidation of the Fund, the total amount of all distributions to that partner during the life of the Fund (whether from operating cash flow or property sales) does not equal a minimum of the total capital contributions made by that partner, then we will pay the partner an amount equal to the shortfall, but in no event more than 10% of the total capital contributions made by the partner (maximum of approximately $3,400,000 as of December 31, 2006). As of December 31, 2006, the fair value of the real estate assets owned by the Fund is considered adequate to cover such potential payment to that partner under a liquidation scenario. The estimated fair value of, and our obligation under this guarantee, both at inception and as of December 31, 2006 was not significant and therefore we have not recorded any obligation for this guarantee as of December 31, 2006. PHVP I, LLC In connection with the pursuit of a Development Right in Pleasant Hill, California, $125,000,000 in bond financing was issued by the Contra Costa County Redevelopment Agency (the Agency ) in connection with the possible future construction of a multifamily rental community by PHVP I, LLC. The bond proceeds were immediately invested in their entirety in a guaranteed investment contract ( GIC ) administered by a trustee. This Development Right is planned as a mixed-use development, with residential, for-sale, retail and office components. The bond proceeds will remain in the GIC until at least June 1, 2007, but no later than December 5, 2007, at which time a loan will be made to PHVP I, LLC to fund construction of the multifamily portion of the development, or the bonds will be redeemed by the Agency. Although we do not have any equity or economic interest in PHVP I, LLC at this time, we do have an option to make a capital contribution to PHVP I, LLC in exchange for a 99% general partner interest in the entity. Should we decide not to exercise this option, the bonds will be redeemed, and a loan will not be made to PHVP I, LLC. The bonds are payable from the proceeds of the GIC and are non-recourse to both PHVP I, LLC and to us. There is no loan payable outstanding by PHVP I, LLC as of December 31, 2006. In addition, as part of providing construction management services to PHVP I, LLC for the construction of a public garage, we have provided a construction completion guarantee to the related lender in order to fulfill their standard financing requirements related to the garage construction financing. Our obligations under this guarantee will terminate following construction completion of the garage once all of the lender standard completion requirements have been satisfied, which we currently expect to occur in 2008. In the third quarter of 2006, significant modifications were requested by the local transit authority to change the garage structure design. We do not believe that the requested design changes impact the construction schedule. However, it is expected that these changes will increase the original budget by an amount up to $5,000,000. We believe that substantially all potential additional amounts are reimbursable from unrelated third parties. At this time we do not believe that it is probable that we will incur any additional costs. The estimated fair value of, and our obligation under this guarantee, both at inception and as of December 31, 2006 was not significant and therefore we have not recorded any obligation for this guarantee as of December 31, 2006. Avalon Del Rey Apartments, LLC In the fourth quarter of 2006, we admitted a 70% venture partner to the LLC for an investment of $49,000,000, including the assumption of debt. In conjunction with this investment, we provided an operating guarantee to the joint venture partner. This guarantee provides that if the initial year return earned by the joint venture partner is less than a threshold return of 7% on its initial equity investment, we will pay the joint venture partner an amount equal to the shortfall, up to the 7% threshold return required. As of December 31, 2006, the cash flows and expected return on investment of the community are expected to meet and exceed the initial year threshold return required by our joint venture partner. Therefore we have not recorded any liability associated with this guarantee as of December 31, 2006. There are no other lines of credit, side agreements, financial guarantees or any other derivative financial instruments related to or between us and our unconsolidated real estate entities. In evaluating our capital structure and overall leverage, management takes into consideration our proportionate share of this unconsolidated debt. 64 Contractual Obligations We currently have contractual obligations consisting primarily of long-term debt obligations and lease obligations for certain land parcels and regional and administrative office space. Scheduled contractual obligations required for the next five years and thereafter are as follows as of December 31, 2006 (dollars in thousands): Payments due by period Less than 1 More than 5 Total Year 1-3 Years 3-5 Years Years Long-Term Debt Obligations (1) $ 2,828,508 $ 268,521 $ 440,710 $ 626,556 $ 1,492,721 Operating Lease Obligations (2) 1,868,720 8,045 16,411 16,156 1,828,108 Total $ 4,697,228 $ 276,566 $ 457,121 $ 642,712 $ 3,320,829 (1) No balance outstanding under our variable rate unsecured credit facility as of December 31, 2006. Amounts exclude interest payable as of December 31, 2006. (2) Includes land leases expiring between July 2029 and March 2142. Amounts do not include any adjustment for purchase options available under the land leases. Inflation and Deflation Substantially all of our apartment leases are for a term of one year or less. In an inflationary environment, this may allow us to realize increased rents upon renewal of existing leases or the beginning of new leases. Short-term leases generally minimize our risk from the adverse effects of inflation, although these leases generally permit residents to leave at the end of the lease term and therefore expose us to the effect of a decline in market rents. In a deflationary rent environment, we may be exposed to declining rents more quickly under these shorter term leases. Forward-Looking Statements This Form 10-K contains forward-looking statements as that term is defined under the Private Securities Litigation Reform Act of 1995. You can identify forward-looking statements by our use of the words believe, expect, anticipate, intend, estimate, assume, project, plan, may, shall, will and other similar expressions in this Form 10-K, that predict or indicate future events and trends and that do not report historical matters. These statements include, among other things, statements regarding our intent, belief or expectations with respect to: our potential development, redevelopment, acquisition or disposition of communities; the timing and cost of completion of apartment communities under construction, reconstruction, development or redevelopment; the timing of lease-up, occupancy and stabilization of apartment communities; the pursuit of land on which we are considering future development; the anticipated operating performance of our communities; cost, yield and earnings estimates; our declaration or payment of distributions; our joint venture and discretionary fund activities; our policies regarding investments, indebtedness, acquisitions, dispositions, financings and other matters; our qualification as a REIT under the Internal Revenue Code; the real estate markets in Northern and Southern California and markets in selected states in the Mid-Atlantic, Northeast, Midwest and Pacific Northwest regions of the United States and in general; the availability of debt and equity financing; interest rates; general economic conditions; and trends affecting our financial condition or results of operations. 65 We cannot assure the future results or outcome of the matters described in these statements; rather, these statements merely reflect our current expectations of the approximate outcomes of the matters discussed. You should not rely on forward-looking statements because they involve known and unknown risks, uncertainties and other factors, some of which are beyond our control. These risks, uncertainties and other factors, which we describe in Item 1a, Risk Factors, elsewhere in this report, may cause our actual results, performance or achievements to differ materially from the anticipated future results, performance or achievements expressed or implied by these forward-looking statements. In addition, these forward-looking statements represent our estimates and assumptions only as of the date of this report. We do not undertake a duty to update these forward-looking statements, and therefore they may not represent our estimates and assumptions after the date of this report. Some of the factors that could cause our actual results, performance or achievements to differ materially from those expressed or implied by these forward-looking statements include, but are not limited to, the following: we may fail to secure development opportunities due to an inability to reach agreements with third parties to obtain land at attractive prices or to obtain desired zoning and other local approvals; we may abandon or defer development opportunities for a number of reasons, including changes in local market conditions which make development less desirable, increases in costs of development and increases in the cost of capital, resulting in losses; construction costs of a community may exceed our original estimates; we may not complete construction and lease-up of communities under development or redevelopment on schedule, resulting in increased interest costs and construction costs and a decrease in our expected rental revenues; occupancy rates and market rents may be adversely affected by competition and local economic and market conditions which are beyond our control; financing may not be available on favorable terms or at all, and our cash flows from operations and access to cost effective capital may be insufficient for the development of our pipeline which could limit our pursuit of opportunities; our cash flows may be insufficient to meet required payments of principal and interest, and we may be unable to refinance existing indebtedness or the terms of such refinancing may not be as favorable as the terms of existing indebtedness; we may be unsuccessful in our management of the Fund and the Fund REIT; and we may be unsuccessful in managing changes in our portfolio composition.
