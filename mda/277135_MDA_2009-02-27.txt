Item 7: Management Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations Overview General. Grainger distributes facilities maintenance products and provides services and related information used by businesses and institutions primarily in the United States, Canada and Mexico to keep their facilities and equipment running. Grainger reports its operating results in three segments: Grainger Branch-based, Acklands Grainger Branch-based (Acklands Grainger) and Lab Safety Supply, Inc. (Lab Safety). Grainger distributes a wide range of products used by businesses and institutions to keep their facilities and equipment up and running. Grainger uses a multichannel business model to provide customers with a range of options for finding and purchasing products through a network of branches, sales representatives, direct marketing including catalogs, and a variety of electronic and Internet channels. Grainger serves customers through 617 branches, 18 distribution centers and multiple Web sites. Business Environment. Several economic factors and industry trends shape Grainger business environment. The current overall economy and leading economic indicators provide insight into anticipated economic factors for the near term and help in forming the development of projections for the upcoming year. In February 2009, Consensus Forecast-USA projected a 2009 GDP decline of 2.1% and an Industrial Production decline of 7.2% for the United States, as compared to 2008 GDP growth of 1.3% and a 1.7% decline in Industrial Production. In February 2009, Consensus Forecast-USA projected a GDP decline of 1.1% for Canada, as compared to the 2008 growth estimate of 0.6%. Historically, Grainger sales trends have tended to correlate positively with industrial production growth and non-farm payrolls. In more recent years, Grainger sales growth in the United States has outperformed both economic indicators. For the first five months of 2008, Grainger benefited from the growth in industrial production and non-farm payrolls. Both economic indicators began to deteriorate in May 2008, however, Grainger continued to outperform both until late 2008, at which time Grainger sales began to be negatively affected by the economic downturn. The light and heavy manufacturing customer sectors, which comprised approximately 25% of Grainger total 2008 sales, have historically correlated with manufacturing employment levels and manufacturing production. Manufacturing employment levels in the United States declined approximately 5.7% from December 2007 to December 2008, while manufacturing output decreased 9.9% from December 2007 to December 2008. This decline in manufacturing employment and output contributed to low single-digit sales growth in the light manufacturing customer sector and flat sales growth in the heavy manufacturing customer sector for Grainger in 2008. Given the steep decline in the economic trends in Grainger markets in the fourth quarter of 2008, it is difficult to project future results. During the fourth quarter, Grainger began implementing contingency plans to deal with the changing environment, which included a hiring freeze on all non-customer-facing positions, a reduction in hours of part-time employees and a significant reduction to travel, consulting and relocation expenses. In response to a continuing decline in sales, on February 11, 2009, Grainger announced plans to freeze salaries of all executives and salaried employees and indicated that the payment of management incentive bonuses for 2009 would occur only if Grainger meets aggressive sales targets. Additionally, Grainger announced 300 to 400 jobs would be eliminated as a result of lower sales volume and the combination of its Lab Safety Supply and Grainger Industrial Supply businesses, resulting in annualized cost savings of between $25 million and $35 million. See Note 22 to the Consolidated Financial Statements. In 2004, Grainger launched a multiyear market expansion program in the United States to strengthen its presence in top metropolitan markets and better position itself to serve the local customer. The expansion program was completed in 2008, however, the benefits realized from this initiative are expected to continue. In 2006, Grainger launched a multiyear product line expansion program in the United States. Over the past three years, Grainger has added over 150,000 new products to supplement Industrial Supply plumbing, fastener, material handling and security product lines. The product line expansion program contributed to the sales growth in 2007 and 2008, and is expected to be a driver of growth in 2009 and beyond. In 2009, Grainger expects to add 50,000 new products to further supplement Industrial Supply product lines. Grainger financial strength enables it to fund major initiatives, acquisitions and productivity improvements. Capital spending in 2008 for the U.S. market expansion program was approximately $40 million, with total capital expenditures of $196 million. Capital expenditures are expected to range from $175 million to $200 million in 2009. Projected investments include improved infrastructure in distribution centers, both in the U.S. and Canada, information technology, including 11 upgraded electronic commerce platforms, and the normal recurring replacement of equipment. Grainger expects to fund 2009 capital investments from operating cash flows, with spending planned for the following major projects: $90 million to $105 million for supply chain infrastructure; $15 million to $35 million for information technology. Matters Affecting Comparability. There were 256 sales days in 2008, compared to 255 sales days in 2007 and 254 sales days in 2006. Since June 2008, Grainger operating results have included the operating results of Excel F.I.G. Inc. (Excel) in the Acklands Grainger segment, and since July 2008 Grainger operating results have included the operating results of Highsmith Inc. (Highsmith) in the Lab Safety segment. Since May 2007, Grainger operating results have included the operating results of McFeely Square Drive Screws (McFeely s) in the Lab Safety segment. See Note 3 to the Consolidated Financial Statements for additional information regarding business acquisitions. Results of Operations The following table is included as an aid to understanding changes in Grainger Consolidated Statements of Earnings: For the Years Ended December 31, As a Percent of Net Sales Percent Increase/(Decrease) from Prior Year 2008 2007 2006 2008 2007 Net sales 100.0 % 100.0 % 100.0 % 6.7 % 9.1 % Cost of merchandise sold 59.0 59.4 60.0 6.0 8.1 Gross profit 41.0 40.6 40.0 7.9 10.6 Operating expenses 29.6 30.1 30.2 4.8 8.8 Operating earnings 11.4 10.5 9.8 16.7 16.0 Other income (expense) (0.1 ) 0.2 0.4 (184.3 ) (55.1 ) Income taxes 4.4 4.1 3.7 13.8 19.2 Net earnings 6.9 % 6.6 % 6.5 % 13.1 % 9.6 % 2008 Compared to 2007 Grainger net sales of $6,850.0 million for 2008 increased 6.7% when compared with net sales of $6,418.0 million for 2007. There was one more selling day in 2008 versus 2007. Daily sales were up 6.3%. The increase in net sales was led by high single-digit sales growth in the government sector, and mid single-digit sales growth in the commercial and reseller sectors. Approximately 1 percentage point of the sales growth came from Grainger product line expansion initiative and approximately 5 percentage points came from price and volume. Refer to the Segment Analysis below for further detail of Grainger ongoing strategic initiatives. The gross profit margin for 2008 improved 0.4 percentage point to 41.0% from 40.6% in 2007. The improvement in the gross profit margin was primarily driven by positive inflation recovery, partially offset by unfavorable selling price category mix. Operating earnings of $782.7 million for 2008 increased 16.7% over the $670.7 million for 2007. This earnings improvement exceeded the sales growth rate due to an improved gross profit margin and positive operating expense leverage. Net earnings for 2008 increased by 13.1% to $475.4 million from $420.1 million in 2007. The growth in net earnings for 2008 primarily resulted from the improvement in operating earnings, partially offset by lower interest income, higher interest expense and the write-off of Grainger $6.0 million investment in Asia Pacific Brands India Ltd. (Asia Pacific Brands). Diluted earnings per share of $6.04 in 2008 were 22.3% higher than the $4.94 for 2007. This improvement was higher than the percentage increase for net earnings due to the effect of Grainger share repurchase program. Segment Analysis The following comments at the segment level include external and intersegment net sales and operating earnings. Comments at the business unit level include external and inter- and intrasegment net sales and operating earnings. See Note 18 to the Consolidated Financial Statements. Grainger Branch-based Net sales were $5,678.8 million for 2008, an increase of $326.3 million, or 6.1%, when compared with net sales of $5,352.5 million for 2007. Daily sales were up 5.7%. Daily sales in the United States were up 5.5%. Sales were led by high single-digit sales growth in the government sector, and mid single-digit sales growth in the commercial and 12 reseller sectors. Approximately 2 percentage points of the sales growth came from Grainger product line expansion initiative and approximately 4 percentage points came from price and volume. Sales volume was negatively affected by approximately 1 percentage point due to a decline in sales of seasonal products. In 2004, Grainger launched a multiyear market expansion program to strengthen its presence in top metropolitan markets and better position itself to serve local customers. The market expansion program was completed in 2008, however, the benefits realized from this initiative are expected to continue. Consistent with the overall downturn in the economy, beginning in October most of these markets saw negative sales growth, which significantly affected sales growth for 2008. Results for the market expansion program were as follows: Daily Sales Increase 2008 vs. 2007 Phase 1 (Atlanta, Denver, Seattle) 7% Phase 2 (Four markets in Southern California) 5% Phase 3 (Houston, St. Louis, Tampa) 10% Phase 4 (Baltimore, Cincinnati, Kansas City, Miami, Philadelphia, Washington, D.C.) 2% Phase 5 (Dallas, Detroit, New York, Phoenix) 3% Phase 6 (Chicago, Minneapolis, Pittsburgh, San Francisco) 6% Over the past three years, Grainger has added over 150,000 new products to supplement Industrial Supply plumbing, fastener, material handling and security product lines as part of its ongoing product line expansion initiative. The most recent catalog, issued in 2009, offers a total of 237,000 products, an increase of 50,000 products over the 2008 catalog. Sales in Mexico increased 11.9% in 2008 versus 2007. Daily sales were up 11.5%. In local currency, daily sales were up 12.7%, driven primarily by increased market share coming from the ongoing branch expansion program. The segment gross profit margin increased 0.5 percentage point in 2008 over 2007, driven primarily by positive inflation recovery, partially offset by unfavorable selling price category mix. Operating expenses in this segment were up 3.4% in 2008. Expenses grew at a slower rate than sales primarily due to lower advertising expenses, bonus accruals, severance and lower bad debt expense, the result of improved collection efficiency. For the segment, operating earnings of $782.7 million for 2008 increased 16.9% over the $669.4 million for 2007. This earnings improvement exceeded the sales growth rate due to an improved gross profit margin and positive operating expense leverage. Acklands Grainger Branch-based Net sales at Acklands Grainger were $728.0 million for 2008, an increase of $91.5 million, or 14.4%, when compared with $636.5 million for 2007. Daily sales were up 13.9%. In local currency, daily sales increased 13.1%. The increase was led by sales growth in the contractor, agriculture and mining and government sectors. The gross profit margin increased 0.3 percentage points in 2008 over 2007. The improvement in the gross profit margin was primarily due to positive inflation recovery. Operating expenses were up 13.7% in 2008. The increase in operating expenses was primarily due to payroll and benefits as a result of increased headcount, merit increases and commissions, and higher advertising and occupancy expenses, and expenses related to the bankruptcy of a provider of freight payment services. Operating earnings of $54.3 million for 2008 were up $10.0 million, or 22.7%. This earnings improvement exceeded the sales growth rate due to an improved gross profit margin and operating expenses that grew at a slower rate than sales. Lab Safety Net sales at Lab Safety were $450.7 million for 2008, an increase of $16.0 million, or 3.7%, when compared with $434.7 million for 2007. Daily sales were up 3.3%. Excluding sales from the Highsmith acquisition, sales declined 3.3%. The gross profit margin decreased 0.6 percentage point in 2008 over 2007, driven primarily by unfavorable selling price category mix and product mix. Operating expenses were up 10.0% in 2008. Expenses grew at a faster rate than sales primarily due to costs associated with the Highsmith acquisition. Operating earnings of $45.4 million for 2008 were down 16.4% over 2007. Operating earnings were down as a result of lower gross profit margins and higher operating expenses. 13 Other Income and Expense Other income and expense was $9.5 million of expense in 2008, a decrease of $20.7 million as compared with $11.2 million of income in 2007. The following table summarizes the components of other income and expense (in thousands of dollars): For the Years Ended December 31, 2008 2007 Other income and (expense): Interest income (expense) net $ (9,416 ) $ 9,151 Equity in net income of unconsolidated entities 3,642 2,016 Write-off of investment in unconsolidated entity (6,031 ) Unclassified net 2,351 41 $ (9,454 ) $ 11,208 The change from net interest income to net interest expense was primarily attributable to the four-year bank term loan obtained in May 2008. The write-off of the investment relates to Asia Pacific Brands as described in Note 6 to the Consolidated Financial Statements. Unclassified net increased primarily due to higher foreign exchange transaction gains. Income Taxes Income taxes of $297.9 million in 2008 increased 13.8% as compared with $261.7 million in 2007. Grainger effective tax rates were 38.5% and 38.4% in 2008 and 2007, respectively. Excluding the effect of after tax items related to the write-off and the earnings of unconsolidated entities, the effective income tax rates were 38.4% and 38.5% for 2008 and 2007, respectively. For 2009, Grainger is projecting its estimated effective tax rate to be approximately 38.9%, excluding equity in net income of unconsolidated entities. 2007 Compared to 2006 Grainger net sales of $6,418.0 million for 2007 increased 9.1% when compared with net sales of $5,883.7 million for 2006. There was one more selling day in 2007 versus 2006. Daily sales were up 8.7%. The increase in net sales was led by sales growth in the upper teens in the government sector, high single-digit sales growth in the commercial sector and mid single-digit sales growth in the manufacturing sector. Approximately 3 percentage points of the sales growth came from Grainger ongoing strategic initiatives, market expansion and product line expansion, with another 1 percentage point from foreign exchange. Partially offsetting these sales improvements was a negative 1 percentage point effect from the continued wind-down of low margin integrated supply contracts. Refer to the Segment Analysis below for further detail of Grainger ongoing strategic initiatives. The gross profit margin for 2007 improved 0.6 percentage point to 40.6% from 40.0% in 2006. The improvement in the gross profit margin was primarily driven by positive inflation recovery, partially offset by unfavorable selling price category mix. Operating earnings for 2007 totaled $670.7 million, an increase of 16.0% over 2006. This earnings improvement exceeded the sales growth rate due to an improved gross profit margin and operating expenses which grew at a slightly slower rate than sales. Net earnings for 2007 increased by 9.6% to $420.1 million from $383.4 million in 2006. The growth in net earnings for 2007 primarily resulted from the improvement in operating earnings, partially offset by lower interest income, no counterpart to a gain on the sale of Acklands Grainger interest in the USI-AGI Prairies joint venture in 2006, and a higher effective tax rate in 2007. The results for 2006 included tax benefits from the resolution of uncertainties related to the audit of the 2004 tax year and a tax benefit from a reduction of deferred tax liabilities related to property, buildings and equipment. These benefits increased diluted earnings per share by $0.15 in 2006. Diluted earnings per share of $4.94 in 2007 were 16.5% higher than the $4.24 for 2006. This improvement was higher than the percentage increase for net earnings due to the effect of Grainger share repurchase program. Segment Analysis The following comments at the segment level include external and intersegment net sales and operating earnings. Comments at the business unit level include external and inter- and intrasegment net sales and operating earnings. See Note 18 to the Consolidated Financial Statements. 14 Grainger Branch-based Net sales were $5,352.5 million for 2007, an increase of $441.7 million, or 9.0%, when compared with net sales of $4,910.8 million for 2006. Daily sales were up 8.6%. Daily sales in the United States were up 8.5%, with growth in all customer end markets, led by sales growth in the upper teens in the government sector and high single-digit sales growth in the commercial sector. Approximately 4 percentage points of the sales growth came from Grainger ongoing strategic initiatives, market expansion and product line expansion. The wind-down of Grainger low margin integrated supply contracts reduced sales growth by approximately 1 percentage point. In 2004, Grainger launched a multiyear market expansion program to strengthen its presence in top metropolitan markets and better position itself to serve local customers. Market expansion contributed approximately 2 percentage points to the sales growth for the segment. Results for the market expansion program were as follows: Daily Sales Increase 2007 vs. 2006 Estimated Percent Complete Phase 1 (Atlanta, Denver, Seattle) 15% 100% Phase 2 (Four markets in Southern California) 6% 100% Phase 3 (Houston, St. Louis, Tampa) 13% 100% Phase 4 (Baltimore, Cincinnati, Kansas City, Miami, Philadelphia, Washington, D.C.) 10% 100% Phase 5 (Dallas, Detroit, New York, Phoenix) 9% 75% Phase 6 (Chicago, Minneapolis, Pittsburgh, San Francisco) 9% 65% Product line expansion contributed approximately 2 percentage points to the growth in the segment. Over the past two years, Grainger has added approximately 90,000 new products in the plumbing, fastener, material handling and security product lines as part of its ongoing product line expansion initiative. Daily sales in Mexico increased 22.7% in 2007 versus 2006. In local currency, daily sales were up 22.8%, driven primarily by the ongoing branch expansion program and an improved economy. The segment gross profit margin increased 0.4 percentage point in 2007 over 2006, driven primarily by positive inflation recovery, partially offset by unfavorable selling price category mix. Operating expenses in this segment were up 9.0% in 2007. Expenses grew at the same rate as sales with payroll and benefits growing at a slower rate than sales offset by other operating expenses growing faster than sales, primarily due to increased bad debt expense and provisions and higher facility costs related to market expansion. For the segment, operating earnings of $669.4 million for 2007 increased 12.8% over the $593.5 million for 2006. This earnings improvement exceeded the sales growth rate due to an improved gross profit margin. Acklands Grainger Branch-based Net sales at Acklands Grainger were $636.5 million for 2007, an increase of $71.4 million, or 12.6%, when compared with $565.1 million for 2006. Daily sales were up 12.2%. In local currency, daily sales increased 5.8% due to a stronger economy. This increase was led by the mining sector with sales growth in the low twenties, high single-digit sales growth in the oil sector and mid single-digit sales growth in the government sector. These increases were partially offset by a mid-teens sales decline in the forestry sector. The gross profit margin increased 2.6 percentage points in 2007 over 2006. The improvement in the gross profit margin was primarily due to positive inflation recovery. Operating expenses were up 6.7% in 2007. Expenses grew at a slower rate than sales due to operating expense leverage, the result of improved cost management and lower severance costs. Operating earnings of $44.2 million for 2007 were up $29.0 million, or 190%. This earnings improvement exceeded the sales growth rate due to an improved gross profit margin and operating expenses that grew at a slower rate than sales. Lab Safety Net sales at Lab Safety were $434.7 million for 2007, an increase of $23.2 million, or 5.6%, when compared with $411.5 million for 2006. Daily sales were up 5.2%. Sales from the acquisitions made during 2007 and late 2006 contributed 6.1 percentage points to the growth. The gross profit margin decreased 0.5 percentage point in 2007 over 2006. Gross profit margin was down as a result of increased freight costs and unfavorable selling price category mix and product mix, partially offset by positive inflation recovery. Operating expenses were 4.6% higher in 2007 and grew at a slower rate than sales due to cost management efforts. Operating earnings of $54.3 million for 2007 were up 3.8% over 2006. This earnings improvement was less than the sales growth rate primarily due to a lower gross profit margin. 15 Other Income and Expense Other income and expense was $11.2 million of income in 2007, a decrease of $13.8 million as compared with $25.0 million of income in 2006. The following table summarizes the components of other income and expense (in thousands of dollars): For the Years Ended December 31, 2007 2006 Other income and (expense): Interest income (expense) net $ 9,151 $ 19,570 Equity in net income of unconsolidated entities 2,016 2,960 Gain on sale of unconsolidated entity 2,291 Unclassified net 41 131 $ 11,208 $ 24,952 The decrease in interest income was primarily attributable to lower average cash balances due to working capital needs and share repurchases. There was a decrease in equity in net income of unconsolidated entities in 2007 versus 2006 primarily driven by the absence of earnings related to the joint venture that was sold. Income Taxes Income taxes of $261.7 million in 2007 increased 19.2% as compared with $219.6 million in 2006. Grainger effective tax rates were 38.4% and 36.4% in 2007 and 2006, respectively. Excluding the equity in net income of unconsolidated entities, the effective income tax rates were 38.5% for 2007 and 36.7% for 2006. The 2006 tax rate benefited from resolution of uncertainties related to the audit of the 2004 tax year and from a reduction of deferred tax liabilities related to property, buildings and equipment. Excluding the equity in net income of unconsolidated entities and the tax benefits noted above, the effective income tax rate for 2006 was 38.9%. Financial Condition Grainger expects its strong working capital position, cash flows from operations and borrowing capacity to continue, allowing it to fund its operations, including growth initiatives, capital expenditures, acquisitions and repurchase of shares, as well as pay cash dividends. Cash Flow Net cash flows from operations of $530.1 million in 2008, $468.9 million in 2007 and $436.8 million in 2006 continued to improve Grainger financial position and serve as the primary source of funding. Net cash provided by operations increased $61.2 million in 2008 over 2007, driven primarily by increased net earnings. The Change in operating assets and liabilities net of business acquisitions used cash of $143.1 million in 2008. This use of cash was driven primarily by an increase in inventory due to the product line expansion initiative. The increase in net cash flows from operations from 2006 to 2007 of $32.1 million was primarily attributable to increased net earnings. The Change in operating assets and liabilities net of business acquisitions used cash of $106.4 million in 2007. This use of cash was primarily driven by increases in inventory and trade accounts receivable as well as a decrease in trade accounts payable due to the timing of payments at year-end. The increases in inventory and trade accounts receivable were due to product line expansion and increased sales. These changes were partially offset by an increase in other current liabilities due to higher compensation, benefit and profit sharing accruals, the result of increased headcount and improved Company performance. Net cash flows used in investing activities were $202.6 million, $197.0 million and $139.7 million in 2008, 2007 and 2006, respectively. Cash expended for property, buildings, equipment and capitalized software was $195.0 million, $197.4 million and $136.8 million in 2008, 2007 and 2006, respectively. Additional information regarding capital spending is detailed in the Capital Expenditures section below. In 2008, Grainger continued to fund the Company market expansion initiative ($40 million) and acquired two companies, Highsmith and Excel ($34.3 million). In 2007, Grainger funded the market expansion initiative ($88 million), purchased McFeely ($4.7 million) and purchased its distribution center in China ($6.7 million). Net cash flows used in financing activities for 2008, 2007 and 2006 were $36.8 million, $513.9 million and $492.9 million, respectively. Treasury stock purchases were $394.2 million in 2008 as Grainger repurchased 5.5 million shares compared to purchases of $647.3 million in 2007 to repurchase 7.2 million shares. As of December 31, 2008, approximately 7.4 million shares of common stock remained available under Grainger repurchase authorization. Dividends paid to shareholders were $121.5 million in 2008 versus $113.1 million in 2007. Grainger also used cash in 16 financing activities to pay off $81.4 million of short-term borrowings versus an increase in short-term borrowings of $102.3 million in 2007. Partially offsetting these cash outlays were proceeds of long-term borrowings of $500 million in 2008, as well as proceeds and excess tax benefits realized from stock options exercised of $60.4 million in 2008 versus $144.2 million in 2007. Treasury stock purchases were $472.8 million for 7.0 million shares and dividends paid to shareholders were $97.9 million in 2006. Partially offsetting these cash outlays was proceeds and excess tax benefits realized from stock options exercised of $77.8 million for 2006. Working Capital Internally generated funds have been the primary source of working capital and of funds used in business expansion, supplemented by debt as circumstances dictated. In addition, funds were expended for facilities optimization and enhancements to support growth initiatives, as well as for business and systems development and other infrastructure improvements. Working capital was $1,382.4 million at December 31, 2008, compared with $974.4 million at December 31, 2007 and $1,155.8 million at December 31, 2006. At these dates, the ratio of current assets to current liabilities was 2.8, 2.2 and 2.6. The increase in the current ratio and working capital for 2008 primarily relates to increases in cash and inventories and the replacement of short-term borrowings with long-term borrowings. Capital Expenditures In each of the past three years, a portion of operating cash flow has been used for additions to property, buildings, equipment and capitalized software as summarized in the following table (in thousands of dollars): For the Years Ended December 31, 2008 2007 2006 Land, buildings, structures and improvements $ 107,688 $ 100,380 $ 67,554 Furniture, fixtures, machinery and equipment 76,163 87,389 62,233 Subtotal 183,851 187,769 129,787 Capitalized software 12,297 8,556 8,950 Total $ 196,148 $ 196,325 $ 138,737 In 2008, Grainger completed its investments in the market expansion program in the United States which realigned branches in the top 25 major metropolitan areas. In addition, there was continued international investment, including branch expansion in Mexico, as well as the normal recurring replacement of equipment. In 2007 and 2006, Grainger investments included the market expansion program, Mexico and China expansion and the normal recurring replacement of equipment. Capital expenditures are expected to range from $175 million to $200 million in 2009. Projected investments include improved infrastructure in distribution centers, both in the U.S. and Canada, information technology, including upgraded electronic commerce platforms, and the normal recurring replacement of equipment. Grainger expects to fund 2009 capital investments from operating cash flows. Debt Grainger maintains a debt ratio and liquidity position that provides flexibility in funding working capital needs and long-term cash requirements. In addition to internally generated funds, Grainger has various sources of financing available, including bank borrowings under lines of credit. A four-year bank term loan of $500 million was obtained in May 2008. At December 31, 2008, Grainger long-term debt rating by Standard & Poor was AA+. Grainger available lines of credit, as further discussed in Note 8 to the Consolidated Financial Statements, were $250.0 million at December 31, 2008, 2007 and 2006. Total debt as a percent of total capitalization was 20.7%, 5.0% and 0.4% as of the same dates. The increase in total debt as a percent of total capitalization in 2008 was primarily the result of the $500 million bank term loan. Grainger believes any circumstances that would trigger early payment or acceleration with respect to any outstanding debt securities would not have a material impact on its results of operations or financial position. 17 Commitments and Other Contractual Obligations At December 31, 2008, Grainger contractual obligations, including estimated payments due by period, are as follows (in thousands of dollars) : Payments Due by Period Total Amounts Committed Less than 1 Year 1 3 Years 4 5 Years More than 5 Years Long-term debt obligations $ 509,485 $ 21,257 $ 100,728 $ 387,500 $ Interest on long-term debt 18,538 6,130 10,782 1,626 Operating lease obligations 218,375 41,150 66,471 49,917 60,837 Purchase obligations: Uncompleted additions to property, buildings and equipment 17,916 17,916 Commitments to purchase inventory 187,526 187,498 28 Other purchase obligations 80,938 68,665 11,181 1,092 Other liabilities 171,489 7,408 15,181 17,329 131,571 Total $ 1,204,267 $ 350,024 $ 204,371 $ 457,464 $ 192,408 Purchase obligations for inventory are made in the normal course of business to meet operating needs. While purchase orders for both inventory purchases and noninventory purchases are generally cancelable without penalty, certain vendor agreements provide for cancellation fees or penalties depending on the terms of the contract. Other liabilities represent future benefit payments for postretirement benefit plans and postemployment disability medical benefits as determined by actuarial projections. Other employment-related benefits costs of $31.0 million have not been included in this table as the timing of benefit payments is not statistically predictable. See Note 10 to the Consolidated Financial Statements. See also Notes 9 and 11 to the Consolidated Financial Statements for further detail related to the interest on long-term debt and operating lease obligations, respectively. Grainger has recorded a noncurrent liability of $26.3 million for tax uncertainties and interest at December 31, 2008. This amount is excluded from the table above, as Grainger cannot make reliable estimates of these cash flows by period. See Note 15 to the Consolidated Financial Statements. Off-Balance Sheet Arrangements Grainger does not have any material exposures to off-balance sheet arrangements. Grainger does not have any variable interest entities or activities that include non-exchange-traded contracts accounted for at fair value. Critical Accounting Estimates The preparation of financial statements, in conformity with accounting principles generally accepted in the United States of America, requires management to make judgments, estimates and assumptions that affect the reported amounts of assets, liabilities, revenues and expenses in the financial statements. Management bases its estimates on historical experience and other assumptions, which it believes are reasonable. If actual amounts are ultimately different from these estimates, the revisions are included in Grainger results of operations for the period in which the actual amounts become known. Accounting policies are considered critical when they require management to make assumptions about matters that are highly uncertain at the time the estimates are made and when there are different estimates that management reasonably could have made, which would have a material impact on the presentation of Grainger financial condition, changes in financial condition or results of operations. Note 2 to the Consolidated Financial Statements describes the significant accounting policies used in the preparation of the Consolidated Financial Statements. The most significant areas involving management judgments and estimates follow. Actual results in these areas could differ materially from management estimates under different assumptions or conditions. Allowance for Doubtful Accounts . Grainger uses several factors to estimate the allowance for uncollectible accounts receivable including the age of the receivables and the historical ratio of actual write-offs to the age of the receivables. The analyses performed also take into consideration economic conditions that may have an impact on a specific industry, group of customers or a specific customer. 18 Write-offs could be materially different than the reserves provided if economic conditions change or actual results deviate from historical trends. Inventory Reserves. Grainger establishes inventory reserves for shrinkage and excess and obsolete inventory. Provisions for inventory shrinkage are based on historical experience to account for unmeasured usage or loss. Actual inventory shrinkage could be materially different from these estimates, affecting Grainger inventory values and cost of merchandise sold. Grainger regularly reviews inventory to evaluate continued demand and identify any obsolete or excess quantities of inventory. Grainger records provisions for the difference between excess and obsolete inventory and its estimated realizable value. Estimated realizable value is based on anticipated future product demand, market conditions and liquidation values. Actual results differing from these projections could have a material effect on Grainger results of operations. Stock Incentive Plans. Grainger maintains stock incentive plans under which a variety of incentive grants may be awarded to employees and directors. Grainger uses a binomial lattice option pricing model to estimate the value of stock option grants. The model requires projections of the risk-free interest rate, expected life, volatility, expected dividend yield and forfeiture rate of the stock option grants. The fair value estimate of options granted used the following assumptions: For the Years Ended December 31, 2008 2007 2006 Risk-free interest rate 3.2 % 4.6 % 4.9 % Expected life 6 years 6 years 6 years Expected volatility 25.2 % 24.3 % 23.9 % Expected dividend yield 1.8 % 1.7 % 1.5 % The risk-free interest rate is selected based on yields from U.S. Treasury zero-coupon issues with a remaining term approximately equal to the expected term of the options being valued. The expected life selected for options granted during each year presented represents the period of time that the options are expected to be outstanding based on historical data of option holders exercise and termination behavior. Expected volatility is based upon implied and historical volatility of the closing price of Grainger stock over a period equal to the expected life of each option grant. The dividend yield assumption is based on history and expectation of dividend payouts. Because stock option compensation expense is based on awards ultimately expected to vest, it has been reduced for estimated forfeitures, using historical forfeiture experience. The amount of stock option compensation expense is significantly affected by the valuation model and these assumptions. If a different valuation model or different assumptions were used, the stock option compensation expense could be significantly different from what is recorded in the current period. Compensation expense for other stock-based awards is based upon the closing market price on the last trading date preceding the date of the grant. For additional information concerning stock incentive plans, see Note 12 to the Consolidated Financial Statements. Postretirement Healthcare Benefits . Postretirement healthcare obligations and net periodic costs are dependent on assumptions and estimates used in calculating such amounts. The assumptions used include, among others, discount rates, assumed rates of return on plan assets and healthcare cost trend rates. Changes in assumptions (caused by conditions in equity markets or plan experience, for example) could have a material effect on Grainger postretirement benefit obligations and expense, and could affect its results of operations and financial condition. These changes in assumptions may also affect voluntary decisions to make additional contributions to the trust established for funding the postretirement benefit obligation. The discount rate assumptions used by management reflect the rates available on high-quality fixed income debt instruments as of December 31, the measurement date, of each year. A lower discount rate increases the present value of benefit obligations and net periodic postretirement benefit costs. As of December 31, 2008, Grainger decreased the discount rate used in the calculation of its postretirement plan obligation from 6.5% to 5.9% to reflect the decrease in market interest rates. Grainger estimates that the decrease in the expected discount rate will decrease 2009 pretax earnings by approximately $2.5 million, although other changes in assumptions may increase, decrease or eliminate this effect. Grainger considers the long-term historical actual return on plan assets and the historical performance of the Standard & Poor 500 Index in developing its expected long-term return on plan assets. In 2008, Grainger maintained the expected long-term rate of return on plan assets of 6.0% (net of tax at 40%) based on the historical average of long-term rates of return. 19 A 1 percentage point change in assumed healthcare cost trend rates would have had the following effects on December 31, 2008 results (in thousands of dollars): 1 Percentage Point Increase (Decrease) Effect on total of service and interest cost $ 4,206 $ (3,293 ) Effect on accumulated postretirement benefitobligation 37,268 (29,601 ) Grainger may terminate or modify the postretirement plan at any time, subject to the provisions of the Employee Retirement Income Security Act of 1974 (ERISA) and the Internal Revenue Code, as amended. In the event the postretirement plan is terminated, all assets of the Group Benefit Trust inure to the benefit of the participants. The foregoing assumptions are based on the presumption that the postretirement plan will continue. Were the postretirement plan to terminate, different actuarial assumptions and other factors might be applicable. Grainger has used its best judgment in making assumptions and estimates and believes such assumptions and estimates used are appropriate. Changes to the assumptions may be required in future years as a result of actual experience or new trends and, therefore, may affect Grainger retirement plan obligations and future expense. For additional information concerning postretirement healthcare benefits, see Note 10 to the Consolidated Financial Statements. Insurance Reserves. Grainger retains a significant portion of the risk of certain losses related to workers compensation, general liability and property losses through the utilization of high deductibles and self-insured retentions. There are also certain other risk areas for which Grainger does not maintain insurance. Grainger is responsible for establishing accounting policies on insurance reserves. Although it relies on outside parties to project future claims costs, it retains control over actuarial assumptions, including loss development factors and claim payment patterns. Grainger performs ongoing reviews of its insured and uninsured risks, which it uses to establish the appropriate reserve levels. The use of assumptions in the analysis leads to fluctuations in required reserves over time. Any change in the required reserve balance is reflected in the current period results of operations. Income Taxes. Grainger recognizes deferred tax assets and liabilities for the expected future tax consequences of events that have been included in the financial statements or tax returns. Under this method, deferred tax assets and liabilities are determined based on the differences between the financial reporting and tax bases of assets and liabilities, using enacted tax rates in effect for the year in which the differences are expected to reverse. The tax balances and income tax expense recognized by Grainger are based on management interpretations of the tax laws of multiple jurisdictions. Income tax expense reflects Grainger best estimates and assumptions regarding, among other items, the level of future taxable income, interpretation of tax laws and tax planning opportunities. Future rulings by tax authorities and future changes in tax laws and their interpretation, changes in projected levels of taxable income and future tax planning strategies could impact the actual effective tax rate and tax balances recorded by Grainger. Other. Other significant accounting policies, not involving the same level of measurement uncertainties as those discussed above, are nevertheless important to an understanding of the financial statements. Policies such as revenue recognition, depreciation, intangibles, long-lived assets and warranties require judgments on complex matters that are often subject to multiple external sources of authoritative guidance such as the Financial Accounting Standards Board and the Securities and Exchange Commission. Possible changes in estimates or assumptions associated with these policies are not expected to have a material effect on the financial condition or results of operations of Grainger. More information on these additional accounting policies can be found in Note 2 to the Consolidated Financial Statements. New Accounting Standards The following new accounting standards exclude those pronouncements that are unlikely to have an effect on Grainger upon adoption. In December 2007, the FASB issued SFAS No. 141 (revised 2007), "Business Combinations" (SFAS No. 141R). SFAS No. 141R establishes principles and requirements for how an acquirer recognizes and measures in its financial statements the identifiable assets acquired, the liabilities assumed, any noncontrolling interest in the acquiree and the goodwill acquired. SFAS No. 141R also establishes disclosure requirements to enable the evaluation of the nature and financial effects of the business combination. The statement is effective for fiscal years beginning after December 15, 2008, and will be applied to acquisitions after adoption by the Company. In December 2007, the FASB issued SFAS No. 160, "Noncontrolling Interests in Consolidated Financial Statements an amendment of Accounting Research Bulletin No. 51" (SFAS No. 160). SFAS No. 160 establishes accounting and reporting standards for ownership interests in subsidiaries held by parties other than the parent, the amount of consolidated net income attributable to the parent and to the noncontrolling interest, changes in a parent's ownership interest and the valuation of retained noncontrolling equity investments when a subsidiary is deconsolidated. SFAS No.160 also establishes disclosure requirements that clearly identify and distinguish between the interests of the 20 parent and the interests of the noncontrolling owners. The statement is effective for fiscal years beginning after December 15, 2008. The Company currently does not have any noncontrolling interest in consolidated financial statements, therefore does not expect the adoption of SFAS No. 160 to have a material effect on its results of operations or financial position. In June 2008, the FASB issued Staff Position EITF 03-6-1, Determining Whether Instruments Granted in Share-Based Payment Transactions Are Participating Securities (FSP 03-6-1). FSP 03-6-1 states that unvested share-based payment awards that contain nonforfeitable rights to dividends or dividend equivalents (whether paid or unpaid) are participating securities and shall be included in the computation of earnings per share pursuant to the two-class method. Upon adoption, a company is required to retrospectively adjust its earnings per share data presentation to conform with the FSP 03-6-1 provisions. FSP 03-6-1 is effective for fiscal years beginning after December 15, 2008. The Company unvested share-based payment awards, such as Performance Shares, Restricted Stock and Restricted Stock Units (see Note 12 to the Consolidated Financial Statements) that contain nonforfeitable rights to dividends meet the criteria of a participating security as defined by FSP 03-6-1. Accordingly, the adoption of FSP 03-6-1 will change the methodology of computing the Company earnings per share to the two-class method. This change will not affect previously reported consolidated net earnings or net cash flows from operations. Under the two-class method, earnings will be allocated between common stock and participating securities, resulting in lower earnings per share. Refer to the table below for further analysis of the impact adoption would have had on 2008 earnings per share. 2008 Quarter Ended Mar. 31 June 30 Sept. 30 Dec. 31 Total Earnings Per Share as previously reported Basic $ 1.47 $ 1.48 $ 1.84 $ 1.42 $ 6.21 Diluted $ 1.43 $ 1.43 $ 1.79 $ 1.39 $ 6.04 Earnings Per Share Two-class method Basic $ 1.44 $ 1.44 $ 1.80 $ 1.39 $ 6.07 Diluted $ 1.41 $ 1.42 $ 1.77 $ 1.37 $ 5.97 See Note 2 to the Consolidated Financial Statements for further discussion of new accounting standards. Inflation and Changing Prices Inflation during the last three years has not had a significant effect on operations. The predominant use of the last-in, first-out (LIFO) method of accounting for inventories and accelerated depreciation methods for financial reporting and income tax purposes result in a substantial recognition of the effects of inflation in the financial statements. The major impact of inflation is on buildings and improvements, where the gap between historic cost and replacement cost accumulates for these long-lived assets. The related depreciation expense associated with these assets would likely increase if adjustments were to be made for the cumulative effect of inflation. Grainger believes the most positive means to combat inflation and advance the interests of investors lies in the continued application of basic business principles, which include improving productivity, maintaining working capital turnover and offering products and services which can command appropriate prices in the marketplace. Forward-Looking Statements This Form 10-K contains statements that are not historical in nature but concern future results and business plans, strategies and objectives and other matters that may be deemed to be forward-looking statements under the federal securities laws. Grainger has generally identified such forward-looking statements by using words such as anticipate, anticipated, assumed, assumes, assumption, assumptions, believe, believes, contingency, continue, continued, continues, could, estimate, estimated, estimates, expect, expectation, expected, expects, forecasts, intended, intends, may, might, percent complete, planned, predict, predictable, predicted, presumption, project, projected, projecting, projection, projections, potential, reasonably likely, scheduled, should, unlikely, will, and would or similar expressions. Grainger cannot guarantee that any forward-looking statement will be realized, although Grainger does believe that its assumptions underlying its forward-looking statements are reasonable. Achievement of future results is subject to risks and uncertainties which could cause Grainger results to differ materially from those which are presented. Factors that could cause actual results to differ materially from those presented or implied in a forward-looking statement include, without limitation: higher product costs or other expenses; a major loss of customers; loss or disruption of source of supply; increased competitive pricing pressures; failure to develop or implement new technologies or business strategies; the outcome of pending and future litigation or governmental or regulatory proceedings; investigations, inquiries, audits and changes in laws and regulations; disruption of information technology or data security systems; general industry or market conditions; general global economic conditions; currency exchange rate fluctuations; market volatility; commodity price volatility; labor shortages; facilities disruptions or shutdowns; higher fuel costs or disruptions in transportation services; natural and other catastrophes; unanticipated weather conditions; and the factors identified in Item 1A, Risk Factors. 21 Caution should be taken not to place undue reliance on Grainger forward-looking statements and Grainger undertakes no obligation to publicly update the forward-looking statements, whether as a result of new information, future events or otherwise.
