ITEM 7. MANAGEMENT S DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS OF FINANCIAL CONDITION AND RESULTS OF OPERATIONS The following Management Discussion and Analysis (MD&A) is intended to help the reader understand our results of operations and financial condition. MD&A is provided as a supplement to, and should be read in conjunction with, our audited Consolidated Financial Statements and the accompanying notes to the Consolidated Financial Statements and other disclosures included in this Annual Report on Form 10-K (including the disclosures under Item 1A. Risk Factors ). Our Consolidated Financial Statements have been prepared in accordance with U.S. generally accepted accounting principles and are presented in U.S. dollars. Management Overview We are a biopharmaceutical company that discovers, develops and commercializes innovative therapeutics in areas of unmet medical need. Our mission is to advance the care of patients suffering from life threatening diseases worldwide. Headquartered in Foster City, California, we have operations in North America, Europe and Australia. We market Truvada (emtricitabine and tenofovir disoproxil fumarate), Atripla (efavirenz 600 mg/emtricitabine 200 mg/tenofovir disoproxil fumarate 300 mg), Viread (tenofovir disoproxil fumarate) and Emtriva (emtricitabine) for the treatment of human immunodeficiency virus (HIV) infection; Hepsera (adefovir dipivoxil) and Viread for the treatment of chronic hepatitis B virus (HBV); AmBisome (amphotericin B) liposome for injection for the treatment of severe fungal infections; Letairis (ambrisentan) for the treatment of pulmonary arterial hypertension (PAH); Vistide (cidofovir injection) for the treatment of cytomegalovirus infection; and Flolan (epoprostenol sodium) for the treatment of pulmonary hypertension. F. Hoffmann-La Roche Ltd (together with Hoffmann-La Roche Inc., Roche) markets Tamiflu (oseltamivir phosphate) for the treatment of influenza under a royalty-paying collaborative agreement with us. OSI Pharmaceuticals, Inc. markets Macugen (pegaptanib sodium injection) in the United States and Europe for the treatment of neovascular age-related macular degeneration under a royalty-paying collaborative agreement with us. GlaxoSmithKline Inc. (GSK) markets Volibris (ambrisentan) outside of the United States for the treatment of PAH under a royalty-paying collaborative agreement with us. Business Highlights During 2008, we made significant progress in various areas of our business. We grew our product sales significantly, executed on product approvals and product launches in multiple territories, made progress on moving our product candidates forward and continued to strengthen our worldwide organization and infrastructure to support our expanded international footprint and business activities. Our commercial achievements for the year included the continued rollout of Atripla in the European Union (EU), driving growth of Atripla and Truvada in the United States and Canada, launching Viread for hepatitis B in the EU and the United States, making gains in the PAH market with Letairis, as well as continuing the expansion of our sales and marketing infrastructure, including the establishment of new international marketing subsidiaries. During the year, we received marketing authorization for Viread for the treatment of chronic hepatitis B in adults in all 27 member states of the European Union, Turkey, New Zealand, Australia, the United States and Canada. Along with the marketing approvals we received in 2008, we made significant advances on the compounds and product candidates in our research and development (R&D) pipeline, including: In the HIV area, we received positive feedback from the U.S. Food and Drug Administration (FDA) during the latter part of the year, regarding our development plans for elvitegravir, our novel integrase inhibitor for HIV which we licensed from Japan Tobacco Inc. in 2005; GS 9350, our pharmacoenhancer that is in development as a boosting agent for certain HIV medicines; and our single 44 Table of Contents tablet fixed dose regimen of elvitegravir, GS 9350 and Truvada. The FDA agreed with our proposal to simultaneously develop these three product candidates, allowing us to eventually support three separate new drug application (NDA) filings with four Phase 3 clinical studies: one study for elvitegravir, two studies for the single tablet fixed dose regimen mentioned above, and one study for GS 9350. As a result of this proposal, we will be combining the second of our two previously planned Phase 3 studies for elvitegravir with the first Phase 3 elvitegravir study which we began dosing in the third quarter of 2008. In hepatitis C, we completed dosing of patients in the continuation of the Phase 1b study of GS 9190, a non-nucleoside polymerase inhibitor, and began enrolling the Phase 2 study in patients infected with the hepatitis C virus. During the year, we completed our Phase 2a study of GS 9450, the caspase inhibitor we licensed from LG Life Sciences in 2007, and expect to initiate the Phase 2b study in the second quarter of 2009 to evaluate the longer term safety and efficacy of GS 9450. We are enrolling patients with nonalcoholic steadohepatitis in a Phase 2a study of GS 9450 to evaluate its safety and effect on liver enzymes and anticipate having data from this study before the end of 2009. In the cardiovascular area, we completed enrollment of one of our two Phase 3 studies for darusentan for the treatment of resistant hypertension and we anticipate having data from this study in the second quarter of 2009. We continued to enroll patients in our second Phase 3 study for darusentan, and we anticipate completing the enrollment before the end of 2009 with data available in early 2010. We are developing cicletanine for PAH and expect to initiate a Phase 2 clinical trial examining both once daily and twice daily dosing in early 2009. We are also preparing to initiate a Phase 3 study of ambrisentan in patients with pulmonary hypertension in idiopathic pulmonary fibrosis in the second quarter of 2009. In the respiratory area, we submitted an NDA for aztreonam for inhalation solution for the treatment of cystic fibrosis (CF) to the FDA in November 2007. In September 2008, we received a complete response letter from the FDA informing us that the FDA will not approve our NDA for aztreonam for inhalation for the treatment of CF and requesting an additional Phase 3 clinical study. In November 2008, we filed a request for a formal dispute resolution with the FDA. In February 2009, in response to our appeal, the FDA notified us that it is reiterating its position that we will need to conduct another clinical study of aztreonam for inhalation solution before we can resubmit our NDA. We have also submitted a marketing authorization application (MAA) in the EU and received notice of acceptance and priority review by Health Canada for approval in Canada. We are still awaiting responses from the respective regulatory bodies. Also in the respiratory area, we began enrolling patients with non-CF bronchietasis in a Phase 2 study evaluating aztreonam for inhalation solution for this indication; we initiated a Phase 1 study in the fourth quarter of 2008 to evaluate the safety and tolerability of GS 9411, a novel epithelial sodium channel blocker designed to increase airway hydration for the treatment of pulmonary disease; and in the fourth quarter of 2008, we also initiated a Phase 2 study evaluating the safety and efficacy of GS 9310/11, an inhaled co-formulation of fosfomycin and tobramycin, for bacterial infections associated with CF. Financial Highlights Our operating results for the year were led by total product sales of $5.08 billion. Antiviral product sales (Truvada, Atripla, Viread, Hepsera and Emtriva) increased 36% to $4.67 billion in 2008 from $3.44 billion in 2007, and were the key drivers for total product sales growth of 36% for 2008 as compared to 2007. With the continued uptake of Atripla in the United States and product launches in Europe, Atripla contributed $1.57 billion, or 34%, to our total 2008 antiviral product sales. The growth of Atripla product sales and its increased proportion to overall product sales caused total product gross margin to decrease as expected to 78% in 2008 from 79% in 2007, due primarily to the efavirenz component of Atripla sales at zero gross margin. Truvada product sales for 2008 comprised $2.11 billion, or 45% of our total 2008 antiviral product sales. Truvada product sales for 2008 increased 33% from 2007 primarily due to continued sales volume growth as well as a favorable foreign currency exchange impact. Foreign currency fluctuations in 2008 had a favorable impact of approximately $148.2 million on total revenues and $92.6 million on pre-tax income when compared to 2007. 45 Table of Contents Royalty revenues that we recognized from our collaborations with corporate partners were $218.2 million in 2008, a decrease of 53% from royalty revenues of $468.2 million in 2007. The decrease in royalty revenues was due primarily to decreased Tamiflu sales by Roche related to pandemic planning initiatives worldwide. Operating expenses which include R&D, selling, general and administrative (SG&A) and purchased in-process research and development (IPR&D) expenses increased $233.2 million in 2008, or 18%, compared to 2007, reflecting the increased research and clinical study activity in our development pipeline, our expanded commercial activities worldwide, as well as the higher headcount, infrastructure and technology-related costs required to support the continued growth of our business. In 2008, we continued to be very focused on cost control and operating margins and will continue to do so in 2009. Our operating margin is impacted by the efavirenz component of a growing Atripla revenue stream and a declining trend for Tamiflu royalties. Cash, cash equivalents and marketable securities increased by $517.2 million during the year, driven primarily by our operating cash flows of $2.20 billion. Our strong cash position allowed us to complete two accelerated share repurchase transactions as well as make significant common stock repurchases from the open market under the $3.00 billion stock repurchase program authorized by our Board of Directors (Board) in October 2007, which expires in December 2010. During 2008, we repurchased a total of $1.97 billion under our stock repurchase program, or approximately 39.2 million shares. As of December 31, 2008, the remaining authorized amount of stock repurchases that may be made under the Board authorized stock repurchase program was $998.1 million. In light of the volatility and developments in the financial markets, we continued to review our cash equivalents and marketable securities carefully as well as invest prudently in 2008. Safety and preservation of principal and diversification of risk, as well as liquidity of investments sufficient to meet cash flow requirements, continued to be of primary importance to our investment goals. This approach helped protect us from the significant risks in the credit markets in 2008 while allowing us to meet our operating cash flow requirements and execute on other opportunities such as our share repurchases. 2009 Outlook We anticipate that the high level of productivity and financial performance experienced in 2008 will continue in 2009. Our operating objectives include the expansion of our commercial markets, both from a franchise perspective as well as leveraging the new international marketing subsidiaries that we have established in the last two years, reaching our significant R&D development timelines, continuing to strengthen our pipeline with internally developed and/or externally in-licensed or purchased opportunities and strengthening our key alliances. From a commercial standpoint, a number of internal and external initiatives may help promote the continued growth of our franchises. In the HIV area, we should be favorably impacted by the presentation of important data sets at upcoming medical conferences, continued testing and screening initiatives, and recent changes in HIV treatment guidelines. In the area of hepatitis B, a broad platform of educational activities concentrated in Asian American communities, highlighting the need to screen, diagnose and link patients to care, will help support Viread for HBV. In the United States, since the launch of Viread for HBV in August 2008, our hepatitis sales and medical affairs teams have concentrated their efforts solely on promotion of Viread. In the cardiovascular area, we will continue to build our presence within the PAH community and to support the growth of Letairis in 2009. We are mindful that conditions in our current macroeconomic environment could affect our ability to achieve our goals. Some of the factors that could affect our business include: the volatility in foreign currency exchange rates, government pricing pressures in both the United States and internationally, as well as changes in the financial health and/or practices of our significant business partners and customers. Although we have not yet seen significant changes, we will continue to monitor the credit and foreign currency exchange markets, 46 Table of Contents developments in health care reform and legislation as well as the practices of our suppliers, manufacturers, corporate partners and customers, and will adjust our business processes as needed to mitigate these risks to our business. The successes we experienced in 2008 have helped us maintain and build a financially sound business model that we believe will allow us to continue to expand our commercial, collaborative and R&D activities, and maintain the infrastructure to ensure quality and compliance in all areas of our business. As we continue to grow our business and achieve greater operational leverage, we remain focused on profitable revenue growth and prudent expense management that we believe will enable solid execution of our operating objectives for 2009. Critical Accounting Policies, Estimates and Judgments The discussion and analysis of our financial condition and results of operations is based on our Consolidated Financial Statements, which have been prepared in accordance with U.S. generally accepted accounting principles. The preparation of these financial statements requires us to make estimates and judgments that affect the reported amounts of assets, liabilities, revenues and expenses and related disclosures. On an ongoing basis, we evaluate our estimates, including those related to revenue recognition, allowance for doubtful accounts, prepaid royalties, clinical trial accruals, our tax provision and stock-based compensation. We base our estimates on historical experience and on various other market specific assumptions that we believe to be reasonable under the circumstances, the results of which form the basis for making judgments about the carrying values of assets and liabilities that are not readily apparent from other sources. Actual results, however, may differ significantly from these estimates. We believe the following critical accounting policies reflect the more significant judgments and estimates used in the preparation of our Consolidated Financial Statements. Revenue Recognition Product Sales We recognize revenues from product sales when there is persuasive evidence that an arrangement exists, delivery to the customer has occurred, the price is fixed or determinable and collectibility is reasonably assured. We record estimated reductions to revenues for government rebates such as Medicaid reimbursements, customer incentives such as cash discounts for prompt payment, distributor fees and expected returns of expired products. These estimates are deducted from gross product sales at the time such revenues are recognized. Of these reductions from gross product sales, government rebates significantly impact our reported net product sales and are based upon certain estimates that require complex and significant judgment by management. Government Rebates We estimate amounts payable by us to government managed Medicaid programs as well as to certain other qualifying federal, state and foreign government programs for the reimbursement of portions of the retail price of prescriptions filled that are covered by these programs. Government rebates that are invoiced directly to us are recorded in other accrued liabilities on our Consolidated Balance Sheets. For qualified programs that can purchase our products through wholesalers at a lower contractual government price, the wholesalers charge back to us the difference between their acquisition cost and the lower price, which we record as allowances against accounts receivable. Although we may pay rebates in countries outside of the United States, to date, payments made to foreign governments have not represented a significant portion of our total government rebates. For government programs in the United States, we estimate these sales allowances based on contractual terms, historical utilization rates, new information regarding changes in these programs regulations and guidelines that would impact the amount of the actual rebates, our expectations regarding future utilization rates for these programs and, for U.S. product sales, channel inventory data obtained from our major U.S. wholesalers in accordance with our inventory management agreements. During 2008, 2007 and 2006, U.S government rebates 47 Table of Contents of $625.0 million, $423.3 million and $232.5 million, respectively, representing 10%, 10% and 8% of total gross product sales, respectively, were deducted from gross product sales. Based on the current information available to us, actual government rebates claimed for these periods have varied by less than 3% from our estimates recorded in those periods. As of December 31, 2008 and 2007, we had accrued U.S. government rebates of $173.4 million and $114.1 million, respectively, in other accrued liabilities and an allowance of $32.8 million and $25.3 million, respectively, recorded against accounts receivable. The following table summarizes the aggregate activity in our U.S. government rebates allowance and accrued liabilities accounts: Balance at Beginning of Year Charged to Expense Deducted from Accruals Balance at End of Year Year ended December 31, 2008: Government rebates allowances and accrued liabilities Activity related to 2008 sales $ $ 627,935 $ 424,298 $ 203,637 Activity related to sales prior to 2008 139,370 (2,965 ) 133,769 2,636 Total $ 139,370 $ 624,970 $ 558,067 $ 206,273 Year ended December 31, 2007: Government rebates allowances and accrued liabilities Activity related to 2007 sales $ $ 426,084 $ 298,189 $ 127,895 Activity related to sales prior to 2007 75,663 (2,753 ) 61,435 11,475 Total $ 75,663 $ 423,331 $ 359,624 $ 139,370 Allowance for Doubtful Accounts We also maintain an allowance for doubtful accounts for estimated losses resulting from the inability of our customers to make required payments. This allowance is based on our analysis of several factors including, but not limited to, contractual payment terms, historical payment patterns of our customers and individual customer circumstances, an analysis of days sales outstanding by customer and geographic region and a review of the local economic environment and its potential impact on government funding and reimbursement practices. If the financial condition of our customers or the economic environment in which they operate were to deteriorate, resulting in an inability to make payments, additional allowances may be required. Our allowance for doubtful accounts balance as a percentage of total accounts receivable did not materially change from December 31, 2007 to December 31, 2008. We believe that the allowance for doubtful accounts is adequate to cover anticipated losses under current conditions; however, significant deterioration in any of the above factors, especially with respect to the government funding and reimbursement practices in the European market could materially change these expectations and may result in an increase to our allowance for doubtful accounts. Prepaid Royalties We capitalize royalties that we have prepaid at cost, specifically those related to the emtricitabine royalties we paid to Emory University (Emory) for the HIV indication, based on the present value of the future royalty obligation that we would expect to pay to Emory assuming certain expected future levels of our product sales incorporating emtricitabine. The present value of our future royalty obligation was derived using our weighted-average cost of capital. We review quarterly the expected future sales levels of our products and any indicators that might require a write-down in the net recoverable value of our asset or a change in the estimated life of the prepaid royalty. Some potential indicators of impairment include the launch of a significant product by a competitor, significant deviations in recognized product sales compared to forecast and product safety issues and recalls. 48 Table of Contents We amortize our prepaid royalties based on an effective royalty rate that we derive from forecasted HIV product sales incorporating emtricitabine. Our product sales forecasts are prepared annually and determined using our best estimates of future activity upon considering such factors as historical and expected future patient usage or uptake of our products, the introduction of complimentary or combination therapies or products and future product launch plans. If a previously unanticipated and significant change occurs to our sales forecasts, including the introduction of a competing product by us or one of our competitors in the same HIV market as emtricitabine, we will prospectively update the royalty rate used to amortize our prepaid royalties which may increase future royalty expense. As of December 31, 2008, we had a prepaid royalty asset relating to the emtricitabine royalties we paid to Emory of $275.0 million. Amortization expense relating to this prepaid royalty asset was $31.8 million, $14.3 million and $15.1 million, for the years ended December 31, 2008, 2007 and 2006, respectively. Clinical Trial Accruals We record accruals for estimated clinical study costs. Most of our clinical studies are performed by third party contract research organizations (CROs). These costs are a significant component of R&D expenses. During 2008, 2007 and 2006, we incurred CRO costs of $111.8 million, $65.6 million and $30.2 million, respectively. We accrue costs for clinical studies performed by CROs on a straight-line basis over the service periods specified in the contracts and adjust our estimates, if required, based upon our ongoing review of the level of effort and costs actually incurred by the CROs. We validate our accruals quarterly with our vendors and perform detailed reviews of the activities related to our significant contracts. Based upon the results of these validation processes, we assess the appropriateness of our accruals and make any adjustments we deem necessary to ensure that our expenses reflect the actual effort incurred by the CROs. Generally, a significant portion of the total clinical trial costs is associated with start up activities for the trial and patient enrollment. We extensively outsource our clinical trial activities and usually perform only a small portion of the start-up activities in-house. As a result, CROs typically perform most of the total start-up activities for our trials, including document preparation, site identification, screening and preparation, pre-study visits, training and program management. Start-up costs usually occur within a few months after the contract has been executed and are milestone or event driven in nature. The remaining clinical activities and related costs, such as patient monitoring and administration, generally occur ratably throughout the life of the individual contract or study. Most contracts are negotiated as fixed per unit prices and can vary in length between three months for a single dose Phase 1 clinical study and up to two years or more for a more complex Phase 3 clinical study. The average length of contracts in 2008, 2007 and 2006 has been at the upper end of this range in order to provide long-term safety and efficacy data to support the commercial launches of Truvada, Atripla, Viread, Hepsera, Emtriva and Letairis. All of our material CRO contracts are terminable by us upon written notice and we are generally only liable for actual effort expended by the CRO and certain non-cancelable expenses incurred at any point of termination. Amounts paid in advance relating to uncompleted services will be refunded to us if a contract is terminated. Some contracts may include additional termination payments that become due and payable if we terminate the contract. Such additional termination payments are only recorded if it becomes probable that a contract will be terminated. Through December 31, 2008, differences between actual and estimated activity levels for any particular study have not been material. However, if management does not receive complete and accurate information from our vendors or underestimates activity levels associated with a study at a given point in time, we may have to record additional and potentially significant R&D expenses in future periods. Tax Provision We estimate our income tax provision, including deferred tax assets and liabilities, based on significant management judgment. We evaluate the realization of all or a portion of our deferred tax assets on a quarterly basis. We record a valuation allowance to reduce our deferred tax assets to the amounts that are more likely than not to be realized. We consider future taxable income, ongoing tax planning strategies and our historical financial performance in assessing the need for a valuation allowance. 49 Table of Contents If we expect to realize deferred tax assets for which we have previously recorded a valuation allowance, we will reduce the valuation allowance in the period in which such determination is first made. Such an adjustment was made in 2008 and 2007 when we determined that it was more likely than not that certain of our deferred tax assets would be realized, and therefore, we released the related valuation allowance. This resulted in a credit to goodwill of approximately $8.0 million for 2008 and an income tax benefit of approximately $15.5 million and $1.5 million for 2008 and 2007, respectively. Our future effective income tax rate may be affected by such factors as changes in tax laws, regulations or rates, changing interpretation of existing laws or regulations, the impact of accounting for stock-based compensation, changes in our international organization and changes in overall levels of income before tax. In June 2006, the Financial Accounting Standards Board (FASB) issued FASB Interpretation No. 48, Accounting for Uncertainty in Income Taxes (FIN 48), an interpretation of Statement of Financial Accounting Standards (SFAS) No. 109, Accounting for Income Taxes (SFAS 109). FIN 48 clarifies the accounting for uncertainty in income taxes recognized in an enterprise financial statements in accordance with SFAS 109 by prescribing a minimum recognition threshold and measurement attribute for the financial statement recognition and measurement of a tax position taken or expected to be taken in a tax return. FIN 48 also provides guidance on derecognition, classification, interest and penalties, accounting in interim periods, disclosure and transition. FIN 48 is effective for fiscal years beginning after December 15, 2006. On January 1, 2007, we adopted FIN 48 and increased our liability for unrecognized tax benefits by $14.1 million with a corresponding charge to the opening balance of accumulated deficit, as permitted under FIN 48. In addition, we reclassified $68.4 million of unrecognized tax benefits from short-term income taxes payable and noncurrent deferred tax assets to long-term income taxes payable. As of the date of adoption, we had total federal, state and foreign unrecognized tax benefits of $86.2 million recorded primarily in long-term income taxes payable on our Consolidated Balance Sheet, including accrued liabilities related to interest of $4.0 million. Of the total unrecognized tax benefits, $78.0 million, if recognized, would have reduced our effective tax rate in the period of recognition. As permitted under the provisions of FIN 48, we have continued to classify interest and penalties related to unrecognized tax benefits as part of our income tax provision in our Consolidated Statements of Operations. At December 31, 2008 and 2007, we had total federal, state and foreign unrecognized tax benefits of $119.3 million and $111.7 million, respectively, including interest of $10.1 million and $8.3 million, respectively. Of the total unrecognized tax benefits at December 31, 2008 and 2007, $111.1 million and $103.5 million, respectively, if recognized, would reduce our effective tax rate in the period of recognition. During 2008, we reached agreement with the Internal Revenue Service (IRS) on several issues related to the examinations of our federal income tax returns for 2003 and 2004. As a result, we reduced our unrecognized tax benefits by $30.0 million. As of December 31, 2008, we believe it is reasonably possible that our unrecognized tax benefits will decrease by approximately $56.0 million in the next 12 months as we expect to have clarification from the IRS around certain of our uncertain tax positions. With respect to the remaining unrecognized tax benefits, we are currently unable to make a reasonable estimate as to the period of cash settlement, if any, with the respective taxing authorities. We file federal, state and foreign income tax returns in many jurisdictions in the United States and abroad. For U.S. federal and California income tax purposes, the statute of limitations remains open for all years from inception due to our utilization of net operating losses related to prior years. Our income tax returns are audited by federal, state and foreign tax authorities. We are currently under examination by the IRS for the 2003 and 2004 tax years and by various state and foreign jurisdictions. There are 50 Table of Contents differing interpretations of tax laws and regulations, and as a result, significant disputes may arise with these tax authorities involving issues of the timing and amount of deductions and allocations of income among various tax jurisdictions. We periodically evaluate our exposures associated with our tax filing positions. We record liabilities related to uncertain tax positions based upon FIN 48. We do not believe any of the currently pending items will have a material adverse effect on our Consolidated Financial Statements, although an adverse resolution of several or more of these items in any period could have a material impact on the results of operations for that period. Prior to the adoption of FIN 48, we recorded liabilities related to uncertain tax positions based upon SFAS No. 5, Accounting for Contingencies . Stock-based Compensation In December 2004, the FASB issued SFAS No. 123 (revised 2004), Share-Based Payment (SFAS 123R), which requires that all share-based payments to employees and directors, including grants of stock options, be recognized in the statement of operations based on their fair values. SFAS 123R supersedes Accounting Principles Board Opinion No. 25, Accounting for Stock Issued to Employees (APB 25) and amends SFAS No. 95, Statement of Cash Flows . On January 1, 2006, we adopted SFAS 123R using the modified prospective method of adoption as permitted under SFAS 123R, which requires that compensation expense be recorded for all nonvested stock options and other stock-based awards as of the beginning of the first quarter of adoption. In connection with our adoption of SFAS 123R, we refined our valuation assumptions and the methodologies used to derive those assumptions; however, we elected to continue using the Black-Scholes option valuation model. The fair value of stock options granted prior to the adoption of SFAS 123R was calculated using the multiple option approach while the fair value of stock options granted beginning January 1, 2006 was calculated using the single option approach. Concurrent with our adoption of SFAS 123R, we determined that a blend of historical volatility along with implied volatility for traded options on our stock would be a better measure of market conditions and expected volatility. Previously, we used historical stock price volatility as it was the most reliable source of volatility data. We estimate the weighted-average expected term of our stock options based on historical cancellation and exercise data related to our stock options as well as the contractual term and vesting terms of the awards. We record stock-based compensation expense using a graded vesting expense attribution approach for nonvested stock options granted prior to the adoption of SFAS 123R consistent with the expense attribution approach used for our historical SFAS 123 disclosures and use a straight-line expense attribution approach for stock options granted after the adoption of SFAS 123R. We currently believe that the straight-line expense attribution approach better reflects the level of service to be provided by our employees over the vesting period of our awards. Stock-based compensation expense related to stock options is recognized net of estimated forfeitures. We estimate forfeitures based on our historical experience. As a result of the adoption of SFAS 123R, we will only recognize a tax benefit from stock-based compensation in additional paid-in-capital (APIC) if an incremental tax benefit is realized after all other tax attributes currently available to us have been utilized. In addition, we have elected to account for the indirect benefits of stock-based compensation on the research tax credit and the extraterritorial income deduction through the Consolidated Statements of Operations rather than through APIC. During the years ended December 31, 2008, 2007 and 2006, we recognized stock-based compensation expense of $153.4 million, $184.6 million and $133.8 million, respectively, in operating expenses, and we capitalized $9.9 million, $9.8 million and $10.2 million, respectively, to inventory. As of December 31, 2008, we had unrecognized stock-based compensation of $405.3 million related to nonvested stock options, which we expect to expense over an estimated weighted-average period of 2.9 years. Our management has discussed the development, selection and disclosure of these critical accounting policies with the Audit Committee of our Board of Directors, and the Audit Committee has reviewed the disclosure presented above relating to these critical accounting policies. 51 Table of Contents Results of Operations Total Revenues We had total revenues of $5.34 billion in 2008, $4.23 billion in 2007 and $3.03 billion in 2006. Included in total revenues were product sales, royalty revenues and contract and other revenues. Product Sales Product sales for the last three years consisted of the following (in thousands): 2008 Change 2007 Change 2006 Antiviral products: Truvada $ 2,106,687 33 % $ 1,589,229 33 % $ 1,194,292 Atripla 1,572,455 74 % 903,381 339 % 205,729 Viread 621,187 1 % 613,169 (11 )% 689,356 Hepsera 341,023 13 % 302,722 31 % 230,531 Emtriva 31,080 (1 )% 31,493 (13 )% 36,393 Total antiviral products 4,672,432 36 % 3,439,994 46 % 2,356,301 AmBisome 289,651 10 % 262,571 18 % 223,031 Letairis 112,855 437 % 21,020 Other 9,858 4 % 9,524 7 % 8,865 Total product sales $ 5,084,796 36 % $ 3,733,109 44 % $ 2,588,197 Total product sales increased by 36% in 2008 compared to 2007, due primarily to an overall increase in our antiviral product sales including the strong growth of Atripla sales as well as the continued growth of Truvada sales. Foreign currency denominated product sales experienced a net benefit from the depreciation of the U.S. dollar of approximately $148.2 million for 2008 compared to 2007. Total product sales increased by 44% in 2007 compared to 2006, due primarily to an increase in our total product sales volume of $1.04 billion and a favorable foreign currency exchange impact of $97.9 million. A significant percentage of our product sales continued to be denominated in foreign currencies. We used foreign currency forward and option contracts to hedge a percentage of our forecasted international sales, primarily those denominated in Euro. This reduced, but did not eliminate, fluctuations in sales due to changes in foreign currency exchange rates, as seen by the net benefit mentioned above. Antiviral Products Antiviral product sales in 2008 increased by 36% compared to 2007 and by 46% in 2007 compared to 2006, driven primarily by sales volume growth of Atripla and Truvada, as well as a favorable foreign currency exchange impact. Truvada Truvada sales increased by 33% in 2008 compared to 2007 driven primarily by sales volume growth in the United States and Europe, and a favorable foreign currency exchange impact. Truvada sales increased by 33% in 2007 compared to 2006 driven primarily by strong sales volume growth in Europe as well as a favorable foreign currency exchange environment in 2007. Truvada sales accounted for 45%, 46% and 51% of our total antiviral product sales for 2008, 2007 and 2006, respectively. Atripla Atripla sales increased by 74% in 2008 compared to 2007, driven primarily by the continued uptake of Atripla in the United States, as well as launches of the product in most European countries. Atripla sales increased 339% in 2007 compared to 2006, due primarily to the first full year of Atripla sales in 52 Table of Contents 2007 as Atripla was launched in the United States in July 2006 as well as the continued strong uptake of Atripla in the United States. We consolidate 100% of Atripla product sales because we are the primary beneficiary of our joint venture with Bristol Myers-Squibb Company (BMS) in the United States. Outside of the United States, we also recognize 100% of Atripla product sales. The efavirenz portion of our Atripla sales was approximately $576.0 million, $334.3 million and $76.0 million in 2008, 2007 and 2006, respectively. Atripla sales accounted for 34%, 26% and 9% of our total antiviral product sales for 2008, 2007 and 2006, respectively. Sales of Atripla in the European Union were not significant in 2007 as Atripla was approved for sale in the European Union in December 2007. Other Antiviral Products Other antiviral product sales, which include product sales of Viread, Hepsera and Emtriva, increased by 5% in 2008 compared to 2007 driven primarily by a 13% increase in Hepsera sales which benefited from a favorable foreign currency impact as well as sales volume growth in certain European countries. Other antiviral product sales decreased by 1% in 2007 compared to 2006 driven primarily by an 11% and 13% decrease in the sales of Viread and Emtriva, respectively, due to the impact of patients switching from Viread and Emtriva containing regimens to regimens containing Truvada and/or Atripla in countries where these combination products were available, partially offset by a 31% increase in Hepsera sales due primarily to sales volume growth across all major geographical regions and a favorable foreign currency exchange environment. AmBisome Sales of AmBisome increased 10% in 2008 compared to 2007, due primarily to a favorable foreign currency exchange impact and sales volume growth in certain European markets. Sales of AmBisome increased 18% in 2007 compared to 2006, due primarily to sales volume growth in Europe as well as a favorable foreign currency exchange impact. AmBisome product sales in the United States relate solely to our sales of AmBisome to Astellas Pharma Inc. which are recorded at our manufacturing cost. Letairis Sales of Letairis for the treatment of PAH increased 437% in 2008 compared to 2007, driven primarily by sales volume growth in the United States as Letairis was launched in June 2007. We expect total product sales to continue to grow in 2009 as we continue to expand our sales and marketing efforts. Royalty Revenues The following table summarizes the period over period changes in our royalty revenues (in thousands): 2008 Change 2007 Change 2006 Royalty revenues $ 218,180 (53 )% $ 468,155 12 % $ 416,526 Our most significant source of royalty revenues for 2008, 2007 and 2006 was from sales of Tamiflu by F. Hoffmann-La Roche Ltd (together with Hoffmann-La Roche Inc., Roche). Royalty revenues for 2008 were $218.2 million, a decrease of 53% compared to 2007, driven primarily by the recognition of Tamiflu royalties from Roche of $155.5 million in 2008 compared to Tamiflu royalties from Roche of $414.5 million in 2007. The lower Tamiflu royalties for 2008 was due primarily to decreased Roche sales related to pandemic planning initiatives worldwide. Royalty revenues for 2007 were $468.2 million, an increase of 12% compared to 2006, driven primarily by the recognition of higher Tamiflu royalties from Roche in 2007, compared to $364.6 million recorded in 2006. The higher Tamiflu royalties for 2007 were due to the 53 Table of Contents higher Tamiflu sales recorded by Roche, including sales related to pandemic planning initiatives worldwide during 2007. We recognize royalties on Tamiflu sales by Roche in the quarter following the quarter in which Tamiflu is sold. Cost of Goods Sold and Product Gross Margin The following table summarizes the period over period changes in our product sales (in thousands), cost of goods sold (in thousands) and product gross margin: 2008 Change 2007 Change 2006 Total product sales $ 5,084,796 36% $ 3,733,109 44% $ 2,588,197 Cost of goods sold $ 1,127,246 47% $ 768,771 77% $ 433,320 Product gross margin 78% 79% 83% Our product gross margin for 2008 was 78% compared to 79% for 2007 and 83% for 2006. The decreases in product gross margin are due primarily to the growing proportion of Atripla sales, which include the efavirenz portion at zero product gross margin and the impact of changes in the product and geographic mix of our product sales. A higher mix of Atripla product sales decreases our overall product gross margin. Although we record 100% of Atripla product sales, we only benefit from the product gross margin on the Truvada portion of Atripla sales. The efavirenz portion of Atripla sales carries a zero product gross profit and gross margin since we purchase efavirenz from BMS at BMS net selling price of efavirenz. We expect our product gross margin in 2009 to be lower compared to 2008, due primarily to higher expected Atripla sales. Research and Development Expenses The following table summarizes the period over period changes in the major components of our R&D expenses (in thousands): 2008 Change 2007 Change 2006 Research $ 159,148 21 % $ 131,019 54 % $ 85,202 Clinical development 449,598 25 % 361,091 52 % 238,270 Pharmaceutical development 113,022 14 % 98,916 64 % 60,389 Total research and development $ 721,768 22 % $ 591,026 54 % $ 383,861 R&D expenses consist primarily of personnel costs, including salaries, benefits and stock-based compensation, clinical studies performed by CROs, materials and supplies, license fees and overhead allocations consisting of various support and facilities related costs. Our R&D activities are separated into three main categories: research, clinical development and pharmaceutical development. Research costs typically consist of preclinical and toxicology costs. Clinical development costs include costs for Phase 1, 2, 3 and 4 clinical trials. Pharmaceutical development expenses consist of costs for product formulation and chemical analysis. R&D expenses in 2008 increased by $130.7 million or 22%, compared to 2007, due primarily to increased clinical study expenses of $75.2 million primarily in the antiviral and cardiovascular areas, as well as increased compensation and benefit expenses of $50.7 million due primarily to higher headcount. R&D expenses in 2007 increased by $207.2 million or 54%, compared to 2006, due primarily to increased compensation and benefit expenses of $65.2 million due largely to higher headcount, increased clinical study 54 Table of Contents expenses of $58.6 million and increased contract service expenses of $19.6 million relating to clinical, product development and research activities in our cardiovascular programs. In addition, we paid a $20.0 million up-front license fee to LG Life Sciences, Ltd. (LGLS) and a $13.5 million license related fee to PARI GmbH (PARI) in 2007, both of which we expensed as there were no future alternative uses for these technologies. In general, significant collaboration payments, like those made to LGLS and PARI, will cause our R&D expenses to fluctuate period over period. In 2009, we expect R&D expenses to increase over 2008 levels due to increased spending on our internal and collaborative R&D efforts as we anticipate progressing our product candidates into more advanced clinical studies as well as adding more clinical development programs to our pipeline. Selling, General and Administrative Expenses The following table summarizes the period over period changes in our SG&A expenses over the last three years (in thousands): 2008 Change 2007 Change 2006 Selling, general and administrative $ 797,344 13 % $ 705,741 23 % $ 573,660 SG&A expenses for 2008 increased by $91.6 million or 13%, compared to 2007, due primarily to increased compensation and benefit expenses of $41.6 million due largely to higher headcount, increased marketing and promotional expenses of $19.9 million to support our expanded commercial operations, increased consulting and support services expenses of $13.0 million related to the growth in our business, costs of $12.4 million associated with certain employee termination related disputes in our international operations as well as increased infrastructure and technology expenses of $11.7 million. The increase in 2008 compared to 2007 was partially offset by a decrease in stock-based compensation expense of $24.8 million due primarily to the higher expense associated with unvested stock options that we had assumed from Myogen, including accelerated stock-based compensation expenses related to certain Myogen employee terminations during 2007. SG&A expenses for 2007 increased by $132.1 million or 23%, compared to 2006. The increase was due primarily to an increase in compensation and benefits expenses of $79.6 million due largely to higher headcount, as well as an increase in marketing and promotional expenses of $20.0 million in the antiviral and cardiovascular areas, including those related to our launch of Letairis for the treatment of PAH. In 2009, we expect SG&A expenses to remain essentially consistent with 2008 SG&A expenses. We believe that our 2008 organizational and geographic expansion activities will provide the appropriate infrastructure to support our business in 2009. Purchased In-process Research and Development Expenses In connection with our acquisitions of Myogen Inc. (Myogen) and Corus Pharma, Inc. (Corus) in 2006, we recorded purchased IPR&D expenses of $2.06 billion and $335.6 million, respectively, during the year ended December 31, 2006. 55 Table of Contents The purchased IPR&D expense for Myogen represented the estimated fair value of Myogen incomplete R&D programs that had not yet reached technological feasibility and had no alternative future uses as of the acquisition date and, therefore, was expensed upon acquisition. A summary of these programs at the acquisition date, updated for subsequent changes in status of development, is as follows: Program Description Status of Development Estimated Acquisition Date Fair Value (in millions) Ambrisentan An orally active, non-sulfonamide, propanoic acid-class, endothelin receptor antagonist (ERA) for the treatment of PAH. Phase 3 clinical trials were completed prior to the acquisition date. We filed an NDA with the FDA in December 2006 and, in June 2007, the FDA approved Letairis for the treatment of PAH in the United States. Additionally, in March 2007, the European Medicines Agency (EMEA) validated the marketing authorization application for ambrisentan for the treatment of PAH, filed by our collaboration partner, GSK. In April 2008, the European Commission granted GSK marketing authorization for ambrisentan for the treatment of PAH, which is marketed under the name Volibris by GSK. $ 1,413.7 Darusentan An orally active ETA-selective ERA for the treatment of resistant hypertension. In Phase 3 clinical development as of the acquisition date and the date of this filing. $ 644.5 The estimated fair value of the purchased IPR&D was determined using the income approach, which discounts expected future cash flows to present value. We estimated the fair value of the purchased IPR&D using a present value discount rate of 14%, which is based on the estimated internal rate of return for Myogen operations, is comparable to the estimated weighted-average cost of capital for companies with Myogen profile, and represents the rate that market participants would use to value the purchased IPR&D. We compensated for the differing phases of development of ambrisentan and darusentan by probability-adjusting our estimation of the expected future cash flows associated with each program. We then determined at that time the present value of the expected future cash flows using the discount rate of 14%. The projected cash flows from the ambrisentan and darusentan programs were based on key assumptions such as estimates of revenues and operating profits related to the programs considering their stages of development; the time and resources needed to complete the development and approval of the related product candidates; the life of the potential commercialized products and associated risks, including the inherent difficulties and uncertainties in developing a drug compound such as obtaining FDA and other regulatory approvals; and risks related to the viability of and potential alternative treatments in any future target markets. For the purpose of estimating the fair value of the ambrisentan program, we estimated that the program was approximately 78% complete as of the acquisition date, based on estimated time and cost to complete, as Phase 3 clinical trials had been completed. As of the acquisition date, we estimated that we would incur future R&D costs of approximately $35 million to $45 million from the date of acquisition through and including the year when commercialization was expected to occur. Material net cash inflows were estimated to begin in 2009 for ambrisentan, assuming the necessary regulatory approvals would be received and the product would be successfully commercialized by that date. 56 Table of Contents For the purpose of estimating the fair value of the darusentan program, we estimated that the program was approximately 35% complete as of the acquisition date, based on estimated time and cost to complete, and remaining efforts would include the completion of Phase 3 clinical development as well as preparing for and filing an NDA with the FDA. As of the acquisition date, we estimated that we would incur future R&D costs of approximately $130 million to $140 million from the date of acquisition through and including the year when commercialization was expected to occur. Material net cash inflows were estimated to begin in 2012 for darusentan, assuming the necessary regulatory approvals would be received and the product would be successfully commercialized by that date. The remaining efforts for completing the darusentan IPR&D program consist primarily of clinical trials, the cost, length and success of which are extremely difficult to predict, and obtaining necessary regulatory approvals. Numerous risks and uncertainties exist that could prevent completion of development, including the possibility of unfavorable results of our clinical trials and the risk of failing to obtain FDA and other regulatory body approvals. Feedback from regulatory authorities or results from clinical trials might require modifications to or delays in later stage clinical trials or additional trials to be performed. We cannot be certain that darusentan for the treatment of resistant hypertension will be approved in the United States or in countries outside of the United States or whether marketing approvals will have significant limitations on its use. Future discussions with regulatory agencies will determine the amount of data needed and timelines for review, which may differ materially from current projections. Darusentan may never be successfully commercialized. As a result, we may make a strategic decision to discontinue development of darusentan if, for example, we believe commercialization will be difficult relative to other opportunities in our pipeline. If this program cannot be completed on a timely basis or at all, then our prospects for future revenue growth may be adversely impacted. No assurance can be given that the underlying assumptions used to forecast the above cash flows or the timely and successful completion of this project will materialize as estimated. For these reasons, among others, actual results may vary significantly from estimated results. The purchased IPR&D expense for Corus represented the estimated fair value of Corus incomplete aztreonam for inhalation solution for CF R&D program that had not yet reached technological feasibility and had no alternative future use as of the acquisition date and, therefore, was expensed upon acquisition. A description of this program at the acquisition date, updated for subsequent changes in status of development, is as follows: Program Description Status of Development Estimated Acquisition Date Fair Value (in millions) Aztreonam for inhalation solution for the treatment of CF Aztreonam formulation for inhalation to be used against Gram-negative bacteria that cause lung infections in patients with CF. In Phase 3 clinical trials as of the acquisition date. We filed an NDA with the FDA in November 2007. In September 2008, we received a complete response letter from the FDA informing us that the FDA will not approve our NDA for aztreonam for inhalation solution for the treatment of CF in its current form and requesting we conduct an additional Phase 3 clinical study. In November 2008, we filed a request for a formal dispute resolution with the FDA. In February 2009, in response to our appeal, the FDA notified us that it is reiterating its position that we will need to conduct another clinical study of aztreonam for inhalation solution before we can resubmit our NDA. We have also submitted a marketing authorization application in the European Union and received notice of acceptance and priority review by Health Canada for approval in Canada. We are still awaiting responses from the respective regulatory bodies. $ 335.6 57 Table of Contents The estimated fair value of the purchased IPR&D was determined using the income approach, which discounts expected future cash flows to present value. We estimated the fair value of the purchased IPR&D using a present value discount rate of 16%, which is based on the estimated internal rate of return for Corus operations, is comparable to the estimated weighted-average cost of capital for companies with Corus profile, and represents the rate that market participants would use to value the purchased IPR&D. The projected cash flows from the aztreonam for inhalation solution program were based on key assumptions such as estimates of revenues and operating profits related to the program considering its stage of development; the time and resources needed to complete the development and approval of the related product candidate; the life of the potential commercialized product and associated risks, including the inherent difficulties and uncertainties in developing a drug compound such as obtaining FDA and other regulatory approvals; and risks related to the viability of and potential alternative treatments in any future target markets. Corus two other early stage candidates were not included in the valuation of purchased IPR&D because they were early stage projects that did not have identifiable revenues and expenses associated with them. For the purpose of estimating the fair value of the aztreonam for inhalation solution program, we estimated that the program was approximately 71% complete as of the acquisition date, based on estimated time and cost to complete, and remaining efforts would include the completion of Phase 3 clinical development as well as preparing for and filing an NDA with the FDA. As of the acquisition date, we estimated that we would incur future R&D costs of approximately $30 million to $35 million from the date of acquisition through and including the year when commercialization was expected to occur. Material net cash inflows were estimated to begin in 2009 for the aztreonam for inhalation solution program, assuming the necessary regulatory approvals would be received and the product would be successfully commercialized by that date. The remaining efforts for completing Corus IPR&D program consist primarily of clinical trials, the cost, length and success of which are extremely difficult to predict. Numerous risks and uncertainties exist that could prevent completion of development, including the possibility of unfavorable results of our clinical trial and the risk of failing to obtain FDA and other regulatory body approvals. We cannot be certain that aztreonam for inhalation solution for the treatment of CF will be approved in the United States or in countries outside of the United States or whether marketing approvals will have significant limitations on its use. Aztreonam for inhalation solution for the treatment of CF may never be successfully commercialized. As a result, we may make a strategic decision to discontinue development of aztreonam for inhalation solution for the treatment of CF if, for example, we believe commercialization will be difficult relative to other opportunities in our pipeline. If this program cannot be completed on a timely basis or at all, then our prospects for future revenue growth may be adversely impacted. No assurance can be given that the underlying assumptions used to forecast the above cash flows or the timely and successful completion of the project will materialize as estimated. For these reasons, among others, actual results may vary significantly from estimated results. In connection with our acquisition of the cicletanine assets from Navitas Assets, LLC, we recorded purchased IPR&D expense of $10.9 million during 2008. As we do not consider the acquisition to be a material transaction, we have not made further disclosures regarding the related purchased IPR&D. Interest and Other Income, Net We recorded interest and other income, net, of $59.4 million, $109.8 million and $134.6 million in 2008, 2007 and 2006, respectively. The decrease in 2008 compared to 2007 was due primarily to increased costs related to our hedging activities of $32.3 million, net foreign currency losses of $15.7 million and decreased interest income of $7.5 million due primarily to lower interest rates, partially offset by the write-downs of certain securities recorded in 2007 and which are mentioned below. The decrease in 2007 compared to 2006 was primarily attributable to the lower average cash and investment balances over 2006, as well as the write-down of $7.0 million and $1.8 million relating to the other-than-temporary impairment of our investments in Achillion Pharmaceuticals, Inc. and the asset-backed commercial paper of a structured investment vehicle, respectively. 58 Table of Contents Provision for Income Taxes Our provision for income taxes was $723.3 million, $655.0 million and $551.8 million in 2008, 2007 and 2006, respectively. The 2008 effective tax rate of 26.5% differs from the U.S. federal statutory rate of 35% due primarily to tax credits, the resolution of certain tax positions with taxing authorities and certain operating earnings from non-U.S. subsidiaries that are considered indefinitely invested outside the United States, offset by state taxes. The 2007 effective tax rate of 28.9% differs from the U.S. federal statutory rate of 35% due primarily to tax credits and certain operating earnings from non-U.S. subsidiaries that are considered indefinitely invested outside the United States, offset by state taxes. Included in our operating income in 2006 were pre-tax charges of $335.6 million and $2.06 billion for the purchased IPR&D expenses associated with our Corus and Myogen acquisitions, respectively. We did not record any income tax benefit related to the purchased IPR&D expenses as such amounts are non-deductible. The 2006 effective tax rate of (86.5)% differs from the U.S. federal statutory rate of 35% due primarily to tax credits and certain operating earnings from non-U.S. subsidiaries that are considered indefinitely invested outside the United States, offset by our federal tax non-deductible purchased IPR&D expenses and state taxes. In June 2006, the FASB issued FIN 48, which clarifies the accounting for uncertainty in income taxes recognized in an enterprise financial statements in accordance with SFAS 109 by prescribing a minimum recognition threshold and measurement attribute for the financial statement recognition and measurement of a tax position taken or expected to be taken in a tax return. FIN 48 also provides guidance on derecognition, classification, interest and penalties, accounting in interim periods, disclosure and transition. FIN 48 is effective for fiscal years beginning after December 15, 2006. On January 1, 2007, we adopted FIN 48 and increased our liability for unrecognized tax benefits by $14.1 million with a corresponding charge to the opening balance of accumulated deficit, as permitted under FIN 48. In addition, we reclassified $68.4 million of unrecognized tax benefits from short-term income taxes payable and noncurrent deferred tax assets to long-term income taxes payable. As of the date of adoption, we had total federal, state and foreign unrecognized tax benefits of $86.2 million recorded primarily in long-term income taxes payable on our Consolidated Balance Sheet, including accrued liabilities related to interest of $4.0 million. Of the total unrecognized tax benefits, $78.0 million, if recognized, would have reduced our effective tax rate in the period of recognition. As permitted under the provisions of FIN 48, we have continued to classify interest and penalties related to unrecognized tax benefits as part of our income tax provision in our Consolidated Statements of Operations. As of December 31, 2008 and 2007, we had total federal, state and foreign unrecognized tax benefits of $119.3 million and $111.7 million, respectively, including interest of $10.1 million and $8.3 million, respectively. Of the total unrecognized tax benefits at December 31, 2008 and 2007, $111.1 million and $103.5 million, respectively, if recognized, would reduce our effective tax rate in the period of recognition. During 2008, we reached agreement with the IRS on several issues related to the examinations of our federal income tax returns for 2003 and 2004. As a result, we reduced our unrecognized tax benefits by $30.0 million. As of December 31, 2008, we believe it is reasonably possible that our unrecognized tax benefits will decrease by approximately $56.0 million in the next 12 months as we expect to have clarification from the IRS around certain of our uncertain tax positions. With respect to the remaining unrecognized tax benefits, we are currently unable to make a reasonable estimate as to the period of cash settlement, if any, with the respective taxing authorities. 59 Table of Contents Liquidity and Capital Resources The following table summarizes our cash, cash equivalents and marketable securities, our working capital and our cash flow activities as of the end of, and for each of, the last three years (in thousands): 2008 2007 2006 As of December 31: Cash, cash equivalents and marketable securities $ 3,239,639 $ 2,722,422 $ 1,389,566 Working capital $ 3,079,289 $ 2,292,017 $ 1,664,930 Year Ended December 31: Cash provided by (used in): Operating activities $ 2,204,659 $ 1,765,398 $ 1,218,059 Investing activities $ (178,819 ) $ (1,302,467 ) $ (1,739,334 ) Financing activities $ (1,535,844 ) $ (267,299 ) $ 649,261 Cash, Cash Equivalents and Marketable Securities Cash, cash equivalents and marketable securities totaled $3.24 billion at December 31, 2008, an increase of $517.2 million or 19% from December 31, 2007. This increase was primarily attributable to: net cash provided by operations of $2.20 billion in 2008; and proceeds from issuances of common stock under our employee stock plans of $246.1 million in 2008. These increases were partially offset by our repurchases of $1.97 billion of our common stock under our stock repurchase program during 2008. Cash, cash equivalents and marketable securities totaled $2.72 billion at December 31, 2007, an increase of $1.33 billion or 96% from December 31, 2006. The increase of $1.33 billion was primarily attributable to: net cash provided by operations of $1.77 billion in 2007; and proceeds from issuances of stock under our employee stock plans of $243.4 million in 2007. These increases were partially offset by: our repurchases of $487.5 million of our common stock under our stock repurchase programs in 2007; our repayment of all remaining amounts due under our term loan of $99.0 million in 2007; and capital expenditures of $76.5 million relating to the expansion of our facilities to accommodate our growth in 2007. Working Capital Working capital at December 31, 2008 was $3.08 billion, an increase of $787.3 million from December 31, 2007. This increase was primarily attributable to: an increase of $327.9 million in inventories due primarily to the purchases of efavirenz at the estimated market value of efavirenz from BMS; an increase of $228.3 million in accounts receivable, net, driven primarily by increased product sales; and a $618.1 million increase in cash, cash equivalents and short-term marketable securities. These increases were partially offset by a $310.9 million increase in accounts payable due primarily to the purchases of efavirenz at the estimated market value of Sustiva from BMS. 60 Table of Contents Working capital at December 31, 2007 was $2.29 billion compared to $1.66 billion at December 31, 2006. Significant factors that resulted in an increase in working capital in 2007 were: $235.1 million increase in cash, cash equivalents and short-term marketable securities due primarily to cash provided by operating activities and proceeds from issuances of our common stock under our employee stock plans, which were partially offset by our repurchases of our common stock under our stock repurchase program, the repayment of our term loan and capital spending; $215.1 million increase in prepaid taxes related to intercompany profits between our U.S. parent company and our joint venture; and $185.8 million increase in accounts receivable, net, due primarily to increased sales in 2007. Cash Provided by Operating Activities Cash provided by operating activities of $2.20 billion in 2008 primarily related to net income of $2.01 billion which was adjusted for non-cash items such as $209.5 million of tax benefits from employee stock plans and $153.4 million of stock-based compensation expense. This was partially offset by $191.9 million of excess tax benefits from stock option exercises which we reclassified to cash provided by financing activities in accordance with SFAS 123R and $66.9 million of cash outflow related to changes in operating assets and liabilities. Cash provided by operating activities of $1.77 billion in 2007 was comprised primarily of $1.62 billion in net income which was adjusted for non-cash items such as $184.6 million of stock-based compensation expense, $133.1 million of deferred income taxes and $110.7 million of tax benefits related to employee stock plans and $76.3 million of excess tax benefits from stock option exercises. This was partially offset by a $236.0 million net cash outflow related to changes in operating assets and liabilities. Cash provided by operating activities of $1.22 billion in 2006 was comprised primarily of $1.19 billion in net loss which was adjusted for non-cash items such as our $2.39 billion purchased IPR&D expense, stock-based compensation expense of $133.8 million and $127.6 million of tax benefits related to employee stock plans and $95.3 million of excess tax benefits from stock option exercises. This was partially offset by a $225.1 million net cash outflow related to changes in operating assets and liabilities. Cash Used in Investing Activities Cash used in investing activities in 2008 primarily related to purchases, sales and maturities of available-for-sale securities as well as capital expenditures. Cash used in investing activities in 2007 primarily related to purchases, sales and maturities of available-for-sale securities, capital expenditures and our acquisition of Nycomed Limited. Cash used in investing activities in 2006 primarily related to purchases, sales and maturities of available-for-sale securities, our acquisitions of Myogen, Raylo Chemicals Inc. (Raylo) and Corus, as well as capital expenditures. We used $178.8 million of cash in investing activities in 2008 compared to $1.30 billion in 2007. The decrease was due primarily to more cash being used in financing activities during 2008 compared to 2007 to fund our stock repurchases. We used $1.30 billion of cash for investing activities in 2007 compared to $1.74 billion in 2006, a decrease of $436.9 million. The decrease was due primarily to our acquisitions of Myogen, Raylo and Corus for a total of $2.74 billion in 2006, as well as more cash used in the purchases, sales and maturities of marketable securities activities during 2007 compared to 2006. Capital expenditures made in 2008, 2007 and 2006 related primarily to the expansion of our manufacturing capabilities, upgrades to our facilities and spending on computer and laboratory equipment, as well as enterprise 61 Table of Contents software, to accommodate our continued business growth. In 2007, capital expenditures also included the construction of a new building at our Foster City, California headquarters. In 2006, capital expenditures also included the purchase of two buildings that we previously leased as well as construction costs of the new building at our Foster City, California headquarters. As of December 31, 2008, we had capital expenditure commitments of $292.7 million, which included the purchase of an office building and land, as well as three aircraft to be constructed for delivery in 2010 and 2013, both of which are discussed below. We expect to fulfill such commitments from funds generated from our operating cash flows. In October 2008, we signed a purchase and sale agreement to purchase an office building and approximately 30 acres of land located in Foster City, California, for an aggregate purchase price of approximately $137.5 million. We made an initial refundable deposit of $5.0 million into escrow in October, and in January 2009, the remaining balance of $132.5 million was paid into escrow upon closing the transaction. As part of closing, the purchase and sale agreement was amended to allow for a holdback in escrow of up to $15.5 million of the purchase price, to be released depending on the outcome of certain requirements mutually agreed to at closing. In August 2007, as a result of a review of the terms under our existing corporate aircraft leases and upon consideration of the various alternatives available to us upon their expiration, we entered into agreements to purchase three aircraft to be constructed for delivery in 2010 and 2013. The aggregate purchase price under the purchase agreements was $98.6 million. As of December 31, 2008, we had made deposits totaling $7.4 million which has been recorded in other noncurrent assets on our Consolidated Balance Sheet. Future deposits due under the terms of the purchase agreements are as follows: $23.0 million in 2009, $31.1 million in 2010, $4.1 million in 2011, $20.7 million in 2012 and $12.4 million in 2013. We have the option to terminate the purchase agreements, subject to a maximum payment of 7.5% of the fully equipped price of the aircraft. Cash Provided by (Used in) Financing Activities Cash used in financing activities in 2008 was $1.54 billion, driven primarily by the $1.97 billion used to repurchase our common stock under our stock repurchase program. The cash outflows were partially offset by proceeds of $246.1 million that we received from issuances of common stock under our employee stock plans, as well as $191.9 million of excess tax benefits from stock option exercises. In October 2007, our Board authorized a program for the repurchase of our common stock in an aggregate amount of up to $3.00 billion through open market and private block transactions pursuant to Rule 10b5-1 plans, privately negotiated purchases or other means. This stock repurchase program expires in December 2010. Under this stock repurchase program, in 2008 we repurchased shares in the open market and also entered into two structured accelerated share repurchase transactions with third parties which are described below. In February 2008, we entered into an accelerated share repurchase agreement with a financial institution to repurchase $500.0 million of our common stock on an accelerated basis. Under the terms of this accelerated share repurchase agreement with the financial institution, we paid $500.0 million to the financial institution to settle the initial purchase transaction and received 9,373,548 shares of our common stock at a price of $53.34 per share. In June 2008, upon maturity of the agreement and in accordance with the share delivery provisions of the agreement, we received an additional 239,612 shares of our common stock based on the average of the daily volume weighted-average prices of our common stock during a specified period less a predetermined discount per share. As a result, the final purchase price of our common stock from this accelerated share repurchase was $52.01 per share. In October 2008, we entered into an accelerated share repurchase transaction with a financial institution to repurchase $750.0 million of our common stock on an accelerated basis. Under the terms of this accelerated share repurchase agreement with the financial institution, we paid $750.0 million to the financial institution to settle the initial purchase transaction and received 14,874,519 shares of our common stock at a price of $50.42 per share. On or before April 2009, subject to extension under certain circumstances as well as the maximum and minimum share delivery provisions of the agreement, we may receive additional shares from the financial institution depending on the average of the daily volume weighted-average prices of our common stock during a 62 Table of Contents specified period less a predetermined discount per share. After making the initial payment of $750.0 million, we are not obligated to deliver any cash or shares to the financial institution except in certain limited circumstances in which case the method of delivery (cash or shares of our common stock) would be at our discretion. As of December 31, 2008, the remaining authorized amount of stock repurchases that may be made under the stock repurchase program which expires in December 2010 was $998.1 million. Cash used in financing activities in 2007 was $267.4 million, driven primarily by the $487.5 million used to repurchase our common stock under our 2006 stock repurchase program, $99.0 million used to pay off all remaining amounts due on our term loan, partially offset by the proceeds from issuance of stock under employee stock plans of $243.3 million as well as $76.3 million of excess tax benefits from stock option exercises. Cash provided by financing activities in 2006 was $649.3 million, driven primarily by the $587.6 million of net proceeds generated from the issuance of our convertible senior notes due in 2011 (2011 Notes) and the convertible senior notes due in 2013 (2013 Notes) (collectively, the Notes) and related transactions. In addition, we received proceeds from the issuance of stock under employee stock plans of $167.9 million, as well as $95.3 million of excess tax benefits from employee stock option exercises. These cash inflows were partially offset by $201.0 million in principal repayments on our term loan during 2006. Other Information In December 2007, we, along with our wholly-owned subsidiary, Gilead Biopharmaceutics Ireland Corporation (GBIC), entered into an amended and restated credit agreement, which superseded the existing revolving credit agreement, with a syndicate of banks to increase the credit facility to $1.25 billion. The amended and restated credit agreement also includes a sub-facility for swing-line loans and letters of credit. Under the terms of the amended and restated credit agreement, we may borrow initially up to an aggregate of $1.25 billion in revolving credit loans. Loans under the amended and restated credit agreement bear interest at either (i) LIBOR plus a margin ranging from 20 basis points to 32 basis points or (ii) the base rate, as defined in the amended and restated credit agreement. We can prepay any outstanding borrowings at any time in whole or in part without penalty or premium, and any outstanding interest or principal would be due and payable in December 2012. In connection with the amended and restated credit agreement, we entered into a parent guaranty agreement under which we guaranteed the obligations of GBIC under the amended and restated credit agreement. We expect to use the proceeds of any loans under the amended and restated credit agreement for working capital requirements and general corporate purposes. As of December 31, 2008, we had a $3.7 million letter of credit outstanding under the amended and restated credit agreement. We believe that our existing capital resources, supplemented by cash generated from our operations, will be adequate to satisfy our capital needs for the foreseeable future. Our future capital requirements will depend on many factors, including but not limited to the following: the commercial performance of our current and future products; the progress and scope of our R&D efforts, including preclinical studies and clinical trials; the cost, timing and outcome of regulatory reviews; the expansion of our sales and marketing capabilities; administrative expenses; the possibility of acquiring additional manufacturing capabilities or office facilities; the possibility of acquiring other companies or new products; the establishment of additional collaborative relationships with other companies; and costs associated with the defense, settlement and adverse results of litigation and government investigations. 63 Table of Contents We may in the future require additional funding, which could be in the form of proceeds from equity or debt financings. If such funding is required, we cannot assure that it will be available to us on favorable terms, if at all. Off Balance Sheet Arrangements We do not have any off balance sheet arrangements that are currently material or reasonably likely to be material to our consolidated financial position or results of operations. Contractual Obligations Our contractual obligations consist of debt obligations, operating leases as well as purchase obligations primarily in the form of capital commitments, purchase obligations for active pharmaceutical ingredients and inventory related items and clinical trials contracts. The following table summarizes our significant enforceable and legally binding obligations, future commitments and obligations related to all contracts that we are likely to continue regardless of the fact that certain of these obligations may be cancelable as of December 31, 2008 (in thousands): Payments due by Period Contractual Obligations Total Less than one year 1-3 years 3-5 years More than 5 years Convertible senior notes (1) $ 1,299,854 $ $ 649,987 $ 649,867 $ Operating lease obligations 212,938 29,946 58,308 45,082 79,602 Capital commitments (2) 292,749 203,034 56,675 33,040 Purchase obligations (3)(4) 1,085,104 635,578 279,337 170,189 Clinical trials (5) 326,938 157,385 130,935 31,072 7,546 Total $ 3,217,583 $ 1,025,943 $ 1,175,242 $ 929,250 $ 87,148 (1) At December 31, 2008, we had outstanding principal of $1.30 billion on the Notes that we issued in April 2006. (2) At December 31, 2008, we had firm capital project commitments of approximately $292.7 million primarily relating to the expansion of our facilities and infrastructure as well as purchase commitments of three corporate aircraft to be constructed for delivery in 2010 and 2013. (3) At December 31, 2008, we had firm purchase commitments related to active pharmaceutical ingredients and certain inventory related items. The amounts related to active pharmaceutical ingredients only represent minimum purchase requirements. Actual purchases are expected to significantly exceed these amounts. (4) In addition to the above, we have committed to make potential future milestone payments to third parties as part of licensing and development programs. Payments under these agreements generally become due and payable only upon achievement of certain developmental, regulatory and/or commercial milestones. Because the achievement of these milestones is neither probable nor reasonably estimable, such contingencies have not been recorded on our Consolidated Balance Sheet and have not been included in the table above. (5) At December 31, 2008, we had several clinical studies in various clinical trial phases. Our most significant clinical trial expenditures are to CROs. Although most of our contracts with CROs are cancelable, we generally have not cancelled such contracts. These amounts reflect commitments based on existing contracts and do not reflect any future modifications to, or termination of, existing contracts and anticipated or potential new contracts. We had total gross unrecognized tax benefit liabilities of $138.4 million as of December 31, 2008. We believe that it is reasonably possible that our unrecognized tax benefits will decrease by approximately $66.0 million in the next 12 months as we expect to have clarification from the IRS around certain of our uncertain tax 64 Table of Contents positions. With respect to the remaining unrecognized tax benefits, we are currently unable to make a reasonable estimate as to the period of cash settlement, if any, with the respective taxing authorities. Such amounts were included in long-term income taxes payable and long-term deferred tax assets on our Consolidated Balance Sheet, and have not been included in the table above. Recent Accounting Pronouncements In June 2008, the FASB ratified EITF Issue No. 07-5, Determining Whether an Instrument (or Embedded Feature) is Indexed to an Entity Own Stock (EITF 07-5). EITF 07-5 provides guidance on how to determine if certain instruments (or embedded features) are considered indexed to our own stock, including instruments similar to our Notes, convertible note hedges, warrants to purchase our stock and the forward contract that we entered into as part of our accelerated share repurchase transaction in February 2008 and which was completed in June 2008 and the forward contract that we entered into as part of our accelerated share repurchase transaction in October 2008. EITF 07-5 requires companies to use a two-step approach to evaluate an instrument contingent exercise provisions and settlement provisions in determining whether the instrument is considered to be indexed to its own stock and exempt from the application of SFAS No. 133, Accounting for Derivative Instruments and Hedging Activities . Although EITF 07-5 is effective for fiscal years beginning after December 15, 2008, any outstanding instrument at the date of adoption will require a retrospective application of the accounting through a cumulative effect adjustment to retained earnings upon adoption. We do not expect the adoption of EITF 07-5 to have a material impact on our consolidated financial position or results of operations. In May 2008, the FASB issued FSP APB 14-1, Accounting for Convertible Debt Instruments That May Be Settled in Cash upon Conversion (Including Partial Cash Settlement) (FSP APB 14-1). FSP APB 14-1 addresses instruments commonly referred to as Instrument C from EITF 90-19, which requires the issuer to settle the principal amount in cash and the conversion spread in cash or net shares at the issuer option. FSP APB 14-1 requires that issuers of these instruments account for their liability and equity components separately by bifurcating the conversion option from the debt instrument, classifying the conversion option in equity and then accreting the resulting discount on the debt as additional interest expense over the expected life of the debt. FSP APB 14-1 is effective for fiscal years beginning after December 15, 2008 and interim periods within those fiscal years, and requires retrospective application to all periods presented. Early application is not permitted. We expect that the adoption of FSP APB 14-1 will have a material impact on our consolidated financial position and results of operations. Based on the requirements of FSP APB 14-1, we estimate that if FSP APB 14-1 was effective for the current and comparative periods, we would have reported additional interest expense related to our Notes of approximately $53.2 million, $50.0 million and $32.7 million during 2008, 2007 and 2006, respectively. In December 2007, the FASB issued SFAS No. 160, Noncontrolling Interests in Consolidated Financial Statements, an amendment of Accounting Research Bulletin No. 51, Consolidated Financial Statements (SFAS 160). SFAS 160 establishes accounting and reporting standards for ownership interests in subsidiaries held by parties other than the parent, the amount of consolidated net income (loss) attributable to the parent and to the noncontrolling interests, changes in a parent ownership interest and the valuation of retained noncontrolling equity investments when a subsidiary is deconsolidated. SFAS 160 also establishes additional reporting requirements that identify and distinguish between the ownership interest of the parent and the interest of the noncontrolling owners. SFAS 160 is effective for interim periods and fiscal years beginning after December 15, 2008. Upon adopting SFAS 160, we plan to reclassify the noncontrolling interest, or minority interest, on our Consolidated Balance Sheets from liabilities to stockholders equity and to present the noncontrolling interest, or minority interest, on our Consolidated Statements of Operations as net income attributable to the noncontrolling interest, which will be a component of total consolidated net income (loss). In December 2007, the FASB issued SFAS No. 141 (revised 2007), Business Combinations (SFAS 141R). SFAS 141R establishes principles and requirements for recognizing and measuring assets acquired, liabilities assumed and any noncontrolling interests in the acquiree in a business combination. SFAS 141R also provides 65 Table of Contents guidance for recognizing and measuring goodwill acquired in a business combination; requires purchased IPR&D to be capitalized at fair value as intangible assets at the time of acquisition; requires acquisition-related expenses and restructuring costs to be recognized separately from the business combination; expands the definition of what constitutes a business; and requires the acquirer to disclose information that users may need to evaluate and understand the financial effect of the business combination. SFAS 141R is effective on a prospective basis and will impact business combination transactions for which the acquisition date occurs after December 15, 2008. Depending on the nature and magnitude of our future business combination transactions, SFAS 141R may have a material impact on our consolidated financial position and/or results of operations.
