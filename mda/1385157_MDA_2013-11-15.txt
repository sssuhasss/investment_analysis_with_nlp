ITEM 7. MANAGEMENT'S DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS OF FINANCIAL CONDITION AND RESULTS OF OPERATIONS The following discussion and analysis of our financial condition and results of operations should be read in conjunction with our Consolidated Financial Statements and the accompanying notes included elsewhere in this Annual Report. The following discussion may contain forward-looking statements that reflect our plans, estimates, and beliefs. Our actual results could differ materially from those discussed in these forward-looking statements. Factors that could cause or contribute to these differences include those factors discussed below and elsewhere in this Annual Report, particularly in "Risk Factors" and "Forward-Looking Information." Our Consolidated Financial Statements have been prepared in U.S. Dollars, in accordance with accounting principles generally accepted in the U.S. ("GAAP"). Organic net sales growth and free cash flow are non-GAAP financial measures which are discussed in Management's Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations. We believe these non-GAAP financial measures, together with GAAP financial measures, provide useful information to investors because they reflect the financial measures that management uses in evaluating the underlying results of our operations. See "Non-GAAP Financial Measures" for more information about these non-GAAP financial measures, including our reasons for including the measures and material limitations with respect to the usefulness of the measures. Overview We are a world leader in connectivity. We design and manufacture products to connect power, data, and signal in a broad array of industries including automotive, energy, industrial, broadband communications, consumer devices, healthcare, and aerospace and defense. We help our customers solve the need for more energy efficiency, always-on communications, and ever-increasing productivity. Effective for the first quarter of fiscal 2013, we reorganized our management and segments to align the organization around our strategy. We now operate through four reporting segments: Transportation Solutions, Network Solutions, Industrial Solutions, and Consumer Solutions. See Notes 1 and 23 to the Consolidated Financial Statements for additional information regarding our segments. Prior period segment results have been restated to conform to the current segment reporting structure. Our business and operating results have been and will continue to be affected by worldwide economic conditions. Our sales are dependent on certain industry end markets that are impacted by 33 Table of Contents consumer as well as industrial and infrastructure spending, and our operating results can be affected by changes in demand in those markets. Overall, our fiscal 2013 net sales and organic net sales were consistent with fiscal 2012 levels. On an organic basis, our sales into industrial- and infrastructure-based markets declined, primarily as a result of weakness in the subsea communications and data communications end markets in the Network Solutions segment and the industrial end market in the Industrial Solutions segment. Also, on an organic basis, our sales into consumer-based markets increased with growth in the automotive end market in the Transportation Solutions segment, partially offset by declines in the consumer devices and appliances end markets in the Consumer Solutions segment. Overall, our net sales decreased 3.6% in fiscal 2012 as compared to fiscal 2011. On an organic basis, net sales decreased 2.7% in fiscal 2012 from fiscal 2011 levels. On an organic basis, our sales into industrial- and infrastructure-based markets decreased, primarily as a result of weakness in the data communications, subsea communications, and telecom networks end markets in the Network Solutions segment and the industrial end market in the Industrial Solutions segment. Our sales into consumer-based markets experienced modest growth, on an organic basis, as growth in the automotive end market in the Transportation Solutions segment was partially offset by declines in the appliances and consumer devices end markets in the Consumer Solutions segment. The acquisition of Deutsch in April 2012 benefited the automotive and aerospace, defense, and marine end markets in the Transportation Solutions and Industrial Solutions segments, respectively, and contributed net sales of $327 million in fiscal 2012. Also, Deutsch contributed incremental net sales of $320 million in the first six months of fiscal 2013 over the same period of fiscal 2012. Fiscal 2011 included an additional week which contributed $267 million in net sales and $0.08 per share to diluted earnings per share. ADC, which was acquired in December 2010, contributed net sales of $843 million, of which $24 million related to the additional week, during fiscal 2011. Also, the acquisition of ADC resulted in incremental net sales of $154 million in the first quarter of fiscal 2012 over the same period of fiscal 2011. The March 2011 earthquake, subsequent tsunami, and aftershocks in Japan caused disruptions in our customers' operations and the supply chains that support their operations. We estimate that our fiscal 2011 net sales and diluted earnings per share were negatively impacted by $99 million and $0.07 per share, respectively, as a result of these disruptions. Our facilities in Japan were not materially damaged, and we did not experience further negative impacts after 2011. Outlook We expect net sales in the first quarter of fiscal 2014 to be between $3.225 billion and $3.325 billion. This reflects sales increases in the Transportation Solutions segment and, to a lesser degree, the Industrial Solutions segment, partially offset by sales decreases in the Consumer Solutions and Network Solutions segments relative to the first quarter of fiscal 2013. In the Transportation Solutions segment, we expect our sales to increase approximately 10%, and we expect global automotive production to increase 3% in the first quarter of fiscal 2014 as compared to the same period of fiscal 2013. In the Industrial Solutions segment, we expect our sales to increase approximately 10% in the industrial end market with smaller increases in the aerospace, defense, and marine and energy end markets in the first quarter of fiscal 2014 as compared to the first quarter of fiscal 2013. In the Consumer Solutions segment, we expect our sales to decline in the consumer devices end market, with this decline partially offset by a modest increase in our sales in the appliances end market in the first quarter of fiscal 2014 as compared to the same period of fiscal 2013. In the Network Solutions segment, we expect our sales to decline during the first quarter of fiscal 2014, reflecting continued weakness in the subsea communications and data communications end markets. We expect this decline 34 Table of Contents to be partially offset by sales increases in the telecom networks end market. We expect diluted earnings per share to be in the range of $0.71 to $0.75 per share in the first quarter of fiscal 2014. For fiscal 2014, we expect net sales to be between $13.65 billion and $14.15 billion, reflecting expected sales increases in the Transportation Solutions and Industrial Solutions segments and, to a lesser degree, the Consumer Solutions segment from fiscal 2013 levels. In the Transportation Solutions segment, we expect our sales growth to exceed an anticipated increase in global automotive production of approximately 4% from fiscal 2013 levels. In the Industrial Solutions segment, we expect our sales to increase in fiscal 2014 from fiscal 2013 levels in all end markets, with growth primarily in the aerospace, defense, and marine end market due to strength in commercial aviation and oil and gas markets. In the Consumer Solutions segment, we expect a slight increase in our sales in the appliances end market in fiscal 2014 while our sales in the consumer devices end market are expected to be consistent with fiscal 2013 levels. In the Network Solutions segment, we expect our fiscal 2014 sales to be consistent with fiscal 2013 levels, with increased sales in the telecom networks end market offset by decreased sales in the data communications end market. We expect diluted earnings per share to be in the range of $3.41 to $3.71 per share in fiscal 2014. The above outlook is based on foreign exchange rates and commodity prices that are consistent with current levels. We are monitoring the current macroeconomic environment and its potential effects on our customers and the end markets we serve. Additionally, we continue to closely manage our costs in line with economic conditions. We also are managing our capital resources and monitoring capital availability to ensure that we have sufficient resources to fund future capital needs. (See further discussion in "Liquidity and Capital Resources.") Acquisitions On April 3, 2012, we acquired 100% of the outstanding shares of Deutsch. The total value paid for the transaction amounted to 1.55 billion (approximately $2.05 billion using an exchange rate of $1.33 per 1.00), net of cash acquired. The total value paid included $659 million related to the repayment of Deutsch's financial debt and accrued interest. The acquired Deutsch businesses have been reported in the Transportation Solutions and Industrial Solutions segments from the date of acquisition. During fiscal 2012, Deutsch contributed net sales of $327 million and an operating loss of $54 million to our Consolidated Statement of Operations. The operating loss included charges of $75 million associated with the amortization of acquisition-related fair value adjustments primarily related to acquired inventories and customer order backlog, acquisition costs of $21 million, restructuring charges of $14 million, and integration costs of $6 million. In July 2010, we entered into an Agreement and Plan of Merger to acquire 100% of the outstanding stock of ADC, a provider of broadband communications network connectivity products and related solutions. On December 9, 2010, upon effecting a short-form merger under Minnesota law, we owned 100% of the outstanding shares of ADC for a total purchase price of approximately $1,263 million in cash (excluding cash acquired of $546 million) and $22 million representing the fair value of ADC share-based awards exchanged for TE Connectivity share options and stock appreciation rights. The acquired ADC businesses have been included in the Network Solutions segment from the date of acquisition. During fiscal 2011, ADC contributed net sales of $843 million and an operating loss of $53 million to our Consolidated Statement of Operations. The operating loss included restructuring charges of $80 million, charges of $39 million associated with the amortization of acquisition-related fair value adjustments primarily related to acquired inventories and customer order backlog, integration costs of $10 million, and acquisition costs of $9 million. See Note 5 to the Consolidated Financial Statements for additional information regarding acquisitions. 35 Table of Contents Restructuring We plan to continue to simplify our global manufacturing footprint by migrating facilities from higher-cost to lower-cost countries, consolidating within countries, and transferring product lines to lower-cost countries. These initiatives are designed to help us maintain our competitiveness in the industry, improve our operating leverage, and position us for growth in the years ahead. In connection with these initiatives and in response to market conditions, we incurred net restructuring charges of $314 million during fiscal 2013 and expect to incur net restructuring charges of approximately $50 million during fiscal 2014. Cash spending related to restructuring was $151 million during fiscal 2013, and we expect total spending, which will be funded with cash from operations, to be approximately $175 million in fiscal 2014. Annualized cost savings related to these actions are expected to be approximately $115 million and are expected to be realized by the end of fiscal 2015. Cost savings will be reflected primarily in cost of sales and selling, general, and administrative expenses. Discontinued Operations During fiscal 2012, we sold our Touch Solutions business for net cash proceeds of $380 million and recognized an insignificant pre-tax gain on the transaction. Also, during fiscal 2012, we sold our TE Professional Services business for net cash proceeds of $28 million and recognized an insignificant pre-tax gain on the transaction. See Note 4 to the Consolidated Financial Statements for additional information regarding discontinued operations. Results of Operations Key business factors that influenced our results of operations for the periods discussed in this report include: Raw material prices. We purchased approximately 172 million pounds of copper, 133,000 troy ounces of gold, and 2.5 million troy ounces of silver in fiscal 2013. Prices continue to fluctuate. The following table sets forth the average prices incurred related to copper, gold, and silver. Fiscal Measure 2013 2012 2011 Copper Lb. $ 3.51 $ 3.90 $ 3.99 Gold Troy oz. $ 1,613 $ 1,599 $ 1,382 Silver Troy oz. $ 29.18 $ 34.30 $ 30.27 In fiscal 2014, we expect to purchase copper, gold, and silver in quantities similar to fiscal 2013 levels. Foreign exchange. Approximately 53% of our net sales are invoiced in currencies other than the U.S. Dollar. Our results of operations are influenced by changes in foreign currency exchange rates. Increases or decreases in the value of the U.S. Dollar, compared to other currencies, will directly affect our reported results as we translate those currencies into U.S. Dollars at the end 36 Table of Contents of each fiscal period. The percentage of net sales in fiscal 2013 by major currencies invoiced was as follows: Currencies Percentage U.S. Dollar 47 % Euro 28 Japanese Yen 6 Chinese Renminbi 6 Korean Won 4 Brazilian Real 2 British Pound Sterling 2 All others 5 Total 100 % Consolidated Operations Net Sales. Net sales were $13,280 million and $13,282 million in fiscal 2013 and 2012, respectively. On an organic basis, net sales decreased $171 million, or 1.3%, in fiscal 2013 from fiscal 2012 as increased net sales in the Transportation Solutions segment were more than offset by decreases in the Network Solutions, Industrial Solutions, and Consumer Solutions segments. Price erosion adversely affected organic sales by $207 million in fiscal 2013. Foreign currency exchange rates negatively impacted net sales by $115 million, or 0.9%, in fiscal 2013. Deutsch, which was acquired on April 3, 2012, contributed incremental net sales of $320 million during the first six months of fiscal 2013 over the same period of fiscal 2012. Net sales decreased $496 million, or 3.6%, to $13,282 million in fiscal 2012 from $13,778 million in fiscal 2011. On an organic basis, net sales decreased $372 million, or 2.7%, in fiscal 2012 as compared to fiscal 2011 as a result of decreased net sales in the Network Solutions segment and, to a lesser degree, the Industrial Solutions and Consumer Solutions segments. Foreign currency exchange rates negatively impacted net sales by $338 million, or 2.4%, in fiscal 2012. Fiscal 2011 included an additional week which contributed $267 million in net sales. Deutsch contributed net sales of $327 million during fiscal 2012. Also, the acquisition of ADC on December 8, 2010 resulted in incremental net sales of $154 million in the first quarter of fiscal 2012 over the same period of fiscal 2011. See further discussion of organic net sales below under "Results of Operations by Segment." The following table sets forth the percentage of our total net sales by geographic region: Fiscal 2013 2012 2011 Europe/Middle East/Africa (EMEA) 34 % 34 % 36 % Asia Pacific 33 34 33 Americas 33 32 31 Total 100 % 100 % 100 % 37 Table of Contents The following table provides an analysis of the change in our net sales compared to the prior fiscal year by geographic region: Fiscal 2013 2012 Change in Net Sales versus Prior Fiscal Year Change in Net Sales versus Prior Fiscal Year Organic (1) Translation (2) Acquisition (Divestiture) Total Organic (1) Translation (2) Impact of 53 rd Week (3) Acquisitions Total ($ in millions) EMEA $ (114 ) (2.5 )% $ 28 $ 146 $ 60 1.3 % $ (214 ) (4.3 )% $ (327 ) $ (96 ) $ 181 $ (456 ) (9.2 )% Asia Pacific (31 ) (0.7 ) (113 ) (7 ) (151 ) (3.4 ) (15 ) (0.3 ) 33 (89 ) 52 (19 ) (0.4 ) Americas (26 ) (0.6 ) (30 ) 145 89 2.1 (143 ) (3.3 ) (44 ) (82 ) 248 (21 ) (0.5 ) Total $ (171 ) (1.3 )% $ (115 ) $ 284 $ (2 ) % $ (372 ) (2.7 )% $ (338 ) $ (267 ) $ 481 $ (496 ) (3.6 )% (1) Represents the change in net sales resulting from volume and price changes, before consideration of acquisitions, divestitures, the impact of changes in foreign currency exchange rates, and the impact of the 53 rd week in fiscal 2011.

In fiscal 2013, gross margin was $4,329 million, reflecting a $283 million increase from gross margin of $4,046 million in fiscal 2012. In fiscal 2012, gross margin included charges of $75 million associated with the amortization of acquisition-related fair value adjustments primarily related to acquired inventories and customer order backlog associated with Deutsch. Excluding this item, gross margin increased in fiscal 2013 as compared to fiscal 2012 due primarily to improved manufacturing productivity and, to a lesser degree, lower material costs, partially offset by price erosion. Gross margin as a percentage of net sales increased to 32.6% in fiscal 2013 from 30.5% in fiscal 2012. 38 Table of Contents In fiscal 2012, gross margin was $4,046 million, reflecting a $225 million decrease from gross margin of $4,271 million in fiscal 2011. In fiscal 2012, gross margin included charges of $75 million associated with the acquisition of Deutsch, whereas in fiscal 2011, gross margin included similar charges of $39 million associated with the acquisition of ADC. Excluding these items, gross margin decreased in fiscal 2012 as compared to fiscal 2011. The decrease resulted from lower sales levels and, to a lesser degree, increased material costs, partially offset by improved manufacturing productivity. Gross margin as a percentage of net sales decreased to 30.5% in fiscal 2012 from 31.0% in fiscal 2011. Selling, General, and Administrative Expenses. Selling, general, and administrative expenses increased $88 million to $1,773 million in fiscal 2013 from $1,685 million in fiscal 2012. The increase resulted primarily from additional selling, general, and administrative expenses of Deutsch, increased incentive compensation costs, and impairment charges on certain assets held for sale, partially offset by benefits attributable to restructuring actions. Selling, general, and administrative expenses as a percentage of net sales increased to 13.4% in fiscal 2013 from 12.7% in fiscal 2012. Selling, general, and administrative expenses decreased $43 million to $1,685 million in fiscal 2012 from $1,728 million in fiscal 2011. The decrease resulted primarily from cost control measures and benefits attributable to restructuring actions, partially offset by the additional selling, general, and administrative expenses of Deutsch. Selling, general, and administrative expenses as a percentage of net sales increased to 12.7% in fiscal 2012 from 12.5% in fiscal 2011 primarily as a result of the decrease in sales. Acquisition and Integration Costs. In connection with the acquisition of Deutsch, we incurred acquisition and integration costs of $14 million and $27 million during fiscal 2013 and 2012, respectively. In connection with the acquisition of ADC, we incurred acquisition and integration costs of $19 million during fiscal 2011. Restructuring and Other Charges, Net. Net restructuring and other charges were $311 million, $128 million, and $136 million in fiscal 2013, 2012, and 2011, respectively. During fiscal 2013, we initiated a restructuring program associated with headcount reductions and manufacturing site closures impacting all segments. During fiscal 2012, we initiated a restructuring program to reduce headcount across all segments. Also, we initiated a restructuring program in the Transportation Solutions and Industrial Solutions segments associated with the acquisition of Deutsch. We initiated a restructuring program during fiscal 2011 which was primarily associated with the acquisition of ADC and related headcount reductions in the Network Solutions segment. Additionally, in fiscal 2011, we instituted reductions-in-force across all segments as a result of economic conditions. See Note 3 to the Consolidated Financial Statements for additional information regarding net restructuring and other charges. Operating Income. Operating income was $1,556 million and $1,518 million in fiscal 2013 and 2012, respectively. Results for fiscal 2013 included $311 million of net restructuring and other charges and $14 million of acquisition and integration costs. Results for fiscal 2012 included $116 million of charges related to the acquisition of Deutsch, including $75 million of charges associated with the amortization of acquisition-related fair value adjustments primarily related to acquired inventories and customer order backlog, $27 million of acquisition and integration costs, and $14 million of net restructuring and other charges. Results for fiscal 2012 also included $114 million of additional net restructuring and other charges. Operating income was $1,518 million and $1,687 million in fiscal 2012 and 2011, respectively. As discussed above, results for fiscal 2012 included $116 million of charges related to the acquisition of Deutsch. Results for fiscal 2012 also included $114 million of additional net restructuring and other charges. Results for fiscal 2011 included $138 million of charges related to the acquisition of ADC, including $80 million of net restructuring and other charges, $39 million of charges associated with the 39 Table of Contents amortization of acquisition-related fair value adjustments primarily related to acquired inventories and customer order backlog, and $19 million of acquisition and integration costs. Results for fiscal 2011 also included $56 million of additional net restructuring and other charges and an additional week which contributed $52 million of operating income. Non-Operating Items Interest Expense, Net. Net interest expense was $125 million, $153 million, and $139 million in fiscal 2013, 2012, and 2011, respectively. The decrease of $28 million in fiscal 2013 from fiscal 2012 was due to lower average debt levels, while the increase of $14 million in fiscal 2012 from fiscal 2011 resulted from higher average debt levels. Other Income (Expense), Net. In fiscal 2013, 2012, and 2011, we recorded net other expense of $183 million, net other income of $50 million, and net other income of $27 million, respectively, primarily pursuant to the Tax Sharing Agreement with Tyco International and Covidien. See Note 12 to the Consolidated Financial Statements for further information regarding the Tax Sharing Agreement. The net other expense in fiscal 2013 included $231 million related to the effective settlement of all undisputed tax matters for the period 1997 through 2000. See Note 13 to the Consolidated Financial Statements for additional information. Income Taxes. Our operations are conducted through our various subsidiaries in a number of countries throughout the world. We have provided for income taxes based upon the tax laws and rates in the countries in which our operations are conducted and income and loss from operations is subject to taxation. The tax benefit for fiscal 2013 reflects an income tax benefit of $331 million related to the effective settlement of all undisputed tax matters for the period 1997 through 2000. In addition, the tax benefit for fiscal 2013 reflects $23 million of net tax benefits primarily consisting of income tax benefits recognized in connection with a reduction in the valuation allowance associated with certain ADC tax loss carryforwards and income tax benefits recognized in connection with the lapse of statutes of limitations for examinations of prior year income tax returns, partially offset by income tax expense related to adjustments to prior year income tax returns. We assessed the realization of ADC's tax loss and credit carryforwards that we acquired in connection with our purchase of ADC, and we believe it is more likely than not that a tax benefit will be realized on additional U.S. federal and state net operating losses. Based upon the fiscal years 2011 through 2013 U.S. operating results of the ADC business under our management, we reduced the valuation allowance provided at the date of acquisition and recorded a tax benefit of $63 million. As of fiscal year end 2013, we continue to maintain a valuation allowance of $177 million related to U.S. federal and state ADC tax attributes due to the uncertainty of their realization in the future. The tax provision for fiscal 2012 reflects an income tax benefit of $107 million recognized in connection with a reduction in the valuation allowance associated with tax loss carryforwards in certain non-U.S. locations. In addition, the tax provision for fiscal 2012 reflects $17 million of income tax expense associated with certain non-U.S. tax rate changes enacted in the quarter ended December 30, 2011. The tax provision for fiscal 2011 reflects income tax benefits of $35 million associated with the completion of fieldwork and the settlement of certain U.S. tax matters. The valuation allowance for deferred tax assets of $1,816 million and $1,719 million at fiscal year end 2013 and 2012, respectively, relates principally to the uncertainty of the utilization of certain deferred tax assets, primarily tax loss, capital loss, and credit carryforwards in various jurisdictions. We believe that we will generate sufficient future taxable income to realize the income tax benefits related to the remaining net deferred tax assets on our Consolidated Balance Sheet. The valuation allowance 40 Table of Contents was calculated in accordance with the provisions of ASC 740, Income Taxes , which require that a valuation allowance be established or maintained when it is more likely than not that all or a portion of deferred tax assets will not be realized. The calculation of our tax liabilities includes estimates for uncertainties in the application of complex tax regulations across multiple global jurisdictions where we conduct our operations. Under the uncertain tax position provisions of ASC 740, we recognize liabilities for tax and related interest for issues in the U.S. and other tax jurisdictions based on our estimate of whether, and the extent to which, additional taxes and related interest will be due. These tax liabilities and related interest are reflected net of the impact of related tax loss carryforwards, as such tax loss carryforwards will be applied against these tax liabilities and will reduce the amount of cash tax payments due upon the eventual settlement with the tax authorities. These estimates may change due to changing facts and circumstances. Due to the complexity of these uncertainties, the ultimate resolution may result in a settlement that differs from our current estimate of the tax liabilities and related interest. Furthermore, management has reviewed with tax counsel the issues raised by certain taxing authorities and the adequacy of these recorded amounts. If our current estimate of tax and interest liabilities is less than the ultimate settlement, an additional charge to income tax expense may result. If our current estimate of tax and interest liabilities is more than the ultimate settlement, income tax benefits may be recognized. We have provided income taxes for earnings that are currently distributed as well as the taxes associated with several subsidiaries' earnings that are expected to be distributed in the future. No additional provision has been made for Swiss or non-Swiss income taxes on the undistributed earnings of subsidiaries or for unrecognized deferred tax liabilities for temporary differences related to basis differences in investments in subsidiaries, as such earnings are expected to be permanently reinvested, the investments are essentially permanent in duration, or we have concluded that no additional tax liability will arise as a result of the distribution of such earnings. As of September 27, 2013, certain subsidiaries had approximately $18 billion of cumulative undistributed earnings that have been retained indefinitely and reinvested in our global manufacturing operations, including working capital, property, plant, and equipment, intangible assets, and research and development activities. A liability could arise if our intention to permanently reinvest such earnings were to change and amounts are distributed by such subsidiaries or if such subsidiaries are ultimately disposed. It is not practicable to estimate the additional income taxes related to permanently reinvested earnings or the basis differences related to investments in subsidiaries. As of September 27, 2013, we had approximately $4.5 billion of cash, cash equivalents, and intercompany deposits, principally in our subsidiaries, that we have the ability to distribute to Tyco Electronics Group S.A. ("TEGSA"), our Luxembourg subsidiary, which is the obligor of substantially all of our debt, and to TE Connectivity Ltd., our Swiss parent company, but we consider to be permanently reinvested. We estimate that up to approximately $1.5 billion of tax expense would be recognized on our Consolidated Financial Statements if our intention to permanently reinvest these amounts were to change. Our current plans do not demonstrate a need to repatriate cash, cash equivalents, and intercompany deposits that are designated as permanently reinvested in order to fund our operations, including investing and financing activities. Income (Loss) from Discontinued Operations, Net of Income Taxes. During fiscal 2012, we sold our Touch Solutions business for net cash proceeds of $380 million and recognized an insignificant pre-tax gain on the transaction. The agreement includes contingent earn-out provisions through 2015 based on business performance. In connection with the divestiture, we incurred an income tax charge of $65 million, which is included in income (loss) from discontinued operations, net of income taxes on the Consolidated Statement of Operations for fiscal 2012. This charge was primarily driven by the inability to fully realize a tax benefit associated with the write-off of goodwill at the time of the sale. During fiscal 2012, we sold our TE Professional Services business for net cash proceeds of $28 million and recognized an insignificant pre-tax gain on the transaction. Additionally, during fiscal 2012, we recorded a pre-tax impairment charge of $28 million, which is included in income (loss) from 41 Table of Contents discontinued operations, net of income taxes on the Consolidated Statement of Operations, to write the carrying value of this business down to its estimated fair value less costs to sell. In December 2011, the New York Court of Claims entered judgment in our favor in the amount of $25 million, payment of which was received in fiscal 2012, in connection with our former Wireless Systems business's State of New York contract. This judgment resolved all outstanding issues between the parties in this matter. This partial recovery of a previously recognized loss, net of legal fees, is reflected in income (loss) from discontinued operations, net of income taxes on the Consolidated Statement of Operations for fiscal 2012. The Touch Solutions, TE Professional Services, and Wireless Systems businesses met the discontinued operations criteria and have been included as such in all periods presented on our Consolidated Financial Statements. Prior to reclassification to discontinued operations, the Touch Solutions and TE Professional Services businesses were included in the former Communications and Industrial Solutions segment and the Network Solutions segment, respectively. The Wireless Systems business was a component of the former Wireless Systems segment. See Note 4 to the Consolidated Financial Statements for additional information regarding discontinued operations.

Fiscal 2013 Compared to Fiscal 2012 Net sales in the Transportation Solutions segment increased $357 million, or 7.0%, to $5,485 million in fiscal 2013 from $5,128 million in fiscal 2012. The weakening of certain foreign currencies negatively affected net sales by $54 million, or 1.1%, in fiscal 2013 as compared to fiscal 2012. Deutsch contributed incremental net sales of $160 million during the first six months of fiscal 2013 over the same period of fiscal 2012. Organic net sales increased by $251 million, or 4.9%, in fiscal 2013 as compared to fiscal 2012. 42 Table of Contents In the automotive end market, our organic net sales increased 4.9% in fiscal 2013 as compared to fiscal 2012. The increase was due primarily to growth of 9.9% in the Americas region, 5.1% in the Asia Pacific region, and 2.2% in the EMEA region. Growth in the Americas region was driven by strong consumer demand resulting in increased vehicle production. In the Asia Pacific region, growth was driven by increasing demand in China partially offset by declines in Japan. In the EMEA region, growth resulted primarily from increased exports to other regions while automotive demand was weak in the EMEA region. In fiscal 2013, operating income in the Transportation Solutions segment increased $218 million to $972 million from $754 million in fiscal 2012. Segment results for fiscal 2013 included $38 million of net restructuring and other charges and $7 million of acquisition and integration costs related to the acquisition of Deutsch. Segment results for fiscal 2012 included $67 million of charges related to the acquisition of Deutsch, including $42 million of charges associated with the amortization of acquisition-related fair value adjustments primarily related to acquired inventories and customer order backlog, $16 million of acquisition and integration costs, and $9 million of net restructuring and other charges. Segment results also included $9 million of additional net restructuring and other charges in fiscal 2012. Excluding these items, operating income increased in fiscal 2013 as compared to fiscal 2012. The increase resulted primarily from higher volume, improved manufacturing productivity, and lower material costs, partially offset by price erosion. Fiscal 2012 Compared to Fiscal 2011 In fiscal 2012, net sales in the Transportation Solutions segment increased $216 million, or 4.4%, to $5,128 million from $4,912 million in fiscal 2011. The weakening of certain foreign currencies negatively affected net sales by $181 million, or 3.7%, in fiscal 2012 as compared to fiscal 2011. Fiscal 2011 included an additional week which contributed approximately $102 million in net sales. Deutsch contributed net sales of $174 million during fiscal 2012. Organic net sales increased by $325 million, or 6.6%, in fiscal 2012 as compared to fiscal 2011. In the automotive end market, our organic net sales increased 6.6% in fiscal 2012 as compared to fiscal 2011. The increase was due primarily to growth of 15.3% in the Asia Pacific region and 11.0% in the Americas region, partially offset by declines of 1.1% in the EMEA region. Growth in the Asia Pacific region resulted from higher automotive production and continued recovery following the earthquake in Japan. We estimate that the earthquake in Japan negatively impacted our sales in the automotive end market by $38 million in fiscal 2011. In the Americas region, growth resulted from increased production in North America, partially offset by weakness in South America. In the EMEA region, production levels decreased as a result of financial uncertainty in Europe. Operating income in the Transportation Solutions segment increased $25 million to $754 million in fiscal 2012 from $729 million in fiscal 2011. As discussed above, segment results for fiscal 2012 included $67 million of charges related to the acquisition of Deutsch. Segment results also included $9 million of net charges and $13 million of net credits to restructuring and other charges (credits) in fiscal 2012 and 2011, respectively. Excluding these items, operating income increased in fiscal 2012 as compared to fiscal 2011. The increase resulted primarily from higher volume and, to a lesser degree, pricing actions and improved manufacturing productivity. 43 Table of Contents Network Solutions Fiscal 2013 2012 2011 ($ in millions) Net sales $ 3,066 $ 3,310 $ 3,671 Operating income $ 136 $ 247 $ 300 Operating margin 4.4 % 7.5 % 8.2 % The following table sets forth the Network Solutions segment's percentage of total net sales by primary industry end market (1) : Fiscal 2013 2012 2011 Telecom Networks 42 % 40 % 37 % Data Communications 25 26 29 Enterprise Networks 20 20 18 Subsea Communications 13 14 16 Total 100 % 100 % 100 % (1) Industry end market information is presented consistently with our internal management reporting and may be periodically revised as management deems necessary.

In the data communications end market, our organic net sales decreased 6.3% in fiscal 2013 from fiscal 2012 as a result of weakness in demand, particularly in the datacenter market. In the enterprise networks end 44 Table of Contents market, our organic net sales decreased 3.9% in fiscal 2013 as compared to fiscal 2012 with declines resulting primarily from continued market slowdowns in the EMEA region and North America. The subsea communications end market's organic net sales decreased 17.3% in fiscal 2013 as compared to fiscal 2012 as a result of lower levels of project activity resulting from customer funding delays. Operating income in the Network Solutions segment decreased $111 million to $136 million in fiscal 2013 from $247 million in fiscal 2012. Segment results included $125 million and $59 million of net restructuring and other charges in fiscal 2013 and 2012, respectively. Excluding these items, operating income decreased in fiscal 2013 as compared to fiscal 2012. The decrease resulted from price erosion, lower volume and, to a lesser degree, unfavorable material costs, partially offset by improved manufacturing productivity. Fiscal 2012 Compared to Fiscal 2011 Net sales in the Network Solutions segment decreased $361 million, or 9.8%, to $3,310 million in fiscal 2012 from $3,671 million in fiscal 2011. The weakening of certain foreign currencies negatively affected net sales by $66 million, or 1.8%, in fiscal 2012 as compared to fiscal 2011. Fiscal 2011 included an additional week which contributed approximately $75 million in net sales. The acquisition of ADC on December 8, 2010 resulted in incremental net sales of $154 million in the first quarter of fiscal 2012 over the same period of fiscal 2011, as ADC contributed net sales of $198 million in the first quarter of fiscal 2012 as compared to $44 million in the first quarter of fiscal 2011. Organic net sales decreased $374 million, or 10.2%, in fiscal 2012 from fiscal 2011. We estimate that the earthquake in Japan negatively impacted our sales in the Network Solutions segment by $16 million in fiscal 2011. In the telecom networks end market, our organic net sales decreased 7.9% in fiscal 2012 from fiscal 2011 due primarily to decreased capital investments by major carriers in the telecommunications industry, particularly in the Americas and EMEA regions. In the data communications end market, our organic net sales decreased 16.1% in fiscal 2012 as compared to fiscal 2011 as a result of market softness, primarily in the Asia Pacific region, and inventory reductions in the supply chain. In the enterprise networks end market, our organic net sales were flat in fiscal 2012 as compared to fiscal 2011 levels as declines resulting from weak office network demand were offset by increases resulting from continued data center investments. The subsea communications end market's organic net sales decreased 15.8% in fiscal 2012 from fiscal 2011 as a result of lower levels of project activity. In fiscal 2012, operating income in the Network Solutions segment decreased $53 million to $247 million from $300 million in fiscal 2011. Segment results for fiscal 2012 included $59 million of net restructuring and other charges.

Fiscal 2011 included an additional week which contributed approximately $53 million in net sales. Deutsch contributed net sales of $153 million in fiscal 2012. Organic net sales decreased $181 million, or 5.8%, during fiscal 2012 as compared to fiscal 2011. We estimate that the earthquake in Japan negatively impacted our sales in the Industrial Solutions segment by $11 million in fiscal 2011. In the industrial end market, our organic net sales decreased 15.1% in fiscal 2012 from fiscal 2011 due to market weakness across all regions. In the aerospace, defense, and marine end market, our organic net sales increased 5.7% in fiscal 2012 as compared to fiscal 2011. The increase was attributable to increased production in the commercial aviation market, and growth in the marine market resulting from share gains and increased oil and gas exploration driven by increased crude oil prices. In the energy end market, our organic net sales were flat in fiscal 2012 as compared to fiscal 2011 as growth in the Americas and Asia Pacific regions was offset by declines in the EMEA region. Operating income in the Industrial Solutions segment decreased $99 million to $378 million in fiscal 2012 from $477 million in fiscal 2011. As discussed above, segment results for fiscal 2012 included $49 million of charges related to the acquisition of Deutsch.

Liquidity and Capital Resources The following table summarizes our cash flow from operating, investing, and financing activities, as reflected on the Consolidated Statements of Cash Flows: Fiscal 2013 2012 2011 (in millions) Net cash provided by operating activities $ 2,046 $ 1,947 $ 1,779 Net cash used in investing activities (545 ) (1,510 ) (1,043 ) Net cash used in financing activities (1,678 ) (65 ) (1,512 ) Effect of currency translation on cash (9 ) (1 ) 5 Net increase (decrease) in cash and cash equivalents $ (186 ) $ 371 $ (771 ) Our ability to fund our future capital needs will be affected by our ability to continue to generate cash from operations and may be affected by our ability to access the capital markets, money markets, or other sources of funding, as well as the capacity and terms of our financing arrangements. We believe that cash generated from operations and, to the extent necessary, these other sources of potential funding will be sufficient to meet our anticipated capital needs for the foreseeable future. In October, we called for early redemption all of our 5.95% senior notes due in January 2014. We may use excess cash to reduce our outstanding debt, including through the possible repurchase of our debt in accordance with applicable law, to purchase a portion of our common shares pursuant to our authorized share repurchase program, to pay distributions or dividends on our common shares, or to acquire strategic businesses or product lines. The cost or availability of future funding may be impacted by financial market conditions. We will continue to monitor financial markets and respond as necessary to changing conditions. As of September 27, 2013, our cash and cash equivalents were held in subsidiaries which are located in various countries throughout the world. Under current applicable laws, substantially all of these amounts can be repatriated to TEGSA, our Luxembourg subsidiary, which is the obligor of substantially all of our debt, and to TE Connectivity Ltd., our Swiss parent company; however, the repatriation of these amounts could subject us to additional tax costs. We provide for tax liabilities on our Consolidated Financial Statements with respect to amounts that we expect to repatriate; however, no tax liabilities are recorded for amounts that we consider to be retained indefinitely and reinvested in our global manufacturing operations. As of September 27, 2013, we had approximately $4.5 billion of cash, cash equivalents, and intercompany deposits, principally in our subsidiaries, that we have the ability to distribute to TEGSA, our Luxembourg subsidiary, and TE Connectivity Ltd., our Swiss parent company, but we consider to be permanently reinvested. We estimate that up to approximately $1.5 billion of tax expense would be recognized on our Consolidated Financial Statements if our intention to permanently reinvest these amounts were to change. Our current plans do not demonstrate a need to repatriate cash, cash equivalents, and intercompany deposits that are designated as permanently reinvested in order to fund our operations, including investing and financing activities. 49 Table of Contents Cash Flows from Operating Activities Net cash provided by continuing operating activities was $2,048 million in fiscal 2013 as compared to $1,888 million in fiscal 2012. The increase of $160 million in fiscal 2013 over fiscal 2012 resulted primarily from higher income levels. Net cash provided by continuing operating activities was $1,888 million in fiscal 2012 as compared to $1,722 million in fiscal 2011. The increase of $166 million in fiscal 2012 over fiscal 2011 resulted primarily from improved working capital, partially offset by lower income levels. Pension and postretirement benefit contributions in fiscal 2013, 2012, and 2011 were $98 million, $98 million, and $90 million, respectively. We expect pension and postretirement benefit contributions to be $90 million in fiscal 2014, before consideration of any voluntary contributions. There were no voluntary pension contributions in fiscal 2013, 2012, and 2011. The amount of income taxes paid, net of refunds, during fiscal 2013, 2012, and 2011 was $312 million, $290 million, and $299 million, respectively. In fiscal 2013 and 2012, cash payments included $67 million and $70 million, respectively, for tax deficiencies related to U.S. tax matters for the years 1997 through 2000. Also during fiscal 2013 and 2012, we received net reimbursements of $39 million and $51 million, respectively, from Tyco International and Covidien pursuant to their indemnifications for pre-separation U.S. tax matters. Net cash payments related to pre-separation tax matters were $129 million in fiscal 2011. We expect to make net cash payments related to pre-separation tax matters of approximately $182 million over the next twelve months. These amounts include payments in which we are the primary obligor to the taxing authorities and for which we expect a portion to be reimbursed by Tyco International and Covidien under the Tax Sharing Agreement as well as indemnification payments to Tyco International and Covidien under the Tax Sharing Agreement for tax matters where they are the primary obligor to the taxing authorities. See Note 13 to the Consolidated Financial Statements for additional information related to pre-separation tax matters. In addition to net cash provided by operating activities, we use free cash flow, a non-GAAP financial measure, as a useful measure of our ability to generate cash. Free cash flow was $1,500 million in fiscal 2013 as compared to $1,434 million in fiscal 2012 and $1,342 million in fiscal 2011. The increase in free cash flow in fiscal 2013 as compared to fiscal 2012 was primarily driven by higher income levels, partially offset by higher capital expenditures as reduced by proceeds from the sale of property, plant, and equipment. The increase in free cash flow in fiscal 2012 as compared to fiscal 2011 was primarily driven by improved working capital, as adjusted for net payments for pre-separation tax matters and certain Deutsch acquisition-related payments totaling $37 million, partially offset by lower income levels. 50 Table of Contents The following table sets forth a reconciliation of net cash provided by continuing operating activities, the most comparable GAAP financial measure, to free cash flow. Fiscal 2013 2012 2011 (in millions) Net cash provided by continuing operating activities $ 2,048 $ 1,888 $ 1,722 Capital expenditures (615 ) (533 ) (574 ) Proceeds from sale of property, plant, and equipment 39 23 65 Payments related to pre-separation tax matters, net 28 19 129 Payments related to accrued interest on debt assumed in the acquisition of Deutsch 17 Payments to settle acquisition-related foreign currency derivative contracts 20 Free cash flow $ 1,500 $ 1,434 $ 1,342 Cash Flows from Investing Activities Capital spending increased $82 million in fiscal 2013 to $615 million as compared to $533 million in fiscal 2012. Capital spending was $574 million in fiscal 2011. We expect fiscal 2014 capital spending levels to be approximately 4% to 5% of net sales. We believe our capital funding levels are adequate to support new programs, and we continue to invest in our manufacturing infrastructure to further enhance productivity and manufacturing capabilities. During fiscal 2012, we acquired Deutsch. The total value paid for the transaction amounted to 1.55 billion (approximately $2.05 billion using an exchange rate of $1.33 per 1.00), net of cash acquired of $152 million. The total value paid included $659 million of debt assumed, including accrued interest, which we paid off in its entirety shortly after the completion of the acquisition. See additional information in Note 5 to the Consolidated Financial Statements. During fiscal 2011, we acquired ADC for a total purchase price of approximately $1,263 million in cash (excluding cash acquired of $546 million) and $22 million of other non-cash consideration. Short-term investments acquired in connection with the acquisition of ADC were sold for proceeds of $155 million in fiscal 2011. Certain other assets acquired in connection with the acquisition of ADC were sold for net proceeds of $111 million, of which approximately $106 million was received in fiscal 2011. See Note 5 to the Consolidated Financial Statements for additional information. During fiscal 2012, we received net cash proceeds of $370 million related to the sale of our Touch Solutions business and $24 million related to the sale of our TE Professional Services business. An additional $14 million of cash proceeds was received during fiscal 2013. See additional information in Note 4 to the Consolidated Financial Statements. Cash Flows from Financing Activities and Capitalization Total debt at fiscal year end 2013 and 2012 was $3,014 million and $3,711 million, respectively. See Note 11 to the Consolidated Financial Statements for additional information regarding debt. TEGSA, our 100%-owned subsidiary, has a five-year unsecured senior revolving credit facility ("Credit Facility") with total commitments of $1,500 million. The Credit Facility was amended in August 2013 primarily to extend the maturity date from June 2016 to August 2018 and reduce borrowing costs. TEGSA had no borrowings under the Credit Facility at September 27, 2013 and September 28, 2012. Borrowings under the Credit Facility bear interest at a rate per annum equal to, at the option of TEGSA, (1) the London interbank offered rate ("LIBOR") plus an applicable margin based upon the 51 Table of Contents senior, unsecured, long-term debt rating of TEGSA, or (2) an alternate base rate equal to the highest of (i) Deutsche Bank AG New York branch's base rate, (ii) the federal funds effective rate plus 1 / 2 of 1%, and (iii) one-month LIBOR plus 1%, plus, in each case, an applicable margin based upon the senior, unsecured, long-term debt rating of TEGSA. TEGSA is required to pay an annual facility fee ranging from 7.5 to 25.0 basis points based upon the amount of the lenders' commitments under the Credit Facility and the applicable credit ratings of TEGSA. The Credit Facility contains a financial ratio covenant providing that if, as of the last day of each fiscal quarter, our ratio of Consolidated Total Debt (as defined in the Credit Facility) to Consolidated EBITDA (as defined in the Credit Facility) for the then most recently concluded period of four consecutive fiscal quarters exceeds 3.75 to 1.0, an Event of Default (as defined in the Credit Facility) is triggered. The Credit Facility and our other debt agreements contain other customary covenants. None of our covenants are presently considered restrictive to our operations. As of September 27, 2013, we were in compliance with all of our debt covenants and believe that we will continue to be in compliance with our existing covenants for the foreseeable future. Periodically, TEGSA issues commercial paper to U.S. institutional accredited investors and qualified institutional buyers in accordance with available exemptions from the registration requirements of the Securities Act of 1933 as part of our ongoing effort to maintain financial flexibility and to potentially decrease the cost of borrowings. Borrowings under the commercial paper program are backed by the Credit Facility. As of fiscal year end 2013, TEGSA had $350 million of commercial paper outstanding at a weighted-average interest rate of 0.28%. TEGSA had $300 million of commercial paper outstanding at a weighted-average interest rate of 0.40% as of fiscal year end 2012. TEGSA's payment obligations under its senior notes, commercial paper, and Credit Facility are fully and unconditionally guaranteed by its parent, TE Connectivity Ltd. Neither TE Connectivity Ltd. nor any of its subsidiaries provides a guarantee as to payment obligations under the 3.50% convertible subordinated notes due 2015 issued by ADC prior to its acquisition in December 2010. On October 18, 2013, TEGSA called for redemption all of its outstanding 5.95% senior notes due 2014, representing $300 million aggregate principal amount. The redemption date will be November 18, 2013. We expect to pay an immaterial premium in connection with this early redemption. Payments of common share dividends and cash distributions to shareholders were $384 million, $332 million, and $296 million in fiscal 2013, 2012, and 2011, respectively. In March 2010, our shareholders approved a cash distribution to shareholders in the form of a capital reduction to the par value of our common shares of CHF 0.72 (equivalent to $0.64) per share, payable in four equal quarterly installments of $0.16 per share beginning in the third quarter of fiscal 2010 through the second quarter of fiscal 2011. We paid the third and fourth installments of the distribution during the quarters ended December 24, 2010 and March 25, 2011, respectively. These capital reductions reduced the par value of our common shares from CHF 1.73 (equivalent to $1.60) to CHF 1.37 (equivalent to $1.28). In March 2011, our shareholders approved a dividend payment to shareholders of CHF 0.68 (equivalent to $0.72) per share out of contributed surplus, payable in four equal quarterly installments beginning in the third quarter of fiscal 2011 through the second quarter of fiscal 2012. We paid the installments of the dividend at a rate of $0.18 per share during each of the quarters ended June 24, 2011, September 30, 2011, December 30, 2011, and March 30, 2012. In March 2012, our shareholders approved a cash distribution to shareholders in the form of a capital reduction to the par value of our common shares of CHF 0.80 (equivalent to $0.84) per share, payable in four equal quarterly installments beginning in the third quarter of fiscal 2012 through the second quarter of fiscal 2013. We paid the installments of the distribution at a rate of $0.21 per share during each of the quarters ended June 29, 2012, September 28, 2012, December 28, 2012 and March 29, 2013. These capital reductions reduced the par value of our common shares from CHF 1.37 (equivalent to $1.28) to CHF 0.57 (equivalent to $0.44). 52 Table of Contents In March 2013, our shareholders approved a dividend payment to shareholders of CHF 0.96 (equivalent to $1.00) per share out of contributed surplus, payable in four equal quarterly installments beginning in the third quarter of fiscal 2013 through the second quarter of fiscal 2014. We paid the first and second installments of the dividend at a rate of $0.25 per share during each of the quarters ended June 28, 2013 and September 27, 2013. Future dividends on our common shares or reductions of registered share capital for distribution to shareholders, if any, must be approved by our shareholders. In exercising their discretion to recommend to the shareholders that such dividends or distributions be approved, our board of directors will consider our results of operations, cash requirements and surplus, financial condition, statutory requirements of applicable law, contractual restrictions, and other factors that they may deem relevant. During fiscal 2013, 2012, and 2011, we repurchased approximately 20 million of our common shares for $829 million, approximately 6 million of our common shares for $194 million, and approximately 25 million of our common shares for $867 million, respectively. At September 27, 2013, we had $478 million of availability remaining under our share repurchase authorization. On October 29, 2013, our board of directors authorized an increase of $1 billion in the share repurchase program. Commitments and Contingencies The following table provides a summary of our contractual obligations and commitments for debt, minimum lease payment obligations under non-cancelable leases, and other obligations at fiscal year end 2013: Payments Due by Fiscal Year Total 2014 2015 2016 2017 2018 Thereafter (in millions) Long-term debt, including current maturities $ 3,014 $ 711 $ 339 $ $ $ 727 $ 1,237 Interest on long-term debt (1) 1,304 128 115 110 110 87 754 Operating leases 420 125 96 58 41 30 70 Purchase obligations (2) 226 226 Total contractual cash obligations (3)(4)(5) $ 4,964 $ 1,190 $ 550 $ 168 $ 151 $ 844 $ 2,061 (1) Interest payments exclude the impact of our interest rate swaps. (2) Purchase obligations consist of commitments for purchases of goods and services. (3) The table above does not reflect unrecognized income tax benefits of $1,620 million and related accrued interest and penalties of $1,018 million, the timing of which is uncertain. See Note 17 to the Consolidated Financial Statements for additional information regarding unrecognized income tax benefits, interest, and penalties. (4) The table above does not reflect pension and postretirement benefit obligations to certain employees and former employees. We are obligated to make contributions to our pension plans and postretirement benefit plans; however, we are unable to determine the amount of plan contributions due to the inherent uncertainties of obligations of this type, including timing, interest rate charges, investment performance, and amounts of benefit payments. We expect to contribute $90 million to pension and postretirement benefit plans in fiscal 2014, before consideration of voluntary contributions. These plans and our estimates of future contributions and benefit payments are more fully described in Note 16 to the Consolidated Financial Statements. (5) Other long-term liabilities of $393 million are excluded from the table above as we are unable to estimate the timing of payment for these items. Income Tax Matters In connection with our separation from Tyco International in 2007, we entered into a Tax Sharing Agreement that generally governs our, Tyco International's, and Covidien's respective rights, responsibilities, and obligations after the distribution with respect to taxes, including ordinary course of 53 Table of Contents business taxes and taxes, if any, incurred as a result of any failure of the distribution of all of our shares or the shares of Covidien to qualify as a tax-free distribution for U.S. federal income tax purposes within the meaning of Section 355 of the Code or certain internal transactions undertaken in anticipation of the spin-offs to qualify for tax-favored treatment under the Code. Pursuant to the Tax Sharing Agreement, upon separation, we entered into certain guarantee commitments and indemnifications with Tyco International and Covidien. Under the Tax Sharing Agreement, we, Tyco International, and Covidien share 31%, 27%, and 42%, respectively, of certain contingent liabilities relating to unresolved pre-separation tax matters of Tyco International. The effect of the Tax Sharing Agreement is to indemnify us for 69% of certain liabilities settled in cash by us with respect to unresolved pre-separation tax matters. Pursuant to that indemnification, we have made similar indemnifications to Tyco International and Covidien with respect to 31% of certain liabilities settled in cash by the companies relating to unresolved pre-separation tax matters. If any of the companies responsible for all or a portion of such liabilities were to default in its payment of costs or expenses related to any such liability, we would be responsible for a portion of the defaulting party or parties' obligation. We are responsible for all of our own taxes that are not shared pursuant to the Tax Sharing Agreement's sharing formula. In addition, Tyco International and Covidien are responsible for their tax liabilities that are not subject to the Tax Sharing Agreement's sharing formula. Prior to separation, certain of our subsidiaries filed combined income tax returns with Tyco International. Those and other of our subsidiaries' income tax returns are periodically examined by various tax authorities. In connection with these examinations, tax authorities, including the IRS, have raised issues and proposed tax adjustments. Tyco International, as the U.S. income tax audit controlling party under the Tax Sharing Agreement, is reviewing and contesting certain of the proposed tax adjustments. Amounts related to these tax adjustments and other tax contingencies and related interest that management has assessed under the uncertain tax position provisions of ASC 740, which relate specifically to our entities have been recorded on the Consolidated Financial Statements. In addition, we may be required to fund portions of Tyco International's and Covidien's tax obligations. Estimates about these guarantees have also been recognized on the Consolidated Financial Statements. See Note 12 to the Consolidated Financial Statements for additional information. During fiscal 2007, the IRS concluded its field examination of certain of Tyco International's U.S. federal income tax returns for the years 1997 through 2000 and issued Revenue Agent Reports that reflected the IRS' determination of proposed tax adjustments for the 1997 through 2000 period. Additionally, the IRS proposed civil fraud penalties against Tyco International arising from alleged actions of former executives in connection with certain intercompany transfers of stock in 1998 and 1999. The penalties were asserted against a prior subsidiary of Tyco International that was distributed to us in connection with the separation. Tyco International appealed certain of the proposed adjustments for the years 1997 through 2000, and Tyco International resolved all but one of the matters associated with the proposed tax adjustments, including reaching an agreement with the IRS on the penalty adjustment in the amount of $21 million. In October 2012, the IRS issued special agreement Forms 870-AD, effectively settling its audit of all tax matters for the period 1997 through 2000, excluding one issue that remains in dispute as described below. As a result of these developments, in fiscal 2013, we recognized an income tax benefit of $331 million and other expense of $231 million pursuant to the Tax Sharing Agreement with Tyco International and Covidien. The disputed issue involves the tax treatment of certain intercompany debt transactions. The IRS field examination asserted that certain intercompany loans originating during the period 1997 through 2000 did not constitute debt for U.S. federal income tax purposes and disallowed approximately $2.7 billion of related interest deductions recognized during the period on Tyco International's U.S. income tax returns. In addition, if the IRS is ultimately successful in asserting its claim, it is likely to disallow an additional $6.6 billion of interest deductions reflected on U.S. income tax returns in years subsequent to fiscal 2000. Tyco International contends that the intercompany financing qualified as debt 54 Table of Contents for U.S. tax purposes and that the interest deductions reflected on the income tax returns are appropriate. The IRS and Tyco International were unable to resolve this matter through the IRS appeals process. On June 20, 2013, Tyco International advised us that it had received Notices of Deficiency from the IRS for certain former U.S. subsidiaries of Tyco International increasing taxable income by approximately $2.9 billion in connection with the audit of Tyco International's fiscal years 1997 through 2000. The Notices of Deficiency assert that Tyco International owes additional taxes totaling $778 million, associated penalties of $154 million, and withholding taxes of $105 million. In addition, Tyco International received Final Partnership Administrative Adjustments for certain U.S. partnerships owned by former U.S. subsidiaries with respect to which Tyco International estimates an additional tax deficiency of approximately $30 million will be asserted. The amounts asserted by the IRS exclude any applicable deficiency interest, and do not reflect any impact to subsequent period tax liabilities in the event that the IRS were to prevail on some or all of its assertions. We understand that Tyco International strongly disagrees with the IRS position and has filed petitions in the U.S. Tax Court contesting the IRS' proposed adjustments. Tyco International has advised us that it believes there are meritorious defenses for the tax filings in question and that the IRS positions with regard to these matters are inconsistent with the applicable tax laws and existing Treasury regulations. Resolution of this matter in the U.S. Tax Court could take several years and no payments to the IRS with respect to these matters would be required until the matter is fully and finally resolved. In accordance with the terms of a tax sharing agreement, we, Tyco International, and Covidien would share 31%, 27%, and 42%, respectively, of any payments made in connection with these matters. However, as the ultimate outcome is uncertain and if the IRS were to prevail on its assertions, our share of the assessed tax, deficiency interest, and applicable withholding taxes and penalties could have a material adverse impact on our results of operations, financial position, and cash flows. We have reviewed the Notices of Deficiency, the relevant facts surrounding the intercompany debt transactions, relevant tax regulations, and applicable case law, and we continue to believe that we are appropriately reserved for this matter. During fiscal 2013 and 2012, we made payments of $67 million and $70 million, respectively, for tax deficiencies related to undisputed tax adjustments for the years 1997 through 2000. Concurrent with remitting these payments, during fiscal 2013 and 2012, we were reimbursed $39 million and $51 million, respectively, from Tyco International and Covidien pursuant to their indemnifications for pre-separation tax matters. During fiscal 2011, the IRS completed its field examination of certain Tyco International income tax returns for the years 2001 through 2004, issued Revenue Agent Reports which reflect the IRS' determination of proposed tax adjustments for the 2001 through 2004 period, and issued certain notices of deficiency. As a result of the completion of fieldwork and the settlement of certain tax matters in fiscal 2011, we recognized income tax benefits of $35 million and other expense of $14 million pursuant to the Tax Sharing Agreement. Also, in fiscal 2011, we made net cash payments of $154 million related to pre-separation deficiencies. Tyco International's income tax returns for the years 2001 through 2004 remain subject to adjustment by the IRS upon ultimate resolution of the disputed issue involving certain intercompany loans originated during the period 1997 through 2000. The IRS commenced its audit of certain Tyco International income tax returns for the years 2005 through 2007 in fiscal 2011, and it is our understanding that fieldwork for this audit period is expected to be completed in fiscal 2014. Also, during fiscal 2012, the IRS commenced its audit of our income tax returns for the years 2008 through 2010. We expect fieldwork for the 2008 through 2010 audit to conclude in fiscal 2014. Over the next twelve months, we expect to pay approximately $182 million, inclusive of related indemnification payments, in connection with pre-separation tax matters. 55 Table of Contents At September 27, 2013 and September 28, 2012, we have reflected $15 million and $71 million, respectively, of income tax liabilities related to the audits of Tyco International's and our income tax returns in accrued and other current liabilities as certain of these matters could be resolved within the next twelve months. We believe that the amounts recorded on our Consolidated Financial Statements relating to the matters discussed above are appropriate. However, the ultimate resolution is uncertain and could result in a material impact to our results of operations, financial position, or cash flows. Legal Proceedings In the ordinary course of business, we are subject to various legal proceedings and claims, including patent infringement claims, product liability matters, employment disputes, disputes on agreements, other commercial disputes, environmental matters, antitrust claims, and tax matters, including non-income tax matters such as value added tax, sales and use tax, real estate tax, and transfer tax. Management believes that these legal proceedings and claims likely will be resolved over an extended period of time. Although it is not feasible to predict the outcome of these proceedings, based upon our experience, current information, and applicable law, we do not expect that the outcome of these proceedings, either individually or in the aggregate, will have a material effect on our results of operations, financial position, or cash flows. However, the proceedings discussed above in "Income Tax Matters" could have a material effect on our results of operations, financial position, or cash flows. See "Part I. Item 3. Legal Proceedings" and Note 13 to the Consolidated Financial Statements for further information regarding legal proceedings. At September 27, 2013, we had a contingent purchase price commitment of $80 million related to our fiscal 2001 acquisition of Com-Net. This represents the maximum amount payable to the former shareholders of Com-Net only after the construction and installation of a communications system was completed for and approved by the State of Florida in accordance with guidelines set forth in the contract. Under the terms of the purchase and sale agreement, we do not believe we have any obligation to the sellers. However, the sellers have contested our position and initiated a lawsuit in June 2006 in the Court of Common Pleas in Allegheny County, Pennsylvania, which is in the discovery phase. A liability for this contingency has not been recorded on the Consolidated Financial Statements as we do not believe that any payment is probable at this time. Off-Balance Sheet Arrangements In certain instances, we have guaranteed the performance of third parties and provided financial guarantees for uncompleted work and financial commitments. The terms of these guarantees vary with end dates ranging from fiscal 2014 through the completion of such transactions. The guarantees would be triggered in the event of nonperformance, and the potential exposure for nonperformance under the guarantees would not have a material effect on our results of operations, financial position, or cash flows. In disposing of assets or businesses, we often provide representations, warranties, and/or indemnities to cover various risks including unknown damage to assets, environmental risks involved in the sale of real estate, liability for investigation and remediation of environmental contamination at waste disposal sites and manufacturing facilities, and unidentified tax liabilities and legal fees related to periods prior to disposition. We do not expect that these uncertainties will have a material adverse effect on our results of operations, financial position, or cash flows. At September 27, 2013, we had outstanding letters of credit and letters of guarantee in the amount of $376 million. 56 Table of Contents We have recorded liabilities for known indemnifications included as part of environmental liabilities. See Note 13 to the Consolidated Financial Statements for a discussion of these liabilities. In the normal course of business, we are liable for contract completion and product performance. In the opinion of management, such obligations will not significantly affect our results of operations, financial position, or cash flows. Pursuant to the Tax Sharing Agreement, upon separation, we entered into certain guarantee commitments and indemnifications with Tyco International and Covidien. Under the Tax Sharing Agreement, we, Tyco International, and Covidien share 31%, 27%, and 42%, respectively, of certain contingent liabilities relating to unresolved pre-separation tax matters of Tyco International. The effect of the Tax Sharing Agreement is to indemnify us for 69% of certain liabilities settled in cash by us with respect to unresolved pre-separation tax matters. Pursuant to that indemnification, we have made similar indemnifications to Tyco International and Covidien with respect to 31% of certain liabilities settled in cash by the companies relating to unresolved pre-separation tax matters. If any of the companies responsible for all or a portion of such liabilities were to default in its payment of costs or expenses related to any such liability, we would be responsible for a portion of the defaulting party or parties' obligation. These arrangements have been valued upon our separation from Tyco International in accordance with ASC 460 and, accordingly, liabilities amounting to $223 million were recorded on the Consolidated Balance Sheet at September 27, 2013. See Notes 12 and 13 to the Consolidated Financial Statements for additional information. Critical Accounting Policies and Estimates The preparation of the Consolidated Financial Statements in conformity with GAAP requires management to make estimates and assumptions that affect the reported amounts of assets and liabilities, the disclosure of contingent assets and liabilities, and the reported amounts of revenue and expenses. Our significant accounting policies are summarized in Note 2 to the Consolidated Financial Statements. The following accounting policies are considered to be the most critical as they require significant judgments and assumptions that involve inherent risks and uncertainties. Management's estimates are based on the relevant information available at the end of each period. Revenue Recognition Our revenue recognition policies are in accordance with ASC 605, Revenue Recognition . Our revenues are generated principally from the sale of our products. Revenue from the sale of products is recognized at the time title and the risks and rewards of ownership pass to the customer. This generally occurs when the products reach the shipping point, the sales price is fixed and determinable, and collection is reasonably assured. For those items where title has not yet transferred, we have deferred the recognition of revenue. A reserve for estimated returns is established at the time of sale based on historical return experience and is recorded as a reduction of sales. Other allowances include customer quantity and price discrepancies. A reserve for other allowances is generally established at the time of sale based on historical experience and is also recorded as a reduction of sales. Contract revenues for construction related projects, which are generated in the Network Solutions segment, are recorded primarily using the percentage-of-completion method. Profits recognized on contracts in process are based upon estimated contract revenue and related cost to complete. Percentage-of-completion is measured based on the ratio of actual costs incurred to total estimated costs. Revisions in cost estimates as contracts progress have the effect of increasing or decreasing profits in the current period. Provisions for anticipated losses are made in the period in which they first become determinable. In addition, provisions for credit losses related to construction related projects are recorded as reductions of revenue in the period in which they first become determinable. 57 Table of Contents Goodwill and Other Intangible Assets Acquired intangible assets include both indeterminable-lived residual goodwill and determinable-lived identifiable intangible assets. Intangible assets with a determinable life include primarily intellectual property, consisting of patents, trademarks, and unpatented technology, as well as customer relationships. Estimates of recoverability range from 1 to 50 years and are generally amortized on a straight-line basis. An evaluation of the remaining useful life of determinable-lived intangible assets is performed on a periodic basis and when events and circumstances warrant an evaluation. We assess determinable-lived intangible assets for impairment consistent with our policy for assessing other long-lived assets for impairment. Goodwill is assessed for impairment separately from determinable-lived intangible assets by comparing the carrying value of each reporting unit to its fair value on the first day of the fourth fiscal quarter of each year or whenever we believe a triggering event requiring a more frequent assessment has occurred. In assessing the existence of a triggering event, management relies on a number of reporting-unit-specific factors including operating results, business plans, economic projections, anticipated future cash flows, transactions, and market place data. There are inherent uncertainties related to these factors and management's judgment in applying these factors to the goodwill impairment analysis. A reporting unit is generally an operating segment or one level below an operating segment that constitutes a business for which discrete financial information is available and regularly reviewed by segment management. At fiscal year end 2013, we had eight reporting units, seven of which contained goodwill. There is one reporting unit in the Transportation Solutions segment, three reporting units in the Network Solutions segment, and two reporting units in both the Industrial Solutions and Consumer Solutions segments. We review our reporting unit structure each year as part of our annual goodwill impairment test, or more frequently based on changes in our structure. When testing for goodwill impairment, we follow the guidance prescribed in ASC 350, Intangibles Goodwill and Other . First, we perform a step I goodwill impairment test to identify a potential impairment. In doing so, we compare the fair value of a reporting unit with its carrying amount. If the carrying amount of a reporting unit exceeds its fair value, goodwill may be impaired and a step II goodwill impairment test is performed to measure the amount of impairment, if any. In the step II goodwill impairment test, we compare the implied fair value of reporting unit goodwill with the carrying amount of that goodwill. If the carrying amount of reporting unit goodwill exceeds the implied fair value of that goodwill, an impairment loss is recognized in an amount equal to the excess. The implied fair value of goodwill is determined in a manner consistent with how goodwill is recognized in a business combination. We allocate the fair value of a reporting unit to all of the assets and liabilities of that unit, including intangible assets, as if the reporting unit had been acquired in a business combination. Any excess of the fair value of a reporting unit over the amounts assigned to its assets and liabilities is the implied fair value of goodwill. Fair value estimates used in the step I goodwill impairment tests are calculated using an income approach based on the present value of future cash flows of each reporting unit. The income approach generally has been supported by guideline analyses (a market approach). These approaches incorporate a number of assumptions including future growth rates, discount rates, income tax rates, and market activity in assessing fair value and are reporting unit specific. Changes in economic and operating conditions impacting these assumptions could result in goodwill impairments in future periods. We completed our annual goodwill impairment test in the fourth quarter of fiscal 2013 and determined that no impairment existed. Income Taxes In determining income for financial statement purposes, we must make certain estimates and judgments. These estimates and judgments affect the calculation of certain tax liabilities and the 58 Table of Contents determination of the recoverability of certain deferred tax assets, which arise from temporary differences between the income tax return and financial statement recognition of revenue and expense. In evaluating our ability to recover our deferred tax assets, we consider all available positive and negative evidence including our past operating results, the existence of cumulative losses in the most recent years, and our forecast of future taxable income. In estimating future taxable income, we develop assumptions including the amount of future state, federal, and non-U.S. pre-tax operating income, the reversal of temporary differences, and the implementation of feasible and prudent tax planning strategies. These assumptions require significant judgment about the forecasts of future taxable income and are consistent with the plans and estimates we are using to manage the underlying businesses. We currently have recorded significant valuation allowances that we intend to maintain until it is more likely than not the deferred tax assets will be realized. Our income tax expense recorded in the future will be reduced to the extent of decreases in our valuation allowances. The realization of our remaining deferred tax assets is primarily dependent on future taxable income in the appropriate jurisdictions. Any reduction in future taxable income including any future restructuring activities may require that we record an additional valuation allowance against our deferred tax assets. An increase in the valuation allowance would result in additional income tax expense in such period and could have a significant impact on our future earnings. Any changes in a valuation allowance that was established in connection with an acquisition will be reflected in the income tax provision. Changes in tax laws and rates also could affect recorded deferred tax assets and liabilities in the future. Management is not aware of any such changes that would have a material effect on our results of operations, financial position, or cash flows. In addition, the calculation of our tax liabilities includes estimates for uncertainties in the application of complex tax regulations across multiple global jurisdictions where we conduct our operations. Under the uncertain tax position provisions of ASC 740, Income Taxes , we recognize liabilities for tax and related interest for issues in the U.S. and other tax jurisdictions based on our estimate of whether, and the extent to which, additional taxes and related interest will be due. These tax liabilities and related interest are reflected net of the impact of related tax loss carryforwards, as such tax loss carryforwards will be applied against these tax liabilities and will reduce the amount of cash tax payments due upon the eventual settlement with the tax authorities. These estimates may change due to changing facts and circumstances. Due to the complexity of these uncertainties, the ultimate resolution may result in a settlement that differs from our current estimate of the tax liabilities and related interest. Furthermore, management has reviewed with tax counsel the issues raised by certain taxing authorities and the adequacy of these recorded amounts. If our current estimate of tax and interest liabilities is less than the ultimate settlement, an additional charge to income tax expense may result. If our current estimate of tax and interest liabilities is more than the ultimate settlement, income tax benefits may be recognized. These tax liabilities and related interest are recorded in income taxes and accrued and other current liabilities on the Consolidated Balance Sheets. Pension and Postretirement Benefits Our pension expense and obligations are developed from actuarial assumptions. The funded status of our defined benefit pension and postretirement benefit plans is recognized on the Consolidated Balance Sheets and is measured as the difference between the fair value of plan assets and the benefit obligation at the measurement date. For defined benefit pension plans, the benefit obligation is the projected benefit obligation, which represents the actuarial present value of benefits expected to be paid upon retirement factoring in estimated future compensation levels. For the postretirement benefit plans, the benefit obligation is the accumulated postretirement benefit obligation, which represents the actuarial present value of postretirement benefits attributed to employee services already rendered. The 59 Table of Contents fair value of plan assets represents the current market value of cumulative company and participant contributions made to irrevocable trust funds, held for the sole benefit of participants, which are invested by the trustee of the funds. The benefits under pension and postretirement plans are based on various factors, such as years of service and compensation. Net periodic pension benefit cost is based on the utilization of the projected unit credit method of calculation and is charged to earnings on a systematic basis over the expected average remaining service lives of current participants. Two critical assumptions in determining pension expense and obligations are the discount rate and expected long-term return on plan assets. We evaluate these assumptions at least annually. Other assumptions reflect demographic factors such as retirement, mortality, and employee turnover. These assumptions are evaluated periodically and updated to reflect our actual experience. Actual results may differ from actuarial assumptions. The discount rate represents the market rate for high-quality fixed income investments and is used to calculate the present value of the expected future cash flows for benefit obligations to be paid under our pension plans. A decrease in the discount rate increases the present value of pension benefit obligations. At fiscal year end 2013, a 25 basis point decrease in the discount rate would have increased the present value of our pension obligations by $124 million; a 25 basis point increase would have decreased the present value of our pension obligations by $112 million. We consider the current and expected asset allocations of our pension plans, as well as historical and expected long-term rates of return on those types of plan assets, in determining the expected long-term rate of return on plan assets. A 50 basis point decrease or increase in the expected long-term return on plan assets would have increased or decreased, respectively, our fiscal 2013 pension expense by $10 million. During fiscal 2012, our investment committee made the decision to change the target asset allocation of the U.S. plans' master trust from a previous target of 30% equity and 70% fixed income to 10% equity and 90% fixed income in an effort to better protect the funded status of the U.S. plans' master trust. Asset reallocation will continue over a multi-year period based on the funded status, as defined by the Pension Protection Act of 2006 ("the Pension Act Funded Status"), of the U.S. plans' master trust and market conditions. We expect to reach our target allocation when the Pension Act Funded Status exceeds 100%. Based on the Pension Act Funded Status as of September 27, 2013, our target asset allocation is 45% equity and 55% fixed income. Acquisitions We account for acquired businesses using the acquisition method of accounting. This method requires, among other things, that most assets acquired and liabilities assumed be recognized at fair value as of the acquisition date. We allocate the purchase price of acquired businesses to the tangible and intangible assets acquired and liabilities assumed based on the estimated fair values, or as required by ASC 805, Business Combinations . The excess of the purchase price over the identifiable assets acquired and liabilities assumed is recorded as goodwill. We may engage independent third-party appraisal firms to assist us in determining the fair values of assets acquired and liabilities assumed. Such valuations require management to make significant estimates and assumptions, especially with respect to intangible assets. Critical estimates in valuing certain intangible assets include but are not limited to: future expected cash flows from customer and distributor relationships, acquired developed technologies, and patents; expected costs to develop in-process research and development into commercially viable products and estimated cash flows from projects when completed; brand awareness and market position, as well as assumptions about the period of time the brand will continue to be used in our product portfolio; customer and distributor attrition rates; royalty rates; and discount rates. Management's estimates of fair value are based upon assumptions believed to be reasonable, but which are inherently uncertain and unpredictable. As a result, actual results may differ from estimates. 60 Table of Contents Contingent Liabilities We record a loss contingency when the available information indicates it is probable that we have incurred a liability and the amount of the loss is reasonably estimable. When a range of possible losses with equal likelihood exists, we record the low end of the range. The likelihood of a loss with respect to a particular contingency is often difficult to predict, and determining a meaningful estimate of the loss or a range of loss may not be practicable based on information available. In addition, it is not uncommon for such matters to be resolved over many years, during which time relevant developments and new information must continuously be evaluated to determine whether a loss is probable and a reasonable estimate of that loss can be made. When a loss is probable but a reasonable estimate cannot be made, or when a loss is at least reasonably possible, disclosure is provided. Non-GAAP Financial Measures Organic Net Sales Growth Organic net sales growth is a non-GAAP financial measure. The difference between reported net sales growth (the most comparable GAAP measure) and organic net sales growth (the non-GAAP measure) consists of the impact from foreign currency exchange rates, acquisitions, divestitures, and an additional week in the fourth quarter of the fiscal year for fiscal years which are 53 weeks in length. Organic net sales growth is a useful measure of the underlying results and trends in our business. It excludes items that are not completely under management's control, such as the impact of changes in foreign currency exchange rates, and items that do not reflect the underlying growth of the company, such as acquisition and divestiture activity and the impact of an additional week in the fourth quarter of the fiscal year for fiscal years which are 53 weeks in length. The impact of the 53 rd week was estimated using an average weekly sales figure for the last month of the fiscal year. We believe organic net sales growth provides useful information to investors because it reflects the underlying growth from the ongoing activities of our business. Furthermore, it provides investors with a view of our operations from management's perspective. We use organic net sales growth to monitor and evaluate performance, as it is an important measure of the underlying results of our operations. Management uses organic net sales growth together with GAAP measures such as net sales growth and operating income in its decision making processes related to the operations of our reporting segments and our overall company. We believe that investors benefit from having access to the same financial measures that management uses in evaluating operations. The discussion and analysis of organic net sales growth in "Results of Operations" above utilizes organic net sales growth as management does internally. Because organic net sales growth calculations may vary among other companies, organic net sales growth amounts presented above may not be comparable with similarly titled measures of other companies. Organic net sales growth is a non-GAAP financial measure that is not meant to be considered in isolation or as a substitute for GAAP measures. The primary limitation of this measure is that it excludes items that have an impact on our net sales. This limitation is best addressed by evaluating organic net sales growth in combination with our GAAP net sales. The tables presented in "Results of Operations" above provide reconciliations of organic net sales growth to net sales growth calculated under GAAP. Free Cash Flow Free cash flow is a non-GAAP financial measure. The difference between net cash provided by continuing operating activities (the most comparable GAAP measure) and free cash flow (the non-GAAP measure) consists mainly of significant cash outflows and inflows that we believe are useful to identify. Free cash flow is a useful measure of our ability to generate cash. It also is a significant component in our incentive compensation plans. We believe free cash flow provides useful information 61 Table of Contents to investors as it provides insight into the primary cash flow metric used by management to monitor and evaluate cash flows generated from our operations. Free cash flow is defined as net cash provided by continuing operating activities excluding voluntary pension contributions and the cash impact of special items, minus net capital expenditures. Net capital expenditures consist of capital expenditures less proceeds from the sale of property, plant, and equipment. They are subtracted because they represent long-term commitments. Voluntary pension contributions are excluded from the GAAP measure because this activity is driven by economic financing decisions rather than operating activity. Certain special items, including net payments related to pre-separation tax matters, also are considered by management in evaluating free cash flow. We believe investors should also consider these items in evaluating our free cash flow. Free cash flow as presented herein may not be comparable to similarly-titled measures reported by other companies. The primary limitation of this measure is that it excludes items that have an impact on our GAAP cash flow. Also, it subtracts certain cash items that are ultimately within management's and the board of directors' discretion to direct and may imply that there is less or more cash available for our programs than the most comparable GAAP measure indicates. This limitation is best addressed by using free cash flow in combination with the GAAP cash flow results. It should not be inferred that the entire free cash flow amount is available for future discretionary expenditures, as our definition of free cash flow does not consider certain non-discretionary expenditures, such as debt payments. In addition, we may have other discretionary expenditures, such as discretionary dividends, share repurchases, and business acquisitions, that are not considered in the calculation of free cash flow. The tables presented in "Liquidity and Capital Resources" above provide reconciliations of free cash flow to cash flows from continuing operating activities calculated under GAAP.
