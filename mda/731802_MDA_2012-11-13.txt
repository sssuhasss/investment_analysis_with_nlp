ITEM 7. Management Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations. INTRODUCTION This section provides management discussion of the financial condition, changes in financial condition and results of operations of Atmos Energy Corporation and its consolidated subsidiaries with specific information on results of operations and liquidity and capital resources. It includes management interpretation of our financial results, the factors affecting these results, the major factors expected to affect future operating results and future investment and financing plans. This discussion should be read in conjunction with our consolidated financial statements and notes thereto. Several factors exist that could influence our future financial performance, some of which are described in Item 1A above, Risk Factors . They should be considered in connection with evaluating forward-looking statements contained in this report or otherwise made by or on behalf of us since these factors could cause actual results and conditions to differ materially from those set out in such forward-looking statements. Cautionary Statement for the Purposes of the Safe Harbor under the Private Securities Litigation Reform Act of 1995 The statements contained in this Annual Report on Form 10-K may contain forward-looking statements within the meaning of Section 27A of the Securities Act of 1933 and Section 21E of the Securities Exchange Act of 1934. All statements other than statements of historical fact included in this Report are forward-looking statements made in good faith by us and are intended to qualify for the safe harbor from liability established by the Private Securities Litigation Reform Act of 1995. When used in this Report, or any other of our documents or oral presentations, the words anticipate , believe , estimate , expect , forecast , goal , intend , objective , plan , projection , seek , strategy or similar words are intended to identify forward-looking statements. Such forward-looking statements are subject to risks and uncertainties that could cause actual results to differ materially from those expressed or implied in the statements relating to our strategy, operations, markets, services, rates, recovery of costs, availability of gas supply and other factors. These risks and uncertainties include the following: our ability to continue to access the credit markets to satisfy our liquidity requirements; the impact of adverse economic conditions on our customers; increased costs of providing pension and postretirement health care benefits and increased funding requirements along with increased costs of health care benefits; market risks beyond our control affecting our risk management activities including market liquidity, commodity price volatility, increasing interest rates and counterparty creditworthiness; regulatory trends and decisions, including the impact of rate proceedings before various state regulatory commissions; possible increased federal, state and local regulation of the safety of our operations; increased federal regulatory oversight and potential penalties; the impact of environmental regulations on our business; the impact of possible future additional regulatory and financial risks associated with global warming and climate change on our business; the concentration of our distribution, pipeline and storage operations in Texas; adverse weather conditions; the effects of inflation and changes in the availability and price of natural gas; the capital-intensive nature of our gas distribution business; increased competition from energy suppliers and alternative forms of energy; the threat of cyber-attacks or acts of cyber-terrorism that could disrupt our business operations and information technology systems; the inherent hazards and risks involved in operating our gas distribution business, natural disasters, terrorist activities or other events and other risks and uncertainties discussed herein, all of which are difficult to predict and many of which are beyond our control. Accordingly, while we believe these forward-looking statements to be reasonable, there can be no assurance that they will approximate actual experience or that the expectations derived from them will be realized. Further, we undertake no obligation to update or revise any of our forward-looking statements whether as a result of new information, future events or otherwise. CRITICAL ACCOUNTING POLICIES Our consolidated financial statements were prepared in accordance with accounting principles generally accepted in the United States. Preparation of these financial statements requires us to make estimates and judgments that affect the reported amounts of assets, liabilities, revenues and expenses and the related disclosures of contingent assets and liabilities. We base our estimates on historical experience and various other assumptions that we believe to be reasonable under the circumstances. Actual results may differ from estimates. 28 Table of Contents Our significant accounting policies are discussed in Note 2 to our consolidated financial statements. The accounting policies discussed below are both important to the presentation of our financial condition and results of operations and require management to make difficult, subjective or complex accounting estimates. Accordingly, these critical accounting policies are reviewed periodically by the Audit Committee of the Board of Directors. Regulation Our natural gas distribution and regulated transmission and storage operations are subject to regulation with respect to rates, service, maintenance of accounting records and various other matters by the respective regulatory authorities in the states in which we operate. We meet the criteria established within accounting principles generally accepted in the United States of a cost-based, rate-regulated entity, which requires us to reflect the financial effects of the ratemaking and accounting practices and policies of the various regulatory commissions in our financial statements in accordance with applicable authoritative accounting standards. We apply the provisions of this standard to our regulated operations and record regulatory assets for costs that have been deferred for which future recovery through customer rates is considered probable and regulatory liabilities when it is probable that revenues will be reduced for amounts that will be credited to customers through the ratemaking process. As a result, certain costs that would normally be expensed under accounting principles generally accepted in the United States are permitted to be capitalized or deferred on the balance sheet because it is probable they can be recovered through rates. Discontinuing the application of this method of accounting for regulatory assets and liabilities could significantly increase our operating expenses as fewer costs would likely be capitalized or deferred on the balance sheet, which could reduce our net income. Further, regulation may impact the period in which revenues or expenses are recognized. The amounts to be recovered or recognized are based upon historical experience and our understanding of the regulations. The impact of regulation on our regulated operations may be affected by decisions of the regulatory authorities or the issuance of new regulations. Unbilled Revenue Sales of natural gas to our natural gas distribution customers are billed on a monthly basis; however, the billing cycle periods for certain classes of customers do not necessarily coincide with accounting periods used for financial reporting purposes. We follow the revenue accrual method of accounting for natural gas distribution segment revenues whereby revenues applicable to gas delivered to customers, but not yet billed under the cycle billing method, are estimated and accrued and the related costs are charged to expense. On occasion, we are permitted to implement new rates that have not been formally approved by our regulatory authorities, which are subject to refund. We recognize this revenue and establish a reserve for amounts that could be refunded based on our experience for the jurisdiction in which the rates were implemented. Financial instruments and hedging activities We use financial instruments to mitigate commodity price risk and interest rate risk. The objectives for using financial instruments have been tailored to meet the needs of our regulated and nonregulated businesses. These objectives are more fully described in Note 4 to the consolidated financial statements. We record all of our financial instruments on the balance sheet at fair value as required by accounting principles generally accepted in the United States , with changes in fair value ultimately recorded in the income statement. Market value changes result in a change in the fair value of these financial instruments. The recognition of the changes in fair value of these financial instruments are recorded in the income statement is contingent upon whether the financial instrument has been designated and qualifies as a part of a hedging relationship or if regulatory rulings require a different accounting treatment. We have elected to treat forward gas supply contracts used in our regulated operations to deliver gas as normal purchases and normal sales. Financial instruments used to manage commodity price risk in our natural gas distribution segment do not impact this segment results of operations as the realized gains and losses are ultimately recovered from ratepayers through our rates. Our nonregulated segment also utilizes financial instruments to manage commodity price risk. We have designated the natural gas inventory held by this operating segment as the hedged item in a fair-value hedge. The financial instruments associated with this natural gas inventory have been designated as fair-value hedges. Changes in the fair value of the inventory and designated hedges are recognized in purchased gas cost in the period of change. 29 Table of Contents Additionally, we have elected to treat fixed-price forward contracts used in our nonregulated segment to deliver gas as normal purchases and normal sales. Financial instruments used to mitigate the commodity price risk associated with these contracts have been designated as cash flow hedges of anticipated purchases and sales at indexed prices. Accordingly, unrealized gains and losses on open financial instruments are recorded as a component of accumulated other comprehensive income (loss) and are recognized as a component of revenue when the hedged volumes are sold. Our nonregulated segment also uses storage swaps and futures that have not been designated as hedges. Accordingly, changes in the fair value of the inventory and designated hedges are recognized in revenue in the period of change. Finally, financial instruments used to mitigate interest rate risk are designated as cash flow hedges. Accordingly, unrealized gains and losses are recorded as a component of accumulated other comprehensive income (loss) and are recognized as a component of interest expense over the life of the related financing arrangement. The criteria used to determine if a financial instrument meets the definition of a derivative and qualifies for hedge accounting treatment are complex and require management to exercise professional judgment. Further, as more fully discussed below, significant changes in the fair value of these financial instruments could materially impact our financial position, results of operations or cash flows. Fair Value Measurements We report certain assets and liabilities at fair value, which is defined as the price that would be received to sell an asset or paid to transfer a liability in an orderly transaction between market participants at the measurement date (exit price). Prices actively quoted on national exchanges are used to determine the fair value of most of our assets and liabilities recorded on our balance sheet at fair value. Within our nonregulated operations, we utilize a mid-market pricing convention (the mid-point between the bid and ask prices) for determining fair value measurement, as permitted under current accounting standards. Values derived from these sources reflect the market in which transactions involving these financial instruments are executed. We utilize models and other valuation methods to determine fair value when external sources are not available. Values are adjusted to reflect the potential impact of an orderly liquidation of our positions over a reasonable period of time under then-current market conditions. Fair-value estimates also consider our own creditworthiness and the creditworthiness of the counterparties involved. Our counterparties consist primarily of financial institutions and major energy companies. This concentration of counterparties may materially impact our exposure to credit risk resulting from market, economic or regulatory conditions. We seek to minimize counterparty credit risk through an evaluation of their financial condition and credit ratings and the use of collateral requirements under certain circumstances. The fair value of our financial instruments is subject to potentially significant volatility based numerous considerations including, but not limited to changes in commodity prices, interest rates, maturity and settlement of these financial instruments, and our creditworthiness as well as the creditworthiness of our counterparties. We believe the market prices and models used to value these financial instruments represent the best information available with respect to closing exchange and over-the-counter quotations, time value and volatility factors underlying the contracts. Impairment assessments We review the carrying value of our long-lived assets, including goodwill and identifiable intangibles, whenever events or changes in circumstance indicate that such carrying values may not be recoverable, and at least annually for goodwill, as required by US accounting standards. The evaluation of our goodwill balances and other long-lived assets or identifiable assets for which uncertainty exists regarding the recoverability of the carrying value of such assets involves the assessment of future cash flows and external market conditions and other subjective factors that could impact the estimation of future cash flows including, but not limited to the commodity prices, the amount and timing of future cash flows, future growth rates and the discount rate. Unforeseen events and changes in circumstances or market conditions could adversely affects these estimates, which could result in an impairment charge. 30 Table of Contents Pension and other postretirement plans Pension and other postretirement plan costs and liabilities are determined on an actuarial basis using a September 30 measurement date and are affected by numerous assumptions and estimates including the market value of plan assets, estimates of the expected return on plan assets, assumed discount rates and current demographic and actuarial mortality data. The assumed discount rate and the expected return are the assumptions that generally have the most significant impact on our pension costs and liabilities. The assumed discount rate, the assumed health care cost trend rate and assumed rates of retirement generally have the most significant impact on our postretirement plan costs and liabilities. The discount rate is utilized principally in calculating the actuarial present value of our pension and postretirement obligations and net periodic pension and postretirement benefit plan costs. When establishing our discount rate, we consider high quality corporate bond rates based on bonds available in the marketplace that are suitable for settling the obligations, changes in those rates from the prior year and the implied discount rate that is derived from matching our projected benefit disbursements with currently available high quality corporate bonds. The expected long-term rate of return on assets is utilized in calculating the expected return on plan assets component of our annual pension and postretirement plan costs. We estimate the expected return on plan assets by evaluating expected bond returns, equity risk premiums, asset allocations, the effects of active plan management, the impact of periodic plan asset rebalancing and historical performance. We also consider the guidance from our investment advisors in making a final determination of our expected rate of return on assets. To the extent the actual rate of return on assets realized over the course of a year is greater than or less than the assumed rate, that year annual pension or postretirement plan costs are not affected. Rather, this gain or loss reduces or increases future pension or postretirement plan costs over a period of approximately ten to twelve years. The market-related value of our plan assets represents the fair market value of the plan assets, adjusted to smooth out short-term market fluctuations over a five-year period. The use of this calculation will delay the impact of current market fluctuations on the pension expense for the period. We estimate the assumed health care cost trend rate used in determining our postretirement net expense based upon our actual health care cost experience, the effects of recently enacted legislation and general economic conditions. Our assumed rate of retirement is estimated based upon our annual review of our participant census information as of the measurement date. Actual changes in the fair market value of plan assets and differences between the actual and expected return on plan assets could have a material effect on the amount of pension costs ultimately recognized. A 0.25 percent change in our discount rate would impact our pension and postretirement costs by approximately $2.3 million. A 0.25 percent change in our expected rate of return would impact our pension and postretirement costs by approximately $0.8 million. Contingencies In the normal course of business, we are confronted with issues or events that may result in a contingent liability. These generally relate to lawsuits, claims made by third parties or the action of various regulatory agencies. For such matters, we record liabilities when they are considered probable and reasonably estimable, based on currently available facts and our estimates of the ultimate outcome or resolution of the liability in the future. Actual results may differ from estimates, depending on actual outcomes or changes in the facts or expectations surrounding each potential exposure. Changes in the estimates related to contingencies could have a negative impact on our consolidated results of operations, cash flows or financial position. Our contingencies are further discussed in Note 13 to our consolidated financial statements. RESULTS OF OPERATIONS Overview Atmos Energy Corporation is involved in the distribution, marketing and transportation of natural gas. Accordingly, our results of operations are impacted by the demand for natural gas, particularly during the winter heating season, and the volatility of the natural gas markets. This generally results in higher operating revenues and net income during the period from October through March of each fiscal year and lower operating revenues and either lower net income or net losses during the period from April through September of each fiscal year. As 31 Table of Contents a result of the seasonality of the natural gas industry, our second fiscal quarter has historically been our most critical earnings quarter with an average of approximately 56 percent of our consolidated net income having been earned in the second quarter during the three most recently completed fiscal years. Additionally, the seasonality of our business impacts our working capital differently at various times during the year. Typically, our accounts receivable, accounts payable and short-term debt balances peak by the end of January and then start to decline, as customers begin to pay their winter heating bills. Gas stored underground, particularly in our natural gas distribution segment, typically peaks in November and declines as we utilize storage gas to serve our customers. During fiscal 2012, we earned $216.7 million, or $2.37 per diluted share, which represents a four percent increase in net income and diluted net income per share over fiscal 2011. During fiscal 2012, recent improvements in rate designs in our natural gas distribution and regulated transmission and storage segments offset an eight percent year-over-year decline in consolidated natural gas distribution throughput due to warmer weather and a 21 percent decrease in nonregulated delivered gas sales due to a nine percent decrease in consolidated sales volumes as a result of warmer weather and a decrease in per-unit margins. Additionally, results for fiscal 2012 were influenced by several non-recurring items, which increased diluted earnings per share by $0.11. On August 1, 2012, we completed the sale of substantially all of our natural gas distribution assets located in Missouri, Illinois and Iowa to Liberty Energy (Midstates) Corp., an affiliate of Algonquin Power & Utilities Corp. for a cash price of approximately $128 million, pursuant to an asset purchase agreement executed on May 12, 2011. In connection with the sale, we recognized a net of tax gain of approximately $6.3 million. On August 8, 2012, we entered into an asset purchase agreement to sell all of our natural gas distribution assets located in Georgia to Liberty Energy (Georgia) Corp., an affiliate of Algonquin Power & Utilities Corp. for a cash price of approximately $141 million. The agreement contains terms and conditions customary for transactions of this type, including typical adjustments to the purchase price at closing, if applicable. The closing of the transaction is subject to the satisfaction of customary conditions including the receipt of applicable regulatory approvals. Due to the pending sales transaction, the results of operations for our Georgia service area are shown in discontinued operations. Our Unsecured 5.125% Senior Notes were scheduled to mature in January 2013. On July 27, 2012 we issued a notice of early redemption of these notes on August 28, 2012. We initially funded the redemption through the issuance of commercial paper. On September 27, 2012, we entered into a $260 million short-term financing facility to repay the commercial paper borrowings utilized to redeem the notes. The facility bears interest at a one-month LIBOR based rate plus currently a margin of 0.875% which is based on the Company credit rating. The short-term facility is expected to be repaid with the proceeds received from the issuance of new $350 million senior unsecured notes anticipated to occur in January 2013. In connection with the redemption, we paid a make-whole premium in accordance with the terms of the indenture and the Senior Notes and accrued interest at the time of redemption. In accordance with regulatory requirements, the premium will be deferred and will be recognized over the life of the new unsecured notes expected to be issued in January 2013. 32 Table of Contents Consolidated Results The following table presents our consolidated financial highlights for the fiscal years ended September 30, 2012, 2011 and 2010. For the Fiscal Year Ended September 30 2012 2011 2010 (In thousands, except per share data) Operating revenues $ 3,438,483 $ 4,286,435 $ 4,661,060 Gross profit 1,323,739 1,300,820 1,314,136 Operating expenses 877,499 874,834 850,303 Operating income 446,240 425,986 463,833 Miscellaneous income (expense) (14,644 ) 21,184 (591 ) Interest charges 141,174 150,763 154,188 Income from continuing operations before income taxes 290,422 296,407 309,054 Income tax expense 98,226 106,819 119,203 Income from continuing operations 192,196 189,588 189,851 Income from discontinued operations, net of tax 18,172 18,013 15,988 Gain on sale of discontinued operations, net of tax 6,349 Net income $ 216,717 $ 207,601 $ 205,839 Diluted net income per share from continuing operations $ 2.10 $ 2.07 $ 2.03 Diluted net income per share from discontinued operations $ 0.27 $ 0.20 $ 0.17 Diluted net income per share $ 2.37 $ 2.27 $ 2.20 Regulated operations contributed 98 percent, 104 percent and 81 percent to our consolidated net income for fiscal years 2012, 2011 and 2010. Our consolidated net income during the last three fiscal years was earned across our business segments as follows: For the Fiscal Year Ended September 30 2012 2011 2010 (In thousands) Natural gas distribution segment $ 148,369 $ 162,718 $ 125,949 Regulated transmission and storage segment 63,059 52,415 41,486 Nonregulated segment 5,289 (7,532 ) 38,404 Net income $ 216,717 $ 207,601 $ 205,839 The following table segregates our consolidated net income and diluted earnings per share between our regulated and nonregulated operations: For the Fiscal Year Ended September 30 2012 2011 2010 (In thousands, except per share data) Regulated operations $ 211,428 $ 215,133 $ 167,435 Nonregulated operations 5,289 (7,532 ) 38,404 Consolidated net income $ 216,717 $ 207,601 $ 205,839 Diluted EPS from regulated operations $ 2.31 $ 2.35 $ 1.79 Diluted EPS from nonregulated operations 0.06 (0.08 ) 0.41 Consolidated diluted EPS $ 2.37 $ 2.27 $ 2.20 We reported net income of $216.7 million, or $2.37 per diluted share for the year ended September 30, 2012, compared with net income of $207.6 million or $2.27 per diluted share in the prior year. Income from continuing operations was $192.2 million, or $2.10 per diluted share compared with $189.6 million, or $2.07 per diluted share in the prior-year period. Income from discontinued operations was $24.5 million or $0.27 per diluted share for the year, which includes the gain on sale of substantially all our assets in Missouri, Illinois and 33 Table of Contents Iowa of $6.3 million, compared with $18.0 million or $0.20 per diluted share in the prior year. Unrealized losses in our nonregulated operations during the current year reduced net income by $5.0 million or $0.05 per diluted share compared with net losses recorded in the prior year of $6.6 million, or $0.07 per diluted share. Additionally, net income in both periods was impacted by nonrecurring items. In fiscal 2011, net income included the net positive impact of several one-time items totaling $3.2 million, or $0.03 per diluted share related to the pre-tax items, which are discussed in further detail below. In fiscal 2012, net income includes the net positive impact of several one-time items totaling $10.3 million, or $0.11 per diluted share related to the following amounts: $13.6 million positive impact of a deferred tax rate adjustment. $10.0 million ($6.3 million, net of tax) unfavorable impact related to a one-time donation to a donor advised fund. $9.9 million ($6.3 million, net of tax) favorable impact related to the cash gain recorded in association with the August 1, 2012 completion of the sale of our Iowa, Illinois and Missouri assets. $5.3 million ($3.3 million, net of tax) unfavorable impact related to the noncash impairment of certain assets in our nonregulated business. We reported net income of $207.6 million, or $2.27 per diluted share for the year ended September 30, 2011, compared with net income of $205.8 million or $2.20 per diluted share in the prior year. Income from continuing operations was $189.6 million, or $2.07 per diluted share compared with $189.9 million, or $2.03 per diluted share in the prior-year period. Income from discontinued operations was $18.0 million or $0.20 per diluted share for the year, compared with $16.0 million or $0.17 per diluted share in the prior year. Unrealized losses in our nonregulated operations during fiscal 2011 reduced net income by $6.6 million or $0.07 per diluted share compared with net losses recorded in fiscal 2010 of $4.3 million, or $0.05 per diluted share. Additionally, net income in both periods was impacted by nonrecurring items. In fiscal 2010, net income included the net positive impact of a state sales tax refund of $4.6 million, or $0.05 per diluted share. In fiscal 2011, net income includes the net positive impact of several one-time items totaling $3.2 million, or $0.03 per diluted share related to the following pre-tax amounts: $27.8 million favorable impact related to the cash gain recorded in association with the unwinding of two Treasury locks in conjunction with the cancellation of a planned debt offering in November 2011. $30.3 million unfavorable impact related to the noncash impairment of certain assets in our nonregulated business. $5.0 million favorable impact related to the administrative settlement of various income tax positions. See the following discussion regarding the results of operations for each of our business operating segments. Natural Gas Distribution Segment The primary factors that impact the results of our natural gas distribution operations are our ability to earn our authorized rates of return, the cost of natural gas, competitive factors in the energy industry and economic conditions in our service areas. Our ability to earn our authorized rates is based primarily on our ability to improve the rate design in our various ratemaking jurisdictions by reducing or eliminating regulatory lag and, ultimately, separating the recovery of our approved margins from customer usage patterns. Improving rate design is a long-term process and is further complicated by the fact that we operate in multiple rate jurisdictions. The Ratemaking Activity section of this Form 10-K describes our current rate strategy, progress towards implementing that strategy and recent ratemaking initiatives in more detail. We are generally able to pass the cost of gas through to our customers without markup under purchased gas cost adjustment mechanisms; therefore the cost of gas typically does not have an impact on our gross profit as increases in the cost of gas are offset by a corresponding increase in revenues. Accordingly, we believe gross profit is a better indicator of our financial performance than revenues. However, gross profit in our Texas and Mississippi service areas include franchise fees and gross receipts taxes, which are calculated as a percentage of revenue (inclusive of gas costs). Therefore, the amount of these taxes included in revenues is influenced by the 34 Table of Contents cost of gas and the level of gas sales volumes. We record the tax expense as a component of taxes, other than income. Although changes in revenue-related taxes arising from changes in gas costs affect gross profit, over time the impact is offset within operating income. As discussed above, the cost of gas typically does not have a direct impact on our gross profit. However, higher gas costs may adversely impact our accounts receivable collections, resulting in higher bad debt expense, and may require us to increase borrowings under our credit facilities resulting in higher interest expense. In addition, higher gas costs, as well as competitive factors in the industry and general economic conditions may cause customers to conserve or, in the case of industrial consumers, to use alternative energy sources. However, gas cost risk has been mitigated in recent years through improvements in rate design that allow us to collect from our customers the gas cost portion of our bad debt expense on approximately 75 percent of our residential and commercial margins. As discussed above, on August 1, 2012, we completed the sale of substantially all of our natural gas distribution operations in Missouri, Illinois and Iowa. On August 8, 2012 we entered into a definitive agreement to sell our natural gas distribution operations in Georgia. The results of these operations have been separately reported in the following tables and exclude general corporate overhead and interest expense that would normally be allocated to these operations. Review of Financial and Operating Results Financial and operational highlights for our natural gas distribution segment for the fiscal years ended September 30, 2012, 2011 and 2010 are presented below. For the Fiscal Year Ended September 30 2012 2011 2010 2012 vs. 2011 2011 vs. 2010 (In thousands, unless otherwise noted) Gross profit $ 1,022,743 $ 1,017,943 $ 998,642 $ 4,800 $ 19,301 Operating expenses 718,282 695,855 701,791 22,427 (5,936 ) Operating income 304,461 322,088 296,851 (17,627 ) 25,237 Miscellaneous income (expense) (12,657 ) 16,242 1,132 (28,899 ) 15,110 Interest charges 110,642 115,740 118,147 (5,098 ) (2,407 ) Income from continuing operations before income taxes 181,162 222,590 179,836 (41,428 ) 42,754 Income tax expense 57,314 77,885 69,875 (20,571 ) 8,010 Income from continuing operations 123,848 144,705 109,961 (20,857 ) 34,744 Income from discontinued operations, net of tax 18,172 18,013 15,988 159 2,025 Gain on sale of discontinued operations, net of tax 6,349 6,349 Net Income $ 148,369 $ 162,718 $ 125,949 $ (14,349 ) $ 36,769 Consolidated natural gas distribution sales volumes from continuing operations MMcf 244,466 275,540 307,474 (31,074 ) (31,934 ) Consolidated natural gas distribution transportation volumes from continuing operations MMcf 128,222 125,812 122,633 2,410 3,179 Consolidated natural gas distribution throughput from continuing operations MMcf 372,688 401,352 430,107 (28,664 ) (28,755 ) Consolidated natural gas distribution throughput from discontinued operations MMcf 18,295 22,668 24,068 (4,373 ) (1,400 ) Total consolidated natural gas distribution throughput MMcf 390,983 424,020 454,175 (33,037 ) (30,155 ) Consolidated natural gas distribution average transportation revenue per Mcf $ 0.43 $ 0.47 $ 0.47 $ (0.04 ) $ Consolidated natural gas distribution average cost of gas per Mcf sold $ 4.64 $ 5.30 $ 5.77 $ (0.66 ) $ (0.47 ) 35 Table of Contents Fiscal year ended September 30, 2012 compared with fiscal year ended September 30, 2011 The $4.8 million increase in natural gas distribution gross profit was primarily due to a $17.7 million net increase in rate adjustments, primarily in the Mid-Tex, Louisiana, Mississippi, West Texas and Kentucky service areas. These increases were partially offset by the following: $11.1 million decrease in revenue-related taxes in our Mid-Tex, West Texas and Mississippi service areas, primarily due to lower revenues on which the tax is calculated. $1.6 million decrease due to an eight percent decrease in consolidated throughput caused principally by lower residential and commercial consumption combined with warmer weather in the current year compared to last year in most of our service areas. Operating expenses, which include operation and maintenance expense, provision for doubtful accounts, depreciation and amortization expense and taxes, other than income increased $22.4 million primarily due to the following: $11.2 million increase in legal costs, primarily due to settlements. $10.6 million increase in employee-related costs. $8.4 million increase in depreciation and amortization associated with an increase in our net plant as a result of our capital investments in the prior year. $2.6 million increase in software maintenance costs. These increases were partially offset by the following: $6.8 million decrease in operating expenses due to increased capital spending and warmer weather allowing us time to complete more capital work than in the prior year. $2.9 million decrease due to the establishment of regulatory assets for pension and postretirement costs. Miscellaneous income decreased $28.9 million primarily due to the absence of a $21.8 million pre-tax gain recognized in the prior year as a result of unwinding two Treasury locks ($13.6 million, net of tax) and a $10.0 million one-time donation to a donor advised fund in the current year. Interest charges decreased $5.1 million compared to the prior year due primarily to the prepayment of our 5.125% $250 million senior notes in the fourth quarter of fiscal 2012, refinancing long-term debt at reduced interest rates and reducing commitment fees from decreasing the number of credit facilities and extending the length of their terms in fiscal 2011. Additionally, results for fiscal 2012 were favorably impacted by a state tax benefit of $11.3 million. Due to the completion of the sale of our Missouri, Iowa and Illinois service areas in the fiscal fourth quarter, the Company updated its analysis of the tax rate at which deferred taxes would reverse in the future to reflect the sale of these service areas. The updated analysis supported a reduction in the deferred tax rate which when applied to the balance of taxable income deferred to future periods resulted in a reduction of the Company overall deferred tax liability. Fiscal year ended September 30, 2011 compared with fiscal year ended September 30, 2010 The $19.3 million increase in natural gas distribution gross profit primarily reflects a $38.6 million net increase in rate adjustments, primarily in the Mid-Tex, Louisiana, Kentucky and Kansas service areas. These increases were partially offset by: $12.9 million decrease due to a seven percent decrease in consolidated throughput caused principally by lower residential and commercial consumption combined with warmer weather in fiscal 2011 compared to the same period in fiscal 2010 in most of our service areas. $8.1 million decrease in revenue-related taxes, primarily due to lower revenues on which the tax is calculated. 36 Table of Contents Operating expenses, which include operation and maintenance expense, provision for doubtful accounts, depreciation and amortization expense and taxes, other than income decreased $5.9 million, primarily due to the following: $10.0 million decrease in taxes, other than income, due to lower revenue-related taxes. $6.4 million decrease in employee-related expenses. These decreases were partially offset by: $5.4 million increase due to the absence of a state sales tax reimbursement received in fiscal 2010. $11.5 million increase in depreciation and amortization expense. $1.7 million increase in vehicles and equipment expense. Net income for this segment for fiscal 2011 was also favorably impacted by a $21.8 million pre-tax gain recognized in March 2011 as a result of unwinding two Treasury locks and a $5.0 million income tax benefit related to the administrative settlement of various income tax positions. The following table shows our operating income from continuing operations by natural gas distribution division, in order of total rate base, for the fiscal years ended September 30, 2012, 2011 and 2010. The presentation of our natural gas distribution operating income is included for financial reporting purposes and may not be appropriate for ratemaking purposes. For the Fiscal Year Ended September 30 2012 2011 2010 2012 vs. 2011 2011 vs. 2010 (In thousands) Mid-Tex $ 142,755 $ 144,204 $ 134,655 $ (1,449 ) $ 9,549 Kentucky/Mid-States 32,185 37,593 32,920 (5,408 ) 4,673 Louisiana 48,958 50,442 45,759 (1,484 ) 4,683 West Texas 27,875 29,686 33,509 (1,811 ) (3,823 ) Mississippi 27,369 26,338 26,441 1,031 (103 ) Colorado-Kansas 23,898 25,920 24,543 (2,022 ) 1,377 Other 1,421 7,905 (976 ) (6,484 ) 8,881 Total $ 304,461 $ 322,088 $ 296,851 $ (17,627 ) $ 25,237 Regulated Transmission and Storage Segment Our regulated transmission and storage segment consists of the regulated pipeline and storage operations of the Atmos Pipeline Texas Division. The Atmos Pipeline Texas Division transports natural gas to our Mid-Tex Division and third parties and manages five underground storage reservoirs in Texas. We also provide ancillary services customary in the pipeline industry including parking arrangements, lending and sales of excess gas. Our regulated transmission and storage segment is impacted by seasonal weather patterns, competitive factors in the energy industry and economic conditions in our Mid-Tex service area. Natural gas prices do not directly impact the results of this segment as revenues are derived from the transportation of natural gas. However, natural gas prices and demand for natural gas could influence the level of drilling activity in the markets that we serve, which may influence the level of throughput we may be able to transport on our pipeline. Further, natural gas price differences between the various hubs that we serve could influence customers to transport gas through our pipeline to capture arbitrage gains. The results of Atmos Pipeline Texas Division are also significantly impacted by the natural gas requirements of the Mid-Tex Division because it is the primary supplier of natural gas for our Mid-Tex Division. Finally, as a regulated pipeline, the operations of the Atmos Pipeline Texas Division may be impacted by the timing of when costs and expenses are incurred and when these costs and expenses are recovered through its tariffs. 37 Table of Contents Review of Financial and Operating Results Financial and operational highlights for our regulated transmission and storage segment for the fiscal years ended September 30, 2012, 2011 and 2010 are presented below. For the Fiscal Year Ended September 30 2012 2011 2010 2012 vs. 2011 2011 vs. 2010 (In thousands, unless otherwise noted) Mid-Tex Division transportation $ 162,808 $ 125,973 $ 102,891 $ 36,835 $ 23,082 Third-party transportation 64,158 73,676 73,648 (9,518 ) 28 Storage and park and lend services 6,764 7,995 10,657 (1,231 ) (2,662 ) Other 13,621 11,729 15,817 1,892 (4,088 ) Gross profit 247,351 219,373 203,013 27,978 16,360 Operating expenses 118,527 111,098 105,975 7,429 5,123 Operating income 128,824 108,275 97,038 20,549 11,237 Miscellaneous income (expense) (1,051 ) 4,715 135 (5,766 ) 4,580 Interest charges 29,414 31,432 31,174 (2,018 ) 258 Income before income taxes 98,359 81,558 65,999 16,801 15,559 Income tax expense 35,300 29,143 24,513 6,157 4,630 Net income $ 63,059 $ 52,415 $ 41,486 $ 10,644 $ 10,929 Gross pipeline transportation volumes MMcf 640,732 620,904 634,885 19,828 (13,981 ) Consolidated pipeline transportation volumes MMcf 466,527 435,012 428,599 31,515 6,413 Fiscal year ended September 30, 2012 compared with fiscal year ended September 30, 2011 The $28.0 million increase in regulated transmission and storage gross profit compared to the prior year was primarily a result of the rate case that was finalized and became effective in May 2011 as well as the GRIP filings approved by the Railroad Commission of Texas (RRC) during fiscal 2011 and 2012. In May 2011, the RRC issued an order in the rate case of Atmos Pipeline Texas that approved an annual operating income increase of $20.4 million. During fiscal 2011, the RRC approved the Atmos Pipeline Texas GRIP filing with an annual operating income increase of $12.6 million that went into effect in the fiscal fourth quarter. On April 10, 2012, the RRC approved the Atmos Pipeline Texas GRIP filing with an annual operating income increase of $14.7 million that went into effect with bills rendered on an after April 10, 2012. Operating expenses increased $7.4 million primarily due to a $5.4 million increase in depreciation expense, resulting from higher investment in net plant. Additionally, results for fiscal 2012 were favorably impacted by a state tax benefit of $2.3 million associated with an update of the estimated tax rate at which deferred taxes would reverse in future periods after the completion of the sale of our Missouri, Illinois and Iowa assets. Net income for this segment for the prior year was favorably impacted by a $6.0 million pre-tax gain recognized in March 2011 as a result of unwinding two Treasury locks ($3.9 million, net of tax). Fiscal year ended September 30, 2011 compared with fiscal year ended September 30, 2010 On April 18, 2011, the RRC issued an order in the rate case of Atmos Pipeline Texas (APT) that was originally filed in September 2010. The RRC approved an annual operating income increase of $20.4 million as well as the following major provisions that went into effect with bills rendered on and after May 1, 2011: Authorized return on equity of 11.8 percent. A capital structure of 49.5 percent debt/50.5 percent equity. 38 Table of Contents Approval of a rate base of $807.7 million, compared to the $417.1 million rate base from the prior rate case. An annual adjustment mechanism, which was approved for a three-year pilot program, that will adjust regulated rates up or down by 75 percent of the difference between APT non-regulated annual revenue and a pre-defined base credit. Approval of a straight fixed variable rate design, under which all fixed costs associated with transportation and storage services are recovered through monthly customer charges. The $16.4 million increase in regulated transmission and storage gross profit was attributable primarily to the following: $23.4 million net increase as a result of the rate case that was finalized and became effective in May 2011. $3.2 million increase associated with our most recent GRIP filing. These increases were partially offset by the following: $4.8 million decrease due to the absence of the sale of excess gas, which occurred in the prior year. $4.4 million decrease due to a decline in throughput to our Mid-Tex Division primarily due to warmer than normal weather during fiscal 2011. Operating expenses increased $5.1 million primarily due to the following: $4.6 million increase due to higher depreciation expense. $2.0 million increase due to the absence of a state sales tax reimbursement received in the prior year. These increases were partially offset by the following: $0.8 million decrease related to lower levels of pipeline maintenance activities. $0.7 million decrease due to lower employee-related expenses. Miscellaneous income includes a $6.0 million gain recognized in March 2011 as a result of unwinding two Treasury locks. Nonregulated Segment Our nonregulated activities are conducted through Atmos Energy Holdings, Inc. (AEH), which is a wholly-owned subsidiary of Atmos Energy Corporation and operates primarily in the Midwest and Southeast areas of the United States. AEH primary business is to deliver gas and provide related services by aggregating and purchasing gas supply, arranging transportation and storage logistics and ultimately delivering gas to customers at competitive prices. These activities are reflected as gas delivery and related services in the table below. AEH also earns storage and transportation margins from (i) utilizing its proprietary 21-mile pipeline located in New Orleans, Louisiana to aggregate gas supply for our regulated natural gas distribution division in Louisiana, its gas delivery activities and, on a more limited basis, for third parties and (ii) managing proprietary storage in Kentucky and Louisiana to supplement the natural gas needs of our natural gas distribution divisions during peak periods. Most of these margins are generated through demand fees established under contracts with certain of our natural gas distribution divisions that are renewed periodically and subject to regulatory oversight. These activities are reflected as storage and transportation services in the table below. AEH utilizes customer-owned or contracted storage capacity to serve its customers. In an effort to offset the demand fees paid to contract for storage capacity and to maximize the value of this capacity, AEH sells financial instruments in an effort to earn a gross profit margin through the arbitrage of pricing differences in various locations and by recognizing pricing differences that occur over time. Margins earned from these activities and the related storage demand fees are reported as asset optimization margins. Certain of these arrangements are with regulated affiliates, which have been approved by applicable state regulatory commissions. 39 Table of Contents Our nonregulated activities are significantly influenced by competitive factors in the industry and general economic conditions. Therefore, the margins earned from these activities are dependent upon our ability to attract and retain customers and to minimize the cost of gas and demand fees paid to contract for storage capacity to offer more competitive pricing to those customers. Further, natural gas market conditions, most notably the price of natural gas and the level of price volatility affect our nonregulated businesses. Natural gas prices and the level of volatility are influenced by a number of factors including, but not limited to, general economic conditions, the demand for natural gas in different parts of the country, the level of domestic natural gas production and the level of natural gas inventory levels. Natural gas prices can influence: The demand for natural gas. Higher prices may cause customers to conserve or use alternative energy sources. Conversely, lower prices could cause customers such as electric power generators to switch from alternative energy sources to natural gas. Collection of accounts receivable from customers, which could affect the level of bad debt expense recognized by this segment. The level of borrowings under our credit facilities, which affects the level of interest expense recognized by this segment. Natural gas price volatility can also influence our nonregulated business in the following ways: Price volatility influences basis differentials, which provide opportunities to profit from identifying the lowest cost alternative among the natural gas supplies, transportation and markets to which we have access. Price volatility also influences the spreads between the current (spot) prices and forward natural gas prices, which creates opportunities to earn higher arbitrage spreads. Increased volatility impacts the amounts of unrealized margins recorded in our gross profit and could impact the amount of cash required to collateralize our risk management liabilities. Our nonregulated segment manages its exposure to natural gas commodity price risk through a combination of physical storage and financial instruments. Therefore, results for this segment include unrealized gains or losses on its net physical gas position and the related financial instruments used to manage commodity price risk. These margins fluctuate based upon changes in the spreads between the physical and forward natural gas prices. Generally, if the physical/financial spread narrows, we will record unrealized gains or lower unrealized losses. If the physical/financial spread widens, we will generally record unrealized losses or lower unrealized gains. The magnitude of the unrealized gains and losses is also contingent upon the levels of our net physical position at the end of the reporting period. 40 Table of Contents Review of Financial and Operating Results Financial and operational highlights for our nonregulated segment for the fiscal years ended September 30, 2012, 2011 and 2010 are presented below. For the Fiscal Year Ended September 30 2012 2011 2010 2012 vs. 2011 2011 vs. 2010 (In thousands, unless otherwise noted) Realized margins Gas delivery and related services $ 46,578 $ 58,990 $ 59,523 $ (12,412 ) $ (533 ) Storage and transportation services 13,382 14,570 13,206 (1,188 ) 1,364 Other 3,737 5,265 5,347 (1,528 ) (82 ) 63,697 78,825 78,076 (15,128 ) 749 Asset optimization (1) (558 ) (3,424 ) 43,805 2,866 (47,229 ) Total realized margins 63,139 75,401 121,881 (12,262 ) (46,480 ) Unrealized margins (8,015 ) (10,401 ) (7,790 ) 2,386 (2,611 ) Gross profit 55,124 65,000 114,091 (9,876 ) (49,091 ) Operating expenses, excluding asset impairment 36,886 39,113 44,147 (2,227 ) (5,034 ) Asset impairment 5,288 30,270 (24,982 ) 30,270 Operating income (loss) 12,950 (4,383 ) 69,944 17,333 (74,327 ) Miscellaneous income 1,035 657 3,859 378 (3,202 ) Interest charges 3,084 4,015 10,584 (931 ) (6,569 ) Income (loss) before income taxes 10,901 (7,741 ) 63,219 18,642 (70,960 ) Income tax expense (benefit) 5,612 (209 ) 24,815 5,821 (25,024 ) Net income (loss) $ 5,289 $ (7,532 ) $ 38,404 $ 12,821 $ (45,936 ) Gross nonregulated delivered gas sales volumes MMcf 400,512 446,903 420,203 (46,391 ) 26,700 Consolidated nonregulated delivered gas sales volumes MMcf 351,628 384,799 353,853 (33,171 ) 30,946 Net physical position (Bcf) 18.8 21.0 15.7 (2.2 ) 5.3 (1) Net of storage fees of $18.4 million, $15.2 million and $13.2 million. Fiscal year ended September 30, 2012 compared with fiscal year ended September 30, 2011 Results for our nonregulated operations during fiscal 2012 were adversely influenced by continued unfavorable natural gas market conditions. Historically high natural gas storage levels from strong domestic natural gas production caused natural gas prices to remain relatively low during fiscal 2012. Additionally, we continued to experience compressed spot to forward spread values and basis differentials. We anticipate these natural gas market conditions will continue for the foreseeable future. As a result, we anticipate that basis differentials will remain compressed and spot-to-forward price volatility will remain relatively low. Accordingly, although we anticipate continuing to profit on a fiscal-year basis from our nonregulated activities, we anticipate per-unit margins from our delivered gas activities and margins earned from our asset optimization activities for the foreseeable future to be more consistent with the performance we have experienced during the last two fiscal years. 41 Table of Contents Realized margins for gas delivery, storage and transportation services and other services were $63.7 million during the year ended September 30, 2012 compared with $78.8 million for the prior year. The decrease reflects the following: A nine percent decrease in consolidated sales volumes. The decrease was largely attributable to warmer weather, which reduced sales to utility, municipal and other weather-sensitive customers. A $0.02/Mcf decrease in gas delivery per-unit margins compared to the prior year primarily due to lower basis differentials resulting from increased natural gas supply and increased transportation costs. Asset optimization margins increased $2.9 million from the prior year. The increase primarily reflects higher realized margins earned from the settlement of financial instruments used to hedge our natural gas inventory purchases, partially offset by increased storage fees associated with increased park and loan activity and a $1.7 million charge in the first fiscal quarter of the current year to write down to market certain natural gas inventory that no longer qualified for fair value hedge accounting. Unrealized margins increased $2.4 million in the current year compared to the prior year primarily due to the timing of year-over-year realized margins. Operating expenses, excluding asset impairments decreased $2.2 million primarily due to lower employee-related expenses. During the fourth quarter of fiscal 2012, we recorded a $5.3 million noncash charge to impair our natural gas gathering assets located in Kentucky. The charge reflected a reduction in the value of the project due to the current low natural gas price environment and management decision to focus AEH activities on its gas delivery, storage and transportation services. In the prior year, asset impairments included an asset impairment charge of $19.3 million related to our investment in our Fort Necessity storage project as well as an $11.0 million pre-tax impairment charge related to the write-off of certain natural gas gathering assets. Fiscal year ended September 30, 2011 compared with fiscal year ended September 30, 2010 Realized margins for gas delivery, storage and transportation services and other services were $78.8 million during the year ended September 30, 2011 compared with $78.1 million for the prior-year period. The increase primarily reflects the following: $1.4 million increase in margins from storage and transportation services, primarily attributable to new drilling projects in the Barnett Shale area. $0.6 million decrease in gas delivery and other services primarily due to lower per-unit margins partially offset by a nine percent increase in consolidated delivered gas sales volumes due to new customers in the power generation market. Per-unit margins were $0.13/Mcf in the current year compared with $0.14/Mcf in the prior year. The year-over-year decrease in per-unit margins reflects the impact of increased competition and lower basis spreads. The $47.2 million decrease in realized asset optimization margins from the prior year primarily reflects the unfavorable impact of weak natural gas market fundamentals which provided fewer favorable trading opportunities. Unrealized margins decreased $2.6 million in the current period compared to the prior-year period primarily due to the timing of year-over-year realized margins. Operating expenses decreased $5.0 million primarily due to lower employee-related expenses and ad valorem taxes. During fiscal 2011, our nonregulated segment recognized $30.3 million of noncash asset impairment charges associated with the two aforementioned projects. Interest charges decreased $6.6 million primarily due to a decrease in intercompany borrowings. 42 Table of Contents LIQUIDITY AND CAPITAL RESOURCES The liquidity required to fund our working capital, capital expenditures and other cash needs is provided from a variety of sources, including internally generated funds and borrowings under our commercial paper program and bank credit facilities. Additionally, we have various uncommitted trade credit lines with our gas suppliers that we utilize to purchase natural gas on a monthly basis. Finally, from time to time, we raise funds from the public debt and equity capital markets to fund our liquidity needs. We regularly evaluate our funding strategy and profile to ensure that we have sufficient liquidity for our short-term and long-term needs in a cost-effective manner. We also evaluate the levels of committed borrowing capacity that we require. Our Unsecured 5.125% Senior Notes were scheduled to mature in January 2013. On August 28, 2012 we redeemed these notes with proceeds received through the issuance of commercial paper. On September 27, 2012, we entered into a $260 million short-term financing facility that expires February 1, 2013 to repay the commercial paper borrowings utilized to redeem the notes. The short-term facility is expected to be repaid with the proceeds from the $350 million 30-year unsecured senior notes, which are expected to be issued in January 2013. We fixed the Treasury yield component of the interest cost associated with these anticipated senior notes at 4.07% by executing three Treasury lock agreements in August 2011. We designated all of these Treasury locks as cash flow hedges. We believe the liquidity provided by our senior notes and committed credit facilities, combined with our operating cash flows, will be sufficient to fund our working capital needs and capital expenditure program for fiscal year 2013. Cash Flows Our internally generated funds may change in the future due to a number of factors, some of which we cannot control. These include regulatory changes, the price for our services, the demand for such products and services, margin requirements resulting from significant changes in commodity prices, operational risks and other factors. Cash flows from operating, investing and financing activities for the years ended September 30, 2012, 2011 and 2010 are presented below. For the Fiscal Year Ended September 30 2012 2011 2010 2012 vs. 2011 2011 vs. 2010 (In thousands) Total cash provided by (used in) Operating activities $ 586,917 $ 582,844 $ 726,476 $ 4,073 $ (143,632 ) Investing activities (609,260 ) (627,386 ) (542,702 ) 18,126 (84,684 ) Financing activities (44,837 ) 44,009 (163,025 ) (88,846 ) 207,034 Change in cash and cash equivalents (67,180 ) (533 ) 20,749 (66,647 ) (21,282 ) Cash and cash equivalents at beginning of period 131,419 131,952 111,203 (533 ) 20,749 Cash and cash equivalents at end of period $ 64,239 $ 131,419 $ 131,952 $ (67,180 ) $ (533 ) Cash flows from operating activities Year-over-year changes in our operating cash flows primarily are attributable to changes in net income, working capital changes, particularly within our natural gas distribution segment resulting from the price of natural gas and the timing of customer collections, payments for natural gas purchases and purchased gas cost recoveries. The significant factors impacting our operating cash flow for the last three fiscal years are summarized below. 43 Table of Contents Fiscal Year ended September 30, 2012 compared with fiscal year ended September 30, 2011 For the fiscal year ended September 30, 2012, we generated operating cash flow of $586.9 million from operating activities compared with $582.8 million in the prior year. The year-over-year increase reflects changes in working capital offset by the $56.7 million increase in contributions made to our pension and postretirement plans during fiscal 2012. Fiscal Year ended September 30, 2011 compared with fiscal year ended September 30, 2010 For the fiscal year ended September 30, 2011, we generated operating cash flow of $582.8 million from operating activities compared with $726.5 million in fiscal September 30, 2010. The year-over-year decrease reflects the absence of an $85 million income tax refund received in the prior year coupled with the timing of gas cost recoveries under our purchased gas cost mechanisms and other net working capital changes. Cash flows from investing activities In recent fiscal years, a substantial portion of our cash resources has been used to fund our ongoing construction program and improvements to information technology systems. Our ongoing construction program enables us to provide safe and reliable natural gas distribution services to our existing customer base, expand our natural gas distribution services into new markets, enhance the integrity of our pipelines and, more recently, expand our intrastate pipeline network. In executing our current rate strategy, we are focusing our capital spending in jurisdictions that permit us to earn an adequate return timely on our investment without compromising the safety or reliability of our system. Currently, our Mid-Tex, Louisiana, Mississippi and West Texas natural gas distribution divisions and our Atmos Pipeline Texas Division have rate designs that provide the opportunity to include in their rate base approved capital costs on a periodic basis without being required to file a rate case. In early fiscal 2010, two coalitions of cities, representing the majority of the cities our Mid-Tex Division serves, agreed to a program of installing, beginning in the first quarter of fiscal 2011, 100,000 steel service line replacements during fiscal 2011 and 2012, with approved recovery of the associated return, depreciation and taxes for lines replaced between October 1, 2010 and September 30, 2012. As of September 30, 2012, we had replaced 98,675 lines. Since October 1, 2010 we have spent $116.3 million on steel service line replacements. For the fiscal year ended September 30, 2012, we incurred $732.9 million for capital expenditures compared with $623.0 million for the fiscal year ended September 30, 2011 and $542.6 million for the fiscal year ended September 30, 2010. The $109.9 million increase in capital expenditures in fiscal 2012 compared to fiscal 2011 primarily reflects spending for the steel service line replacement program in the Mid-Tex Division, the development of new customer billing and information systems for our natural gas distribution and our nonregulated segments and increased capital spending to increase the capacity on our Atmos Pipeline Texas system. As a result of these projects, we anticipate capital expenditures will remain elevated during the next fiscal year. The $80.4 million increase in capital expenditures in fiscal 2011 compared to fiscal 2010 primarily reflects spending for the steel service line replacement program in the Mid-Tex Division, the development of new customer billing and information systems for our natural gas distribution and our nonregulated segments and the construction of a new customer contact center in Amarillo, Texas, partially offset by costs incurred in the prior fiscal year to relocate the company information technology data center. Cash flows from financing activities For the fiscal year ended September 30, 2012, our financing activities used $44.8 million in cash, while financing activities for the fiscal year ended September 30, 2011 generated $44.0 million in cash compared with cash of $163.0 million used for the fiscal year ended September 30, 2010. Our significant financing activities for the fiscal years ended September 30, 2012, 2011 and 2010 are summarized as follows: 2012 During the fiscal year ended September 30, 2012, we: Paid $257.0 million for long-term debt repayments, including the early redemption of our $250 million 5.125% Senior notes that were scheduled to mature in January 2013. 44 Table of Contents Borrowed $260 million under a short-term loan to finance the repayment of our $250 million 5.125% Senior notes. Borrowed a net $94.1 million under our short-term facilities, excluding the $260 million short-term loan used to finance the early redemption of our $250 million 5.125% Senior notes, to fund working capital needs. Paid $125.8 million in cash dividends, which reflected a payout ratio of 58 percent of net income. Paid $12.5 million for the repurchase of common stock as part of our share buyback program. Paid $5.2 million for the repurchase of equity awards. 2011 During the fiscal year ended September 30, 2011, we: Received $394.5 million net cash proceeds in June 2011 related to the issuance of $400 million 5.50% senior notes due 2041. Borrowed a net $83.3 million under our short-term facilities to fund working capital needs. Received $27.8 million cash in March 2011 related to the unwinding of two Treasury locks. Received $20.1 million cash in June 2011 related to the settlement of three Treasury locks associated with the $400 million 5.50% senior notes offering. Received $7.8 million net proceeds related to the issuance of 0.3 million shares of common stock. Paid $360.1 million for scheduled long-term debt repayments, including our $350 million 7.375% senior notes that were paid on their maturity date on May 15, 2011. Paid $124.0 million in cash dividends which reflected a payout ratio of 60 percent of net income. Paid $5.3 million for the repurchase of equity awards. 2010 During the fiscal year ended September 30, 2010, we: Paid $124.3 million in cash dividends which reflected a payout ratio of 61 percent of net income. Paid $100.5 million for the repurchase of common stock under an accelerated share repurchase agreement. Borrowed a net $54.3 million under our short-term facilities due to the impact of seasonal natural gas purchases. Received $8.8 million net proceeds related to the issuance of 0.4 million shares of common stock, which is a 68 percent decrease compared to the prior year due primarily to the fact that beginning in fiscal 2010 shares were purchased on the open market rather than being issued by us to the Direct Stock Purchase Plan and the Retirement Savings Plan. Paid $1.2 million to repurchase equity awards. 45 Table of Contents The following table shows the number of shares issued for the fiscal years ended September 30, 2012, 2011 and 2010: For the Fiscal Year Ended September 30 2012 2011 2010 Shares issued: Direct stock purchase plan 103,529 Retirement savings plan 79,722 1998 Long-term incentive plan 482,289 675,255 421,706 Outside directors stock-for-fee plan 2,375 2,385 3,382 Total shares issued 484,664 677,640 608,339 The decreased number of shares issued in fiscal 2012 compared with the number of shares issued in fiscal 2011 primarily reflects a decrease in the number of shares issued under our 1998 Long-Term Incentive Plan (LTIP), due to the exercise of a significant number of stock options during fiscal 2011. During fiscal 2012, we cancelled and retired 153,255 shares attributable to federal withholdings on equity awards and repurchased and retired 387,991 shares attributable to our share repurchase program, which are not included in the table above. The increase in the number of shares issued in fiscal 2011 compared with the number of shares issued in fiscal 2010 primarily reflects an increased number of shares issued under our LTIP due to the exercise of a significant number of stock options during fiscal 2011. This increase was partially offset by the fact that we purchased shares in the open market rather than issuing new shares for the Direct Stock Purchase Plan and the Retirement Savings Plan. During fiscal 2011, we cancelled and retired 169,793 shares attributable to federal withholdings on equity awards and repurchased and retired 375,468 shares attributable to our 2010 accelerated share repurchase agreement, which are not included in the table above. As of September 30, 2011, we were authorized to grant awards for up to a maximum of 6.5 million shares of common stock under our LTIP. In February 2011, shareholders voted to increase the number of authorized LTIP shares by 2.2 million shares. On October 19, 2011, we received all required state regulatory approvals to increase the maximum number of authorized LTIP shares to 8.7 million shares, subject to certain adjustment provisions. On October 28, 2011, we filed with the SEC a registration statement on Form S-8 to register an additional 2.2 million shares; we also listed such shares with the New York Stock Exchange. Credit Facilities Our short-term borrowing requirements are affected by the seasonal nature of the natural gas business. Changes in the price of natural gas and the amount of natural gas we need to supply to meet our customers needs could significantly affect our borrowing requirements. We finance our short-term borrowing requirements through a combination of a $750 million commercial paper program collateralized by our $750 million unsecured credit facility and four committed revolving credit facilities with third-party lenders. As a result, we have approximately $989 million of working capital funding. Additionally, our $750 million unsecured credit facility has an accordion feature, which, if utilized, would increase borrowing capacity to $1.0 billion. We also use intercompany credit facilities to supplement the funding provided by these third-party committed credit facilities. Shelf Registration We have an effective shelf registration statement with the Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC) that permits us to issue a total of $1.3 billion in common stock and/or debt securities. The shelf registration statement has been approved by all requisite state regulatory commissions. With the closing of the sale of our Missouri, Illinois and Iowa operations on August 1, 2012, there are no longer any restrictions on our ability to issue either debt or equity under the shelf until it expires on March 31, 2013, with $900 million available for issuance at September 30, 2012. We intend to file a new shelf registration statement with the SEC for at least $1.3 billion prior to the expiration of the current shelf. 46 Table of Contents Credit Ratings Our credit ratings directly affect our ability to obtain short-term and long-term financing, in addition to the cost of such financing. In determining our credit ratings, the rating agencies consider a number of quantitative factors, including debt to total capitalization, operating cash flow relative to outstanding debt, operating cash flow coverage of interest and pension liabilities and funding status. In addition, the rating agencies consider qualitative factors such as consistency of our earnings over time, the quality of our management and business strategy, the risks associated with our regulated and nonregulated businesses and the regulatory environment in the states where we operate. Our debt is rated by three rating agencies: Standard & Poor Corporation (S&P), Moody Investors Service (Moody s) and Fitch Ratings, Ltd. (Fitch). Our current debt ratings are all considered investment grade and are as follows: S&P Moody Fitch Unsecured senior long-term debt BBB+ Baa1 A- Commercial paper A-2 P-2 F-2 A significant degradation in our operating performance or a significant reduction in our liquidity caused by more limited access to the private and public credit markets as a result of deteriorating global or national financial and credit conditions could trigger a negative change in our ratings outlook or even a reduction in our credit ratings by the three credit rating agencies. This would mean more limited access to the private and public credit markets and an increase in the costs of such borrowings. A credit rating is not a recommendation to buy, sell or hold securities. The highest investment grade credit rating is AAA for S&P, Aaa for Moody and AAA for Fitch. The lowest investment grade credit rating is BBB- for S&P, Baa3 for Moody and BBB- for Fitch. Our credit ratings may be revised or withdrawn at any time by the rating agencies, and each rating should be evaluated independently of any other rating. There can be no assurance that a rating will remain in effect for any given period of time or that a rating will not be lowered, or withdrawn entirely, by a rating agency if, in its judgment, circumstances so warrant. Debt Covenants We were in compliance with all of our debt covenants as of September 30, 2012. Our debt covenants are described in Note 7 to the consolidated financial statements. Capitalization The following table presents our capitalization as of September 30, 2012 and 2011: September 30 2012 2011 (In thousands, except percentages) Short-term debt $ 570,929 11.7 % $ 206,396 4.4 % Long-term debt 1,956,436 40.0 % 2,208,551 47.3 % Shareholders equity 2,359,243 48.3 % 2,255,421 48.3 % Total capitalization, including short-term debt $ 4,886,608 100.0 % $ 4,670,368 100.0 % Total debt as a percentage of total capitalization, including short-term debt, was 51.7 percent at September 30, 2012 and 2011. Our ratio of total debt to capitalization is typically greater during the winter heating season as we make additional short-term borrowings to fund natural gas purchases and meet our working capital requirements. We intend to continue to maintain our debt to capitalization ratio in a target range of 50 to 55 percent. 47 Table of Contents Contractual Obligations and Commercial Commitments The following table provides information about contractual obligations and commercial commitments at September 30, 2012.

(2) Interest charges were calculated using the stated rate for each debt issuance. (3) Gas purchase commitments were determined based upon contractually determined volumes at prices estimated based upon the index specified in the contract, adjusted for estimated basis differentials and contractual discounts as of September 30, 2012. (4) See Note 14 to the consolidated financial statements. (5) Represents third party contractual demand fees for contracted storage in our nonregulated segment. Contractual demand fees for contracted storage for our natural gas distribution segment are excluded as these costs are fully recoverable through our purchase gas adjustment mechanisms. (6) Represents third party contractual demand fees for transportation in our nonregulated segment. (7) Represents liabilities for natural gas commodity financial instruments that were valued as of September 30, 2012. The ultimate settlement amounts of these remaining liabilities are unknown because they are subject to continuing market risk until the financial instruments are settled. The table above excludes $0.3 million of current liabilities from risk management activities that are classified as liabilities held for sale in conjunction with the sale of our Georgia operations. (8) Represents expected contributions to our postretirement benefit plans. (9) Represents liabilities associated with uncertain tax positions claimed or expected to be claimed on tax returns. (10) Total contractual obligations exclude pension plan contributions, which are discussed in Note 9. We anticipate contributing between $30 million and $40 million to these plans during fiscal 2013. AEH has commitments to purchase physical quantities of natural gas under contracts indexed to the forward NYMEX strip or fixed price contracts. At September 30, 2012, AEH was committed to purchase 72.2 Bcf within one year, 29.0 Bcf within one to three years and 29.0 Bcf after three years under indexed contracts. AEH is committed to purchase 3.8 Bcf within one year and 0.3 Bcf within one to three years under fixed price contracts with prices ranging from $2.46 to $6.36 per Mcf. 48 Table of Contents With the exception of our Mid-Tex Division, our natural gas distribution segment maintains supply contracts with several vendors that generally cover a period of up to one year. Commitments for estimated base gas volumes are established under these contracts on a monthly basis at contractually negotiated prices. Commitments for incremental daily purchases are made as necessary during the month in accordance with the terms of individual contracts. Our Mid-Tex Division maintains long-term supply contracts to ensure a reliable source of natural gas for our customers in its service area which obligate it to purchase specified volumes at market prices. The estimated commitments under the terms of these contracts as of September 30, 2012 are reflected in the table above. Risk Management Activities As discussed above in our Critical Accounting Policies, we use financial instruments to mitigate commodity price risk and, periodically, to manage interest rate risk. We conduct risk management activities through our natural gas distribution and nonregulated segments. In our natural gas distribution segment, we use a combination of physical storage, fixed physical contracts and fixed financial contracts to reduce our exposure to unusually large winter-period gas price increases. In our nonregulated segments, we manage our exposure to the risk of natural gas price changes and lock in our gross profit margin through a combination of storage and financial instruments, including futures, over-the-counter and exchange-traded options and swap contracts with counterparties. To the extent our inventory cost and actual sales and actual purchases do not correlate with the changes in the market indices we use in our hedges, we could experience ineffectiveness or the hedges may no longer meet the accounting requirements for hedge accounting, resulting in the financial instruments being treated as mark to market instruments through earnings. We use financial instruments, designated as cash flow hedges of anticipated purchases and sales at index prices, to mitigate the commodity price risk in our nonregulated segment associated with deliveries under fixed-priced forward contracts to deliver gas to customers, and we use financial instruments, designated as fair value hedges, to hedge our natural gas inventory used in our asset optimization activities in our nonregulated segment. Also, in our nonregulated segment, we use storage swaps and futures to capture additional storage arbitrage opportunities that arise subsequent to the execution of the original fair value hedge associated with our physical natural gas inventory, basis swaps to insulate and protect the economic value of our fixed price and storage books and various over-the-counter and exchange-traded options. These financial instruments have not been designated as hedges. We record our financial instruments as a component of risk management assets and liabilities, which are classified as current or noncurrent based upon the anticipated settlement date of the underlying financial instrument. Substantially all of our financial instruments are valued using external market quotes and indices. The following table shows the components of the change in fair value of our natural gas distribution segment financial instruments for the fiscal year ended September 30, 2012 (in thousands): Fair value of contracts at September 30, 2011 $ (79,277) Contracts realized/settled (32,027 ) Fair value of new contracts 4,782 Other changes in value 30,262 Fair value of contracts at September 30, 2012 $ (76,260 ) The fair value of our natural gas distribution segment financial instruments at September 30, 2012, is presented below by time period and fair value source: Fair Value of Contracts at September 30, 2012 Maturity in years Source of Fair Value Less than 1 1-3 4-5 Greater than 5 Total Fair Value (In thousands) Prices actively quoted $ (78,543 ) $ 2,283 $ $ $ (76,260 ) Prices based on models and other valuation methods Total Fair Value $ (78,543 ) $ 2,283 $ $ $ (76,260 ) 49 Table of Contents The tables above include $0.1 million of current assets from risk management activities that are classified as assets held for sale and $0.3 million of current liabilities from risk management activities that are classified as liabilities held for sale in conjunction with the sale of our Georgia operations.

These programs include medical and dental insurance coverage and pension and postretirement programs. Medical and Dental Insurance We offer medical and dental insurance programs to substantially all of our employees, and we believe these programs are consistent with other programs in our industry. Since 2006, we have experienced medical and prescription inflation of approximately six percent. In recent years, we have strived to actively manage our health care costs through the introduction of a wellness strategy that is focused on helping employees to identify health risks and to manage these risks through improved lifestyle choices. In March 2010, President Obama signed The Patient Protection and Affordable Care Act into law (the Health Care Reform Act ). The Health Care Reform Act will be phased in over an eight-year period. We have changed the design of our health care plans to comply with provisions of the Health Care Reform Act that have already gone into effect or will be going into effect in future years. For example, lifetime maximums on benefits have been eliminated, coverage for dependent children has been extended to age 26 and all costs of preventive coverage must be paid for by the insurer. In 2014, health insurance exchanges will open in each state in order to provide a competitive marketplace for purchasing health insurance by individuals. Companies who offer health insurance to their employees could face a substantial increase in premiums at that time if they choose to continue to provide such coverage. However, companies who elect to cease providing health insurance to their employees will be faced with paying significant penalties to the federal government for each employee who receives coverage through an exchange. We will continue to monitor all developments on health care reform and continue to comply with all existing relevant laws and regulations. For fiscal 2013, we anticipate an approximate seven percent medical and prescription drug inflation rate, primarily due to anticipated higher claims costs and the implementation of the Health Care Reform Act. 50 Table of Contents Net Periodic Pension and Postretirement Benefit Costs For the fiscal year ended September 30, 2012, our total net periodic pension and other benefits costs was $69.2 million, compared with $56.6 million and $50.8 million for the fiscal years ended September 30, 2011 and 2010. These costs relating to our natural gas distribution operations are recoverable through our gas distribution rates. A portion of these costs is capitalized into our gas distribution rate base, and the remaining costs are recorded as a component of operation and maintenance expense. Our fiscal 2012 costs were determined using a September 30, 2011 measurement date. At that date, interest and corporate bond rates utilized to determine our discount rates were significantly lower than the interest and corporate bond rates as of September 30, 2010, the measurement date for our fiscal 2011 net periodic cost. Accordingly, we decreased our discount rate used to determine our fiscal 2012 pension and benefit costs to 5.05 percent. Our expected return on our pension plan assets was reduced to 7.75 percent due to historical experience and the current market projection of the target asset allocation. As a result, our fiscal 2012 pension and postretirement medical costs were higher than in the prior year. The increase in total net periodic pension and other benefits costs during fiscal 2011 compared with fiscal 2010 primarily reflects the decrease in our discount rate at September 30, 2010, the measurement date for our fiscal 2011 pension and postretirement costs. The discount rate used to compute the present value of a plan liabilities generally is based on rates of high-grade corporate bonds with maturities similar to the average period over which the benefits will be paid. At our September 30, 2010 measurement date, the interest rates were significantly higher than the interest rates at September 30, 2009, the measurement date used to determine our fiscal 2009 net periodic cost. Our expected return on our pension plan assets remained constant at 8.25 percent. Pension and Postretirement Plan Funding Generally, our funding policy is to contribute annually an amount that will at least equal the minimum amount required to comply with the Employee Retirement Income Security Act of 1974 (ERISA). However, additional voluntary contributions are made from time to time as considered necessary. Contributions are intended to provide not only for benefits attributed to service to date but also for those expected to be earned in the future. In accordance with the Pension Protection Act of 2006 (PPA), we determined the funded status of our plans as of January 1, 2012. Based on this valuation, we were required to contribute cash of $46.5 million to our pension plans during fiscal 2012. The need for this funding primarily reflects a decrease in the discount rate used to determine our obligations under our plans. This contribution increased the level of our plan assets to achieve a desirable PPA funding threshold. During fiscal 2011, we were required to contribute cash of $0.9 million to our pension plans. The need for this funding reflected the decline in the fair value of the plans assets resulting from the unfavorable market conditions experienced during 2008 and 2009. This contribution increased the level of our plan assets to achieve a desirable PPA funding threshold. During fiscal 2010, we did not contribute cash to our pension plans as the fair value of the plans assets recovered somewhat during the year from the unfavorable market conditions experienced in the latter half of calendar year 2008 and our plan assets were sufficient to achieve a desirable funding threshold as established by the PPA. We contributed $22.1 million, $11.3 million and $11.8 million to our postretirement benefits plans for the fiscal years ended September 30, 2012, 2011 and 2010. The contributions represent the portion of the postretirement costs we are responsible for under the terms of our plan and minimum funding required by state regulatory commissions. Outlook for Fiscal 2013 and Beyond As of September 30, 2012, interest and corporate bond rates utilized to determine our discount rates, which impacted our fiscal 2013 net periodic pension and postretirement costs, were lower than the interest and corporate bond rates as of September 30, 2011, the measurement date for our fiscal 2012 net periodic cost. As a result of the lower interest and corporate bond rates, we decreased the discount rate used to determine our fiscal 2013 51 Table of Contents pension and benefit costs to 4.04 percent. We maintained the expected return on our pension plan assets at 7.75 percent, based on historical experience and the current market projection of the target asset allocation. Due to the decrease in our discount rate, we expect our fiscal 2013 pension and postretirement medical costs to increase compared to fiscal 2012. Based upon market conditions subsequent to September 30, 2012 the current funded position of the plans and the new funding requirements under the PPA, we anticipate contributing between $30 million and $40 million to the Plans in fiscal 2013. Further, we will consider whether an additional voluntary contribution is prudent to maintain certain PPA funding thresholds. With respect to our postretirement medical plans, we anticipate contributing between $25 million and $30 million during fiscal 2013. The projected pension liability, future funding requirements and the amount of pension expense or income recognized for the Plan are subject to change, depending upon the actuarial value of plan assets and the determination of future benefit obligations as of each subsequent actuarial calculation date. These amounts are impacted by actual investment returns, changes in interest rates and changes in the demographic composition of the participants in the plan. In August 2010, the Board of Directors of Atmos Energy approved a proposal to close the Pension Account Plan (PAP) to new participants, effective October 1, 2010. Employees participating in the PAP as of October 1, 2010 were allowed to make a one-time election to migrate from the PAP into our defined contribution plan with enhanced features, effective January 1, 2011. Participants who chose to remain in the PAP have continued to earn benefits and interest allocations with no changes to their existing benefits. RECENT ACCOUNTING DEVELOPMENTS Recent accounting developments and their impact on our financial position, results of operations and cash flows are described in Note 2 to the consolidated financial statements.
