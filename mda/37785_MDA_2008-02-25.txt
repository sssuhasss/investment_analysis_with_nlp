ITEM 7. MANAGEMENT S DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS OF FINANCIAL CONDITION AND RESULTS OF OPERATIONS Overview We are a diversified, global chemical company providing innovative solutions and applications to a wide variety of end markets. We operate in three business segments: Agricultural Products, Specialty Chemicals and Industrial Chemicals. Agricultural Products principal focus is on insecticides, which are used to enhance crop yield and quality by controlling a wide spectrum of pests, and on herbicides, which are used to reduce the need for manual or mechanical weeding by inhibiting or preventing weed growth. Specialty Chemicals consists of our BioPolymer and lithium businesses and focuses on food ingredients that are used to enhance texture, structure and physical stability, pharmaceutical additives for binding and disintegrant use and lithium specialties for pharmaceutical synthesis, specialty polymers and energy storage. Our Industrial Chemicals segment manufactures a wide range of inorganic materials, including soda ash, peroxygens and phosphorus chemicals. 2007 Highlights 2007 was a year in which we experienced continued sales growth in all of our business segments. Consolidated revenue of $2,632.9 million was up 12.2 percent from the prior year. Agricultural Products, Specialty Chemicals and Industrial Chemicals had revenue increases of 16 percent, 11 percent and 10 percent, respectively. We also had strong performance across most of our business segments for the year ended December 31, 2007. Segment operating profit, as presented in Note 19 to the consolidated financial statements in this Form 10-K, increased 21.0 percent for the year ended December 31, 2007 compared to the prior period. We continue to be impacted by higher energy costs and higher raw material costs. Included in our net income were various restructuring and other income and charges which are described in more detail below under Results of Operations. Our segment results for the year ended December 31, 2007 were impacted, in particular, by the following: Agricultural Products segment operating profits increased significantly due to higher sales in all geographic regions, particularly in Brazil as a result of buoyant market conditions, including high commodity prices for most crops, as well as continued global supply chain productivity improvements, which more than offset higher incremental selling and distribution costs due to increased sales and higher energy and raw materials costs. Specialty Chemicals segment operating profits increased as a result of higher selling prices in primary lithium compounds and strong commercial performance in both pharmaceutical and food businesses in BioPolymer. Segment operating profit also increased due to improved mix and continued productivity improvements, which more than offset increased raw material costs. Industrial Chemicals segment operating profits decreased for the year ended December 31, 2007 and were unfavorably impacted by higher energy and raw material costs across its businesses and lower electricity selling prices in Spain in the first three quarters of the year, where Foret operates electricity cogeneration facilities and excess electricity is sold into the Spanish electrical grid. These higher costs more than offset higher selling prices and export volume growth in soda ash. 2008 Outlook In 2008, we expect continued growth in our revenue and earnings. The increase in revenue is expected to be driven by higher selling prices for soda ash, higher volumes in BioPolymer and lithium, higher selling prices in Biopolymer and, in Agricultural Products, a healthy global agribusiness economy, new product introductions and increased demand for biofuels. The increase in earnings is expected to be driven by sales growth, new product introductions and further supply chain productivity improvements in Agricultural Products, continued strong commercial performance in BioPolymer, and aggregate price and volume benefits in Industrial Chemicals. Higher raw material and energy costs are expected to partially offset our profit growth. We expect cash flow generation from our business segments to remain strong. 28 Table of Contents Critical Accounting Policies Our consolidated financial statements are prepared in conformity with U.S generally accepted accounting principles. The preparation of these financial statements requires us to make estimates and judgments that affect the reported amounts of assets, liabilities, revenues and expenses. We have described our accounting policies in Note 1 to our consolidated financial statements included in this Form 10-K. We have reviewed these accounting policies, identifying those that we believe to be critical to the preparation and understanding of our consolidated financial statements. We have reviewed with the Audit Committee those accounting policies that we have deemed critical. These policies are central to our presentation of results of operations and financial condition and require management to make estimates and judgments on certain matters. We base our estimates and judgments on historical experience, current conditions and other reasonable factors. Environmental obligations We provide for environmental-related obligations when they are probable and amounts can be reasonably estimated. Where the available information is sufficient to estimate the amount of liability, that estimate has been used. Where the information is only sufficient to establish a range of probable liability and no point within the range is more likely than any other, the lower end of the range has been used. Estimated obligations to remediate sites that involve oversight by the EPA, or similar government agencies, are generally accrued no later than when a ROD, or equivalent, is issued, or upon completion of a RI/FS that is submitted by us to the appropriate government agency or agencies. Estimates are reviewed quarterly by our environmental remediation management, as well as by financial and legal management and, if necessary, adjusted as additional information becomes available. The estimates can change substantially as additional information becomes available regarding the nature or extent of site contamination, required remediation methods, and other actions by or against governmental agencies or private parties. Our environmental liabilities for continuing and discontinued operations are principally for costs associated with the remediation and/or study of sites at which we are alleged to have disposed of hazardous substances. Such costs principally include, among other items, RI/FS, site remediation, costs of operation and maintenance of the remediation plan, fees to outside law firms and consultants for work related to the environmental effort, and future monitoring costs. Estimated site liabilities are determined based upon existing remediation laws and technologies, specific site consultants engineering studies or by extrapolating experience with environmental issues at comparable sites. Included in the environmental reserve balance, other assets and reasonably possible loss contingencies for 2007 are potentially recoverable amounts from third party insurance policies, and some of these amounts have been recognized as offsetting recoveries in 2007. Provisions for environmental costs are reflected in income, net of probable and estimable recoveries from named PRPs or other third parties. Such provisions incorporate inflation and are not discounted to their present values. In calculating and evaluating the adequacy of our environmental reserves, we have taken into account the joint and several liability imposed by CERCLA and the analogous state laws on all PRPs and have considered the identity and financial condition of each of the other PRPs at each site to the extent possible. We have also considered the identity and financial condition of other third parties from whom recovery is anticipated, as well as the status of our claims against such parties. Although we are unable to forecast the ultimate contributions of PRPs and other third parties with absolute certainty, the degree of uncertainty with respect to each party is taken into account when determining the environmental reserve by adjusting the reserve to reflect the facts and circumstances on a site-by-site basis. Our liability includes our best estimate of the costs expected to be paid before the consideration of any potential recoveries from third parties. We believe that any recorded recoveries related to PRPs are realizable in all material respects. Recoveries are recorded as either an offset in Environmental liabilities, continuing and discontinued or as Other Assets in our consolidated balance sheets. 29 Table of Contents Impairments and valuation of long-lived assets Our long-lived assets include property, plant and equipment and long-term investments, goodwill and intangible assets. We test for impairment whenever events or circumstances indicate that the net book value of these assets may not be recoverable from the estimated undiscounted expected future cash flows expected to result from their use and eventual disposition. In cases where the estimated undiscounted expected future cash flows are less than net book value, an impairment loss is recognized equal to the amount by which the net book value exceeds the estimated fair value of assets, which is based on discounted cash flows at the lowest level determinable. The estimated cash flows reflect our assumptions about selling prices, volumes, costs and market conditions over a reasonable period of time. We prepare an annual impairment test of goodwill. The assumptions used to estimate fair value include our best estimate of future growth rates, discount rates and market conditions over a reasonable period. We performed this test in 2007 and determined that no impairment charge was required. Pensions and other postretirement benefits We provide qualified and nonqualified defined benefit and defined contribution pension plans, as well as postretirement health care and life insurance benefit plans to our employees. Effective July 1, 2007, all of our newly hired and rehired salaried and nonunion hourly employees are no longer eligible for our defined benefit pension plans. The costs (benefits) and obligations related to these benefits reflect key assumptions related to general economic conditions, including interest (discount) rates, healthcare cost trend rates, expected rates of return on plan assets and the rates of compensation increases for employees. The costs (benefits) and obligations for these benefit programs are also affected by other assumptions, such as average retirement age, mortality, employee turnover, and plan participation. To the extent our plans actual experience, as influenced by changing economic and financial market conditions or by changes to our own plans demographics, differs from these assumptions, the costs and obligations for providing these benefits, as well as the plans funding requirements, could increase or decrease. When actual results differ from our assumptions, the difference is typically recognized over future periods. In addition, the unrealized gains and losses related to our pension and postretirement benefit obligations may also affect periodic benefit costs (benefits) in future periods. We use certain calculated values of assets under methods both to estimate the expected rate of return on assets component of pension cost and to calculate our plans funding requirements. The expected rate of return on plan assets is based on a market-related value of assets that recognizes investment gains and losses over a five-year period. We use an actuarial value of assets to determine our plans funding requirements. The actuarial value of assets must be within a certain range, high or low, of the actual market value of assets, and is adjusted accordingly. We recorded $11.5 million, $15.1 million and $10.6 million of net annual pension and other postretirement benefit cost in 2007, 2006 and 2005, respectively. As of December 31, 2006 we adopted a new pension accounting standard (see Note 13 to the consolidated financial statements in this Form 10-K) which required us to recognize in our consolidated balance sheet the total underfunded status of our defined benefit postretirement plans. The underfunded status is defined as the difference between the fair value of the plan assets and the projected benefit obligation. At December 31, 2007 and 2006, our net underfunded status recorded on our consolidated balance sheets was $110.6 million and $140.2 million, respectively. We made voluntary cash contributions to our U.S. qualified pension plan of $30.0 million in both 2007 and 2006. In addition, we paid nonqualified pension benefits from company assets of $3.0 million and $2.7 million, for 2007 and 2006, respectively. We paid other postretirement benefits, net of participant contributions, of $4.7 million and $5.0 million for 2007 and 2006, respectively. Our estimated cash contributions for 2008 include approximately $3.0 million in nonqualified pension benefits, $4.2 million in other postretirement benefits, and we plan to make voluntary cash contributions to our U.S. qualified pension plan of approximately $30.0 million. 30 Table of Contents We select the discount rate used to calculate pension and other postretirement obligations based on a review of available yields on high-quality corporate bonds, including Moody Investors Service, Inc. ( Moody ) Aa-rated Corporate and Industrial bond indices. In selecting the discount rate for 2007, we placed particular emphasis on a yield-curve approach designed by our actuary to derive an appropriate discount rate for computing the present value of the future cash flows associated with our pension and other postretirement obligations taking into consideration both the timing and amount of the cash flows. The specific interest rates supporting the yield curve were derived from calculated returns (yields) from a portfolio of high-quality (Aa-graded or higher) bond investments constructed by our actuary. In developing the expected long-term rate of return on asset assumption for our plan, we take into consideration the technical analysis performed by our outside actuaries, including historical market returns, information on long-term real return expectations by asset class, inflation assumptions, and expectations for standard deviation related to these best estimates. We also consider the historical performance of our own plan trust, which has earned a compound annual rate of return of approximately 9.5 percent over the last 10 years (which is in excess of comparable market indices for the same period) as well as other factors. The current asset allocation for our plan is approximately 79 percent equities (U.S. and non-U.S.), 18 percent fixed-income and 3 percent cash and other short-term investments. Given an actively managed investment portfolio, the expected annual rates of return by asset class for our portfolio, using geometric averaging, and after being adjusted for an estimated inflation rate of approximately 3 percent, is between 9 percent and 11 percent for both U.S. and non-U.S. equities, and between 5 percent and 7.5 percent for fixed-income investments, which generates a total expected portfolio return that is in line with our rate of return assumption. We continually monitor the appropriateness of this rate in light of current market conditions. For the sensitivity of our pension costs to incremental changes in assumptions see our discussion below. Sensitivity analysis related to key pension and postretirement benefit assumptions. A one-half percent increase in the assumed discount rate would have decreased pension and other postretirement benefit obligations by $52.5 million at December 31, 2007 and $53.0 million at December 31, 2006, and decreased pension and other postretirement benefit costs by $3.7 million, $5.2 million and $3.0 million for 2007, 2006 and 2005, respectively. A one-half percent decrease in the assumed discount rate would have increased pension and other postretirement benefit obligations by $57.7 million at December 31, 2007 and $57.1 million at December 31, 2006, and increased pension and other postretirement benefit net periodic benefit cost by $6.1 million, $5.9 million and $5.6 million for 2007, 2006 and 2005, respectively. A one-half percent increase in the assumed expected long-term rate of return on plan assets would have decreased pension costs by $4.0 million, $3.6 million and $3.4 million for 2007, 2006 and 2005, respectively. A one-half percent decrease in the assumed long-term rate of return on plan assets would have increased pension costs by $4.0 million, $3.6 million and $3.4 million for 2007, 2006 and 2005, respectively. Further details on our pension and other postretirement benefit obligations and net periodic benefit costs (benefits) are found in Note 13 to our consolidated financial statements in this Form 10-K. Income taxes We have recorded a valuation allowance to reduce deferred tax assets to the amount that we believe is more likely than not to be realized. In assessing the need for this allowance, we have considered a number of factors including future income, the jurisdictions in which such income is earned and our ongoing tax planning strategies. In the event that we determine that we would not be able to realize all or part of our net deferred tax assets in the future, an adjustment to the deferred tax assets would be charged to income in the period such determination was made. Similarly, should we conclude that we would be able to realize certain deferred tax assets in the future in excess of the net recorded amount, an adjustment to the deferred tax assets would increase income in the period such determination was made. At December 31, 2007 and 2006, the valuation allowance was $65.1 million and $81.5 million, respectively. 31 Table of Contents Results of Operations 2007, 2006 and 2005 Overview Year Ended December 31, 2007 2006 2005 Per Share (Diluted) Per Share (Diluted) Per Share (Diluted) (In Millions, Except Per Share Data) Consolidated Revenue $ 2,632.9 $ 2,345.9 $ 2,146.0 Net income $ 132.4 $ 1.71 $ 131.3 $ 1.66 $ 114.0 $ 1.45 Net income includes the following after-tax charges (gains): Restructuring and other charges/(income), net (1) $ 97.0 $ 1.25 $ 57.9 $ 0.73 $ 26.1 $ 0.33 In-process research and development 1.2 0.02 1.2 0.02 Astaris restructuring (2) (0.2 ) Investment gains (3) (24.1 ) (0.31 ) Loss on extinguishment of debt 0.2 0.01 37.4 0.48 Cumulative effect of change in accounting principle 0.5 0.01 Discontinued operations 24.3 0.31 12.8 0.16 (6.1 ) (0.08 ) Tax adjustments (15.4 ) (0.21 ) 12.5 0.16 21.7 0.28 After-tax income from continuing operations excluding restructuring and other income and charges (4) $ 239.7 $ 3.09 $ 215.7 $ 2.73 $ 169.3 $ 2.16 (1) In addition to the line item Restructuring and other charges of $162.9 million ($102.5 million after-tax) as presented in our consolidated statement of income this line in the above reconciliation includes the following: Amounts shown for 2007 reflect a gain of $0.4 million ($0.3 million after-tax) from the difference between the carrying value of our remaining investment in the Astaris joint venture and cash received from the joint venture. This gain is included in Equity in (earnings) of affiliates in the consolidated statement of income for the year ended December 31, 2007. In 2005 Astaris sold substantially all of the assets of its business and the buyers assumed certain of the liabilities of Astaris. The amounts shown for 2007 also reflect minority interest of $1.4 million associated with our decision to abandon a co-generation facility at Foret during the second quarter of 2007. This amount is shown in Minority interest on the consolidated statement of income for the year ended December 31, 2007. Additionally, the amounts shown for 2007 reflect a $6.1 million ($3.8 million after-tax) benefit related to a correction of LIFO inventory reserves related to prior periods. See Note 1 to our consolidated financial statements in this Form 10-K for further detail on this matter. This adjustment has been recorded as a component of Costs of sales and services in the consolidated statements of income for the year ended December 31, 2007. (2) Our share of charges recorded by Astaris, the phosphorous joint venture prior to the sale of substantially all of its assets is included in Equity in (earnings) loss of affiliates in the consolidated statements of income. Income for the year ended December 31, 2005 represents adjustments to liabilities related to restructuring and other charges recorded by Astaris prior to the sale of substantially all of its assets. 32 Table of Contents (3) Investment gains include a gain in connection with Astaris sale of substantially all of its assets. This gain is included in equity in (earnings) loss of affiliates in the consolidated statements of income for the year ended December 31, 2005. (4) We believe that the Non-GAAP financial measure After-tax income from continuing operations, excluding restructuring and other income and charges, and its presentation on a per-share basis, provides useful information about our operating results to investors and securities analysts. We also believe that excluding the effect of restructuring and other income and charges from operating results allows management and investors to compare more easily the financial performance of our underlying businesses from period to period. This measure should not be considered as a substitute for net income (loss) or other measures of performance or liquidity reported in accordance with GAAP. The after-tax charges (gains) included in net income presented in the chart above can be found in the results of operations discussions below for 2007 compared to 2006 and for 2006 compared to 2005. See Segment Results for a detailed discussion of events affecting our results for 2007, 2006 and 2005. Results of Operations 2007 compared to 2006 In the following discussion, year refers to the year ended December 31, 2007 and prior year refers to the year ended December 31, 2006. Additionally, in the discussion below, please refer to our consolidated statements of income and our segment information from Note 19 included in Item 8 of this Form 10-K as well as the after-tax charges included in net income in the above table. All comparisons are between the periods unless otherwise noted. Revenue for the year ended December 31, 2007 was $2,632.9 million, an increase of 12.2 percent compared to the $2,345.9 million recorded in the prior year period. This increase was driven by higher sales in all of our segments, which are discussed separately below. In-Process Research and Development for the years ended December 31, 2007 and 2006 was $2.0 million ($1.2 million after tax) and $2.0 million ($1.2 million after tax), respectively. In the first quarter of 2007, our Agricultural Products segment acquired further rights for $1.0 million from a third-party company to develop a proprietary compound. In the third quarter of 2007, our Agricultural Products segment entered into a collaboration and license agreement with a third-party company for the purpose of obtaining certain technology and intellectual property rights. We paid an initial $1.0 million upon entering into this agreement. For the year ended December 31, 2006, our Agricultural Products segment entered into development agreements with a third-party company whereby we were given the right to develop further one of such party products in certain geographic markets for $2.0 million. Restructuring and other charges were $162.9 million ($102.5 million after-tax) in 2007 compared to $74.8 million ($57.9 million after-tax) in 2006. Charges in this category for the year ended December 31, 2007 primarily include the following: Charges totaling $104.9 million for our phase-out of the Agricultural Products chemical facility in Baltimore, Maryland in our Agricultural Products segment. These charges consisted of (i) plant and equipment impairment charges and accelerated depreciation on fixed assets to be abandoned of approximately $98.7 million and (ii) severance and employee benefits of $6.2 million. We also expect to incur restructuring and other charges related to this phase out of approximately $20 to $30 million over the next two quarters primarily representing additional charges associated with fixed assets to be abandoned. Solutia legal settlement of $22.5 million in our Industrial Chemicals segment. This settlement was approved by the U.S. Bankruptcy Court in the Southern District of New York (where Solutia had filed for Chapter 11 bankruptcy protection in 2003) on May 1, 2007 without any appeal having been taken. 33 Table of Contents Asset abandonment charges of $12.2 million at Foret which is part of our Industrial Chemicals business. These charges include an impairment charge of $8.2 million related to a co-generation facility at Foret. This facility produced electric power and thermal energy by co-generation for use at one of Foret production properties. We recorded $1.8 million of charges related to an agreement to settle state court cases alleging violations of antitrust law involving our microcrystalline cellulose product ( MCC) in our Specialty Chemicals segment. $6.8 million of severance costs, of which $5.6 million related to our Industrial Chemicals segment and $1.2 million related to our Agricultural Products segment. $1.1 million of asset abandonment charges in our Industrial Chemicals segment and $3.4 million of other charges primarily in our Industrial Chemicals and Specialty Chemicals segments. $10.2 million relating to continuing environmental sites as a Corporate charge. The restructuring and other charges of $74.8 million that we recorded in 2006 were primarily a result of the following: We reached an agreement to settle a federal class action lawsuit, as well as other individual claims, alleging violations of antitrust laws involving our microcrystalline cellulose ( MCC ) product in our Specialty Chemicals business in the amount of $25.7 million. We committed to the abandonment of a plant building in our Agricultural Products segment and recorded a charge of $6.0 million. The European Commission imposed a fine on us regarding alleged violations of competition law in the hydrogen peroxide business in Europe during the period 1997-1999 which we have appealed. This fine is associated with our Industrial Chemicals segment. We have recorded a charge of 25 million ($30 million at then-prevailing exchange rates) charge for this fine. Since we are not required to make the payment during the appeal process, which may extend beyond one year, the liability has been classified as long-term in the consolidated balance sheets as of December 31, 2007 and 2006. We announced a plan to redeploy our discovery research and development resources within our Agricultural Products segment to shorten the innovation cycle and accelerate the delivery of new product and technologies. We incurred $3.4 million of severance charges as a result of this decision. These severance costs related to approximately 70 people who have separated from us. We also abandoned assets as a result of these decisions and recorded a charge of $1.9 million. Additional restructuring charges for 2006 totaled $7.8 million. These charges included $1.2 million of asset abandonment charges in our Industrial Chemicals segment and $1.3 million of severance costs were recorded in our Specialty Chemicals segment due to a workforce restructuring. We also recorded $5.4 million relating to continuing environmental sites. Offsetting these charges was a gain of $0.6 million in our Specialty Chemicals segment from the completion of the sale of our previously disclosed assets held for sale related to our Copenhagen, Denmark carrageenan plant which we closed in 2005. The gain represented the difference between the asset held for sale balance and the final proceeds. The final proceeds from the sale totaled $9.6 million. Additional restructuring and other charges were recorded in Industrial Chemicals for $0.5 million. Equity in (earnings) loss of affiliates was $2.5 million of earnings in 2007 which was essentially level with $2.3 million of earnings recorded in the prior year. Interest expense, net increased to $34.9 million compared to $32.9 million in 2006 primarily due to a reduction in interest income caused by lower cash balances. 34 Table of Contents Loss on extinguishment of debt was $0.3 million ($0.2 million after-tax) for the year ended December 31, 2007 which represented losses related to the write off of certain deferred financing fees related to our previous credit agreement which was replaced in the third quarter of 2007 with our new Domestic Credit Agreement. We did not incur any comparable charge for the year ended December 31, 2006. Provision for income taxes was $29.0 million in 2007 compared with $68.3 million in 2006 reflecting effective tax rates of 15.6% and 32.2%, respectively. The change in effective tax rates is the result of tax adjustments resulting in income in 2007 as opposed to tax adjustments resulting in expense in 2006. These tax adjustments are described below. The change in effective rates is also a result of the mix of domestic income compared to income earned outside the U.S. and the European Commission fine of 25 million ($30 million at then-prevailing exchange rates) incurred in 2006 that was nondeductible for tax purposes in 2006. 2007 tax adjustments were favorable in the amount of $15.4 million and primarily include tax benefits related to the reversal of certain tax valuation allowances. These valuation allowances are no longer necessary because of our expectation that the related deferred tax assets are now likely to be realized. Partially offsetting these valuation adjustments are charges associated with adjustments for prior year tax matters. 2006 tax adjustments were unfavorable in the amount of $12.5 million and primarily include charges associated with adjustments to deferred taxes. Discontinued operations, net of income tax totaled a loss of $24.3 million in 2007 versus a loss of $12.8 million in 2006. The 2007 loss is primarily related to environmental charges associated with our Middleport, Front Royal and Modesto sites and charges for legal reserves and expenses related to discontinued operations. Discontinued environmental and legal charges include environmental remediation costs at sites of discontinued businesses for which we are responsible for environmental compliance. The 2006 loss includes net charges of $27.3 million related to environmental issues and legal reserves and expenses related to previously discontinued operations. The charges in 2006 were primarily related to our Front Royal and Middleport sites as well as to increase reserves for operating and maintenance activities. Offsetting these charges was a gain of $14.0 million from the sale of 23 acres real estate property in San Jose, California related to our former Defense business. This completed the sale of land that was formerly used by FMC defense business, which was divested in 1997. Net Income increased to $132.4 million in 2007 compared with $131.3 million in 2006 primarily attributable to changes in the after-tax items included in net income described above. Additionally, net income in 2007 was favorably impacted by higher earnings in our Agricultural Products and Specialty Chemicals segments. Other Financial Data Corporate Expenses were $52.3 million in 2007 compared to $46.2 million in 2006, due to higher incentive compensation expenses. Other income (expense), net is comprised primarily of LIFO inventory adjustments and pension expense. Other expense increased to $12.0 million in the year ended December 31, 2007 compared to income of $3.0 million in the year ended December 31, 2006. During 2006 inventory balances were reduced in the U.S. due to liquidation of inventory quantities carried at lower costs as compared with the cost of 2006 purchases. This resulted in income recorded in 2006 related to a decrease in LIFO inventory reserves that did not repeat in 2007. Segment Results 2007 compared to 2006 Information about how each of these items relates to our businesses at the segment level and results by segment are discussed below and in Note 19 to our consolidated financial statements included in this Form 10-K. 35 Table of Contents Agricultural Products Year Ended December 31, Increase/ (Decrease) 2007 2006 $ % (in Millions) Revenue $ 889.7 $ 765.9 $ 123.8 16 % Operating Profit 207.0 149.9 57.1 38 Revenue in Agricultural Products was $889.7 million, an increase of 16 percent versus the prior year. Higher sales were realized in all geographic regions, but were particularly strong in Brazil due to increased planted acres in other key crops and higher commodity prices. Sales growth in Europe was driven by increased demand for biofuels crops, new product introductions and the benefits of the stronger Euro. In Asia, sales increased due to better growing conditions in several countries. Segment operating profit was $207.0 million, an increase of 38 percent from the year earlier, as a result of the higher sales and continued global supply chain productivity improvements, which more than offset higher incremental selling and distribution costs due to the increased sales and higher energy and raw materials costs. In 2008, full-year revenue growth is expected to be up 5-10 percent as a result of a healthy global agricultural economy, new product introductions and increased demand for biofuels. Full-year segment operating profit is expected to increase approximately 10-15 percent driven by the sales growth and further supply chain productivity improvements partially offset by higher raw material costs. In our Agricultural Products segment, several products are undergoing re-registration in the U.S. and a comparable regulatory review by EU governmental authorities. In August 2006, the U.S. Environmental Protection Agency issued its Interim Reregistration Eligibility Decision ( IRED ) for our carbofuran insecticide. The IRED proposes cancellation of all carbofuran uses in the United States, subject to a phase out period for certain minor crop uses. FMC does not agree with the scientific analysis or conclusions in the IRED. In early February 2008, the EPA convened a Scientific Advisory Panel meeting to evaluate scientific issues relevant to a draft Notice of Intent to Cancel Carbofuran prepared by EPA. At this meeting, EPA and FMC presented their views on the relevant scientific assessments of carbofuran. We are vigorously defending the U.S. registration and have conducted new studies to address EPA stated concerns; we will undertake other appropriate actions to seek to maintain carbofuran as a registered product. If EPA chooses to issue a final Notice of Intent to Cancel carbofuran after the Scientific Advisory Panel reports its recommendations to EPA, FMC plans to challenge such decision by requesting review by an administrative law judge. The outcomes of the Scientific Advisory Panel meeting and any administrative hearing are uncertain. FMC can continue to sell carbofuran in the United States at this time and through 2008. Sales can continue through the duration of any administrative hearing if a hearing takes place, it is not expected to conclude before December 31, 2008. In November 2006, the EU Commission Standing Committee on Animal Health and Food Chain voted not to include our carbofuran, carbosulfan and cadusafos products on the official list of active ingredients approved for continued sale in the EU. We believe the Committee decision was based on a flawed underlying scientific review, and we have initiated litigation against the European Food Safety Authority. In June 2007, the European Commission published its decisions not to include carbofuran, carbosulfan and cadusafos on the official list of active ingredients approved for continued sale in the European Union. The published decisions required EU Member States to de-register the products within 6 months, and so, FMC ceased its sales of these products in December 2007. The Commission decision requires that channel sales generally cease within 12 months afterwards. We disagree with the Commission and have initiated litigation in the European Community courts, seeking annulment of the carbofuran and carbosulfan decisions. We have re-submitted cadusafos for approval on the official list and plan to re-submit carbofuran and carbosulfan in parallel with our litigation. The outcome of these cases and our regulatory resubmissions is uncertain. We currently anticipate that lost sales attributable to 36 Table of Contents the cancellation of EU registrations for carbofuran, carbosulfan and cadusafos will have a modest negative impact in this region over the next few years, but we believe that growth in other products, new registrations and/or label expansions should offset such impact over time. We intend to defend vigorously all our products in the U.S. and EU regulatory processes. Several of FMC pesticide products will be reviewed in the ordinary course of regulatory programs during 2008 as part of the ongoing cycle of re-registration in countries around the world; this will include EU review of two of our pyrethroid insecticide products. Specialty Chemicals Year Ended December 31, Increase/ (Decrease) 2007 2006 $ % (in Millions) Revenue $ 659.5 $ 592.8 $ 66.7 11 % Operating Profit 142.7 118.8 23.9 20 Revenue in Specialty Chemicals was $659.5 million, an increase of 11 percent versus the prior year, driven by higher selling prices for primary lithium compounds and strong commercial performance in both pharmaceutical and food businesses in BioPolymer. Segment operating profit of $142.7 million increased 20 percent versus the prior year due to higher sales, improved mix, and continued productivity improvements, which more than offset increased raw material costs. In 2008, we expect full-year revenue growth in the mid-single digits due to higher volumes across the segment and higher selling prices in BioPolymer. Full-year segment operating profit growth in the low single digits is expected, as strong commercial performance in BioPolymer and the benefit of continued productivity improvements are expected to be mitigated by lower selling prices for primary lithium compounds and higher export taxes in Argentina. Industrial Chemicals Year Ended December 31, Increase/ (Decrease) 2007 2006 $ % (in Millions) Revenue $ 1,087.1 $ 990.9 $ 96.2 10 % Operating Profit 92.5 96.7 (4.2 ) (4 ) Revenue in Industrial Chemicals was $1,087.1 million, an increase of 10 percent versus the prior year as a result of higher selling prices for soda ash and volume growth across the segment. Segment operating profit of $92.5 million decreased 4 percent versus the prior year, due to higher energy and raw material costs across the segment and lower electricity selling prices in Spain in the first three quarters of the year, where Foret operates electricity cogeneration facilities and excess electricity is sold into the Spanish electrical grid. These higher costs more than offset the positive impact of higher sales. For 2008, we expect full-year revenue growth of 5-10 percent as a result of higher volumes and selling prices across all businesses, particularly in soda ash. Full-year segment operating profit is expected to be up 55-60 percent as aggregate price and volume benefits and improved power market conditions in Spain more than offset higher raw material costs. 37 Table of Contents A major factor affecting phosphorus products in Foret in 2008 will be raw material costs, particularly for phosphate rock, where prices have increased dramatically versus 2007. We purchase phosphate rock in Foret from Morocco. The escalation in phosphate rock prices has been driven by tight supply conditions. We intend to recover these raw material cost increases in Foret in the form of higher pricing. Results of Operations 2006 compared to 2005 In the following discussion, year refers to the year ended December 31, 2006 and prior year refers to the year ended December 31, 2005. Additionally, in the discussion below, please refer to our consolidated statements of income and our segment information from Note 19 included in Item 8 of this Form 10-K as well as the after-tax charges included in net income in the above table. All comparisons are between the periods unless otherwise noted. Revenue for the year ended December 31, 2006 was $2,345.9 million, an increase of 9 percent compared to the $2,146.0 million recorded in the prior year period. This increase was driven by higher sales in all of our segments, which are discussed separately below. In-Process Research and Development for the year ended December 31, 2006 was $2.0 million ($1.2 million after tax). See previous discussion under Results of Operations 2007 compared to 2006 which describes In-Process Research and Development charges. We did not incur any comparable charge for the year ended December 31, 2005. Restructuring and other charges were $74.8 million ($57.9 million after-tax) in 2006 compared to $40.4 million ($26.1 million after-tax) in 2005. Charges in this category for the year ended December 31, 2006 are primarily related to the 25 million fine ($30 million at then-prevailing exchange rates) in our Industrial Chemicals Segment, the MCC Legal Settlements of $25.7 million in our Specialty Chemicals segment, a $6.0 million charge for the abandonment of a building in our Agricultural Products segment and severance and asset abandonment charges of $5.2 million related to research and development redeployment in our Agricultural Products segment. We also incurred $5.4 million of charges related to continuing environmental sites as a Corporate charge. The charges of $40.4 million we recorded for the year ended December 31, 2005 primarily related to the $17.0 million for the closing of our carrageenan plant in Copenhagen, Denmark in our Specialty Chemicals segment, $5.4 million for the abandonment of certain assets in our Agricultural Products segment and $7.5 million for impairment and shutdown charges at our Spring Hill, West Virginia facility in our Industrial Chemicals segment. We also incurred charges of $6.1 million at our Pocatello site to increase reserves for demolition and other shutdown costs. Equity in (earnings) loss of affiliates was $2.3 million of earnings in 2006 versus $70.6 million of earnings in the prior year. The significant decrease was primarily the result of our sale of Astaris and substantially all of its assets in the fourth quarter of 2005. We recorded a gain from this sale of $57.7 million ($21.7 million after-tax). The decrease is also the result of income at Astaris up to the date of the asset sale in 2005. Investment gains for the year ended December 31, 2005 were due to the sale of our 50% equity method investment in Sibelco. We recorded a gain of $9.3 million ($2.4 million after-tax) in conjunction with this sale in our consolidated statement of income. There were no gains from the sale of investments for the year ended December 31, 2006. Interest expense, net decreased to $32.9 million compared to $58.1 million in 2005. The decrease primarily reflected lower interest costs and debt levels in the year ended December 31, 2006 compared to the prior year. The decreases were due to our debt refinancing in June 2005 and the redemption of the 10.25 percent Senior Notes in July 2005. 38 Table of Contents Loss on extinguishment of debt was $60.5 million ($37.4 million after-tax) in 2005. In 2005, in connection with our Industrial Revenue Bond refinancing, we incurred an approximately $2.1 million loss and in connection with entering into the 2005 Credit Agreement, we wrote off approximately $1.2 million of deferred financing fees associated with the previous agreement and $0.6 million of fees associated with the new agreement. Additionally, in 2005, we incurred a loss of $56.6 million associated with the redemption of the 10.25 percent Senior Notes. Provision for income taxes was $68.3 million in 2006 compared with $80.7 million in 2005 reflecting effective tax rates of 32.2% and 42.7%, respectively. The change was primarily due to higher tax adjustments in 2005 which include income taxes associated with the repatriations under the American Jobs Creation Act (AJCA). Tax adjustments are described separately below. Offsetting this decrease was the effect on the tax provision in 2006 from having the $30 million European Commission fine that is non-deductible for tax purposes. Excluding the effect of these tax adjustments and the non-deductibility of the European Commission fine, the change from 2005 to 2006 is primarily a result of the mix of domestic income compared to income earned outside of the U.S., dividends received from foreign operations and valuation allowance adjustments. 2006 tax adjustments of $12.5 million primarily include charges associated with adjustments to deferred taxes. 2005 tax adjustments of $21.7 million primarily include charges of $31.9 million associated with repatriations, net tax benefits of $19.2 million primarily related to agreement on certain prior year tax matters previously reserved and charges of $9.5 million associated with adjustments to deferred tax liabilities. Cumulative effect of change in accounting principle, net of income tax. On December 31, 2005, we adopted FASB Interpretation No. 47 Accounting for Conditional Asset Retirement Obligations . The cumulative effect of adoption was a charge of $0.5 million in 2005. Discontinued operations, net of income tax totaled a loss of $12.8 million in 2006 versus a gain of $6.1 million in 2005. The 2006 loss includes net charges of $27.3 million related to environmental issues and legal expenses related to previously discontinued operations. Discontinued environmental and legal charges include environmental remediation costs at sites of discontinued businesses for which we are responsible for environmental compliance. The charges in 2006 were primarily related to our Front Royal and Middleport sites as well as to increase reserves for operating and maintenance activities. Offsetting these charges was a gain of $14.0 million from the sale of 23 acres real estate property in San Jose, California related to our former Defense business. This completed the sale of land that was formerly used by FMC defense business, which was divested in 1997. The 2005 net gain included income of $29.2 million related to a sale to the city of San Jose, California of approximately 52 acres of land used by our former Defense Systems operations. Primarily offsetting this income in 2005 was net environmental and legal charges of $23.4 million. The charges in 2005 were primarily related to our Front Royal and Middleport sites and in recognition of our share of liabilities related to a consent order between the EPA and the primary responsible parties at the Anniston site. Net Income increased to $131.3 million in 2006 compared with $114.0 million in 2005 primarily as a result of changes in the after-tax items included in net income described above. The change in these items was the primary driver behind the increase in net income from 2005 to 2006 which was also due to higher earnings from our Agricultural Products, Specialty Chemicals and Industrial Chemicals segments and a decrease in interest expense. 39 Table of Contents Other Financial Data Corporate Expenses were $46.2 million in 2006 compared to $45.1 million in 2005, essentially level from the prior year. Other income and expense, net decreased to $3.0 million from $13.9 million in the prior year due to a gain related to the settlement of certain energy contracts in 2005 which was not repeated in 2006 as well as higher pension expense and the recognition of stock option expense in 2006. Offsetting these decreases was a gain recorded in 2006 related to a refund of previously submitted payroll taxes. Segment Results 2006 compared to 2005 Information about how each of these items relates to our businesses at the segment level and results by segment are discussed below and in Note 19 to our consolidated financial statements included in this Form 10-K. Agricultural Products Year Ended December 31, Increase/ (Decrease) 2006 2005 $ % (in Millions) Revenue $ 765.9 $ 720.3 $ 45.6 6 % Operating Profit 149.9 120.6 29.3 24 Revenue in Agricultural Products was $765.9 million in 2006, an increase of 6 percent versus 2005, driven primarily by strong sales growth in Latin America, particularly in Brazil, as well as by higher sales in North America and in Asia. Segment operating profit was $149.9 million in 2006, an increase of 24 percent from the year earlier, as a result of the higher sales and the favorable impact of supply chain productivity initiatives, which more than offset the impact of generic bifenthrin competition, higher raw material costs and increased spending associated with growth initiatives. Specialty Chemicals Year Ended December 31, Increase/ (Decrease) 2006 2005 $ % (in Millions) Revenue $ 592.8 $ 558.5 $ 34.3 6 % Operating Profit 118.8 108.1 10.7 10 Revenue in Specialty Chemicals was $592.8 million in 2006, an increase of 6 percent versus 2005, driven by higher sales of primary lithium compounds and continued strength in BioPolymer pharmaceutical business. Segment operating profit of $118.8 million in 2006 increased 10 percent versus 2005. The sales gains, improved results in BioPolymer food ingredients business and the benefit of restructuring initiatives were partially offset by higher raw material costs and increased spending for growth initiatives. 40 Table of Contents Industrial Chemicals Year Ended December 31, Increase/ (Decrease) 2006 2005 $ % (in Millions) Revenue $ 990.9 $ 870.4 $ 120.5 14 % Operating Profit 96.7 83.9 12.8 15 Revenue in Industrial Chemicals was $990.9 million in 2006, an increase of 14 percent versus 2005. The soda ash business accounted for the majority of the increase due to significant improvements in both domestic and export soda ash selling prices and higher volumes. North American hydrogen peroxide also benefited from higher selling prices and energy surcharges. Segment operating profit of $96.7 million increased 15 percent in 2006 versus 2005, driven by the sales gains, offset in part by higher energy costs, particularly for natural gas in Spain, higher raw material costs and the absence of earnings from Astaris, which was divested in November 2005. Prior to its divestiture, Astaris contributed approximately $11 million of income in 2005. Recently Adopted and Issued Accounting Pronouncements and Regulatory Items See Note 3 to our consolidated financial statements included in this Form 10-K. Liquidity and Capital Resources Domestic Credit Agreement Refinancing On August 28, 2007, we executed a new credit agreement (the Domestic Credit Agreement ) which provided for a five-year, $600 million revolving credit facility. The proceeds from this facility are available for general corporate purposes, including issuing letters of credit up to a $300 million sub-limit. The Domestic Credit Agreement also contains an option under which, subject to certain conditions, we may request an increase in the facility to $1 billion. There were no borrowings under the new facility at inception, and our prior credit agreement dated as of June 21, 2005 was terminated at that time. Obligations under the prior credit agreement and related transaction costs, fees, and expenses for the new Agreement were paid with available cash. Loans under the new facility bear interest at a floating rate, either a base rate as defined, or the applicable eurocurrency rate for the relevant term plus an applicable margin. The initial margin is 0.35 percent per year, subject to adjustment based on the credit rating assigned to our senior unsecured debt. At December 31, 2007, if we had borrowings under our Domestic Credit Agreement, then the applicable rate would have been 4.95 percent per annum. In connection with entering into the Domestic Credit Agreement, we wrote off $0.3 million of deferred financing fees associated with our previous credit agreement. These fees were previously a component of Other assets in our consolidated balance sheet and were recorded as Loss on extinguishment of debt in the consolidated statement of income for the year ended December 31, 2007. On February 21, 2008, we entered into Amendment No. 1 to the Domestic Credit Agreement (the Amendment ) among us, certain of our subsidiaries, each lender and issuing bank party thereto from time to time and Citibank, N.A. as administrative agent for the lenders thereunder. The Amendment amends the Domestic Credit Agreement by correcting minor technical flaws and conforming certain definitions to the European Credit Agreement described below. 41 Table of Contents European Credit Agreement On December 16, 2005, our Dutch finance subsidiary executed a credit agreement (the European Credit Agreement ) which provides for an unsecured revolving credit facility in the amount of 220 million. Borrowings may be denominated in euros or U.S. dollars. FMC and our Dutch finance subsidiary direct parent provide guarantees of amounts due under the European Credit Agreement. Loans under the European Credit Agreement bear interest at a eurocurrency base rate, which for loans denominated in euros is the Euro InterBank Offered Rate, and for loans denominated in dollars is London Interbank Offered Rate ( LIBOR ) in each case plus a margin. The applicable margin under our European Credit Agreement is subject to adjustment based on the rating assigned, to FMC by each of Moody and S&P. At December 31, 2007 the applicable margin was 0.35 percent and the applicable borrowing rate under the European Credit Agreement was 5.12 percent per annum. On February 21, 2008, our Dutch finance subsidiary agreed upon an amendment and restatement of its European Credit Agreement with the bank lenders party thereto and Citibank International PLC, as agent for the lenders, to conform the representations, warranties and covenants in the European Credit Agreement to those contained in the Domestic Credit Agreement. Among other restrictions, the Domestic Credit Agreement and the European Credit Agreement contain financial covenants applicable to FMC and its consolidated subsidiaries related to leverage (measured as the ratio of debt to adjusted earnings) and interest coverage (measured as the ratio of adjusted earnings to interest expense). We were in compliance with all covenants at December 31, 2007. At December 31, 2007 and 2006, we had $171.7 and $196.4 million in U.S. dollar equivalent revolving credit facility borrowings under the European Credit Agreement, resulting in available funds of $147.1 million and $91.7 million, respectively. We had no borrowings under our Domestic Credit Agreement at December 31, 2007 and 2006. Letters of credit outstanding under the Domestic Credit Agreement totaled $146.9 million and $144.5 million at December 31, 2007 and 2006, respectively. Available funds under the Domestic Credit Agreement were $453.1 million at December 31, 2007 and $455.5 million at December 31, 2006. Cash and cash equivalents at December 31, 2007 and 2006 were $75.5 million and $165.5 million, respectively. We had total debt of $545.2 million and $629.7 million at December 31, 2007 and 2006, respectively. This included $419.6 million and $523.5 million of long-term debt (excluding current portions of $77.7 million and $52.5 million) at December 31, 2007 and 2006, respectively. Short-term debt, which consists of foreign borrowings, decreased to $47.9 million at December 31, 2007 compared to $53.7 million at December 31, 2006. The $78.7 million decrease in total long-term debt at December 31, 2007 from December 31, 2006 was primarily due to the scheduled repayment of a maturing medium-term note and partial repayment of our European Credit Agreement offset by higher exchange rates for the euro against the U.S. dollar. Statement of Cash Flows Cash provided by operating activities was $314.7 million for 2007 compared to $307.2 million for 2006 and $199.6 million for 2005. The increase in cash provided by operating activities in 2007 compared to 2006 reflected higher earnings from continuing operations offset by an increase in inventories and accounts receivable balances. The increase in cash provided by operating activities in 2006 compared to 2005 reflected higher earnings from continuing operations and improved working capital management in inventories and accounts payable. These were partially offset by an increase in accounts receivable balances. 42 Table of Contents Cash required by operating activities of discontinued operations was $45.1 million for 2007 compared to cash required of $43.2 million and cash provided of $17.4 million in 2006 and 2005, respectively. The change in 2007 compared to 2006 was due to the absence of proceeds from the sale of land in San Jose, California partially offset by lower discontinued operations environmental spending. The change in 2006 compared to 2005 was due to higher environmental spending in 2006 and lower cash proceeds of $25.3 million from the sale of a portion of our San Jose property in 2006 as compared to similar proceeds of $56.1 million in 2005. The majority of the spending for our discontinued operations is for environmental remediation on discontinued sites. Discontinued environmental spending was $22.4 million in 2007 compared to $44.1 million in 2006 and $24.4 million in 2005. Cash required by investing activities was $120.6 million, $109.8 million and $6.4 million for the years ended December 31, 2007, 2006 and 2005, respectively. The increase in cash required in 2007 was a result of lower proceeds from the sales and returns of investments and assets held for sale and an increase in other investing activities which represents increases to long-term deferred costs. The increase in cash required in 2006 was a result of lower asset sale proceeds, primarily attributable to the asset sale of our former phosphorus joint venture, Astaris, which took place in 2005. Cash required by financing activities for 2007 was $243.4 million compared to cash required of $198.5 million in 2006 and cash required by financing activities of $215.3 million in 2005. The increase in 2007 compared to 2006 was primarily due to higher repurchases of common stock and lower proceeds from the issuances of common stock which primarily represent cash received from the exercise of stock options. The decrease in 2006 compared to 2005 was primarily due to the higher redemption of long-term debt in 2005. Partially offsetting this change was the repurchase of $92.2 million of common stock and the payment of $21.0 million in dividends in 2006. We did not repurchase any common stock or pay any dividends in 2005. For the years ended December 31, 2007, 2006 and 2005, we contributed approximately 2,000, 470,000 and 528,000 shares of treasury stock to our employee benefit plans having a cost of $0.1 million, $17.3 million and $14.9 million, respectively, which is considered a non-cash activity. Commitments and other potential liquidity needs Our cash needs for 2008 include operating cash requirements, capital expenditures, scheduled mandatory payments of long-term debt, dividend payments, environmental spending and restructuring. We plan to meet our liquidity needs through available cash, cash generated from operations and borrowings under our $600 million committed revolving credit facility. We continually evaluate our options for divesting real estate holdings and property, plant and equipment that are no longer integral to any of our core operating businesses. Projected 2008 spending includes approximately $34 million of environmental remediation spending. This spending does not include expected spending of approximately $20 million in 2008 on capital projects relating to environmental control facilities. Also, we expect to spend in the range of approximately $26 million to $27 million in 2008 for environmental compliance costs, which we will include as a component of cost of sales in our consolidated statements of income since these amounts are not covered by established reserves. Capital spending to expand, maintain or replace equipment at our production facilities may trigger requirements for upgrading our environmental controls, which may increase our spending for environmental controls above the foregoing projections. We have historically made voluntary pension payments and plan to make such payments totaling approximately $30 million in 2008. 43 Table of Contents In 2006, the Board of Directors approved the initiation of a quarterly cash dividend of $0.09 per share which was paid in April, July, and October of 2006, and January of 2007. In April 2007, the Board announced its plan to increase the quarterly dividend by 17 percent from $0.09 to $0.105 per share. We declared dividends aggregating $30.9 million to our shareholders of record during the year 2007, and $7.9 million of this amount is included in Accrued and other liabilities on the consolidated balance sheet as of December 31, 2007. In 2006, the Board of Directors also authorized the repurchase of up to $150 million of our common stock. In April 2007, a new $250 million authorization was announced, replacing the original $150 million program. Although the new repurchase program does not include a specific timetable or price targets and may be suspended or terminated at any time, we expect the program will be accomplished over the next two years. During the year ended December 31, 2007, we repurchased 2,474,839 of our shares at an aggregate cost of approximately $110 million, including 536,422 shares for approximately $20 million under the old program and 1,938,417 shares for approximately $90 million under the new program. We also reacquire shares from time to time in connection with the vesting and exercise of awards under our equity compensation plans. See Note 1 to the consolidated financial statements in this Form 10-K for information regarding the stock split. In 2001, we split FMC into separate chemical and machinery companies and we refer to the spun-off company, FMC Technologies, Inc. as Technologies throughout this Annual Report. We agreed to guarantee the performance by Technologies of a debt instrument (see Note 18 to the consolidated financial statements in this Form 10-K). As of December 31, 2007, these guaranteed obligations totaled $1.6 million compared to $2.4 million at December 31, 2006. We guarantee repayment of some of the borrowings of certain foreign subsidiaries accounted for using the equity method. The other equity owners provide parallel agreements. We also guarantee the repayment of a borrowing of a minority equity holder in a foreign subsidiary that we consolidate in our financial statements. As of December 31, 2007 and 2006, these guarantees had maximum potential payments of $6.9 million and $8.2 million, respectively. We also provide guarantees to financial institutions on behalf of certain Agricultural Product customers, principally in Brazil, for their seasonal borrowing. The total of these guarantees was $29.7 million and $25.6 million at December 31, 2007 and 2006, respectively and are recorded on the consolidated balance sheets for each date as Guarantees of vendor financing . Short-term debt consisted of foreign credit lines at December 31, 2007 and December 31, 2006. We provide parent-company guarantees to lending institutions providing credit to our foreign subsidiaries. Our total significant committed contracts that we believe will affect cash over the next four years and beyond are as follows: Contractual Commitments Expected Cash Payments by Year 2008 2009 2010 2011 2012 & beyond Total (in Millions) Debt maturities (1) $ 125.6 $ 2.1 $ 184.2 $ 50.8 $ 183.0 $ 545.7 Contractual interest (2) 25.5 23.4 22.9 12.1 206.0 289.9 Lease obligations (3) 28.8 27.6 25.7 22.3 108.9 213.3 Forward energy and foreign exchange contracts 3.4 (0.2 ) 3.2 Purchase obligations (4) 25.9 8.0 4.1 4.2 7.4 49.6 Total (5) $ 209.2 $ 60.9 $ 236.9 $ 89.4 $ 505.3 $ 1,101.7 (1) Excluding discounts. 44 Table of Contents (2) Contractual interest is the interest we are contracted to pay on our long-term debt obligations. We had $213.2 million of long-term debt subject to variable interest rates at December 31, 2007. The rate assumed for the variable interest component of the contractual interest obligation was the rate in effect at December 31, 2007. Variable rates are market determined and will fluctuate over time. (3) Before recoveries. (4) Purchase obligations consist of agreements to purchase goods and services that are enforceable and legally binding on us and specify all significant terms, including fixed or minimum quantities to be purchased, price provisions and timing of the transaction. We have entered into a number of purchase obligations for the sourcing of materials and energy where take-or-pay arrangements apply. Since the majority of the minimum obligations under these contracts are take-or pay commitments over the life of the contract as opposed to a year by year take-or-pay, the obligations in the table related to these types of contacts are presented in the earliest period in which the minimum obligation could be payable under these types of contracts. (5) As of December 31, 2007, the liability for uncertain tax positions was $49.4 million and this liability is excluded from the table above. Due to the high degree of uncertainty regarding the timing of potential future cash flows associated with these liabilities, we are unable to make a reasonable reliable estimate of the amount and period in which these liabilities might be paid. Contingencies When FMC Technologies, Inc. was spun off from us in 2001, we entered into a tax sharing agreement wherein each company is obligated for those taxes associated with its respective business, generally determined as if each company filed its own consolidated, combined or unitary tax returns for any period where Technologies is included in the consolidated, combined or unitary tax return of us or our subsidiaries. The statute of limitations for the 2001 U.S. federal income tax year has now closed and no questions regarding the spin-off were raised during the IRS audit for 2000-2001, therefore any liability for taxes if the spin-off of Technologies were not tax free due to an action taken by Technologies has been favorably concluded. The tax sharing agreement continues to be in force with respect to certain items, which we do not believe would have a material effect on our financial condition or results of operations. On January 28, 2005 we and our wholly owned subsidiary Foret received a Statement of Objections from the European Commission concerning alleged violations of competition law in the hydrogen peroxide business in Europe during the period 1994 to 2001. All of the significant European hydrogen peroxide producers also received the Statement of Objections. We and Foret responded to the Statement of Objections in April 2005 and a hearing on the matter was held at the end of June 2005. On May 3, 2006, we received a notice from the European Commission indicating that the Commission has imposed a fine on us in the amount of 25.0 million as a result of alleged violations during the period 1997-1999. In connection with this fine, we recorded an expense of $30.0 million in our consolidated statements of income, reflecting then-prevailing exchange rates. This expense is included as a component of restructuring and other charges for 2006. Both we and Foret have appealed the decision of the Commission. During the appeal process, interest accrues on the fine at a rate of 4.1 percent per annum. We have provided a bank letter of credit in favor of the European Commission to guarantee our payment of the fine and accrued interest. At December 31, 2007, the amount of the letter of credit was 27.1 million ($39.3 million). We also received a subpoena in 2004 for documents from a grand jury sitting in the Northern District of California, which is investigating anticompetitive conduct in the hydrogen peroxide business in the United States during the period 1994 through 2003. In connection with these two matters, in February 2005 putative class action complaints were filed against all of the U.S. hydrogen peroxide producers in various federal courts alleging violations of antitrust laws. Federal law provides that persons who have been injured by violations of federal antitrust law may recover three times their actual damage plus attorney fees. Related cases were also filed in various state courts. All of the federal court cases were consolidated in the United States District Court for the Eastern District of Pennsylvania (Philadelphia). The District Court certified the class in January 2007, which the defendants have appealed. In early summer 2007, co-defendant Degussa agreed to a settlement in the federal 45 Table of Contents cases in the amount of $21 million which has received final Court approval. Two other co-defendants, Akzo Nobel and Kemira, have reached settlements in the amount of $23.4 million and $5.0 million respectively. Both settlements have received preliminary approval from the Court. The Akzo Nobel settlement has been approved by the Court, but the Kemira settlement remains subject to Court approval. Most of the state court cases have been dismissed, although some remain in California. In addition, putative class actions have been filed in provincial courts in Ontario, Quebec and British Columbia under the laws of Canada. Another antitrust class action previously brought in Federal Court in the Eastern District of Pennsylvania alleging violations of antitrust laws involving our microcrystalline cellulose product was settled for $25.0 million, the same amount paid by our co-defendant Asahi Kasei Corporation. The Court approved this settlement in November 2006. The claims of plaintiffs who opted out of the class settlement were also settled late in 2006 for $0.7 million. The above amounts for 2006 have been reflected in Restructuring and other charges in our consolidated statement of income for the year ended December 31, 2006. The parties have also reached an agreement to settle a related state court case pending in California, for a total of $2.5 million, with the Company and Asahi Kasei each contributing $1.25 million. This settlement was approved by the California state court in November 2007. A third related state court case remains pending against FMC in Tennessee, although the parties have reached a tentative agreement to settle the case for $0.5 million, which will be subject to Tennessee state court approval. The above amounts for 2007 have been reflected in Restructuring and other charges in our consolidated statement of income for the year ended December 31, 2007. We have certain other contingent liabilities arising from litigation, claims, performance guarantees and other commitments incident to the ordinary course of business. Based on information currently available and established reserves the ultimate resolution of our known contingencies, including the matters described in Note 18 to the consolidated financial statements, is not expected to have a material adverse effect on our consolidated financial position or liquidity. However, there can be no assurance that the outcome of these contingencies will be favorable, and adverse results in certain of these contingencies could have a material adverse effect on our consolidated financial position, results of operations or liquidity. Off-Balance Sheet Arrangements We do not have any significant off-balance sheet arrangements that are reasonably likely to have a current or future effect on our financial condition, results of operations, liquidity, capital expenditures or capital resources. Dividends In 2006, the Board of Directors approved the initiation of a quarterly cash dividend of $0.09 per share which was paid in April, July, and October of 2006, and January and April of 2007. In April 2007, the Board announced its plan to increase the quarterly dividend by 17 percent from $0.09 to $0.105 per share. We declared dividends aggregating $30.9 million to our shareholders of record during the year 2007, and $7.9 million of this amount is included in Accrued and other liabilities on the consolidated balance sheet as of December 31, 2007. Total cash dividends of $29.7 million and $21.0 million were paid in 2007 and 2006, respectively, and no cash dividends were paid in 2005.
