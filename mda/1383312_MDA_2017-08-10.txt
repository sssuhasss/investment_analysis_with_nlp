These financial statements present the consolidated position of the Company and include the entities in which the Company directly or indirectly has a controlling financial interest as well as various entities in which the Company has investments recorded under either the cost or equity methods of accounting. Intercompany balances and transactions have been eliminated. Amounts presented may not sum due to rounding. In presenting the Consolidated Financial Statements, management makes estimates and assumptions that affect the amounts reported and related disclosures. Management continually evaluates the accounting policies and estimates used to prepare the Consolidated Financial Statements. The estimates, by their nature, are based on judgment, available information, and historical experience and are believed to be reasonable. However, actual amounts and results could differ from those estimates made by management. In management opinion, the Consolidated Financial Statements contain all normal recurring adjustments necessary for a fair presentation of results reported. The results of operations reported for the periods presented are not necessarily indicative of the results of operations for subsequent periods. Effective in the first quarter of fiscal year 2017, we have revised our presentation in the Consolidated Statements of Earnings to separately present Interest expense, net. Previously, Interest expense, net, was reported as part of Non-operating expenses, net, and was not separately presented in the Consolidated Statements of Earnings. All prior period information has been conformed to the current period presentation. See Note 4, Interest Expense, Net, to our Consolidated Financial Statements under Item 8 of Part II of this Annual report on Form 10-K for details of the Company Interest expense, net, Note 5, Other Non-Operating (Income) Expenses, Net, to our Consolidated Financial Statements under Item 8 of Part II of this Annual report on Form 10-K for details of the Company Other non-operating (income) expenses, net, and Note 19, Quarterly Financial Results (Unaudited), to our Consolidated Financial Statements under Item 8 of Part II of this Annual report on Form 10-K for details of our Operating income. Effective in the first quarter of fiscal year 2017, the Company adopted Financial Accounting Standards Board ( FASB ) Accounting Standards Update ( ASU ) No. 2015-03, Simplifying the Presentation of Debt Issuance Costs ( ASU No. 2015-03 ), which requires that debt issuance costs related to a recognized debt liability be presented in the balance sheet as a direct deduction from the carrying amount of that debt liability, consistent with debt discounts. The Company has applied this guidance on a retrospective basis and accordingly, the Consolidated Balance Sheet under Item 8 of Part II of this Annual report on Form 10-K as of June 30, 2016 has been updated to reflect this new classification, which resulted in a decrease in Other non-current assets of $7.1 million, a decrease in Long-term debt, excluding current portion of $7.0 million and a decrease of $0.1 million in Current portion of long-term debt at June 30, 2016 . CRITICAL ACCOUNTING POLICIES We continually evaluate the accounting policies and estimates used to prepare the Consolidated Financial Statements. The estimates, by their nature, are based on judgment, available information, and historical experience and are believed to be reasonable. However, actual amounts and results could differ from these estimates made by management. Certain accounting policies that require significant management estimates and are deemed critical to our results of operations or financial position are discussed below. Goodwill . We review the carrying value of all our goodwill by comparing the carrying value of our reporting units to their fair values. We are required to perform this comparison at least annually or more frequently if circumstances indicate a possible impairment. When determining fair value of a reporting unit, we utilize the income approach which considers future cash flows using various assumptions, including projections of revenues based on assumed long-term growth rates, estimated costs and appropriate discount rates based on the particular reporting unit weighted-average cost of capital. The principal factors used in the discounted cash flow analysis requiring judgment are the projected future operating cash flows, the weighted-average cost of capital and the terminal value growth rate assumptions. The weighted-average cost of capital takes into account the relative weight of each component of our consolidated capital structure (equity and long-term debt). Our estimates of long-term growth and costs are based on historical data, various internal estimates and a variety of external sources, and are developed as part of our routine, long-range planning process. Changes in economic and operating conditions impacting these assumptions could result in goodwill impairments in future periods. We had $1,159.3 million of goodwill as of June 30, 2017 . Given the significance of our goodwill, an adverse change to the fair value of one of our reporting units could result in an impairment charge, which could be material to our earnings. The Company performs a sensitivity analysis under Step 1 of the goodwill impairment test assuming hypothetical reductions in the fair values of our reporting units. A 10% change in our estimates of projected future operating cash flows, 29 discount rates, or terminal value growth rates used in our calculations of the fair values of the reporting units would not result in an impairment of our goodwill. Income Taxes . The objectives of accounting for income taxes are to recognize the amount of taxes payable or refundable for the current year and deferred tax liabilities and assets for the future tax consequences of events that have been recognized in an entity financial statements or tax returns. Judgment is required in addressing the future tax consequences of events that have been recognized in our Consolidated Financial Statements or tax returns (e.g., realization of deferred tax assets, changes in tax laws or interpretations thereof). The Company is subject to regular examination of its income tax returns by the U.S. federal, state and foreign tax authorities. A change in the assessment of the outcomes of such matters could materially impact our Consolidated Financial Statements. The Company has estimated foreign net operating loss carryforwards of approximately $14.8 million as of June 30, 2017 of which $1.3 million expires in 2018 through 2027 and of which $13.5 million has an indefinite utilization period. In addition, the Company has estimated U.S. federal net operating loss carryforwards of approximately $26.4 million, which expire in 2018 through 2030. Valuation allowances are recognized to reduce deferred tax assets when it is more likely than not that the Company will not be able to utilize the deferred tax assets attributable to net operating and capital loss carryforwards of certain subsidiaries to offset future taxable earnings. The Company has recorded valuation allowances of $9.3 million and $9.8 million at June 30, 2017 and 2016 , respectively. The determination as to whether a deferred tax asset will be recognized is made on a jurisdictional basis and is based on the evaluation of historical taxable income or loss, projected future taxable income, carryforward periods, scheduled reversals of deferred tax liabilities and tax planning strategies. Projected future taxable income is based on expected results and assumptions as to the jurisdiction in which the income will be earned. The assumptions used to project future taxable income requires significant judgment and are consistent with the plans and estimates used to manage the underlying businesses. Share-based Payments . Accounting for stock-based compensation requires the measurement of stock-based compensation expense based on the fair value of the award on the date of grant. We determine the fair value of stock options issued by using a binomial option-pricing model. The binomial option-pricing model considers a range of assumptions related to volatility, dividend yield, risk-free interest rate and employee exercise behavior. Expected volatilities utilized in the binomial option-pricing model are based on a combination of implied market volatilities, historical volatility of our stock price and other factors. Similarly, the dividend yield is based on historical experience and expected future changes. The risk-free rate is derived from the U.S. Treasury yield curve in effect at the time of grant. The binomial option-pricing model also incorporates exercise and forfeiture assumptions based on an analysis of historical data. The expected life of the stock option grants is derived from the output of the binomial model and represents the period of time that options granted are expected to be outstanding. Determining these assumptions are subjective and complex, and therefore, a change in the assumptions utilized could impact the calculation of the fair value of our stock options. A hypothetical change of five percentage points applied to the volatility assumption used to determine the fair value of the fiscal year 2017 stock option grants would result in approximately a $1.6 million change in total pre-tax stock-based compensation expense for the fiscal year 2017 grants, which would be amortized over the vesting period. A hypothetical change of one year in the expected life assumption used to determine the fair value of the fiscal year 2017 stock option grants would result in approximately a $0.5 million change in the total pre-tax stock-based compensation expense for the fiscal year 2017 grants, which would be amortized over the vesting period. A hypothetical change of one percentage point in the forfeiture rate assumption used for the fiscal year 2017 stock option grants would result in approximately a $0.1 million change in the total pre-tax stock-based compensation expense for the fiscal year 2017 grants, which would be amortized over the vesting period. A hypothetical one-half percentage point change in the dividend yield assumption used to determine the fair value of the fiscal year 2017 stock option grants would result in approximately a $0.7 million change in the total pre-tax stock-based compensation expense for the fiscal year 2017 grants, which would be amortized over the vesting period. RESULTS OF OPERATIONS The following discussions of Analysis of Consolidated Statements of Earnings and Analysis of Reportable Segments refer to the fiscal year ended June 30, 2017 compared to the fiscal year ended June 30, 2016 , and the fiscal year ended June 30, 2016 compared to the fiscal year ended June 30, 2015 . The Analysis of Consolidated Statements of Earnings should be read in conjunction with the Analysis of Reportable Segments, which provides more detailed discussions concerning certain components of the Consolidated Statements of Earnings. The following references are utilized in the discussions of Analysis of Consolidated Statements of Earnings and Analysis of Reportable Segments: 30 Amortization of Acquired Intangibles and Purchased Intellectual Property and Acquisition and Integration Costs represent certain non-cash amortization expenses associated with acquired intangible assets and purchased intellectual property assets, and certain transaction and integration costs associated with the Company acquisition activities, respectively. Net New Business refers to recurring revenue from closed sales less recurring revenue from client losses. The following definitions describe the Company Revenues: Fee revenues in the Investor Communication Solutions segment are derived from both recurring and event-driven activity. In addition, the level of recurring and event-driven activity we process directly impacts distribution revenues. While event-driven activity is highly repeatable, it may not recur on an annual basis. The types of services we provide that comprise event-driven activity are: Mutual Fund Proxy: The proxy and related services we provide to mutual funds when certain events occur requiring a shareholder vote including changes in directors, sub-advisors, fee structures, investment restrictions, and mergers of funds. Mutual Fund Communications: Mutual fund communications services consist primarily of the distribution on behalf of mutual funds of supplemental information required to be provided to the annual mutual fund prospectus as a result of certain triggering events such as a change in portfolio managers. In addition, mutual fund communications consist of notices and marketing materials such as newsletters. Proxy Contests and Specials, Corporate Actions, and Other: The proxy services we provide in connection with shareholder meetings driven by special events such as proxy contests, mergers and acquisitions, and tender/exchange offers. Event-driven fee revenues are based on the number of special events and corporate transactions we process. Event-driven activity is impacted by financial market conditions and changes in regulatory compliance requirements, resulting in fluctuations in the timing and levels of event-driven fee revenues. As such, the timing and level of event-driven activity and its potential impact on revenues and earnings are difficult to forecast. Generally, mutual fund proxy activity has been subject to a greater level of volatility than the other components of event-driven activity. During fiscal year 2017 , mutual fund proxy fee revenues were 19% higher than the prior fiscal year while during fiscal years 2016 and 2015 , mutual fund proxy revenues were 22% higher and 2% lower than the prior fiscal year, respectively. Although it is difficult to forecast the levels of event-driven activity, we expect that the portion of fee revenues derived from mutual fund proxy activity may continue to experience volatility in the future. Distribution revenues primarily include revenues related to the physical mailing of proxy materials, interim communications, transaction reporting, customer communications and fulfillment services as well as Matrix administrative services. Distribution cost of revenues consists primarily of postage-related expenses incurred in connection with our Investor Communication Solutions segment, as well as Matrix administrative services expenses. These costs are reflected in Cost of revenues. Closed sales represent an estimate of the expected annual recurring fee revenue for new client contracts that were signed by Broadridge in the current reporting period. Closed sales does not include event-driven or distribution activity. We consider contract terms, expected client volumes or activity, knowledge of the marketplace and experience with our clients, among other factors, when determining the estimate. Management uses Closed sales to measure the effectiveness of our sales and marketing programs, as an indicator of expected future revenues and as a performance metric in determining incentive compensation. Closed sales is not a measure of financial performance under GAAP, and should not be considered in isolation or as a substitute for revenue or other income statement data prepared in accordance with GAAP. Closed sales is a useful metric for investors in understanding how management measures and evaluates our ongoing operational performance. The inherent variability of transaction volumes and activity levels can result in some variability of amounts reported as actual achieved Closed sales. For fiscal years prior to fiscal year 2017, we tracked actual revenues achieved during the first year that the client contract was fully implemented and compared this to the previously reported Closed sales amount, this process was used to calibrate metrics used in incentive compensation and will be used to estimate future allowance adjustments. Larger Closed sales can take up to 12 to 24 months or longer to convert to revenues, particularly for the services provided by our Global Technology and Operations segment. 31 Beginning in the fiscal year ended June 30, 2017, we have reported Closed sales net of a 3.5% allowance adjustment, in lieu of our previous practice of adjusting for actual performance in subsequent periods. Consequently, our reported Closed sales amounts will not be adjusted for actual revenues achieved because these adjustments are estimated in the period the sale is reported. The allowance adjustment was determined by reviewing the reported Closed sales amounts for the prior five fiscal years based on estimated revenues at signing and comparing those amounts to the revenues achieved one year after the clients went live on the services. Cumulatively during the five years from fiscal year 2012 through fiscal year 2016, we reported Closed sales of $689.3 million based on estimates at signing, while revenues achieved one year after go-live were $665.2 million, resulting in revaluation losses of $24.1 million or a realized loss experience of 3.5%. We will assess this allowance amount at the end of each fiscal year to establish the appropriate allowance for the subsequent year using the trailing five years data referenced earlier as the starting point, normalized for outlying factors, if any, to enhance the accuracy of the allowance. For the fiscal years ended June 30, 2017, 2016 and 2015, Closed sales, which includes contributions from NACC in fiscal year 2017, were $188.5 million , $150.9 million and $146.4 million , respectively. The fiscal year ended June 30, 2017 is net of an allowance adjustment of $6.8 million.

Revenues from acquisitions contributed $1,092.1 million of this total increase, with NACC revenues contributing $1,067.1 million. The $1,245.5 million increase was driven by an increase in distribution revenues of $690.2 million, or 80%, which includes $642.9 million of NACC distribution revenues, and an increase in recurring fee revenues of $555.9 million, or 29%. The higher recurring fee revenues of $555.9 million reflected: contributions from our recent acquisitions (24 pts), including $424.2 million from the NACC acquisition, gains from Net New Business (4 pts) and internal growth (2 pts). Event-driven revenues increased by $19.5 million, or 10%. Fluctuations in foreign currency exchange rates negatively impacted total revenues by $20.1 million. Total operating expenses .

Operating income margins decreased to 12.8% for the fiscal year ended June 30, 2017 , compared to 17.3% for the fiscal year ended June 30, 2016 , primarily due to the acquisition of NACC. Interest expense, net. Interest expense, net for the fiscal year ended June 30, 2017 was $42.7 million , an increase of $16.9 million, or 66% , compared to $25.7 million for the fiscal year ended June 30, 2016 . The increase was primarily due to an increase in interest expense of $16.3 million from higher Long-term borrowings. Other non-operating (income) expenses, net. Other non-operating expenses, net for the fiscal year ended June 30, 2017 were $0.8 million , a decrease of $4.9 million , or 86% , compared to $5.6 million of Other non-operating expenses, net for the fiscal year ended June 30, 2016 , primarily due to the $9.3 million MAL investment gain, partially offset by higher expense of $4.3 million related to fluctuations in foreign currency exchange rates. Earnings before income taxes . Earnings before income taxes for the fiscal year ended June 30, 2017 were $488.1 million , an increase of $19.2 million , or 4% , compared to $468.9 million for the fiscal year ended June 30, 2016 . Provision for income taxes .

The effective tax for the fiscal year ended June 30, 2017 was impacted by the recognition of the non-cash, nontaxable $9.3 million MAL investment gain. Excluding that investment gain, the effective tax rate for the fiscal year ended June 30, 2017 was 33.7%. In addition to the tax benefit from the MAL investment gain, the effective tax rate also declined as a result of a $2.2 million increase in the current year accrual for the Section 199 domestic production activities deduction relating to prior tax years.

ANALYSIS OF REPORTABLE SEGMENTS Broadridge has two reportable business segments: (1) Investor Communication Solutions and (2) Global Technology and Operations. The primary component of Other are certain gains, losses, corporate overhead expenses and non-operating expenses that have not been allocated to the reportable segments, such as interest expense. Foreign currency exchange is a reconciling item between the actual foreign currency exchange rates and the constant foreign currency exchange rates used for internal management reporting. Certain corporate expenses, as well as certain centrally managed expenses, are allocated based upon budgeted amounts in a reasonable manner. Because the Company compensates the management of its various businesses on, among other factors, segment profit, the Company may elect to record certain segment-related operating and non-operating expense items in Other rather than reflect such items in segment profit.

In certain circumstances, results have been presented that are not generally accepted accounting principles measures ( Non-GAAP ). These Non-GAAP measures are Adjusted Operating income, Adjusted Net earnings, Adjusted earnings per share, and Free cash flow. These Non-GAAP financial measures should be viewed in addition to, and not as a substitute for, the Company reported results. The Company believes our Non-GAAP financial measures help investors understand how management plans, measures and evaluates the Company business performance. Management believes that Non-GAAP measures provide consistency in its financial reporting and facilitates investors understanding of the Company operating results and trends by providing an additional basis for comparison. Management uses these Non-GAAP financial measures to, among other things, evaluate our ongoing operations, for internal planning and forecasting purposes and in the calculation of performance-based compensation. In addition, and as a consequence of the importance of these Non-GAAP financial measures in managing our business, the Company Compensation Committee of the Board of Directors incorporates Non-GAAP financial measures in the evaluation process for determining management compensation. Adjusted Operating Income, Adjusted Net Earnings and Adjusted Earnings Per Share These Non-GAAP measures reflect Operating income, Operating income margin, Net earnings, and Diluted earnings per share, as adjusted to exclude the impact of certain costs, expenses, gains and losses and other specified items that management believes are not indicative of our ongoing operating performance. These adjusted measures exclude the impact of Amortization of Acquired Intangibles and Purchased Intellectual Property, Acquisition and Integration Costs and the MAL investment gain. Amortization of Acquired Intangibles and Purchased Intellectual Property represents non-cash expenses associated with the Company's acquisition activities. Acquisition and Integration Costs represent certain transaction and integration costs associated with the Company acquisition activities. We exclude Amortization of Acquired Intangibles and Purchased Intellectual Property, Acquisition and Integration Costs and the MAL investment gain from these measures because excluding such information provides us with an understanding of the results from the primary operations of our business and these items do not reflect ordinary operations or earnings. Management believes these measures may be useful to an investor in evaluating the underlying operating performance of our business. Free Cash Flows In addition to the Non-GAAP financial measures discussed above, we provide Free cash flow information because we consider Free cash flow to be a liquidity measure that provides useful information to management and investors about the amount of cash generated that could be used for dividends, share repurchases, strategic acquisitions and other discretionary investments. Free cash flow is a Non-GAAP financial measure and is defined by the Company as Net cash flows provided by operating activities less Capital expenditures as well as Software purchases and capitalized internal use software. Set forth below is a reconciliation of such Non-GAAP measures to the most directly comparable GAAP measures (unaudited): Years ended June 30, 2017 2016 2015 (in millions) Operating income (GAAP) $ 531.6 $ 500.3 $ 466.9 Adjustments: Amortization of Acquired Intangibles and Purchased Intellectual Property 72.6 31.8 25.3 Acquisition and Integration Costs 19.1 5.0 5.0 Adjusted Operating income (Non-GAAP) $ 623.3 $ 537.1 $ 497.2 38 Years ended June 30, 2017 2016 2015 (in millions) Net earnings (GAAP) $ 326.8 $ 307.5 $ 287.1 Adjustments: Amortization of Acquired Intangibles and Purchased Intellectual Property 72.6 31.8 25.3 Acquisition and Integration Costs 19.1 5.0 5.0 MAL investment gain (a) (9.3 ) Tax impact of adjustments (30.9 ) (12.7 ) (10.5 ) Adjusted Net earnings (Non-GAAP) $ 378.3 $ 331.7 $ 306.9 (a) Represents a non-cash, nontaxable gain on investment.

Total stockholders equity was $1,003.8 million and $1,045.5 million at June 30, 2017 and 2016 , respectively. At June 30, 2017 , net working capital was $244.6 million , compared to $596.2 million at June 30, 2016 . At the current time, and in future periods, we expect cash generated by our operations, together with existing cash, cash equivalents, and borrowing capacity to be sufficient to cover cash needs for working capital, capital expenditures, acquisitions, dividends and common stock repurchases. 39 As of June 30, 2017 , $126.2 million of the $271.1 million of Cash and cash equivalents was held by our foreign subsidiaries, and $58.1 million of Cash and cash equivalents was held by regulated entities. We expect existing domestic cash, cash equivalents, and cash flows from operations together with borrowing capacity to continue to be sufficient to fund our domestic operating activities and cash commitments for investing and financing activities, such as regular quarterly dividends, debt repayment schedules, and material capital expenditures, for at least the next 12 months and thereafter for the foreseeable future. In addition, we expect existing foreign cash, cash equivalents, cash flows from operations and borrowing capacity to continue to be sufficient to fund our foreign operating activities and cash commitments for investing activities, such as material capital expenditures, for at least the next 12 months and thereafter for the foreseeable future. If these funds are needed for our operations in the U.S., we would be required to accrue and pay U.S. taxes to repatriate these funds. However, our current plans do not demonstrate a need to repatriate them to fund our U.S. operations, as we consider these funds to be permanently reinvested outside the U.S. Outstanding borrowings and available capacity under the Company borrowing arrangements were as follows: Expiration Date Par value at June 30, 2017 Carrying value at June 30, 2017 Carrying value at June 30, 2016 (a) Unused Available Capacity Fair Value at June 30, 2017 (in millions) Current portion of long-term debt Fiscal 2007 Senior Notes June 2017 $ $ $ 124.8 $ $ $ $ $ 124.8 $ $ Long-term debt, excluding current portion Fiscal 2017 Revolving Credit Facility February 2022 $ 210.0 $ 210.0 $ $ 790.0 $ 210.0 Fiscal 2014 Senior Notes September 2020 400.0 397.9 397.2 419.1 Fiscal 2016 Senior Notes June 2026 500.0 494.1 493.5 494.6 $ 1,110.0 $ 1,102.1 $ 890.7 $ 790.0 $ 1,123.7 Total debt $ 1,110.0 $ 1,102.1 $ 1,015.5 $ 790.0 $ 1,123.7 (a) On July 1, 2016, the Company adopted ASU 2015-03 on a retrospective basis and accordingly, the Consolidated Balance Sheet as of June 30, 2016 has been updated to reflect this new classification, which resulted in a decrease in Other non-current assets of $7.1 million, a decrease in Long-term debt, excluding current portion of $7.0 million and a decrease of $0.1 million in Current portion of long-term debt at June 30, 2016 .

Borrowings under the Fiscal 2017 Revolving Credit Facility bear interest at LIBOR plus 100 basis points . In addition, the Fiscal 2017 Revolving Credit Facility has an annual facility fee equal to 12.5 basis points on the entire facility, similar to the previous Fiscal 2015 Revolving Credit Facility. The annual facility fees for the Revolving Credit Facilities totaled $1.1 million for the fiscal year ended June 30, 2017 . As of June 30, 2017 , the Company had $210.0 million in outstanding borrowings and had unused available capacity of $790.0 million under the Fiscal 2017 Revolving Credit Facility. The facility is scheduled to expire in February 2022. On June 1, 2017 the Company repaid in full the $125.0 million in Fiscal 2007 Senior Notes that were outstanding at their maturity date, using available cash. At June 30, 2017 , the carrying value of the Company outstanding Long-term debt was $1,102.1 million , consisting of: (i) borrowings on the Fiscal 2017 Revolving Credit Facility of $210.0 million , (ii) senior notes of $397.9 million ( $400.0 million principal amount less $0.3 million of unamortized bond discount and $1.9 million of unamortized debt issuance costs) due September 2020 and (iii) senior notes of $494.1 million ( $500.0 million principal amount less $1.9 million of unamortized 40 bond discount and $4.0 million of unamortized debt issuance costs) due June 2026. The Fiscal 2017 Revolving Credit Facility and senior notes are senior unsecured obligations of the Company and are ranked equally in right of payment. Interest on the senior notes due September 2020 is payable semiannually on March 1 st and September 1 st each year based on a fixed per annum rate equal to 3.95%. Interest on the senior notes due June 2026 is payable semiannually on June 27 th and December 27 th each year based on a fixed per annum rate equal to 3.40%. Our liquidity position may be negatively affected by changes in general economic conditions, regulatory requirements and access to the capital markets, which may be limited if we were to fail to renew any of the credit facilities on their renewal dates or if we were to fail to meet certain covenants.

Income Taxes The Company, headquartered in the U.S., is routinely examined by the IRS and is also routinely examined by the tax authorities in the U.S. states and foreign countries in which it conducts business. The tax years under audit examination vary by tax jurisdiction. The Company regularly considers the likelihood of assessments in each of the jurisdictions resulting from examinations. To the extent the Company determines it has potential tax assessments in particular tax jurisdictions, the Company has established tax reserves which it believes are adequate in relation to the potential assessments. Once established, reserves are adjusted when there is more information available, when an event occurs necessitating a change to the reserves or the statute of limitations for the relevant taxing authority to examine the tax position has expired. The resolution of tax matters should not have a material effect on the financial condition of the Company or on the Company Consolidated Statements of Earnings for a particular future period.
