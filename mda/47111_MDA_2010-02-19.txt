Item 7. MANAGEMENT S DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS OF FINANCIAL CONDITION AND RESULTS OF OPERATIONS EXECUTIVE OVERVIEW Our results for the year ended December 31, 2009 demonstrated excellent progress in a difficult economic environment. We exceeded net sales targets, while implementing price increases and operational efficiency improvements necessary to offset significant increases in input and employee benefits costs. We have essentially completed the global supply chain transformation program and have achieved our objectives. We increased advertising investment in our core brands in North America and in certain of our key international markets, while also achieving strong growth in adjusted earnings per share-diluted. We generated strong cash flow from operations and our financial position remains solid. Net sales increased 3.2%, which was within our long-term growth target. The increase was driven by price realization, as sales volumes declined at less than expected rates due to pricing elasticity. Earnings per share growth exceeded our long-term objective and our North American market share increased during the year. Our financial results and marketplace performance for the year indicate that our consumer-driven approach to core brand investment along with necessary pricing actions enable us to continue to meet our long-term financial goals. Our efforts will remain focused toward implementing our major strategic initiatives to deliver sustainable long-term growth in the evolving marketplace. Adjusted Non-GAAP Financial Measures Our Management Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations section includes certain measures of financial performance that are not defined by U.S. generally accepted accounting principles ( GAAP ). For each of these non-GAAP financial measures, we are providing below (1) the most directly comparable GAAP measure; (2) a reconciliation of the differences between the non-GAAP measure and the most directly comparable GAAP measure; (3) an explanation of why our management believes these non-GAAP measures provide useful information to investors; and (4) additional purposes for which we use these non-GAAP measures. We believe that the disclosure of these non-GAAP measures provides investors with a better comparison of our year-to-year operating results. We exclude the effects of certain items from Income before Interest and Income Taxes ( EBIT ), Net Income and Income per Share-Diluted-Common Stock ( EPS ) when we evaluate key measures of our performance internally, and in assessing the impact of known trends and uncertainties on our business. We also believe that excluding the effects of these items provides a more balanced view of the underlying dynamics of our business. Adjusted non-GAAP financial measures exclude the impacts of charges or credits in 2009, 2008, 2007, 2006 and 2005 associated with our business realignment initiatives and a reduction of the income tax provision in 2004 resulting from adjustments to income tax contingency reserves. 19 For the years ended December 31, 2009 2008 EBIT Net Income EPS EBIT Net Income EPS In millions of dollars except per share amounts Results in accordance with GAAP $ 761.6 $ 436.0 $ 1.90 $ 589.9 $ 311.4 $ 1.36 Adjustments: Business realignment charges included in cost of sales 10.1 6.3 .03 77.8 53.4 .23 Business realignment charges included in selling, marketing and administrative ( SM&A ) 6.1 3.8 .02 8.1 4.9 .02 Business realignment and impairment charges, net 82.9 50.7 .22 94.8 60.8 .27 Adjusted non-GAAP results $ 860.7 $ 496.8 $ 2.17 $ 770.6 $ 430.5 $ 1.88 For the years ended December 31, 2007 2006 EBIT Net Income EPS EBIT Net Income EPS In millions of dollars except per share amounts Results in accordance with GAAP $ 458.8 $ 214.2 $ .93 $ 992.6 $ 559.1 $ 2.34 Adjustments: Business realignment charges (credits) included in cost of sales 123.1 80.9 .35 (3.2 ) (2.0 ) (.01 ) Business realignment charges included in SM&A 12.6 7.8 .03 .3 .2 Business realignment and impairment charges, net 276.9 178.9 .77 14.5 9.3 .04 Adjusted non-GAAP results $ 871.4 $ 481.8 $ 2.08 $ 1,004.2 $ 566.6 $ 2.37 For the years ended December 31, 2005 2004 EBIT Net Income EPS EBIT Net Income EPS In millions of dollars except per share amounts Results in accordance with GAAP $ 853.6 $ 488.5 $ 1.97 $ 876.6 $ 574.6 $ 2.24 Adjustments: Business realignment charges included in cost of sales 22.5 13.4 .05 Business realignment and impairment charges, net 96.5 60.7 .25 Tax provision adjustment (61.1 ) (.24 ) Adjusted non-GAAP results $ 972.6 $ 562.6 $ 2.27 $ 876.6 $ 513.5 $ 2.00 Adjusted Non-GAAP Results Key Annual Performance Measures 2009 2008 2007 Increase in Net Sales 3.2% 3.8% 0.1% Increase (decrease) in adjusted EBIT 11.7% (11.6)% (13.2)% Improvement (decline) in adjusted EBIT Margin in basis points ( bps ) 120bps (260)bps (270)bps Increase (decrease) in adjusted EPS 15.4% (9.6)% (12.2)% 20 SUMMARY OF OPERATING RESULTS Analysis of Selected Items from Our Income Statement 2009 2008 2007 Percent Change Increase (Decrease) For the years ended December 31, 2009-2008 2008-2007 In millions of dollars except per share amounts Net Sales $ 5,298.7 $ 5,132.8 $ 4,946.7 3.2 % 3.8 % Cost of Sales 3,245.5 3,375.1 3,315.1 (3.8 ) 1.8 Gross Profit 2,053.2 1,757.7 1,631.6 16.8 7.7 Gross Margin 38.7 % 34.2 % 33.0 % SM&A Expense 1,208.7 1,073.0 895.9 12.6 19.8 SM&A Expense as a percent of sales 22.8 % 20.9 % 18.1 % Business Realignment and Impairment Charges, Net 82.9 94.8 276.9 (12.6 ) (65.8 ) EBIT 761.6 589.9 458.8 29.1 28.6 EBIT Margin 14.4 % 11.5 % 9.3 % Interest Expense, Net 90.5 97.9 118.6 (7.6 ) (17.5 ) Provision for Income Taxes 235.1 180.6 126.0 30.2 43.2 Effective Income Tax Rate 35.0 % 36.7 % 37.1 % Net Income $ 436.0 $ 311.4 $ 214.2 40.0 45.4 Net Income Per Share Diluted $ 1.90 $ 1.36 $ .93 39.7 46.2 Net Sales 2009 compared with 2008 The increase in net sales was primarily attributable to favorable price realization from list price increases and a reduction in promotional allowances, offset by sales volume decreases, primarily in the United States. Sales volume decreases were associated with pricing elasticity and the rationalization of certain products and businesses. Sales growth was primarily contributed by core brands, particularly Hershey , Reese , Twizzlers and Kit Kat , which benefited from our consumer-driven strategy, including advertising and in-store selling, merchandising and programming. Sales increases in local currency for our international businesses, particularly in Mexico, Canada, and Brazil, were more than offset by the unfavorable impact of foreign currency exchange rates which reduced total net sales by approximately 1.0%. The acquisition of Van Houten Singapore increased 2009 net sales by $12.0 million, or 0.2%. 2008 compared with 2007 The increase in net sales was attributable to favorable price realization from list price increases, substantially offset by sales volume decreases primarily in the United States. Increased sales in the United States were primarily attributable to our core brands, particularly Hershey and Reese s, and incremental sales of new products, primarily Hershey Bliss . Sales volume increases from our international businesses, particularly in India, China and the Philippines, also contributed to the sales increase, although were offset somewhat by the impact of unfavorable foreign currency exchange rates. Net sales for our Godrej Hershey Ltd. business increased $37.2 million, or 0.8%, in 2008 reflecting incremental sales for the full-year compared with results for 2007 which included only the seven months subsequent to the acquisition of the business. 21 Key U.S. Marketplace Metrics For the 52 weeks ended December 31, 2009 2008 2007 Consumer Takeaway Increase 7.2 % 3.3 % 1.3 % Market Share Increase (Decrease) 0.1 (0.2 ) (1.3 ) Consumer takeaway is provided for channels of distribution accounting for approximately 80% of our U.S. confectionery retail business. These channels of distribution include food, drug, mass merchandisers, including Wal-Mart Stores, Inc., and convenience stores. The change in market share is provided for channels measured by syndicated data which include sales in the food, drug, convenience store and mass merchandiser classes of trade, excluding sales of Wal-Mart Stores, Inc. Cost of Sales and Gross Margin 2009 compared with 2008 The cost of sales decrease in 2009 compared with 2008 was primarily due to sales volume decreases, favorable supply chain productivity and lower product obsolescence costs, offset substantially by higher input costs, particularly for raw materials and pension expense. During 2009, a reduction in inventories related to working capital initiatives resulted in a liquidation of applicable last-in, first-out ( LIFO ) inventory quantities carried at lower costs in prior years. This LIFO liquidation resulted in a $12.7 million cost of sales decrease. Lower business realignment charges included in cost of sales in 2009 compared with 2008 also contributed to the cost of sales decrease. Business realignment charges of $10.1 million were included in cost of sales in 2009 compared with $77.8 million in the prior year. The gross margin improvement resulted primarily from favorable price realization and supply chain productivity improvements, offset partially by increased input costs and pension expense. Approximately 1.4 percentage points of the gross margin increase was attributable to the impact of lower business realignment charges recorded in 2009 compared with 2008. 2008 compared with 2007 The cost of sales increase compared with 2007 was primarily associated with higher input and energy costs, and the full-year cost of sales for Godrej Hershey Ltd. which in 2007 included cost of sales for only the seven months subsequent to the acquisition of the business. These cost increases were offset partially by favorable supply chain productivity. Lower business realignment charges included in cost of sales in 2008 compared with 2007 also partially offset the cost of sales increases. Business realignment charges of $77.8 million were included in cost of sales in 2008, compared with $123.1 million in the prior year. Gross margin increased primarily as a result of lower business realignment charges recorded in 2008 compared with 2007, with approximately three-quarters of the increase attributable to lower business realignment charges in 2008. Favorable price realization and improved supply chain productivity also contributed to the increase, but were offset substantially by higher input and energy costs. Selling, Marketing and Administrative 2009 compared with 2008 Selling, marketing and administrative expenses increased primarily due to higher advertising expense, and increases in administrative and selling costs, principally associated with higher pension and incentive compensation expenses. An increase in advertising expense of approximately 50% was slightly offset by lower consumer promotions. Costs associated with the evaluation of potential acquisitions and divestitures increased selling, marketing and administrative expenses by approximately $11.0 million in 2009 compared with 2008. Expenses of $6.1 million related to our 2007 business realignment initiatives were included in selling, marketing and administrative expenses in 2009 compared with $8.1 million in 2008. 22 2008 compared with 2007 Selling, marketing and administrative expenses increased primarily as a result of higher costs associated with employee-related expenses, including higher incentive compensation expense, increased levels of retail coverage primarily in the United States and expansion of our international businesses. Higher advertising, marketing research and merchandising expenses also contributed to the increase. Business realignment charges of $8.1 million were included in selling, marketing and administrative expenses in 2008 compared with $12.6 million in 2007. Business Realignment Initiatives and Impairment Charges In February 2007, we announced a comprehensive, three-year supply chain transformation program (the global supply chain transformation program or GSCT ) and, in December 2007, we initiated a business realignment program associated with our business in Brazil (together, the 2007 business realignment initiatives ). In December 2008, we approved a modest expansion in the scope of the global supply chain transformation program to include the closure of two subscale manufacturing facilities of Artisan Confections Company, a wholly-owned subsidiary, and consolidation of the associated production into existing U.S. facilities, along with rationalization of other select portfolio items. The affected facilities were located in Berkeley and San Francisco, California. Additional business realignment charges related to the expansion in scope were recorded in 2009 and included severance for approximately 150 employees. The original estimated pre-tax cost of the program announced in February 2007 was from $525 million to $575 million over three years. The total included from $475 million to $525 million in business realignment costs and approximately $50 million in project implementation costs. The increase in scope approved in December 2008 increased the total expected cost by about $25 million. In addition, employee lump sum withdrawals from our defined benefit pension plans resulted in total non-cash pension settlement losses of $85.0 million which consisted of $60.4 million in 2009, $12.5 million in 2008 and $12.1 million in 2007. Total pre-tax charges and non-recurring project implementation costs were $629.1 million for the GSCT. Excluding the higher than planned non-cash pension settlement losses, the GSCT total project costs were within the projected ranges. The GSCT was essentially complete as of December 31, 2009. Total costs of $99.1 million were recorded during 2009, costs of $130.0 million were recorded in 2008 and costs of $400.0 million were recorded in 2007 for this program. The current trends of employee lump sum withdrawals from the defined benefit pension plans could result in additional non-cash pension settlement losses of $12 million to $18 million in 2010. In addition, the manufacturing facilities in Naugatuck, Connecticut; Reading, Pennsylvania and Smiths Falls, Ontario have been closed and are being held for sale. Actual proceeds from the sale of these facilities could differ from expected proceeds which could cause additional charges or credits in 2010. In an effort to improve the performance of our business in Brazil, in January 2008 Hershey do Brasil entered into a cooperative agreement with Pandurata Alimentos LTDA ( Bauducco ), a leading manufacturer of baked goods in Brazil whose primary brand is Bauducco. Business realignment and impairment charges of $4.9 million were recorded in 2008 and $12.6 million were recorded in 2007. 23 Charges (credits) associated with business realignment initiatives and impairment recorded during 2009, 2008 and 2007 were as follows: For the years ended December 31, 2009 2008 2007 In thousands of dollars Cost of sales 2007 business realignment initiatives: Global supply chain transformation program $ 10,136 $ 77,767 $ 123,090 Selling, marketing and administrative 2007 business realignment initiatives: Global supply chain transformation program 6,120 8,102 12,623 Business realignment and impairment charges, net 2007 business realignment initiatives: Global supply chain transformation program: Net (gain on sale)/impairment of fixed assets (3,418 ) (4,882 ) 47,938 Plant closure expense 22,157 23,415 13,506 Employee separation costs 2,474 11,469 176,463 Pension settlement loss 60,431 12,501 12,075 Contract termination costs 1,231 1,637 14,316 Brazilian business realignment: Goodwill impairment 12,260 Employee separation costs 1,581 310 Fixed asset impairment charges 754 Contract termination and other exit costs 2,587 2008 impairment of trademarks 45,739 Total business realignment and impairment charges, net 82,875 94,801 276,868 Total net charges associated with business realignment initiatives and impairment $ 99,131 $ 180,670 $ 412,581 Global Supply Chain Transformation Program The charge of $10.1 million recorded in cost of sales during 2009 related primarily to the start-up costs associated with the global supply chain transformation program and the accelerated depreciation of fixed assets over the estimated remaining useful life. The $6.1 million recorded in selling, marketing and administrative expenses related primarily to project administration for the global supply chain transformation program. The $3.4 million net gain on sale of fixed assets related primarily to higher proceeds from the sale of equipment. The $22.2 million of plant closure expenses for 2009 related primarily to the preparation of plants for sale and equipment removal costs. In determining the costs related to fixed asset impairments, fair value was estimated based on the expected sales proceeds. Certain real estate with a carrying value of $11.7 million was being held for sale as of December 31, 2009. The global supply chain transformation program had identified six manufacturing facilities which would be closed. As of December 31, 2009, manufacturing facilities located in Dartmouth, Nova Scotia; Oakdale, California; and Montreal, Quebec have been closed and sold. The facilities located in Naugatuck, Connecticut; Reading, Pennsylvania; and Smiths Falls, Ontario have been closed and are being held for sale. The global supply chain transformation program employee separation costs were primarily related to involuntary terminations at the manufacturing facilities of Artisan Confections Company which have been closed. The higher pension settlement loss in 2009 compared to 2008 resulted from an increase in actuarial losses associated with the significant decline in the fair value of pension assets in 2008, along with the increased level of lump sum withdrawals from a defined benefit pension plan related to employee departures associated with the global supply chain transformation program. 24 The 2008 charge of $77.8 million recorded in cost of sales for the global supply chain transformation program related primarily to the accelerated depreciation of fixed assets over a reduced estimated remaining useful life and start-up costs associated with the global supply chain transformation program. The $8.1 million recorded in selling, marketing and administrative expenses related primarily to project administration for the global supply chain transformation program. In determining the costs related to fixed asset impairments, fair value was estimated based on the expected sales proceeds. The $4.9 million of gains on sale of fixed assets resulted from the receipt of proceeds in excess of the carrying value primarily from the sale of a warehousing and distribution facility. The $23.4 million of plant closure expenses for 2008 related primarily to the preparation of plants for sale and production line removal costs. Certain real estate with a carrying value of $15.8 million was being held for sale as of December 31, 2008. The global supply chain transformation program employee separation costs were related to involuntary terminations at the North American manufacturing facilities which were being closed. The 2007 charge of $123.1 million recorded in cost of sales for the global supply chain transformation program related primarily to the accelerated depreciation of fixed assets over a reduced estimated remaining useful life and costs related to inventory reductions. The $12.6 million recorded in selling, marketing and administrative expenses related primarily to project management and administration. In determining the costs related to fixed asset impairments, fair value was estimated based on the expected sales proceeds. Certain real estate with a carrying value of $40.2 million was being held for sale as of December 31, 2007. Employee separation costs included $79.0 million primarily for involuntary terminations at the 6 North American manufacturing facilities which were being closed. The employee separation costs also included $97.5 million for charges relating to pension and other post-retirement benefits curtailments and special termination benefits. Brazilian Business Realignment The 2008 Brazilian business realignment charges and the 2007 employee separation costs were related to involuntary terminations and costs associated with office consolidation related to the cooperative agreement with Bauducco. During the fourth quarter of 2007, we completed our annual impairment evaluation of goodwill and other intangible assets. As a result of reduced expectations for future cash flows resulting primarily from lower expected profitability, we determined that the carrying amount of our wholly-owned subsidiary, Hershey do Brasil, exceeded its fair value and recorded a non-cash impairment charge of $12.3 million in December 2007. There was no tax benefit associated with this charge. 2008 Impairment of Trademarks As a result of our annual impairment tests of intangible assets with useful lives determined to be indefinite, we recorded total impairment charges of $45.7 million in December 2008. We determined that the carrying amounts of certain trademarks, primarily the Mauna Loa brand, exceeded their estimated fair value due to reduced expectations for future sales and cash flows compared with the valuations at the acquisition dates. For more information, refer to pages 46 and 47. Liabilities Associated with Business Realignment Initiatives The liability balance as of December 31, 2009 relating to the 2007 business realignment initiatives was $9.2 million, primarily for employee separation and plant closure costs to be paid in 2010. The liability balance as of December 31, 2009 was increased by $0.1 million as a result of foreign currency translation adjustments. The liability balance as of December 31, 2008 was $31.0 million, primarily related to employee separation costs. Charges for plant closure and employee separation costs of $6.6 million were recorded in 2009. We made payments of $28.5 million in 2009 and $46.9 million in 2008 against the liabilities recorded for the 2007 business realignment initiatives, principally related to employee separation and project administration. 25 Income Before Interest and Income Taxes and EBIT Margin 2009 compared with 2008 EBIT increased in 2009 compared with 2008 principally as a result of higher gross profit and reduced business realignment charges, partially offset by increased selling, marketing and administrative expenses. Net pre-tax business realignment charges of $99.1 million were recorded in 2009 compared with $180.7 million recorded in 2008, a decrease of $81.6 million. EBIT margin increased from 11.5% for 2008 to 14.4% for 2009. The increase in EBIT margin was the result of the higher gross margin, partially offset by higher selling, marketing and administrative expense as a percentage of sales. Net business realignment and impairment charges reduced EBIT margin by 1.8 percentage points in 2009 and by 3.5 percentage points in 2008, resulting in an improvement in EBIT margin of 1.7 percentage points from 2008 to 2009. 2008 compared with 2007 EBIT increased in 2008 compared with 2007 as a result of lower net business realignment charges. Net pre-tax business realignment charges of $180.7 million were recorded in 2008 compared with $412.6 million in 2007. The increase in EBIT resulting from lower business realignment charges and an increase in gross profit was substantially offset by higher selling, marketing and administrative expenses. EBIT margin increased from 9.3% in 2007 to 11.5% in 2008. Net business realignment and impairment charges reduced EBIT margin by 3.5 percentage points in 2008 and 8.3 percentage points in 2007, resulting in an improvement in EBIT margin of 4.8 percentage points from 2007 to 2008. This impact was substantially offset by higher selling, marketing and administrative expense as a percentage of sales. Interest Expense, Net 2009 compared with 2008 Net interest expense was lower in 2009 than the comparable period of 2008 primarily due to lower interest rates and lower average debt balances. 2008 compared with 2007 Net interest expense was lower in 2008 than in 2007 primarily due to lower interest rates and reduced borrowings as compared with the prior year. Income Taxes and Effective Tax Rate 2009 compared with 2008 Our effective income tax rate was 35.0% for 2009 and was decreased by 0.5 percentage points as a result of the effective tax rate associated with business realignment charges recorded during the year. Our effective income tax rate was also lower in 2009 due to changes in the mix of income among various tax jurisdictions as compared with 2008. 2008 compared with 2007 Our effective income tax rate was 36.7% in 2008, and was increased by 0.7 percentage points as a result of the effective tax rate associated with business realignment charges recorded during the year. 26 Net Income and Net Income Per Share 2009 compared with 2008 Net income in 2009 was reduced by $60.8 million, or $0.27 per share-diluted, and was reduced by $119.1 million, or $0.52 per share-diluted, in 2008 as a result of net charges associated with our business realignment initiatives. After considering the impact of business realignment and impairment charges in each period, earnings per share-diluted in 2009 increased $0.29, or 15.4%, as compared with 2008. 2008 compared with 2007 As a result of net charges associated with our business realignment initiatives, net income in 2008 was reduced by $119.1 million or $0.52 per share-diluted. After considering the impact of business realignment and impairment charges in each period, earnings per share-diluted in 2008 decreased $0.20 as compared with 2007. 27 FINANCIAL CONDITION Our financial condition remained strong during 2009. Solid cash flow from operations and our liquidity, leverage and capital structure contributed to our continued investment grade credit rating by recognized rating agencies. Acquisitions and Divestitures In March 2009, we completed the acquisition of the Van Houten Singapore consumer business. The acquisition from Barry Callebaut, AG provides us with an exclusive license of the Van Houten brand name and related trademarks in Asia and the Middle East for the retail and duty free distribution channels. The purchase price for the acquisition of Van Houten Singapore and the licensing agreement was approximately $15.2 million. Total liabilities assumed were $3.6 million. In January 2008, our Brazilian subsidiary, Hershey do Brasil, entered into a cooperative agreement with Bauducco. In the fourth quarter of 2007, we recorded a goodwill impairment charge and approved a business realignment program associated with initiatives to improve distribution and enhance performance of our business in Brazil. In the first quarter of 2008, we received approximately $2.0 million in cash and recorded an other intangible asset of $13.7 million associated with the cooperative agreement with Bauducco in exchange for our conveying to Bauducco a 49% interest in Hershey do Brasil. We maintain a 51% controlling interest in Hershey do Brasil. In May 2007, we entered into an agreement with Godrej Beverages and Foods, Ltd., one of India largest consumer goods, confectionery and food companies, to manufacture and distribute confectionery products, snacks and beverages across India. Under the agreement, we invested $61.5 million during 2007 and own a 51% controlling interest in Godrej Hershey Ltd. Total liabilities assumed were $51.6 million. Effective in May 2007, this business acquisition was included in our consolidated results, including the related noncontrolling interest. Also in May 2007, we entered into a manufacturing agreement in China with Lotte Confectionery Co., LTD. to produce Hershey products and certain Lotte products for the markets in Asia, particularly in China. We invested $39.0 million in 2007 and own a 44% interest. We are accounting for this investment using the equity method. We included results subsequent to the dates of acquisition in the consolidated financial statements. Had the results of the acquisitions been included in the consolidated financial statements for each of the periods presented, the effect would not have been material. Assets A summary of our assets is as follows: December 31, 2009 2008 In thousands of dollars Current assets $ 1,385,434 $ 1,344,945 Property, plant and equipment, net 1,404,767 1,458,949 Goodwill and other intangibles 697,100 665,449 Deferred income taxes 4,353 13,815 Other assets 183,377 151,561 Total assets $ 3,675,031 $ 3,634,719 The change in current assets from 2008 to 2009 was primarily due to the following: Higher cash and cash equivalents in 2009 due to improved cash flows from operations, which significantly reduced the need for short-term borrowings; 28 A decrease in accounts receivable primarily resulting from the timing of sales and cash collections in December 2009 as compared with December 2008, along with a decrease in extended dated receivables associated with sales of seasonal items and new products; A decrease in inventories primarily related to initiatives to improve sales forecasting and inventory planning; A decrease in deferred income taxes primarily related to the effect of hedging transactions; and A decrease in prepaid expenses and other current assets primarily reflecting the timing of income tax payments for various tax jurisdictions and the effect of certain hedging transactions. Property, plant and equipment was lower in 2009 as depreciation expense of $158.0 million and asset retirements more than offset capital additions of $126.3 million. Accelerated depreciation of fixed assets at facilities which were being closed as well as certain asset retirements resulted primarily from the global supply chain transformation program. Goodwill and other intangibles increased primarily as a result of the Van Houten Singapore acquisition and the effect of currency translation adjustments. Other assets increased primarily due to the change in the funded status of our pension plans as well as the effect of certain hedging transactions. Liabilities A summary of our liabilities is as follows: December 31, 2009 2008 In thousands of dollars Current liabilities $ 910,628 $ 1,270,212 Long-term debt 1,502,730 1,505,954 Other long-term liabilities 501,334 504,963 Deferred income taxes 3,646 Total liabilities $ 2,914,692 $ 3,284,775 Changes in current liabilities from 2008 to 2009 were primarily the result of the following: Higher accounts payable reflecting the timing of inventory deliveries to support manufacturing requirements and higher costs of goods and services; Higher accrued liabilities primarily associated with advertising and promotions, certain hedging transactions, as well as higher expected incentive compensation payments in 2010, partially offset by payments of liabilities associated with the 2007 business realignment initiatives; and A decrease in short-term debt of $459.1 million reflecting repayments of commercial paper borrowings facilitated by strong cash flow during 2009. Capital Structure We have two classes of stock outstanding, Common Stock and Class B Stock. Holders of the Common Stock and the Class B Stock generally vote together without regard to class on matters submitted to stockholders, including the election of directors. Holders of the Common Stock have one vote per share. Holders of the Class B Stock have 10 votes per share. Holders of the Common Stock, voting separately as a class, are entitled to elect one-sixth of our Board of Directors. With respect to dividend rights, holders of the Common Stock are entitled to cash dividends 10% higher than those declared and paid on the Class B Stock. 29 Hershey Trust Company, as trustee for the benefit of Milton Hershey School (the Milton Hershey School Trust or the Trust ) maintains voting control over The Hershey Company. Historically, the Milton Hershey School Trust had not taken an active role in setting our policy, nor had it exercised influence with regard to the ongoing business decisions of our Board of Directors or management. However, in October 2007, the Chairman of the Board of the Milton Hershey School Trust issued a statement indicating that the Trust continues to be guided by two key principles: first, that, in its role as controlling stockholder of the Company, it intends to retain its controlling interest in The Hershey Company and, second, that the long-term prosperity of the Company requires the Board of Directors of the Company and its management to build on its strong U.S. position by aggressively pursuing strategies for domestic and international growth. He further stated that the Milton Hershey School Trust had communicated to the Company Board that the Trust was not satisfied with the Company results and that, as a result, the Trust was actively engaged in an ongoing process, the goal of which has been to ensure vigorous Company Board focus on resolving the Company current business challenges and on implementing new growth strategies. In that release, the Trust board chairman reiterated the Trust longstanding position that the Company Board, and not the Trust board, is solely responsible and accountable for the Company management and performance. Arnold G. Langbo and Charles B. Strauss resigned from the Board of Directors of the Company effective August 10, 2009, following a decision by the Board of Directors to establish a Finance and Risk Management Committee that also delegated to such committee responsibilities with respect to reviewing and monitoring the Company annual plan and certain strategic matters including but not limited to acquisitions and dispositions. Messrs. Langbo and Strauss decided to resign from the Board of Directors based on their views, expressed before the committee was established, that retaining responsibility for these matters with the Board of Directors as a whole was a better corporate governance structure for the Company. On November 11, 2007 we announced that all of the members of our Board of Directors had resigned except for Richard H. Lenny, who was at that time our Chairman of the Board and Chief Executive Officer, David J. West, who was at that time President of the Company and currently serves as our President and Chief Executive Officer, and Robert F. Cavanaugh, who is also a member of the board of directors of Hershey Trust Company and board of managers (governing body) of Milton Hershey School. In addition, we announced that the Milton Hershey School Trust through stockholder action effected by written consent had amended the By-laws of the Company to allow the Company stockholders to fix the number of directors to serve on our Board of Directors and from time to time to increase or decrease such number of directors, expanded the size of our Board of Directors from 11 directors to 13 directors, and appointed 8 new directors, including two who are also members of the board of directors of Hershey Trust Company and board of managers of Milton Hershey School. The Milton Hershey School Trust decided to explore a sale of The Hershey Company in June 2002, but subsequently decided to terminate the sale process in September 2002. After terminating the sale process, the Trustee of the Milton Hershey School Trust advised the Pennsylvania Office of Attorney General in September 2002 that it would not agree to any sale of its controlling interest in The Hershey Company without approval of the court having jurisdiction over the Milton Hershey School Trust following advance notice to the Office of Attorney General. Subsequently, Pennsylvania enacted legislation that requires that the Office of Attorney General be provided advance notice of any transaction that would result in the Milton Hershey School Trust no longer having voting control of the Company. The law provides specific statutory authority for the Attorney General to intercede and petition the Court having jurisdiction over the Milton Hershey School Trust to stop such a transaction if the Attorney General can prove that the transaction is unnecessary for the future economic viability of the Company and is inconsistent with investment and management considerations under fiduciary obligations. This legislation could have the effect of making it more difficult for a third party to acquire a majority of our outstanding voting stock and thereby delay or prevent a change in control of the Company. In December 2000, our Board of Directors unanimously adopted a Stockholder Protection Rights Agreement ( Rights Agreement ). The Milton Hershey School Trust supported the Rights Agreement. This action was not in response to any specific effort to acquire control of The Hershey Company. Under the Rights 30 Agreement, our Board of Directors declared a dividend of one right ( Right ) for each outstanding share of Common Stock and Class B Stock payable to stockholders of record at the close of business on December 26, 2000. The Rights will at no time have voting power or receive dividends. The issuance of the Rights has no dilutive effect, will not affect reported earnings per share, is not taxable and will not change the manner in which our Common Stock is traded. We discuss the Rights Agreement in more detail in Note 16, Capital Stock and Net Income Per Share . Noncontrolling Interests in Subsidiaries As of January 1, 2009, the Company adopted a Financial Accounting Standards Board ( FASB ) accounting standard that establishes new accounting and reporting requirements for the noncontrolling interest in a subsidiary (formerly known as minority interest) and for the deconsolidation of a subsidiary and requires the noncontrolling interest to be reported as a component of equity. In addition, changes in a parent ownership interest while the parent retains its controlling interest will be accounted for as equity transactions, and any retained noncontrolling equity investment upon the deconsolidation of a subsidiary will be measured initially at fair value. In May 2007, we entered into an agreement with Godrej Beverages and Foods, Ltd. to manufacture and distribute confectionery products, snacks and beverages across India. Under the agreement, we own a 51% controlling interest in Godrej Hershey Ltd. In January 2009, the Company contributed cash of approximately $8.7 million to Godrej Hershey Ltd. and owners of the noncontrolling interests in Godrej Hershey Ltd. contributed approximately $7.3 million. The ownership interest percentages in Godrej Hershey Ltd. did not change significantly as a result of these contributions. The noncontrolling interests in Godrej Hershey Ltd. are included in the equity section of the Consolidated Balance Sheets. We also own a 51% controlling interest in Hershey do Brasil under the cooperative agreement with Bauducco. The noncontrolling interest in Hershey do Brasil is included in the equity section of the Consolidated Balance Sheets. The increase in noncontrolling interests in subsidiaries from $31.7 million as of December 31, 2008 to $39.9 million as of December 31, 2009 reflected the $7.3 million contribution from the noncontrolling interests in Godrej Hershey Ltd. and the impact of currency translation adjustments, partially offset by a reduction resulting from the recording of the share of losses pertaining to the noncontrolling interests. The share of losses pertaining to the noncontrolling interests in subsidiaries was $4.1 million for the year ended December 31, 2009, $6.1 million for the year ended December 31, 2008 and $1.3 million for the year ended December 31, 2007. This was reflected in selling, marketing and administrative expenses. 31 LIQUIDITY AND CAPITAL RESOURCES Our principal source of liquidity is operating cash flows. Our net income and, consequently, our cash provided from operations are impacted by: sales volume, seasonal sales patterns, timing of new product introductions, profit margins and price changes. Sales are typically higher during the third and fourth quarters of the year due to seasonal and holiday-related sales patterns. Generally, working capital needs peak during the summer months. We meet these needs primarily by issuing commercial paper. Cash Flows from Operating Activities Our cash flows provided from (used by) operating activities were as follows: For the years ended December 31, 2009 2008 2007 In thousands of dollars Net income $ 435,994 $ 311,405 $ 214,154 Depreciation and amortization 182,411 249,491 310,925 Stock-based compensation and excess tax benefits 30,472 22,196 9,526 Deferred income taxes (40,578 ) (17,125 ) (124,276 ) Business realignment and impairment charges, net of tax 60,823 119,117 267,653 Contributions to pension plans (54,457 ) (32,759 ) (15,836 ) Working capital 157,812 65,791 148,019 Changes in other assets and liabilities 293,272 (198,555 ) (31,329 ) Net cash provided from operating activities $ 1,065,749 $ 519,561 $ 778,836 Over the past three years, total cash provided from operating activities was approximately $2.4 billion. Depreciation and amortization expenses decreased in 2009 principally as the result of lower accelerated depreciation charges related to the 2007 business realignment initiatives compared with accelerated depreciation charges recorded in 2007 and 2008. Accelerated depreciation recorded in 2009 was approximately $4.2 million compared with approximately $60.6 million recorded in 2008 and $108.6 million recorded in 2007. Depreciation and amortization expenses represent non-cash items that impacted net income and are reflected in the consolidated statements of cash flows to reconcile cash flows from operating activities. Cash used by deferred income taxes increased in 2009 compared with 2008 primarily as a result of the tax impact associated with hedging transactions. Cash used by deferred income taxes in 2008 and 2007, primarily reflected the impact of deferred taxes associated with the 2007 business realignment and impairment charges recorded during 2008 and 2007. We contributed $103.1 million to our pension plans over the past three years to improve the plans funded status and to pay benefits under the non-funded plans. As of December 31, 2009, our pension benefit obligations exceeded the fair value of our pension plan assets by $15.1 million. Over the three year period, cash provided from working capital tended to fluctuate due to the timing of sales and cash collections during December of each year and working capital management practices, including initiatives implemented to reduce working capital. During the three year period, cash provided from or used by changes in other assets and liabilities primarily reflected the effect of hedging transactions and the impact of business realignment initiatives, along with the related tax effects. The increase in income taxes paid in 2009 compared with 2008 primarily reflected the impact of higher taxable income for 2009. 32 Cash Flows from Investing Activities Our cash flows provided from (used by) investing activities were as follows: For the years ended December 31, 2009 2008 2007 In thousands of dollars Capital additions $ (126,324 ) $ (262,643 ) $ (189,698 ) Capitalized software additions (19,146 ) (20,336 ) (14,194 ) Proceeds from sales of property, plant and equipment 10,364 82,815 Business acquisitions (15,220 ) (100,461 ) Proceeds from divestitures 1,960 Net cash used by investing activities $ (150,326 ) $ (198,204 ) $ (304,353 ) Capital additions in 2009 associated with our global supply chain transformation program were approximately $46.3 million compared with $162.6 million in 2008. Other capital additions were primarily related to modernization of existing facilities and purchases of manufacturing equipment for new products. Capitalized software additions were primarily for ongoing enhancement of our information systems. In 2009, we received $10.4 million in proceeds from the sale of manufacturing facilities and related equipment under the global supply chain transformation program compared with $82.8 million received in 2008. We anticipate total capital expenditures, including capitalized software, of approximately $150 million to $160 million in 2010. In March 2009, our Company completed the acquisition of the Van Houten Singapore consumer business. The purchase price for the acquisition of Van Houten Singapore and a licensing agreement was approximately $15.2 million. In January 2008, our Brazilian subsidiary, Hershey do Brasil, entered into a cooperative agreement with Bauducco. We received approximately $2.0 million in cash associated with the cooperative agreement in exchange for a 49% interest in Hershey do Brasil. In May 2007, we entered into an agreement with Godrej Beverages and Foods, Ltd. to manufacture and distribute confectionery products, snacks and beverages across India. Under the agreement, we invested $61.5 million in this business during 2007. In May 2007, our Company and Lotte Confectionery Co. LTD. entered into a manufacturing agreement to produce Hershey products and certain Lotte products for markets in Asia, particularly in China. We invested $39.0 million in this business during 2007. Cash Flows from Financing Activities Our cash flows provided from (used by) financing activities were as follows: For the years ended December 31, 2009 2008 2007 In thousands of dollars Net change in short-term borrowings $ (458,047 ) $ (371,393 ) $ 195,055 Long-term borrowings 247,845 Repayment of long-term debt (8,252 ) (4,977 ) (188,891 ) Cash dividends paid (263,403 ) (262,949 ) (252,263 ) Exercise of stock options 32,773 38,383 59,958 Contributions from noncontrolling interests in subsidiaries 7,322 Repurchase of Common Stock (9,314 ) (60,361 ) (256,285 ) Net cash used by financing activities $ (698,921 ) $ (413,452 ) $ (442,426 ) 33 We use short-term borrowings (commercial paper and bank borrowings) to fund seasonal working capital requirements and ongoing business needs. Additional information on short-term borrowings is included under Borrowing Arrangements below. In March 2008, we issued $250 million of 5.0% Notes due in 2013. The Notes were issued under a shelf registration statement on Form S-3 filed in May 2006 described under Registration Statements below. In March 2007, we repaid $150.0 million of 6.95% Notes due in 2007. We paid cash dividends of $198.4 million on our Common Stock and $65.0 million on our Class B Stock in 2009. Cash received from the exercise of stock options was partially offset by cash used for the repurchase of Common Stock. Repurchases and Issuances of Common Stock For the years ended December 31, 2009 2008 2007 In thousands Shares Dollars Shares Dollars Shares Dollars Shares repurchased under pre-approved share repurchase programs: Open market repurchases $ $ 2,916 $ 149,983 Shares repurchased to replace Treasury Stock issued for stock options and employee benefits 252 9,314 1,610 60,361 2,046 106,302 Total share repurchases 252 9,314 1,610 60,361 4,962 256,285 Shares issued for stock options and employee benefits (1,215 ) (39,616 ) (1,595 ) (51,992 ) (1,748 ) (56,670 ) Net change (963 ) $ (30,302 ) 15 $ 8,369 3,214 $ 199,615 We intend to repurchase shares of Common Stock in 2010 in order to replace Treasury Stock shares issued for exercised stock options. The value of shares purchased in a given period will vary based on stock options exercised over time and market conditions. In December 2006, our Board of Directors approved a $250 million share repurchase program. As of December 31, 2009, $100.0 million remained available for repurchases of Common Stock under this program. Cumulative Share Repurchases and Issuances A summary of cumulative share repurchases and issuances is as follows: Shares Dollars In thousands Shares repurchased under authorized programs: Open market repurchases 57,436 $ 1,984,431 Repurchases from the Milton Hershey School Trust 11,918 245,550 Shares retired (1,056 ) (12,820 ) Total repurchases under authorized programs 68,298 2,217,161 Privately negotiated purchases from the Milton Hershey School Trust 67,282 1,501,373 Shares reissued for stock option obligations, supplemental retirement contributions, and employee stock ownership trust obligations (30,305 ) (802,159 ) Shares repurchased to replace reissued shares 26,629 1,063,254 Total held as Treasury Stock as of December 31, 2009 131,904 $ 3,979,629 34 Borrowing Arrangements We maintain debt levels we consider prudent based on our cash flow, interest coverage ratio and percentage of debt to capital. We use debt financing to lower our overall cost of capital which increases our return on stockholders equity. In December 2006, we entered into a five-year agreement establishing an unsecured committed revolving credit facility to borrow up to $1.1 billion, with an option to increase borrowings to $1.5 billion with the consent of the lenders. During the fourth quarter of 2007, the lenders approved an extension of this agreement by one year in accordance with our option under the agreement. The five-year agreement will now expire in December 2012. As of December 31, 2009, $1.1 billion was available to borrow under the agreement. The unsecured revolving credit agreement contains certain financial and other covenants, customary representations, warranties, and events of default. As of December 31, 2009, we complied with all of these covenants. We may use these funds for general corporate purposes, including commercial paper backstop and business acquisitions. In August 2007, we entered into an unsecured revolving short-term credit agreement to borrow up to an additional $300 million because we believed at the time that seasonal working capital needs, share repurchases and other business activities would cause our borrowings to exceed the $1.1 billion borrowing limit available under our five-year credit agreement. We used the funds borrowed under this new agreement for general corporate purposes, including commercial paper backstop. Although the new agreement was scheduled to expire in August 2008, we elected to terminate it in June 2008 because we determined that we no longer needed the additional borrowing capacity provided by the agreement. In addition to the revolving credit facility, we maintain lines of credit with domestic and international commercial banks. As of December 31, 2009, we could borrow up to approximately $68.9 million in various currencies under the lines of credit and as of December 31, 2008, we could borrow up to $67.1 million. Registration Statements In May 2009, we filed a shelf registration statement on Form S-3 that registered an indeterminate amount of debt securities. This registration statement was effective immediately upon filing under Securities and Exchange Commission regulations governing well-known seasoned issuers (the WKSI Registration Statement ). This WKSI Registration Statement was filed to replace a May 2006 WKSI Registration Statement which expired in May 2009. In March 2008, we issued $250 million of 5.0% Notes due April 1, 2013. The Notes were issued under the 2006 WKSI Registration Statement. Proceeds from the debt issuances and any other offerings under the WKSI Registration Statement may be used for general corporate requirements. These may include reducing existing borrowings, financing capital additions, funding contributions to our pension plans, future business acquisitions and working capital requirements. 35 OFF-BALANCE SHEET ARRANGEMENTS, CONTRACTUAL OBLIGATIONS AND CONTINGENT LIABILITIES AND COMMITMENTS As of December 31, 2009, our contractual cash obligations by year were as follows: Payments Due by Year In thousands of dollars Contractual Obligations 2010 2011 2012 2013 2014 Thereafter Total Unconditional Purchase Obligations $ 1,111,200 $ 589,500 $ 356,100 $ 234,900 $ $ $ 2,291,700 Non-cancelable Operating Leases 14,020 11,171 10,106 6,422 6,174 13,599 61,492 Long-term Debt 15,247 253,707 150,967 250,000 848,056 1,517,977 Total Obligations $ 1,140,467 $ 854,378 $ 517,173 $ 491,322 $ 6,174 $ 861,655 $ 3,871,169 In entering into contractual obligations, we have assumed the risk that might arise from the possible inability of counterparties to meet the terms of their contracts. We mitigate this risk by performing financial assessments prior to contract execution, conducting periodic evaluations of counterparty performance and maintaining a diverse portfolio of qualified counterparties. Our risk is limited to replacing the contracts at prevailing market rates. We do not expect any significant losses resulting from counterparty defaults. Purchase Obligations We enter into certain obligations for the purchase of raw materials. These obligations were primarily in the form of forward contracts for the purchase of raw materials from third-party brokers and dealers. These contracts minimize the effect of future price fluctuations by fixing the price of part or all of these purchase obligations. Total obligations for each year presented above, consists of fixed price contracts for the purchase of commodities and unpriced contracts that were valued using market prices as of December 31, 2009. The cost of commodities associated with the unpriced contracts is variable as market prices change over future periods. We mitigate the variability of these costs to the extent we have entered into commodities futures contracts to hedge our costs for those periods. Increases or decreases in market prices are offset by gains or losses on commodities futures contracts. This applies to the extent that we have hedged the unpriced contracts as of December 31, 2009 and in future periods by entering into commodities futures contracts. Taking delivery of and making payments for the specific commodities for use in the manufacture of finished goods satisfies our obligations under the forward purchase contracts. For each of the three years in the period ended December 31, 2009, we satisfied these obligations by taking delivery of and making payment for the specific commodities. Asset Retirement Obligations We have a number of facilities that contain varying amounts of asbestos in certain locations within the facilities. Our asbestos management program is compliant with current applicable regulations. Current regulations require that we handle or dispose of asbestos in a special manner if such facilities undergo major renovations or are demolished. We believe we do not have sufficient information to estimate the fair value of any asset retirement obligations related to these facilities. We cannot specify the settlement date or range of potential settlement dates and, therefore, sufficient information is not available to apply an expected present value technique. We expect to maintain the facilities with repairs and maintenance activities that would not involve or require the removal of asbestos. As of December 31, 2009, certain real estate associated with the closure of facilities under the global supply chain transformation program is being held for sale. We are not aware of any significant obligations related to the environmental remediation of these facilities which have not been reflected in our current estimates. 36 Income Tax Obligations We base our deferred income taxes, accrued income taxes and provision for income taxes upon income, statutory tax rates, the legal structure of our Company and interpretation of tax laws. We are regularly audited by federal, state and foreign tax authorities. From time to time, these audits result in assessments of additional tax. We maintain reserves for such assessments. We adjust the reserves based upon changing facts and circumstances, such as receiving audit assessments or clearing of an item for which a reserve has been established. Assessments of additional tax require cash payments. We are not aware of any significant income tax assessments. The amount of tax obligations is not included in the table of contractual cash obligations by year on page 36 because we are unable to reasonably predict the ultimate amount or timing of settlement of our reserves for income taxes. ACCOUNTING POLICIES AND MARKET RISKS ASSOCIATED WITH DERIVATIVE INSTRUMENTS We use certain derivative instruments, from time to time, including interest rate swaps, foreign currency forward exchange contracts and options, and commodities futures and options contracts, to manage interest rate, foreign currency exchange rate and commodity market price risk exposures, respectively. We enter into interest rate swap agreements and foreign exchange forward contracts and options for periods consistent with related underlying exposures. These derivative instruments do not constitute positions independent of those exposures. We enter into commodities futures and options contracts for varying periods. These futures and options contracts are intended to be, and are effective as hedges of market price risks associated with anticipated raw material purchases, energy requirements and transportation costs. We do not hold or issue derivative instruments for trading purposes and are not a party to any instruments with leverage or prepayment features. In entering into these contracts, we have assumed the risk that might arise from the possible inability of counterparties to meet the terms of their contracts. We mitigate this risk by performing financial assessments prior to contract execution, conducting periodic evaluations of counterparty performance and maintaining a diverse portfolio of qualified counterparties. We do not expect any significant losses from counterparty defaults. Accounting Policies Associated with Derivative Instruments We report the effective portion of the gain or loss on a derivative instrument designated and qualifying as a cash flow hedging instrument as a component of other comprehensive income. We reclassify the effective portion of the gain or loss on these derivative instruments into income in the same period or periods during which the hedged transaction affects earnings. The remaining gain or loss on the derivative instrument resulting from hedge ineffectiveness, if any, must be recognized currently in earnings. Fair value hedges pertain to derivative instruments that qualify as a hedge of exposures to changes in the fair value of a firm commitment or assets and liabilities recognized on the balance sheet. For fair value hedges, our policy is to record the gain or loss on the derivative instrument in earnings in the period of change together with the offsetting loss or gain on the hedged item. The effect of that accounting is to reflect in earnings the extent to which the hedge is not effective in achieving offsetting changes in fair value. As of December 31, 2009, we designated and accounted for all derivative instruments, including foreign exchange forward contracts and options and commodities futures and options contracts, as cash flow hedges. Additional information regarding accounting policies associated with derivative instruments is contained in Note 6, Derivative Instruments and Hedging Activities . The information below summarizes our market risks associated with long-term debt and derivative instruments outstanding as of December 31, 2009. Note 1, Note 6 and Note 7 to the Consolidated Financial Statements provide additional information. 37 Long-Term Debt The table below presents the principal cash flows and related interest rates by maturity date for long-term debt, including the current portion, as of December 31, 2009. We determined the fair value of long-term debt based upon quoted market prices for the same or similar debt issues. Maturity Date 2010 2011 2012 2013 2014 Thereafter Total Fair Value In thousands of dollars except for rates Long-term Debt $ 15,247 $ 253,707 $ 150,967 $ 250,000 $ $ 848,056 $ 1,517,977 $ 1,654,367 Interest Rate 10.2 % 5.3 % 7.0 % 5.0 % 6.2 % 6.0 % We calculated the interest rates on variable rate obligations using the rates in effect as of December 31, 2009. Interest Rate Swaps In order to minimize financing costs and to manage interest rate exposure, from time to time, we enter into interest rate swap agreements. In March 2009, we entered into forward starting interest rate swap agreements to hedge interest rate exposure related to the anticipated $250 million of term financing expected to be executed during 2011 to repay $250 million of 5.3% Notes maturing in September 2011. The weighted-average fixed rate on the forward starting swap agreements was 3.5%. The fair value of interest rate swap agreements was a net asset of $9.2 million as of December 31, 2009. Our risk related to interest rate swap agreements is limited to the cost of replacing such agreements at prevailing market rates. As of December 31, 2009, the potential net loss associated with interest rate swap agreements resulting from a hypothetical near-term adverse change in interest rates of ten percent was approximately $4.9 million. For more information see Note 6 , Derivative Instruments and Hedging Activities . As of December 31, 2008 we were not a party to any interest rate swap agreements. Foreign Exchange Forward Contracts and Options We enter into foreign exchange forward contracts and options to hedge transactions denominated in foreign currencies. These transactions are primarily purchase commitments or forecasted purchases of equipment, raw materials and finished goods. We also may hedge payment of forecasted intercompany transactions with our subsidiaries outside of the United States. These contracts reduce currency risk from exchange rate movements. We generally hedge foreign currency price risks for periods from 3 to 24 months. Foreign exchange forward contracts are effective as hedges of identifiable foreign currency commitments. We designate our foreign exchange forward contracts as cash flow hedging derivatives. The fair value of these contracts is classified as either an asset or liability on the Consolidated Balance Sheets. We record gains and losses on these contracts as a component of other comprehensive income and reclassify them into earnings in the same period during which the hedged transaction affects earnings. 38 A summary of foreign exchange forward contracts and the corresponding amounts at contracted forward rates is as follows: December 31, 2009 2008 Contract Amount Primary Currencies Contract Amount Primary Currencies In millions of dollars Foreign exchange forward contracts to purchase foreign currencies $ 2.7 Euros Swiss francs $ 0.8 Euros Swiss francs Mexican pesos Foreign exchange forward contracts to sell foreign currencies $ 106.3 Canadian dollars $ 68.1 Canadian dollars Australian dollars We define the fair value of foreign exchange forward contracts as the amount of the difference between the contracted and current market foreign currency exchange rates at the end of the period. We estimate the fair value of foreign exchange forward contracts on a quarterly basis by obtaining market quotes of spot and forward rates for contracts with similar terms, adjusted where necessary for maturity differences. A summary of the fair value and market risk associated with foreign exchange forward contracts is as follows: December 31, 2009 2008 In millions of dollars Fair value of foreign exchange forward contracts, net (liability) asset $ (4.8 ) $ 10.3 Potential net loss associated with foreign exchange forward contracts resulting from a hypothetical near-term adverse change in market rates of ten percent $ 10.9 $ 7.1 Our risk related to foreign exchange forward contracts is limited to the cost of replacing the contracts at prevailing market rates. Commodities Price Risk Management and Futures Contracts Our most significant raw material requirements include cocoa products, sugar, dairy products, peanuts and almonds. The cost of cocoa products and prices for related futures contracts historically have been subject to wide fluctuations attributable to a variety of factors. These factors include: Commodity market fluctuations; Currency exchange rates; Imbalances between supply and demand; The effect of weather on crop yield; Speculative influences; Trade agreements among producing and consuming nations; Political unrest in producing countries; and Changes in governmental agricultural programs and energy policies. We use futures and options contracts in combination with forward purchasing of cocoa products, sugar, corn sweeteners, natural gas, fuel oil and certain dairy products primarily to provide favorable pricing opportunities and flexibility in sourcing our raw material and energy requirements. We attempt to minimize the effect of future 39 price fluctuations related to the purchase of raw materials by using forward purchasing to cover future manufacturing requirements generally for 3 to 24 months. However, the dairy futures markets are not as developed as many of the other commodities futures markets and, therefore, it is not possible to hedge our costs for dairy products by entering into futures contracts to extend coverage for longer periods of time. We use fuel oil futures contracts to minimize price fluctuations associated with our transportation costs. Our commodity procurement practices are intended to reduce the risk of future price increases and provide visibility to future costs, but also may potentially limit our ability to benefit from possible price decreases. During 2009, the average cocoa futures contract prices increased compared with 2008, and traded in a range between $1.10 and $1.52 per pound, based on the prices of futures contracts traded on the IntercontinentalExchange. Cocoa futures prices during 2009 traded at prices which were near 30-year highs. The significant increase in cocoa futures prices reflected the impact of a weakening U.S. dollar as compared with other currencies, and an increase in asset allocation into commodity-based investments by various hedge funds. During 2009, dairy prices started the year near $.13 per pound and dropped to approximately $.10 per pound on a class II fluid milk basis. Prices were weak in the face of strong production of milk and dairy products, and sluggish demand worldwide. Our costs for certain dairy products may not necessarily reflect market price fluctuations because of our forward purchasing practices. We make or receive cash transfers to or from commodity futures brokers on a daily basis reflecting changes in the value of futures contracts on the IntercontinentalExchange or various other exchanges. These changes in value represent unrealized gains and losses. We report these cash transfers as a component of other comprehensive income. The cash transfers offset higher or lower cash requirements for the payment of future invoice prices of raw materials, energy requirements and transportation costs. Futures held in excess of the amount required to fix the price of unpriced physical forward contracts are effective as hedges of anticipated purchases. Commodity Position Sensitivity Analysis The following sensitivity analysis reflects our market risk to a hypothetical adverse market price movement of 10%, based on our net commodity positions at four dates spaced equally throughout the year. Our net commodity positions consist of the amount of futures contracts we hold over or under the amount of futures contracts we need to price unpriced physical forward contracts for the same commodities. Inventories, priced forward contracts and estimated anticipated purchases not yet under contract were not included in the sensitivity analysis calculations. We define a loss, for purposes of determining market risk, as the potential decrease in fair value or the opportunity cost resulting from the hypothetical adverse price movement. The fair values of net commodity positions reflect quoted market prices or estimated future prices, including estimated carrying costs corresponding with the future delivery period. For the years ended December 31, 2009 2008 Fair Value Market Risk (Hypothetical 10% Change) Fair Value Market Risk (Hypothetical 10% Change) In millions of dollars Highest long position $ (209.0 ) $ 20.9 $ (357.1 ) $ 35.7 Lowest long position (513.2 ) 51.3 (574.1 ) 57.4 Average position (long) (363.1 ) 36.3 (440.6 ) 44.1 The increase in fair values from 2008 to 2009 primarily reflected higher 2009 prices, slightly offset by a decrease in net commodity positions. The negative positions primarily resulted as unpriced physical forward contract futures requirements exceeded the amount of commodities futures that we held at certain points in time during the years. 40 USE OF ESTIMATES AND OTHER CRITICAL ACCOUNTING POLICIES Our consolidated financial statements are prepared in accordance with GAAP. In various instances, GAAP requires management to make estimates, judgments and assumptions that affect the amounts reported in the consolidated financial statements and accompanying notes. We believe that our most critical accounting policies and estimates relate to the following: Accounts Receivable Trade Accrued Liabilities Pension and Other Post-Retirement Benefits Plans Goodwill and Other Intangible Assets Commodities Futures Contracts Management has discussed the development, selection and disclosure of critical accounting policies and estimates with the Audit Committee of our Board of Directors. While we base estimates and assumptions on our knowledge of current events and actions we may undertake in the future, actual results may ultimately differ from these estimates and assumptions. We discuss our significant accounting policies in Note 1, Summary of Significant Accounting Policies . Accounts Receivable Trade In the normal course of business, we extend credit to customers that satisfy pre-defined credit criteria based upon the results of our recurring financial account reviews and our evaluation of the current and projected economic conditions. Our primary concentration of credit risk is associated with McLane Company, Inc., one of the largest wholesale distributors in the United States to convenience stores, drug stores, wholesale clubs and mass merchandisers. McLane Company, Inc. accounted for approximately 22.5% of our total accounts receivable as of December 31, 2009. As of December 31, 2009, no other customer accounted for more than 10% of our total accounts receivable. We believe that we have little concentration of credit risk associated with the remainder of our customer base. Accounts Receivable Trade, as shown on the Consolidated Balance Sheets, were net of allowances and anticipated discounts. An allowance for doubtful accounts is determined through analysis of the following: Aging of accounts receivable at the date of the financial statements; Assessments of collectability based on historical trends; and Evaluation of the impact of current and projected economic conditions. We monitor the collectability of our accounts receivable on an ongoing basis by analyzing aged accounts receivable, assessing the credit worthiness of our customers and evaluating the impact of reasonably likely changes in economic conditions that may impact credit risks. Estimates with regard to the collectability of accounts receivable are reasonably likely to change in the future. Information on our Accounts Receivable Trade, related expenses and assumptions is as follows: For the three-year period 2007-2009 In millions of dollars, except percents Average expense for potential uncollectible accounts $1.7 Average write-offs of uncollectible accounts $1.6 Allowance for doubtful accounts as a percentage of gross accounts receivable 1%-2% We recognize the provision for uncollectible accounts as selling, marketing and administrative expense in the Consolidated Statements of Income. 41 If we made reasonably possible near-term changes in the most material assumptions regarding collectability of accounts receivable, our annual provision could change within the following range: A reduction in expense of approximately $4.9 million; and An increase in expense of approximately $3.7 million. Changes in estimates for future uncollectible accounts receivable would not have a material impact on our liquidity or capital resources. Accrued Liabilities Accrued liabilities requiring the most difficult or subjective judgments include liabilities associated with marketing promotion programs and potentially unsaleable products. Liabilities associated with marketing promotion programs We recognize the costs of marketing promotion programs as a reduction to net sales along with a corresponding accrued liability based on estimates at the time of revenue recognition. Information on our promotional costs and assumptions is as follows: For the years ended December 31, 2009 2008 2007 In millions of dollars Promotional costs $ 721.5 $ 766.6 $ 702.1 We determine the amount of the accrued liability by: Analysis of programs offered; Historical trends; Expectations regarding customer and consumer participation; Sales and payment trends; and Experience with payment patterns associated with similar, previously offered programs. The estimated costs of these programs are reasonably likely to change in the future due to changes in trends with regard to customer and consumer participation, particularly for new programs and for programs related to the introduction of new products. Reasonably possible near-term changes in the most material assumptions regarding the cost of promotional programs could result in changes within the following range: A reduction in costs of approximately $13.1 million; and An increase in costs of approximately $5.6 million. Changes in these assumptions would affect net sales and income before income taxes. Over the three-year period ended December 31, 2009, actual promotion costs have not deviated from the estimated amounts by more than 2%. Changes in estimates related to the cost of promotional programs would not have a material impact on our liquidity or capital resources. Liabilities associated with potentially unsaleable products At the time of sale, we estimate a cost for the possibility that products will become aged or unsaleable in the future. The estimated cost is included as a reduction to net sales. A related accrued liability is determined using statistical analysis that incorporates historical sales trends, seasonal timing and sales patterns, and product movement at retail. 42 Estimates for costs associated with unsaleable products may change as a result of inventory levels in the distribution channel, current economic trends, changes in consumer demand, the introduction of new products and changes in trends of seasonal sales in response to promotional programs. Over the three-year period ended December 31, 2009, costs associated with aged or unsaleable products have amounted to approximately 2% of gross sales. Reasonably possible near-term changes in the most material assumptions regarding the estimates of such costs would have increased or decreased net sales and income before income taxes in a range from $1.0 million to $2.0 million. Over the three-year period ended December 31, 2009, actual costs have not deviated from our estimates by more than approximately 1%. Reasonably possible near-term changes in the estimates of costs associated with unsaleable products would not have a material impact on our liquidity or capital resources. Pension and Other Post-Retirement Benefits Plans Overview We sponsor a number of defined benefit pension plans. The primary plans are The Hershey Company Retirement Plan and The Hershey Company Retirement Plan for Hourly Employees. These are cash balance plans that provide pension benefits for most domestic employees hired prior to January 1, 2007. We monitor legislative and regulatory developments regarding cash balance plans, as well as recent court cases, for any impact on our plans. We also sponsor 2 primary post-retirement benefit plans. The health care plan is contributory, with participants contributions adjusted annually, and the life insurance plan is non-contributory. We fund domestic pension liabilities in accordance with the limits imposed by the Employee Retirement Income Security Act of 1974 and federal income tax laws. Beginning January 1, 2008, we complied with the funding requirements of the Pension Protection Act of 2006. We fund non-domestic pension liabilities in accordance with laws and regulations applicable to those plans. We broadly diversify our pension plan assets, consisting primarily of domestic and international common stocks and fixed income securities. Short-term and long-term liabilities associated with benefit plans are primarily determined based on actuarial calculations. These calculations consider payroll and employee data, including age and years of service, along with actuarial assumptions at the date of the financial statements. We take into consideration long-term projections with regard to economic conditions, including interest rates, return on assets and the rate of increase in compensation levels. With regard to liabilities associated with post-retirement benefit plans that provide health care and life insurance, we take into consideration the long-term annual rate of increase in the per capita cost of the covered benefits. We review the discount rate assumptions and may revise them annually. The expected long-term rate of return on assets assumption ( asset return assumption ) for funded plans is of a longer duration and revised only when long-term asset return projections demonstrate that need. An employer that is a business entity and sponsors one or more single-employer defined benefit plans is required to: Recognize the funded status of a benefit plan measured as the difference between plan assets at fair value and the benefit obligation in its statement of financial position. For a pension plan, the benefit obligation is the projected benefit obligation; for any other post-retirement benefit plan, such as a retiree health care plan, the benefit obligation is the accumulated post-retirement benefit obligation. Recognize as a component of other comprehensive income, net of tax, the gains or losses and prior service costs or credits that arise during the period but are not recognized as components of net periodic benefit cost. 43 Measure defined benefit plan assets and obligations as of the date of the employer fiscal year-end statement of financial position. Disclose in the notes to financial statements additional information about certain effects on net periodic benefit cost for the next fiscal year that arise from delayed recognition of the gains or losses, prior service costs or credits, and transition asset or obligation. Pension Plans Our pension plan costs and related assumptions were as follows: For the years ended December 31, 2009 2008 2007 In millions of dollars Net periodic pension benefit costs (income) $ 48.9 $ (17.4 ) $ (9.0 ) Assumptions: Average discount rate assumptions net periodic benefit cost calculation 6.4 % 6.3 % 5.8 % Average discount rate assumptions benefit obligation calculation 5.7 % 6.4 % 6.2 % Asset return assumptions 8.5 % 8.5 % 8.5 % Net Periodic Pension Benefit Costs We recorded net periodic pension benefit expense of $48.9 million in 2009. The increase from 2008 was primarily due to the significant decline in the value of pension assets during 2008 reflecting volatility and deterioration in financial market and economic conditions. We recorded net periodic pension benefit income in 2008 primarily due to the modifications announced in October 2006 which reduced future benefits under The Hershey Company Retirement Plan, The Hershey Company Retirement Plan for Hourly Employees and the Supplemental Executive Retirement Plan and the impact of a higher discount rate assumption as of December 31, 2007. Our periodic pension benefit costs in 2010 will be approximately $14 million lower due to the higher actual return on pension assets in 2009. Actuarial gains and losses may arise when actual experience differs from assumed experience or when we revise the actuarial assumptions used to value the plans obligations. We only amortize the unrecognized net actuarial gains and losses in excess of 10% of a respective plan projected benefit obligation, or the fair market value of assets, if greater. The estimated recognized net actuarial loss component of net periodic pension benefit expense for 2010 is $28.4 million. The 2009 recognized net actuarial loss component of net periodic pension benefit expense was $33.6 million. Projections beyond 2010 are dependent on a variety of factors such as changes to the discount rate and the actual return on pension plan assets. Average Discount Rate Assumption Net Periodic Benefit Costs (Income) The discount rate represents the estimated rate at which we could effectively settle our pension benefit obligations. In order to estimate this rate for 2009 and 2008, a single effective rate of discount was determined by our actuaries after discounting the pension obligation cash flows using the spot rate of matching duration from the Citigroup Pension Discount Curve. The use of a different discount rate assumption can significantly affect net periodic benefit cost (income): A one-percentage point decrease in the discount rate assumption would have increased 2009 net periodic pension benefit expense by $6.7 million. A one-percentage point increase in the discount rate assumption would have decreased 2009 net periodic pension benefit expense by $6.2 million. 44 Average Discount Rate Assumption Benefit Obligations The discount rate assumption to be used in calculating the amount of benefit obligations is determined in the same manner as the average discount rate assumption used to calculate net periodic benefit cost (income) as described above. We reduced our 2009 discount rate assumption due to the declining interest rate environment consistent with the duration of our pension plan liabilities. The use of a different discount rate assumption can significantly affect the amount of benefit obligations: A one-percentage point decrease in the discount rate assumption would have increased the December 31, 2009 pension benefits obligations by $100.2 million. A one-percentage point increase in the discount rate assumption would have decreased the December 31, 2009 pension benefits obligations by $85.5 million. Asset Return Assumptions We based the expected return on plan assets component of net periodic pension benefit costs (income) on the fair market value of pension plan assets. To determine the expected return on plan assets, we consider the current and expected asset allocations, as well as historical and expected returns on the categories of plan assets. The historical geometric average return over the 22 years prior to December 31, 2009 was approximately 8.3%. The actual return on assets was as follows: For the years ended December 31, 2009 2008 2007 Actual return (loss) on assets 21.2 % (24.1 )% 7.1 % The use of a different asset return assumption can significantly affect net periodic benefit cost (income): A one-percentage point decrease in the asset return assumption would have increased 2009 net periodic pension benefit expense by $8.7 million. A one-percentage point increase in the asset return assumption would have decreased 2009 net periodic pension benefit expense by $8.7 million. Our investment policies specify ranges of allocation percentages for each asset class. The ranges for the domestic pension plans were as follows: Asset Class Allocation Range Equity securities 58% 85% Debt securities 15% 42% Cash and certain other investments 0% 5% As of December 31, 2009, actual allocations were within the specified ranges. We expect the level of volatility in pension plan asset returns to be in line with the overall volatility of the markets and weightings within the asset classes. As of December 31, 2009 and 2008, the benefit plan fixed income assets were invested primarily in conventional instruments benchmarked to the Barclays Capital U.S. Aggregate Bond Index. For 2009 and 2008, minimum funding requirements for the plans were not material. However, we made contributions of $54.5 million in 2009 and $32.8 million in 2008 to improve the funded status of our qualified plans and for the payment of benefits under our non-qualified pension plans. These contributions were fully tax deductible. A one-percentage point change in the funding discount rate would not have changed the 2009 minimum funding requirements significantly for the domestic plans. For 2010, there are no significant minimum funding requirements for our pension plans and planned voluntary funding of our pension plans in 2010 is not material. 45 Post-Retirement Benefit Plans Other post-retirement benefit plan costs and related assumptions were as follows: For the years ended December 31, 2009 2008 2007 In millions of dollars Net periodic other post-retirement benefit cost $ 19.9 $ 21.9 $ 24.9 Assumptions: Average discount rate assumption 6.4 % 6.3 % 5.8 % The use of a different discount rate assumption can significantly affect net periodic other post-retirement benefit cost: A one-percentage point decrease in the discount rate assumption would have decreased 2009 net periodic other post-retirement benefit cost by $.5 million. A one-percentage point increase in the discount rate assumption would have increased 2009 net periodic other post-retirement benefit cost by $1.0 million. Other post-retirement benefit obligations and assumptions were as follows: December 31, 2009 2008 In millions of dollars Other post-retirement benefit obligation $ 324.6 $ 315.4 Assumptions: Benefit obligations discount rate assumption 5.7 % 6.4 % A one-percentage point decrease in the discount rate assumption would have increased the December 31, 2009 other post-retirement benefits obligations by $30.4 million. A one-percentage point increase in the discount rate assumption would have decreased the December 31, 2009 other post-retirement benefits obligations by $25.7 million. Goodwill and Other Intangible Assets We account for goodwill and other intangible assets by classifying intangible assets into three categories: (1) intangible assets with definite lives subject to amortization; (2) intangible assets with indefinite lives not subject to amortization; and (3) goodwill. For intangible assets with definite lives, impairment testing is required if conditions exist that indicate the carrying value may not be recoverable. For intangible assets with indefinite lives and for goodwill, impairment testing is required at least annually or more frequently if events or circumstances indicate that these assets might be impaired. We use a two-step process to evaluate goodwill for impairment. In the first step, we compare the fair value of each reporting unit with the carrying amount of the reporting unit, including goodwill. We estimate the fair value of the reporting unit based on discounted future cash flows. If the estimated fair value of the reporting unit is less than the carrying amount of the reporting unit, we complete a second step to determine the amount of the goodwill impairment that we should record. In the second step, we determine an implied fair value of the reporting unit goodwill by allocating the reporting unit fair value to all of its assets and liabilities other than goodwill (including any unrecognized intangible assets). We compare the resulting implied fair value of the goodwill to the carrying amount and record an impairment charge for the difference. The assumptions we used to estimate fair value are based on the past performance of each reporting unit and reflect the projections and assumptions that we use in current operating plans. We also consider assumptions that market participants may use. Such assumptions are subject to change due to changing economic and competitive conditions. 46 We perform annual impairment tests of goodwill at the beginning of the fourth quarter of each year or when circumstances arise that indicate a possible impairment might exist. We determined than none of our goodwill was impaired as of December 31, 2009. The fair value of our Godrej Hershey Ltd. reporting unit exceeded its carrying value by approximately 6%. As of December 31, 2009, the goodwill allocated to the reporting unit was approximately $79.6 million. The assumptions used to estimate fair value were based on the past performance of the reporting unit as well as the projections incorporated in our current operating plans. Significant assumptions and estimates included in our current operating plans were associated with sales growth, profitability, and related cash flows, along with cash flows associated with taxes and capital spending. The discount rate used to estimate fair value was risk adjusted in consideration of the economic conditions of the reporting unit. We also considered assumptions that market participants may use. By their nature, these projections and assumptions are uncertain. Potential events and circumstances that could have an adverse effect on our assumptions include the unavailability of raw or packaging materials or significant cost increases, pricing constraints and possible disruptions to our supply chain. The fair values of our other reporting units were substantially in excess of their carrying values. Our other intangible assets consist primarily of customer-related intangible assets, patents and trademarks obtained through business acquisitions. We amortize customer-related intangible assets and patents over their estimated useful lives. The useful lives of existing trademarks were determined to be indefinite and, therefore, we do not amortize them. We evaluate our trademarks for impairment by comparing the carrying amount of the assets to their estimated fair value. The fair value of trademarks is calculated using a relief from royalty payments methodology. This approach involves two steps. In the first step, we estimate reasonable royalty rates for each trademark. In the second step, we apply these royalty rates to a net sales stream and discount the resulting cash flows to determine fair value. This fair value is then compared with the carrying value of each trademark. If the estimated fair value is less than the carrying amount, we record an impairment charge to reduce the asset to its estimated fair value. The estimates of future cash flows are generally based on past performance of the brands and reflect net sales projections and assumptions for the brands that we use in current operating plans. We also consider assumptions that market participants may use. Such assumptions are subject to change due to changing economic and competitive conditions. We perform annual impairment tests of other intangible assets with indefinite lives at the beginning of the fourth quarter of each year or when circumstances arise that indicate a possible impairment might exist. We determined that none of our other intangible assets was impaired as of December 31, 2009. In December 2008, we recorded total non-cash impairment charges of $45.7 million. We determined that the carrying amounts of certain trademarks, primarily the Mauna Loa brand, exceeded their estimated fair value due to reduced expectations for future sales and cash flows compared with the valuations at the acquisition dates. Commodities Futures and Options Contracts We use futures and options contracts in combination with forward purchasing of cocoa products and other commodities primarily to reduce the risk of future price increases, provide visibility to future costs and take advantage of market fluctuations. Additional information with regard to accounting policies associated with commodities futures and options contracts and other derivative instruments is contained in Note 6, Derivative Instruments and Hedging Activities . Our gains (losses) on cash flow hedging derivatives were as follows: For the years ended December 31, 2009 2008 2007 In millions of dollars Net after-tax gains on cash flow hedging derivatives $ 78.3 $ 11.5 $ 6.8 Reclassification adjustments from accumulated other comprehensive loss to income 1.9 (34.1 ) .2 Hedge ineffectiveness gains (losses) recognized in cost of sales, before tax .2 (.1 ) (.5 ) 47 We reflected reclassification adjustments related to gains or losses on commodities futures and options contracts in cost of sales. No gains or losses on commodities futures and options contracts resulted because we discontinued a hedge due to the probability that the forecasted hedged transaction would not occur. We recognized no components of gains or losses on commodities futures and options contracts in income due to excluding such components from the hedge effectiveness assessment. The amount of net gains on cash flow hedging derivatives, including foreign exchange forward contracts and options, and commodities futures and options contracts, expected to be reclassified into earnings in the next 12 months was approximately $54.0 million after tax as of December 31, 2009. This amount was primarily associated with commodities futures contracts. OUTLOOK The outlook section contains a number of forward-looking statements, all of which are based on current expectations. Actual results may differ materially. Refer to Risk Factors beginning on page 10 for information concerning the key risks to achieving our future performance goals. We expect the economic environment to continue to be challenging in 2010. In this environment, we will continue to build our business by focusing on a consumer-driven approach to core brand investment and new product innovation in North America, along with investments in our strategic international businesses. We expect to increase advertising investment by 25% to 30% behind our core brands and new product introductions. We will also continue to invest in consumer insights, in-store selling, merchandising and programming to drive profitable growth for both our Company and our customers. We expect our cost structure to remain at elevated levels in 2010. Key commodity markets remain volatile and prices for many commodities are near multi-year highs. We have good visibility into our full-year cost structure for 2010. We also expect to continue to achieve productivity and efficiency improvements, along with price realization in 2010, resulting in modestly enhanced margins. For 2010, we expect to achieve net sales growth within our long-term objective of 3% to 5% and adjusted earnings per share-diluted growth within our long-term objective of 6% to 8%. Outlook for Global Supply Chain Transformation Program Total pre-tax charges and non-recurring project implementation costs over the last three years for the GSCT were $629.1 million. The GSCT was essentially complete as of December 31, 2009. However, the current trends of employee lump sum withdrawals from the defined benefit pension plans could result in additional non-cash pension settlement losses of $12 million to $18 million in 2010. In addition, the manufacturing facilities in Naugatuck, Connecticut; Reading, Pennsylvania; and Smiths Falls, Ontario have been closed and are being held for sale. Actual proceeds from the sale of these facilities could differ from expected proceeds which could cause additional charges or credits in 2010. SUBSEQUENT EVENTS In May 2009, the FASB issued a new standard effective for both interim and annual financial statements ending after June 15, 2009. It establishes general standards of accounting for and disclosure of events that occur after the balance sheet date but before financial statements are issued or are available to be issued. 48 We adopted this new standard as of July 5, 2009 and have evaluated all subsequent events through the date and time our financial statements were issued. The adoption of this standard did not have a material impact on our financial accounting or reporting. No subsequent events occurred during this reporting period that require recognition or disclosure in this filing. NEW ACCOUNTING PRONOUNCEMENTS In June 2009, the FASB issued two Statements of Financial Accounting Standards: No. 166, Accounting for Transfers of Financial Assets an amendment of FASB Statement No. 140 ( SFAS No. 166 ) and No. 167, Amendments to FASB Interpretation No. 46(R) ( SFAS No. 167 ). SFAS No. 166 addresses how information should be provided about transfers of financial assets; the effects of a transfer on a company financial position, performance and cash flows; and a transferor continuing involvement in transferred financial assets. SFAS No. 166 removes the concept of a qualifying special-purpose entity and modifies or eliminates certain other provisions related to transfers of financial assets. It also establishes additional requirements, including a requirement for enhanced disclosures to provide financial statement users with greater transparency. SFAS No. 167 amends certain requirements of FASB Interpretation No. 46 (revised December 2003), Consolidation of Variable Interest Entities, to improve financial reporting by enterprises involved with variable interest entities, and to provide more relevant and reliable information to users of financial statements. Each of these statements has now been included in the FASB Codification. SFAS No. 166 is now Topic 860 and SFAS No. 167 is now Topic 810. These standards are effective for us as of January 1, 2010; we believe there will be no significant impact on our consolidated financial statements upon adoption of these new accounting standards.
