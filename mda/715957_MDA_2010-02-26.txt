Dominion and Virginia Power undertake no obligation to update any forward-looking statement to reflect developments occurring after the statement is made. A CCOUNTING M ATTERS Critical Accounting Policies and Estimates Dominion and Virginia Power have identified the following accounting policies, including certain inherent estimates, that as a result of the judgments, uncertainties, uniqueness and complexities of the underlying accounting standards and operations involved, could result in material changes to their financial con - - 33 Table of Contents Management Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations, Continued dition or results of operations under different conditions or using different assumptions. Dominion and Virginia Power have discussed the development, selection and disclosure of each of these policies with the Audit Committee of their Board of Directors. Virginia Power Board of Directors also serves as its Audit Committee. A CCOUNTING FOR R EGULATED O PERATIONS The accounting for Virginia Power regulated electric and Dominion regulated gas operations differs from the accounting for nonregulated operations in that they are required to reflect the effect of rate regulation in their Consolidated Financial Statements. For regulated businesses subject to federal or state cost-of-service rate regulation, regulatory practices that assign costs to accounting periods may differ from accounting methods generally applied by nonregulated companies. When it is probable that regulators will permit the recovery of current costs through future rates charged to customers, these costs are deferred as regulatory assets that otherwise would be expensed by nonregulated companies. Likewise, regulatory liabilities are recognized when it is probable that regulators will require customer refunds through future rates or when revenue is collected from customers for expenditures that have yet to be incurred. Generally, regulatory assets and liabilities are amortized into income over the period authorized by the regulator. As discussed further in Note 2 to the Consolidated Financial Statements, in April 2007, Virginia Power reapplied accounting guidance for cost-based regulation to the Virginia jurisdiction of its generation operations resulting in a $259 million ($158 million after-tax) extraordinary charge and the reclassification of $195 million ($119 million after-tax) of unrealized gains from AOCI related to nuclear decommissioning trust funds. This established a $454 million long-term regulatory liability for amounts previously collected from Virginia jurisdictional customers and placed in external trusts (including income, losses and changes in fair value thereon) for the future decommissioning of Virginia Power nuclear generation stations, in excess of the related ARO. In connection with the reapplication of this guidance, Virginia Power prospectively changed certain of its accounting policies for the Virginia jurisdiction of its generation operations to those used by cost-of-service rate-regulated entities. Other than the extraordinary item previously discussed, the overall impact of these changes was not material to Virginia Power results of operations or financial condition in 2007. As discussed in Note 14 to the Consolidated Financial Statements, in February 2010, Virginia Power filed a revised Stipulation and Recommendation with the Virginia Commission that could resolve its pending rate proceedings in Virginia. Virginia Power 2009 results include a charge of $782 million ($477 million after-tax) representing its best estimate of the probable outcome of this matter. Of this amount, $700 million ($427 million after-tax) represents a partial refund of 2008 revenues and other amounts, and $82 million ($50 million after-tax) represents an expected refund of 2009 revenues collected from customers as a result of the implementation of a base rate increase that became effective on an interim basis on September 1, 2009. Of the total $782 million pre-tax charge, $523 million was recorded in operating revenue, $129 million was recorded in electric fuel and other energy-related purchases expense, and $130 million was recorded in other operations and maintenance expense in Virginia Power Consolidated Statement of Income. The charge resulted in a $259 million decrease in regulatory assets, reflecting the write off of $129 million of previously deferred fuel costs and $130 million of previously deferred RTO costs since recovery is no longer probable based on the proposed February 2010 Stipulation, as well as a $473 million increase in regulatory liabilities with the remainder recorded to other receivables and payables in Virginia Power Consolidated Balance Sheet. Dominion 2009 results include an additional charge of $12 million ($8 million after-tax) recorded in other operations and maintenance expense, reflecting the write-off of previously deferred RTO costs since recovery is no longer probable based on the proposed February 2010 Stipulation. The Companies evaluate whether or not recovery of their regulatory assets through future rates is probable and make various assumptions in their analyses. The expectations of future recovery are generally based on orders issued by regulatory commissions or historical experience, as well as discussions with applicable regulatory authorities. If recovery of a regulatory asset is determined to be less than probable, it will be written off in the period such assessment is made. In 2006, Dominion wrote off $166 million of its regulatory assets as a result of the planned sale of Peoples and Hope to Equitable since the recovery of those assets was no longer probable. In January 2008, Dominion and Equitable announced the termination of that agreement, primarily due to the continued delays in achieving final regulatory approvals. Dominion continued to seek other offers for the purchase of these utilities and in July 2008 entered into an agreement with the SteelRiver Buyer to sell Peoples and Hope and recognized a benefit of $47 million due to the re-establishment of certain of these regulatory assets. In September 2009, Dominion recorded a reduction to these regulatory assets of $22 million. The Companies currently believe the recovery of their regulatory assets is probable. See Notes 13 and 14 to the Consolidated Financial Statements. A SSET R ETIREMENT O BLIGATIONS Dominion and Virginia Power recognize liabilities for the expected cost of retiring tangible long-lived assets for which a legal obligation exists. These AROs are recognized at fair value as incurred, and are capitalized as part of the cost of the related long-lived assets. In the absence of quoted market prices, the Companies estimate the fair value of their AROs using present value techniques, in which they make various assumptions including estimates of the amounts and timing of future cash flows associated with retirement activities, credit-adjusted risk free rates and cost escalation rates. AROs currently reported in the Consolidated Balance Sheets were measured during a period of historically low interest rates. The impact on measurements of new AROs or remeasurements of existing AROs, using different cost escalation rates in the future, may be significant. When the Companies revise any assumptions used to calculate the fair value of existing AROs, they adjust the carrying amount of both the ARO liability and the related long-lived asset. The Companies accrete the ARO liability to reflect the passage of time. In 2009, 2008 and 2007, Dominion recognized $89 million, $94 million and $99 million, respectively, of accretion, and expects to incur $88 million in 2010. In 2009, 2008 and 2007, Virginia Power recognized 34 Table of Contents $35 million, $38 million and $38 million, respectively, of accretion, and expects to incur $36 million in 2010. Upon reapplication of accounting guidance for cost-based regulation to the Virginia jurisdiction of its generation operations, Virginia Power began recording accretion and depreciation associated with utility nuclear decommissioning AROs, formerly charged to expense, as an adjustment to the regulatory liability for nuclear decommissioning trust funds previously discussed, in order to match the recognition for rate-making purposes. A significant portion of the Companies AROs relates to the future decommissioning of their nuclear facilities. These nuclear decommissioning AROs are reported in the Dominion Generation segment. At December 31, 2009, Dominion nuclear decommissioning AROs totaled $1.3 billion, representing approximately 81% of its total AROs. At December 31, 2009, Virginia Power nuclear decommissioning AROs totaled $587 million, representing approximately 92% of its total AROs. Based on their significance, the following discussion of critical assumptions inherent in determining the fair value of AROs relates to those associated with the Companies nuclear decommissioning obligations. The Companies obtain from third-party specialists, periodic site-specific base year cost studies in order to estimate the nature, cost and timing of planned decommissioning activities for their nuclear plants. These cost studies are based on relevant information available at the time they are performed; however, estimates of future cash flows for extended periods of time are by nature highly uncertain and may vary significantly from actual results. In addition, the Companies cost estimates include cost escalation rates that are applied to the base year costs. The selection of these cost escalation rates is dependent on subjective factors which are considered to be a critical assumption. The Companies determine cost escalation rates, which represent projected cost increases over time, due to both general inflation and increases in the cost of specific decommissioning activities, for each nuclear facility. As a result of the updated decommissioning cost studies and applicable escalation rates obtained in 2009, Dominion recorded a decrease of $309 million in the nuclear decommissioning AROs of its units, including a $103 million ($62 million after-tax) reduction in other operations and maintenance expense due to a downward revision in the nuclear decommissioning ARO for a power station unit that is no longer in service. Virginia Power recorded a decrease of $119 million in the nuclear decommissioning AROs for its units. I NCOME T AXES Judgment and the use of estimates are required in developing the provision for income taxes and reporting of tax-related assets and liabilities. The interpretation of tax laws involves uncertainty, since tax authorities may interpret the laws differently. Ultimate resolution of income tax matters may result in favorable or unfavorable impacts to net income and cash flows and adjustments to tax-related assets and liabilities could be material. Given the uncertainty and judgment involved in the determination and filing of income taxes, there are standards for recognition and measurement, in financial statements, of positions taken, or expected to be taken, by an entity in its income tax returns. Positions taken by an entity in its income tax returns that are recognized in the financial statements must satisfy a more- likely-than-not recognition threshold, assuming that the position will be examined by tax authorities with full knowledge of all relevant information. At December 31, 2009, Dominion had $291 million and Virginia Power had $121 million of unrecognized tax benefits. For the majority of these unrecognized tax benefits, the ultimate deductibility is highly certain, but there is uncertainty about the timing of such deductibility. Deferred income tax assets and liabilities are provided, representing future effects on income taxes for temporary differences between the bases of assets and liabilities for financial reporting and tax purposes. Dominion and Virginia Power evaluate quarterly the probability of realizing deferred tax assets by reviewing a forecast of future taxable income and the availability of tax planning strategies that can be implemented, if necessary, to realize deferred tax assets. Failure to achieve forecasted taxable income or successfully implement tax planning strategies may affect the realization of deferred tax assets. The Companies establish a valuation allowance when it is more-likely-than-not that all, or a portion of, a deferred tax asset will not be realized. At December 31, 2009, Dominion had established $62 million of valuation allowances and Virginia Power had no valuation allowances. A CCOUNTING FOR D ERIVATIVE C ONTRACTS AND O THER I NSTRUMENTS AT F AIR V ALUE Dominion and Virginia Power use derivative contracts such as futures, swaps, forwards, options and FTRs to manage the commodity and financial market risks of their business operations. Derivative contracts, with certain exceptions, are reported in the Consolidated Balance Sheets at fair value. Accounting requirements for derivatives and related hedging activities are complex and may be subject to further clarification by standard-setting bodies. The majority of investments held in Dominion and Virginia Power nuclear decommissioning and Dominion rabbi and benefit plan trust funds are also subject to fair value accounting. See Notes 7 and 22 to the Consolidated Financial Statements for further information on these fair value measurements. Fair value is based on actively-quoted market prices, if available. In the absence of actively-quoted market prices, management seeks indicative price information from external sources, including broker quotes and industry publications. When evaluating pricing information provided by brokers and other pricing services, the Companies consider whether the broker is willing and able to trade at the quoted price, if the broker quotes are based on an active market, or an inactive market to the extent to which brokers are utilizing a particular model if pricing is not readily available. If pricing information from external sources is not available, or if the Companies believe that observable pricing information is not indicative of fair value, judgment is required to develop the estimates of fair value. In those cases the Companies must estimate prices based on available historical and near-term future price information and use of statistical methods, including regression analysis, that reflect their market assumptions. The Companies maximize the use of observable inputs and minimize the use of unobservable inputs when measuring fair value. 35 Table of Contents Management Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations, Continued U SE OF E STIMATES IN G OODWILL I MPAIRMENT T ESTING As of December 31, 2009, Dominion reported $3.4 billion of goodwill in its Consolidated Balance Sheet. A significant portion resulted from the acquisition of the former CNG in 2000. In April of each year, Dominion tests its goodwill for potential impairment, and performs additional tests more frequently if an event occurs or circumstances change in the interim that would more-likely-than-not reduce the fair value of a reporting unit below its carrying amount. The 2009, 2008 and 2007 annual tests did not result in the recognition of any goodwill impairment. As a result of the 2007 disposition of Dominion non-Appalachian E&P operations, goodwill was allocated to such operations based on the relative fair values of the E&P operations being disposed of and the Appalachian portion being retained. The impairment test performed on the goodwill allocated to the retained Appalachian operations showed no impairment. Also, in connection with the 2007 segment realignment, the goodwill allocated to Dominion three gas distribution subsidiaries was tested for impairment during the fourth quarter of 2007. This interim test did not result in the recognition of any goodwill impairment, as the estimated fair values of these businesses exceeded their respective carrying amounts. In December 2009, Dominion made the decision to retain Hope and include it with Dominion East Ohio in Dominion gas distribution business within the Dominion Energy segment. Goodwill was allocated from the Corporate and Other segment to the Dominion Energy segment based on the relative fair values of Hope and Peoples, which remained held-for-sale within the Dominion Corporate and Other segment. Dominion did not perform an interim impairment test as no events occurred that would more-likely-than-not reduce the reporting units fair values below their carrying values. In general, Dominion estimates the fair value of its reporting units by using a combination of discounted cash flows, and other valuation techniques that use multiples of earnings for peer group companies and analyses of recent business combinations involving peer group companies. For Dominion non-Appalachian E&P operations, Peoples and Hope and certain DCI operations, negotiated sales prices were used as fair value for the tests conducted in 2009, 2008 and 2007. Fair value estimates are dependent on subjective factors such as Dominion estimate of future cash flows, the selection of appropriate discount and growth rates, and the selection of peer group companies and recent transactions. These underlying assumptions and estimates are made as of a point in time; subsequent modifications, particularly changes in discount rates or growth rates inherent in Dominion estimates of future cash flows, could result in a future impairment of goodwill. Although Dominion has consistently applied the same methods in developing the assumptions and estimates that underlie the fair value calculations, such as estimates of future cash flows, and based those estimates on relevant information available at the time, such cash flow estimates are highly uncertain by nature and may vary significantly from actual results. If the estimates of future cash flows used in the most recent tests had been 10% lower, the resulting fair values would have still been greater than the carrying values of each of those reporting units tested, indicating that no impairment was present. U SE OF E STIMATES IN L ONG -L IVED A SSET I MPAIRMENT T ESTING Impairment testing for an individual or group of long-lived assets or for intangible assets with definite lives is required when circumstances indicate those assets may be impaired. When an asset carrying amount exceeds the undiscounted estimated future cash flows associated with the asset, the asset is considered impaired to the extent that the asset fair value is less than its carrying amount. Performing an impairment test on long-lived assets involves judgment in areas such as identifying circumstances that indicate an impairment may exist; identifying and grouping affected assets; and developing the undiscounted and discounted estimated future cash flows (used to estimate fair value in the absence of market-based value) associated with the asset, including probability weighting such cash flows to reflect expectations about possible variations in their amounts or timing and the selection of an appropriate discount rate. Although cash flow estimates are based on relevant information available at the time the estimates are made, estimates of future cash flows are, by nature, highly uncertain and may vary significantly from actual results. For example, estimates of future cash flows would contemplate factors, which may change over time, such as the expected use of the asset, including future production and sales levels, and expected fluctuations of prices of commodities sold and consumed. In the third quarter of 2008, Dominion tested SO 2 emissions allowances held for consumption, with a carrying amount of $144 million, as a result of a decline in the market value of such allowances resulting from the July 2008 D.C. Appeals Court decision vacating CAIR that affected certain emission allowance surrender ratios. Based on the results of Dominion test, including an analysis of recoverability through undiscounted cash flows from plant operations, no impairment charges were recognized. In December 2008, the court issued a decision to reinstate CAIR that resulted in an increase in the market value of SO 2 allowances. As a result of a decline in SO 2 allowance prices during 2009, Dominion updated its fair value assessment of excess allowances quarterly in 2009. Based on the result of these assessments, Dominion did not record any impairment adjustments. In 2006, Dominion tested Dresden for impairment and concluded that its carrying amount, as well as the estimated cost to complete, was recoverable based on the probability of continued construction and use at that time. As part of Dominion ongoing asset review to improve its return on invested capital, Dominion began the process of exploring the sale of Dresden in the second quarter of 2007. Non-binding indicative bids were received and based on its evaluation of these bids, Dominion believed that it was likely that Dresden would be sold rather than completed and operated in its merchant fleet. This change in intended use represented a triggering event for Dominion to evaluate whether it could recover the carrying amount of its investment in Dresden. This analysis indicated that the carrying amount of Dresden would not be recovered. As a result, in the second quarter of 2007, Dominion recognized a $387 million ($252 million after- tax) impairment charge to reduce Dresden carrying amount to its estimated fair value in connection with the planned sale of Dresden, which closed in September 2007. 36 Table of Contents E MPLOYEE B ENEFIT P LANS Dominion sponsors noncontributory defined benefit pension plans and other postretirement benefit plans for eligible active employees, retirees and qualifying dependents. The projected costs of providing benefits under these plans are dependent, in part, on historical information such as employee demographics, the level of contributions made to the plans and earnings on plan assets. Assumptions about the future, including the expected long-term rate of return on plan assets, discount rates applied to benefit obligations and the anticipated rate of increase in healthcare costs and participant compensation, also have a significant impact on employee benefit costs. The impact of changes in these factors, as well as differences between Dominion assumptions and actual experience, is generally recognized in the Consolidated Statements of Income over the remaining average service period of plan participants, rather than immediately. The expected long-term rates of return on plan assets, discount rates and healthcare cost trend rates are critical assumptions. Dominion determines the expected long-term rates of return on plan assets for pension plans and other postretirement benefit plans by using a combination of: Historical return analysis to determine expected future risk premiums, asset volatilities and correlations; Forward-looking return expectations derived from the yield on long-term bonds and the price earnings ratios of major stock market indices; Expected inflation and risk-free interest rate assumptions; and Investment allocation of plan assets. The strategic target asset allocation for Dominion pension funds is 34% U.S. equity, 12% non-U.S. equity, 22% fixed income, 7% real estate and 25% other, such as private equity investments. Strategic investment policies are established for each of Dominion prefunded benefit plans based upon periodic asset/liability studies. Factors considered in setting the investment policy include those mentioned above such as employee demographics, liability growth rates, future discount rates, the funded status of the plans and the expected long-term rate of return on plan assets. Deviations from the plans strategic allocation are a function of Dominion assessments regarding short-term risk and reward opportunities in the capital markets and/or short-term market movements which result in the plans actual asset allocations varying from the strategic target asset allocations. Through periodic rebalancing, actual allocations are brought back in line with the target. Dominion develops assumptions, which are then compared to the forecasts of other independent investment advisors to ensure reasonableness. An internal committee selects the final assumptions. Dominion calculated its pension cost using an expected long-term rate of return on plan assets assumption of 8.50% for 2009 and 2008, and 8.75% for 2007. Dominion calculated its other postretirement benefit cost using an expected long-term rate of return on plan assets assumption of 7.75% for 2009 and 2008, and 8.00% for 2007. The rate used in calculating other postretirement benefit cost is lower than the rate used in calculating pension cost because of differences in the relative amounts of various types of investments held as plan assets. Dominion determines discount rates from analyses of AA/Aa rated bonds with cash flows matching the expected payments to be made under its plans. The discount rates used to calculate pension cost and other postretirement benefit cost were 6.60% in 2009, compared to 6.60% and 6.50%, respectively, in 2008 and 6.20% and 6.10%, respectively, in 2007. Dominion selected a discount rate of 6.60% for determining its December 31, 2009 projected pension and other postretirement benefit obligations. Dominion establishes the healthcare cost trend rate assumption based on analyses of various factors including the specific provisions of its medical plans, actual cost trends experienced and projected, and demographics of plan participants. Dominion healthcare cost trend rate assumption as of December 31, 2009 is 8.0% and is expected to gradually decrease to 4.90% by 2060 and continue at that rate for years thereafter. The following table illustrates the effect on cost of changing the critical actuarial assumptions previously discussed, while holding all other assumptions constant: Increase in Net Periodic Cost Change in Actuarial Assumption Pension Benefits Other Postretirement Benefits (millions, except percentages) Discount rate (0.25 )% $ 12 $ 5 Long-term rate of return on plan assets (0.25 )% 12 2 Healthcare cost trend rate 1.00 % N/A 24 In addition to the effects on cost, at December 31, 2009, a 0.25% decrease in the discount rate would increase Dominion projected pension benefit obligation by $126 million and its accumulated postretirement benefit obligation by $45 million, while a 1.00% increase in the healthcare cost trend rate would increase its accumulated postretirement benefit obligation by $191 million. See Note 22 to the Consolidated Financial Statements for additional information. A CCOUNTING FOR G AS AND O IL O PERATIONS Dominion follows the full cost method of accounting for gas and oil E&P activities prescribed by the SEC. Under the full cost method, all direct costs of property acquisition, exploration and development activities are capitalized and subsequently depleted using the units-of-production method. Capitalized costs in the depletable base are subject to a ceiling test prescribed by the SEC. Dominion performs the ceiling test quarterly and recognizes asset impairments to the extent that total capitalized costs exceed the ceiling. In addition, gains or losses on the sale or other disposition of gas and oil properties are not recognized, unless the gain or loss would significantly alter the relationship between capitalized costs and proved reserves of natural gas and oil attributable to a cost pool. Dominion estimate of proved reserves requires a large degree of judgment and is dependent on factors such as historical data, engineering estimates of proved reserve quantities, estimates of the amount and timing of future expenditures to develop the proved reserves, and estimates of future production from the proved reserves. Dominion estimated proved reserves as of December 31, 2009 are based upon studies for each of its properties prepared by staff engineers and audited by Ryder Scott Company, L.P. Calculations were prepared using standard geological and engineering methods generally accepted by the petro - - 37 Table of Contents Management Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations, Continued leum industry and in accordance with SEC guidelines. Given the volatility of natural gas and oil prices, it is possible that Dominion estimate of discounted future net cash flows from proved natural gas and oil reserves that is used to calculate the ceiling could materially change in the near-term. The process to estimate reserves is imprecise, and estimates are subject to revision. If there is a significant variance in any of Dominion estimates or assumptions in the future and revisions to the value of its proved reserves are necessary, related depletion expense and the calculation of the ceiling test would be affected and recognition of natural gas and oil property impairments could occur. See Notes 2, 4 and 27 to the Consolidated Financial Statements for additional information. R EVENUE R ECOGNITION U NBILLED R EVENUE Virginia Power recognizes and records revenues when energy is delivered to the customer. The determination of sales to individual customers is based on the reading of their meters which is performed on a systematic basis throughout the month. At the end of each month, the amounts of electric energy delivered to customers, but not yet billed, is estimated and recorded as unbilled revenue. This estimate is reversed in the following month and actual revenue is recorded based on meter readings. Virginia Power customer receivables included $355 million and $341 million of accrued unbilled revenue at December 31, 2009 and 2008, respectively. The calculation of unbilled revenues is complex and includes numerous estimates and assumptions including historical usage, applicable customer rates, weather factors and total daily electric generation supplied adjusted for line losses. Changes in generation patterns, customer usage patterns and other factors, which are the basis for the estimates of unbilled revenues, could have a significant effect on the calculation and therefore on Virginia Power results of operations and financial condition. Other A CCOUNTING S TANDARDS AND P OLICIES During 2009, 2008 and 2007, Dominion and Virginia Power were required to adopt several new accounting standards, which are discussed in Note 3 to the Consolidated Financial Statements. D OMINION R ESULTS OF O PERATIONS Presented below is a summary of Dominion consolidated results: Year Ended December 31, 2009 $ Change 2008 $ Change 2007 (millions, except EPS) Net Income attributable to Dominion $ 1,287 $ (547 ) $ 1,834 $ (705 ) $ 2,539 Diluted EPS 2.17 (0.99 ) 3.16 (0.72 ) 3.88 Overview 2009 VS . 2008 Net income attributable to Dominion decreased by 30%. Unfavorable drivers include an impairment charge related to the carrying value of Dominion E&P properties due to declines in gas and oil prices during the first quarter of 2009 and a charge in connection with the proposed settlement of Virginia Power 2009 rate case proceedings. Favorable drivers include higher margins in Dominion merchant generation operations and a higher contribution from Dominion gas transmission operations due to the completion of the Cove Point expansion project. 2008 VS . 2007 Net income attributable to Dominion decreased by 28%. Unfavorable drivers include the absence of a $2.1 billion after-tax gain on the sale of Dominion U.S. non-Appalachian E&P business and the absence of ongoing earnings from this business due to the sale. Favorable drivers include the absence of the following items incurred in 2007: Charges related to the sale of the majority of its E&P operations; An impairment charge related to the sale of Dresden; An extraordinary charge in connection with the reapplication of accounting guidance for cost-based regulation to the Virginia jurisdiction of Virginia Power generation operations; and A charge in connection with the termination of a long-term power sales agreement at State Line. Additional favorable drivers include the reinstatement of annual fuel rate adjustments for the Virginia jurisdiction of Virginia Power generation operations effective July 1, 2007, a higher contribution from merchant generation operations and the reversal of deferred tax liabilities associated with the planned sale of Peoples and Hope. Diluted EPS decreased to $3.16 and includes $0.36 of share accretion resulting from the repurchase of shares in 2007 with proceeds received from the sale of the majority of Dominion E&P operations. 38 Table of Contents Analysis of Consolidated Operations Presented below are selected amounts related to Dominion results of operations: Year Ended) December 31, 2009 $ Change 2008 $ Change 2007 (millions) Operating Revenue $ 15,131 $ (1,159 ) $ 16,290 $ 1,474 $ 14,816 Electric fuel and other energy-related purchases 4,285 262 4,023 400 3,623 Purchased electric capacity 411 411 (28 ) 439 Purchased gas 2,381 (1,017 ) 3,398 623 2,775 Net Revenue 8,054 (404 ) 8,458 479 7,979 Other operations and maintenance 3,795 538 3,257 (868 ) 4,125 Gain on sale of U.S. non-Appalachian E&P business (42 ) 42 3,677 (3,635 ) Depreciation, depletion and amortization 1,139 105 1,034 (334 ) 1,368 Other taxes 491 (8 ) 499 (53 ) 552 Other income (loss) 181 239 (58 ) (160 ) 102 Interest and related charges 894 57 837 (324 ) 1,161 Income tax expense 612 (267 ) 879 (904 ) 1,783 Loss from discontinued operations, net of tax 2 (2 ) 6 (8 ) Extraordinary item, net of tax 158 (158 ) An analysis of Dominion results of operations follows: 2009 VS . 2008 Net Revenue decreased 5%, primarily reflecting: A $614 million decrease in net revenue from electric utility operations primarily due to a charge for the proposed settlement of Virginia Power 2009 rate case proceedings; An $86 million decrease in sales of gas production from E&P operations primarily reflecting the expiration of VPP royalty interests; and A $21 million decrease in net gas revenue from retail energy marketing operations primarily due to lower prices ($39 million), partially offset by higher volumes ($18 million). These decreases were partially offset by: A $161 million increase from merchant generation operations, primarily reflecting lower fuel expenses due to the impact of lower commodity prices ($190 million) and higher sales volumes primarily from fewer scheduled nuclear refueling outages and higher demand for natural gas generation ($143 million), partially offset by lower sales prices ($79 million) and increased fuel consumption ($93 million) at certain fossil generation facilities; A $158 million increase related to gas transmission operations largely due to the completion of the Cove Point expansion project; and A $70 million increase in net electric revenue from retail energy marketing operations primarily attributable to higher volumes ($36 million) and the acquisition of a retail energy marketing business in September 2008 ($34 million). Other operations and maintenance expense increased 17%, primarily reflecting the combined effects of: A $455 million ceiling test impairment charge related to the carrying value of E&P properties due to declines in natural gas and oil prices; A $142 million write-off of previously deferred RTO costs in connection with the proposed settlement of Virginia Power 2009 rate case proceedings; A $74 million increase in salaries, wages and benefits largely due to higher pension and other postretirement benefit costs; and A $69 million increase reflecting the absence of the net benefit recorded in 2008 related to the re-establishment of a regulatory asset in connection with the planned sale of Peoples and Hope ($47 million) and a 2009 charge due to a reduction in this regulatory asset ($22 million); partially offset by A $103 million downward revision in the nuclear decommissioning ARO for a power station unit that is no longer in service; The absence of a $59 million charge related to the impairment of a DCI investment sold in 2008; and A $29 million decrease largely due to the deferral of transmission-related expenditures collectible under certain rate adjustment clauses. DD&A increased 10%, principally due to higher depreciation from property additions ($100 million) and higher amortization due to increased consumption of emissions allowances ($37 million), partially offset by decreased DD&A reflecting lower gas and oil production ($19 million) and a decrease in DD&A rates ($28 million) at Dominion E&P properties. Other income increased $239 million primarily due to the impact of net realized gains (including investment income) on merchant nuclear decommissioning trust funds in 2009 as compared to net realized losses (net of investment income) in 2008. Interest and related charges increased 7%, primarily due to the impact of additional borrowings ($34 million) and the absence of a $23 million benefit related to the redemption of Virginia Power Callable and Puttable Enhanced Securities in 2008. Income tax expense decreased by 30%, primarily reflecting lower pre-tax income in 2009. 2008 VS . 2007 Net Revenue increased 6%, primarily reflecting: A $500 million increase from merchant generation operations, primarily reflecting higher realized sales prices for nuclear and fossil operations ($500 million) and the absence of a charge related to the termination of a long-term power sales agreement at State Line in 2007 ($231 million), partially offset by lower overall sales volumes due to outages at certain fossil and nuclear generating facilities ($105 million), increased fuel expenses primarily reflecting the impact of higher commodity prices ($54 million) and increased fuel consumption ($72 million) at certain fossil generation facilities; A $453 million increase in net revenue from electric utility operations resulting primarily from the reinstatement of annual fuel rate adjustments, effective July 1, 2007, for the Virginia jurisdiction of Virginia Power generation operations, with deferred fuel accounting for over- or under-recoveries of fuel costs; and 39 Table of Contents Management Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations, Continued A $129 million increase in sales of gas production from Dominion remaining E&P operations, primarily due to: A $70 million increase in sales from Appalachian properties due to higher prices ($51 million) and increased production ($19 million); and Increased production associated with VPP royalty interests ($59 million). These increases were partially offset by: A $656 million decrease due to the sale of the majority of U.S. E&P operations in 2007, reflecting the absence of $1.4 billion of net revenue from these operations, partially offset by the absence of a $541 million charge predominantly due to the discontinuance of hedge accounting for certain gas and oil derivatives and subsequent changes in the fair value of these derivatives; and a $171 million charge primarily due to the termination of VPP agreements in connection with the sale. Other operations and maintenance expense decreased 21%, primarily reflecting the combined effects of: A $443 million decrease reflecting the sale of the majority of U.S. E&P operations, including the absence of charges incurred in 2007 in connection with the sale; The absence of a $387 million impairment charge in 2007 related to the sale of Dresden; and The absence of $54 million of litigation-related charges in 2007. Gain on sale of U.S. non-Appalachian E&P business primarily reflects the absence of the gain of $3.6 billion resulting from the completion of the sale of Dominion U.S. non-Appalachian E&P business in 2007. DD&A decreased 24%, principally due to decreased gas and oil production resulting from the sale of the majority of U.S. E&P operations in 2007, partially offset by an increase in rates and production from remaining E&P operations, property additions and an increase in depreciation rates for utility generation assets. Other taxes decreased 10%, primarily due to lower severance and property taxes resulting from the sale of the majority of U.S. E&P operations in 2007. Other income (loss) was a loss of $58 million in 2008 as compared to income of $102 million in 2007, primarily due to higher other-than-temporary impairments for nuclear decommissioning trust investments. Interest and related charges decreased 28%, resulting principally from the absence of charges related to the early extinguishment of outstanding debt associated with Dominion debt tender offer completed in July 2007 and lower interest rates on variable rate debt. Income tax expense decreased by 51%, primarily due to lower pre-tax income in 2008 largely reflecting the absence of the gain realized in 2007 from the sale of Dominion U.S. non-Appalachian E&P business. Extraordinary item reflects the absence of a $158 million after-tax charge in 2007 in connection with the reapplication of guidance for accounting for certain types of regulation to the Virginia jurisdiction of Virginia Power generation operations. Outlook In order to deliver favorable returns to investors, Dominion strategy is to focus on its regulated businesses while maintaining upside potential in well-positioned nonregulated businesses. The goals of this strategy are to provide earnings per share growth, a growing dividend and stable credit ratings. In 2010, Dominion believes its operating businesses will provide stable growth in net income on a per share basis, including the impact of higher expected average shares outstanding. Dominion anticipated 2010 results reflect the following significant factors: The absence of an impairment charge in 2009 related to the carrying value of Dominion E&P properties due to declines in gas and oil prices; The absence of a charge in 2009 in connection with the proposed settlement of Virginia Power 2009 rate case proceedings; A benefit from rate adjustment clauses associated with the recovery of construction-related financing costs for Bear Garden and Virginia City Hybrid Energy Center; Minimal exposure to commodity prices reflecting hedges in place due to Dominion commodities hedging program; Favorable interest rates reflecting hedges in place for Dominion and Virginia Power planned debt issuances in 2010; The planned monetization of Dominion Marcellus Shale acreage with proceeds used to offset its anticipated 2010 equity financing needs; Implementation of operations and maintenance cost-containment measures; and An expected after-tax loss, as well as after-tax expenses, including transaction and benefit-related costs, in connection with the February 2010 sale of Peoples discussed in Note 4 to the Consolidated Financial Statements. If the final resolution of Virginia Power 2009 rate case proceedings differs materially from management expectations it could adversely affect Dominion results of operations, financial condition and cash flows. See Forward-Looking Statements for additional factors that could cause actual results to differ materially from predicted results.

See Note 27 to the Consolidated Financial Statements for discussion of these items. S ALE OF U.S. E&P B USINESS The sale of Dominion U.S. non-Appalachian E&P business reflects the $2.1 billion after-tax gain recognized in 2007 on the sale, partially offset by charges related to the divestitures as well as charges associated with the early retirement of debt with proceeds from the sale. The 2008 amount reflects post-closing adjustments to the gain on the sale. See Note 4 to the Consolidated Financial Statements for discussion of these items. P EOPLES O PERATIONS Income from Peoples decreased $45 million in 2009 as compared to 2008 and increased $26 million in 2008 as compared to 2007 primarily reflecting a $47 million ($28 million after-tax) benefit in 2008 from the re-establishment of certain regulatory assets in connection with the agreement to sell these subsidiaries to the SteelRiver Buyer. Regulatory assets of $166 million ($104 million after-tax) were written off in 2006 in connection with the previous sales agreement with Equitable. See Notes 4 and 6 to the Consolidated Financial Statements for discussion of these items. O THER C ORPORATE O PERATIONS The net expenses associated with other corporate operations for 2009 increased by $93 million as compared to 2008, primarily due to the absence of the following 2008 items: Tax benefits due to the reversal of deferred tax liabilities associated with Peoples and Hope; partially offset by Impairment charges related to the disposition of certain DCI investments. The net expenses associated with other corporate operations for 2008 increased by $27 million as compared to 2007, primarily reflecting a decrease in tax benefits, higher interest expense and the absence of interest income earned on the proceeds received from the sale of Dominion non-Appalachian E&P business in 2007. The decrease in tax benefits primarily reflects the net impact of the following items: A decrease in state tax benefits, including the impact of Massachusetts tax legislation enacted in July 2008; and The absence of tax benefits from the elimination of valuation allowances on federal and state tax loss carryforwards in 2007; partially offset by An increase in tax benefits due to the reversal of deferred tax liabilities associated with Peoples and Hope in 2008. The increase in net expenses was partially offset by the impact of lower impairment charges in 2008 related to the disposition of certain DCI investments. S ELECTED I NFORMATION E NERGY T RADING A CTIVITIES Dominion engages in energy trading, marketing and hedging activities to complement its integrated energy businesses and facilitate its risk management activities. As part of these operations, Dominion enters into contracts for purchases and sales of energy-related commodities, including electricity, natural gas and other energy-related products. Settlements of contracts may require physical delivery of the underlying commodity or cash settlement. Dominion also enters into contracts with the objective of benefiting from changes in prices. For example, after entering into a contract to purchase a commodity, Dominion typically enters into a sales contract, or a combination of sales contracts, with quantities and delivery or settlement terms that are identical or very similar to those of the purchase contract. When the purchase and sales contracts are settled either by physical delivery of the underlying commodity or by net cash settlement, Dominion may receive a net cash margin (a realized gain), or may pay a net cash margin (a realized loss). Dominion continually monitors its contract positions, considering location and timing of delivery or settlement for each energy commodity in relation to market price activity. A summary of the changes in the unrealized gains and losses recognized for Dominion energy-related derivative instruments held for trading purposes follows: Amount (millions) Net unrealized gain at December 31, 2008 $ 43 Contracts realized or otherwise settled during the period (40 ) Net unrealized gain at inception of contracts initiated during the period Change in unrealized gains and losses 39 Changes in unrealized gains and losses attributable to changes in valuation techniques Net unrealized gain at December 31, 2009 $ 42 The balance of net unrealized gains and losses recognized for Dominion energy-related derivative instruments held for trading purposes at December 31, 2009, is summarized in the following table based on the approach used to determine fair value: Maturity Based on Contract Settlement or Delivery Date(s) Source of Fair Value 2010 2011 - 2012 2013 - 2014 2015 and thereafter Total (millions) Actively-quoted Level 1 (1) $ 8 $ 7 $ $ $ 15 Other external sources Level 2 (2) 24 (11 ) 13 Models and other valuation methods Level 3 (3) 4 10 1 (1 ) 14 Total $ 36 $ 6 $ 1 $ (1 ) $ 42 (1) Values represent observable unadjusted quoted prices for traded instruments in active markets.

Analysis of Consolidated Operations Presented below are selected amounts related to Virginia Power results of operations: Year Ended December 31, 2009 $ Change 2008 $ Change 2007 (millions) Operating Revenue $ 6,584 $ (350 ) $ 6,934 $ 753 $ 6,181 Electric fuel and other energy-related purchases 2,972 265 2,707 319 2,388 Purchased electric capacity 409 (1 ) 410 (19 ) 429 Net Revenue 3,203 (614 ) 3,817 453 3,364 Other operations and maintenance 1,623 218 1,405 8 1,397 Depreciation and amortization 641 33 608 40 568 Other taxes 191 8 183 10 173 Other income 104 52 52 (3 ) 55 Interest and related charges 349 40 309 5 304 Income tax expense 147 (353 ) 500 129 371 Extraordinary item, net of tax 158 (158 ) An analysis of Virginia Power results of operations follows: 2009 VS . 2008 Net Revenue decreased 16%, primarily due to a charge for the proposed settlement of the 2009 rate case proceedings. Other operations and maintenance expense increased 16%, primarily reflecting: A $130 million write-off of previously deferred RTO costs in connection with the proposed settlement of Virginia Power 2009 rate case proceedings; A $64 million increase in outage costs related to scheduled outages at certain nuclear and fossil generating facilities; A $43 million increase resulting from higher salaries, wages and benefits largely due to higher pension and other postretirement benefit costs, and other general and administrative costs; and A $28 million decrease in gains from the sale of emissions allowances; partially offset by A $29 million decrease largely due to the deferral of transmission-related expenditures collectible under certain rate adjustment clauses. Depreciation and amortization expense increased 5%, primarily due to property additions. Other income increased by $52 million primarily due to an increase in the equity component of AFUDC as a result of construction and expansion projects. Interest and related charges increased 13%, primarily due to the absence of a $23 million benefit related to the redemption of Virginia Power Callable and Puttable Enhanced Securities in 2008, and a $17 million impact largely due to the impact from additional borrowings. Income tax expense decreased 71%, reflecting lower pre-tax income in 2009. 2008 VS . 2007 Net Revenue increased 13%, primarily reflecting the reinstatement of annual fuel rate adjustments, effective July 1, 2007, for the Virginia jurisdiction of Virginia Power generation operations, with deferred fuel accounting for over- or under-recoveries of fuel costs. Other operations and maintenance expense increased 1%, primarily reflecting: A $69 million increase resulting from higher salaries, wages and other benefits expenses and other general and administrative costs; partially offset by A $58 million decrease in outage costs resulting from a reduction in scheduled outages at certain electric generating facilities. Depreciation and amortization expense increased 7%, primarily due to an increase in depreciation rates for generation assets ($36 million) and property additions ($15 million), partially offset by an $11 million decrease in amortization expense primarily associated with lower consumption of emissions allowances. Interest and related charges increased 2%, primarily due to a $43 million impact from additional borrowings, partially offset by a $23 million benefit related to the redemption of Virginia Power Callable and Puttable Enhanced Securities due to a difference between the amount of interest expense accrued and the amount of interest expense paid and lower interest rates on variable rate debt ($15 million). 44 Table of Contents Income tax expense increased 35%, reflecting higher pre-tax income in 2008. Extraordinary item reflects the absence of a $158 million after-tax charge in 2007 in connection with the reapplication of accounting guidance for cost-based regulation to the Virginia jurisdiction of Virginia Power generation operations. Outlook Virginia Power expects to provide stable growth in net income in 2010. Virginia Power anticipated 2010 results reflect the following significant factors: The absence of a charge in 2009 in connection with the proposed settlement of Virginia Power 2009 rate case proceedings; A benefit from rate adjustment clauses associated with the recovery of construction-related financing costs for Bear Garden and Virginia City Hybrid Energy Center; and Favorable interest rates reflecting hedges in place for Virginia Power planned debt issuances in 2010. If the final resolution of Virginia Power 2009 rate case proceedings differs materially from management expectations it could adversely affect Virginia Power results of operations, financial condition and cash flows.

L IQUIDITY AND C APITAL R ESOURCES Dominion and Virginia Power depend on both internal and external sources of liquidity to provide working capital and to fund capital requirements. Short-term cash requirements not met by cash provided by operations are generally satisfied with proceeds from short-term borrowings. Long-term cash needs are met through issuances of debt and/or equity securities. At December 31, 2009, Dominion had $3.3 billion of unused capacity under its credit facilities, including $2.3 billion of unused capacity under a joint credit facility available to Virginia Power. See additional discussion under Credit Facilities and Short-Term Debt . A summary of Dominion cash flows is presented below: Year Ended December 31, 2009 2008 2007 (millions) Cash and cash equivalents at beginning of year $ 71 $ 287 $ 142 Cash flows provided by (used in): Operating activities 3,786 2,676 (230 ) Investing activities (3,695 ) (3,490 ) 10,192 Financing activities (112 ) 598 (9,817 ) Net increase (decrease) in cash and cash equivalents (21 ) (216 ) 145 Cash and cash equivalents at end of year (1) $ 50 $ 71 $ 287 (1) 2009, 2008 and 2007 amounts include $2 million, $5 million and $4 million, respectively, of cash classified as held for sale in Dominion Consolidated Balance Sheets. 46 Table of Contents A summary of Virginia Power cash flows is presented below: Year Ended December 31, 2009 2008 2007 (millions) Cash and cash equivalents at beginning of year $ 27 $ 49 $ 18 Cash flows provided by (used in): Operating activities 1,970 1,235 1,216 Investing activities (2,568 ) (2,003 ) (1,306 ) Financing activities 590 746 121 Net increase (decrease) in cash and cash equivalents (8 ) (22 ) 31 Cash and cash equivalents at end of year $ 19 $ 27 $ 49 Operating Cash Flows In 2009, net cash provided by Dominion operating activities increased by approximately $1.1 billion due to higher deferred fuel and gas cost recoveries, higher margins in its merchant generation and gas transmission operations, and a favorable impact from changes in customer receivables as a result of lower fuel and gas prices. The increase was partially offset by cash outflows related to collateral requirements and higher income tax payments as a result of higher estimated taxable income, which included a projected taxable gain from the planned sale of Peoples and Hope that was expected to close in 2009. In 2009, net cash provided by Virginia Power operating activities increased by $735 million, primarily due to higher deferred fuel cost recoveries in its Virginia jurisdiction and a favorable change in customer receivables, partially offset by higher income tax payments. Virginia Power believes that its operations provide a stable source of cash flow to contribute to planned levels of capital expenditures and provide dividends to Dominion. The Companies operations are subject to risks and uncertainties that may negatively impact the timing or amounts of operating cash flows which are discussed in Item 1A. Risk Factors. C REDIT R ISK Dominion exposure to potential concentrations of credit risk results primarily from its energy marketing and price risk management activities.

In 2009, net cash used in Virginia Power investing activities increased by $565 million, primarily reflecting an increase in capital expenditures for generation and transmission construction projects, including the Virginia City Hybrid Energy Center. Financing Cash Flows and Liquidity Dominion and Virginia Power rely on banks and capital markets as significant sources of funding for capital requirements not satisfied by cash provided by their operations. As discussed in Credit Ratings , the Companies ability to borrow funds or issue securities and the return demanded by investors are affected by credit ratings. In addition, the raising of external capital is subject to certain regulatory requirements, including registration with the SEC and, in the case of Virginia Power, approval by the Virginia Commission. Each of the Companies meets the definition of a well-known seasoned issuer under SEC rules governing the registration, communications and offering processes under the Securities Act of 1933. The rules provide for a streamlined shelf registration process to provide registrants with timely access to capital. This allows the Companies to use automatic shelf registration statements to register any offering of securities, other than those for business combination transactions. In 2009, net cash used in Dominion financing activities was $112 million as compared to net cash provided by financing activities of $598 million in 2008. This change is primarily due to higher dividend payments, and lower net debt issuances as a result of higher cash inflows from its operating activities, partially offset by increased proceeds from common stock issuances. In 2009, net cash provided by Virginia Power financing activities decreased by $156 million, primarily due to lower net debt issuances as a result of higher cash flow from operations. C REDIT F ACILITIES AND S HORT -T ERM D EBT Dominion and Virginia Power use short-term debt to fund working capital requirements, as a bridge to long-term debt financing and as bridge financing for acquisitions, if applicable. The levels of borrowing may vary significantly during the course of the year, depending upon the timing and amount of cash requirements not satisfied by cash from operations. In addition, Dominion utilizes cash and letters of credit to fund collateral requirements under its commodities hedging program. Collateral requirements are impacted by commodity prices, hedging levels, Dominion credit quality and the credit quality of Dominion counterparties. Virginia Power short-term financing is supported by a five-year joint revolving credit facility in which it participates with Dominion. This credit facility is being used for working capital, as support for the combined commercial paper programs of the Companies and for other general corporate purposes. Dominion has two other facilities as detailed in the following table. Commercial paper, bank loans, and letters of credit outstanding, as well as capacity available under credit facilities as of December 31, 2009 were as follows: Facility Limit Outstanding Commercial Paper Outstanding Bank Loans Outstanding Letters of Credit Facility Capacity Available (millions) Five-year joint revolving credit facility (1) $ 2,872 $ 442 $ $ 153 $ 2,277 Five-year Dominion credit facility (2) 1,700 353 500 19 828 Five-year Dominion bilateral facility (3) 200 32 168 Totals $ 4,772 $ 795 $ 500 $ 204 $ 3,273 (1) This credit facility was entered into February 2006 and terminates in February 2011. This credit facility can be used to support bank borrowings and the issuance of commercial paper, as well as to support up to $1.5 billion of letters of credit. At December 31, 2009, total outstanding commercial paper was $442 million, all of which were Virginia Power borrowings. At December 31, 2009, total outstanding letters of credit under the facility were $153 million, of which $104 million were issued on Virginia Power behalf. (2) This credit facility was entered into August 2005 and terminates in August 2010. This facility can be used to support bank borrowings, the issuance of letters of credit and commercial paper. (3) This facility was entered into December 2005 and terminates in December 2010. This credit facility can be used to support commercial paper and letter of credit issuances. In addition to the credit facility commitments disclosed above, Virginia Power also has a five-year $120 million credit facility that terminates in February 2011, which supports certain of its tax-exempt financings. Dominion and Virginia Power plan to replace their existing credit facilities during the second or third quarter of 2010. They expect to operate with credit facilities ranging from $3.0 to $3.5 billion. The Companies do not expect the reduction in the size of their credit facilities to negatively impact their ability to fund their operations. In connection with commodity hedging activities, the Companies are required to provide collateral to counterparties under some circumstances. Under certain collateral arrangements, the Companies may satisfy these requirements by electing to either deposit cash, post letters of credit or, in some cases, utilize other forms of security. From time to time, the Companies vary the form of collateral provided to counterparties after weighing the costs and benefits of various factors associated with the different forms of collateral. These factors include short-term borrowing and short-term investment rates, the spread over these short-term rates at which the Companies can issue commercial paper, balance sheet impacts, the costs and fees of alternative collateral postings with these and other counterparties and overall liquidity management objectives. In February 2010, Dominion completed the sale of Peoples and netted after-tax proceeds of approximately $542 million, which it used to reduce debt. 48 Table of Contents L ONG -T ERM D EBT During 2009, Dominion and Virginia Power issued the following long-term debt: Type Principal Rate Maturity Issuing Company (millions) Senior notes $ 500 5.20% 2019 Dominion Enhanced junior subordinated notes 685 8.375% 2064 (1) Dominion Senior notes 350 5.00% 2019 Virginia Power Total notes issued $ 1,535 (1) Subject to extensions to no later than 2079. Additionally, in May 2009, Dominion Brayton Point power station borrowed $50 million in connection with the Massachusetts Development Finance Agency Solid Waste Disposal Revenue Refunding Bonds Series 2009, which mature in 2042 and bear a coupon rate of 5.75% for the first ten years, after which they will bear interest at a market rate to be determined at that time, using a remarketing process. The proceeds were used to refinance certain qualifying improvements at Brayton Point. In May 2009, Virginia Power borrowed $40 million in connection with the Economic Development Authority of the County of Chesterfield Pollution Control Refunding Revenue Bonds, Series 2009 A, which mature in 2023 and bear a coupon rate of 5.0%. The proceeds were used to refund the principal amount of the Industrial Development Authority of the County of Chesterfield Money Market Municipals TM Pollution Control Revenue Bonds, Series 1985 that would otherwise have matured in October 2009. In May 2009, Virginia Power borrowed $70 million in connection with the Economic Development Authority of York County, Virginia Pollution Control Refunding Revenue Bonds, Series 2009 A, which mature in 2033 and bear an initial coupon rate of 4.05% for the first five years, after which they will bear interest at a market rate to be determined at that time, using a remarketing process. The proceeds were used to refund the principal amount of the Industrial Development Authority of York County, Virginia Money Market Municipals TM Pollution Control Revenue Bonds, Series 1985 that would otherwise have matured in July 2009. In September 2009, Virginia Power borrowed $60 million in connection with the $160 million Industrial Development Authority of Wise County Solid Waste and Sewage Disposal Revenue Bonds, Series 2009 A, which mature in 2040 and bear interest during the initial period at a variable rate. Due to unfavorable market conditions, Virginia Power acquired the $60 million in bonds upon issuance in September 2009 with the intention of remarketing them to a third party at a later time. Proceeds will be used to finance qualifying facilities at the Virginia City Hybrid Energy Center. At December 31, 2009, these bonds had not been remarketed and thus are eliminated in consolidation, along with the investment. Including the amounts discussed above, during 2009, Dominion and Virginia Power repaid $447 million and $126 million, respectively, of long-term debt and notes payable. I SSUANCE OF C OMMON S TOCK In January 2009, Dominion entered into sales agency agreements pursuant to which it may offer from time to time up to $400 million aggregate amount of its common stock. Sales of common stock can be made by means of privately negotiated transactions, as transactions on the New York Stock Exchange at market prices or in such other transactions as are agreed upon by the Company and the sales agents and in conformance with applicable securities laws. During 2009, Dominion issued 14 million shares of common stock for cash proceeds of $456 million. Dominion issued 6.2 million shares through at-the-market issuances under its sales agency agreements and received cash proceeds of $191 million, net of fees and commissions paid of $2 million. Following these issuances, Dominion has the ability to issue up to $207 million of stock under sales agency agreements. Dominion also issued 76,000 shares of its common stock to its officers and directors under a private placement program for aggregate consideration of approximately $2 million. The remainder of the shares issued and cash proceeds received during 2009 were through Dominion Direct , employee savings plans and the exercise of employee stock options. Dominion anticipates a need for $400 million of external common equity in 2010. This need will be met by the issuance of common stock or in whole or in part by proceeds, if any in 2010, from the planned monetization of Dominion Marcellus Shale acreage. In February 2010, Dominion began purchasing its common stock on the open market with proceeds received through Dominion Direct and employee savings plans, rather than issuing additional new common shares. Additionally, in February 2009, Dominion issued approximately 1.6 million shares of common stock to an existing holder of its senior notes, in a privately negotiated transaction, in exchange for approximately $56 million of the principal of two series of its outstanding senior notes, which were retired. The transaction was exempt from registration pursuant to Section 3(a)(9) of the Securities Act and no commission or remuneration was paid in connection with the exchange. In 2009, Virginia Power issued 31,877 shares of its common stock to Dominion reflecting the conversion of $1 billion of short-term demand note borrowings from Dominion to equity. Credit Ratings Credit ratings are intended to provide banks and capital market participants with a framework for comparing the credit quality of securities and are not a recommendation to buy, sell or hold securities. Dominion and Virginia Power believe that their current credit ratings provide sufficient access to the capital markets. However, disruptions in the banking and capital markets not specifically related to Dominion and Virginia Power may affect their ability to access these funding sources or cause an increase in the return required by investors. Both quantitative (financial strength) and qualitative (business or operating characteristics) factors are considered by the credit rating agencies in establishing an individual company credit rating. Credit ratings should be evaluated independently and are subject to revision or withdrawal at any time by the assigning rating organization. The credit ratings for Dominion and Virginia Power are most affected by each company financial profile, mix 49 Table of Contents Management Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations, Continued of regulated and nonregulated businesses and respective cash flows, changes in methodologies used by the rating agencies and event risk, if applicable, such as major acquisitions or dispositions. In December 2009, Fitch published a report that announced a global cross-sector change in its criteria for rating hybrid and other equity capital-like securities. In January 2010, Fitch lowered its credit ratings for Virginia Power preferred stock and Dominion junior subordinated debt securities and enhanced junior subordinated notes reflecting a revision in Fitch ratings methodology such that it now rates these securities two notches below its credit rating for senior unsecured debt securities. Credit ratings as of February 1, 2010 follow: Fitch Moody Standard & Poor Dominion Senior unsecured debt securities BBB+ Baa2 A Junior subordinated debt securities BBB Baa3 BBB Enhanced junior subordinated notes BBB Baa3 BBB Commercial paper F2 P-2 A-2 Virginia Power Mortgage bonds A A3 A Senior unsecured (including tax-exempt) debt securities A Baa1 A Junior subordinated debt securities BBB Baa2 BBB Preferred stock BBB Baa3 BBB Commercial paper F2 P-2 A-2 As of February 1, 2010, Fitch and Standard & Poor maintained a stable outlook for their respective ratings of Dominion and Virginia Power and Moody maintains a stable outlook on their ratings for Dominion and a positive outlook on their ratings for Virginia Power. A downgrade in an individual company credit rating would not necessarily restrict its ability to raise short-term and long-term financing as long as its credit rating remains investment grade, but it would likely increase the cost of borrowing. Dominion and Virginia Power work closely with Fitch, Moody and Standard & Poor with the objective of maintaining their current credit ratings. In order to maintain current ratings, the Companies may find it necessary to modify their business plans and such changes may adversely affect growth and EPS. Debt Covenants As part of borrowing funds and issuing debt (both short-term and long-term) or preferred securities, Dominion and Virginia Power must enter into enabling agreements. These agreements contain covenants that, in the event of default, could result in the acceleration of principal and interest payments; restrictions on distributions related to capital stock, including dividends, redemptions, repurchases, liquidation payments or guarantee payments; and in some cases, the termination of credit commitments unless a waiver of such requirements is agreed to by the lenders/security holders. These provisions are customary, with each agreement specifying which covenants apply. These provisions are not necessarily unique to Dominion and Virginia Power. Some of the typical covenants include: The timely payment of principal and interest; Information requirements, including submitting financial reports filed with the SEC to lenders; Performance obligations, audits/inspections, continuation of the basic nature of business, restrictions on certain matters related to merger or consolidation, and restrictions on disposition of all or substantially all assets; Compliance with collateral minimums or requirements related to mortgage bonds; and Limitations on liens. Dominion and Virginia Power are required to pay annual commitment fees to maintain their credit facilities. In addition, their credit agreements contain various terms and conditions that could affect their ability to borrow under these facilities. They include maximum debt to total capital ratios and cross-default provisions. As of December 31, 2009, the calculated total debt to total capital ratio, pursuant to the terms of the agreements, was as follows: Company Maximum Ratio Actual Ratio (1) Dominion 65 % 56 % Virginia Power 65 % 48 % (1) Indebtedness as defined by the bank agreements excludes junior subordinated notes reflected as long-term debt as well as AOCI reflected as equity in the Consolidated Balance Sheets. These provisions apply separately to Dominion and Virginia Power. If Dominion or Virginia Power or any of either company material subsidiaries fail to make payment on various debt obligations in excess of $35 million, the lenders could require that company to accelerate its repayment of any outstanding borrowings under the credit facility and the lenders could terminate their commitment to lend funds to that company. Accordingly, any default by Dominion will not affect the lenders commitment to Virginia Power. However, any default by Virginia Power would affect the lenders commitment to Dominion under the joint credit agreement. Dominion executed Replacement Capital Covenants (RCCs) in connection with its issuance of the following hybrid securities: $300 million of 2006 Series A Enhanced Junior Subordinated Notes due 2066 (June 2006 hybrids) $500 million of 2006 Series B Enhanced Junior Subordinated Notes due 2066 (September 2006 hybrids) $685 million of 2009 Series A Enhanced Junior Subordinated Notes due 2064, subject to maturity extensions to no later than 2079 (June 2009 hybrids) Under the terms of the RCCs, Dominion promises and covenants to and for the benefit of designated covered debtholders, as may be designated from time to time, that Dominion shall not redeem, repurchase, or defease all or any part of the hybrids, and shall not cause its majority owned subsidiaries to purchase all or any part of the hybrids, on or before their applicable RCC termination date, unless, subject to certain limitations, during the 180 days prior to the respective RCC termination date, Dominion has received a specified amount of proceeds as set forth in the RCCs from the sale of qualifying securities that have equity-like characteristics that are the same as, or more equity-like than the applicable characteristics of the hybrids at that time, as more fully described in the RCCs. The proceeds Dominion receives from the replacement offering, adjusted by a predetermined factor, must exceed the redemption or repurchase price. 50 Table of Contents At December 31, 2009, the termination dates and covered debt under the RCCs associated with Dominion hybrids are as follows: Hybrid RCC Termination Date Designated Covered Debt Under RCC June 2006 hybrids 6/30/2036 September 2006 hybrids September 2006 hybrids 9/30/2036 June 2006 hybrids June 2009 hybrids 6/15/2034 (1) 2008 Series B Senior Notes, 7.0% due 2038 (1) Automatically extended, as set forth in the RCC, for additional quarterly periods, to the extent the maturity date is extended. Dominion and Virginia Power monitor the debt covenants on a regular basis in order to ensure that events of default will not occur. As of December 31, 2009, there have been no events of default under or changes to Dominion debt covenants. Dividend Restrictions The Virginia Commission may prohibit any public service company, including Virginia Power, from declaring or paying a dividend to an affiliate if found to be detrimental to the public interest. At December 31, 2009, the Virginia Commission had not restricted the payment of dividends by Virginia Power. Certain agreements associated with Dominion and Virginia Power credit facilities contain restrictions on the ratio of debt to total capitalization. These limitations did not restrict Dominion or Virginia Power ability to pay dividends or receive dividends from their subsidiaries at December 31, 2009. See Note 18 to the Consolidated Financial Statements for a description of potential restrictions on dividend payments by Dominion in connection with the deferral of interest payments on junior subordinated notes. Future Cash Payments for Contractual Obligations and Planned Capital Expenditures C ONTRACTUAL O BLIGATIONS Dominion and Virginia Power are party to numerous contracts and arrangements obligating them to make cash payments in future years. These contracts include financing arrangements such as debt agreements and leases, as well as contracts for the purchase of goods and services and financial derivatives. Presented below is a table summarizing cash payments that may result from contracts to which Dominion and Virginia Power are parties as of December 31, 2009. For purchase obligations and other liabilities, amounts are based upon contract terms, including fixed and minimum quantities to be purchased at fixed or market-based prices. Actual cash payments will be based upon actual quantities purchased and prices paid and will likely differ from amounts presented below. The table excludes all amounts classified as current liabilities in the Consolidated Balance Sheets, other than current maturities of long-term debt, interest payable and certain derivative instruments. The majority of Dominion and Virginia Power current liabilities will be paid in cash in 2010.

(6) Excludes regulatory liabilities, AROs and employee benefit plan obligations, which are not contractually fixed as to timing and amount. See Notes 13, 15 and 22 to the Consolidated Financial Statements. Due to uncertainty about the timing and amounts that will ultimately be paid, $186 million of income taxes payable associated with unrecognized tax benefits are excluded. Deferred income taxes are also excluded since cash payments are based primarily on taxable income for each discrete fiscal year. See Note 6 to the Consolidated Financial Statements.

P LANNED C APITAL E XPENDITURES Dominion planned capital expenditures are expected to total approximately $3.9 billion, $3.8 billion and $4.2 billion in 2010, 2011 and 2012, respectively. Dominion expenditures are expected to include construction and expansion of electric generation and natural gas transmission and storage facilities, environmental upgrades, construction improvements and expansion of electric transmission and distribution assets, purchases of nuclear fuel and expenditures to explore for and develop natural gas and oil properties. Virginia Power planned capital expenditures are expected to total approximately $2.5 billion, $2.2 billion and $2.4 billion in 2010, 2011 and 2012, respectively. Virginia Power expenditures are expected to include construction and expansion of electric generation facilities, environmental upgrades and construction improvements and expansion of electric transmission and distribution assets. Dominion and Virginia Power expect to fund their capital expenditures with cash from operations and a combination of securities issuances and short-term borrowings. Planned capital expenditures include capital projects that are subject to approval by regulators and the Board of Directors. Based on available generation capacity and current estimates of growth in customer demand, Virginia Power will need additional generation in the future. See Dominion Generation-Properties in Item 1. Business for a discussion of Virginia Power expansion plans. These estimates are subject to continuing review and adjustment and actual capital expenditures may vary from these estimates. The Companies may also choose to postpone or cancel certain planned capital expenditures in order to mitigate the need for future debt financings and equity issuances. Use of Off-Balance Sheet Arrangements G UARANTEES Dominion primarily enters into guarantee arrangements on behalf of its consolidated subsidiaries. These arrangements are not subject to the provisions of FASB guidance that dictate a guarantor accounting and disclosure requirements for guarantees, including indirect guarantees of indebtedness of others . At December 31, 2009, Dominion had issued $261 million of guarantees to support third parties and equity method investees, primarily reflecting guarantees issued to support the NedPower and Fowler Ridge wind farm joint ventures. See Note 23 to the Consolidated Financial Statements for further discussion of these guarantees. L EASING A RRANGEMENT Dominion leases Fairless in Pennsylvania, which began commercial operations in June 2004. During construction, Dominion acted as the construction agent for the lessor, controlled the design and construction of the facility and has since been reimbursed for all project costs ($898 million) advanced to the lessor. Dominion makes annual lease payments of $53 million. The lease expires in 2013 and at that time, Dominion may renew the lease at negotiated amounts based on original project costs and current market conditions, subject to lessor approval; purchase Fairless at its original construction cost; or sell Fairless, on behalf of the lessor, to an independent third party. If Fairless is sold and the proceeds from the sale are less than its original construction cost, Dominion would be required to make a payment to the lessor in an amount up to 70.75% of original project costs adjusted for certain other costs as specified in the lease. The lease agreement does not contain any provisions that involve credit rating or stock price trigger events. Benefits of this arrangement include: Certain tax benefits as Dominion is considered the owner of the leased property for tax purposes. As a result, Dominion is entitled to tax deductions for depreciation not recognized for financial accounting purposes; and As an operating lease for financial accounting purposes, the asset and related borrowings used to finance the construction of the asset are not included in the Consolidated Balance Sheets. Although this improves measures of leverage calculated using amounts reported in the Consolidated Financial Statements, credit rating agencies view lease obligations as debt equivalents in evaluating Dominion credit profile. F UTURE I SSUES AND O THER M ATTERS See Item 1. Business, Item 3. Legal Proceedings, and Notes 14 and 23 to the Consolidated Financial Statements for additional information on various environmental, regulatory, legal and other matters that may impact future results of operations and/or financial condition. Environmental Matters Dominion and Virginia Power are subject to costs resulting from a number of federal, state and local laws and regulations designed to protect human health and the environment. These laws and regulations affect future planning and existing operations. They 52 Table of Contents can result in increased capital, operating and other costs as a result of compliance, remediation, containment and monitoring obligations. E NVIRONMENTAL P ROTECTION AND M ONITORING E XPENDITURES Dominion incurred approximately $252 million, $205 million, and $181 million of expenses (including depreciation) during 2009, 2008, and 2007 respectively, in connection with environmental protection and monitoring activities and expects these expenses to be approximately $268 million and $274 million in 2010 and 2011, respectively. In addition, capital expenditures related to environmental controls were $266 million, $254 million, and $293 million for 2009, 2008, and 2007, respectively. These expenditures are expected to be approximately $383 million and $322 million for 2010 and 2011, respectively. Virginia Power incurred approximately $134 million, $125 million, and $121 million of expenses (including depreciation) during 2009, 2008, and 2007, respectively, in connection with environmental protection and monitoring activities and expects these expenses to be approximately $153 million and $150 million in 2010 and 2011, respectively. In addition, capital expenditures related to environmental controls were $109 million, $116 million, and $189 million for 2009, 2008 and 2007, respectively. These expenditures are expected to be approximately $102 million and $54 million for 2010 and 2011, respectively. F UTURE E NVIRONMENTAL R EGULATIONS There has already been federal legislative proposals and regulatory action regarding the regulation of GHG emissions. Dominion and Virginia Power expect that there may be federal legislation or regulatory action regarding compliance with more stringent air emission standards, regarding coal combustion byproducts, and regarding regulation of cooling water intake structures and discharges in the future. With respect to GHG emissions, the outcome in terms of specific requirements and timing is uncertain but may include a GHG emissions cap-and-trade program or a carbon tax for electric generators and natural gas businesses or regulation of GHGs under the CAA. With respect to emission reductions, specific requirements will depend on how the EPA and/or states replace CAMR and the outcome of the EPA response to the CAIR remand. With respect to cooling water intakes and discharges, the Companies expect future federal regulation on cooling water intake structures and more focus by EPA and state regulatory authorities on thermal discharge issues. With respect to coal combustion byproducts, Dominion and Virginia Power expect federal regulation of coal combustion byproduct handling and disposal practices. If any of these new proposals are adopted, additional significant expenditures may be required.
