Item 7. Management Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations. The following Management Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations ( MD&A ) is provided as a supplement to, and should be read in conjunction with, our audited consolidated financial statements and the accompanying notes presented in Item 8. Consolidated Financial Statements and Supplementary Data. Note references are to the notes to consolidated financial statements included in Item 8. Certain prior year amounts have been reclassified to conform to the current year presentation. All references to net earnings per share are to diluted net earnings per share. Amounts and percentages may not total due to rounding. OVERVIEW See Part I, Item 1 for a detailed description and discussion of the company business. CarMax is the nation largest retailer of used vehicles. We operate in two reportable segments: CarMax Sales Operations and CarMax Auto Finance ( CAF ). Our CarMax Sales Operations segment consists of all aspects of our auto merchandising and service operations, excluding financing provided by CAF. Our CAF segment consists solely of our own finance operation that provides financing to customers buying vehicles from CarMax. CarMax Sales Operations Our sales operations segment consists of retail sales of used vehicles and related products and services, such as wholesale vehicle sales; the sale of extended protection plan ( EPP ) products, which include extended service plans ( ESPs ) and guaranteed asset protection ( GAP ); and vehicle repair service. GAP is designed to cover the unpaid balance on an auto loan in the event of a total loss of the vehicle or unrecovered theft. We focus on addressing the major sources of customer dissatisfaction with traditional auto retailers while maximizing operating efficiencies. We offer low, no-haggle prices; a broad selection of CarMax Quality Certified used vehicles; value-added EPP products; and superior customer service. Our customers finance the majority of the retail vehicles purchased from us, and availability of on-the-spot financing is a critical component of the sales process. We provide financing to qualified retail customers through CAF and our arrangements with industry-leading third-party finance providers. All of the finance offers, whether by CAF or our third-party providers, are backed by a 3-day payoff option. As of February 29, 2016 , we operated 158 used car stores in 78 markets, covering 50 mid-sized markets, 22 large markets and 6 small markets. We define mid-sized markets as those with television viewing populations generally between 600,000 and 3 million people. As of that date, we also conducted wholesale auctions at 67 used car stores and we operated 2 new car franchises. CarMax Auto Finance In addition to third-party financing providers, we provide vehicle financing through CAF, which offers financing solely to customers buying retail vehicles from CarMax. CAF allows us to manage our reliance on third-party financing providers and to leverage knowledge of our business to provide qualifying customers a competitive financing option. As a result, we believe CAF enables us to capture additional profits, cash flows and sales. After the effect of 3-day payoffs and vehicle returns, CAF financed 42.8% of our retail used vehicle unit sales in fiscal 2016 . As of February 29, 2016 , CAF serviced approximately 709,000 customer accounts in its $9.59 billion portfolio of managed receivables. Management regularly analyzes CAF operating results by assessing the competitiveness of our consumer offer, profitability, the performance of the auto loan receivables including trends in credit losses and delinquencies, and CAF direct expenses. Revenues and Profitability During fiscal 2016 , net sales and operating revenues increased 6.2% , net earnings grew 4.4% and net earnings per share increased 11.0%. Fiscal 2015 results were impacted by a benefit of $12.9 million, net of tax, or $0.06 per share, related to the receipt of settlement proceeds in a class action lawsuit. Our primary source of revenue and net income is the retail sale of used vehicles. During fiscal 2016 , we sold 619,936 used cars, representing 82.1% of our net sales and operating revenues and 66.3% of our gross profit. Used vehicle unit sales grew 6.5% , including a 2.4% increase in comparable store used units and sales from newer stores not yet included in the comparable store base. Used vehicle gross profits increased 5.5% due to the increase in unit sales, partially offset by a modest reduction in used vehicle gross profit per unit. Wholesale sales are also a significant contributor to our revenues and net income. During fiscal 2016 , we sold 394,437 wholesale vehicles, representing 14.4% of our net sales and operating revenues and 19.2% of our gross profit. Wholesale vehicle unit sales 22 grew 4.9% , primarily reflecting the growth in our store base. Wholesale vehicle gross profits increased 6.4% due to the combination of the increase in unit sales and a modest increase in wholesale vehicle gross profit per unit. During fiscal 2016 , other sales and revenues, which include revenue earned on the sale of EPP products, net third-party finance fees, and new car and service department sales, represented 3.4% of our net sales and operating revenues and 14.5% of our gross profit. Other sales and revenues declined 4.2% , primarily due to our disposal of two of the four new car franchises we owned at the start of fiscal 2016. Other gross profit increased 14.9% , reflecting the combination of improved EPP revenues and net third-party finance fees, as well as the benefit related to the change in timing of our recognition of reconditioning overhead costs. These costs, which previously had been expensed as incurred, are now allocated to the carrying cost of inventory. Income from our CAF segment totaled $392.0 million in fiscal 2016 , up 6.7% compared with fiscal 2015 . CAF income primarily reflects the interest and fee income generated by the auto loan receivables less the interest expense associated with the debt issued to fund these receivables, a provision for estimated loan losses and direct CAF expenses. CAF income does not include any allocation of indirect costs. Liquidity Our primary ongoing sources of liquidity include funds provided by operations, proceeds from securitization transactions, and borrowings under our revolving credit facility or through other financing sources. During fiscal 2016 , liquidity was primarily provided by $908.2 million of adjusted net cash provided by operating activities (a non-GAAP measure), which included $1.06 billion in net issuances of non-recourse notes payable, and by net borrowings of $404.6 million under our revolving credit facility. This liquidity was primarily used to fund the 16.3 million common shares repurchased under our share repurchase program, our store growth and the increase in CAF auto loan receivables. When considering cash provided by operating activities, management does not include increases in auto loan receivables that have been securitized with non-recourse notes payable, which are separately reflected as cash provided by financing activities. For a reconciliation of adjusted net cash provided by operating activities to net cash used in operating activities, the most directly comparable GAAP financial measure, see Reconciliation of Adjusted Net Cash from Operating Activities included in FINANCIAL CONDITION Liquidity and Capital Resources. Future Outlook Over the long term, we believe the primary driver for earnings growth will be vehicle unit sales growth from both new stores and stores included in our comparable store base. We also believe that increased used vehicle unit sales will drive increased sales of wholesale vehicles and ancillary products and, over time, increased CAF income. To expand our vehicle unit sales at new and existing stores, we will need to continue delivering an unrivaled customer experience and hiring and developing the associates necessary to drive our success, while managing the risks posed by an evolving competitive environment. In addition, to support our store growth plans, we will need to continue procuring suitable real estate at favorable terms. We are still in the midst of the national rollout of our retail concept, and as of February 29, 2016 , we had used car stores located in markets that represented approximately 65% of the U.S. population. During fiscal 2016 , we opened 14 stores and relocated 1 store whose lease was set to expire. In fiscal 2017 , we plan to open 15 stores. In fiscal 2018, we plan to open between 13 and 16 stores. For a detailed list of stores we plan to open in fiscal 2017, see the table included in Planned Future Activities. For additional information about risks and uncertainties facing our Company, see Risk Factors, included in Part I, Item 1A of this Form 10-K. CRITICAL ACCOUNTING POLICIES Our results of operations and financial condition as reflected in the consolidated financial statements have been prepared in accordance with U.S. generally accepted accounting principles. Preparation of financial statements requires management to make estimates and assumptions affecting the reported amounts of assets, liabilities, revenues, expenses and the disclosures of contingent assets and liabilities. We use our historical experience and other relevant factors when developing our estimates and assumptions. We regularly evaluate these estimates and assumptions. Note 2 includes a discussion of significant accounting policies. The accounting policies discussed below are the ones we consider critical to an understanding of our consolidated financial statements because their application places the most significant demands on our judgment. Our financial results might have been different if different assumptions had been used or other conditions had prevailed. Financing and Securitization Transactions We maintain a revolving securitization program composed of two warehouse facilities ( warehouse facilities ) that we use to fund auto loan receivables originated by CAF until we elect to fund them through a term securitization or alternative funding 23 arrangement. We recognize transfers of auto loan receivables into the warehouse facilities and term securitizations as secured borrowings, which result in recording the auto loan receivables and the related non-recourse notes payable on our consolidated balance sheets. CAF income included in the consolidated statements of earnings primarily reflects the interest and fee income generated by the auto loan receivables less the interest expense associated with the debt issued to fund these receivables, a provision for estimated loan losses and direct CAF expenses. Auto loan receivables include amounts due from customers related to retail vehicle sales financed through CAF. The receivables are presented net of an allowance for estimated loan losses. The allowance for loan losses represents an estimate of the amount of net losses inherent in our portfolio of managed receivables as of the applicable reporting date and anticipated to occur during the following 12 months. The allowance is primarily based on the credit quality of the underlying receivables, historical loss trends and forecasted forward loss curves. We also take into account recent trends in delinquencies and losses, recovery rates and the economic environment. The provision for loan losses is the periodic expense of maintaining an adequate allowance. See Notes 2(F), 2(I) and 4 for additional information on securitizations and auto loan receivables. Revenue Recognition We recognize revenue when the earnings process is complete, generally either at the time of sale to a customer or upon delivery to a customer. As part of our customer service strategy, we guarantee the retail vehicles we sell with a 5 day, money-back guarantee. We record a reserve for estimated returns based on historical experience and trends, and results could be affected if future vehicle returns differ from historical averages. We also sell ESPs and GAP on behalf of unrelated third parties, who are the primary obligors, to customers who purchase a vehicle. The ESPs we currently offer on all used vehicles provide coverage up to 60 months (subject to mileage limitations), while GAP covers the customer for the term of their finance contract. We recognize revenue at the time of sale, net of a reserve for estimated contract cancellations. Periodically, we may receive additional revenue based upon the level of underwriting profits of the third parties who administer the products. These additional amounts are recognized as revenue when received. The reserve for cancellations is evaluated for each product and is based on forecasted forward cancellation curves utilizing historical experience, recent trends and credit mix of the customer base. Our risk related to contract cancellations is limited to the revenue that we receive. Cancellations fluctuate depending on the volume of ESP and GAP sales, customer financing default or prepayment rates, and shifts in customer behavior related to changes in the coverage or term of the product. Results could be affected if actual events differ from our estimates. A 10% change in the estimated cancellation rates would have changed cancellation reserves by approximately $11.0 million as of February 29, 2016 . See Note 8 for additional information on cancellation reserves. Customers applying for financing who are not approved by CAF may be evaluated by other third-party finance providers. These providers generally either pay us or are paid a fixed, pre-negotiated fee per contract. We recognize these fees at the time of sale. We collect sales taxes and other taxes from customers on behalf of governmental authorities at the time of sale. These taxes are accounted for on a net basis and are not included in net sales and operating revenues or cost of sales. Income Taxes Estimates and judgments are used in the calculation of certain tax liabilities and in the determination of the recoverability of certain deferred tax assets. In the ordinary course of business, transactions occur for which the ultimate tax outcome is uncertain at the time of the transactions. We adjust our income tax provision in the period in which we determine that it is probable that our actual results will differ from our estimates. Tax law and rate changes are reflected in the income tax provision in the period in which such changes are enacted. See Note 9 for additional information on income taxes. We evaluate the need to record valuation allowances that would reduce deferred tax assets to the amount that will more likely than not be realized. When assessing the need for valuation allowances, we consider available loss carrybacks, tax planning strategies, future reversals of existing temporary differences and future taxable income. Except for a valuation allowance recorded for capital loss carryforwards that may not be utilized before their expiration, we believe that our recorded deferred tax assets as of February 29, 2016 , will more likely than not be realized. However, if a change in circumstances results in a change in our ability to realize our deferred tax assets, our tax provision would be affected in the period when the change in circumstances occurs. In addition, the calculation of our tax liabilities involves dealing with uncertainties in the application of complex tax regulations. We recognize potential liabilities for anticipated tax audit issues in the U.S. federal and other tax jurisdictions based on our estimate of whether, and the extent to which, additional taxes will be due. If payments of these amounts ultimately prove to be unnecessary, the reversal of the liabilities would result in tax benefits being recognized in the period when we determine the liabilities are no longer necessary. If our estimate of tax liabilities proves to be less than the ultimate assessment, a further charge to expense would result in the period of determination. 24 RESULTS OF OPERATIONS CARMAX SALES OPERATIONS N ET S ALES AND O PERATING R EVENUES Years Ended February 29 or 28 (In millions) 2016 Change 2015 Change 2014 Used vehicle sales $ 12,439.4 6.6 % $ 11,674.5 13.3 % $ 10,306.3 Wholesale vehicle sales 2,188.3 6.8 % 2,049.1 12.4 % 1,823.4 Other sales and revenues: Extended protection plan revenues 267.8 4.7 % 255.7 22.4 % 208.9 Third-party finance fees, net (61.5 ) 3.5 % (63.7 ) 23.0 % (82.8 ) Other (1) 315.7 (10.6 )% 353.1 10.9 % 318.5 Total other sales and revenues 522.0 (4.2 )% 545.1 22.6 % 444.6 Total net sales and operating revenues $ 15,149.7 6.2 % $ 14,268.7 13.5 % $ 12,574.3 (1) In fiscal 2016, we reclassified New Vehicle Sales to Other Sales and Revenues and no longer separately present New Vehicle Sales.

Used Vehicle Sales Fiscal 2016 Versus Fiscal 2015 . The 6.6% increase in used vehicle revenues in fiscal 2016 resulted from a 6.5% increase in unit sales. The increase in used unit sales included a 2.4% increase in comparable store used unit sales and sales from newer stores not yet included in the comparable store base. The comparable store used unit sales performance was driven by improved conversion, partially offset by a decrease in store traffic. We believe that various market factors, including, but not limited to, the availability and relative valuations of certain used vehicle inventories, and new vehicle lease and price promotions, may have contributed to the decrease in store traffic. Our data indicates that in our markets, we increased our share of the 0- to 10-year old used vehicle market by approximately 1% in calendar 2015. Fiscal 2015 Versus Fiscal 2014 . The 13.3% increase in used vehicle revenues in fiscal 2015 resulted from a 10.5% increase in used unit sales and a 2.5% increase in average retail vehicle selling price. The increase in used unit sales included a 4.4% increase in comparable store used unit sales and sales from newer stores not yet included in the comparable store base. The comparable store used unit growth reflected improved customer traffic, as well as improved conversion. Our data indicates that in our markets, we increased our share of the 0- to 10-year old used vehicle market by approximately 5% in calendar 2014. The increase in average retail vehicle selling price primarily reflected changes in our sales mix, with an increased mix of 0- to 4-year old vehicles in fiscal 2015. From 2008 through 2012, new car industry sales were at rates significantly below pre-recession levels, which affected the overall supply and acquisition costs of late-model used vehicles. As the supply of later-model used vehicles has gradually improved, our inventory mix has shifted accordingly. Wholesale Vehicle Sales Our wholesale auction prices usually reflect the trends in the general wholesale market for the types of vehicles we sell, although they can also be affected by changes in vehicle mix or the average age, mileage or condition of the vehicles bought through our appraisal process and sold in our auctions. Fiscal 2016 Versus Fiscal 2015 . The 6.8% increase in wholesale vehicle revenues in fiscal 2016 resulted from a 4.9% increase in wholesale unit sales and a 1.0% increase in average wholesale vehicle selling price. The wholesale unit growth primarily reflected the growth in our store base. Fiscal 2015 Versus Fiscal 2014 . The 12.4% increase in wholesale vehicle revenues in fiscal 2015 resulted from a 9.8% increase in wholesale unit sales and a 2.2% increase in average wholesale vehicle selling price. The wholesale unit growth reflected both an increase in the appraisal buy rate and the growth in our store base. 26 Other Sales and Revenues Other sales and revenues include revenue from the sale of ESPs and GAP (collectively reported in EPP revenues, net of a reserve for estimated contract cancellations), net third-party finance fees and other revenues. Starting in fiscal 2016, new car sales are also included as a component of other revenues, along with service department sales. We refer to the third-party finance providers who generally pay us a fee or to whom no fee is paid as Tier 2 providers, and we refer to the providers to whom we pay a fee as Tier 3 providers. The fees we pay to the Tier 3 providers are reflected as an offset to finance fee revenues received from the Tier 2 providers. The mix of our retail vehicles financed by CAF, Tier 2 and Tier 3 providers may vary from quarter to quarter depending on several factors including the credit quality of applicants, changes in providers credit decisioning and external market conditions. Changes in originations by one tier of credit providers may also affect the originations made by providers in other tiers. Fiscal 2016 Versus Fiscal 2015 . Other sales and revenues declined 4.2% in fiscal 2016, primarily due to our disposal of two of the four new car franchises we owned at the start of fiscal 2016. EPP revenue increased 4.7% largely reflecting the growth in our used unit sales. Net third-party finance fees improved by 3.5% primarily due to shifts in the mix among finance providers. Vehicles financed by the Tier 3 providers and vehicles included in the CAF Tier 3 loan origination program represented 14.4% of retail used unit sales in fiscal 2016 versus 15.8% in fiscal 2015. Fiscal 2015 Versus Fiscal 2014 . Other sales and revenues increased 22.6% primarily due to the 10.5% increase in used units sold. The 22.4% increase in EPP revenues was due to the increase in used unit sales as well as prior year EPP cancellation reserve correction that reduced fiscal 2014 EPP revenues. Net third-party finance fees improved 23.0% primarily due to a mix shift among providers, including an increase in the percentage of our used unit sales financed by the Tier 2 providers and a reduction in the percentage financed by the Tier 3 providers. The percentage of retail used vehicles financed by Tier 3 providers, combined with those financed under the CAF Tier 3 loan origination program, was 15.8% in fiscal 2015 compared with 19.1% in fiscal 2014. Other revenue increases were primarily the result of increases in new vehicle revenues due to increases in unit sales. During fiscal 2014, we corrected our accounting related to cancellation reserves for ESP and GAP, with resulting increases in reserves related to activity for fiscal 2014, fiscal 2013 and fiscal 2012. The portion of the correction recorded in fiscal 2014 that related to earlier fiscal years was $19.5 million, or $0.05 per share. G ROSS P ROFIT Years Ended February 29 or 28 (In millions) 2016 Change 2015 Change 2014 Used vehicle gross profit $ 1,338.6 5.5 % $ 1,268.5 10.9 % $ 1,143.9 Wholesale vehicle gross profit 388.1 6.4 % 364.9 16.3 % 313.9 Other gross profit 292.1 14.9 % 254.1 33.1 % 190.9 Total $ 2,018.8 7.0 % $ 1,887.5 14.5 % $ 1,648.7 G ROSS P ROFIT P ER U NIT Years Ended February 29 or 28 2016 2015 2014 $ per unit (1) % (2) $ per unit (1) % (2) $ per unit (1) % (2) Used vehicle gross profit $ 2,159 10.8 $ 2,179 10.9 $ 2,171 11.1 Wholesale vehicle gross profit $ 984 17.7 $ 970 17.8 $ 916 17.2 Other gross profit $ 471 55.9 $ 436 46.6 $ 362 42.9 Total gross profit $ 3,256 13.3 $ 3,242 13.2 $ 3,129 13.1 (1) Calculated as category gross profit divided by its respective units sold, except the other and total categories, which are divided by total used units sold. (2) Calculated as a percentage of its respective sales or revenue. Used Vehicle Gross Profit We target a dollar range of gross profit per used unit sold. The gross profit dollar target for an individual vehicle is based on a variety of factors, including its probability of sale and its mileage relative to its age; however, it is not primarily based on the vehicle selling price. Our ability to quickly adjust appraisal offers to be consistent with the broader market trade-in trends and 27 the pace of our inventory turns reduce our exposure to the inherent continual fluctuation in used vehicle values and contribute to our ability to manage gross profit dollars per unit. We systematically mark down individual vehicle prices based on proprietary pricing algorithms in order to appropriately balance sales trends, inventory turns and gross profit achievement. Other factors that may influence gross profit include changes in our vehicle reconditioning costs, changes in the percentage of vehicles sourced directly from consumers through our appraisal process and changes in the wholesale pricing environment. Vehicles purchased directly from consumers typically generate more gross profit per unit compared with vehicles purchased at auction or through other channels. Fiscal 2016 Versus Fiscal 2015 . The 5.5% increase in used vehicle gross profit in fiscal 2016 was primarily driven by the 6.5% growth in total used unit sales, partially offset by a modest decline in used gross profit per unit. Fiscal 2015 Versus Fiscal 2014 . The 10.9% increase in used vehicle gross profit in fiscal 2015 was driven by the corresponding increase in used unit sales. Used vehicle gross profit per unit remained consistent. Wholesale Vehicle Gross Profit Our wholesale gross profit per unit reflects the demand for older, higher mileage vehicles, which are the mainstay of our auctions, as well as the continued strong dealer attendance and resulting high dealer-to-car ratios at our auctions. The frequency of our auctions, which are generally held weekly or bi-weekly, minimizes the depreciation risk on these vehicles. Our ability to adjust appraisal offers in response to the wholesale pricing environment is a key factor that influences wholesale gross profit. Fiscal 2016 Versus Fiscal 2015 . The 6.4% increase in wholesale vehicle gross profit in fiscal 2016 reflected the combination of the 4.9% increase in wholesale unit sales with a $14 increase in wholesale gross profit per unit. Fiscal 2015 Versus Fiscal 2014 . The 16.3% increase in wholesale vehicle gross profit in fiscal 2015 reflected the combination of the 9.8% increase in wholesale unit sales with a $54 increase in wholesale gross profit per unit. Other Gross Profit Other gross profit includes profits related to EPP revenues, net third-party finance fees and other revenues, which are comprised of new car sales and service department operations, including used vehicle reconditioning. We have no cost of sales related to EPP revenues or net third-party finance fees, as these represent revenues paid to us by certain third-party providers. Third-party finance fees are reported net of the fees we pay to third-party Tier 3 finance providers. Accordingly, changes in the relative mix of the other gross profit components can affect the composition and amount of other gross profit. Fiscal 2016 Versus Fiscal 2015 . Other gross profit rose 14.9% in fiscal 2016 , primarily reflecting the improvement in EPP revenues and net third-party finance fees discussed above, as well as an increase in service department gross profits due to a change in the timing of our recognition of reconditioning overhead costs, which increased other gross profit in fiscal 2016 by $10.4 million. These costs, which previously had been expensed as incurred, are now allocated to the carrying cost of inventory. Fiscal 2015 Versus Fiscal 2014 . Other gross profit increased 33.1% primarily due to the EPP cancellation reserve correction that reduced fiscal 2014 gross profit. Excluding this correction, gross profit increased consistent with the changes in other sales and revenues discussed above. Impact of Inflation Historically, inflation has not had a significant impact on results. Profitability is primarily affected by our ability to achieve targeted unit sales and gross profit dollars per vehicle rather than by changes in average retail prices. However, changes in average vehicle selling prices impact CAF income, to the extent the average amount financed also changes. In the years following the recession, we experienced a period of appreciation in used vehicle wholesale pricing. We believe the appreciation resulted, in part, from a reduced supply of late-model used vehicles in the market. This reduced supply was caused by the dramatic decline in new car industry sales and the associated slow down in used vehicle trade-in activity, compared with pre-recession periods. The higher wholesale values increased both our vehicle acquisition costs and our used vehicle average selling prices, which climbed from $16,291 in fiscal 2009 to $19,917 in fiscal 2016. 28 Selling, General and Administrative ( SG&A ) Expenses C OMPONENTS OF SG&A E XPENSES Years Ended February 29 or 28 (In millions except per unit data) 2016 Change 2015 Change 2014 Compensation and benefits (1) $ 737.6 1.0 % $ 730.4 11.2 % $ 656.7 Store occupancy costs 275.6 13.2 % 243.5 12.3 % 216.8 Advertising expense 140.6 14.5 % 122.8 9.4 % 112.2 Other overhead costs (2) 198.1 23.0 % 161.0 (5.0 )% 169.5 Total SG&A expenses $ 1,351.9 7.5 % $ 1,257.7 8.9 % $ 1,155.2 SG&A per used vehicle unit (3) $ 2,181 $ 21 $ 2,160 $ (32 ) $ 2,192 (1) Excludes compensation and benefits related to reconditioning and vehicle repair service, which are included in cost of sales. (2) Includes IT expenses, insurance, non-CAF bad debt, travel, preopening and relocation costs, charitable contributions and other administrative expenses. Costs for fiscal 2015 were reduced by $20.9 million in connection with the receipt of settlement proceeds in a class action lawsuit. (3) Calculated as total SG&A expenses divided by total used vehicle units. Fiscal 2016 Versus Fiscal 2015 . SG&A expenses for fiscal 2015 were reduced by $20.9 million, or $0.06 per share, which represented our receipt of settlement proceeds in a class action lawsuit related to the economic loss associated with certain Toyota vehicles. Excluding this litigation settlement, the fiscal 2016 increase reflected the 10% growth in our store base (representing the addition of 14 stores) and higher information technology and marketing costs. This was partially offset by a $23.3 million decrease in share-based compensation expense, which was influenced by decreases in the per share price of our common stock during fiscal 2016. The decrease in share-based compensation expense in fiscal 2016 reduced SG&A per used unit by $38. Fiscal 2015 Versus Fiscal 2014 . Excluding the litigation settlement received in fiscal 2015, SG&A expenses grew, reflecting the combination of several factors, including the 10% increase in our store base during fiscal 2015 (representing the addition of 13 stores), higher variable selling costs resulting from the 4.4% increase in comparable store used unit sales, and an $11.5 million increase in share-based compensation expense, which was influenced by the $18.68 increase in the per share price of our common stock during fiscal 2015. Excluding the settlement gain, SG&A per used unit in fiscal 2015 was similar to fiscal 2014. Interest Expense Fiscal 2016 Versus Fiscal 2015 . Interest expense increased to $36.4 million in fiscal 2016 versus $24.5 million in fiscal 2015, primarily reflecting our higher average outstanding borrowings. During fiscal 2016, as a result of borrowings to fund our stock repurchase activity, we moved closer to our target range for adjusted debt to capital ratio. See Liquidity and Capital Resources for more information. Fiscal 2015 Versus Fiscal 2014 . Interest expense declined to $24.5 million in fiscal 2015 versus $30.8 million in fiscal 2014. During fiscal 2015, we capitalized $8.9 million in interest costs associated with the construction of certain facilities. Excluding the capitalized interest costs, the year-over-year increase in interest expense primarily reflected interest expense on a $300 million term loan entered into in November 2014. Other Expense Fiscal 2016 Versus Fiscal 2015 . During fiscal 2016, we recorded a one-time charge of $8.3 million associated with a property that is no longer planned to be used. Income Taxes The effective income tax rate was 38.3% in fiscal 2016 , 38.4% in fiscal 2015 and 38.2% in fiscal 2014 . 29 RESULTS OF OPERATIONS CARMAX AUTO FINANCE CAF income primarily reflects interest and fee income generated by CAF portfolio of auto loan receivables less the interest expense associated with the debt issued to fund these receivables, a provision for estimated loan losses and direct CAF expenses. CAF income does not include any allocation of indirect costs. Although CAF benefits from certain indirect overhead expenditures, we have not allocated indirect costs to CAF to avoid making subjective allocation decisions. Examples of indirect costs not allocated to CAF include retail store expenses and corporate expenses. CAF managed portfolio is composed primarily of loans originated over the past several years. Trends in receivable growth and interest margins primarily reflect the cumulative effect of changes in the business over a multi-year period. Trends in portfolio losses and delinquencies are affected by changes in our origination strategies over time, as well as current economic conditions. Current period originations reflect current trends in both our retail sales and the CAF business, including the volume of loans originated, current interest rates charged to consumers, loan terms and average credit scores. Because we recognize CAF income over the life of the underlying auto loan, loans originated in a given fiscal period generally do not have a significant effect on that period financial results. See Note 3 for additional information on CAF income and Note 4 for information on auto loan receivables, including credit quality.

(2) The average recovery rate represents the average percentage of the outstanding principal balance we receive when a vehicle is repossessed and liquidated, generally at our wholesale auctions. The annual recovery rate has ranged from a low of 42% to a high of 60%, and it is primarily affected by changes in the wholesale market pricing environment. Fiscal 2016 Versus Fiscal 2015 . CAF income rose 6.7% to $392.0 million in fiscal 2016, driven by the growth in average managed receivables, partially offset by a lower total interest margin percentage and an increase in the provision for loan losses. Average managed receivables grew 15.7% to $9.09 billion in fiscal 2016, driven by the rise in net loan originations in recent years. Net loans originated in fiscal 2016 increased 9.4% , primarily reflecting the 6.6% growth in used vehicle revenues and a higher CAF penetration rate. The increase in CAF penetration rate in fiscal 2016 was largely due to changes in the underlying credit mix of customers applying for financing. The total interest margin, which reflects the spread between interest and fees charged to consumers and our funding costs, declined to 6.1% of average managed receivables from 6.5% in fiscal 2015. This was the result of a gradual compression of the spread between rates charged to consumers and our funding costs in recent years. Changes in the interest margin on new originations affect CAF income over time. Rising interest rates, which affect CAF funding costs, or other competitive pressures on consumer rates could result in further compression in the interest margin on new originations. The provision for loan losses rose 22.9% to $101.2 million in fiscal 2016, reflecting the 15.7% increase in average managed receivables in fiscal 2016 and the effect of favorable loss experience in fiscal 2015, which reduced the provision in that year. The allowance for loan losses as a percentage of ending managed receivables remained similar at 0.99% as of February 29, 2016 , versus 0.97% as of February 28, 2015 . Fiscal 2015 Versus Fiscal 2014 . CAF income rose 9.3% to $367.3 million in fiscal 2015, driven by the growth in average managed receivables, partially offset by a lower total interest margin percent. Average managed receivables grew 18.6% to $7.86 billion in fiscal 2015. Net loans originated in fiscal 2015 increased 13.0% , primarily reflecting the 13.3% growth in used vehicle revenues. The increase in CAF penetration rate in fiscal 2015 included the effect of the increase in loans originated in the CAF Tier 3 loan origination program. The total interest margin declined to 6.5% of average managed receivables from 6.9% in fiscal 2014. This reflected the combination of a gradual decline in the average contract rate charged on new loan originations in recent years with an increase in our average funding costs for more recent securitizations. The provision for loan losses rose 14.0% to $82.3 million in fiscal 2015, reflecting the 18.6% increase in average managed receivables, partially offset by the effect of favorable loss experience. The allowance for loan losses as a percent of ending managed receivables remained consistent at 0.97% as of both February 28, 2015 and February 28, 2014. Tier 3 Loan Originations. In January 2014, CAF launched a test originating loans for customers who typically would be financed by our Tier 3 finance providers. As of February 29, 2016, a total of $96.5 million receivables were outstanding related to this program. We plan to continue to originate loans in the Tier 3 space at a share similar to that during the past two years. These loans have higher loss and delinquency rates than the remainder of the CAF portfolio, as well as higher contract rates. The program is being funded separately from the remainder of CAF portfolio using existing working capital and is not included in our current securitization program. 31 PLANNED FUTURE ACTIVITIES In fiscal 2017 , we plan to open 15 stores. In fiscal 2018, we plan to open between 13 and 16 stores. We currently estimate capital expenditures will total approximately $450 million in fiscal 2017 . Compared with fiscal 2016 , the increase in planned capital spending primarily reflects the timing of land acquisitions and construction activity.

RECENT ACCOUNTING PRONOUNCEMENTS See Note 2(Y) to the consolidated financial statements for information on recent accounting pronouncements applicable to CarMax. FINANCIAL CONDITION Liquidity and Capital Resources Our primary ongoing cash requirements are to fund our existing operations, store expansion and improvement and CAF. Since fiscal 2013, we have also elected to use cash for our share repurchase program. Our primary ongoing sources of liquidity include funds provided by operations, proceeds from securitization transactions or other funding arrangements, and borrowings under our revolving credit facility or through other financing sources. We currently target an adjusted debt to capital ratio in a range of 35% to 45%. In determining this ratio, we utilize total debt, excluding non-recourse notes payable, a multiple of rent expense and total shareholders equity. We expect to use our revolving credit facility and other financing sources, together with stock repurchases, to achieve this targeted ratio; however, in any period, we may be outside this range due to seasonal, market, strategic or other factors. Operating Activities . Net cash used in operating activities of $148.9 million in fiscal 2016 includes increases in auto loan receivables of $1.20 billion . The majority of the increases in auto loan receivables are accompanied by increases in non-recourse notes payable, which are separately reflected as cash provided by financing activities. When considering cash provided by operating activities, management uses an adjusted measure of net cash from operating activities that offsets the changes in auto loan receivables with the corresponding changes in non-recourse notes payable. This is achieved by adding back the cash provided from the net issuances of non-recourse notes payable, which represents the increase in auto loan receivables that were securitized through the issuance of non-recourse notes payable during the year. The resulting financial measure, adjusted net cash from operating activities, is a non-GAAP financial measure. We believe adjusted net cash from operating activities is a meaningful metric for investors because it provides better visibility into the cash generated from operations. Including the increases in non-recourse notes payable, net cash provided by operating activities would have been as follows: 32 R ECONCILIATION OF A DJUSTED N ET C ASH FROM O PERATING A CTIVITIES Years Ended February 29 or 28 (In millions) 2016 2015 2014 Net cash used in operating activities $ (148.9 ) $ (968.1 ) $ (613.2 ) Add: Net issuances of non-recourse notes payable (1) 1,057.1 1,222.2 1,393.4 Adjusted net cash provided by operating activities $ 908.2 $ 254.1 $ 780.2 (1) Calculated using the gross issuances less payments on non-recourse notes payable as disclosed on the consolidated statements of cash flows. As of February 29, 2016 , total inventory was $1.93 billion , representing a decrease of $154.8 million , or 7.4% , compared with the balance as of the start of the fiscal year. The decrease primarily reflected the net effects of (i) a 13% decrease in used vehicles in inventory at stores included in the comparable store base in an effort to optimize inventory, (ii) the addition of inventory to support new store openings in fiscal 2016 and (iii) our disposal of two new car franchises during fiscal 2016. As of February 28, 2015 , total inventory was $2.09 billion , representing an increase of $445.5 million, or 27.1%, compared with the balance as of the start of the fiscal year. The increase reflected a combination of factors, including an intentional build in inventories in the fall and winter of 2014 to better position us for seasonal sales opportunities, the 13 new stores opened during fiscal 2015, added inventories to support our comparable store sales growth, and below-target inventories at the start of the fiscal year. Investing Activities . Net cash used in investing activities totaled $378.8 million in fiscal 2016 , $360.7 million in fiscal 2015 and $336.7 million in fiscal 2014 . Investing activities primarily consist of capital expenditures, which totaled $315.6 million in fiscal 2016 , $309.8 million in fiscal 2015 and $310.3 million in fiscal 2014 . Capital expenditures primarily include real estate acquisitions for planned future store openings, store construction costs and store remodeling expenses. We maintain a multi-year pipeline of sites to support our store growth, so portions of capital spending in one year may relate to stores that we open in subsequent fiscal years. We opened 14 stores and relocated 1 store in fiscal 2016 and we opened 13 stores in each of fiscal 2015 and 2014 . Financing Activities . Net cash provided by financing activities totaled $537.5 million in fiscal 2016 , $728.6 million in fiscal 2015 and $1.13 billion in fiscal 2014 . Included in these amounts were net increases in total non-recourse notes payable of $1.06 billion , $1.22 billion and $1.39 billion , respectively, which were used to provide the financing for the majority of the increases of $1.20 billion , $1.37 billion and $1.32 billion , respectively, in auto loan receivables (see Operating Activities). During fiscal 2016, we increased net borrowings under the revolving credit facility by $404.6 million . During fiscal 2015, we received proceeds of $300 million from a variable-rate term loan entered into in November 2014. Net cash provided by financing activities was reduced by stock repurchases of $983.9 million in fiscal 2016 , $924.3 million in fiscal 2015 and $313.4 million in fiscal 2014 . T OTAL D EBT AND C ASH AND C ASH E QUIVALENTS As of February 29 or 28 (In thousands) 2016 2015 Borrowings under revolving credit facility $ 415,428 $ 10,785 Other long-term debt 300,000 300,000 Finance and capital lease obligations 414,654 327,838 Non-recourse notes payable 9,527,750 8,470,629 Total debt $ 10,657,832 $ 9,109,252 Cash and cash equivalents $ 37,394 $ 27,606 We have a $1.20 billion unsecured revolving credit facility, which expires in August 2020 . Borrowings under this credit facility are available for working capital and general corporate purposes, and the unused portion is fully available to us. We also have a $300 million variable-rate term loan, which is due in August 2020 . The credit facility and term loan agreements contain representations and warranties, conditions and covenants. If these requirements were not met, all amounts outstanding or otherwise owed could become due and payable immediately and other limitations could be placed on our ability to use any available borrowing capacity. 33 Finance and capital lease obligations relate primarily to stores subject to sale-leaseback transactions that did not qualify for sale accounting and are, therefore, accounted for as financings. A portion of the periodic lease payments is recognized as interest expense and the remainder reduces the obligation. In the event the leases are modified or extended beyond their original lease term, the related obligation is increased based on the present value of the revised future minimum lease payments, with a corresponding increase to the assets subject to these transactions. Upon modification, the amortization of the obligation is reset, resulting in more of the lease payments being applied to interest expense in the initial years following the modification. During fiscal 2016 , finance lease obligations were increased by $103.2 million related to leases that were modified or extended beyond their original lease term, resulting in an increase of interest expense recognized in fiscal 2016 that is expected to continue in fiscal 2017 . See Note 11 for additional information on our revolving credit facility, term loan and finance and capital lease obligations. CAF auto loan receivables are primarily funded through securitization transactions. Our securitizations are structured to legally isolate the auto loan receivables, and we would not expect to be able to access the assets of our securitization vehicles, even in insolvency, receivership or conservatorship proceedings. Similarly, the investors in the non-recourse notes payable have no recourse to our assets beyond the securitized receivables, the amounts on deposit in reserve accounts and the restricted cash from collections on auto loan receivables. We do, however, continue to have the rights associated with the interest we retain in these securitization vehicles. Loans originated in the CAF Tier 3 loan origination program are currently being funded using existing working capital. The timing of principal payments on the non-recourse notes payable is based on the timing of principal collections and defaults on the securitized auto loan receivables. The current portion of non-recourse notes payable represents principal payments that are due to be distributed in the following period. As of February 29, 2016 , $8.13 billion of non-recourse notes payable was outstanding related to term securitizations. These notes payable have scheduled maturities through August 2022 , but they may mature earlier, depending on the repayment rate of the underlying auto loan receivables. During fiscal 2016 , we completed four term securitizations, funding a total of $4.36 billion of auto loan receivables. As of February 29, 2016 , $1.40 billion of non-recourse notes payable was outstanding related to our warehouse facilities. We have periodically increased our warehouse facility limit over time, as our store base, sales and CAF loan originations have grown. As of February 29, 2016 , the combined warehouse facility limit was $2.50 billion , and unused warehouse capacity totaled $1.10 billion . Of the combined warehouse facility limit, $1.00 billion will expire in August 2016 and $1.50 billion will expire in February 2017 . See Notes 2(F) and 11 for additional information on the warehouse facilities. The securitization agreements related to the warehouse facilities include various representations and warranties, covenants and performance triggers. If these requirements are not met, we could be unable to continue to securitize receivables through the warehouse facilities. In addition, warehouse facility investors could charge us a higher rate of interest and could have us replaced as servicer. Further, we could be required to deposit collections on the securitized receivables with the warehouse facility agents on a daily basis and deliver executed lockbox agreements to the warehouse facility agents. We expect that adjusted net cash provided by operations, borrowings under existing, new or expanded credit facilities and other funding arrangements will be sufficient to fund CAF, capital expenditures, repurchases of stock and working capital for the foreseeable future. We anticipate that we will be able to enter into new, or renew or expand existing, funding arrangements to meet our future funding needs. However, based on conditions in the credit markets, the cost for these arrangements could be materially higher than historical levels and the timing and capacity of these transactions could be dictated by market availability rather than our requirements. The timing and amount of stock repurchases are determined based on share price, market conditions, legal requirements and other factors. Shares repurchased are deemed authorized but unissued shares of common stock. As of February 29, 2016 , the board had authorized a total of $3.80 billion of repurchases. At that date, $1.40 billion was available for repurchase under the board outstanding authorization, which expires on December 31, 2016 . See Note 12 for more information on share repurchase activity.
