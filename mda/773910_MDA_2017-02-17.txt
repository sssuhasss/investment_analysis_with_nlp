Item 7. Management Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations The following discussion should be read together with the Consolidated Financial Statements and the Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements , which are included in this Form 10-K in Item 8, and the information set forth in Risk Factors under Item 1A. Index Page Management Overview 53 Financial Results 55 Liquidity and Capital Resources 67 Critical Accounting Estimates 75 Recent Accounting Developments 80 MANAGEMENT OVERVIEW In 2016, Anadarko optimized and further concentrated its portfolio on higher-return, oil-levered opportunities in areas where it possesses both scale and competitive advantages, namely the Delaware and DJ basins in the U.S. onshore and deepwater Gulf of Mexico. As part of this effort, the Company closed or announced divestitures of numerous non-core U.S. onshore assets primarily located in South Texas, West Texas, East Texas/Louisiana, Wyoming, Kansas, and Pennsylvania while completing the GOM Acquisition. The GOM Acquisition expanded Anadarko operated infrastructure and substantial tie-back inventory, more than doubled the Company ownership interest in the Lucius development to approximately 49%, and doubled its net production from the Gulf of Mexico to more than 160 MBOE/d, more than 80% of which is comprised of oil. The acquired assets are expected to generate substantial cash flow over the next five years at current strip prices, allowing the Company to increase investment and growth in the Delaware and DJ basins. The Company expects to end the first quarter of 2017 with 14 operated drilling rigs in the Delaware basin and 6 operated drilling rigs in the DJ basin, which compares to 7 operated drilling rigs in the Delaware basin and 1 operated drilling rig in the DJ basin at the end of the third quarter of 2016. Recent successful exploration activity with the Warrior discovery and Phobos appraisal wells, which each provide tie-back opportunities, further demonstrate the value of the Company operated infrastructure and its hub-and-spoke capabilities in the deepwater Gulf of Mexico. As with any oil and natural-gas exploration and production company, Anadarko revenues, operating results, cash flows from operations, capital spending, and future growth rates are highly influenced by commodity prices, which affect the value the Company receives from its sales of oil, natural gas, and NGLs. Supply and demand have been slow to return to a sustained equilibrium following the decline in commodity prices in 2015 and 2016, although the November 2016 OPEC decision to cut production is expected to help accelerate the drawdown of global oil inventories. Recognizing the lower commodity-price environment, Anadarko enhanced its liquidity position by retiring and/or redeeming near-term debt maturities, primarily with proceeds from debt issued in the first quarter of 2016; executing the aforementioned monetization program; reducing capital expenditures by approximately 50% (excluding WES) relative to the prior year; enhancing operational efficiencies; and improving its cost structure through a dividend decrease and workforce reduction program. Anadarko believes that the actions taken in 2016 have positioned it well with the necessary financial flexibility to fund the Company current and long-term operations. 53 Table of Contents Index to Financial Statements Significant 2016 operating and financial activities include the following: Total Company The Company oil sales volumes were flat year over year, while the Company 2016 capital budget (excluding WES) was reduced by nearly 50%. The Company overall sales-volume product mix increased to 56% liquids in 2016 compared to 53% in 2015 . The Company improved its cost structure by approximately $800 million annually after 2016 through a dividend decrease and a workforce reduction program. The Company closed approximately $4 billion of monetizations in 2016, including asset divestitures in the U.S. onshore, the sale of Anadarko interest in Springfield Pipeline LLC to WES, the sale of a portion of the Company common units in WGP to the public, and the Company conveyance of a limited-term nonparticipating royalty interest in certain of its coal and trona leases to a third party. U.S. Onshore In December 2016, the Company entered into an agreement to sell its Marcellus oil and gas assets and certain related midstream assets for approximately $1.2 billion. In January 2017, the Company entered into an agreement to sell its Eagleford oil and gas assets for approximately $2.3 billion. These transactions are expected to close in the first quarter of 2017. Total sales volumes in the DJ basin averaged 244 MBOE/d, representing a 9% or 20 MBOE/d increase from 2015. Total sales volumes in the Delaware basin averaged 45 MBOE/d, representing a 41% or 13 MBOE/d increase from 2015. Oil sales volumes in the Delaware basin increased 8 MBbls/d, representing a 50% increase from 2015. The Company increased rig activity in the Delaware and DJ basins during the year, ending 2016 with nine operated rigs in the Delaware basin and five operated rigs in the DJ basin, compared to six rigs in the Delaware basin and two in the DJ basin in the first quarter of 2016. Gulf of Mexico In December 2016, the Company acquired oil and gas assets in the Gulf of Mexico for $1.8 billion net of purchase-price adjustments, expanding its operated infrastructure and substantial tie-back inventory. Oil sales volumes averaged 65 MBbls/d, representing a 23% increase from 2015, primarily due to new wells coming online in 2016 at Caesar/Tonga and K2, first oil from Heidelberg, and an increased flow rate at Lucius. International The TEN development project (19% nonoperated participating interest) in Ghana achieved first oil in the third quarter of 2016. In 2016, the operator at the Jubilee field in Ghana announced that damage to the FPSO turret bearing had occurred. As a result, new production and offtake procedures were implemented and the partners agreed to a long-term solution to convert the FPSO to a permanently-moored facility. Interim mooring of the vessel commenced in the fourth quarter of 2016 and is expected to be completed during the first quarter of 2017. Final decisions and approvals will be sought for the long-term turret system solution in the first half of 2017. It is anticipated that a facility shutdown of up to 12 weeks may be required in the second half of 2017. The partnership is actively seeking optimization solutions to minimize the duration of any shutdown period. The Company Algeria operations achieved the highest production rates since 2009 due to the completion of the increased water-handling project at the Ourhoud facility and obtaining approval of a new reservoir development plan for the El Merk fields allowing for higher plateau rates. During the fourth quarter of 2016, the Development Plan for the initial two-train onshore LNG project in Mozambique was submitted to the Government of Mozambique. 54 Table of Contents Index to Financial Statements Financial The Company generated $3.0 billion of cash flow from operations and ended 2016 with $3.2 billion of cash. During the second quarter of 2016, the Company used proceeds from a March 2016 public offering of Senior Notes totaling $3.0 billion due 2021, 2026, and 2046 to redeem its $1.750 billion Senior Notes due 2016 and to purchase and retire $1.25 billion of its Senior Notes due 2017. In the fourth quarter of 2016, Anadarko redeemed its remaining $750 million Senior Notes due 2017. During the third quarter of 2016, the Company completed a public offering of 40.5 million shares of its common stock for net proceeds of $2.16 billion . Net proceeds were primarily used to fund the GOM Acquisition.

Production of oil, natural gas, and NGLs is usually not affected by seasonal swings in demand. 56 Table of Contents Index to Financial Statements Oil Sales Revenues, Average Prices, and Volumes 2016 Inc (Dec) vs. 2015 2015 Inc (Dec) vs. 2014 2014 Oil sales revenues (millions) $ 4,668 (14 )% $ 5,420 (44 )% $ 9,748 United States Sales volumes MMBbls 85 1 % 85 14 % 74 MBbls/d 233 1 232 14 203 Price per barrel $ 39.06 (13 ) $ 45.00 (49 ) $ 87.99 International Sales volumes MMBbls 31 (2 )% 31 (4 )% 32 MBbls/d 83 (2 ) 85 (4 ) 89 Price per barrel $ 43.93 (15 ) $ 51.68 (48 ) $ 99.79 Total Sales volumes MMBbls 116 % 116 9 % 106 MBbls/d 316 317 9 292 Price per barrel $ 40.34 (14 ) $ 46.79 (49 ) $ 91.58 The following summarizes primary drivers for the change in oil sales revenues: millions Change in Revenues Due to Change in Prices Due to Change in Volumes 2016 vs. 2015 $ (752 ) $ (745 ) $ (7 ) 2015 vs. 2014 (4,328 ) (5,189 ) 861 Oil Prices The average oil price Anadarko received decreased from late 2014 through late 2016 primarily due to continued high global petroleum inventories and strong supply growth from OPEC. Oil prices began to improve in late 2016 following OPEC decision to curb production for the first six months of 2017. 57 Table of Contents Index to Financial Statements Oil Sales Volumes 2016 vs. 2015 The Company oil sales volumes remained relatively flat. U.S. Onshore Sales volumes for the Delaware basin increased by 8 MBbls/d primarily due to continued field development. Sales volumes for the DJ basin decrease d by 6 MBbls/d primarily due to reduced capital activity. Sales volumes decreased by 7 MBbls/d primarily due to the sale of certain EOR assets in 2015 and the sale of certain Wyoming and East Texas/Louisiana assets in 2016. Gulf of Mexico Sales volumes increased by 12 MBbls/d, primarily due to new wells coming online at K2 and Caesar/Tonga in the first half of 2016, an increased flow rate at Lucius, and the achievement of first oil at Heidelberg in January 2016. International Sales volumes for Ghana decreased by 7 MBbls/d primarily due to downtime during 2016 to address new production and offtake procedures resulting from issues associated with the Jubilee field FPSO turret bearing. Shuttle tankers are conducting offtakes until the facility is permanently moored. The decrease in volumes at Jubilee were partially offset by TEN coming online late in the third quarter. 2015 vs. 2014 The Company oil sales volumes increased by 25 MBbls/d primarily due to the following: U.S. Onshore Sales volumes for the DJ basin increased by 21 MBbls/d primarily due to continued horizontal drilling activity. Sales volumes for the Delaware basin increased by 3 MBbls/d primarily due to wells brought online as a result of additional infrastructure and continued drilling. Sales volumes decreased by 10 MBbls/d primarily due to the sale of certain EOR assets in 2015. Gulf of Mexico Sales volumes for Lucius increased by 14 MBbls/d primarily due to the achievement of first oil in the first quarter of 2015. 58 Table of Contents Index to Financial Statements Natural-Gas Sales Revenues, Volumes, and Average Prices 2016 Inc (Dec) vs. 2015 2015 Inc (Dec) vs. 2014 2014 Natural-gas sales revenues (millions) $ 1,564 (22 )% $ 2,007 (48 )% $ 3,849 United States Sales volumes Bcf 766 (10 )% 852 (10 )% 945 MMcf/d 2,093 (10 ) 2,334 (10 ) 2,589 Price per Mcf $ 2.04 (14 ) $ 2.36 (42 ) $ 4.07 The following summarizes primary drivers for the change in natural-gas sales revenues: millions Change in Revenues Due to Change in Prices Due to Change in Volumes 2016 vs 2015 $ (443 ) $ (241 ) $ (202 ) 2015 vs 2014 (1,842 ) (1,462 ) (380 ) Natural-Gas Prices The average natural-gas price Anadarko received decreased from 2014 through 2016 primarily due to strong year over year production growth in the northeast United States coupled with lower weather-driven residential and commercial demand in 2015, which led to high gas storage levels in 2016. High storage levels persisted through the majority of 2016. Natural-Gas Sales Volumes 2016 vs. 2015 The Company natural-gas sales volumes decreased by 241 MMcf/d primarily due to the following: U.S. Onshore Sales volumes for the DJ basin increased by 98 MMcf/d primarily due to improved performance. Sales volumes for the Delaware basin increased by 18 MMcf/d primarily due to continued field development. Sales volumes decreased by 290 MMcf/d primarily due to the sale of certain coalbed methane properties and certain U.S. onshore properties and related midstream assets in East Texas in 2015 and the sale of certain Wyoming and East Texas/Louisiana assets in 2016. Gulf of Mexico Sales volumes decreased by 61 MMcf/d primarily as a result of the last producing well at Independence Hub going off line in December 2015. 2015 vs. 2014 The Company natural-gas sales volumes decreased by 255 MMcf/d primarily due to the following: U.S. Onshore Sales volumes for Marcellus shale decreased by 118 MMcf/d primarily due to production modulation and third-party infrastructure downtime. Sales volumes for Greater Natural Buttes decreased by 89 MMcf/d primarily due to production modulation. Sales volumes for the DJ basin increased by 144 MMcf/d primarily due to continued horizontal drilling activity. Sales volumes decreased by 137 MMcf/d primarily due to the sale of certain U.S. onshore properties and related midstream assets in East Texas and the sale of certain coalbed methane properties in 2015. Gulf of Mexico Sales volumes decreased by 60 MMcf/d primarily due to natural production decline at Independence Hub. 59 Table of Contents Index to Financial Statements Natural-Gas Liquids Sales Revenues, Volumes, and Average Prices 2016 Inc (Dec) vs. 2015 2015 Inc (Dec) vs. 2014 2014 Natural-gas liquids sales revenues (millions) $ 921 11 % $ 833 (47 )% $ 1,572 United States Sales volumes MMBbls 44 (1 )% 45 6 % 43 MBbls/d 122 (1 ) 124 6 116 Price per barrel $ 19.32 13 $ 17.03 (52 ) $ 35.48 International Sales volumes MMBbls 2 10 % 2 91 % 1 MBbls/d 6 10 6 91 3 Price per barrel $ 25.63 (14 ) $ 29.85 (47 ) $ 56.16 Total Sales volumes MMBbls 46 (1 )% 47 8 % 44 MBbls/d 128 (1 ) 130 8 119 Price per barrel $ 19.64 12 $ 17.61 (51 ) $ 36.01 The following summarizes primary drivers for the change in NGLs sales revenues: millions Change in Revenues Due to Change in Prices Due to Change in Volumes 2016 vs. 2015 $ 88 $ 95 $ (7 ) 2015 vs. 2014 (739 ) (871 ) 132 NGLs Prices The average NGLs price Anadarko received decreased from 2014 to 2015, primarily due to the related decline in oil prices over the same period. Prices began recovering in 2016 due to overall higher demand, resulting in an increase in NGLs prices in 2016. NGLs Sales Volumes NGLs sales represent revenues from the sale of products derived from the processing of Anadarko natural-gas production. The Company NGLs sales volumes remained relatively flat from 2014 through 2016. 60 Table of Contents Index to Financial Statements Gathering, Processing, and Marketing millions except percentages 2016 Inc (Dec) vs. 2015 2015 Inc (Dec) vs. 2014 2014 Gathering, processing, and marketing sales $ 1,294 6 % $ 1,226 2 % $ 1,206 Gathering, processing, and marketing expense 1,087 3 1,054 2 1,030 Total gathering, processing, and marketing, net $ 207 20 $ 172 (2 ) $ 176 Gathering and processing sales includes revenue from the sale of NGLs and remaining residue gas extracted from natural gas purchased from third parties and processed by Anadarko as well as fee revenue earned by providing gathering, processing, compression, and treating services to third parties. Marketing sales include the margin earned from purchasing and selling third-party oil and natural gas. Gathering, processing, and marketing expense includes the cost of third-party natural gas purchased and processed by Anadarko as well as other operating and transportation expenses related to the Company costs to perform gathering, processing, and marketing activities. 2016 vs. 2015 Gathering, processing, and marketing, net increased by $35 million . This increase primarily related to higher gas and NGLs throughput volumes at the DJ basin and DBM complex. 2015 vs. 2014 Gathering, processing, and marketing, net remained relatively flat.

Excluding the workforce reduction expenses, G&A decreased by $125 million primarily due to lower employee-related expenses resulting from the workforce reduction. See Note 17 Restructuring Charges in the Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements under Item 8 of this Form 10-K. 2015 vs. 2014 G&A expense decreased by $140 million primarily due to lower bonus plan expense and lower legal fees, partially offset by increased benefit plan expense. Depreciation, Depletion, and Amortization millions except percentages 2016 Inc (Dec) vs. 2015 2015 Inc (Dec) vs. 2014 2014 DD&A $ 4,301 (7 )% $ 4,603 1 % $ 4,550 2016 vs. 2015 DD&A expense decreased by $302 million , primarily due to the following: lower carrying value for U.S. onshore and midstream properties as a result of 2015 asset impairments and divestitures in 2015 and 2016 lower 2016 sales volumes associated with U.S. onshore properties 2015 vs. 2014 DD&A expense remained relatively flat. 64 Table of Contents Index to Financial Statements Impairments The Company recognized the following impairments for the years ended December 31: millions 2016 2015 2014 Oil and gas exploration and production U.S. onshore properties $ 28 $ 3,684 $ 545 Gulf of Mexico properties 27 349 276 Cost-method investment 59 3 3 Midstream 73 1,039 12 Other 40 Total impairments (1) $ 227 $ 5,075 $ 836 __________________________________________________________________ (1) In 2015, $3.0 billion of oil and gas exploration and production impairments and $482 million of midstream asset impairments related to Greater Natural Buttes. Potential for Future Impairments At December 31, 2016 , the Company estimates of undiscounted future cash flows attributable to a certain international asset group with a net book value of approximately $1.3 billion indicated that the carrying amount was expected to be recovered; however, this asset group may be at risk for impairment if the estimates of future cash flows decline. The Company estimates that a 10% decline in oil prices (with all other assumptions unchanged) could result in a non-cash impairment in excess of $550 million for the asset group. It is also reasonably possible that significant declines in commodity prices, further changes to the Company drilling plans in response to lower prices, or increases in drilling or operating costs could result in other additional impairments. See Note 5 Impairments in the Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements under Item 8 of this Form 10-K for additional information on impairments and Risk Factors under Item 1A of this Form 10-K for further discussion on the risks associated with oil, natural-gas, and NGLs prices.

Interest expense on debt and other increased by $33 million primarily related to WES debt issuances in 2015 and 2016 and interest expense related to the Ghana TEN capital lease commencement in the third quarter of 2016. Capitalized interest decreased by $32 million primarily due to lower construction-in-progress balances for long-term capital projects in Brazil and the completion of the Heidelberg development, partially offset by higher construction in progress balances related to projects in Mozambique, C te d Ivoire, and Colombia. 2015 vs. 2014 Interest expense increased by $53 million. Interest expense on debt and other increased by $16 million primarily due to higher debt outstanding during 2015, partially offset by decreased debt amortization costs for the $5.0 Billion Facility. Capitalized interest decreased by $37 million primarily due to the completion of the Lucius development and lower construction-in-progress balances for long-term capital projects in Brazil, partially offset by higher construction-in-progress balances for long-term capital projects primarily in Ghana. Income Tax Expense (Benefit) millions except percentages 2016 2015 2014 Income tax expense (benefit) $ (1,021 ) $ (2,877 ) $ 1,617 Income (loss) before income taxes (3,829 ) (9,689 ) 54 Effective tax rate 27 % 30 % 2,994 % The Company effective tax rate is impacted each year by the relative pre-tax income earned by the Company operations in the U.S., Algeria, and the rest of the world. Additionally, state income taxes (net of federal income tax benefit), non-deductible Algerian exceptional profits tax for Algerian income tax purposes, net changes in uncertain tax positions, and dispositions of non-deductible goodwill typically impact the Company effective tax rate. The 2014 effective tax rate of 2,994% was primarily attributable to net changes in uncertain tax positions related to the settlement agreement associated with the Tronox Adversary Proceeding. The Company effective tax rate decreased from 30% in 2015 to 27% in 2016 primarily due to the reversal of non-deductible goodwill due to asset divestitures in 2016. The Company generated a net operating loss in 2016 and will file a carryback claim for a tax refund of approximately $154 million in 2017. For additional information on income taxes, see Note 12 Income Taxes in the Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements under Item 8 of this Form 10-K. 66 Table of Contents Index to Financial Statements LIQUIDITY AND CAPITAL RESOURCES millions 2016 2015 2014 Net cash provided by (used in) operating activities $ 3,000 $ (1,877 ) $ 8,466 Net cash provided by (used in) investing activities (2,762 ) (4,771 ) (6,472 ) Net cash provided by (used in) financing activities 2,008 220 1,675 Overview As of December 31, 2016 , Anadarko had $3.2 billion of cash plus $5.0 billion of borrowing capacity under its revolving credit facilities. Substantially all of Anadarko cash balances at December 31, 2016 , were domiciled in the United States and were available to support its worldwide operations. In addition, future excess cash flows generated from the Company international assets are available to support both its U.S. operations and corporate needs without incurring incremental U.S. income tax. Anadarko believes that its cash, anticipated operating cash flows, and proceeds from announced asset monetizations will be sufficient to fund the Company projected 2017 operational and capital programs, providing the flexibility to accelerate activity in the Delaware and DJ basins, and potential bolt-on acquisitions in these core areas. The Company continuously monitors its liquidity position and evaluates available funding alternatives in light of current and expected conditions. The Company has a variety of funding sources available, including cash, an asset portfolio that provides ongoing cash-flow-generating capacity, opportunities for liquidity enhancement through divestitures and joint-venture arrangements that reduce future capital expenditures, and the Company credit facilities. In addition, an effective registration statement is available to Anadarko covering the sale of WGP common units owned by the Company. Effects of Moody Credit Rating Downgrade As of December 31, 2016, our long-term debt was rated BBB with a stable outlook by S&P and Fitch. Our long-term debt was rated Ba1 with a stable outlook by Moody s, which is below investment grade. As a result of Moody below-investment-grade rating of our long-term debt in February 2016, the Company credit thresholds with certain derivative counterparties were reduced and in some cases eliminated, which required the Company to increase the amount of collateral posted with derivative counterparties when the Company net trading position is a liability in excess of the contractual threshold. During the third quarter of 2016, Anadarko negotiated the increase of a credit threshold for an interest-rate derivative. As a result of the increased credit threshold, $200 million of collateral was returned to the Company. No counterparties have requested termination or full settlement of derivative positions. The aggregate fair value of derivative instruments with credit-risk-related contingent features for which a net liability position existed was $1.4 billion (net of $117 million of collateral) at December 31, 2016 , and $1.3 billion (net of $58 million of collateral) at December 31, 2015 . Furthermore, as a result of Moody rating, Anadarko is more likely to be required to post collateral in the form of letters of credit or cash as financial assurance of its performance under certain contractual arrangements such as pipeline transportation contracts and oil and gas sales contracts. The amount of letters of credit or cash provided as assurance of the Company performance under these types of contractual arrangements with respect to credit-risk-related contingent features was $274 million at December 31, 2016 , and zero at December 31, 2015 . Additionally, in February 2016, Moody downgraded Anadarko commercial paper program credit rating, which eliminated the Company access to the commercial paper market. The Company has not issued commercial paper notes since the downgrade but instead has used the 364-Day Facility for short-term working capital requirements, as needed. 67 Table of Contents Index to Financial Statements Operating Activities One of the primary sources of variability in the Company cash flows from operating activities is the fluctuation in commodity prices, the impact of which Anadarko partially mitigates by entering into commodity derivatives. Sales volume changes also impact cash flow but historically have not been as volatile as commodity prices. Anadarko cash flows from operating activities are also impacted by the costs related to operations and interest payments related to the Company outstanding debt. Cash provided by operating activities was $3.0 billion in 2016 , $4.9 billion higher compared to 2015 . This increase was a result of the $5.2 billion Tronox settlement payment in 2015 and an $881 million tax refund received in 2016 related to the income tax benefit associated with the Company 2015 tax net operating loss carryback. These increases were partially offset by $247 million related to severance costs and retirement benefits settlements in connection with the workforce reduction program and the $159.5 million payment of the CWA penalty in 2016 , with the remaining decrease primarily related to lower sales due to the impact of lower commodity prices. Cash used in operating activities was $1.9 billion in 2015 , $10.4 billion lower compared to 2014 . This decrease was a result of the $5.2 billion Tronox settlement payment in 2015 , with the remaining decrease primarily related to lower sales due to the impact of lower commodity prices. See Note 16 Contingencies Tronox Litigation in the Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements under Item 8 of this Form 10-K. Investing Activities Capital Expenditures The following presents the Company capital expenditures: millions 2016 2015 2014 Cash Flows from Investing Activities Additions to properties and equipment (1) $ 3,505 $ 6,067 $ 9,508 Adjustments for capital expenditures Changes in capital accruals (205 ) (226 ) (237 ) Other 14 47 (15 ) Total capital expenditures (2) $ 3,314 $ 5,888 $ 9,256 _______________________________________________________________________________ (1) Additions to properties and equipment as presented within Anadarko cash flows from investing activities include cash payments for cost of properties, equipment, and facilities. The cost of properties includes the initial capitalization of drilling costs associated with all exploratory wells, whether or not they were deemed to have a commercially sufficient quantity of proved reserves. (2) Includes WES capital expenditures of $491 million in 2016 , $525 million in 2015 , and $696 million in 2014 . Capital expenditures exclude the FPSO capital lease asset; see Financing Activities Capital Lease Obligations below. During 2016 , cash from operations and property divestitures were the primary sources for funding capital expenditures. The Company capital expenditures decreased by 44% for the year ended December 31, 2016 , due to the following: decreased development costs of $2.1 billion primarily in the U.S. onshore decreased exploration costs of $432 million primarily in the U.S. onshore, Colombia, and Mozambique, partially offset by increased exploration costs of $251 million in the Gulf of Mexico and C te d Ivoire decreased gathering, processing, and other capital costs of $284 million primarily in the U.S. onshore and Gulf of Mexico 68 Table of Contents Index to Financial Statements The Company capital expenditures decreased by 36% for the year ended December 31, 2015 , primarily due to reduced development and exploration activity, which resulted in the following: decreased development costs of $2.1 billion primarily in the U.S. onshore lower exploration costs of $710 million primarily in the U.S. onshore and Gulf of Mexico lower gathering, processing, and other capital costs of $498 million primarily in the U.S. onshore Carried-Interest Arrangements In 2014, the Company entered into a carried-interest arrangement that requires a third party to fund $442 million of Anadarko capital costs in exchange for a 34% working interest in the Eaglebine development, located in Southeast Texas. The third-party funding is expected to cover Anadarko future capital costs in the development through 2020. At December 31, 2016 , $151 million of the $442 million carry obligation had been funded. In 2013, the Company entered into a carried-interest arrangement that requires a third party to fund $860 million of Anadarko capital costs in exchange for a 12.75% working interest in the Heidelberg development, located in the Gulf of Mexico. At September 30, 2016, the entire $860 million carry obligation had been funded. Acquisitions In December 2016, the Company closed the GOM Acquisition for $1.8 billion . See Note 3 Acquisitions, Divestitures, and Assets Held for Sale in the Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements under Item 8 of this Form 10-K. In November 2014, WES acquired Nuevo Midstream, LLC (Nuevo), which owns and operates gathering and processing assets located in the Delaware basin in West Texas, for $1.6 billion, including $30 million of cash acquired. Following the acquisition, WES changed the name of Nuevo to DBM. Divestitures Anadarko received net proceeds related to property divestiture transactions of $2.4 billion in 2016 , $1.4 billion in 2015 , and $5.0 billion in 2014 . In December 2016, the Company entered into an agreement to sell its Marcellus oil and gas assets and certain related midstream assets for approximately $1.2 billion. These assets were classified as held for sale as of December 31, 2016 . In January 2017, the Company entered into an agreement to sell its Eagleford oil and gas assets for approximately $2.3 billion. The Company expects these transactions to close in the first quarter of 2017 generating approximately $3.5 billion in cash proceeds.

Insurance Coverage and Other Indemnities Anadarko maintains property and casualty insurance that includes coverage for physical damage to the Company properties, blowout/control of a well, restoration and redrill, sudden and accidental pollution, third-party liability, workers compensation and employers liability, and other risks. Anadarko insurance coverage includes deductibles that must be met prior to recovery. Additionally, the Company insurance is subject to exclusions and limitations, and there is no assurance that such coverage will adequately protect the Company against liability or loss from all potential consequences and damages. The Company current insurance coverage includes (a) $400 million per occurrence from Oil Insurance Limited (OIL) for physical damage to Anadarko properties on a replacement cost basis, blowout/control of well, restoration and redrill, and sudden and accidental pollution; (b) $1.2 billion per occurrence from the commercial markets for the items described in item (a) above, which is in excess of the OIL coverage and which follows the form of OIL coverage with certain exceptions; (c) $400 million from the commercial markets, which scales to Anadarko working interest, for third-party liabilities, including sudden and accidental pollution and aviation liability; and (d) $275 million for aircraft liability (in addition to the third-party liability limits described in item (c) above). Anadarko does not carry significant coverage for loss of production income from any of the Company facilities or for any losses that result from the effects of a named windstorm. The Company service agreements, including drilling contracts, generally indemnify Anadarko for injuries and death to employees of the service provider and subcontractors hired by the service provider as well as for property damage suffered by the service provider and its contractors. Also, these service agreements generally indemnify Anadarko for pollution originating from the equipment of any contractors or subcontractors hired by the service provider. Off-Balance-Sheet Arrangements Anadarko may enter into off-balance-sheet arrangements and transactions that can give rise to material off-balance-sheet obligations. The Company material off-balance-sheet arrangements and transactions include operating lease arrangements and undrawn letters of credit. In addition, the Company enters into other contractual agreements in the normal course of business for processing, treating, transportation, and storage of oil, natural gas, and NGLs as well as for other oil and gas activities as discussed below in Obligations . Other than the items discussed above, there are no other transactions, arrangements, or other relationships with unconsolidated entities or other persons that are reasonably likely to materially affect Anadarko liquidity or availability of or requirements for capital resources. 73 Table of Contents Index to Financial Statements Obligations The following is a summary of the Company obligations at December 31, 2016 : Obligations by Period millions Note Reference (1) 2017 2018-2019 2020-2021 2022 and beyond Total Total debt Principal total borrowings (2) Note 11 $ 34 $ 1,409 $ 1,300 $ 13,963 $ 16,706 Interest on borrowings Note 11 862 1,667 1,506 9,332 13,367 Capital lease obligation and interest Note 11 57 84 85 391 617 Investee entities debt and interest (3) Note 8 61 167 196 5,060 5,484 Operating leases Note 15 673 714 110 23 1,520 Oil and gas activities (4) Note 15 478 542 178 125 1,323 Midstream and marketing activities Note 15 850 1,666 1,433 1,099 5,048 AROs Note 13 137 234 520 2,040 2,931 Derivative liabilities (5) Note 9 159 803 438 1,400 Uncertain tax positions Note 12 70 85 1,301 1,456 Other (6) 19 166 71 96 352 Total (7) $ 3,400 $ 7,537 $ 5,837 $ 33,430 $ 50,204 _______________________________________________________________________________ (1) For additional information, see the Notes to the Consolidated Financial Statements under Item 8 of this Form 10-K.

See Note 1 Summary of Significant Accounting Policies in the Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements under Item 8 of this Form 10-K for discussion of the Company significant accounting policies. Changes in facts and circumstances or additional information may result in revised estimates, and actual results may differ from these estimates. Management considers the following to be its most critical accounting estimates that involve judgment. The selection, development, and disclosure of these estimates is discussed with the Company Audit Committee. Proved Reserves Methodology Anadarko estimates its proved oil and gas reserves according to the definition of proved reserves provided by the SEC and the Financial Accounting Standards Board. This definition includes oil, natural gas, and NGLs that geological and engineering data demonstrate with reasonable certainty to be economically producible in future periods from known reservoirs under existing economic conditions, operating methods, government regulations, etc. (at prices and costs as of the date the estimates are made). Prices include consideration of price changes provided only by contractual arrangements, and do not include adjustments based on expected future conditions. For reserves information, see Oil and Gas Properties and Activities Proved Reserves under Items 1 and 2 of this Form 10-K and the Supplemental Information on Oil and Gas Exploration and Production Activities under Item 8 of this Form 10-K. Judgments and uncertainties Engineering estimates of the quantities of proved reserves are inherently imprecise and represent only approximate amounts because of the judgments involved in developing such information. The Company estimates of proved reserves are made using available geological and reservoir data as well as production performance data. The reliability of these estimates at any point in time depends on both the quality and quantity of the technical and economic data and the efficiency of extracting and processing the hydrocarbons. These estimates are reviewed annually by internal reservoir engineers and revised, either upward or downward, as warranted by additional data. Revisions are necessary due to changes in, among other things, development plans, reservoir performance, prices, economic conditions, and governmental restrictions as well as changes in the expected recovery associated with infill drilling. Decreases in prices, for example, may cause a reduction in some proved reserves due to reaching economic limits at an earlier projected date. A material adverse change in the estimated volumes of proved reserves could have a negative impact on DD&A and could result in property impairments. If the estimates of proved reserves used in the UOP calculations had been lower by five percent across all properties, DD&A in 2016 would have increased by approximately $211 million. 75 Table of Contents Index to Financial Statements Exploratory Costs Methodology Under the successful efforts method of accounting, exploratory drilling costs are initially capitalized pending the determination of proved reserves. If proved reserves are found, drilling costs remain capitalized and are classified as proved properties. For exploratory wells that find reserves that cannot be classified as proved when drilling is completed, costs continue to be capitalized as suspended exploratory drilling costs if there have been sufficient reserves found to justify completion as a producing well and sufficient progress is being made in assessing the reserves and the economic and operating viability of the project. At the end of each quarter, management reviews the status of all suspended exploratory drilling costs in light of ongoing exploration activities, in particular, whether the Company is making sufficient progress in its ongoing exploration and appraisal efforts or, in the case of discoveries requiring government sanctioning, analyzing whether development negotiations are underway and proceeding as planned. Judgments and uncertainties Significant management judgment is required to determine whether sufficient progress has been made in assessing the reserves and the economic and operating viability of the project to continue capitalization of the exploratory drilling costs. In making this determination all relevant facts and circumstances shall be evaluated, and no single indicator is determinative. Relevant facts and circumstances include, but are not limited to, commitment of project personnel, costs being incurred to assess the reserves and their potential development, assessment in progress covering the economic, legal, political, and environmental aspects of the potential development, and the existence or active negotiations of agreements with governments or sales contracts with customers. The determination of proved reserves may take longer than one year in certain areas (generally in deepwater and international locations) depending on, among other things, the amount of hydrocarbons discovered, the outcome of planned geological and engineering studies, the need for additional appraisal drilling activities to determine whether the discovery is sufficient to support an economic development plan, and government sanctioning of development activities in certain international locations. If management determines that future appraisal drilling or development activities are unlikely to occur, associated suspended exploratory well costs are expensed. Therefore, at any point in time, the Company may have capitalized costs on its Consolidated Balance Sheets associated with exploratory wells that may be charged to exploration expense in future periods. See Note 6 Suspended Exploratory Well Costs in the Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements under Item 8 of this Form 10-K for additional information. Fair Value Methodology The Company estimates fair value of long-lived assets for impairment testing, reporting units for goodwill impairment testing when necessary, assets and liabilities acquired in a business combination or exchanged in non-monetary transactions, pension plan assets, and initial measurements of AROs. Judgments and uncertainties When the Company is required to measure fair value and there is not a market-observable price for the asset or liability or for a similar asset or liability, the Company uses the cost or income approaches depending on the quality of information available to support management assumptions. The cost approach is based on management best estimate of the current asset replacement cost. The income approach is based on management best assumptions regarding expectations of future net cash flows and discounts the expected cash flows using a commensurate risk-adjusted discount rate. Such evaluations involve significant judgment, and the results are based on expected future events or conditions such as sales prices, estimates of future oil and gas production or throughput, development and operating costs and the timing thereof, economic and regulatory climates, and other factors, most of which are often outside of management control. However, assumptions used reflect a market participant view of long-term prices, costs, and other factors and are consistent with assumptions used in the Company business plans and investment decisions. 76 Table of Contents Index to Financial Statements Impairments of Proved Oil and Natural-Gas Properties Methodology Proved oil and natural-gas properties are assessed for impairment when facts and circumstances indicate that net book values may not be recoverable. When impairment indicators are present, an undiscounted cash flow test is performed at the lowest level for which identifiable cash flows are independent of cash flows from other assets. If the sum of the undiscounted future net cash flows is less than the net book value of the property, the property fair value is estimated and an impairment loss is recognized for the excess, if any, of the property net book value over its estimated fair value. Judgments and uncertainties The primary assumptions used to estimate undiscounted future net cash flows include anticipated future production, commodity prices, and capital and operating costs. In most cases, the assumption that generates the most variability in undiscounted future net cash flows is future oil and natural-gas prices. For impairment testing, the Company used the five-year forward strip prices for oil and natural gas, with prices subsequent to the fifth year held constant as the benchmark price in the undiscounted future net cash flows. Due to the volatility of crude oil, natural gas, and NGL prices, these cash flow estimates are inherently imprecise. Capital and operating costs were estimated assuming 0% escalation for years where the average oil strip price was below $50 per Bbl and 1% escalation for years where the average oil strip price exceeded $50 per Bbl. Unfavorable changes in any of the primary assumptions could result in a reduction in undiscounted future cash flows and could indicate property impairment. Uncertainties related to the primary assumptions could affect the timing of an impairment. Impairments of Unproved Oil and Natural-Gas Properties Methodology Acquisition costs of unproved oil and natural-gas properties are periodically assessed for impairment and are transferred to proved oil and gas properties to the extent the costs are associated with successful exploration activities. The Company has classified unproved oil and natural-gas properties into three categories: significant, significant where probable and possible reserve estimations are available, and individually insignificant. Significant undeveloped leases are assessed individually for impairment and a valuation allowance is provided if impairment is indicated. In situations where fair values have been allocated to a significant unproved property based on estimations of probable and/or possible reserves as the result of a business combination or other purchase of proved and unproved properties, a future cash flow analysis is used to assess the property for impairment in addition to consideration of reserve volumes needed to transfer the balance of unproved property to proved leasehold. Unproved oil and gas properties with individually insignificant lease acquisition costs are amortized on a group basis (thereby establishing a valuation allowance) over the average lease terms at rates that provide for full amortization of unsuccessful leases upon lease expiration or abandonment. Judgments and uncertainties In determining whether a significant unproved property is impaired numerous factors are considered including, but not limited to, current exploration plans, favorable or unfavorable exploration activity on the property being evaluated and/or adjacent properties, our geologists evaluation of the property, and the remaining months in the lease term for the property. In situations where probable and possible reserves are available, cash flows used in the impairment analysis are determined based upon management estimates of probable and possible reserves, future commodity prices, and future costs to produce the reserves. If undiscounted future net cash flows are less than the carrying value of the property, indicating impairment, the cash flows are discounted and compared to the carrying value for determining the amount of the impairment loss to record. The Company utilizes the same pricing assumptions discussed above in Impairments of Proved Oil and Natural-Gas Properties. Uncertainties related to the primary assumptions or unfavorable revisions in estimated reserve quantities could cause a reduction in the value of a property and therefore indicate an impairment. Management assessment of the results of exploration activities, availability of funds for future activities, and the current and projected political and regulatory climate in areas in which we operate also impact the amounts and timing of impairment provisions. 77 Table of Contents Index to Financial Statements Purchase Price Allocations Methodology In connection with a business combination accounted for under the acquisition method, the acquiring company must recognize and measure assets acquired and liabilities assumed at fair value as of the acquisition date. Deferred taxes must be recorded for any differences between the assigned values and tax bases of assets and liabilities. Any excess of the purchase price over fair value assigned to assets and liabilities is recorded as goodwill. Any excess of fair value assigned to assets and liabilities over the purchase price is recorded as a gain from a bargain purchase. The amount of goodwill or gain from a bargain purchase recorded in any particular business combination can vary significantly depending upon the values attributed to assets acquired and liabilities assumed. Judgments and uncertainties In estimating the fair values of assets acquired and liabilities assumed in a business combination, various assumptions are made. The most significant assumptions relate to the estimated fair values assigned to proved and unproved crude oil and natural gas properties. If sufficient market data is not available regarding the fair values of proved and unproved properties, estimates of the fair value of crude oil, natural-gas and NGL reserves are prepared. Estimates of future prices to apply to the estimated reserves quantities acquired and estimates of future operating and development costs are used to estimate future net cash flows. For estimated proved reserves, the future net cash flows are discounted using a market-based discount rate determined appropriate at the time of the acquisition. Estimated deferred taxes are based on available information concerning the tax bases of assets acquired and liabilities assumed and loss carryforwards at the acquisition date, although such estimates may change in the future as additional information becomes known. Estimated fair values of assets acquired can have a significant effect on results of operations in the future. A higher fair value assigned to a property results in higher DD&A expense, which results in lower net earnings. Fair values are based on estimates of future commodity prices, reserves quantities, operating expenses, and development costs. This increases the likelihood of impairment if future commodity prices or reserves quantities are lower than those originally used to determine fair value, or if future operating expenses or development costs are higher than those originally used to determine fair value. Impairment would have no effect on cash flows but would result in a decrease in net income for the period in which the impairment is recorded. 78 Table of Contents Index to Financial Statements Goodwill Impairments Methodology The Company tests goodwill for impairment annually in October (or more frequently as circumstances dictate). The Company first assesses whether an impairment of goodwill is indicated through a qualitative assessment to determine the likelihood of whether the fair value of the reporting unit is less than its carrying amount, including goodwill. If the Company concludes it is more likely than not that fair value of the reporting unit exceeds the related carrying amount, then goodwill is not impaired and further testing is not necessary. If the qualitative assessment indicates fair value of the reporting unit may be less than its carrying amount, the Company compares the estimated fair value of the reporting unit to which goodwill is assigned to the carrying amount of the associated net assets, including goodwill, and determines whether impairment is necessary. When evaluating whether it is more likely than not that the fair value of a reporting unit is less than its carrying amount, the Company assesses relevant events and circumstances, including the following: significant changes in the stock price of Anadarko, WES, and WGP significant declines in commodity prices significant increases in cost factors such as costs of drilling, production costs, and gathering, processing, and other transportation costs impairments recognized by the Company acquisitions and disposals of assets changes to the Company reserves, including changes due to fluctuations in commodity prices and updates to the Company plans or forecasts significant declines in trading multiples for midstream peers Judgments and uncertainties Because quoted market prices for the Company reporting units are not available, management applies judgment in determining the estimated fair value of reporting units for purposes of performing goodwill impairment tests, when such tests are necessary. Management uses information available to make these fair-value estimates, including the present values of expected future cash flows using discount rates commensurate with the risks associated with the assets and the oil and gas exploration and production reporting unit, control premiums and market multiples of earnings before interest, taxes, depreciation, and amortization (EBITDA) for the gathering and processing and transportation reporting units. In estimating the fair value of its oil and gas exploration and production reporting unit, the Company assumes production profiles used in its estimation of reserves that are disclosed in the Company supplemental oil and gas disclosures, market prices based on the forward price curve for oil and gas at the test date (adjusted for location and quality differentials), capital and operating costs consistent with pricing and expected inflation rates, and discount rates that management believes a market participant would use based upon the risks inherent in Anadarko operations. Management also includes control premium assumptions based on observable market information regarding how a market participant would value the oil and gas exploration and production reporting unit as a whole rather than as individual properties that are part of an oil and gas portfolio. The Company estimates fair value for the WES gathering and processing, WES transportation, and other gathering and processing reporting units by applying an estimated multiple to projected EBITDA. The Company considered observable transactions in the market and trading multiples for peers in determining an appropriate multiple to apply against the Company projected EBITDA for these reporting units. A lower fair-value estimate in the future for any of these reporting units could result in impairment of goodwill. Factors that could trigger a lower fair-value estimate include significant declines in commodity prices, decreases in proved reserves, changes in exploration or development plans, significant property impairments, increases in operating or drilling costs, significant changes in regulations, or other negative changes to the economic environment in which Anadarko operates. 79 Table of Contents Index to Financial Statements Contingencies Methodology The Company is subject to various legal proceedings, claims, and liabilities that arise in the ordinary course of business. Except for contingencies acquired in a business combination, which are recorded at fair value at the time of acquisition, the Company accrues losses when such losses are probable and reasonably estimable. If the Company determines that a loss is probable and cannot estimate a specific amount for that loss, but can estimate a range of loss, the best estimate within the range is accrued. If no amount within the range is a better estimate than any other, the minimum amount of the range is accrued. The Company in-house legal counsel personnel regularly assess contingent liabilities and, in certain circumstances, consult with third-party legal counsel or consultants to assist in the evaluation of the Company liability for these contingencies. Judgments and uncertainties Management makes judgments and estimates when it establishes liabilities for litigation and other contingent matters. Estimates of litigation-related liabilities are based on the facts and circumstances of the individual case and on information currently available to the Company. The extent of information available varies based on the status of the litigation and the Company evaluation of the claim and legal arguments. In future periods, a number of factors could significantly change the Company estimate of litigation-related liabilities, including discovery activities; briefings filed with the relevant court; rulings from the court made pre-trial, during trial, or at the conclusion of any trial; and similar cases involving other plaintiffs and defendants that may set or change legal precedent. As events unfold throughout the litigation process, the Company evaluates the available information and may consult with third-party legal counsel to determine whether liability accruals should be established or adjusted. Income Taxes Methodology We are subject to income taxes in numerous taxing jurisdictions worldwide. The amount of income taxes recorded by the Company requires interpretations of complex rules and regulations of various tax jurisdictions throughout the world. The Company has recognized deferred tax assets and liabilities for temporary differences, operating losses, and tax-credit carryforwards. The deferred tax assets may be reduced by a valuation allowance if it is more likely than not that some portion or all of the deferred tax assets will not be realized. The Company routinely assesses the realizability of its deferred tax assets by analyzing the reversal periods of available net operating loss carryforwards and credit carryforwards, temporary differences in tax assets and liabilities, the availability of tax planning strategies, and estimates of future taxable income and other factors. The Company also routinely assesses potential uncertain tax positions and, if required, establishes accruals for such amounts, including interest where appropriate. The Company recognizes a tax benefit from an uncertain tax position when it is more likely than not that the position will be sustained upon examination, based on the technical merits of the position. Judgments and uncertainties The accruals for deferred tax assets and liabilities, including deferred state income tax assets and liabilities, are subject to significant judgment by management and are reviewed and adjusted routinely based on changes in facts and circumstances. The assessment of potential uncertain tax positions requires a significant amount of judgment and are reviewed and adjusted on a periodic basis, taking into consideration the progress of ongoing tax audits, case law, and new legislation. Although management considers its tax accruals adequate, material changes in these accruals may occur in the future based on the progress of ongoing tax audits, changes in legislation, and resolution of pending tax matters. Additionally, numerous judgments and assumptions are inherent in our estimates of future taxable income used to assess the realizability of certain deferred tax assets. The estimates used are based on assumptions of proved oil and gas reserves, selling prices, and development assumptions that are consistent with the Company internal business plans.
