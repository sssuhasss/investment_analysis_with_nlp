Item 7. Management Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations This Management Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations, or MD&A, should be read in conjunction with our consolidated financial statements and notes thereto that appear elsewhere in this annual report on Form 10-K. See Risk Factors elsewhere in this annual report on Form 10-K for a discussion of certain risks associated with our business. The following discussion contains forward-looking statements. The forward-looking statements do not include the potential impact of any mergers, acquisitions, divestitures, or other events that may be announced after the date hereof. Overview We primarily derive income from sales of services to customers executing contracts with terms of one year or longer. We believe that this emphasis on longer-term contracts generally allows us to have a consistent and predictable base level of 23 Table of Contents revenue which is important to our financial success. Accordingly, to be successful, we must maintain our base of recurring revenue contracts by minimizing customer cancellations or terminations and limiting the impact of price reductions reflected in contract renewals, and build on that base by adding new customers and increasing the number and quality of services, features and functionalities that our existing customers purchase. Accomplishing these goals requires that we compete effectively in the marketplace on the basis of the quality, price and the attractiveness of our services and technology. Our revenue is impacted by a number of factors, including our ability to maintain our base of committed recurring revenues, the timing and variability of customer-specific one-time events, prices we are able to charge for our services, the amount of traffic we serve on our network and the impact of seasonal variations on our business. We have observed the following trends related to our revenue during 2013 : We have been able to offset lost committed recurring revenue by adding new customers and increasing sales of incremental services to our existing customers. Consistent with prior years, the unit prices offered to some customers have declined as a result of increased competition. These price reductions have primarily impacted customers for which we deliver high volumes of traffic over our network, such as media customers. We experienced an increase in the rate of traffic in our video, gaming, social media and software download solutions as compared to 2012 . We experienced variations in certain types of revenue from quarter to quarter in 2013; in particular, we experienced higher revenue in the fourth quarter of the year for some of our solutions as a result of the holiday season. We also saw lower revenue in the summer months, particularly in Europe, from both e-commerce and media customers because overall Internet use declined during that time. We also experienced quarterly variations in revenue attributable to the nature and timing of software releases by our customers using our software download solutions. Our profitability is also impacted by our expense levels, including direct costs to support our revenue, such as co-location and bandwidth costs, and expenses incurred to support strategic initiatives that we anticipate will generate revenue in the future. We observed the following trends during 2013 and discuss our expectations related to our cost of revenue and operating expenses: We continued to reduce our network bandwidth costs per unit and to invest in internal-use software development to improve the performance and efficiency of our network. Our total bandwidth costs may increase in the future as a result of expected higher traffic levels, but we believe such costs would be partially offset by anticipated continued reductions in bandwidth costs per unit. To achieve these lower bandwidth costs per unit, we must effectively route traffic over our network through lower cost providers and continue to reduce our overall bandwidth pricing. Co-location costs are a significant percentage of total cost of revenue. By improving our internal-use software and managing our hardware deployments to enable us to use servers more efficiently, we have been able to manage the growth of co-location costs. We expect to continue to scale our network in the future and will need to manage our co-location costs to maintain current levels of profitability. Effective January 1, 2013, we increased the expected average useful lives of our network assets, primarily servers, from three to four years to reflect software and hardware related initiatives to manage our global network more efficiently. This change decreased depreciation expense related to our network equipment during 2013, as compared to 2012 and 2011. Conversely, we expect to continue to enhance and add functionality to our service offerings, which increases our internal-use software development costs attributable to employees working on such projects. We increased our headcount by more than 800 employees in 2013 to 3,908 employees at year end, which is net of approximately 70 employees who were part of the divestiture of our ADS business in the first quarter of 2013. We expect to continue to hire additional employees as we release new products and services, as well as continue our global expansion. During 2013 we completed two acquisitions, and in 2012 we completed four acquisitions. The acquisitions were not material, individually or in the aggregate, to our consolidated financial results. In December 2013, we also entered into a definitive agreement to acquire Prolexic for approximately $390.0 million in cash and the assumption of unvested options, subject to post-closing adjustments. The acquisition closed in February 2014. Prolexic has approximately 200 employees, and the acquisition is expected to be slightly dilutive to our earnings per share. 24 Table of Contents Results of Operations The following sets forth, as a percentage of revenue, consolidated statements of operations data for the years indicated: 2013 2012 2011 Revenue 100.0 % 100.0 % 100.0 % Costs and operating expenses: Cost of revenue 32.4 38.6 39.2 Research and development 5.9 5.4 4.5 Sales and marketing 17.8 16.3 14.1 General and administrative 16.2 15.3 15.3 Amortization of acquired intangible assets 1.4 1.5 1.5 Restructuring charges 0.1 0.4 Total costs and operating expenses 73.8 77.1 74.9 Income from operations 26.2 22.9 25.1 Interest income, net 0.4 0.5 0.9 Other (expense) income, net 0.5 Income before provision for income taxes 26.6 23.4 26.5 Provision for income taxes 8.0 8.6 9.2 Net income 18.6 % 14.8 % 17.3 % Revenue Revenue during the periods presented is as follows (in thousands): For the Years Ended December 31, For the Years Ended December 31, 2013 2012 % Change 2012 2011 % Change Revenue $ 1,577,922 $ 1,373,947 14.8 % $ 1,373,947 $ 1,158,538 18.6 % The increase in our revenue from 2012 to 2013 was driven by continued strong demand for our services. The increase was attributable to the addition of new customers, increased sales of incremental services to our existing customers and amounts earned for traffic usage in excess of committed amounts and customer-specific one-time events. These contributions to higher revenue were partially offset by lost committed recurring revenue, price declines and the divestiture of ADS. The increase in our revenue from 2011 to 2012 was primarily due to the continued growth in use of the Internet by businesses and consumers, leading to increased purchases of our solutions by our customers. Additionally, our growth rate in 2012 benefited from revenues from our acquisitions in 2012. For the year ended December 31, 2013, resellers accounted for 21% of revenue as compared to 22% and 19% of revenue, respectively, for the years ended December 31, 2012 and 2011. For the years ended December 31, 2013, 2012 and 2011 , no single customer accounted for 10% or more of revenue. For the years ended December 31, 2013, 2012 and 2011, approximately 29% , 28% and 29% , respectively, of our revenue was derived from our operations located outside of the United States. No single country outside of the United States accounted for 10% or more of revenue during any of these periods. During 2013 we continued to see strong growth from our operations in the Asia Pacific region, and our operations in Europe, the Middle East and Africa performed well, despite continued macroeconomic factors. Changes in foreign currency exchange rates negatively impacted our revenue by $15.0 million during fiscal year 2013 as compared to 2012 . 25 Table of Contents The following table quantifies the contribution to revenue during the periods presented from our solution categories (in thousands): For the Years Ended December 31, For the Years Ended December 31, 2013 2012 % Change 2012 2011 % Change Media Delivery Solutions $ 757,147 $ 652,968 16.0 % $ 652,968 $ 567,586 15.0 % Performance and Security Solutions 690,559 583,818 18.3 583,818 478,605 22.0 Service and Support Solutions 128,087 93,830 36.5 93,830 69,170 35.7 Advertising Decision Solutions and other 2,129 43,331 (95.1 ) 43,331 43,177 0.4 Total revenue $ 1,577,922 $ 1,373,947 14.8 % $ 1,373,947 $ 1,158,538 18.6 % The increases in Media Delivery Solutions revenue for 2013 as compared to 2012 , and 2012 as compared to 2011 , were due to increased consumption of our customers' online media offerings and higher software download volumes. During 2013 , we experienced strong growth in usage by some of our largest, most strategic accounts driven by increased software downloads, gaming, video delivery and social media consumption, all of which contributed to our year-over-year revenue growth. These increases were partially offset by a large media customer finalizing the removal of its video content from our platform during 2013 resulting in loss of revenue as compared to 2012 . The increases in Performance and Security Solutions revenue for 2013 as compared to 2012 , and 2012 as compared to 2011 , were due to increases in demand for our Performance and Security Solutions from both new and existing customers. During 2013, we experienced strong demand for our website and application acceleration solutions as well as our security offerings. The increases in the Service and Support Solutions revenue for 2013 as compared to 2012 , and 2012 as compared to 2011 , were due to increases in sales of our services and support offerings due to strong service attachment rates for both customers of our core Media Delivery and Performance and Security Solutions. The Advertising Decision Solutions business was divested in the first quarter of 2013. Cost of Revenue Cost of revenue consisted of the following for the periods presented (in thousands): For the Years Ended December 31, For the Years Ended December 31, 2013 2012 % Change 2012 2011 % Change Bandwidth and service-related fees $ 100,964 $ 114,595 (11.9 )% $ 114,595 $ 92,015 24.5 % Co-location fees 129,382 131,942 (1.9 ) 131,942 130,879 0.8 Network build-out and support 21,173 16,919 25.1 16,919 14,820 14.2 Payroll and related costs 112,806 91,954 22.7 91,954 72,399 27.0 Stock-based compensation, including amortization of prior capitalized amounts 18,568 18,731 (0.9 ) 18,731 16,827 11.3 Depreciation and impairment of network equipment 83,811 117,997 (29.0 ) 117,997 96,741 22.0 Amortization of internal-use software 44,383 37,762 17.5 37,762 30,024 25.8 Total cost of revenue $ 511,087 $ 529,900 (3.6 )% $ 529,900 $ 453,705 16.8 % As a percentage of revenue 32.4 % 38.6 % 38.6 % 39.2 % In recent years, we have continued to reduce our network bandwidth costs per unit, co-location fees and other network-related expenses, which has had the impact of decreasing cost of revenue as a percentage of revenue. 26 Table of Contents This net decrease in cost of revenue was primarily due to decreases in: depreciation expense of network equipment in place as of January 1, 2013 of approximately $39.0 million reflecting the increase in the expected average useful lives of our network assets, primarily servers, from three to four years to reflect software and hardware related initiatives to manage our global network more efficiently; bandwidth and service-related fees of our ADS business, which we divested in January 2013; these expenses were $1.6 million and $24.2 million for the years ended December 31, 2013 and 2012, respectively; and amounts paid to network providers due to lower bandwidth and service-related fees due to reduced bandwidth costs per unit. These decreases were partially offset by increases in: payroll and related costs of service personnel due to headcount growth to support our Service and Support Solutions revenue growth and our efforts to efficiently scale our network; and amortization of internal-use software as we continued to invest in our infrastructure. Cost of revenue increased in 2012 as compared to 2011, primarily due to an increase in amounts paid to network providers for bandwidth due to higher traffic levels. The increases were partially offset by reduced bandwidth costs per unit, an increase in depreciation expense of network equipment and amortization of internal-use software as we continued to invest in our infrastructure. Cost of revenue for the years ended December 31, 2013, 2012 and 2011 also included credits received of approximately $9.1 million , $10.8 million and $6.9 million , respectively, from billing settlements and renegotiations related to bandwidth contracts. We have long-term purchase commitments for bandwidth usage and co-location services with various network and Internet service providers. See Note 9 to our consolidated financial statements included elsewhere in this annual report on Form 10-K for further discussion. We believe that cost of revenue will increase during 2014 as compared to 2013 . We expect to deploy more servers and deliver more traffic on our network, which will result in higher expenses associated with the increased traffic and additional co-location fees; however, such costs are likely to be partially offset by lower bandwidth costs per unit and continued efficiency in network deployment. Additionally, during 2014 , we anticipate amortization of internal-use software development costs as comparted to 2013 to increase, along with increased payroll and related costs associated with our network and professional services personnel and related expenses. We plan to continue to make investments in our network in the expectation that our customer base will continue to expand. We have revised cost of revenue reported in 2012 and 2011 in the table above as a result of a reevaluation of our business model. Costs that were previously classified as sales and marketing and general and administrative are now classified as cost of revenue. See Note 1 to our consolidated financial statements included elsewhere in this annual report on Form 10-K for additional information and amounts revised. Research and Development Expenses Research and development expenses consisted of the following for the periods presented (in thousands): For the Years Ended December 31, For the Years Ended December 31, 2013 2012 % Change 2012 2011 % Change Payroll and related costs $ 139,018 $ 104,244 33.4 % $ 104,244 $ 78,425 32.9 % Stock-based compensation 17,472 17,275 1.1 17,275 11,124 55.3 Capitalized salaries and related costs (67,935 ) (50,648 ) 34.1 (50,648 ) (40,383 ) 25.4 Other expenses 5,324 3,873 37.5 3,873 3,167 22.3 Total research and development $ 93,879 $ 74,744 25.6 % $ 74,744 $ 52,333 42.8 % As a percentage of revenue 5.9 % 5.4 % 5.4 % 4.5 % 27 Table of Contents The increases in research and development expenses for 2013 as compared to 2012 , and 2012 as compared to 2011 , were due to increases in payroll and related costs as a result of continued growth in headcount to invest in new product development, partially offset by increases in capitalized salaries and related costs. Research and development costs are expensed as incurred, other than certain internal-use software development costs eligible for capitalization. These development costs consist of external consulting expenses and payroll and related costs for personnel involved in the development of internal-use software used to deliver our services and operate our network. For the years ended December 31, 2013, 2012 and 2011 , we capitalized $11.5 million , $8.9 million and $7.1 million , respectively, of stock-based compensation. These capitalized internal-use software costs are amortized to cost of revenue over their estimated useful lives of two years. We believe that research and development expenses will increase in absolute dollars during 2014 as compared to 2013 as we expect to continue to hire additional development personnel in order to make improvements to our core technology and support the development of new services and engineering innovation. Sales and Marketing Expenses Sales and marketing expenses consisted of the following for the periods presented (in thousands): For the Years Ended December 31, For the Years Ended December 31, 2013 2012 % Change 2012 2011 % Change Payroll and related costs $ 191,554 $ 147,571 29.8 % $ 147,571 $ 113,553 30.0 % Stock-based compensation 39,290 34,322 14.5 34,322 20,697 65.8 Marketing programs and related costs 26,449 23,508 12.5 23,508 13,137 78.9 Other expenses 23,087 17,947 28.6 17,947 15,630 14.8 Total sales and marketing $ 280,380 $ 223,348 25.5 % $ 223,348 $ 163,017 37.0 % As a percentage of revenue 17.8 % 16.3 % 16.3 % 14.1 % The increases in sales and marketing expenses for 2013 as compared to 2012 , and 2012 as compared to 2011 , were primarily due to higher payroll and related costs, including commissions for sales and support personnel and stock-based compensation. We increased hiring in our sales organization in support of our go-to-market capacity and ongoing geographic expansion, which contributed to the increases. Other expenses, which consists primarily of sales and marketing events and related travel expenses, increased as we supported our revenue goals. We believe that sales and marketing expenses will increase in absolute dollars during 2014 as compared to 2013 due to an expected increase in payroll and related costs as a result of anticipated continued headcount growth in our sales and marketing organization. General and Administrative Expenses General and administrative expenses consisted of the following for the periods presented (in thousands): For the Years Ended December 31, For the Years Ended December 31, 2013 2012 % Change 2012 2011 % Change Payroll and related costs $ 105,205 $ 83,845 25.5 % $ 83,845 $ 67,298 24.6 % Stock-based compensation 28,255 27,679 2.1 27,679 19,830 39.6 Depreciation 26,991 20,018 34.8 20,018 12,876 55.5 Facilities-related costs 44,030 34,570 27.4 34,570 33,951 1.8 Provision for doubtful accounts 475 (1,402 ) 133.9 (1,402 ) 367 (482.0 ) Acquisition-related costs 1,842 5,788 (68.2 ) 5,788 580 897.9 Professional and other fees 48,420 39,602 22.3 39,602 41,976 (5.7 ) Total general and administrative $ 255,218 $ 210,100 21.5 % $ 210,100 $ 176,878 18.8 % As a percentage of revenue 16.2 % 15.3 % 15.3 % 15.3 % 28 Table of Contents General and administrative expenses include costs of our finance, human resources, information technology, legal and administrative network infrastructure functions, in addition to our facility-related costs and deprecation of facility-related capital assets. The increases in general and administrative expenses for 2013 as compared to 2012 , and 2012 as compared to 2011 , were primarily due to the expansion of company infrastructure to support investments in engineering, network scaling and go-to-market capacity. Specifically, we had increases to headcount, external consulting support and our facility footprint. These actions increased payroll and related costs, network procurement costs, facilities-related costs and depreciation during 2013 as compared to 2012 , and 2012 as compared to 2011 . During 2014 , we expect general and administrative expenses to increase in absolute dollars as compared to 2013 due to anticipated higher payroll and related costs and facilities-related costs attributable to increased hiring, investment in information technology, network scaling and planned facility expansion. Amortization of Acquired Intangible Assets For the Years Ended December 31, For the Years Ended December 31, (in thousands) 2013 2012 % Change 2012 2011 % Change Amortization of acquired intangible assets $ 21,547 $ 20,962 2.8 % $ 20,962 $ 17,070 22.8 % As a percentage of revenue 1.4 % 1.5 % 1.5 % 1.5 % The increase in amortization of acquired intangible assets during 2013 as compared to 2012 was due to the acquisition of strategic network assets from AT&T Services, Inc. and also a full year of amortization from the acquisitions occurring throughout 2012, which was partially offset by the write-off of intangible assets recorded as part of the divestiture of ADS in 2013 and the completion of amortization of intangible assets acquired in previous years. The increase in amortization of acquired intangible assets during 2012 as compared to 2011 was due to the amortization of assets related to the acquisitions of Blaze Software, Inc., or Blaze, Cotendo, Inc., or Cotendo, FastSoft, Inc., or FastSoft, and Verivue, Inc., or Verivue, during 2012. Based on acquired intangible assets at December 31, 2013 , future amortization was expected to be approximately $20.6 million , $18.9 million , $14.5 million , $10.2 million and $4.4 million for the years ending December 31, 2014 , 2015 , 2016 , 2017 and 2018 , respectively. We anticipate that these amortization amounts will increase in future periods as a result of our acquisition of Prolexic, which closed in February 2014. Restructuring Charges For the Years Ended December 31, For the Years Ended December 31, (in thousands) 2013 2012 % Change 2012 2011 % Change Restructuring charges $ 1,843 $ 406 353.9 % $ 406 $ 4,886 (91.7 )% As a percentage of revenue 0.1 % % % 0.4 % During 2013, we recorded a restructuring charge for leasehold improvements that are no longer in use as a result of an early lease termination. In addition, we incurred severance and relocation expenses for employees impacted by the closing of the facility. In 2012, we recorded restructuring charges related to work force reductions in connection with the 2012 acquisitions of FastSoft and Verivue. In 2011, we implemented a company-wide workforce reduction and vacated excess facilities. As a result, we recorded severance and estimated future lease payments, net of sublease income, in 2011. We do not expect to incur additional restructuring charges as a result of these actions. Interest Income, Net For the Years Ended December 31, For the Years Ended December 31, (in thousands) 2013 2012 % Change 2012 2011 % Change Interest income, net $ 6,077 $ 6,455 (5.9 )% $ 6,455 $ 10,421 (38.1 )% As a percentage of revenue 0.4 % 0.5 % 0.5 % 0.9 % 29 Table of Contents Interest income, net consists of interest earned on invested cash balances and marketable securities. Other (Expense) Income, Net For the Years Ended December 31, For the Years Ended December 31, (in thousands) 2013 2012 % Change 2012 2011 % Change Other (expense) income, net $ (491 ) $ 649 (175.7 )% $ 649 $ 6,125 (89.4 )% As a percentage of revenue % % % 0.5 % Other (expense) income, net primarily represents net foreign exchange gains and losses incurred and other non-operating expense and income items. The fluctuation in other (expense) income, net for 2013 as compared to 2012 , was primarily due to foreign currency exchange rate fluctuations on inter-company and other non-functional currency transactions. The fluctuation in other (expense) income, net for 2012 as compared to 2011, was primarily due to a legal settlement received in 2011. Other (expense) income, net may fluctuate in the future based upon changes in foreign exchange rates or other events. Provision for Income Taxes For the Years Ended December 31, For the Years Ended December 31, (in thousands) 2013 2012 % Change 2012 2011 % Change Provision for income taxes $ 126,067 $ 117,602 7.2 % $ 117,602 $ 106,291 10.6 % As a percentage of revenue 8.0 % 8.6 % 8.6 % 9.2 % Effective income tax rate 30.0 % 36.6 % 36.6 % 34.6 % For the year ended December 31, 2013 , our effective income tax rate was lower than the federal statutory tax rate mainly due to the retroactive adoption of the domestic production activities deduction which resulted in a net tax benefit of $18.3 million for the period from January 1, 2010 through December 31, 2013, the reinstatement of the federal research and development credit at the beginning of 2013 , which included a one-time retroactive impact for 2012 , as well as the composition of income in foreign jurisdictions that is taxed at lower rates compared to the statutory tax rates in the U.S. For the year ended December 31, 2012 our effective income tax rate was higher than the federal statutory tax rate mainly due to the effects of accounting for stock-based compensation in accordance with the authoritative guidance for share-based payments and state income tax expense. For the year ended December 31, 2011 our effective income tax rate was lower than the federal statutory tax rate due primarily to benefits recorded for research and development tax credits and the tax rate differential on foreign earnings, partially offset by state income taxes. The increase in the provision for income taxes for the year ended December 31, 2013 as compared to the same period in 2012 was mainly due to the increase in operating income, partially offset by the domestic production activities deduction, the federal research and development credit and a change in the composition of projected income in different jurisdictions. Our effective income tax rate may fluctuate between fiscal years and from quarter to quarter due to items arising from discrete events, such as tax benefits from the disposition of employee equity awards, settlements of tax audits and assessments and tax law changes. Our effective income tax rate is also impacted by, and may fluctuate in any given period because of, the composition of income in foreign jurisdictions where tax rates differ depending on the local statutory rates. Non-GAAP Financial Measures In addition to providing financial measurements based on generally accepted accounting principles in the United States of America, or GAAP, we publicly discuss additional financial measures that are not prepared in accordance with GAAP, or non-GAAP financial measures. Management uses non-GAAP financial measures, in addition to GAAP financial measures, to understand and compare operating results across accounting periods, for financial and operational decision making, for planning and forecasting purposes and to evaluate our financial performance. These non-GAAP financial measures are non-GAAP net income, non-GAAP net income per diluted share, Adjusted EBITDA and Adjusted EBITDA margin, as discussed below. Management believes that these non-GAAP financial measures reflect our ongoing business in a manner that allows for meaningful comparisons and analysis of trends in our business, as they exclude expenses and gains that may be infrequent, 30 Table of Contents unusual in nature or otherwise not reflective of our ongoing operating results. Management also believes that these non-GAAP financial measures provide useful information to investors in understanding and evaluating our operating results and future prospects in the same manner as management and in comparing financial results across accounting periods and to those of peer companies. The non-GAAP financial measures do not replace the presentation of our GAAP financial results and should only be used as a supplement to, not as a substitute for, our financial results presented in accordance with GAAP. The non-GAAP adjustments, and our basis for excluding them from non-GAAP financial measures, are outlined below: Amortization of acquired intangible assets We have incurred amortization of intangible assets, included in our GAAP financial statements, related to various acquisitions we made. The amount of an acquisition's purchase price allocated to intangible assets and the term of its related amortization can vary significantly and are unique to each acquisition; therefore, we exclude amortization of acquired intangible assets from non-GAAP financial measures to provide investors with a consistent basis for comparing pre- and post-acquisition operating results. Stock-based compensation and amortization of capitalized stock-based compensation Although stock-based compensation is an important aspect of the compensation we pay to our employees and executives, the expense varies with changes in the stock price and market conditions at the time of grant, varying valuation methodologies, subjective assumptions and the variety of award types. This makes the comparison of our current financial results to previous and future periods difficult to interpret; therefore, we believe it is useful to exclude stock-based compensation and amortization of capitalized stock-based compensation from non-GAAP financial measures as one way to better understand the performance of our core business performance and to be consistent with the way the investors evaluate our performance and compare our operating results to those of peer companies. Acquisition-related costs Acquisition-related costs include transaction fees, due diligence costs and other direct costs associated with strategic activities. In addition, subsequent adjustments to our initial estimated amount of contingent consideration associated with specific acquisitions are included within acquisition-related costs. These amounts are impacted by the timing and size of the acquisitions. We exclude acquisition-related costs from non-GAAP financial measures to provide a useful comparison of our operating results to prior periods and to our peer companies because such amounts vary significantly based on the magnitude of our acquisition transactions. Restructuring charges We have incurred restructuring charges which are included in our GAAP financial statements, primarily related to workforce reductions and estimated costs of exiting facility lease commitments. We exclude these items from non-GAAP financial measures when evaluating our continuing business performance as such items are not consistently recurring and do not reflect expected future operating expense nor, in our view, do they provide meaningful insight into the fundamentals of our current or past operations. Gain and other activity related to divestiture of a business We recognized a gain and other activity associated with the divestiture of ADS. We exclude gains and other activity related to divestiture of a business from our non-GAAP financial measures because transactions of this nature occur infrequently and are not considered part of our core business operations. Income tax effect of non-GAAP adjustments The non-GAAP adjustments described above and listed in the table below are reported on a pre-tax basis. The income tax effect of non-GAAP adjustments is the difference between GAAP and non-GAAP income tax expense. Non-GAAP income tax expense is computed on non-GAAP pre-tax income (GAAP pre-tax income adjusted for non-GAAP adjustments) and excludes certain discrete tax items (such as recording or release of valuation allowances), if any. We believe that applying the non-GAAP adjustments and their related income tax effect allows us to more properly reflect the income attributable to our core operations. 31 Table of Contents The following table reconciles GAAP net income to non-GAAP net income and non-GAAP net income per diluted share for the years ended December 31, 2013, 2012 and 2011 (in thousands, except per share data): 2013 2012 2011 Net income $ 293,487 $ 203,989 $ 200,904 Amortization of acquired intangible assets 21,547 20,962 17,070 Stock-based compensation 95,884 90,585 61,305 Amortization of capitalized stock-based compensation 8,077 7,680 7,308 Acquisition-related costs 1,853 5,787 580 Restructuring charges 1,843 406 4,886 Gain and other activity related to divestiture of a business (1,188 ) Legal settlements, net (8,043 ) Loss on investments 500 Income tax effect of above non-GAAP adjustments (54,124 ) (38,061 ) (28,445 ) Total non-GAAP net income $ 367,379 $ 291,348 $ 256,065 GAAP net income per diluted share $ 1.61 $ 1.12 $ 1.07 Non-GAAP net income per diluted share $ 2.02 $ 1.60 $ 1.37 Shares used in per share calculations 181,783 181,749 187,556 We consider Adjusted EBITDA to be another important indicator of the operational strength and performance of our business and a good measure of our historical operating trends. Adjusted EBITDA eliminates items that are either not part of our core operations or do not require a cash outlay. We define Adjusted EBITDA as GAAP net income excluding the following items: interest; income taxes; depreciation and amortization of tangible and intangible assets; stock-based compensation; amortization of capitalized stock-based compensation; restructuring charges; acquisition-related costs; certain gains and losses on investments; gains, losses and other activity related to divestiture of a business; foreign exchange gains and losses; loss on early extinguishment of debt; gains and losses on legal settlements and other non-recurring or unusual items that may arise from time to time. Adjusted EBITDA margin represents Adjusted EBITDA stated as a percentage of revenue. The following table reconciles GAAP net income to Adjusted EBITDA and Adjusted EBITDA margin for the years ended December 31, 2013, 2012 and 2011 (in thousands): 2013 2012 2011 Net income $ 293,487 $ 203,989 $ 200,904 Amortization of acquired intangible assets 21,547 20,962 17,070 Stock-based compensation 95,884 90,585 61,305 Amortization of capitalized stock-based compensation 8,077 7,680 7,308 Acquisition-related costs 1,853 5,787 580 Restructuring charges 1,843 406 4,886 Gain and other activity related to divestiture of a business (1,188 ) Interest income, net (6,077 ) (6,455 ) (10,421 ) Provision for income taxes 126,067 117,602 106,291 Depreciation and amortization 154,807 175,521 143,500 Other expense (income), net 491 (649 ) (6,125 ) Adjusted EBITDA $ 696,791 $ 615,428 $ 525,298 Adjusted EBITDA margin 44 % 45 % 45 % 32 Table of Contents Impact of Foreign Currency Exchange Rates on Revenue Revenue from our international operations has historically represented a significant portion of our total revenue. Consequently, our revenue results have been impacted, and management expects they will continue to be impacted, by fluctuations in foreign currency exchange rates. For example, when the local currencies of our foreign subsidiaries weaken, our consolidated results stated in U.S. dollars are negatively impacted. Because exchange rates are an important factor in understanding period-to-period comparisons, management believes the presentation of the impact of foreign currency exchange rates on revenue enhances the understanding of our revenue results and evaluation of performance in comparison to prior periods. The information presented is calculated by translating current period results using the same average foreign currency exchange rates per month from the comparative period. Liquidity and Capital Resources To date, we have financed our operations primarily through public and private sales of debt and equity securities and cash generated by operations. As of December 31, 2013 , our cash, cash equivalents and marketable securities, which consisted of corporate bonds and U.S. government agency securities, totaled $1.2 billion . We place our cash investments in instruments that meet high quality credit standards, as specified in our investment policy. Our investment policy also limits the amount of our credit exposure to any one issue or issuer and seeks to manage these assets to achieve our goals of preserving principal and maintaining adequate liquidity at all times. Changes in cash, cash equivalents and marketable securities are dependent upon changes in, among other things, working capital items such as deferred revenues, accounts payable, accounts receivable and various accrued expenses, as well as changes in our capital and financial structure due to common stock repurchases, debt repurchases and issuances, stock option exercises, purchases and sales of marketable securities and similar events. We believe our strong balance sheet and cash position are important competitive differentiators that provide the financial flexibility necessary to make the best investments at the most opportune times. We continue to evaluate strategic investments to strengthen our business on an ongoing basis. As of December 31, 2013 , we had cash and cash equivalents of $112.3 million held in accounts outside the U.S. An immaterial amount of these funds would be subject to U.S. federal taxation if repatriated, with such tax liability partially offset by foreign tax credits. The remainder of our cash and cash equivalents held outside the U.S. are subject to, or offset by, inter-company obligations to our parent company in the U.S. and, therefore, are not subject to U.S. federal taxation. As a result, our liquidity is not materially impacted by the amount of cash and cash equivalents held in accounts outside the U.S. Cash Provided by Operating Activities For the Years Ended December 31, (in thousands) 2013 2012 2011 Net income $ 293,487 $ 203,989 $ 200,904 Non-cash reconciling items included in net income 286,033 265,601 272,763 Changes in operating assets and liabilities (15,612 ) 60,430 (27,389 ) Net cash flows provided by operating activities $ 563,908 $ 530,020 $ 446,278 The increase in cash provided by operating activities for the year ended December 31, 2013 as compared to 2012 , was primarily due to increased profitability, and the resulting cash collections from customers, offset by payments to our vendors. The increase in cash provided by operating activities for the year ended December 31, 2012 as compared to 2011 was due to increased profitability and the timing of collections from our customers. We expect cash provided by operating activities to increase in 2014 due to an expected increase in cash collections related to anticipated higher revenues, partially offset by an anticipated increase in operating expenses that require cash outlays such as salaries and commissions. We have revised cash provided by operating activities reported in 2012 and 2011 in the table above to reflect immaterial cash flow classification errors identified in 2013 between operating, investing and financing activities. The same amounts have been revised in the cash used in investing and financing activities tables below. See Note 1 to the consolidated financial statements included elsewhere in this annual report on Form 10-K for additional information and amounts revised. 33 Table of Contents Cash (Used in) Provided by Investing Activities For the Years Ended December 31, (in thousands) 2013 2012 2011 Cash paid for acquired businesses, net of cash acquired $ (30,657 ) $ (336,680 ) $ (550 ) Purchases of property and equipment and capitalization of internal-use software costs (260,073 ) (220,977 ) (176,089 ) Net marketable securities activity (19,750 ) (222,277 ) 354,113 Other investing activity (2,628 ) 824 (124 ) Net cash (used in) provided by investing activities $ (313,108 ) $ (779,110 ) $ 177,350 The decrease in cash used in investing activities for the year ended December 31, 2013 as compared to 2012 , primarily relates to the acquisitions of Blaze, Cotendo, FastSoft and Verivue in 2012 , with no corresponding acquisitions of the same magnitude in 2013 . The decrease also relates to the timing of purchases and sales of marketable securities, offset by an increase in our capital expenditures. The decrease in cash flows from investing activities for the year ended December 31, 2012 as compared to 2011, primarily relates to the acquisitions occurring in 2012 and the timing of purchases and sales of marketable securities in both periods. Cash Used in Financing Activities For the Years Ended December 31, (in thousands) 2013 2012 2011 Activity related to stock-based compensation $ 45,176 $ 33,439 $ 30,032 Repurchases of common stock (160,419 ) (141,468 ) (324,070 ) Net cash used in financing activities $ (115,243 ) $ (108,029 ) $ (294,038 ) The increase in cash used in financing activities during the year ended December 31, 2013 as compared to 2012 , is the result of an increase in repurchases of our common stock, partially offset by an increase in proceeds received from our stock-based compensation plans. The decrease in cash used in financing activities during the year ended December 31, 2012 as compared to 2011, is primarily the result of a decrease in repurchases of our common stock. During the years ended December 31, 2013 , 2012 and 2011, we repurchased 3.9 million , 4.4 million and 12.3 million shares of common stock, respectively, at an average price per share of $41.16 , $32.45 and $26.45, respectively. In April 2012, the Board of Directors authorized a $150.0 million stock repurchase program covering a twelve-month period commencing on May 1, 2012. In January 2013 , the Board of Directors authorized a $150.0 million extension of our share repurchase program, effective for a twelve-month period beginning February 1, 2013 . In October 2013 , the Board of Directors authorized a new $750.0 million share repurchase program, effective from October 16, 2013 through December 31, 2016. Unused amounts from the May 2012 program were not carried over to the program approved in January 2013 , and unused amounts from the January 2013 program were not carried over to the October 2013 program. The goal of the October 2013 share repurchase program is to both offset dilution from our equity compensation plans and to provide the flexibility to increase distributions to our shareholders as business and market conditions warrant. Repurchases under the October 2013 plan will be executed in the open market subject to Rule 10b-18 promulgated under the Exchange Act, and may also be made under one or more Rule 10b5-1 plans, which would permit us to repurchase shares when we might otherwise be precluded from doing so under insider trading laws. Subject to applicable securities laws requirements, we may choose to suspend or discontinue the repurchase program at any time. Any purchases made under the program will be reflected as an increase in cash used in financing activities. Convertible Senior Notes In February 2014, we issued $690.0 million par value of convertible senior notes due 2019 and entered into related convertible note hedge and warrant transactions. The terms of the notes, hedge and warrant transactions are discussed more fully in Note 19 to the consolidated financial statements included elsewhere in this annual report on Form 10-K. Akamai intends to use the net 34 Table of Contents proceeds of the offering for share repurchases, working capital and general corporate purposes, including potential acquisitions and other strategic transactions. In February 2014, we used $62.0 million of the net proceeds from the convertible senior notes to repurchase 1.0 million shares of our common stock in accordance with the stock repurchase plan previously approved by our Board of Directors discussed above. Liquidity Outlook We believe, based on our present business plan, that our current cash, cash equivalents and marketable securities balances, the net proceeds from the convertible senior notes issued in 2014 and our forecasted cash flows from operations will be sufficient to meet our foreseeable cash needs for at least the next 24 months. Our foreseeable cash needs include our planned capital expenditures, salaries related to increased hiring, investments in information technology and facility expansion costs, in addition to anticipated share repurchases, lease and purchase commitments, settlements of other long-term liabilities and the Prolexic acquisition. Contractual Obligations, Contingent Liabilities and Commercial Commitments The following table presents our contractual obligations and commercial commitments, as of December 31, 2013 , for the next five years and thereafter (in thousands): Payments Due by Period Total Less than 12 Months 12 to 36 Months 36 to 60 Months More than 60 Months Real estate operating leases $ 192,330 $ 31,583 $ 60,426 $ 52,606 $ 47,715 Bandwidth and co-location agreements 116,195 103,626 11,032 1,514 23 Open vendor purchase orders 71,753 65,267 6,486 Total contractual obligations $ 380,278 $ 200,476 $ 77,944 $ 54,120 $ 47,738 In accordance with the authoritative guidance for accounting for uncertainty in income taxes, as of December 31, 2013 , we had unrecognized tax benefits of $ 30.6 million , which included $ 5.9 million of accrued interest and penalties. As of December 31, 2013 , we believe that it is reasonably possible that approximately $3.2 million of our unrecognized tax benefits, each of which are individually insignificant and include research and development credits and transfer pricing adjustments, may be recognized by the end of 2014 as a result of ongoing audits. Letters of Credit As of December 31, 2013 , we had outstanding $6.8 million in irrevocable letters of credit issued by us in favor of third party beneficiaries, primarily related to facility leases. These irrevocable letters of credit, which are not included in the table of contractual obligations and commercial commitments above, are unsecured and are expected to remain in effect until December 2019. Off-Balance Sheet Arrangements We have entered into various indemnification arrangements with third parties, including vendors, customers, landlords, our officers and directors, shareholders of acquired companies and third party licensees of our technology. Generally, these indemnification agreements require us to reimburse losses suffered by third parties due to various events, such as lawsuits arising from patent or copyright infringement or our negligence. These indemnification obligations are considered off-balance sheet arrangements in accordance with the authoritative guidance for guarantor accounting and disclosure requirements for guarantees, including indirect guarantees of indebtedness of others. To date, we have not encountered material costs as a result of such obligations and have not accrued any significant liabilities related to such indemnification obligations in our financial statements. See Note 9 to our consolidated financial statements included elsewhere in this annual report on Form 10-K for further discussion of these indemnification agreements. 35 Table of Contents Litigation We are party to litigation that we consider routine and incidental to our business. Management does not currently expect the results of any of these litigation matters to have a material effect on our business, results of operations, financial condition or cash flows. Recent Accounting Pronouncements In February 2013, the Financial Accounting Standards Board issued guidance and disclosure requirements for reporting of comprehensive income: amounts reclassified out of accumulated other comprehensive income. The guidance requires that an entity provide information about the amounts reclassified out of accumulated other comprehensive income by component. In addition, an entity is required to present, either on the face of the statement where net income is presented or in the notes thereto, significant amounts reclassified out of accumulated other comprehensive income by the respective line items of net income but only if the amount reclassified is required under GAAP. The guidance is effective for fiscal years, and interim periods within those years, beginning on or after December 15, 2012. The adoption of this guidance in the first quarter of 2013 did not have a material impact on our consolidated financial results. Application of Critical Accounting Policies and Estimates Overview Our MD&A is based upon our consolidated financial statements, which have been prepared in accordance with GAAP. These principles require us to make estimates and judgments that affect the reported amounts of assets, liabilities, revenue and expenses, cash flow and related disclosure of contingent assets and liabilities. Our estimates include those related to revenue recognition, accounts receivable and related reserves, valuation and impairment of marketable securities, capitalized internal-use software development costs, goodwill and acquired intangible assets, income tax reserves, impairment and useful lives of long-lived assets and stock-based compensation. We base our estimates on historical experience and on various other assumptions that we believe to be reasonable under the circumstances at the time such estimates are made. Actual results may differ from these estimates. For a complete description of our significant accounting policies, see Note 2 to our consolidated financial statements included elsewhere in this annual report on Form 10-K. Definitions We define our critical accounting policies as those policies that require us to make subjective estimates and judgments about matters that are uncertain and are likely to have a material impact on our consolidated financial statements. Our estimates are based upon assumptions and judgments about matters that are highly uncertain at the time the accounting estimate is made and applied and require us to assess a range of potential outcomes. Review of Critical Accounting Policies and Estimates Revenue Recognition Revenue is recognized only when the price is fixed or determinable, persuasive evidence of an arrangement exists, the service is performed and collectability of the resulting receivable is reasonably assured. We primarily derive revenues from the sale of services to customers executing contracts with terms of one year or longer. These contracts generally commit the customer to a minimum of monthly, quarterly or annual level of usage and specify the rate at which the customer must pay for actual usage above the monthly, quarterly or annual minimum. For contracts with a monthly committment, we recognize the monthly minimum as revenue each month, provided that an enforceable contract has been signed by both parties, the service has been delivered to the customer, the fee for the service is fixed or determinable and collection is reasonably assured. Should a customer usage of our service exceed the monthly minimum, we recognize revenue for such excess usage in the period of the additional usage. For annual or other non-monthly period revenue commitments, we recognize revenue monthly based upon the customer actual usage each month of the commitment period and only recognize any remaining committed amount for the applicable period in the last month thereof. We typically charge customers an integration fee when the services are first activated. The integration fees are recorded as deferred revenue and recognized as revenue ratably over the estimated life of the customer arrangement. We also derive revenue from services sold as discrete, non-recurring events or based solely on usage. For these services, we recognize revenue once the event or usage has occurred. 36 Table of Contents When more than one element is contained in a revenue arrangement, we determine the fair value for each element in the arrangement based on vendor-specific objective evidence, or VSOE, for each respective element, including any renewal rates for services contractually offered to the customer. Elements typically included in our multiple element arrangements consist of our core services the delivery of content, applications and software over the Internet as well as mobile and security solutions and enterprise professional services. These elements have value to our customers on a stand-alone basis in that they can be sold separately by another vendor. Generally, there is no right of return relative to these services. We typically use VSOE to determine the fair value of our separate elements. All stand-alone sales of professional services are reviewed to establish the average stand-alone selling price for those services. For our core services, the fair value is the price charged for a single deliverable on a per unit basis when it is sold separately. For arrangements in which we are unable to establish VSOE, third party evidence, or TPE, of the fair value of each element is determined based upon the price charged when the element is sold separately by another vendor. For arrangements in which we are unable to establish VSOE or TPE for each element, we use the best estimate of selling price, or BESP, to determine the fair value of the separate deliverables. We estimate BESP based upon a management-approved price list and pre-established discount levels for each solution that takes into consideration volume, geography and industry lines. We allocate arrangement consideration across the multiple elements using the relative selling price method. At the inception of a customer contract, we make an estimate as to that customer ability to pay for the services provided. We base our estimate on a combination of factors, including the successful completion of a credit check or financial review, our collection experience with the customer and other forms of payment assurance. Upon the completion of these steps, we recognize revenue monthly in accordance with our revenue recognition policy. If we subsequently determine that collection from the customer is not reasonably assured, we record an allowance for doubtful accounts and bad debt expense for all of that customer unpaid invoices and cease recognizing revenue for continued services provided until cash is received from the customer. Changes in our estimates and judgments about whether collection is reasonably assured would change the timing of revenue or amount of bad debt expense that we recognize. We also sell our services through a reseller channel. Assuming all other revenue recognition criteria are met, we recognize revenue from reseller arrangements based on the reseller contracted non-refundable minimum purchase commitments over the term of the contract, plus amounts sold by the reseller to its customers in excess of the minimum commitments. Amounts attributable to this excess usage are recognized as revenue in the period in which the service is provided. From time to time, we enter into contracts to sell our services or license our technology to unrelated enterprises at or about the same time we enter into contracts to purchase products or services from the same enterprises. If we conclude that these contracts were negotiated concurrently, we record as revenue only the net cash received from the vendor, unless the product or service received has a separate and identifiable benefit and the fair value to us of the vendor product or service can be objectively established. We may from time to time resell licenses or services of third parties. We record revenue for these transactions on a gross basis when we have risk of loss related to the amounts purchased from the third party and we add value to the license or service, such as by providing maintenance or support for such license or service. If these conditions are present, we recognize revenue when all other revenue recognition criteria are satisfied. Deferred revenue represents amounts billed to customers for which revenue has not been recognized. Deferred revenue primarily consists of the unearned portion of monthly billed service fees, prepayments made by customers for future periods, deferred integration and activation set-up fees and amounts billed under customer arrangements with extended payment terms. Accounts Receivable and Related Reserves Trade accounts receivable are recorded at the invoiced amounts and do not bear interest. In addition to trade accounts receivable, our accounts receivable balance includes unbilled accounts that represent revenue recorded for customers that is typically billed within one month. We record reserves against our accounts receivable balance. These reserves consist of allowances for doubtful accounts and revenue from certain customers on a cash-basis. Increases and decreases in the allowance for doubtful accounts are included as a component of general and administrative expense in the consolidated statements of operations. Increases in the reserve for cash-basis customers are recorded as reduction of revenue. The reserve for cash-basis customers increases as services are provided to customers for which collection is no longer reasonably assured. The reserve decreases and revenue is recognized when and if cash payments are received. 37 Table of Contents Estimates are used in determining these reserves and are based upon our review of outstanding balances on a customer-specific, account-by-account basis. The allowance for doubtful accounts is based upon a review of customer receivables from prior sales with collection issues where we no longer believe that the customer has the ability to pay for prior services provided. We perform ongoing credit evaluations of our customers. If such an evaluation indicates that payment is no longer reasonably assured for services provided, any future services provided to that customer will result in creation of a cash basis reserve until we receive consistent payments. Valuation and Impairment of Marketable Securities We measure the fair value of our financial assets and liabilities at the end of each reporting period. Fair value is defined as the exchange price that would be received for an asset or paid to transfer a liability (an exit price) in the principal or most advantageous market for the asset or liability in an orderly transaction between market participants on the measurement date. We have certain financial assets and liabilities recorded at fair value (principally cash equivalents and short- and long-term marketable securities) that have been classified as Level 1, 2 or 3 within the fair value hierarchy. Fair values determined by Level 1 inputs utilize quoted prices (unadjusted) in active markets for identical assets or liabilities that the Company can access at the reporting date. Fair values determined by Level 2 inputs utilize data points other than quoted prices included within Level 1 that are observable for the asset or liability, either directly or indirectly. Fair values determined by Level 3 inputs are based on unobservable data points for the asset or liability. Marketable securities are considered to be impaired when a decline in fair value below cost basis is determined to be other-than-temporary. We periodically evaluate whether a decline in fair value below cost basis is other-than-temporary by considering available evidence regarding these investments including, among other factors, the duration of the period that, and extent to which, the fair value is less than cost basis, the financial health of and business outlook for the issuer, including industry and sector performance and operational and financing cash flow factors, overall market conditions and trends and our intent and ability to retain our investment in the security for a period of time sufficient to allow for an anticipated recovery in market value. Once a decline in fair value is determined to be other-than-temporary, a write-down is recorded and a new cost basis in the security is established. Assessing the above factors involves inherent uncertainty. Write-downs, if recorded, could be materially different from the actual market performance of marketable securities in our portfolio if, among other things, relevant information related to our investments and marketable securities was not publicly available or other factors not considered by us would have been relevant to the determination of impairment. Impairment and Useful Lives of Long-Lived Assets We review our long-lived assets, such as property and equipment and acquired intangible assets, for impairment whenever events or changes in circumstances indicate that the carrying amount of the assets may not be recoverable. Events that would trigger an impairment review include a change in the use of the asset or forecasted negative cash flows related to the asset. When such events occur, we compare the carrying amount of the asset to the undiscounted expected future cash flows related to the asset. If this comparison indicates that impairment is present, the amount of the impairment is calculated as the difference between the carrying amount and the fair value of the asset. If a readily determinable market price does not exist, fair value is estimated using discounted expected cash flows attributable to the asset. The estimates required to apply this accounting policy include forecasted usage of the long-lived assets, the useful lives of these assets and expected future cash flows. Changes in these estimates could materially impact results from operations. Effective January 1, 2013, we increased the expected average useful lives of our network assets, primarily servers, from three to four years to reflect software and hardware related initiatives to manage our global network more efficiently. This change was recorded prospectively and decreased depreciation expense on network assets by approximately $45.7 million and increased net income by approximately $33.6 million for the year ended December 31, 2013 . The change also increased basic and diluted net income per share by $0.19 and $0.18, respectively, for the year ended December 31, 2013 . Goodwill and Acquired Intangible Assets We test goodwill for impairment on an annual basis, as of December 31, or more frequently if events or changes in circumstances indicate that the asset might be impaired. We have concluded that we have one reporting unit and that our chief operating decision maker is our chief executive officer and the executive management team. We have assigned the entire balance of goodwill to our one reporting unit. The fair value of the reporting unit was based on our market capitalization as of each of December 31, 2013 and 2012 , and it was substantially in excess of the carrying value of the reporting unit at each date. Acquired intangible assets consist of completed technologies, customer relationships, trademarks and trade names, and non-compete agreements arising from acquisitions of businesses and acquired license rights. We engaged third party valuation 38 Table of Contents specialists to assist us with the initial measurement of the fair value of acquired intangible assets. Acquired intangible assets, other than goodwill, are amortized over their estimated useful lives based upon the estimated economic value derived from the related intangible assets. Income Taxes Our provision for income taxes is comprised of a current and a deferred portion. The current income tax provision is calculated as the estimated taxes payable or refundable on tax returns for the current year. The deferred income tax provision is calculated for the estimated future tax effects attributable to temporary differences and carryforwards by using expected tax rates in effect in the years during which the differences are expected to reverse or the carryforwards are expected to be realized. We currently have net deferred tax assets, comprised of net operating loss, or NOL, carryforwards, tax credit carryforwards and deductible temporary differences. Our management periodically weighs the positive and negative evidence to determine if it is more likely than not that some or all of the deferred tax assets will be realized. In determining our net deferred tax assets and valuation allowances, annualized effective tax rates and cash paid for income taxes, management is required to make judgments and estimates about domestic and foreign profitability, the timing and extent of the utilization of net operating loss carryforwards, applicable tax rates, transfer pricing methodologies and tax planning strategies. Judgments and estimates related to our projections and assumptions are inherently uncertain; therefore, actual results could differ materially from our projections. We have recorded certain tax reserves to address potential exposures involving our income tax positions. These potential tax liabilities result from the varying application of statutes, rules, regulations and interpretations by different taxing jurisdictions. Our estimate of the value of our tax reserves contains assumptions based on past experiences and judgments about the interpretation of statutes, rules and regulations by taxing jurisdictions. It is possible that the costs of the ultimate tax liability or benefit from these matters may be materially more or less than the amount that we estimated. Uncertainty in income taxes is recognized in our financial statements under guidance that prescribes a two-step process to determine the amount of tax benefit to be recognized. First, the tax position must be evaluated to determine the likelihood that it will be sustained upon external examination. If the tax position is deemed more-likely-than-not to be sustained, the tax position is then assessed to determine the amount of benefit to recognize in the financial statements. The amount of the benefit that may be recognized is the largest amount that has a greater than 50 percent likelihood of being realized upon ultimate settlement. Accounting for Stock-Based Compensation We issue stock-based compensation awards including stock options, restricted stock units and deferred stock units. We measure the fair value of these awards at the grant date and recognize such fair value as expense over the vesting period. We have selected the Black-Scholes option pricing model to determine the fair value of stock option awards. Determining the fair value of stock-based awards at the grant date requires judgment, including estimating the expected life of the stock awards and the volatility of the underlying common stock. Our assumptions may differ from those used in prior periods. Changes to the assumptions may have a significant impact on the fair value of stock-based awards, which could have a material impact on our financial statements. Judgment is also required in estimating the amount of stock-based awards that are expected to be forfeited. Should our actual forfeiture rates differ significantly from our estimates, our stock-based compensation expense and results of operations could be materially impacted. In addition, for awards that vest and become exercisable only upon achievement of specified performance conditions, we make judgments and estimates each quarter about the probability that such performance conditions will be met or achieved. Changes to the estimates we make from time to time may have a significant impact on our stock-based compensation expense recorded and could materially impact our result of operations. For stock options, restricted stock units and deferred stock units that contain only a service-based vesting feature, we recognize compensation cost on a straight-line basis over the awards' vesting period. For awards with a performance condition-based vesting feature, we recognize compensation cost on a graded-vesting basis over the awards expected vesting period, commencing when achievement of the performance condition is deemed probable. Capitalized Internal-Use Software Costs We capitalize salaries and related costs, as well as stock-based compensation expense, of employees and consultants who devote time to the development of internal-use software development projects. Capitalization begins during the application development stage, once the preliminary project stage has been completed. If a project constitutes an enhancement to previously-developed software, we assess whether the enhancement is significant and creates additional functionality to the 39 Table of Contents software, thus qualifying the work incurred for capitalization. Once the project is available for general release, capitalization ceases and we estimate the useful life of the asset and begin amortization. We periodically assess whether triggering events are present to review internal-use software for impairment. Changes in our estimates related to internal-use software would increase or decrease operating expenses or amortization recorded during the period.
