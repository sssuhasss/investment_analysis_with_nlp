ITEM 7. MANAGEMENT S DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS OF FINANCIAL CONDITION AND RESULTS OF OPERATIONS The following discussion should be read in conjunction with our consolidated financial statements and notes thereto appearing elsewhere in this annual report on Form 10-K. Forward-looking statements involve inherent risks and uncertainties regarding events, conditions, and financial trends that may affect our future plans of operation, business strategy, results of operations, and financial position. A number of important factors could cause actual results to differ materially from those included within or contemplated by such forward-looking statements, including, but not limited to, those described under Item 1A. Risk Factors in this annual report on Form 10-K. We do not undertake any responsibility to update any of these factors or to announce publicly any revisions to any of the forward-looking statements contained in this or any other document, whether as a result of new information, future event s, or otherwise. As used in this report, references to the Company, we, our, and us refer to Alexandria Real Estate Equities, Inc. and its subsidiaries. Overview We are a Maryland corporation formed in October 1994 that has elected to be taxed as a REIT for federal income tax purposes. We are a self-administered and self-managed REIT, and the largest and leading REIT focused principally on owning, operating, developing, redeveloping, and acquiring high-quality, sustainable real estate for the broad and diverse life science industry. As of December 31, 2013 , our asset base consisted of 30.9 million square feet, including 17.5 million RSF of operating and current value-creation development/redevelopment assets, as well as land supporting an additional 13.4 million square feet of ground-up development projects. We were founded by Jerry M. Sudarsky and Joel S. Marcus in 1994. We pioneered the laboratory/office niche and have become the leading life science real estate brand and dominant market presence in the top life science clusters, including Greater Boston, the San Francisco Bay Area, San Diego, Greater New York City, Maryland, Seattle, and Research Triangle Park. We manage our properties through fully integrated regional and life science teams with unparalleled real estate and life science expertise. As the Landlord of Choice to the Life Science Industry , we are known for our high-quality and diverse client tenant base, which includes renowned academic and medical institutions, multinational pharmaceutical companies, public and private biotechnology entities, United States government research agencies, medical device companies, industrial biotech companies, venture capital firms, and life science product and service companies. We have a proven and superior track record developing Class A laboratory/office assets focused primarily in key urban science center campus locations in AAA cluster locations adjacent to leading academic medical research centers, offering highly creative amenities that drive client tenant productivity and foster innovation, and cultivating our longstanding and expansive network in the life science community. We believe these advantages result in higher occupancy levels, longer lease terms, higher rental income, higher returns, and greater long-term asset value. Our average occupancy rate of operating properties as of December 31 of each year from 2000 to 2013 was approximately 94.9% . Our average occupancy rate of operating and redevelopment properties as of December 31 of each year from 2000 to 2013 was approximately 89.1% . Investment-grade client tenants represented 51% of our total ABR as of December 31, 2013. Executive Summary Our per share results for the year ended December 31, 2013, reflected (i) the strength of our core operations, (ii) completion of significant high-value Class A development projects in AAA locations in urban science and technology cluster markets, and (iii) the completion of many significant and important improvements in our long-term capital structure. Monetization of significant non-income-producing land parcels (Alexandria Center for Science and Technology, located in Mission Bay, Alexandria Center at Kendall Square, located in Cambridge, and Alexandria Center for Life Science - New York City) through lease-up and development, and through selective sales, has generated significant long-term asset value. In 2012 and 2013, we sold certain non-strategic income-producing assets and land for approximately $275 million. Proceeds from these sales, including $55 million from the sale of a land parcel in late 2013, were invested into high-value Class A development projects with an estimated projected value of approximately $450 million, representing a projected increase of almost $175 million above the value of the properties sold. We are also pleased with the successful execution of our second 10-year unsecured bond offering in early 2013 at a rate of 3.90%. The capital generated from the sales of properties and issuance of long-term debt and common stock improved our long-term capital structure, and funded our Class A developments, among others, at Alexandria Center at Kendall Square located in Cambridge, but resulted in short-term per share dilution. We are optimistic about our ability to deliver solid and stable per share earnings growth and continue to increase long-term asset value in 2014 and beyond. 50 The equity capital market for the year ended December 31, 2013, was extremely strong for biotech and pharmaceutical companies, with 46 U.S. biotech companies pricing initial public offerings, the most in over 13 years. More important to us, these companies have continued the strong focus of performing mission-critical research in key intellectual centers where we own laboratory/office facilities, and we benefited greatly by that trend. Our same property NOI growth for the year ended December 31, 2013 , was solid, up $17.3 million , or 5.4% , on a cash basis, and up $6.0 million , or 1.8% , on a GAAP basis compared to the year ended December 31, 2012 . Our cash basis performance for 2013 was driven primarily by our favorable lease structure. As of December 31, 2013 , 95% of our existing leases contained annual contractual steps in rent, and 94% of our leases were triple net, wherein tenants reimburse us for all or a majority of the operating expenses of the property. Our same property performance also benefited from strong leasing performance in 2013 , with increases on average in rental rates upon renewal or re-leasing of space and an increase in overall occupancy percentage. Our non-same property NOI growth for the year ended December 31, 2013 , was also very strong, up $34.4 million , or 55.8% , compared to the year ended December 31, 2012 . Our non-same property performance for 2013 was driven primarily by our key value-creation project deliveries and lease-up of temporary vacant space. We delivered a significant portion of our value - creation pipeline during the year with a major milestone in December, including, among others, the initial delivery of 45% of our second Class A laboratory/office building in New York City to Roche and New York University, among others, and the delivery in September 2013 of our 305,212 RSF development project at 225 Binney Street in the Cambridge submarket of Greater Boston that was 100% leased to Biogen Idec. Our leasing activity reached a new record level with a total of 212 leases aggregating 3.6 million RSF executed in 2013 . Our rental rates increased 4.0% and 16.2% on a cash and GAAP basis, respectively, on renewed/re-leased space during 2013 . The occupancy percentage for our operating and redevelopment properties in North America increased by 390 basis points to 95.5% at December 31, 2013 , compared to 91.6% at December 31, 2012 . In December 2013, we completed the sale of our final land parcel in the Mission Bay submarket of the San Francisco Bay Area at 1600 Owens Street, along with certain parking spaces, for an aggregate sales price of $55.2 million . The delivery of completed development and redevelopment projects, combined with the sale of land parcels in 2013, allowed us to decrease our non-income-producing assets (CIP and land) as a percentage of gross investments in real estate by 600 basis points during the year ended December 31, 2013. We achieved many of the long-term components of our capital strategy in 2013, including a net debt to adjusted EBITDA ratio of 6.6 times and a fixed charge coverage ratio of 3.2 times for the fourth quarter of 2013 on an annualized basis; completed the successful offering of $500 million of 10-year unsecured senior notes at 3.90% ( 3.90% Unsecured Senior Notes ); reduced our non-income-producing assets as a percentage of gross investments in real estate to 17% as of December 31, 2013, compared to 23% as of December 31, 2012, due to the deliveries of value-creation development and redevelopment projects and land sales. For additional information, see Execution of Capital Strategy in 2013 below. Results Core operations Total revenues were $ 631.2 million for the year ended December 31, 2013 , up 9.9% , compared to $ 574.5 million for the year ended December 31, 2012 ; 51% of total ABR from investment-grade client tenants; NOI was $ 442.1 million for the year ended December 31, 2013 , up 10.0% , compared to $ 401.7 million for the year ended December 31, 2012 , driven by our value-creation project deliveries, same property NOI growth, and leasing activity described below; Operating margins were 70% for the year ended December 31, 2013 ; Cash and GAAP same property NOI increased 5.4% and 1.8% , respectively, for the year ended December 31, 2013 , compared to the year ended December 31, 2012 ; and Our same property performance and operating margins remained solid, primarily due to the strong occupancy percentage of our asset base, record leasing activity, and our favorable lease structure, as detailed below. 51 The following table presents information regarding our asset base and value-creation projects as of December 31, 2013, 2012, and 2011 : December 31, (Rentable square feet) 2013 2012 2011 Operating properties 15,534,238 15,435,147 14,065,172 Development properties 1,826,919 1,566,774 818,020 Redevelopment properties 99,873 547,092 919,857 RSF of total properties 17,461,030 17,549,013 15,803,049 Number of properties 180 179 174 Occupancy operating 94.4 % 93.4 % 94.9 % Occupancy operating and redevelopment 93.8 % 89.8 % 88.5 % ABR per leased RSF $ 35.90 $ 34.59 $ 34.39 Leasing activity Leasing activity for the year ended December 31, 2013 , represented the highest level in the Company history: Executed a total of 212 leases, with a weighted average lease term of 7.6 years , for 3,645,056 RSF, including 1,174,306 RSF related to our development or redevelopment programs; Achieved rental rate increases for renewed/re-leased space of 4.0% on a cash basis and 16.2% on a GAAP basis; and Increased the occupancy rate for operating and redevelopment properties in North America by 390 basis points to 95.5% during the year ended December 31, 2013 . Approximately 57% of the 212 leases executed during the year ended December 31, 2013 , did not include concessions for free rent; tenant concessions/free rent averaged approximately 2.5 months, with respect to the 3,645,056 RSF leased during the year ended December 31, 2013 . The following chart presents renewed/re-leased space and development/redevelopment/previously vacant space leased for the years ended December 31, 2011 , 2012 , and 2013: 52 Lease structure Our cash same property NOI increase for the year ended December 31, 2013 , of 5.4% and operating margin of 70% benefited significantly from our favorable lease structure. As of December 31, 2013 , approximately 94% of our leases (on an RSF basis) were triple net leases, requiring client tenants to pay substantially all real estate taxes, insurance, utilities, common area expenses, and other operating expenses (including increases thereto) in addition to base rent. Additionally, approximately 95% of our leases (on an RSF basis) contained effective annual rent escalations that were either fixed or indexed based on a consumer price index or another index, and approximately 92% of our leases (on an RSF basis) provided for the recapture of certain capital expenditures.

We intend to convert the existing space through redevelopment when the spaces become available. Initial stabilized yields and average cash yield will be provided upon commencement of the redevelopment. (2) The buildings are currently undergoing redevelopment, see development and redevelopment table above. On January 30, 2014, we acquired 3545 Cray Court, a 116,556 RSF laboratory/office property located in the Torrey Pines submarket of San Diego, for a total purchase price of $64.0 million. The property is currently 100% occupied by The Scripps Research Institute. The estimated initial stabilized yields for this property are 7.0% and 7.2%, on a cash and GAAP basis, respectively. In connection with the acquisition, we assumed a $40.7 million non-recourse secured note payable with a contractual interest rate of 4.66% and a maturity date of January 2023. Dispositions During the year ended December 31, 2013 , we sold seven income-producing assets for an aggregate sales price of $128.6 million , aggregating 826,824 RSF located primarily in the suburban markets of Seattle, Maryland, Greater New York City, and Greater Boston. In addition, we completed the sale of four parcels of land for an aggregate sales price of $73.3 million , which included the sale of our final land parcel in the Mission Bay submarket of the San Francisco Bay Area, at 1600 Owens Street, for an aggregate sales price of $55.2 million . 54 Balance sheet Over the past several years, we successfully completed important steps in order to improve our long-term capital structure and our credit profile. We have a solid balance sheet that will allow us to deliver stable growth in per share earnings and net asset value. We expect to continue the transition of our balance sheet debt from short-term and medium-term bank debt to long-term unsecured fixed-rate debt over the next several years. However, some bank debt will remain a component of our long-term capital structure, primarily consisting of an unsecured senior line of credit for liquidity and flexibility, and if appropriate, unsecured senior bank term loans. The transition from unhedged variable-rate bank debt to longer-term fixed-rate debt is expected to result in an increase in our interest costs. Growth in earnings from core operations and completion of Class A development projects is expected to generate growth in per share earnings and FFO, even after consideration of projected increases in interest expense related to refinancing outstanding variable-rate bank debt. Our capital structure will also continue to benefit from longer and laddered debt maturities, less LIBOR-based variable interest rate risk, and continued access to diverse sources of capital. While this transition from unhedged variable-rate bank debt is in process, we expect to utilize interest rate swap agreements to reduce our interest rate risk. We expect to keep our unhedged variable-rate debt at approximately 30% or less of our total debt over the short to medium term. The transition of unhedged variable-rate bank debt to longer-term fixed-rate unsecured bonds is not expected to impact the highly effective designation of the existing interest rate swap agreements as of December 31, 2013 . Our forecasts assume outstanding unhedged variable-rate debt in an amount at least equal to our effective notional amount of interest rate swap agreements in effect at any point in time. Secured mortgage notes payable will remain a small portion of our capital structure, and we may utilize secured construction loans for our value-creation development projects from time to time. We believe perpetual preferred stock should remain as a component of our long-term capital structure. As of December 31, 2013 , we had four properties held for sale with an aggregate net book value of $7.5 million . We may identify additional properties for potential sale in 2014 and thereafter. As of December 31, 2013 , approximately 17% of our gross real estate represented non-income-producing assets (CIP and land). Our current development and redevelopment projects represented 8% of our gross investments in real estate, a significant amount of which is pre-leased and expected to be delivered over the next two to eight quarters. The completion and delivery of these projects will significantly reduce our non-income-producing assets as a percentage of gross investments in real estate. Over the next few years, we may also identify certain land parcels for potential sale. Our medium-term target is to reduce non-income-producing assets (CIP and land) as a percentage of our gross investments in real estate to 10%. The chart below shows the historical trend of non-income-producing assets as a percentage of our gross investments in real estate: 55 Execution of capital strategy in 2013 During 2013, we achieved many of the long-term components of our capital strategy intended to provide a solid and flexible capital structure that enables stable and consistent future growth, highlighted by the following key accomplishments: Improved our key credit metric ratios forecasted, including net debt to adjusted EBITDA ratio of 6.6 times and a fixed charge coverage ratio of 3.2 times for the fourth quarter of 2013 on an annualized basis; Reduced our non-income-producing assets (CIP and land) to 17% of our gross investment in real estate as of December 31, 2013, compared to 23% as of December 31, 2012, due to the deliveries of value-creation development and redevelopment projects and completed land sales; Reduced our variable-rate bank debt by approximately $612 million; Completed the successful offering of $500 million of 10-year unsecured senior notes at 3.90%; extended average remaining term of outstanding debt to 5.3 years; Completed a $536 million common stock equity offering at $73.50 per share; Maintained significant liquidity of approximately $1.65 billion, consisting of $1.30 billion available under our unsecured senior line of credit, $295 million available under our construction loan commitments, and $58 million in cash and cash equivalents as of December 31, 2013; Extended the maturity of a $76 million secured note payable from April 2014 to January 2017; and Executed additional interest rate swap agreements to provide a minimum of hedged variable-rate debt of $750 million in 2014 and $500 million in both 2015 and 2016. Results of operations As a result of changes within our total property portfolio, the financial data presented in the table in Comparison of the Year Ended December 31, 2013 , to the Year Ended December 31, 2012 shows significant changes in revenue and expenses from period to period. In order to supplement an evaluation of our results of operations, we analyze the operating performance for all properties that were fully operating for the entire periods presented ( Same Properties ) separate from properties acquired subsequent to the beginning of the earliest period presented, properties currently undergoing development or redevelopment, and corporate entities (legal entities performing general and administrative functions), which are excluded from Same Property results ( Non-Same Properties ). Additionally, rental revenues from lease termination fees, if any, are excluded from the results of the Same Properties. The following table presents information regarding our Same Properties as of December 31, 2013 and 2012 : December 31, 2013 2012 Percentage change in NOI over comparable period from prior year cash basis 5.4% 3.3 % Percentage change in NOI over comparable period from prior year GAAP basis 1.8% (0.6 %) Operating margin 68% 70% Number of Same Properties 133 131 RSF 11,781,883 9,581,079 Occupancy current period 93.5% 93.9% Occupancy same period prior year 92.7% 93.7% 56 The following table reconciles Same Properties to total properties for the year ended December 31, 2013 : Development current Properties Redevelopment current Properties Properties 499 Illinois Street 1 11055/11065/11075 Roselle Street 3 Development/redevelopment - Asia 7 269 East Grand Avenue 1 430 East 29th Street 1 Redevelopment deliveries since January 1, 2012 Acquisitions in North America since January 1, 2012 75/125 Binney Street 1 Properties 360 Longwood Avenue (unconsolidated JV) 1 6275 Nancy Ridge Drive 1 6 Davis Drive 1 4757 Nexus Center Drive 1 407 Davis Drive 1 5 11119 North Torrey Pines Road 1 150 Second Street 1 Development deliveries since January 1, 2012 620 Professional Drive 1 10121/10151 Barnes Canyon Road 2 Properties 20 Walkup Drive 1 259 East Grand Avenue 1 10300 Campus Point Drive 1 Properties held for sale 4 400/450 East Jamie Court 2 343 Oyster Point Boulevard 1 Total properties excluded from Same Properties 47 5200 Illumina Way 1 1616 Eastlake Avenue 1 4755 Nexus Center Drive 1 1551 Eastlake Avenue 1 225 Binney Street 1 9800 Medical Center Drive 3 Same Properties 133 Canada 1 285 Bear Hill Road 1 7 400 Technology Square 1 Total properties as of December 31, 2013 180 3530/3550 John Hopkins Court 2 16 NOI is a non-GAAP financial measure equal to income from continuing operations, the most directly comparable GAAP financial measure, before loss (gain) on early extinguishment of debt, impairment of land parcel, depreciation and amortization, interest expense, and general and administrative expense. We believe NOI provides useful information to investors regarding our financial condition and results of operations because it primarily reflects those income and expense items that are incurred at the property level. Therefore, we believe NOI is a useful measure for evaluating the operating performance of our real estate assets. NOI on a cash basis is NOI on a GAAP basis, adjusted to exclude the effect of straight-line rent adjustments required by GAAP. We believe that NOI on a cash basis is helpful to investors as an additional measure of operating performance because it eliminates straight-line rent adjustments to rental revenue. The chart below shows our NOI for the years ended December 31, 2011, through December 31, 2013 (in millions): 57 Further, we believe NOI is useful to investors as a performance measure, because when compared across periods, NOI reflects the impact on operations from trends in occupancy rates, rental rates, and operating costs, providing perspective not immediately apparent from income from continuing operations. NOI excludes certain components from income from continuing operations in order to provide results that are more closely related to the results of operations of our properties. For example, interest expense is not necessarily linked to the operating performance of a real estate asset and is often incurred at the corporate level rather than at the property level. In addition, depreciation and amortization, because of historical cost accounting and useful life estimates, may distort operating performance at the property level. Real estate impairments have been excluded in deriving NOI because we do not consider impairment losses to be property-level operating expenses. Real estate impairment losses relate to changes in the values of our assets and do not reflect the current operating performance with respect to related revenues or expenses. Our real estate impairments represent the write-down in the value of the assets to the estimated fair value less cost to sell. These impairments result from investing decisions and the deterioration in market conditions that adversely impact underlying real estate values. Our calculation of NOI also excludes charges incurred from changes in certain financing decisions, such as losses on early extinguishment of debt, as these charges often relate to the timing of corporate strategy. Property operating expenses that are included in determining NOI consist of costs that are related to our operating properties, such as utilities; repairs and maintenance; rental expense related to ground leases; contracted services, such as janitorial, engineering, and landscaping; property taxes and insurance; and property-level salaries. General and administrative expenses consist primarily of accounting and corporate compensation, corporate insurance, professional fees, office rent, and office supplies that are incurred as part of corporate office management, and are excluded from NOI because they represent the ownership structure we have, and are not necessarily linked to the operating performance of our properties. NOI presented by us may not be comparable to NOI reported by other equity REITs that define NOI differently. We believe that in order to facilitate a clear understanding of our operating results, NOI should be examined in conjunction with income from continuing operations as presented in our consolidated statements of income. NOI should not be considered as an alternative to income from continuing operations as an indication of our performance, or as an alternative to cash flows as a measure of liquidity or a measure of our ability to make distributions. 58 Comparison of the year ended December 31, 2013 , to the year ended December 31, 2012 The following table presents a comparison of the components of NOI for our Same Properties and Non-Same Properties for the year ended December 31, 2013 , compared to the year ended December 31, 2012 , and a reconciliation of NOI to income from continuing operations, the most directly comparable financial measure (dollars in thousands): Year Ended December 31, Revenues: 2013 2012 $ Change % Change Rental Same Properties $ 382,083 $ 373,589 $ 8,494 2.3 % Rental Non-Same Properties 85,681 49,204 36,477 74.1 Total rental 467,764 422,793 44,971 10.6 Tenant recoveries Same Properties 124,080 120,168 3,912 3.3 Tenant recoveries Non-Same Properties 26,015 13,112 12,903 98.4 Total tenant recoveries 150,095 133,280 16,815 12.6 Other income Same Properties 342 348 (6 ) (1.7 ) Other income Non-Same Properties 12,950 18,076 (5,126 ) (28.4 ) Total other income 13,292 18,424 (5,132 ) (27.9 ) Total revenues Same Properties 506,505 494,105 12,400 2.5 Total revenues Non-Same Properties 124,646 80,392 44,254 55.0 Total revenues 631,151 574,497 56,654 9.9 Expenses: Rental operations Same Properties 160,358 153,961 6,397 4.2 Rental operations Non-Same Properties 28,681 18,795 9,886 52.6 Total rental operations 189,039 172,756 16,283 9.4 NOI: NOI Same Properties 346,147 340,144 6,003 1.8 NOI Non-Same Properties 95,965 61,597 34,368 55.8 Total NOI 442,112 401,741 40,371 10.0 Other expenses: General and administrative 48,520 47,747 773 1.6 Interest 67,952 69,184 (1,232 ) (1.8 ) Depreciation and amortization 189,123 185,687 3,436 1.9 Impairment of land parcel 2,050 (2,050 ) (100.0 ) Loss on early extinguishment of debt 1,992 2,225 (233 ) (10.5 ) Total other expenses 307,587 306,893 694 0.2 Income from continuing operations $ 134,525 $ 94,848 $ 39,677 41.8 % NOI Same Properties GAAP basis $ 346,147 $ 340,144 $ 6,003 1.8 % Less: straight-line rent adjustments (5,299 ) (16,618 ) 11,319 (68.1 ) NOI Same Properties cash basis $ 340,848 $ 323,526 $ 17,322 5.4 % 59 Rental revenues Total rental revenues for the year ended December 31, 2013 , increased by $45.0 million , or 10.6% , to $467.8 million , compared to $422.8 million for the year ended December 31, 2012 . The increase was primarily due to rental revenues from our Non-Same Properties, including 23 development and redevelopment projects that were completed and delivered after January 1, 2012, and five operating properties that were acquired after January 1, 2012. In addition, rental revenues from our Same Properties increased by $8.5 million . Occupancy of Same Properties increased 80 basis points, to 93.5% as of December 31, 2013, from 92.7% as of December 31, 2012. Tenant recoveries Tenant recoveries for the year ended December 31, 2013 , increased by $16.8 million , or 12.6% , to $150.1 million , compared to $133.3 million for the year ended December 31, 2012 . This increase is consistent with the increase in our rental operating expenses of $16.3 million . Same Properties tenant recoveries increased by $3.9 million primarily as a result of an increase in Same Properties rental operating expenses of $6.4 million and higher occupancy for these properties in 2013. Rental operating expenses increased during the year ended December 31, 2013 , compared to the year ended December 31, 2012 , primarily due to an increase in operating costs related to colder weather in 2013, property tax rate increases for our properties located in Massachusetts, an increase in repairs and maintenance projects completed in 2013 compared to 2012, and overall higher occupancy in 2013. Non-Same Properties tenant recoveries increased by $12.9 million as a result of a Non-Same Properties rental operating expense increase of $9.9 million and higher occupancy for the development and redevelopment properties delivered since the beginning of 2012. As of December 31, 2013 , approximately 94% of our leases (on an RSF basis) were triple net leases, requiring client tenants to pay substantially all real estate taxes, insurance, utilities, common area expenses, and other operating expenses (including increases thereto) in addition to base rent. Other income Other income for the years ended December 31, 2013 and 2012 , of $13.3 million and $18.4 million , respectively, consisted of the following (in thousands): Year Ended December 31, 2013 2012 Change Management fee income $ 3,133 $ 2,679 $ 454 Interest income 4,589 3,364 1,225 Investment income 5,570 12,381 (6,811 ) Total other income $ 13,292 $ 18,424 $ (5,132 ) Total other income for the year ended December 31, 2013 , decreased by $5.1 million , or 27.9%, to $13.3 million , compared to $18.4 million for the year ended December 31, 2012 , primarily due to lower investment income in 2013. Investment income decreased largely due to a $5.8 million gain from an equity investment primarily related to one non-tenant life science entity during 2012. The decrease in investment income was partially offset by an increase in interest income. Rental operating expenses Total rental operating expenses for the year ended December 31, 2013 , increased by $16.3 million , or 9.4% , to $189.0 million , compared to $172.8 million for the year ended December 31, 2012 . Approximately $9.9 million of the increase was due to an increase in rental operating expenses from our Non-Same Properties, primarily related to 23 development and redevelopment projects that were completed and delivered after January 1, 2012, and five operating properties that were acquired after January 1, 2012. 60 General and administrative expenses General and administrative expenses remained relatively consistent at $48.5 million for the year ended December 31, 2013 , compared to $47.7 million for the year ended December 31, 2012 . Property acquisition-related expenses of $1.4 million for the year ended December 31, 2013, were offset by lower consulting fees in 2013. In 2012, we implemented new enterprise-wide software, which required temporary consulting services. The acquisition-related expenses incurred in 2013 were related to the acquisition of properties with in-place leases. The temporary consulting services were primarily related to data conversion costs and internal and external enterprise-software training costs. As a percentage of total assets, our general and administrative expenses were relatively consistent at 0.64% for the year ended December 31, 2013 , and 0.67% for the year ended December 31, 2012 . Interest expense Interest expense for the year ended December 31, 2013 , decreased by $1.2 million , or 1.8% , to $68.0 million , compared to $69.2 million for the year ended December 31, 2012 , detailed as follows (in thousands): Year Ended December 31, Component 2013 2012 Change Secured notes payable $ 38,496 $ 40,439 $ (1,943 ) Unsecured senior notes payable 36,456 21,255 15,201 Unsecured senior line of credit 7,007 12,035 (5,028 ) Unsecured senior bank term loans 20,934 25,567 (4,633 ) Interest rate swaps 15,422 22,309 (6,887 ) Amortization of loan fees and other interest 10,232 10,084 148 Unsecured senior convertible notes 20 246 (226 ) Subtotal 128,567 131,935 (3,368 ) Capitalized interest (60,615 ) (62,751 ) 2,136 Total interest expense $ 67,952 $ 69,184 $ (1,232 ) The total interest incurred decreased by $3.4 million during the year ended December 31, 2013 , compared to the year ended December 31, 2012 , primarily as a result of a $612.0 million reduction in our unsecured senior line of credit and unsecured senior bank term loans in 2013 and the decrease in expense related to the expiration, at various dates from September 2012 through September 2013, of certain interest rate swap agreements aggregating $250 million with rates ranging from 4.546% to 5.015%. As these interest rate swaps ended, we opted to leave a portion of the underlying debt unhedged in anticipation of a reduction of outstanding variable-rate debt that occurred during May 2013, when we issued $500.0 million of unsecured notes payable at a fixed rate of 3.90%. In addition, we reduced the outstanding principal balance outstanding on our unsecured senior bank term loans by $500 million in 2012 and 2013 and we amended our unsecured senior line of credit and unsecured senior bank term loans in 2013 to reduce our interest rate on outstanding borrowings. These decreases in interest costs have been partially offset by the increase in interest expense from the issuances of unsecured senior notes payable. Since the beginning of 2012, we have issued $1.05 billion of unsecured senior notes payable. The amended terms and corresponding interest rates of our senior bank term loans and our senior line of credit are as follows: Balance at December 31, 2013 Maturity Date Applicable Rate Facility Fee Facility Prior Amended Prior Amended Prior Amended 2016 Unsecured Senior Bank Term Loan $ 500 million June 2016 July 2016 L+1.75% L+1.20% N/A N/A 2019 Unsecured Senior Bank Term Loan $ 600 million January 2017 January 2019 L+1.50% L+1.20% N/A N/A $1.5 billion unsecured senior line of credit $ 204 million April 2017 January 2019 L+1.20% L+1.10% 0.25 % 0.20 % 61 Depreciation and amortization Depreciation and amortization for the year ended December 31, 2013 , increased by $3.4 million , or 1.9% , to $189.1 million , compared to $185.7 million for the year ended December 31, 2012 . Depreciation increased due to building improvements, including 23 development and redevelopment projects that were completed and delivered after January 1, 2012 , and five operating properties that were acquired in North America after January 1, 2012 . The increase in depreciation expense from 2012 to 2013 was partially offset by adjustments recognized in 2012 which were necessary to reduce the carrying amount of buildings and improvements in connection with planned redevelopments. Impairment of land parcel During the three months ended December 31, 2012 , we committed to sell a land parcel with 50,000 developable square feet rather than hold it on a long-term basis for future development. Upon our decision to sell, we reduced the costs of the land parcel to the anticipated sales price, less cost to sell. As a result, in the three months ended December 31, 2012 , we recognized an impairment charge of approximately $2.1 million. We completed the sale of this land parcel in May 2013 at an aggregate sales price of $2.7 million, and a gain upon sale of $391 thousand. Loss on early extinguishment of debt During the year ended December 31, 2013 , in conjunction with the refinancing of our unsecured senior bank term loans and the partial repayment of $250.0 million of our unsecured senior bank term loan due in 2016 ( 2016 Unsecured Senior Bank Term Loan ), we recognized a loss on early extinguishment of debt aggregating $2.0 million , related to the write-off of unamortized loan fees. During the year ended December 31, 2012 , we recognized a loss on early extinguishment of debt of approximately $2.2 million , including $1.6 million related to the write-off of unamortized loan fees upon modification of our unsecured senior line of credit and $0.6 million related to the write-off of unamortized loan fees resulting from the early repayment of our $250.0 million unsecured senior bank term loan due in 2012 ( 2012 Unsecured Senior Bank Term Loan ). Income from discontinued operations Income from discontinued operations, of $900 thousand and $8.8 million for the years ended December 31, 2013 and 2012, respectively, includes the results of operations of four operating properties that were classified as held for sale as of December 31, 2013 , as well as the results of operations (prior to disposition) and gain/loss on sale of real estate attributable to 13 properties sold subsequent to January 1, 2012, as well as any related impairment losses. During the year ended December 31, 2012, we recognized an impairment loss aggregating $11.4 million related to our decision to sell rather than hold our investment in 1124 Columbia Street in the Seattle market and One Innovation Drive, 377 Plantation Street, and 381 Plantation Street in the Greater Boston market. We completed the sale of these assets in 2013 along with our sale of 25/35/45 West Watkins Mill Road and 1201 Clopper Road in the Maryland market and 702 Electronic Drive in Pennsylvania, for an aggregate sales price of $128.6 million and a net loss on sale of $121 thousand . Gain on sale of land parcel During the year ended December 31, 2013 , we sold four parcels of land for aggregate consideration of $73.3 million and recognized an aggregate gain of $4.8 million , which included a gain of $4.1 million on the sale of our final land parcel in the Mission Bay submarket of the San Francisco Bay Area at 1600 Owens Street for $55.2 million . In March 2012, we completed an in-substance partial sale of our interest in a joint venture that owned a land parcel, resulting in a $1.9 million gain on sale of land parcel. See the Comparison of the year ended December 31, 2012 , to the year ended December 31, 2011 for further information. The land parcels sold did not meet the criteria for classification as discontinued operations since the parcels did not have any significant operations prior to disposition. Pursuant to the presentation and disclosure literature on gains/losses on sales or disposals by REITs required by the SEC, gains or losses on sales or disposals by a REIT that do not qualify as discontinued operations are classified below income from discontinued operations in the income statement. Accordingly, we classified the gain on sale of land parcel below income from discontinued operations, in the consolidated statements of income, and included the gain in income from continuing operations attributable to Alexandria Real Estate Equities, Inc. common stockholders in the control number, or numerator for the computation of earnings per share. 62 Comparison of the year ended December 31, 2012 , to the year ended December 31, 2011 The following table presents a comparison of the components of NOI for our Same Properties and Non-Same Properties for the year ended December 31, 2012 , compared to the year ended December 31, 2011 , and a reconciliation of NOI to income from continuing operations, the most directly comparable financial measure (dollars in thousands): Year Ended December 31, Revenues: 2012 2011 $ Change % Change Rental Same Properties $ 308,180 $ 306,693 $ 1,487 0.5 % Rental Non-Same Properties 114,613 98,122 16,491 16.8 Total rental 422,793 404,815 17,978 4.4 Tenant recoveries Same Properties 103,721 102,522 1,199 1.2 Tenant recoveries Non-Same Properties 29,559 23,683 5,876 24.8 Total tenant recoveries 133,280 126,205 7,075 5.6 Other income Same Properties 338 29 309 1,065.5 Other income Non-Same Properties 18,086 5,731 12,355 215.6 Total other income 18,424 5,760 12,664 219.9 Total revenues Same Properties 412,239 409,244 2,995 0.7 Total revenues Non-Same Properties 162,258 127,536 34,722 27.2 Total revenues 574,497 536,780 37,717 7.0 Expenses: Rental operations Same Properties 124,569 119,714 4,855 4.1 Rental operations Non-Same Properties 48,187 37,920 10,267 27.1 Total rental operations 172,756 157,634 15,122 9.6 NOI: NOI Same Properties 287,670 289,530 (1,860 ) (0.6 ) NOI Non-Same Properties 114,071 89,616 24,455 27.3 Total NOI 401,741 379,146 22,595 6.0 Other expenses: General and administrative 47,747 41,112 6,635 16.1 Interest 69,184 63,373 5,811 9.2 Depreciation and amortization 185,687 150,906 34,781 23.0 Impairment of land parcel 2,050 2,050 100.0 Loss on early extinguishment of debt 2,225 6,485 (4,260 ) (65.7 ) Total other expenses 306,893 261,876 45,017 17.2 Income from continuing operations $ 94,848 $ 117,270 $ (22,422 ) (19.1 )% NOI Same Properties GAAP basis $ 287,670 $ 289,530 $ (1,860 ) (0.6 )% Less: straight-line rent adjustments (5,582 ) (16,570 ) 10,988 (66.3 ) NOI Same Properties cash basis $ 282,088 $ 272,960 $ 9,128 3.3 % 63 Rental revenues Total rental revenues for the year ended December 31, 2012 , increased by $18.0 million , or 4.4% , to $422.8 million , compared to $404.8 million for the year ended December 31, 2011 . The increase was primarily due to rental revenues from our Non-Same Properties, including 21 development and redevelopment projects that were completed and delivered after January 1, 2011, and six operating properties that were acquired after January 1, 2011. Tenant recoveries Tenant recoveries for the year ended December 31, 2012 , increased by $7.1 million , or 5.6% , to $133.3 million , compared to $126.2 million for the year ended December 31, 2011 , due to an increase of $15.1 million , or 9.6% , of rental operating expenses. Same Properties tenant recoveries increased by $1.2 million , while Same Properties rental operating expenses increased by $4.9 million , primarily due to normal temporary vacancies throughout our Same Properties portfolio. Our Same Properties rental operating expenses increased primarily due to year-over-year increases in property taxes, property insurance rates, and the timing of repairs and maintenance expenses. Occupancy of Same Properties was 93.9% and 93.7% as of December 31, 2012 and 2011 , respectively. Non-Same Properties tenant recoveries increased by $5.9 million , while Non-Same Properties rental operating expenses increased by $10.3 million , primarily due to some vacancies related to development and redevelopment properties delivered since January 1, 2011, and an increase in certain non-recoverable expenses. As of December 31, 2012 , approximately 94% of our leases (on an RSF basis) were triple net leases, requiring client tenants to pay substantially all real estate taxes, insurance, utilities, common area expenses, and other operating expenses (including increases thereto) in addition to base rent. Other income Other income for the years ended December 31, 2012 and 2011, of $18.4 million and $5.8 million , respectively, was as follows (in thousands): Year Ended December 31, 2012 2011 Change Management fee income $ 2,679 $ 1,859 $ 820 Interest income 3,364 850 2,514 Investment income 12,381 3,051 9,330 Total other income $ 18,424 $ 5,760 $ 12,664 Total other income for the year ended December 31, 2012 , increased by $12.7 million , or 219.9%, to $18.4 million , compared to $5.8 million for the year ended December 31, 2011 . Investment income increased primarily due to a $5.8 million gain from an equity investment primarily related to one non-tenant life science entity and an overall increase in the investment income earned. Interest income also increased primarily as a result of the increase in interest earned from higher bank account balances. Rental operating expenses Total rental operating expenses for the year ended December 31, 2012 , increased by $15.1 million , or 9.6% , to $172.8 million , compared to $157.6 million for the year ended December 31, 2011 . Approximately $10.3 million of the increase was due to an increase in rental operating expenses from our Non-Same Properties, primarily related to 21 development and redevelopment projects that were completed and delivered after January 1, 2011, and six operating properties that were acquired after January 1, 2011. Rental operating expenses at our Same Properties increased $4.9 million primarily due to increases in property taxes, property insurance, and repairs and maintenance expenses, as discussed in Tenant Recoveries above. In October 2012, our property at 450 East 29th Street, the East Tower of the Alexandria Center for Life Science New York City, a multi-tenant building with 309,141 RSF, experienced water damage, along with many other properties owned by other landlords in New York City. Our assessment identified water damage in the underground parking area at our property, with no structural damage. The total estimated water damage and cleanup costs were approximately $800 thousand. 64 General and administrative expenses General and administrative expenses for the year ended December 31, 2012 , increased by $6.6 million , or 16.1% , to $47.7 million , compared to $41.1 million for the year ended December 31, 2011 . The increase was primarily due to costs associated with the Amended and Restated Employment Agreement with our Chief Executive Officer to provide a performance-based compensation program. Additionally, the increase in general and administrative expenses was related to an increase in the number of employees due to the growth in both the depth and breadth of our operations in multiple markets. During the year ended December 31, 2012 , our average number of employees increased by 25 employees, or 13%, to 221, compared to an average of 196 for the year ended December 31, 2011 . As a percentage of total assets, general and administrative expenses were relatively consistent at 0.67% for the year ended December 31, 2012 , compared to 0.63% for the year ended December 31, 2011 . Interest expense Interest expense for the year ended December 31, 2012 , increased by $5.8 million , or 9.2% , to $69.2 million , compared to $63.4 million for the year ended December 31, 2011 , detailed as follows (in thousands): Year Ended December 31, Component 2012 2011 Change Secured notes payable $ 40,439 $ 46,263 $ (5,824 ) Unsecured senior notes payable 21,255 21,255 Unsecured senior line of credit 12,035 21,583 (9,548 ) Unsecured senior bank term loans 25,567 16,085 9,482 Interest rate swaps 22,309 21,457 852 Amortization of loan fees and other interest 10,084 9,474 610 Unsecured senior convertible notes 246 9,567 (9,321 ) Subtotal 131,935 124,429 7,506 Capitalized interest (62,751 ) (61,056 ) (1,695 ) Total interest expense $ 69,184 $ 63,373 $ 5,811 Interest expense increased primarily due to the issuance of our unsecured senior notes payable since January 1, 2011, and an increase in the balance outstanding on our unsecured senior bank term loans from a weighted average outstanding balance of $1.0 billion for the year ended December 31, 2011 , to a weighted average outstanding balance of $1.4 billion for the year ended December 31, 2012 . This increase was partially offset by repayments of nine secured notes payable approximating $71.2 million and repurchases of our 3.70% unsecured senior convertible notes ( 3.70% Unsecured Senior Convertible Notes ) aggregating $84.7 million since January 1, 2011. Interest expense related to our unsecured senior line of credit also decreased, primarily due to a lower average outstanding balance of $414.8 million during the year ended December 31, 2012, compared to $746.8 million during the year ended December 31, 2011 , and a decrease in the effective interest rate of our unsecured senior line of credit from 2.6% as of December 31, 2011 , to 1.4% as of December 31, 2012 . Depreciation and amortization Depreciation and amortization for the year ended December 31, 2012 , increased by $34.8 million , or 23.0% , to $185.7 million , compared to $150.9 million for the year ended December 31, 2011 . The increase resulted primarily from increased depreciation related to building improvements, including 21 development and redevelopment projects that were completed and delivered after January 1, 2011, and six operating properties that were acquired after January 1, 2011. Depreciation also increased as a result of depreciation adjustments necessary to reduce the carrying amount of buildings and improvements in connection with planned redevelopments. Impairment of land parcel During the three months ended December 31, 2012 , we committed to sell a land parcel with 50,000 developable square feet rather than hold it on a long-term basis for future development. Upon our decision to sell, we reduced the costs of the land parcel to our estimate of fair value, based on the anticipated sales price, less cost to sell. As a result, we recognized an impairment charge of approximately $2.1 million. We completed the sale of this land parcel in May 2013 at an aggregate sales price of $2.7 million and a gain upon sale of approximately $391 thousand. 65 Loss on early extinguishment of debt During the year ended December 31, 2012 , we recognized a loss on early extinguishment of debt of approximately $2.2 million , including $1.6 million related to the write-off of unamortized loan fees upon modification of our unsecured senior line of credit and $0.6 million related to the write-off of unamortized loan fees resulting from the early repayment of $250.0 million of our 2012 Unsecured Senior Bank Term Loan. During the year ended December 31, 2011 , we recognized a loss on early extinguishment of debt of approximately $6.5 million related to the repurchase, in privately negotiated transactions, of approximately $217.1 million principal amount of our 3.70% Unsecured Senior Convertible Notes and the partial and early repayment of our 2012 Unsecured Senior Bank Term Loan. Income from discontinued operations Income from discontinued operations of $8.8 million and $18.1 million for the years ended December 31, 2012 and 2011, respectively, includes the results of operations of four operating properties that were classified as held for sale as of December 31, 2013 , as well as the results of operations (prior to disposition) and gain/loss on sale of real estate attributable to 14 properties sold subsequent to January 1, 2011, as well as any related impairment losses. During the three months ended September 30, 2012, we committed to sell four operating properties: 1124 Columbia Street in the Seattle market and One Innovation Drive, 377 Plantation Street, and 381 Plantation Street in the suburban Greater Boston market, aggregating 504,130 RSF, rather than to hold them on a long-term basis. At the time of our commitment to dispose of these assets, these four properties were on average 94% occupied and generated approximately $12.8 million in annual operating income. Upon our commitment to sell, we reduced the net book value of these assets to the anticipated sales price, less cost to sell. As a result, we recognized an impairment charge of approximately $9.8 million. In December 2012, we entered into an agreement with a third party for the sale of 1124 Columbia Street at a price of $42.6 million, which was below our reduced carrying costs as of September 30, 2012. As a result, we recognized an additional impairment charge of $1.6 million in order to reduce the carrying costs to our revised estimated fair value less cost to sell. We completed the sale of these assets in 2013 along with our sale of 25/35/45 West Watkins Mill Road and 1201 Clopper Road in the Maryland market and 702 Electronic Drive in Pennsylvania, for an aggregate sales price of $128.6 million and a net loss upon sale of $121 thousand . Gain on sale of land parcel In March 2012, we completed an in-substance partial sale on a portion of our interest in a joint venture, and admitted as a 50% member Clarion Partners, LLC, resulting in a reduction of our ownership interest from 55% to 27.5%. The transfer of one-half of our 55% ownership interest in this real estate venture to Clarion Partners, LLC, was accounted for as an in-substance partial sale of an interest in the underlying real estate. In connection with the sale of one-half of our 55% ownership interest in the land parcel, we received a special distribution of approximately $22.3 million, which included the recognition of a $1.9 million gain on sale of land and approximately $5.4 million from our share of loan refinancing proceeds. In August 2011, we completed the sale of a land parcel in our San Diego market for an aggregate sales price of approximately $17.3 million, at a gain on sale of approximately $46,000. The land parcels sold did not meet the criteria for classification as discontinued operations since the parcels did not have any significant operations prior to disposition. Pursuant to the presentation and disclosure literature on gains/losses on sales or disposals by REITs required by the SEC, gains or losses on sales or disposals by a REIT that do not qualify as discontinued operations are classified below income from discontinued operations in the income statement. Accordingly, in the consolidated statements of income, we classified the gain on sale of land parcel below income from discontinued operations and included the gain in income from continuing operations attributable to Alexandria Real Estate Equities, Inc. common stockholders in the control number, or numerator, for the computation of earnings per share. 66 Projected results Based on our current view of existing market conditions and certain current assumptions, we have updated guidance for earnings per share attributable to Alexandria common stockholders diluted and reaffirmed guidance for FFO per share attributable to Alexandria common stockholders diluted, each for the year ended December 31, 2014, as set forth in the table below. The table below provides a reconciliation of FFO per share attributable to Alexandria common stockholders diluted, a non-GAAP measure, to earnings per share, the most directly comparable GAAP measure, and other key assumptions included in our guidance for the year ended December 31, 2014. 2014 Guidance EPS and FFO Per Share Low High Earnings per share attributable to Alexandria common stockholders diluted $1.75 $1.95 Add back: depreciation and amortization 2.87 Other (0.02) FFO per share attributable to Alexandria common stockholders diluted $4.60 $4.80 Key Assumptions (Dollars in thousands) 2014 Guidance Low High Occupancy percentage for operating properties as of December 31, 2014: North America 96.5 % 97.0 % Rental rate steps on lease renewals and re-leasing of space: Cash basis 3% 5% GAAP basis 8% 11% Same Property NOI growth: Cash basis 4% 6% GAAP basis 2% 4% Straight-line rents $ 42,000 $ 47,000 General and administrative expenses $ 48,000 $ 52,000 Capitalization of interest $ 35,000 $ 45,000 Interest expense $ 77,000 $ 93,000 As of December 31, 2013 , we had construction in progress related to our five North American development projects and one North American redevelopment project, respectively. The completion of these projects, along with recently delivered projects, certain future projects, and contributions from Same Properties, is expected to contribute significant increases in rental income, NOI, and cash flows. Operating performance assumptions related to the completion of our development and redevelopment projects in North America, including the timing of initial occupancy, stabilization dates, and Initial Stabilized Yield, are included in Item 2. Properties Investments in Real Estate. Certain key assumptions regarding our projections, including the impact of various development and redevelopment projects, are included in the tables above and in the Development and Redevelopment Projects in North America table in Item 2. Properties Investments in Real Estate and in Sources and Uses of Capital, including the Projected Construction Spending table. The completion of our development and redevelopment projects will result in the increase of interest expense and other project costs, because these project costs will no longer qualify for capitalization and these costs will be expensed as incurred. Our projection assumptions for straight-line rents, general and administrative expenses, capitalization of interest, interest expense, and Same Property NOI growth are included in the tables on this page and are subject to a number of variables and uncertainties, including those discussed under the Forward-looking Statements section of Part I, the Risk Factors section of Item 1A, and the Management Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations section under Item 7, of this annual report on Form 10-K for the year ended December 31, 2013 . To the extent our full-year earnings guidance is updated during the year, we will provide additional disclosure supporting reasons for any significant changes to such guidance. 67 Liquidity and capital resources Overview We expect to meet certain long-term liquidity requirements, such as requirements for property acquisitions, development, redevelopment, other construction projects, capital improvements, tenant improvements, leasing costs, non-revenue-generating expenditures, and scheduled debt maturities, through net cash provided by operating activities, periodic asset sales, strategic joint venture capital, and long-term secured and unsecured indebtedness, including borrowings under our unsecured senior line of credit, unsecured senior bank term loans, and the issuance of additional debt and/or equity securities. We expect to continue meeting our short-term liquidity and capital requirements, as further detailed in this section, generally through our working capital and net cash provided by operating activities. We believe that the net cash provided by operating activities will continue to be sufficient to enable us to make the distributions necessary to continue qualifying as a REIT. Over the next several years, our balance sheet, capital structure, and liquidity objectives are as follows: Reduce our amount of unsecured bank debt; Maintain diverse sources of capital, including sources from net cash provided by operating activities, unsecured debt, secured debt, selective asset sales, joint ventures, preferred stock, and common stock; Manage the amount of debt maturing in a single year; Mitigate unhedged variable-rate debt exposure through the reduction of short-term and medium-term variable-rate bank debt; Maintain adequate liquidity from net cash provided by operating activities, cash and cash equivalents, and available borrowing capacity under our unsecured senior line of credit and available commitments under secured construction loans; Maintain a large unencumbered asset pool to provide financial flexibility; Fund preferred stock and common stock dividends from net cash provided by operating activities; Retain positive cash flows from operating activities after payment of dividends for reinvestment in acquisitions and/or development and redevelopment projects; Continue to reduce our non-income-producing assets as a percentage of our gross investment in real estate through our continued delivery of development and redevelopment projects, and selective land sales; and Maintain solid key credit metrics, including net debt to adjusted EBITDA and fixed charge coverage ratio, with some variation from quarter to quarter and year to year. 68 Unsecured senior line of credit and unsecured senior bank term loans On July 26, 2013, we amended our 2016 Unsecured Senior Bank Term Loan to reduce the interest rate on outstanding borrowings. We expect to repay this loan over the next three years. In addition, on August 30, 2013, we amended our $1.5 billion unsecured senior line of credit and our 2019 unsecured senior bank term loan ( 2019 Unsecured Senior Bank Term Loan ) to reduce the interest rate on outstanding borrowings, extend the maturity dates, and amend certain financial covenants. Also on August 30, 2013, we amended our 2016 Unsecured Senior Bank Term Loan to conform certain financial covenants to those contained in the amended credit agreement related to the unsecured senior line of credit and the 2019 Unsecured Senior Bank Term Loan. The maturity dates below reflect available extension options that we control. Balance at December 31, 2013 Maturity Date Applicable Rate Facility Fee Facility Prior Amended Prior Amended Prior Amended 2016 Unsecured Senior Bank Term Loan $ 500 million June 2016 July 2016 L+1.75% L+1.20% N/A N/A 2019 Unsecured Senior Bank Term Loan $ 600 million January 2017 January 2019 L+1.50% L+1.20% N/A N/A $1.5 billion unsecured senior line of credit $ 204 million April 2017 January 2019 L+1.20% L+1.10% 0.25 % 0.20 % During the year ended December 31, 2013 , in conjunction with aggregate paydown of $250.0 million of our 2016 Unsecured Senior Bank Term Loan and the refinancing of our unsecured senior bank term loans, we recognized a loss on early extinguishment of debt aggregating $2.0 million , related to the write-off of unamortized loan fees. The maturity date of the unsecured senior line of credit is January 2019, assuming we exercise our sole right to extend the stated maturity date, twice, by an additional six months after each exercise. Borrowings under the unsecured senior line of credit will bear interest at LIBOR or the base rate specified in the amended unsecured senior line of credit agreement, plus in either case a specified margin ( Applicable Margin ). The Applicable Margin for LIBOR borrowings under the unsecured senior line of credit is based on our existing credit rating as set by certain rating agencies. As of December 31, 2013 , we had $204.0 million of borrowings outstanding. See Note 6 to our consolidated financial statements in Item 15 of this report for the Applicable Margin in effect at December 31, 2013 . In addition to the Applicable Margin, our unsecured senior line of credit is subject to an annual facility fee of 0.20%. The requirements of, and our actual performance with respect to, the key financial covenants under our unsecured senior line of credit and unsecured senior bank term loans as of December 31, 2013 , were as follows: Covenant Ratios (1) Requirement Actual (2) Leverage Ratio Less than or equal to 60.0% 32.2% Secured Debt Ratio Less than or equal to 45.0% 7.3% Fixed Charge Coverage Ratio Greater than or equal to 1.50x 2.67x Unsecured Leverage Ratio Less than or equal to 60.0% 37.4% Unsecured Interest Coverage Ratio Greater than or equal to 1.50x 7.43x (1) For a definition of the ratios, refer to the amended unsecured senior line of credit and unsecured senior bank term loan agreements, each dated as of August 30, 2013, which was filed as exhibits to the Quarterly Report for the three and nine months ended September 30, 2013, on Form 10-Q. (2) Actual covenants are calculated pursuant to the specific terms to our unsecured senior line of credit and unsecured senior bank term loan agreements. 69 Unsecured senior notes payable The requirements of, and our actual performance with respect to, the key financial covenants under our 3.90% Unsecured Senior Notes and 4.60% Unsecured Senior Notes as of December 31, 2013 , were as follows: Covenant Ratios (1) Requirement Actual Total Debt to Total Assets Less than or equal to 60% 36% Secured Debt to Total Assets Less than or equal to 40% 8% Consolidated EBITDA to Interest Expense Greater than or equal to 1.5x 6.0x Unencumbered Total Asset Value to Unsecured Debt Greater than or equal to 150% 264% (1) For a definition of the ratios, refer to the most current indenture and related supplements, which are filed with the SEC as exhibits to our Current Report on Form 8-K on February 29, 2012, and June 7, 2013. In addition, the terms of the indentures, among other things, limit the ability of the Company, Alexandria Real Estate Equities, L.P., and the Company subsidiaries to (i) consummate a merger, or consolidate or sell all or substantially all of the Company assets, and (ii) incur certain secured or unsecured indebtedness. Sources and uses of capital We expect that our principal liquidity needs for the year ended December 31, 2014, will be satisfied by the following multiple sources of capital as shown in the table below. There can be no assurance that our sources and uses of capital will not be materially higher or lower than these expectations. Sources and Uses of Capital (In thousands) Low High Sources of capital: Unsecured senior notes payable $ 350,000 $ 450,000 Secured loan additions (construction loans and assumed debt) (1) 100,000 223,000 Secured notes payable repayments (2) (210,000 ) (210,000 ) Activity on our unsecured senior line of credit and senior unsecured term loan 80,000 (53,000 ) Sources of debt capital 320,000 410,000 Net cash provided by operating activities after dividends 100,000 120,000 Land sales/strategic joint venture capital (3) 145,000 245,000 Total sources of capital $ 565,000 $ 775,000 Uses of capital: Construction $ 565,000 $ 625,000 Acquisitions 150,000 Total uses of capital $ 565,000 $ 775,000 (1) Includes the assumption of a non-recourse secured note payable of $40.7 million in connection with the acquisition of a property in January 2014. (2) Represents the principal amortization payments on all of our secured notes payable, including one secured note payable related to Alexandria Technology Square that was repaid on January 31, 2014 . This amount excludes $20.9 million that was funded by our 10% joint venture partner. (3) Projected joint venture of non-income-producing assets. The key assumptions behind the sources and uses of capital in the table above are a favorable capital market environment and performance of our core operations in areas such as delivery of current and future development and redevelopment projects, leasing activity, and renewals. Our expected sources and uses of capital are subject to a number of variables and uncertainties, including those discussed under the Forward-Looking Statements section of Part I, the Risk Factors section of Item 1A, and the Management Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations section under Item 7, of our annual report on Form 10-K for the year ended December 31, 2013 . We expect to update our forecast of sources and uses of capital on a quarterly basis. 70 Sources of capital Real estate sales / strategic joint venture capital We continue the disciplined execution of our asset recycling program to monetize non-strategic non-income-producing assets as a source of capital through asset sales or from joint venture proceeds. During 2013 we sold four land parcels for aggregate consideration of $73.3 million . For 2014, we expect to monetize $145 million to $245 million through the sale of land or from joint venture proceeds related to non-income-producing assets. We completed substantially all significant sales of non-strategic income-producing assets targeted for 2013 aggregating $128.6 million . As of December 31, 2013, we had four properties classified as held for sale with an aggregate book value of $7.6 million. Secured construction loans In May 2013, we closed a secured construction loan with aggregate commitments of $36.0 million for our 100% pre-leased development project at 269 East Grand Avenue in the San Francisco Bay Area market. The construction loan matures in June 2016, and we have an option to extend the stated maturity date of June 1, 2016, by one year, twice, to June 1, 2018, subject to certain conditions. The construction loan bears interest at LIBOR or the base rate specified in the construction loan agreement, defined as the higher of either the prime rate being offered by our lender or the federal funds rate in effect on the day of borrowing ( Base Rate ), plus in either case a specified margin of 1.40% for LIBOR borrowings or 0.25% for Base Rate borrowings. As of December 31, 2013, commitments of $36.0 million were available under this loan. In August 2013, we closed a secured construction loan for our development project at 75/125 Binney Street in the Greater Boston market. The construction loan matures in August 2017, and we have an option to extend the stated maturity date of August 23, 2017, by one year , to August 23, 2018, subject to certain conditions. The construction loan bears interest at the LIBOR or the Base Rate specified in the construction loan agreement, plus in either case a specified margin of 1.35% for LIBOR borrowings or 0.35% for Base Rate borrowings. As of December 31, 2013, 100% of commitments aggregating $250.4 million were available under this loan. In June 2012, we closed a secured construction loan with aggregate commitments of $55.0 million . The construction loan matures in July 2015, and we have an option to extend the stated maturity date of July 1, 2015, by one year , twice, to July 1, 2017, subject to certain conditions. The construction loan bears interest at the LIBOR or the base rate specified in the construction loan agreement, defined as the higher of either the prime rate being offered by our lender or the Base Rate, plus in either case a specified margin of 1.50% for LIBOR borrowings or 0.25% for Base Rate borrowings. As of December 31, 2013, the outstanding loan balance was $46.0 million and commitments of $9.0 million were available under this loan. Unsecured senior line of credit We use our unsecured senior line of credit to fund working capital, construction activities, and, from time to time, acquisition of properties. As of December 31, 2013 , we had $1.3 billion available for borrowing under our $1.5 billion unsecured senior line of credit. Borrowings under the unsecured senior line of credit will bear interest at a Eurocurrency Rate or a Base Rate specified in the amended unsecured line of credit agreement, plus, in either case, the Applicable Margin. The Eurocurrency Rate specified in the amended unsecured line of credit agreement is, as applicable, the rate per annum equal to (i) the LIBOR or a successor rate thereto as approved by the administrative agent for loans denominated in a LIBOR quoted currency (i.e., U.S. Dollars, Euro, Sterling, or Yen), (ii) the average annual yield rates applicable to Canadian dollar banker's acceptances for loans denominated in Canadian dollars, (iii) the Bank Bill Swap Reference Bid rate for loans denominated in Australian dollars, or (iv) the rate designated with respect to the applicable alternative currency for loans denominated in a non-LIBOR quoted currency (other than Canadian or Australian dollars). The Base Rate specified in the amended unsecured line of credit agreement means for any day a fluctuating rate per annum equal to the highest of (a) the federal funds rate plus 1/2 of 1%, (b) the rate of interest in effect for such day as publicly announced from time to time by Bank of America as its prime rate, and (c) the Eurocurrency Rate plus 1.00% . The Applicable Margin for LIBOR borrowings under the unsecured senior line of credit as of December 31, 2013 , was 1.10% , which is based on our existing credit rating as set by certain rating agencies. As of December 31, 2013 , we had $204 million in borrowings outstanding on our $1.5 billion unsecured senior line of credit. Our unsecured senior line of credit is subject to an annual facility fee of 0.20% based on the aggregate commitments outstanding. 71 Liquidity The following table presents the remaining availability under our unsecured senior line of credit, secured construction loans, and cash and cash equivalents as of December 31, 2013 (dollars in thousands): Description Stated Rate Total Commitments Outstanding Balance Available Liquidity $1.5 Billion Unsecured Senior Line of Credit LIBOR +1.10% $ 1,500,000 $ 204,000 $ 1,296,000 259 East Grand Avenue Secured Construction Loan LIBOR + 1.50% 55,000 46,013 8,987 269 East Grand Avenue Secured Construction Loan LIBOR + 1.40% 36,000 36,000 75/125 Binney Street Secured Construction Loan LIBOR + 1.35% 250,400 250,400 $ 1,841,400 $ 250,013 1,591,387 Cash and Cash Equivalents 57,696 Total $ 1,649,083 Cash and cash equivalents As of December 31, 2013 , we had approximately $57.7 million of cash and cash equivalents. We expect existing cash and cash equivalents, cash flows from operating activities, proceeds from asset sales, secured construction loan borrowings, issuances of unsecured notes payable, and issuances of common stock to continue to be sufficient to fund our operating activities and cash commitments for investing and financing activities, such as regular quarterly dividends, scheduled debt repayments, and material capital expenditures, for at least the next 12 months, and thereafter for the foreseeable future. Restricted cash Restricted cash consisted of the following as of December 31, 2013 , and December 31, 2012 (in thousands): December 31, 2013 December 31, 2012 Funds held in trust under the terms of certain secured notes payable $ 14,572 $ 17,904 Funds held in escrow related to construction projects 5,655 5,652 Other restricted funds 7,482 16,391 Total $ 27,709 $ 39,947 The funds held in escrow related to construction projects will be used to pay for certain construction costs. Secured notes payable In December 2013, we extended the maturity date of a $76.0 million secured note payable from April 20, 2014, to January 20, 2017. 3.90% Unsecured Senior Notes payable offering In June 2013, we completed the issuance of our 3.90% Unsecured Senior Notes due in June 2023. Net proceeds of approximately $498.6 million were initially used to prepay a portion of the outstanding principal balance of $750.0 million on our 2016 Unsecured Senior Bank Term Loan and to reduce the outstanding borrowings on our unsecured senior line of credit to zero. As a result of the partial prepayment of our term loan, we recognized a loss on early extinguishment of debt related to the write-off of a portion of unamortized loan fees. See Note 6 to our consolidated financial statements in Item 15 of this Report. 72 Other sources Under our current shelf registration statement filed with the SEC, we may offer common stock, preferred stock, debt, and other securities. These securities may be issued from time to time at our discretion based on our needs and market conditions, including as necessary to balance our use of incremental debt capital. We hold interests, together with certain third parties, in companies that we consolidate in our financial statements. These third parties may contribute equity into these entities primarily related to their share of funds for construction-related and financing-related activities. In January 2014, our joint venture partner funded approximately $20.9 million related to the repayment of our $208.7 million secured note payable collateralized by Alexandria Technology Square . The following table presents information related to debt held by our consolidated and unconsolidated joint ventures (dollars in thousands): Our JV Ownership Percentage December 31, 2013 Interest Rate Loan Collateral Type Total Outstanding Our Share Third-Party Share Maturity Date (1) Alexandria Technology Square 90.0% Consolidated $ 208,683 (2) $ 187,815 $ 20,868 4/1/2014 5.59% 360 Longwood Avenue 27.5% Unconsolidated $ 87,856 (3) $ 24,160 $ 63,696 4/1/2019 5.25% (1) Includes any extension options that we control. (2) Represents secured note payable that was repaid on January 31, 2014 . (3) Construction loan that has an aggregate commitment of $213.2 million and bears interest at LIBOR+3.75%, with a floor of 5.25%. Uses of capital Summary of capital expenditures The primary use of capital has historically been related to the development, redevelopment, and construction of properties. In North America, we currently have development projects under way for 947,927 RSF of laboratory space. In addition, we have a 27.5% interest in an unconsolidated joint venture that is currently developing a building aggregating 413,536 RSF in the Longwood Medical Area of the Greater Boston market. We incur construction costs related to development, redevelopment, and other construction activities and additional project costs, including interest, property taxes, insurance, and other costs directly related and essential to the development or construction of a project during periods when activities necessary to prepare an asset for its intended use are in progress. 73 The following tables summarize the total projected capital expenditures for the year ended December 31, 2014, and the components of our total actual capital expenditures for the year ended December 31, 2013 , which include interest, property taxes, insurance, payroll, and other indirect project costs (in thousands): Projected Construction Spending Year Ended December 31, 2014 Current value-creation projects in North America: Development $ 325,000 Redevelopment 8,000 Developments/redevelopments recently transferred to rental properties 50,000 (1) Generic laboratory infrastructure/building improvement projects 45,000 (2) Current value-creation projects in North America 428,000 Near-term value-creation projects: Development 62,500 (3) Redevelopment 37,000 (4) Predevelopment 60,000 (5) Near-term value-creation projects 159,500 Value-creation projects 587,500 Non-revenue-enhancing capital expenditures 12,500 Total construction spending $ 600,000 Guidance range $ 565,000 - 625,000 (1) Developments/redevelopments recently transferred to rental properties include certain vacancies, generally less than 10% of the project, that may require additional construction prior to occupancy. For example, our recently delivered redevelopment projects at 4757 Nexus Center Drive, 400 Technology Square, 343 Oyster Point Boulevard, 1616 Eastlake Avenue, 1551 Eastlake Avenue, and 10300 Campus Point Drive generally have 15,000 to 30,000 RSF of value-creation activities to complete in connection with the lease-up and delivery of the space. (2) Includes, among others, generic infrastructure building improvement projects in North America, including 300 Technology Square, 5810/5820 Nancy Ridge Drive, 8000 Virginia Manor Road, and 44 Hartwell Avenue. (3) Near-term value-creation development projects include, among others, 5200 Illumina Way. (4) Near-term value-creation redevelopment projects include, among others, 3033 Science Park Road and 10121 Barnes Canyon Road. These projects were acquired in the second quarter of 2012 and the third quarter of 2013, respectively. (5) Includes traditional preconstruction costs plus predevelopment costs related to: (i) approximately $17 million of site and infrastructure costs for the 1.2 million RSF related to 50 Binney Street, 60 Binney Street, and 100 Binney Street at the Alexandria Center at Kendall Square, including utility access and roads, installation of storm drain systems, infiltration systems, traffic lighting/signals, streets, and sidewalks, and (ii) approximately $4 million related to the design, permitting, and construction drawings related to 50 Binney Street and 60 Binney Street. Site and infrastructure costs related to 75/125 Binney Street are included in our estimate of cost at completion and initial stabilized yields. There can be no assurance that our projected capital expenditures will not be materially lower or higher than these expectations. Historical construction spending (In thousands) Year Ended December 31, 2013 Development North America $ 353,064 Redevelopment North America 112,289 Predevelopment 59,657 Generic laboratory infrastructure/building improvement projects in North America (1) 46,814 Development and redevelopment Asia 10,107 Total construction spending $ 581,931 (1) Includes revenue-enhancing projects and amounts shown in the table below related to non-revenue-enhancing capital expenditures. 74 The tables below show the average per square foot property-related non-revenue-enhancing capital expenditures, tenant improvements, and leasing costs (excluding capital expenditures and tenant improvements that are recoverable from client tenants, revenue-enhancing, or related to properties that have undergone redevelopment) during the years ended December 31, 2013 and 2012 (dollars in thousands, except per square foot amounts): Year Ended December 31, 2013 2012 Non-revenue-enhancing Capital Expenditures, Tenant Improvements, and Leasing Costs Amount Square Feet Per Square Foot Amount Square Feet Per Square Foot Non-revenue-enhancing capital expenditures $ 3,461 13,963,661 $ 0.25 $ 2,068 14,115,129 $ 0.15 Tenant improvements and leasing costs: Re-tenanted space $ 6,042 401,880 $ 15.03 $ 2,673 284,263 $ 9.40 Renewal space 9,860 1,436,517 6.86 6,508 1,191,140 5.46 Total tenant improvements and leasing costs $ 15,902 1,838,397 $ 8.65 $ 9,181 1,475,403 $ 6.22 We expect our capital expenditures, tenant improvements, and leasing costs (excluding capital expenditures and tenant improvements that are recoverable from client tenants, revenue-enhancing, or related to properties that have undergone redevelopment) on a per square foot basis in 2014 to be approximately similar to the amounts shown in the preceding table. We capitalize interest cost as a cost of the project only during the period for which activities necessary to prepare an asset for its intended use are ongoing, provided that expenditures for the asset have been made and interest cost has been incurred. Capitalized interest for the years ended December 31, 2013 and 2012 , of approximately $60.6 million and $62.8 million , respectively, is classified in investments in real estate, net. Indirect project costs, including construction administration, legal fees, and office costs that clearly relate to projects under development or construction, are capitalized as incurred during the period an asset is undergoing activities to prepare it for its intended use. We capitalized payroll and other indirect project costs related to development, redevelopment, and construction projects, aggregating approximately $17.5 million and $13.4 million for the years ended December 31, 2013 and 2012 , respectively. Additionally, should we cease activities necessary to prepare an asset for its intended use, the interest, taxes, insurance, and certain other direct project costs related to this asset would be expensed as incurred. When construction activities cease, the asset is transferred out of construction in progress and classified as rental properties, net. Also, if vertical aboveground construction is not initiated at completion of predevelopment activities, the land parcel will be classified as land held for future development. Expenditures for repairs and maintenance are expensed as incurred. Fluctuations in our development, redevelopment, and construction activities could result in significant changes to total expenses and net income. For example, had we experienced a 10% reduction in development, redevelopment, and construction activities without a corresponding decrease in indirect project costs, including interest and payroll, total expenses would have increased by approximately $7.7 million for the year ended December 31, 2013 . We also capitalize and defer initial direct costs to originate leases with independent third parties related to evaluating a prospective lessee financial condition, negotiating lease terms, preparing the lease agreement, and closing the lease transaction. Costs that we have capitalized and deferred relate to successful leasing transactions, result directly from and are essential to the lease transaction, and would not have been incurred had that leasing transaction not occurred. The initial direct costs capitalized and deferred also include the portion of our employees total compensation and payroll-related fringe benefits directly related to time spent performing activities previously described and related to the respective lease that would not have been performed but for that lease. Total initial direct leasing costs capitalized during the years ended December 31, 2013 and 2012 , were approximately $43.8 million and $45.9 million , respectively, of which approximately $11.0 million and $10.6 million , respectively, represented capitalized and deferred payroll costs directly related and essential to our leasing activities during such periods. Acquisitions On July 5, 2013, we agreed to invest $13.1 million at 10121/10151 Barnes Canyon Road, a 115,895 RSF office property located in the Sorrento Mesa submarket of San Diego. Our investment of $5.4 million was funded in August 2013 and an additional $7.7 million will be funded no later than October 2014. The property is currently 100% occupied with leases that expire in 2014 and 2015. We intend to convert the existing office space into laboratory space through redevelopment when the spaces become available. Initial stabilized yields and average cash yield will be provided in the future upon commencement of the redevelopment. 75 On September 16, 2013, we acquired 407 Davis Drive, a Class A laboratory/office property in our Research Triangle Park market for a total purchase price of $19.4 million. The building consists of 81,956 RSF and is 100% leased to Bayer AG. The initial stabilized cash and GAAP yields are 7.8% and 8.7%, respectively. The estimated average cash yield for the project is 8.7%. On November 12, 2013 , we acquired three adjacent buildings aggregating 55,213 RSF at 11055, 11065, and 11075 Roselle Street in the Sorrento Valley submarket of San Diego for a total purchase price of $8.3 million . The buildings are currently undergoing redevelopment and we pre-leased 75% of the space to Tandem Diabetes Care, Inc. The estimated initial stabilized yields for this project are 7.8% and 7.9% , on a cash and GAAP basis, respectively. The estimated average cash yield for the project is 8.0% . On November 27, 2013 , we acquired 150 Second Street , a 123,210 RSF, newly developed Class A property in the Cambridge submarket of Greater Boston , for a total purchase price of $94.5 million . The building is 85% leased to two publicly traded life science companies. The estimated initial stabilized yields for this property are 7.3% and 7.5% , on a cash and GAAP basis, respectively. The estimated average cash yield for the project is 8.2%. 2016 Unsecured Senior Bank Term Loan repayment As part of our continuing transition from bank debt financing to unsecured senior notes payable, and from variable-rate debt to fixed-rate debt, and from short-term debt to long-term debt, we repaid $250.0 million of our 2016 Unsecured Senior Bank Term Loan during the year ended December 31, 2013 . As a result of this early prepayment, we recognized a loss on early extinguishment of debt related to the write-off of a portion of unamortized loan fees during the year ended December 31, 2013 , aggregating $2.0 million . Contractual obligations and commitments Contractual obligations as of December 31, 2013 , consisted of the following (in thousands): Payments by Period Total 2014 2015-2016 2017-2018 Thereafter Secured and unsecured debt (1) (2) (3) $ 3,062,837 $ 229,577 $ 792,165 $ 79,853 $ 1,961,242 Estimated interest payments on fixed-rate and hedged variable-rate debt (4) 137,902 44,729 62,235 20,395 10,543 Estimated interest payments on variable-rate debt (5) 26,751 5,758 18,850 2,143 Ground lease obligations 687,447 10,520 20,404 21,234 635,289 Other obligations 8,827 1,324 2,862 3,159 1,482 Total $ 3,923,764 $ 291,908 $ 896,516 $ 126,784 $ 2,608,556 (1) Amounts represent principal amounts due and exclude unamortized premiums/discounts reflected on the consolidated balance sheets. (2) Amounts include noncontrolling interests share of scheduled principal maturities of approximately $20.9 million, all of which matures in 2014. See discussion under Note 6, Secured and Unsecured Senior Debt, for additional information. (3) Payment dates include any extension options that we control. (4) Estimated interest payments on our fixed-rate debt and hedged variable-rate debt were based upon contractual interest rates, including the impact of interest rate swap agreements, interest payment dates, and scheduled maturity dates. (5) The interest payments on variable-rate debt were based on the interest rates in effect as of December 31, 2013 . Secured notes payable Secured notes payable as of December 31, 2013 , consisted of 15 notes secured by 38 properties. Our secured notes payable typically require monthly payments of principal and interest and had weighted average interest rates of approximately 5.45% as of December 31, 2013 . Noncontrolling interests share of consolidated secured notes payable aggregated approximately $20.9 million as of December 31, 2013 . The total book values of rental properties, net, land held for future development, and construction in progress securing debt were approximately $1.6 billion as of December 31, 2013 . As of December 31, 2013 , our secured notes payable, including unamortized discounts, were composed of approximately $586.6 million and $122.2 million of fixed and variable-rate debt, respectively. On January 31, 2014 , we repaid our $208.7 million secured note payable related to Alexandria Technology Square . Our joint venture partner funded $20.9 million of the proceeds required to repay the secured note payable. 76 Estimated interest payments Estimated interest payments on our fixed-rate debt and hedged variable-rate debt were calculated based upon contractual interest rates, including the impact of interest rate swap agreements, interest payment dates, and scheduled maturity dates. As of December 31, 2013 , approximately 84% of our debt was fixed-rate debt or variable-rate debt subject to interest rate swap agreements. See additional information regarding our interest rate swap agreements under Liquidity and Capital Resources Contractual Obligations and Commitments Interest Rate Swap Agreements. The remaining 16% of our debt as of December 31, 2013 , was unhedged variable-rate debt based primarily on LIBOR. Interest payments on our unhedged variable-rate debt have been calculated based on interest rates in effect as of December 31, 2013 . See additional information regarding our debt under Note 6, Secured and Unsecured Senior Debt, to our consolidated financial statements appearing in our annual report on Form 10-K for the year ended December 31, 2013 . Interest rate swap agreements We utilize interest rate swap agreements to hedge a portion of our exposure to variable interest rates primarily associated with our unsecured senior line of credit and unsecured senior bank term loans. These agreements involve the receipt of variable-rate amounts from a counterparty in exchange for our payment of fixed-rate amounts to the counterparty over the life of the agreement without the exchange of the underlying notional amount. Interest received under all of our interest rate swap agreements is based on the one-month LIBOR. The net difference between the interest paid and the interest received is reflected as an adjustment to interest expense. We have entered into master derivative agreements with each counterparty. These master derivative agreements (all of which are adapted from the standard International Swaps and Derivatives Association, Inc. form) define certain terms between the Company and each counterparty to address and minimize certain risks associated with our interest rate swap agreements. In order to limit our risk of non-performance by an individual counterparty under our interest rate swap agreements, our interest rate swap agreements are spread among various counterparties. As of December 31, 2013 , the largest aggregate notional amount of the interest rate swap agreements in effect at any single point in time with an individual counterparty was $250.0 million. If one or more of our counterparties fail to perform under our interest rate swap agreements, we may incur higher costs associated with our variable-rate LIBOR-based debt than the interest costs we originally anticipated. We have not posted any collateral related to our interest rate swap agreements. Other resources and liquidity requirements Under our current shelf registration statement filed with the SEC, we may offer common stock, preferred stock, debt, and other securities. These securities may be issued from time to time at our discretion based on our needs and market conditions, including as necessary to balance our use of incremental debt capital. We hold interests, together with certain third parties, in companies that we consolidate in our financial statements. These third parties may contribute equity into these entities primarily related to their share of funds for construction and financing-related activities. Ground lease obligations Ground lease obligations as of December 31, 2013 , included leases for 29 of our properties, which accounted for approximately 16% of our total number of properties, and two land development parcels. Excluding one ground lease related to one operating property that expires in 2036 with a net book value of approximately $8.9 million at December 31, 2013 , our ground lease obligations have remaining lease terms generally ranging from 40 to 100 years, including extension options. A 100% owned subsidiary of the Company previously executed a ground lease, as ground lessee, for certain property in New York City. The West Tower of the Alexandria Center for Life Science New York City is being constructed on such ground-leased property. In November 2012, we commenced vertical construction of the West Tower. The ground lease provides that substantial completion of the West Tower occur by October 31, 2015, and requires satisfying conditions that include substantially completed construction in accordance with the plans. The ground lease also provides that by October 31, 2016, the ground lessee shall obtain a temporary or permanent certificate of occupancy for the core and shell of both the East Tower of the Alexandria Center for Life Science New York City and the West Tower. In each case, the target dates above are subject to force majeure, to contractual cure rights, to other legal remedies available to ground lessees generally, and to change for any reason by agreement between the two parties under the ground lease. All of the required milestones have been met. 77 Commitments As of December 31, 2013 , remaining aggregate costs under contract for the construction of properties undergoing development, redevelopment, and generic life science infrastructure improvements under the terms of leases approximated $272.0 million . We expect payments for these obligations to occur over one to three years, subject to capital planning adjustments from time to time. We are also committed to funding approximately $46.7 million for certain investments over the next several years. In addition, we have letters of credit and performance obligations of $13.9 million primarily related to our construction management requirements. We have minimum development requirements under project development agreements with government entities in some of our future value-creation projects. At December 31, 2013 , we have land and land improvements with an aggregate book value of approximately $18.8 million where we have construction commitment obligations aggregating approximately 300,000 RSF that need to be fulfilled by 2016. The estimated cost to develop these projects will be approximately $115 to $145 per square foot. If we do not meet, extend, or eliminate these commitments, we may default under our existing agreements. The government entities in turn also have certain obligations to us under those project development agreements. We are working with these entities to fulfill or amend certain existing obligations in a mutually beneficial manner. Exposure to environmental liabilities In connection with the acquisition of all of our properties, we have obtained Phase I environmental assessments to ascertain the existence of any environmental liabilities or other issues. The Phase I environmental assessments of our properties have not revealed any environmental liabilities that we believe would have a material adverse effect on our financial condition or results of operations taken as a whole, nor are we aware of any material environmental liabilities that have occurred since the Phase I environmental assessments were completed. In addition, we carry a policy of pollution legal liability insurance covering exposure to certain environmental losses at substantially all of our properties. Cash flows We report and analyze our cash flows based on operating activities, investing activities, and financing activities. The following table summarizes changes in the Company cash flows for the years ended December 31, 2013 and 2012 (in thousands): Year Ended December 31, 2013 2012 Change Net cash provided by operating activities $ 312,727 $ 305,533 $ 7,194 Net cash used in investing activities $ (591,375 ) $ (558,100 ) $ (33,275 ) Net cash provided by financing activities $ 197,570 $ 314,860 $ (117,290 ) Operating activities Cash flows provided by operating activities consisted of the following amounts (in thousands): Year Ended December 31, 2013 2012 Change Net cash provided by operating activities $ 312,727 $ 305,533 $ 7,194 Add back: Changes in operating assets and liabilities 4,785 (15,287 ) 20,072 Net cash provided by operating activities before changes in assets and liabilities $ 317,512 $ 290,246 $ 27,266 78 Cash flows provided by operating activities are primarily dependent on the occupancy level of our asset base, the rental rates of our leases, the collectability of rent and recovery of operating expenses from our tenants, the delivery of development projects, and the timing and delivery of redevelopment projects. Net cash provided by operating activities for the year ended December 31, 2013 , increased to $312.7 million , compared to $305.5 million for the year ended December 31, 2012 . Net cash provided by operating activities before changes in assets and liabilities, for the year ended December 31, 2013 , increased by approximately $27.3 million million, or 9.4% , to $317.5 million , compared to $290.2 million for the year ended December 31, 2012 . This increase was primarily attributable to an increase in our Same Properties cash NOI of approximately $17.3 million , or 5.4% , to $340.8 million for the year ended December 31, 2013 , compared to $323.5 million for the year ended December 31, 2012 . The remainder of our increase in operating cash flow was primarily due to the delivery of significant development and redevelopment projects in 2013. See the Value-Creation Opportunities and External Growth for a summary of key deliveries. Investing activities Net cash used in investing activities for the year ended December 31, 2013 , was $591.4 million , compared to $558.1 million for the year ended December 31, 2012 . This change consisted of the following (in thousands): Year Ended December 31, 2013 2012 Change Proceeds from sales of properties $ 153,968 $ 36,179 $ 117,789 Additions to properties (593,389 ) (549,030 ) (44,359 ) Purchase of properties (122,069 ) (42,171 ) (79,898 ) Other (29,885 ) (3,078 ) (26,807 ) Net cash used in investing activities $ (591,375 ) $ (558,100 ) $ (33,275 ) The change in net cash used in investing activities for the year ended December 31, 2013 , is primarily due to an increase in capital expenditures for construction, including capital expenditures related to our development and redevelopment projects, and a higher investment in property acquisitions during the year ended December 31, 2013 , as compared to the year ended December 31, 2012 , offset by higher proceeds from sales of properties during the year ended December 31, 2013 . For additional information on the acquisition and disposition of real estate assets, see Note 3 to our consolidated financial statements in Item 15 of this report. Value-creation opportunities and external growth As of December 31, 2013 , we had five ground-up development projects in process in North America, including an unconsolidated joint venture development project, aggregating 1,361,463 RSF. We also had one project in North America with 55,213 RSF undergoing conversion into laboratory space through redevelopment. These projects, along with recently delivered projects, certain future projects, and contributions from Same Properties, are expected to contribute significant increases in rental income, NOI, and cash flows. For further discussion, see Sources and Uses of Capital Uses of Capital Summary of Capital Expenditures above. Our initial stabilized yield on a cash basis reflects cash rents at date of stabilization after initial rental concessions, if any, have elapsed. We expect, on average, our cash rents related to our value-creation projects to increase over time pursuant to contractual rent escalations. As of December 31, 2013 , 95% of our leases contained annual rent escalations that were either fixed or based on a consumer price index or another index. During the year ended December 31, 2013 , we executed leases aggregating 896,511 RSF and 277,795 RSF, respectively, related to our development and redevelopment projects. For information on our key deliveries of development and redevelopment projects for the year ended December 31, 2013, see Value-Creation Projects and External Growth located earlier within Item 7 of this report. 79 Financing activities Net cash provided by financing activities for the year ended December 31, 2013 , decreased by $117.3 million , to $197.6 million , compared to $314.9 million for the year ended December 31, 2012 . This decrease consisted of the following amounts (in thousands): Year Ended December 31, 2013 2012 Change Borrowings from secured notes payable $ 28,489 $ 17,810 $ 10,679 Repayments of borrowings from secured notes payable (36,219 ) (26,367 ) (9,852 ) Proceeds from issuance of unsecured senior notes payable 498,561 544,650 (46,089 ) Principal borrowings from unsecured senior line of credit 729,000 847,147 (118,147 ) Repayments of borrowings from unsecured senior line of credit (1,091,000 ) (651,147 ) (439,853 ) Repayments of unsecured senior bank term loan (250,000 ) (250,000 ) Repurchase of unsecured senior convertible notes (384 ) (84,801 ) 84,417 Total changes related to debt (121,553 ) 397,292 (518,845 ) Redemption of Series C Cumulative Redeemable Preferred Stock (129,638 ) 129,638 Proceeds from issuance of Series E Cumulative Redeemable Preferred Stock 124,868 (124,868 ) Total changes related to preferred stock (4,770 ) 4,770 Proceeds from common stock offering 534,469 97,890 436,579 Dividend payments (194,961 ) (154,317 ) (40,644 ) Other (20,385 ) (21,235 ) 850 Net cash provided by financing activities $ 197,570 $ 314,860 $ (117,290 ) Secured construction loans See the Secured construction loans section in Sources and Uses of Capital in Item 7 of this report for details. Debt repayments, refinancing, and losses on early extinguishment of debt During the year ended December 31, 2013 , in conjunction with the refinancing of our unsecured senior bank term loans and the partial repayment of $250.0 million of our 2016 Unsecured Senior Bank Term Loan, we recognized a loss on early extinguishment of debt aggregating $2.0 million , related to the write-off of unamortized loan fees. Dividends We are required to distribute at least 90% of our REIT taxable income on an annual basis in order to continue to qualify as a REIT for federal income tax purposes. Accordingly, we intend to make, but are not contractually bound to make, regular quarterly distributions to preferred and common stockholders from cash flow from operating activities. All such distributions are at the discretion of our Board of Directors. We may be required to use borrowings under our unsecured senior line of credit, if necessary, to meet REIT distribution requirements and maintain our REIT status. We consider market factors and our performance in addition to REIT requirements in determining distribution levels. 80 During the years ended December 31, 2013 and 2012 , we paid the following dividends (in thousands): Year Ended December 31, 2013 2012 Change Common stock dividends $ 169,076 $ 126,498 $ 42,578 Series C Cumulative Redeemable Preferred Stock dividends 5,428 (5,428 ) Series D Cumulative Convertible Preferred Stock dividends 17,500 17,500 Series E Cumulative Redeemable Preferred Stock dividends 8,385 4,891 3,494 $ 194,961 $ 154,317 $ 40,644 The increase in dividends paid on our common stock was primarily due to an increase in the related dividends to $2.49 per common share for the year ended December 31, 2013 , from $2.02 per common share for the year ended December 31, 2012 . The increase was also due to an increase in the number of shares of common stock outstanding to 71.2 million shares as of December 31, 2013 , compared to 63.2 million shares as of December 31, 2012 . Inflation As of December 31, 2013 , approximately 94% of our leases (on an RSF basis) were triple net leases, requiring client tenants to pay substantially all real estate taxes, insurance, utilities, common area expenses, and other operating expenses (including increases thereto) in addition to base rent. Approximately 95% of our leases (on an RSF basis) contained effective annual rent escalations that were either fixed (generally ranging from 3% to 3.5% ) or indexed based on a consumer price index or another index. Accordingly, we do not believe that our cash flow or earnings from real estate operations are subject to any significant risk from inflation. An increase in inflation, however, could result in an increase in the cost of our variable-rate borrowings, including borrowings related to our unsecured senior line of credit and unsecured senior bank term loans. Critical accounting policies Our discussion and analysis of our financial condition and results of operations are based upon our consolidated financial statements, which have been prepared in accordance with GAAP. Our significant accounting policies are described in the notes to our consolidated financial statements appearing elsewhere in this annual report on Form 10-K. The preparation of these financial statements in conformity with GAAP requires us to make estimates, judgments, and assumptions that affect the reported amounts of assets, liabilities, revenues, and expenses. We base these estimates, judgments, and assumptions on historical experience and on various other factors that we believe to be reasonable under the circumstances. Changes in estimates could affect our financial position and specific items in our results of operations that are used by our stockholders, potential investors, industry analysts, and lenders in their evaluation of our performance. Actual results may differ from these estimates under different assumptions or conditions. REIT compliance We have elected to be taxed as a REIT under the Internal Revenue Code. Qualification as a REIT involves the application of highly technical and complex provisions of the Internal Revenue Code to our operations and financial results, and the determination of various factual matters and circumstances not entirely within our control. We believe that our current organization and method of operation comply with the rules and regulations promulgated under the Internal Revenue Code to enable us to qualify, and continue to qualify, as a REIT. However, it is possible that we have been organized or have operated in a manner that would not allow us to qualify as a REIT, or that our future operations could cause us to fail to qualify. If we fail to qualify as a REIT in any taxable year, then we will be required to pay federal income tax (including any applicable alternative minimum tax) on our taxable income at regular corporate rates. If we lose our REIT status, then our net earnings available for investment or distribution to our stockholders will be significantly reduced for each of the years involved and we will no longer be required to make distributions to our stockholders. 81 Investments in real estate, net, and discontinued operations We recognize real estate acquired (including the intangible value of above or below market leases, acquired in-place leases, and other intangible assets or liabilities), liabilities assumed, and any noncontrolling interest in an acquired entity at their fair value as of the acquisition date. If there is a bargain fixed-rate renewal option for the period beyond the non-cancelable lease term, we evaluate factors such as the business conditions in the industry in which the lessee operates, the economic conditions in the area in which the property is located, and the ability of the lessee to sublease the property during the renewal term, in order to determine the likelihood that the lessee will renew. When we determine there is reasonable assurance that such bargain purchase option will be exercised, we consider its impact in determining the intangible value of such lease and its related amortization period. The value of tangible assets acquired is based upon our estimation of value on an as if vacant basis. The value of acquired in-place leases includes the estimated costs during the hypothetical lease-up period and other costs that would have been incurred to execute similar leases, considering market conditions at the acquisition date of the acquired in-place lease. We assess the fair value of tangible and intangible assets based on numerous factors, including estimated cash flow projections that utilize appropriate discount and capitalization rates and available market information. Estimates of future cash flows are based on a number of factors, including the historical operating results, known trends, and market/economic conditions that may affect the property. We also recognize the fair values of assets acquired, the liabilities assumed, and any noncontrolling interest in acquisitions of less than a 100% interest when the acquisition constitutes a change in control of the acquired entity. Acquisition-related costs related to the acquisition of businesses, including real estate acquired with in-place leases, are expensed as incurred. The values allocated to land improvements, tenant improvements, equipment, buildings, and building improvements are depreciated on a straight-line basis using an estimated life of 20 years for land improvements, the respective lease term for tenant improvements, the estimated useful life for equipment, and the shorter of the term of the respective ground lease and up to 40 years for buildings and building improvements. The values of acquired above and below market leases are amortized over the lives of the related leases and recognized as either an increase (for below market leases) or a decrease (for above market leases) to rental income. The values of acquired in-place leases are classified in other assets in the accompanying consolidated balance sheets, and amortized over the remaining terms of the related leases. A property is classified as held for sale when all of the following criteria for a plan of sale have been met: (i) management, having the authority to approve the action, commits to a plan to sell the property; (ii) the property is available for immediate sale in its present condition, subject only to terms that are usual and customary; (iii) an active program to locate a buyer and other actions required to complete the plan to sell have been initiated; (iv) the sale of the property is probable and is expected to be completed within one year; (v) the property is being actively marketed for sale at a price that is reasonable in relation to its current fair value; and (vi) actions necessary to complete the plan of sale indicate that it is unlikely that significant changes to the plan will be made or that the plan will be withdrawn. When all of these criteria have been met, the property is classified as held for sale ; and if (i) the operations and cash flows of the property have been or will be eliminated from the ongoing operations, and (ii) we will not have any significant continuing involvement in the operations of the property after the sale, then its operations, including any interest expense directly attributable to it, are classified as discontinued operations in our consolidated statements of income; and amounts for all prior periods presented are reclassified from continuing operations to discontinued operations. Depreciation of assets ceases upon designation of a property as held for sale. Impairment of long-lived assets Long-lived assets to be held and used, including our rental properties, land held for future development, construction in progress, and intangibles, are individually evaluated for impairment when conditions indicate that the amount of a long-lived asset may not be recoverable. Impairment indicators or triggering events for long-lived assets to be held and used, including our rental properties, land held for future development, and construction in progress, are assessed by project and include, but are not limited to, significantly adverse changes in NOI, vacancy, operating losses, cash flow losses, construction costs, estimated completion dates, rental rates, or previously unknown and materially adverse environmental matters, among other factors. The amount of a long-lived asset to be held and used is not recoverable if it exceeds the sum of the undiscounted cash flows expected to result from the use and eventual disposition of the asset. We assess the expected undiscounted cash flows based on our latest estimates of current and future economic conditions that may affect the property whenever indicators of impairment are present. Upon determination that an impairment has occurred, a write-down is recognized to reduce the carrying amount to its estimated fair value. If an impairment loss is not required to be recognized, the recognition of depreciation is adjusted prospectively, as necessary, to reduce the carrying amount of the real estate to its estimated disposition value over the remaining period that the real estate is expected to be held and used. We may adjust depreciation of properties that are expected to be disposed of or redeveloped prior to the end of their useful lives. 82 We use the held for sale impairment model for our properties classified as held for sale. The held for sale impairment model is different from the held and used impairment model. Under the held for sale impairment model, an impairment loss is recognized if the amount of the long-lived asset classified as held for sale exceeds its fair value less cost to sell. Because of these two different models, it is possible for a long-lived asset previously classified as held and used to require the recognition of an impairment charge upon classification as held for sale. Capitalization of costs We are required to capitalize project costs, including predevelopment costs, interest, property taxes, insurance, and other costs directly related and essential to the acquisition, development, redevelopment, or construction of a project. Capitalization of development, redevelopment, and construction costs is required while activities are ongoing to prepare an asset for its intended use. Costs incurred after a project is substantially complete and ready for its intended use are expensed as incurred. Should development, redevelopment, or construction activity cease, interest, property taxes, insurance, and certain other costs would no longer be eligible for capitalization and would be expensed as incurred. Expenditures for repairs and maintenance and demolition are expensed as incurred. Fluctuations in our development, redevelopment, and construction activities could result in significant changes to total expenses and net income. For example, had we experienced a 10% reduction in construction, development, and redevelopment activities without a corresponding decrease in indirect project costs, including interest and payroll, total expenses would have increased by approximately $7.7 million for the year ended December 31, 2013 . We also capitalize costs directly related and essential to our leasing activities. These costs are amortized on a straight-line basis over the terms of the related leases. Costs related to unsuccessful leasing opportunities are expensed as incurred. Acquisition costs related to business acquisitions, including real estate acquired with in-place leases and abandoned projects, are expensed as incurred. These costs are classified as general and administrative expense in the accompanying consolidated statements of income. During the three months ended December 31, 2013 , we incurred approximately $1.4 million of acquisition related costs, including abandoned projects. We completed acquisitions in November 2013 and January 2014 for an aggregate purchase price of $166.8 million. See Subsequent Events in the notes to consolidated financial statements under Item 15 to this report on Form 10-K. These amounts aggregated approximately $1.1 million, and $1.0 million for the years ended December 31, 2012 and 2011 , respectively. Investments We hold equity investments in certain publicly traded companies and privately held entities primarily involved in the life science industry. All of our investments in actively traded public companies are considered available for sale and are reflected in the accompanying consolidated balance sheets at fair value. Fair value has been determined based upon the closing price as of each balance sheet date, with unrealized gains and losses shown as a separate component of comprehensive income. The classification of each investment is determined at the time each investment is made, and such determination is reevaluated at each balance sheet date. The cost of each investment sold is determined by the specific identification method, with realized gains or losses classified in other income in the accompanying consolidated balance sheets. Investments in privately held entities are generally accounted for under the cost method when our interest in the entity is so minor that we have virtually no influence over the entity operating and financial policies. Certain investments in privately held entities are accounted for under the equity method when our interest in the entity is not deemed so minor that we have virtually no influence over the entity operating and financial policies. Under the equity method of accounting, we recognize our investment initially at cost and adjust the amount of the investment to recognize our share of the earnings or losses of the investee subsequent to the date of our investment. Additionally, we limit our ownership percentage in the voting stock of each individual entity to less than 10%. As of December 31, 2013 and 2012 , our ownership was in compliance with this limit. Individual investments are evaluated for impairment when changes in conditions may indicate an impairment exists. The factors that we consider in making these assessments include market prices, market conditions, available financing, prospects for favorable or unfavorable clinical trial results, new product initiatives, and new collaborative agreements. If there are no identified events or changes in circumstances that would have an adverse effect on our cost method investments, we do not estimate their fair value. For all of our investments, if a decline in the fair value of an investment below the carrying value is determined to be other than temporary, such investment is written down to its estimated fair value with a non-cash charge to current earnings. We measure and disclose the estimated fair value of individual investments utilizing a fair value hierarchy that distinguishes between data obtained from sources independent from us and our own assumptions about individual investments. For a description of the methodology we use to determine the fair value of privately held entities, refer to Note 9, Fair Value Measurements. 83 Interest rate swap agreements We are exposed to certain risks arising from both our business operations and economic conditions. We principally manage our exposures to a wide variety of business and operational risks through management of our core business activities. We manage economic risks, including interest rate, liquidity, and credit risk, primarily by managing the amount, sources, and duration of our debt funding and the use of interest rate swap agreements. Specifically, we enter into interest rate swap agreements to manage exposures that arise from business activities that result in the payment of future known and uncertain cash amounts, the value of which are determined by interest rates. Our interest rate swap agreements are used to manage differences in the amount, timing, and duration of our known or expected cash payments principally related to our borrowings based on LIBOR. We do not use derivatives for trading or speculative purposes, and currently all of our derivatives are designated as hedges. Our objectives in using interest rate swap agreements are to add stability to interest expense and to manage our exposure to interest rate movements in accordance with our interest rate risk management strategy. Interest rate swap agreements designated as cash flow hedges involve the receipt of variable-rate amounts from a counterparty in exchange for the Company making fixed-rate payments over the life of the interest rate swap agreements without exchange of the underlying notional amount of the interest rate swap agreements. We utilize interest rate swap agreements to hedge a portion of our exposure to variable interest rates primarily associated with our unsecured senior line of credit and unsecured senior bank term loans. We recognize our interest rate swap agreements as either assets or liabilities on the balance sheet at fair value. The accounting for changes in fair value (i.e., gains or losses) of a derivative instrument depends on whether it has been designated and qualifies as part of a hedging relationship and, further, on the type of hedging relationship. For those derivative instruments that are designated and qualify as hedging instruments, a company must designate the hedging instrument, based on the hedged exposure, as a fair value hedge, a cash flow hedge, or a hedge of a net investment in a foreign operation. Our interest rate swap agreements are considered cash flow hedges as they are designated and qualify as hedges of the exposure to variability in expected future cash flows. Hedge accounting generally provides for the matching of the timing of gain or loss recognition on the hedging instrument with the recognition of the changes in the earnings effect of the hedged transactions in a cash flow hedge. All of our interest rate swap agreements meet the criteria to be deemed highly effective in reducing our exposure to variable interest rates. We formally document all relationships between interest rate swap agreements and hedged items, including the method for evaluating effectiveness and the risk strategy. We make an assessment at the inception of each interest rate swap agreement and on an ongoing basis to determine whether these instruments are highly effective in offsetting changes in cash flows associated with the hedged items. The ineffective portion of each interest rate swap agreement is immediately recognized in earnings. While we intend to continue to meet the conditions for such hedge accounting, if swaps did not qualify as highly effective, the changes in the fair values of the derivatives used as hedges would be reflected in earnings. The effective portion of changes in the fair value of our interest rate swap agreements that are designated and that qualify as cash flow hedges is recognized in accumulated other comprehensive income. Amounts classified in accumulated other comprehensive income will be reclassified into earnings in the period during which the hedged transactions affect earnings. The fair value of each interest rate swap agreement is determined using widely accepted valuation techniques including discounted cash flow analyses on the expected cash flows of each derivative. These analyses reflect the contractual terms of the derivatives, including the period to maturity, and use observable market-based inputs, including interest rate curves and implied volatilities (also referred to as significant other observable inputs ). The fair values of our interest rate swap agreements are determined using the market standard methodology of netting the discounted future fixed cash payments and the discounted expected variable cash receipts. The variable cash receipts are based on an expectation of future interest rates (forward curves) derived from observable market interest rate curves. The fair value calculation also includes an amount for risk of non-performance using significant unobservable inputs such as estimates of current credit spreads to evaluate the likelihood of default, which we have determined to be insignificant to the overall fair value of our interest rate swap agreements. Recognition of rental income and tenant recoveries Rental income from leases is recognized on a straight-line basis over the respective lease terms. We classify amounts currently recognized as income, and expected to be received in later years, as an asset in deferred rent in the accompanying consolidated balance sheets. Amounts received currently, but recognized as income in future years, are classified in accounts payable, accrued expenses, and tenant security deposits in the accompanying consolidated balance sheets. We commence recognition of rental income at the date the property is ready for its intended use and the client tenant takes possession of or controls the physical use of the property. Tenant recoveries related to reimbursement of real estate taxes, insurance, utilities, repairs and maintenance, and other operating expenses are recognized as revenue in the period during which the applicable expenses are incurred. 84 Tenant receivables consist primarily of amounts due for contractual lease payments, reimbursements of common area maintenance expenses, property taxes, and other expenses recoverable from client tenants. Tenant receivables are expected to be collected within one year . We may maintain an allowance for estimated losses that may result from the inability of our client tenants to make payments required under the terms of the lease and for tenant recoveries due. If a client tenant fails to make contractual payments beyond any allowance, we may recognize additional bad debt expense in future periods equal to the amount of uncollectible rent and deferred rent receivables arising from the straight-lining of rent. As of December 31, 2013 and 2012 , we had no allowance for estimated losses. As of December 31, 2013 , approximately 94% of our leases (on an RSF basis) were triple net leases, requiring client tenants to pay substantially all real estate taxes, insurance, utilities, common area expenses, and other operating expenses (including increases thereto) in addition to base rent. Approximately 95% of our leases (on an RSF basis) contained effective annual rent escalations that were either fixed or based on a consumer price index or another index. Additionally, approximately 92% of our leases (on an RSF basis) provided for the recapture of certain capital expenditures. Monitoring client tenant credit quality During the term of each lease, we monitor the credit quality of our client tenants by (i) reviewing the credit rating of tenants that are rated by a nationally recognized credit rating agency, (ii) reviewing financial statements of the client tenants that are publicly available or that are required to be delivered to us pursuant to the applicable lease, (iii) monitoring news reports regarding our tenants and their respective businesses, and (iv) monitoring the timeliness of lease payments. We have a team of employees who, among them, have graduate and undergraduate degrees in biology, chemistry, and industrial biotechnology and experience in the life science industry, as well as in finance. This life science research team is responsible for assessing and monitoring the credit quality of our tenants and any material changes in credit quality. Non-GAAP measures Funds from operations and funds from operations, as adjusted GAAP basis accounting for real estate assets utilizes historical cost accounting and assumes that real estate values diminish over time. In an effort to overcome the difference between real estate values and historical cost accounting for real estate assets, the Board of Governors of the National Association of Real Estate Investment Trusts ( NAREIT ) established the measurement tool of FFO. Since its introduction, FFO has become a widely used non-GAAP financial measure among equity REITs. We believe that FFO is helpful to investors as an additional measure of the performance of an equity REIT. Moreover, we believe that FFO, as adjusted, is also helpful because it allows investors to compare our performance to the performance of other real estate companies between periods, and on a consistent basis, without having to account for differences caused by investment and disposition decisions, financing decisions, terms of securities, capital structures, and capital market transactions. We compute FFO in accordance with standards established by the Board of Governors of NAREIT in its April 2002 White Paper and related implementation guidance ( NAREIT White Paper ). The NAREIT White Paper defines FFO as net income (computed in accordance with GAAP), excluding gains (losses) from sales of depreciable real estate and land parcels and impairments of depreciable real estate (excluding land parcels), plus real estate related depreciation and amortization, and after adjustments for unconsolidated partnerships and joint ventures. Impairments of real estate relate to decreases in the estimated fair value of real estate due to changes in general market conditions and do not necessarily reflect the operating performance of the properties during the corresponding period. Impairments of real estate represent the write-down of assets when fair value over the recoverability period is less than the carrying value. We compute FFO, as adjusted, as FFO calculated in accordance with the NAREIT White Paper, plus losses on early extinguishment of debt, preferred stock redemption charges, impairments of land parcels, impairments of investments, and deal costs less realized gain on equity investment primarily related to one non-tenant life science entity, and the amount of such items that is allocable to our unvested restricted stock awards. Our calculations of both FFO and FFO, as adjusted, may differ from those methodologies utilized by other equity REITs for similar performance measurements, and, accordingly, may not be comparable to those of other equity REITs. Neither FFO nor FFO, as adjusted, should be considered as an alternative to net income (determined in accordance with GAAP) as an indication of financial performance, or to cash flows from operating activities (determined in accordance with GAAP) as a measure of liquidity, nor are they indicative of the availability of funds for our cash needs, including funds available to make distributions. 85 Adjusted funds from operations AFFO is a non-GAAP financial measure that we use as a supplemental measure of our performance. We compute AFFO by adding to or deducting from FFO, as adjusted: (i) non-revenue-enhancing building improvements (excluding amounts recoverable from our client tenants), non-revenue-enhancing tenant improvements and leasing commissions (excludes revenue-enhancing and development and redevelopment expenditures); (ii) effects of straight-line rent and straight-line rent on ground leases; (iii) capitalized income from development projects; (iv) amortization of acquired above and below market leases, loan fees, and debt premiums/discounts; (v) stock compensation expense; and (vi) allocation of AFFO attributable to unvested restricted stock awards. We believe that AFFO is a useful supplemental performance measure because it further adjusts to: (i) deduct certain expenditures that, although capitalized and classified in depreciation expense, do not enhance the revenue or cash flows of our properties; (ii) eliminate the effect of straight-lining our rental income and capitalizing income from development projects; and (iii) eliminate the effect of items that are not indicative of our core operations and that do not actually reduce the amount of cash generated by our operations. We believe that eliminating the effect of charges related to share-based compensation facilitates a comparison of our operations across periods and among other equity REITs without the variances caused by different valuation methodologies, the volatility of the expense (which depends on market forces outside our control), and the assumptions and the variety of award types that a company can use. We believe that AFFO provides useful information by excluding certain items that are not representative of our core operating results because such items are dependent upon historical costs or subject to judgmental valuation inputs and the timing of our decisions. AFFO is not intended to represent cash flow for the period, and is intended only to provide an additional measure of performance. We believe that net income attributable to Alexandria common stockholders is the most directly comparable GAAP financial measure to AFFO. We believe that AFFO is a widely recognized measure of the operations of equity REITs, and presenting AFFO will enable investors to assess our performance in comparison to other equity REITs. However, other equity REITs may use different methodologies for calculating AFFO and, accordingly, our AFFO may not be comparable to AFFO calculated by other equity REITs. AFFO should not be considered as an alternative to net income (determined in accordance with GAAP) as an indication of financial performance, or to cash flows from operating activities (determined in accordance with GAAP) as a measure of our liquidity, nor is it indicative of funds available to fund our cash needs, including our ability to make distributions. 86 The following table presents a reconciliation of net income attributable to Alexandria common stockholders basic, the most directly comparable financial measure calculated and presented in accordance with GAAP, to FFO attributable to Alexandria common stockholders basic, FFO attributable to Alexandria common stockholders diluted, as adjusted, and AFFO attributable to Alexandria common stockholders diluted, for the periods below (in thousands): Year Ended December 31, 2013 2012 2011 Net income attributable to Alexandria common stockholders basic $ 108,751 $ 67,630 $ 101,973 Depreciation and amortization 190,778 192,005 158,026 (Gain) loss on sale of real estate 121 (1,564 ) Impairment of real estate 11,400 994 Gain on sale of land parcel (4,824 ) (1,864 ) (46 ) Amount attributable to noncontrolling interests/unvested restricted stock awards: Net income 5,613 4,592 5,063 FFO (5,577 ) (4,561 ) (6,402 ) FFO attributable to Alexandria common stockholders basic 294,862 267,638 259,608 Assumed conversion of 8.00% unsecured senior convertible notes 15 21 21 FFO attributable to Alexandria common stockholders diluted 294,877 267,659 259,629 Realized gain on equity investment primarily related to one non-tenant life science entity (5,811 ) Impairment of land parcel 2,050 Impairment of investments 853 Acquisition-related expenses 1,446 Loss on early extinguishment of debt 1,992 2,225 6,485 Preferred stock redemption charge 5,978 Allocation to unvested restricted stock awards (35 ) (39 ) (69 ) FFO attributable to Alexandria common stockholders diluted, as adjusted 299,133 272,062 266,045 Non-revenue-enhancing capital expenditures: Building improvements (3,461 ) (2,068 ) (2,531 ) Tenant improvements and leasing commissions (15,902 ) (9,181 ) (10,600 ) Straight-line rent revenue (27,935 ) (28,456 ) (26,797 ) Straight-line rent expense on ground leases 1,896 3,285 4,704 Capitalized income from development projects 143 645 3,973 Amortization of acquired above and below market leases (3,316 ) (3,200 ) (9,332 ) Amortization of loan fees 9,936 9,832 9,300 Amortization of debt premiums/discounts 529 511 3,819 Stock compensation 15,552 14,160 11,755 Allocation to unvested restricted stock awards 191 127 122 AFFO attributable to Alexandria common stockholders diluted $ 276,766 $ 257,717 $ 250,458 87 The following table presents a reconciliation of net income per share attributable to Alexandria common stockholders basic, to FFO per share attributable to Alexandria common stockholders diluted, FFO per share attributable to Alexandria common stockholders diluted, as adjusted, and AFFO per share attributable to Alexandria common stockholders diluted, for the periods below.

We use adjusted EBITDA ( Adjusted EBITDA ) to assess the performance of our core operations, for financial and operational decision making, and as a supplemental or additional means of evaluating period-to-period comparisons on a consistent basis. Adjusted EBITDA is calculated as EBITDA, excluding stock compensation expense, gains or losses on early extinguishment of debt, gains or losses on sales of real estate and land parcels, deal costs, and impairments. We believe Adjusted EBITDA provides investors relevant and useful information because it permits investors to view income from our operations on an unleveraged basis before the effects of taxes, depreciation and amortization, stock compensation expense, gains or losses on early extinguishment of debt, gains or losses on sales of real estate and land parcels, deal costs, and impairments. By excluding interest expense and gains or losses on early extinguishment of debt, EBITDA and Adjusted EBITDA allow investors to measure our performance independent of our capital structure and indebtedness and, therefore, allow for a more meaningful comparison of our performance to that of other companies, both in the real estate industry and in other industries. We believe that excluding charges related to share-based compensation facilitates a comparison of our operations across periods and among other equity REITs without the variances caused by different valuation methodologies, the volatility of the expense (which depends on market forces outside our control), and the assumptions and the variety of award types that a company can use. We believe that adjusting for the effects of gains or losses on sales of real estate and land parcels, deal costs, and impairments provides useful information by excluding certain items that are not representative of our core operating results. These items are dependent upon historical costs, and are subject to judgmental inputs and the timing of our decisions. EBITDA and Adjusted EBITDA have limitations as measures of our performance. EBITDA and Adjusted EBITDA do not reflect our historical cash expenditures or future cash requirements for capital expenditures or contractual commitments. While EBITDA and Adjusted EBITDA are relevant and widely used measures of performance, they do not represent net income or cash flows from operations as defined by GAAP, and they should not be considered as alternatives to those indicators in evaluating performance or liquidity. Further, our computation of EBITDA and Adjusted EBITDA may not be comparable to similar measures reported by other companies. The following table reconciles net income, the most directly comparable financial measure calculated and presented in accordance with GAAP, to EBITDA, and Adjusted EBITDA (in thousands): Three Months Ended December 31, Year Ended December 31, 2013 2012 2013 2012 Net income $ 44,222 $ 28,807 $ 140,249 $ 105,528 Interest expense 17,783 17,941 67,952 69,184 Depreciation and amortization continuing operations 48,084 47,280 189,123 185,687 Depreciation and amortization discontinued operations 17 792 1,655 6,318 EBITDA 110,106 94,820 398,979 366,717 Stock compensation expense 4,011 3,748 15,552 14,160 Loss on early extinguishment of debt 1,992 2,225 (Gain) loss on sale of real estate 121 (1,564 ) Gain on sale of land parcel (4,052 ) (4,824 ) (1,864 ) Impairment of real estate 1,601 11,400 Impairment of land parcel 2,050 2,050 Impairment of investments 853 853 Deal costs 1,446 1,446 Adjusted EBITDA $ 112,364 $ 102,219 $ 414,119 $ 393,124 89 Adjusted EBITDA margins We calculate Adjusted EBITDA margins by dividing Adjusted EBITDA by total revenues. Because our total revenues exclude revenues from discontinued operations, for the purposes of calculating the margin ratio, we exclude the Adjusted EBITDA generated by our discontinued operations for each period presented. We believe excluding Adjusted EBITDA for discontinued operations improves the consistency and comparability of the Adjusted EBITDA margins from period to period. The following table reconciles Adjusted EBITDA to Adjusted EBITDA excluding discontinued operations (dollars in thousands): Three Months Ended December 31, Year Ended December 31, 2013 2012 2013 2012 Adjusted EBITDA $ 112,364 $ 102,219 $ 414,119 $ 393,124 Less: discontinued operations 126 (5,982 ) (2,676 ) (24,970 ) Adjusted EBITDA excluding discontinued operations $ 112,490 $ 96,237 $ 411,443 $ 368,154 Total revenues $ 168,823 $ 151,254 $ 631,151 $ 574,497 Adjusted EBITDA margins 67% 64% 65% 64% Fixed charge coverage ratio The fixed charge coverage ratio is the ratio of Adjusted EBITDA to fixed charges. This ratio is useful to investors as a supplemental measure of our ability to satisfy financing obligations and preferred stock dividends. Cash interest is equal to interest expense calculated in accordance with GAAP, plus capitalized interest, less amortization of loan fees and amortization of debt premiums/discounts. The fixed charge coverage ratio calculation below is not directly comparable to the computation of Consolidated Ratio of Earnings to Fixed Charges and Consolidated Ratio of Earnings to Combined Fixed Charges and Preferred Stock Dividends included in Exhibit 12.1 to our annual report on Form 10-K, as of December 31, 2013 . The following table presents a reconciliation of interest expense, the most directly comparable GAAP financial measure to cash interest and fixed charges (dollars in thousands): Three Months Ended December 31, Year Ended December 31, 2013 2012 2013 2012 Adjusted EBITDA $ 112,364 $ 102,219 $ 414,119 $ 393,124 Interest expense $ 17,783 $ 17,941 $ 67,952 $ 69,184 Add: capitalized interest 14,116 14,897 60,615 62,751 Less: amortization of loan fees (2,636 ) (2,505 ) (9,936 ) (9,832 ) Less: amortization of debt premium/discounts (146 ) (110 ) (529 ) (511 ) Cash interest 29,117 30,223 118,102 121,592 Dividends on preferred stock 6,471 6,471 25,885 27,328 Fixed charges $ 35,588 $ 36,694 $ 143,987 $ 148,920 Fixed charge coverage ratio quarter annualized 3.2x 2.8x 2.9 x 2.6 x Fixed charge coverage ratio trailing 12 months 2.9x 2.6x 2.9 x 2.6 x 90 Net debt to Adjusted EBITDA Net debt to Adjusted EBITDA is a non-GAAP financial measure that we believe is useful to investors as a supplemental measure in evaluating our balance sheet leverage. Net debt is equal to the sum of total consolidated debt less cash, cash equivalents, and restricted cash. See Adjusted EBITDA for further information on the calculation of Adjusted EBITDA. The following table summarizes the calculation of net debt to Adjusted EBITDA as of December 31, 2013 and 2012 (dollars in thousands): As of December 31, 2013 2012 Secured notes payable $ 708,831 $ 716,144 Unsecured senior notes payable 1,048,230 549,805 Unsecured senior line of credit 204,000 566,000 Unsecured senior bank term loans 1,100,000 1,350,000 Less: cash and cash equivalents (57,696 ) (140,971 ) Less: restricted cash (27,709 ) (39,947 ) Net debt $ 2,975,656 $ 3,001,031 Adjusted EBITDA quarter annualized (1) $ 449,456 $ 408,876 Net debt to Adjusted EBITDA quarter annualized (1) 6.6 x 7.3 x Adjusted EBITDA trailing 12 months $ 414,119 $ 393,124 Net debt to Adjusted EBITDA trailing 12 months 7.2 x 7.6 x (1) We believe the Adjusted EBITDA and net debt to Adjusted EBITDA for the three months ended December 31, 2013 and 2012, annualized, reflect the completion of many development and redevelopment projects and are indicative of the Company current operating trends. NOI NOI is a non-GAAP financial measure equal to income from continuing operations, the most directly comparable GAAP financial measure, excluding loss (gain) on early extinguishment of debt, impairment of land parcel, depreciation and amortization, interest expense, and general and administrative expense. We believe NOI provides useful information to investors regarding our financial condition and results of operations because it primarily reflects those income and expense items that are incurred at the property level. Therefore, we believe NOI is a useful measure for evaluating the operating performance of our real estate assets. NOI on a cash basis is NOI on a GAAP basis, adjusted to exclude the effect of straight-line rent adjustments required by GAAP. We believe that NOI on a cash basis is helpful to investors as an additional measure of operating performance because it eliminates straight-line rent adjustments to rental revenue. Further, we believe NOI is useful to investors as a performance measure, because when compared across periods, NOI reflects the impact on operations from trends in occupancy rates, rental rates, and operating costs, providing perspective not immediately apparent from income from continuing operations. NOI excludes certain components from income from continuing operations in order to provide results that are more closely related to the results of operations of our properties. For example, interest expense is not necessarily linked to the operating performance of a real estate asset and is often incurred at the corporate level rather than at the property level. In addition, depreciation and amortization, because of historical cost accounting and useful life estimates, may distort operating performance at the property level. Real estate impairments have been excluded in deriving NOI because we do not consider impairment losses to be property-level operating expenses. Real estate impairment losses relate to changes in the values of our assets and do not reflect the current operating performance with respect to related revenues or expenses. Our real estate impairments represent the write-down in the value of the assets to the estimated fair value less cost to sell. These impairments result from investing decisions and the deterioration in market conditions that adversely impact underlying real estate values. Our calculation of NOI also excludes charges incurred from changes in certain financing decisions, such as losses on early extinguishment of debt, as these charges often relate to the timing of corporate strategy. Property operating expenses that are included in determining NOI consist of costs that are related to our operating properties, such as utilities, repairs and maintenance, rental expense related to ground leases, contracted services, such as janitorial, engineering, and landscaping, property taxes and insurance, and property-level salaries. General and administrative expenses consist primarily of accounting and corporate compensation, corporate insurance, 91 professional fees, office rent, and office supplies that are incurred as part of corporate office management. NOI presented by us may not be comparable to NOI reported by other equity REITs that define NOI differently. We believe that in order to facilitate a clear understanding of our operating results, NOI should be examined in conjunction with income from continuing operations as presented in our condensed consolidated statements of income. NOI should not be considered as an alternative to income from continuing operations as an indication of our performance, or as an alternative to cash flows as a measure of liquidity or our ability to make distributions. Same Property NOI See discussion of Same Properties and reconciliation of NOI to income from continuing operations in Results of Operations. Unencumbered NOI as a percentage of total NOI Unencumbered NOI as a percentage of total NOI is a non-GAAP financial measure that we believe is useful to investors as a performance measure of our results of operations of our unencumbered real estate assets, as it primarily reflects those income and expense items that are incurred at the unencumbered property level. We use unencumbered NOI as a percentage of total NOI in order to assess our compliance with our financial covenants under our debt obligations because the measure serves as a proxy for a financial measure under such debt obligations. Unencumbered NOI is derived from assets classified in continuing operations that are not subject to any mortgage, deed of trust, lien, or other security interest as of the period for which income is presented. Unencumbered NOI for periods prior to the three months ended December 31, 2013 , has been reclassified to conform to current period presentation related to discontinued operations. See the reconciliation of NOI to income from continuing operations in Results of Operations. The following table summarizes unencumbered NOI as a percentage of total NOI for the years ended December 31, 2013 and 2012 (dollars in thousands): Year Ended December 31, 2013 2012 Unencumbered NOI $ 305,028 $ 286,224 Encumbered NOI 137,084 115,517 Total NOI from continuing operations $ 442,112 $ 401,741 Unencumbered NOI as a percentage of total NOI 69 % 71 % 92
