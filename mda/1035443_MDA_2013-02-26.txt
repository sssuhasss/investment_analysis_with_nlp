ITEM 7. MANAGEMENT S DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS OF FINANCIAL CONDITION AND RESULTS OF OPERATIONS The following discussion should be read in conjunction with our consolidated financial statements and notes thereto appearing elsewhere in this annual report on Form 10-K. Forward-looking statements involve inherent risks and uncertainties regarding events, conditions, and financial trends that may affect our future plans of operation, business strategy, results of operations, and financial position. A number of important factors could cause actual results to differ materially from those included within or contemplated by such forward-looking statements, including, but not limited to, those described under Item 1. Business in this annual report on Form 10-K. We do not undertake any responsibility to update any of these factors or to announce publicly any revisions to any of the forward-looking statements contained in this or any other document, whether as a result of new information, future events, or otherwise. Overview We are a Maryland corporation formed in October 1994 that has elected to be taxed as a REIT for federal income tax purposes. We are the largest owner, preeminent REIT, and leading life science real estate company focused principally on science-driven cluster development through the ownership, operation, management, selective acquisition, development, and redevelopment of properties containing life science laboratory space. We are the leading provider of high-quality environmentally sustainable real estate, technical infrastructure, and services to the broad and diverse life science industry. Client tenants include leading multinational pharmaceutical companies, academic and medical institutions, public and private biotechnology entities, U.S. government research agencies, medical device companies, industrial biotech companies, venture capital firms, and life science product and service companies. Our primary business objective is to maximize stakeholder value by providing our debt and equity stakeholders with the greatest possible total return based on a multifaceted platform of internal and external growth. Our operating platform is based on the principle of clustering, with assets and operations located adjacent to life science entities, and in close proximity to concentrations of specialized skills, knowledge, institutions, and related businesses, driving growth and technological advances within each cluster. Our average occupancy rate of operating properties as of December 31 of each year from 2000 to 2012 was approximately 95.0%. Our average occupancy rate of operating and redevelopment properties as of December 31 of each year from 2000 to 2012 was approximately 88.8%. Investment-grade client tenants represented 47% of our total annualized base rent as of December 31, 2012. Results Core operations The key elements to our strategy include our consistent focus on high-quality assets and operations in the top life science cluster locations with our properties located adjacent to life science entities, driving growth and technological advances within each cluster. These adjacency locations are characterized by high barriers to entry for new landlords, high barriers to exit for client tenants, limited supply of available space, and represent highly desirable locations for tenancy by life science entities because of the close proximity to concentrations of specialized skills, knowledge, institutions, and related businesses. Our strategy also includes drawing upon our deep and broad life science and real estate relationships in order to attract new and leading life science client tenants and value-added real estate. 50 Table of Contents The following table presents information regarding our asset base and value-added projects as of December 31, 2012, 2011, and 2010: December 31, Rentable square feet 2012 2011 2010 Rentable square feet of operating properties 14,953,968 13,583,993 12,445,754 Development properties 1,566,774 818,020 475,818 Redevelopment properties 547,092 919,857 755,463 Rentable square feet of total properties 17,067,834 15,321,870 13,677,035 Number of properties 178 173 167 Occupancy operating 93.4% 94.9% 94.3% Occupancy operating and redevelopment 89.8% 88.5% 88.9% Annualized base rent per leased rentable square foot $ 34.59 $ 34.39 $ 33.95 Leasing For the year ended December 31, 2012, we executed a total of 187 leases for approximately 3,281,000 rentable square feet at 84 different properties (excluding month-to-month leases). Of this total, approximately 1,475,000 rentable square feet related to new or renewal leases of previously leased space (renewed/re-leased space), and approximately 1,806,000 rentable square feet related to developed, redeveloped, or previously vacant space. Of the 1,806,000 rentable square feet, approximately 1,135,000 rentable square feet related to our development or redevelopment programs, and the remaining approximately 671,000 rentable square feet related to previously vacant space. Rental rates for this renewed/re-leased space were, on average, approximately 2.0% lower on a cash basis and approximately 5.2% higher on a GAAP basis than rental rates for the respective expiring leases. Additionally, we granted tenant concessions, including free rent averaging approximately 1.6 months, with respect to the 3,281,000 rentable square feet leased during the year ended December 31, 2012. Approximately 71% of the number of leases executed during the year ended December 31, 2012, did not include concessions for free rent. Weighted average lease term for the leases executed during the year ended December 31, 2012, was 7.1 years. As of December 31, 2012, approximately 94% of our leases (on a rentable square footage basis) were triple net leases, requiring client tenants to pay substantially all real estate taxes, insurance, utilities, common area expenses, and other operating expenses (including increases thereto) in addition to base rent. Additionally, approximately 96% of our leases (on a rentable square footage basis) contained effective annual rent escalations that were either fixed or indexed based on a consumer price index or another index, and approximately 92% of our leases (on a rentable square footage basis) provided for the recapture of certain capital expenditures. The following chart presents development/redevelopment space leased and renewed/re-leased/previously vacant space leased: 51 Table of Contents Value-added opportunities and external growth As of December 31, 2012, we had six ground-up development projects in process aggregating approximately 1,566,774 rentable square feet. We also had 10 projects undergoing conversion into laboratory space through redevelopment aggregating approximately 547,092 rentable square feet. These projects, along with recently delivered projects, certain future projects, and contribution from same properties, are expected to contribute significant increases in rental income, net operating income, and cash flows. As of December 31, 2012, 96% of our leases contained annual rent escalations that were either fixed or based on a consumer price index or another index. Our initial stabilized yield on a cash basis reflects cash rents at date of stabilization and does not reflect contractual rent escalations beyond the stabilization date. We expect, on average, our contractual cash rents related to our value-added projects to increase over time. Initial stabilized yield is calculated as the quotient of the estimated amounts of net operating income and our investment in the property at stabilization ( Initial Stabilized Yield ). During the year ended December 31, 2012, we executed leases aggregating 699,000 and 436,000 rentable square feet, respectively, related to our development and redevelopment projects.

ARIAD Pharmaceuticals, Inc. leased 100% of the 216,926 rentable square feet at 125 Binney Street and 27,197 rentable square feet at 75 Binney Street, with additional potential expansion opportunities through June 30, 2014. See Development and Redevelopment Projects in North America table in Item 2. Properties Value-Added Projects section for additional details on current assumptions included in our guidance for funding the cost to complete the development of 75/125 Binney Street. (2) We have an additional 40% of the 419,806 rentable square feet that are at the letter of intent stage. (3) Dana-Farber Cancer Institute, Inc. also has an option to lease an additional two floors of approximately 99,000 rentable square feet, or an additional 24% of the total rentable square feet of our unconsolidated joint venture development project through June 2014. (4) Represents the total venture cost at completion. As of December 31, 2012, our equity investment was approximately $28.7 million related to our 27.5% ownership interest in the unconsolidated real estate entity. Our expected remaining cash commitment to the venture of approximately $16.9 million is less than the $22.3 million received in March 2012 from an in-substance partial sale of our interest in the underlying real estate. 52 Table of Contents The following table summarizes the delivery of key development and redevelopment projects during the year ended December 31, 2012 (dollars in thousands, except per square foot amounts): Portion Delivered Total Project Occupancy Investment Total Project Initial Completion Rentable as of at Per Stabilized Yield Key Address/Market Date Square Feet 12/31/2012 Completion RSF Cash GAAP Client Tenant(s) Development 259 East Grand Avenue, San Francisco Bay Area November 2012 170,618 100% $ 74,090 $ 434 8.7% (1) 8.6% (1) Onyx Pharmaceuticals, Inc. 400/450 East Jamie Court, San Francisco Bay Area October 2012 163,036 80% $ 112,106 $ 688 4.9% (2) 4.9% (2) Stem CentRx, Inc. 5200 Illumina Way, San Diego October 2012 127,373 100% $ 46,978 $ 369 7.0% 11.2% Illumina, Inc. 4755 Nexus Center Drive, San Diego September 2012 45,255 100% $ 23,084 $ 510 6.8% 7.5% Optimer Pharmaceuticals, Inc.

(2) The Initial Stabilized Yield on a cash and GAAP basis for this project was approximately 4.9% and 4.9%, respectively, or approximately 0.7% and 0.6% higher than our previous Initial Stabilized Yield estimate of 4.2% and 4.3%, on a cash and GAAP basis, respectively. (3) In November and December 2012, we partially completed the redevelopment of 140,532 rentable square feet at 400 Technology Square, a building with 212,124 total rentable square feet. (4) Includes 189,562 rentable square feet delivered in September 2012, and 89,576 rentable square feet delivered in November 2011. Balance sheet Over the past several years, we successfully completed important steps in order to enhance our ability to access the debt capital markets on favorable terms, including (1) receiving our investment-grade ratings, (2) retiring certain debt and deleveraging our balance sheet, (3) generating significant cash flows from the completion and occupancy of key development and redevelopment projects from our non-income-producing assets, and (4) amending our unsecured senior line of credit and unsecured senior bank term loans to increase the amounts available and increase liquidity, extend the maturity dates, and decrease interest rates applicable to outstanding borrowings. We have also strived to maintain and improve the key strengths of our balance sheet and business, which include, among others, balance sheet liquidity, a diverse and creditworthy client tenant base, well-located properties proximate to leading research institutions, favorable lease terms, stable occupancy and cash flows, and demonstrated life science and real estate expertise. We expect to continue the transition of our balance sheet debt from short-term and medium-term bank debt to long-term unsecured fixed rate debt over the next several years. However, some bank debt will remain a component of our long-term capital structure, primarily consisting of an unsecured senior line of credit for liquidity and flexibility, and when appropriate unsecured senior bank term loans. The transition from unhedged variable rate bank debt to longer-term fixed rate unsecured bonds is expected to significantly increase our interest costs. The increase in interest costs in the near to medium term as we transition bank debt to unsecured bonds will be offset by the long-term benefits of longer dated debt maturities, less LIBOR-based variable interest rate risk, and access to more sources of capital. While this transition from unhedged variable rate bank debt is in process, we expect to utilize interest rate swap agreements to reduce our interest rate risk. We expect to keep our unhedged variable rate debt at approximately 30% or less of our total debt over the long term. The transition of unhedged variable rate bank debt to longer-term fixed rate unsecured bonds is not expected to impact the highly effective designation of the existing interest rate swap agreements as of December 31, 2012. Our forecasts assume outstanding unhedged variable rate debt in an amount at least equal to our effective notional amount of interest rate swap agreements in effect at any point in time. Secured mortgage notes payable will remain part of our capital structure; however, we do not anticipate our secured notes payable becoming a significant percentage of total debt outstanding. We believe perpetual preferred stock should remain as a component of our long-term capital structure. 53 Table of Contents As of December 31, 2012, we had four assets held for sale. We may identify additional assets for potential sale in 2013 and thereafter. We expect to invest net proceeds from asset sales into construction projects located in key brain trust cluster markets. As of December 31, 2012, approximately 23% of our gross real estate represented non-income-producing assets (land, preconstruction, development, redevelopment, projects in India and China, and investment in unconsolidated real estate entity). Our active development and redevelopment projects represented 12% of our gross investments in real estate, a significant amount of which is pre-leased and expected to be delivered over the next one to eight quarters. The completion and delivery of these projects will significantly reduce our non-income-producing assets as a percentage of gross investments in real estate. Over the next few years, we may also identify certain land parcels for potential sale. Our goal is to reduce non-income-producing assets as a percentage of our gross investments in real estate to 15% to 17% by December 31, 2013, and 15% or less for the subsequent periods. The chart below shows the historical trend of non-income-producing assets as a percentage of our gross investments in real estate: Balance sheet strategy and significant milestones Execution of capital strategy in 2012 During 2012, we successfully executed our capital strategy and proved that we have access to diverse sources of capital, which we believe is strategically important to our long-term capital structure. These sources of capital included 1) real estate asset dispositions, 2) secured construction project financing, 3) unsecured senior line of credit, 4) unsecured senior note payable, 5) joint venture capital, 6) preferred stock, and 7) common stock sales through our at the market common stock offering program. By accessing all of these capital sources combined with our significant increase in NOI from completion of many development and redevelopment projects, we were able to fund our approximately $577 million in construction activity during the year ended December 31, 2012, on a relatively leverage-neutral basis with minimal issuance of common equity. During the year ended December 31, 2012, net proceeds from issuance of common stock were $97.9 million. Net debt to Adjusted EBITDA as of December 31, 2012 was 7.3x compared to 7.1x as of December 31, 2011. See Non-GAAP measures Net Debt to Adjusted EBITDA for further information. Our various capital market transactions and proceeds from our assets sales for 2012 are more fully described in the Cash Flows Investing Activities and Financing Activities sections. Capital strategy for 2013 O ur balance sheet capital strategy in 2013 will continue to focus on funding our significant development and redevelopment projects in 2013 with leverage-neutral sources of capital and by continuing to execute our asset recycling program while reducing our net debt to adjusted EBITDA to approximately 6.5x by December 31, 2013. We expect to source capital in excess of our projected construction spending for 2013. As more fully described in our Sources and Uses of Capital , we estimate at the mid-point of our disclosed sources of capital that our capital recycling program will generate approximately $377 million as we execute on the sale of operating and non-income producing assets. Our projected cash flows from operating activities after payment of dividends will generate approximately $140 million of capital. Projected common stock offering proceeds under our at the market common stock offering program are projected to be approximately $150 million. These proceeds aggregate approximately $667 million and will fund our projected $570 million in projected construction spending. We project this excess capital, combined with projected growth in NOI from development and redevelopment projects described in our table at Item 2. Properties Development Projects in North America , will improve our net debt to Adjusted EBITDA to approximately 6.5x.

(4) Outstanding balance of secured construction loan as of December 31, 2012, was approximately $16.9 million. (5) Outstanding balance of unsecured senior line of credit as of December 31, 2012, was approximately $566 million. 54 Table of Contents Investment-grade ratings and key credit metrics In July 2011, we received investment-grade ratings from two major rating agencies. Receipt of our investment-grade ratings was a significant milestone that we believe will provide long-term value to our debt and equity stakeholders. Key strengths of our balance sheet and business that highlight our investment-grade credit profile include balance sheet liquidity, a diverse and creditworthy client tenant base, well-located properties proximate to leading research institutions, favorable lease terms, stable occupancy and cash flows, and demonstrated life science and real estate expertise. This significant milestone broadens our access to another key source of debt capital and allows us to continue to pursue our long-term capital, investment, and operating strategies. The issuance of investment-grade unsecured senior notes payable has allowed us to begin the transition from bank debt financing to unsecured senior notes payable, from variable rate debt to fixed rate debt, and from short-term debt to long-term debt. While this transition of bank debt is in process, we will utilize interest rate swap agreements to reduce our interest rate risk. We expect, over the near term while we transition from bank debt to unsecured senior notes payable, to keep our unhedged variable rate debt at less than 30% of our total debt.

(3) At the end of the period. Critical accounting policies Our discussion and analysis of our financial condition and results of operations are based upon our consolidated financial statements, which have been prepared in accordance with GAAP. Our significant accounting policies are described in the notes to our consolidated financial statements appearing elsewhere in this annual report on Form 10-K. The preparation of these financial statements in conformity with GAAP requires us to make estimates, judgments, and assumptions that affect the reported amounts of assets, liabilities, revenues, and expenses. We base these estimates, judgments, and assumptions on historical experience and on various other factors that we believe to be reasonable under the circumstances. Changes in estimates could affect our financial position and specific items in our results of operations that are used by our stockholders, potential investors, industry analysts, and lenders in their evaluation of our performance. Actual results may differ from these estimates under different assumptions or conditions. REIT compliance We have elected to be taxed as a REIT under the Internal Revenue Code. Qualification as a REIT involves the application of highly technical and complex provisions of the Internal Revenue Code to our operations and financial results, and the determination of various factual matters and circumstances not entirely within our control. We believe that our current organization and method of operation comply with the rules and regulations promulgated under the Internal Revenue Code to enable us to qualify, and continue to qualify, as a REIT. However, it is possible that we have been organized or have operated in a manner that would not allow us to qualify as a REIT, or that our future operations could cause us to fail to qualify. If we fail to qualify as a REIT in any taxable year, then we will be required to pay federal income tax (including any applicable alternative minimum tax) on our taxable income at regular corporate rates. If we lose our REIT status, then our net earnings available for investment or distribution to our stockholders will be significantly reduced for each of the years involved and we will no longer be required to make distributions to our stockholders. 55 Table of Contents Investments in real estate, net, and discontinued operations We recognize assets acquired (including the intangible value of above or below market leases, acquired in-place leases, client tenant relationships, and other intangible assets or liabilities), liabilities assumed, and any noncontrolling interest in an acquired entity at their fair value as of the acquisition date. If there is a bargain fixed rate renewal option for the period beyond the non-cancelable lease term, we evaluate factors such as the business conditions in the industry in which the lessee operates, the economic conditions in the area in which the property is located, and the ability of the lessee to sublease the property during the renewal term, in order to determine the likelihood that the lessee will renew. When we determine there is reasonable assurance that such bargain purchase option will be exercised, we consider its impact in determining the intangible value of such lease and its related amortization period. The value of tangible assets acquired is based upon our estimation of value on an as if vacant basis. The value of acquired in-place leases includes the estimated carrying costs during the hypothetical lease-up period and other costs that would have been incurred to execute similar leases, considering market conditions at the acquisition date of the acquired in-place lease. We assess the fair value of tangible and intangible assets based on numerous factors, including estimated cash flow projections that utilize appropriate discount and capitalization rates and available market information. Estimates of future cash flows are based on a number of factors, including the historical operating results, known trends, and market/economic conditions that may affect the property. We also recognize the fair values of assets acquired, the liabilities assumed, and any noncontrolling interest in acquisitions of less than a 100% interest when the acquisition constitutes a change in control of the acquired entity. Acquisition-related costs and restructuring costs are expensed as incurred. The values allocated to buildings, and building improvements, land improvements, tenant improvements, and equipment are depreciated on a straight-line basis using the shorter of the term of the respective ground lease and up to 40 years for buildings and building improvements, an estimated life of 20 years for land improvements, the respective lease term for tenant improvements, and the estimated useful life for equipment. The values of acquired above and below market leases are amortized over the lives of the related leases and recognized as either an increase (for below market leases) or a decrease (for above market leases) to rental income. The values of acquired in-place leases are classified in other assets in the accompanying consolidated balance sheets, and amortized over the remaining terms of the related leases. A property is classified as held for sale when all of the following criteria for a plan of sale have been met: (1) management, having the authority to approve the action, commits to a plan to sell the property; (2) the property is available for immediate sale in its present condition, subject only to terms that are usual and customary; (3) an active program to locate a buyer and other actions required to complete the plan to sell have been initiated; (4) the sale of the property is probable and is expected to be completed within one year; (5) the property is being actively marketed for sale at a price that is reasonable in relation to its current fair value; and (6) actions necessary to complete the plan of sale indicate that it is unlikely that significant changes to the plan will be made or that the plan will be withdrawn. When all of these criteria have been met, the property is classified as held for sale ; and if (1) the operations and cash flows of the property have been or will be eliminated from the ongoing operations, and (2) we will not have any significant continuing involvement in the operations of the property after the sale, then its operations, including any interest expense directly attributable to it, are classified as discontinued operations in our consolidated statements of income; and amounts for all prior periods presented are reclassified from continuing operations to discontinued operations. Depreciation of assets ceases upon designation of a property as held for sale. Impairment of long-lived assets Long-lived assets to be held and used, including our rental properties, land held for future development, construction in progress, and intangibles, are individually evaluated for impairment when conditions exist that indicate that the carrying amount of a long-lived asset may not be recoverable. The carrying amount of a long-lived asset to be held and used is not recoverable if it exceeds the sum of the undiscounted cash flows expected to result from the use and eventual disposition of the asset. Impairment indicators or triggering events for long-lived assets to be held and used, including our rental properties, land held for future development, and construction in progress, are assessed by project and include, but are not limited to, significant fluctuations in estimated net operating income, occupancy changes, significant near-term lease expirations, current and historical operating and/or cash flow losses, construction costs, estimated completion dates, rental rates, and other market factors. We assess the expected undiscounted cash flows based upon numerous factors, including, but not limited to, construction costs, available market information, current and historical operating results, known trends, current market/economic conditions that may affect the property, and our assumptions about the use of the asset, including, if necessary, a probability-weighted approach if multiple outcomes are under consideration. Upon determination that an impairment has occurred, a write-down is recognized to reduce the carrying amount to its estimated fair value. If an impairment loss is not required to be recognized, the recognition of depreciation is adjusted prospectively, as necessary, to reduce the carrying amount of the real estate to its estimated disposition value over the remaining period that the real estate is expected to be held and used. We may adjust depreciation of properties that are expected to be disposed of or redeveloped prior to the end of their useful lives. 56 Table of Contents We use a held for sale impairment model for our properties classified as held for sale. The held for sale impairment model is different from the held and used impairment model. Under the held for sale impairment model, an impairment loss is recognized if the carrying amount of the long-lived asset classified as held for sale exceeds its fair value less cost to sell. Because of these two different models, it is possible for a long-lived asset previously classified as held and used to require the recognition of an impairment charge upon classification as held for sale. Capitalization of costs We are required to capitalize project costs, including predevelopment costs, interest, property taxes, insurance, and other costs directly related and essential to the acquisition, development, redevelopment, or construction of a project. Capitalization of construction, development, and redevelopment costs is required while activities are ongoing to prepare an asset for its intended use. Fluctuations in our development, redevelopment, and construction activities could result in significant changes to total expenses and net income. For example, had we experienced a 10% reduction in construction, development, and redevelopment activities without a corresponding decrease in indirect project costs, including interest and payroll, total expenses would have increased by approximately $7.5 million for the year ended December 31, 2012. Costs incurred after a project is substantially complete and ready for its intended use are expensed as incurred. Should development, redevelopment, or construction activity cease, interest, property taxes, insurance, and certain other costs would no longer be eligible for capitalization and would be expensed as incurred. Expenditures for repairs and maintenance and demolition are expensed as incurred. We also capitalize costs directly related and essential to our leasing activities. These costs are amortized on a straight-line basis over the terms of the related leases. Costs related to unsuccessful leasing opportunities are expensed as incurred. Predevelopment and acquisition costs related to abandoned projects are expensed as incurred. These costs are classified as general and administrative expense in the accompanying consolidated statements of income. These amounts aggregated approximately $1.1 million, $1.0 million, and $0.1 million for the years ended December 31, 2012, 2011, and 2010, respectively. Investments We hold equity investments in certain publicly traded companies and privately held entities primarily involved in the life science industry. All of our investments in actively traded public companies are considered available for sale and are reflected in the accompanying consolidated balance sheets at fair value. Fair value has been determined based upon the closing price as of each balance sheet date, with unrealized gains and losses shown as a separate component of comprehensive income. The classification of each investment is determined at the time each investment is made, and such determination is reevaluated at each balance sheet date. The cost of each investment sold is determined by the specific identification method, with net realized gains or losses classified in other income in the accompanying consolidated balance sheets. Investments in privately held entities are generally accounted for under the cost method when our interest in the entity is so minor that we have virtually no influence over the entity operating and financial policies. Certain investments in privately held entities are accounted for under the equity method when our interest in the entity is not deemed so minor that we have virtually no influence over the entities operating and financial policies. Under the equity method of accounting, we recognize our investment initially at cost and adjust the carrying amount of the investment to recognize our share of the earnings or losses of the investee subsequent to the date of our investment. Additionally, we limit our ownership percentage in the voting stock of each individual entity to less than 10%. As of December 31, 2012 and 2011, our ownership percentage in the voting stock of each individual entity was less than 10%. Individual investments are evaluated for impairment when changes in conditions may indicate an impairment exists. The factors that we consider in making these assessments include, but are not limited to, market prices, market conditions, available financing, prospects for favorable or unfavorable clinical trial results, new product initiatives, and new collaborative agreements. If there are no identified events or changes in circumstances that would have an adverse effect on our cost method investments, we do not estimate their fair value. For all of our investments, if a decline in the fair value of an investment below the carrying value is determined to be other than temporary, such investment is written down to its estimated fair value with a non-cash charge to current earnings. For a description of the methodology we use to determine the fair value of privately held entities, refer to Note 9, Fair Value of Financial Instruments. 57 Table of Contents Interest rate swap agreements We are exposed to certain risks arising from both our business operations and economic conditions. We principally manage our exposures to a wide variety of business and operational risks through management of our core business activities. We manage economic risks, including interest rate, liquidity, and credit risk, primarily by managing the amount, sources, and duration of our debt funding and the use of interest rate swap agreements. Specifically, we enter into interest rate swap agreements to manage exposures that arise from business activities that result in the payment of future known and uncertain cash amounts, the value of which are determined by interest rates. Our interest rate swap agreements are used to manage differences in the amount, timing, and duration of our known or expected cash payments principally related to our borrowings based on LIBOR. We do not use derivatives for trading or speculative purposes and currently all of our derivatives are designated as hedges. Our objectives in using interest rate swap agreements are to add stability to interest expense and to manage our exposure to interest rate movements in accordance with our interest rate risk management strategy. Interest rate swap agreements designated as cash flow hedges involve the receipt of variable rate amounts from a counterparty in exchange for the Company making fixed rate payments over the life of the interest rate swap agreements without exchange of the underlying notional amount of interest rate swap agreements. We utilize interest rate swap agreements, including interest rate swap agreements, to hedge a portion of our exposure to variable interest rates primarily associated with our unsecured senior line of credit and unsecured senior bank term loans. We recognize our interest rate swap agreements as either assets or liabilities on the balance sheet at fair value. The accounting for changes in fair value (i.e., gains or losses) of a derivative instrument depends on whether it has been designated and qualifies as part of a hedging relationship and, further, on the type of hedging relationship. For those derivative instruments that are designated and qualify as hedging instruments, a company must designate the hedging instrument, based on the hedged exposure, as a fair value hedge, a cash flow hedge, or a hedge of a net investment in a foreign operation. We do not use derivatives for trading or speculative purposes, and currently all of our derivatives are designated as hedges. Our interest rate swap agreements are considered cash flow hedges as they are designated and qualify as hedges of the exposure to variability in expected future cash flows. Hedge accounting generally provides for the matching of the timing of gain or loss recognition on the hedging instrument with the recognition of the changes in the earnings effect of the hedged transactions in a cash flow hedge. All of our interest rate swap agreements meet the criteria to be deemed highly effective in reducing our exposure to variable interest rates. We formally document all relationships between interest rate swap agreements and hedged items, including the method for evaluating effectiveness and the risk strategy. We make an assessment at the inception of each interest rate swap agreement and on an ongoing basis to determine whether these instruments are highly effective in offsetting changes in cash flows associated with the hedged items. The ineffective portion of each interest rate swap agreement is immediately recognized in earnings. While we intend to continue to meet the conditions for such hedge accounting, if swaps did not qualify as highly effective, the changes in the fair values of the derivatives used as hedges would be reflected in earnings. Interest rate swap agreements designated as cash flow hedges involve the receipt of variable rate amounts from a counterparty in exchange for the Company making fixed rate payments over the life of the interest rate swap agreements without exchange of the underlying notional amount of interest rate swap agreements. The effective portion of changes in the fair value of our interest rate swap agreements that are designated and that qualify as cash flow hedges is recognized in accumulated other comprehensive income. Amounts classified in accumulated other comprehensive income will be reclassified into earnings in the period during which the hedged transactions affect earnings. The fair value of each interest rate swap agreement is determined using widely accepted valuation techniques including discounted cash flow analyses on the expected cash flows of each derivative. These analyses reflect the contractual terms of the derivatives, including the period to maturity, and use observable market-based inputs, including interest rate curves and implied volatilities (also referred to as significant other observable inputs ). The fair values of our interest rate swap agreements are determined using the market standard methodology of netting the discounted future fixed cash payments and the discounted expected variable cash receipts. The variable cash receipts are based on an expectation of future interest rates (forward curves) derived from observable market interest rate curves. The fair value calculation also includes an amount for risk of non-performance using significant unobservable inputs such as estimates of current credit spreads to evaluate the likelihood of default, which we have determined to be insignificant to the overall fair value of our interest rate swap agreements. 58 Table of Contents Recognition of rental income and tenant recoveries Rental income from leases with scheduled rent increases, free rent, incentives, and other rent adjustments is recognized on a straight-line basis over the respective lease terms. We classify amounts currently recognized as income, and expected to be received in later years, as an asset in deferred rent in the accompanying consolidated balance sheets. Amounts received currently, but recognized as income in future years, are classified in accounts payable, accrued expenses, and tenant security deposits in the accompanying consolidated balance sheets. We commence recognition of rental income at the date the property is ready for its intended use and the client tenant takes possession of or controls the physical use of the property. Tenant recoveries related to reimbursement of real estate taxes, insurance, utilities, repairs and maintenance, and other operating expenses are recognized as revenue in the period during which the applicable expenses are incurred. Tenant receivables consist primarily of amounts due for contractual lease payments, reimbursements of common area maintenance expenses, property taxes, and other expenses recoverable from client tenants. Tenant receivables are expected to be collected within one year. We maintain an allowance for estimated losses that may result from the inability of our client tenants to make payments required under the terms of the lease and for tenant recoveries due. If a client tenant fails to make contractual payments beyond any allowance, we may recognize additional bad debt expense in future periods equal to the amount of uncollectible rent and deferred rent receivables arising from the straight-lining of rent. As of December 31, 2012 and 2011, we had no allowance for estimated losses. As of December 31, 2012, approximately 94% of our leases (on a rentable square footage basis) were triple net leases, requiring client tenants to pay substantially all real estate taxes, insurance, utilities, common area expenses, and other operating expenses (including increases thereto) in addition to base rent. Approximately 96% of our leases (on a rentable square footage basis) contained effective annual rent escalations that were either fixed or based on a consumer price index or another index. Additionally, approximately 92% of our leases (on a rentable square footage basis) provided for the recapture of certain capital expenditures. Impact of recently issued accounting standards In May 2011, the FASB issued an Accounting Standards Update ( ASU ) to substantially converge the guidance in GAAP and International Financial Reporting Standards ( IFRS ) on fair value measurements and disclosures. The ASU changed several aspects of the fair value measurement guidance in FASB Accounting Standards Codification 820, Fair Value Measurement, including (1) the application of the concepts of highest and best use and valuation premise; (2) the introduction of an option to measure groups of offsetting assets and liabilities on a net basis; (3) the incorporation of certain premiums and discounts in fair value measurements; and (4) the measurement of the fair value of certain instruments classified in stockholders equity. In addition, the ASU included several new fair value disclosure requirements, such as information about valuation techniques and significant unobservable inputs used in fair value measurements and a narrative description of the fair value measurements sensitivity to changes in significant unobservable inputs. The ASU is effective for public companies during the interim and annual periods, beginning after December 15, 2011. We adopted this ASU as of January 1, 2012. The adoption of the ASU did not impact our consolidated financial statements. In June 2011, the FASB issued an ASU to make presentation of items within other comprehensive income ( OCI ) more prominent. Entities are required to present items of net income, items of OCI, and total comprehensive income either in a single continuous statement or in two separate but consecutive statements. There no longer exists the option to present OCI in the statement of changes in stockholders equity. In December 2011, the FASB decided to defer the requirement that companies present reclassification adjustments for each component of accumulated other comprehensive income ( AOCI ) in both net income and OCI on the face of the financial statements. Reclassifications out of AOCI will be either presented on the face of the financial statement in which OCI is presented or disclosed in the notes to the financial statements. This deferral does not change the requirement to present items of net income, items of OCI, and total comprehensive income in either one continuous statement or two separate consecutive statements. The ASU is effective for public companies during the interim and annual periods, beginning after December 15, 2011. We adopted this ASU as of January 1, 2012, and have presented the consolidated statements of comprehensive income separately from the consolidated statements of income. 59 Table of Contents Results of operations As a result of changes within our total property portfolio, the financial data presented in the table in Comparison of the Year Ended December 31, 2012, to the Year Ended December 31, 2011 shows significant changes in revenue and expenses from period to period. In order to supplement an evaluation of our results of operations over a given period, we analyze the operating performance for all properties that were fully operating for the entire periods presented (herein referred to as Same Properties ) separate from properties acquired subsequent to the first period presented, properties undergoing active development and active redevelopment, and corporate entities (legal entities performing general and administrative functions), which are excluded from same property results (herein referred to as Non-Same Properties ). Additionally, rental revenues from lease termination fees, if any, are excluded from the results of the Same Properties. The following table presents information regarding our Same Properties as of December 31, 2012, 2011, and 2010: December 31, 2012 2011 2010 Number of properties 131 127 129 Rentable square feet 9,581,079 9,489,070 9,426,729 Occupancy - current period 93.9% 93.7% 94.6% Occupancy - same period prior year 93.7% 94.5% 95.1% The following table reconciles Same Properties to total properties for the year ended December 31, 2012: Number of Properties Number of Properties Number of Properties Development active Development deliveries since January 1, 2011 Development/Redevelopment Asia 9 (1) 225 Binney Street 1 259 East Grand Avenue 1 409/499 Illinois Street 2 400/450 East Jamie Court 2 Properties acquired since January 1, 2011 430 East 29th Street 1 455 Mission Bay Boulevard South 1 3013/3033 Science Park Road 1 4 4755 Nexus Center Drive 1 6 Davis Drive 1 5200 Illumina Way 1 2 7 Triangle Drive 1 Canada (2) 7 Redevelopment active Redevelopment deliveries since January 1, 2011 Properties held for sale 4 11119 North Torrey Pines Road 1 10300 Campus Point Drive 1 Total properties excluded from same properties 47 1551 Eastlake Avenue 1 15010 Broschart Road 1 Same properties 131 1616 Eastlake Avenue 1 20 Walkup Drive 1 Total properties as of December 31, 2012 178 285 Bear Hill Road 1 215 First Street 1 343 Oyster Point Boulevard 1 3530/3550 John Hopkins Court 2 400 Technology Square 1 3565 General Atomics Court 1 4757 Nexus Center Drive 1 500 Arsenal Street 1 9800 Medical Center Drive 3 6101 Quadrangle Drive 1 10 620 Professional Drive 1 6275 Nancy Ridge Drive 1 11 (1) Property count includes two development deliveries, one redevelopment delivery, one property acquired since January 1, 2011, and five active development and redevelopment properties.

One of the two buildings represents the ground-up development completed in the year ended December 31, 2012. 60 Table of Contents Net operating income is a non-GAAP financial measure equal to income from continuing operations, the most directly comparable GAAP financial measure, plus loss on early extinguishment of debt, impairment of land parcel, depreciation and amortization, interest expense, and general and administrative expense. We believe net operating income provides useful information to investors regarding our financial condition and results of operations because it reflects primarily those income and expense items that are incurred at the property level. Therefore, we believe net operating income is a useful measure for evaluating the operating performance of our real estate assets. Net operating income on a cash basis is net operating income on a GAAP basis, adjusted to exclude the effect of straight-line rent adjustments required by GAAP. We believe that net operating income on a cash basis is helpful to investors as an additional measure of operating performance because it eliminates straight-line rent adjustments to rental revenue. Further, we believe net operating income is useful to investors as a performance measure, because when compared across periods, net operating income reflects the impact on operations from trends in occupancy rates, rental rates, and operating costs, providing perspective not immediately apparent from income from continuing operations. Net operating income excludes certain components from income from continuing operations in order to provide results that are more closely related to the results of operations of our properties. For example, interest expense is not necessarily linked to the operating performance of a real estate asset and is often incurred at the corporate level rather than at the property level. In addition, depreciation and amortization, because of historical cost accounting and useful life estimates, may distort operating performance at the property level. Real estate impairments have been excluded in deriving net operating income because we do not consider impairment losses to be property-level operating expenses. Real estate impairment losses relate to changes in the values of our assets and do not reflect the current operating performance with respect to related revenues or expenses. Our real estate impairments represent the write-down in the value of the assets to the estimated fair value less cost to sell. These impairments result from investing decisions and the deterioration in market conditions that adversely impact underlying real estate values. Our calculation of net operating income also excludes charges incurred from changes in certain financing decisions, such as losses on early extinguishment of debt, as these charges often relate to the timing of corporate strategy. Property operating expenses that are included in determining net operating income consist of costs that are related to our operating properties, such as utilities, repairs and maintenance, rental expense related to ground leases, contracted services, such as janitorial, engineering, and landscaping, property taxes and insurance, and property-level salaries. General and administrative expenses consist primarily of accounting and corporate compensation, corporate insurance, professional fees, office rent, and office supplies that are incurred as part of corporate office management. Net operating income presented by us may not be comparable to net operating income reported by other equity REITs that define net operating income differently. We believe that in order to facilitate a clear understanding of our operating results, net operating income should be examined in conjunction with income from continuing operations as presented in our consolidated statements of income. Net operating income should not be considered as an alternative to income from continuing operations as an indication of our performance, or as an alternative to cash flows as a measure of liquidity or a measure of our ability to make distributions. The chart below shows our net operating income for the years ended December 31, 2008, through December 31, 2012 (in millions): 61 Table of Contents Comparison of the year ended December 31, 2012, to the year ended December 31, 2011 The following table presents a comparison of the components of net operating income for our Same Properties and Non-Same Properties for the year ended December 31, 2012, compared to the year ended December 31, 2011, and a reconciliation of net operating income to income from continuing operations, the most directly comparable financial measure (in thousands): Year Ended December 31, 2012 2011 $ Change % Change Revenues: Rental Same Properties $ 317,839 $ 316,041 $ 1,798 1 % Rental Non-Same Properties 114,613 98,123 16,490 17 Total rental 432,452 414,164 18,288 4 Tenant recoveries Same Properties 105,628 104,616 1,012 1 Tenant recoveries Non-Same Properties 29,558 23,683 5,875 25 Total tenant recoveries 135,186 128,299 6,887 5 Other income Same Properties 349 32 317 991 Other income Non-Same Properties 18,086 5,730 12,356 216 Total other income 18,435 5,762 12,673 220 Total revenues Same Properties 423,816 420,689 3,127 1 Total revenues Non-Same Properties 162,257 127,536 34,721 27 Total revenues 586,073 548,225 37,848 7 Expenses: Rental operations Same Properties 126,283 121,599 4,684 4 Rental operations Non-Same Properties 48,240 37,968 10,272 27 Total rental operations 174,523 159,567 14,956 9 Net operating income: Net operating income Same Properties 297,533 299,090 (1,557 ) (1 ) Net operating income Non-Same Properties 114,017 89,568 24,449 27 Total net operating income 411,550 388,658 22,892 6 Other expenses: General and administrative 47,795 41,127 6,668 16 Interest 69,184 63,378 5,806 9 Depreciation and amortization 188,850 153,087 35,763 23 Impairment of land parcel 2,050 2,050 100 Loss on early extinguishment of debt 2,225 6,485 (4,260 ) (66 ) 310,104 264,077 46,027 17 Income from continuing operations $ 101,446 $ 124,581 $ (23,135 ) (19 %) Rental revenues Total rental revenues for the year ended December 31, 2012, increased by $18.3 million, or 4%, to $432.5 million, compared to $414.2 million for the year ended December 31, 2011. The increase was primarily due to rental revenues from our Non-Same Properties, including 21 development and redevelopment projects that were completed and delivered after January 1, 2011, and six operating properties that were acquired after January 1, 2011. 62 Table of Contents Tenant recoveries Tenant recoveries for the year ended December 31, 2012, compared to the year ended December 31, 2011, increased by $6.9 million, or 5%, to $135.2 million, compared to an increase of $14.9 million, or 9%, of rental operating expenses. Same Properties tenant recoveries increased by $1.0 million, while Same Properties rental operating expenses increased by $4.6 million, primarily due to normal temporary vacancies throughout our Same Properties portfolio. Occupancy of Same Properties was 93.9% and 93.7% as of December 31, 2012 and 2011, respectively. Non-Same Properties tenant recoveries increased by $5.9 million, while Non-Same Properties rental operating expenses increased by $10.3 million, primarily due to some vacancies related to development and redevelopment properties delivered into operating properties since January 1, 2011, and an increase in certain non-recoverable expenses. As of December 31, 2012, approximately 94% of our leases (on a rentable square footage basis) were triple net leases, requiring client tenants to pay substantially all real estate taxes, insurance, utilities, common area expenses, and other operating expenses (including increases thereto) in addition to base rent. Other income Other income for the year ended December 31, 2012 and 2011, of $18.4 million and $5.8 million, respectively, was as follows (in thousands): Year Ended December 31, Component 2012 2011 Change Construction management fee income $ 2,679 $ 1,859 $ 820 Interest income 3,375 852 2,523 Investment income 12,381 3,051 9,330 Total other income $ 18,435 $ 5,762 $ 12,673 Total other income for the year ended December 31, 2012, increased by $12.6 million, or 220%, to $18.4 million, compared to $5.8 million for the year ended December 31, 2011. Investment income increased primarily due to the realization of a $5.8 million gain from an equity investment primarily related to one non-tenant life science entity and an overall increase in the investment income earned. Interest income also increased primarily as a result of the increase in interest earned from higher bank account balances. Rental operating expenses Total rental operating expenses for the year ended December 31, 2012, increased by $14.9 million, or 9%, to $174.5 million, compared to $159.6 million for the year ended December 31, 2011. Approximately $10.3 million of the increase was due to an increase in rental operating expenses from our Non-Same Properties, primarily related to 21 development and redevelopment projects that were completed and delivered after January 1, 2011, and six operating properties that were acquired after January 1, 2011. The remaining $4.6 million increase was due to increases in rental operating expenses from our Same Properties. The increase in rental operating expenses at our Same Properties was primarily due to increases in property taxes, property insurance, and repairs and maintenance expenses. In October 2012, our property at 450 East 29 th Street, the East Tower of the Alexandria Center for Life Science New York City, a multi-tenant building with 309,141 rentable square feet, experienced water damage, along with many other properties owned by other landlords in New York City. Our assessment identified water damage in the underground parking area at our property, with no structural damage. The total estimated water damage and cleanup costs were approximately $0.8 million, and we expect to recover a majority of these costs. General and administrative expenses General and administrative expenses for the year ended December 31, 2012, increased by $6.7 million, or 16%, to $47.8 million, compared to $41.1 million for the year ended December 31, 2011. The increase was primarily due to costs associated with the Amended and Restated Employment Agreement with our Chief Executive Officer to provide a performance-based compensation program. Additionally, the increase in general and administrative expenses was related to an increase in the number of employees related to the growth in both the depth and breadth of our operations in multiple markets. During the year ended December 31, 2012, our average number of employees increased by 25 employees, or 13%, to 221, compared to an average of 196 for the year ended December 31, 2011. As a percentage of total revenues, general and administrative expenses were 8.2% and 7.5%, respectively, for the year ended December 31, 2012 and 2011. 63 Table of Contents Interest expense Interest expense for the year ended December 31, 2012, increased by $5.8 million, or 9%, to $69.2 million, compared to $63.4 million for the year ended December 31, 2011, detailed as follows (in thousands): Year Ended December 31, Component 2012 2011 Change Secured notes payable $ 40,439 $ 46,231 $ (5,792 ) Unsecured senior convertible notes 246 9,567 (9,321 ) Unsecured senior notes payable 21,255 21,255 Unsecured senior line of credit 12,035 21,583 (9,548 ) Unsecured senior bank term loan 25,567 16,085 9,482 Interest rate swaps 22,309 21,457 852 Amortization of loan fees and other interest 10,084 9,511 573 Capitalized interest (62,751 ) (61,056 ) (1,695 ) Total interest expense $ 69,184 $ 63,378 $ 5,806 Interest expense increased primarily due to the issuance of our unsecured senior notes payable and an increase in the balance outstanding on our unsecured senior bank term loans since January 1, 2011. This increase was partially offset by repayments of nine secured notes payable approximating $71.2 million and repurchases of our 3.70% unsecured senior convertible notes ( 3.70% Unsecured Senior Convertible Notes ) aggregating $84.7 million since January 1, 2011. Interest expense related to our unsecured senior line of credit also decreased, primarily due to a lower average balance outstanding during the year ended December 31, 2012, compared to the year ended December 31, 2011, and a decrease in the effective interest rate of our unsecured senior line of credit from 2.6% as of December 31, 2011, to 1.4% as of December 31, 2012. We have entered into certain interest rate swap agreements to hedge a portion of our exposure primarily related to variable interest rates associated with our unsecured senior line of credit and unsecured senior bank term loans (see Liquidity and Capital Resources Contractual Obligations Interest Rate Swap Agreements ). Depreciation and amortization Depreciation and amortization for the year ended December 31, 2012, increased by $35.8 million, or 23%, to $188.9 million, compared to $153.1 million for the year ended December 31, 2011. The increase resulted primarily from increased depreciation related to building improvements, including 21 development and redevelopment projects that were completed and delivered after January 1, 2011, and six operating properties that were acquired after January 1, 2011. Depreciation also increased as a result of depreciation adjustments necessary to reduce the carrying amount of buildings and improvements to zero in connection with planned redevelopments. Impairment of land parcel During the three months ended December 31, 2012, we committed to sell a land parcel with 50,000 developable square feet rather than hold it on a long-term basis for future development. Upon our decision to sell, we wrote down the value of the land parcel to our estimate of fair value, based on the anticipated sales price, less cost to sell. As a result, we recognized an impairment charge of approximately $2.1 million. Loss on early extinguishment of debt During the year ended December 31, 2012, we recognized a loss on early extinguishment of debt of approximately $2.2 million, including $1.6 million related to the write-off of unamortized loan fees upon modification of our unsecured senior line of credit and $0.6 million related to the write-off of unamortized loan fees resulting from the early repayment of $250.0 million of our 2012 Unsecured Senior Bank Term Loan. During the year ended December 31, 2011, we recognized a loss on early extinguishment of debt of approximately $6.5 million related to the repurchase, in privately negotiated transactions, of approximately $217.1 million principal amount of our 3.70% Unsecured Senior Convertible Notes and the partial and early repayment of our 2012 Unsecured Senior Bank Term Loan. 64 Table of Contents Income from discontinued operations, net Income from discontinued operations, net, of $2.2 million for the year ended December 31, 2012, includes the results of operations of four operating properties that were classified as held for sale and the results of operations of six properties sold during the year ended December 31, 2012. Income from discontinued operations, net, for the year ended December 31, 2011, includes the results of operations of four operating properties that were classified as held for sale as of December 31, 2012, the results of six properties sold during the year ended December 31, 2012, and the results of operations of one property sold during the year ended December 31, 2011. Impairment of real estate assets During the three months ended September 30, 2012, we committed to sell four operating properties comprised of 1124 Columbia Street in the Seattle market and One Innovation Drive, 377 Plantation Street, and 381 Plantation Street in the suburban Greater Boston market, aggregating 504,130 rentable square feet, rather than to hold them on a long-term basis. At the time of our commitment to dispose of these assets, these four properties were on average 94% occupied and generated approximately $12.8 million in annual operating income. Upon our commitment to sell, we wrote down the net book value of these assets to our estimate of fair value, based on the anticipated sales price, less cost to sell. As a result, we recognized an impairment charge of approximately $9.8 million. In December 2012, we entered into an agreement with a third party to sell 1124 Columbia Street at a price of $42.6 million, which was below our reduced net book value as of September 30, 2012. As a result, we recognized an additional impairment charge of $1.6 million in order to write down the net book value to our revised estimated fair value less cost to sell. In January 2013, we completed the sale of this property and no gain or loss was recognized. 65 Table of Contents Comparison of the year ended December 31, 2011, to the year ended December 31, 2010 The following table presents a comparison of the components of net operating income for our Same Properties and Non-Same Properties for the year ended December 31, 2011, compared to the year ended December 31, 2010, and a reconciliation of net operating income to income from continuing operations, the most directly comparable financial measure (in thousands): Year Ended December 31, 2011 2010 $ Change % Change Revenues: Rental Same Properties $ 276,871 $ 278,248 $ (1,377 ) % Rental Non-Same Properties 137,293 71,831 65,462 91 Total rental 414,164 350,079 64,085 18 Tenant recoveries Same Properties 93,696 87,459 6,237 7 Tenant recoveries Non-Same Properties 34,603 17,964 16,639 93 Total tenant recoveries 128,299 105,423 22,876 22 Other income Same Properties 44 262 (218 ) (83 ) Other income Non-Same Properties 5,718 4,857 861 18 Total other income 5,762 5,119 643 13 Total revenues Same Properties 370,611 365,969 4,642 1 Total revenues Non-Same Properties 177,614 94,652 82,962 88 Total revenues 548,225 460,621 87,604 19 Expenses: Rental operations Same Properties 105,115 98,786 6,329 6 Rental operations Non-Same Properties 54,452 24,523 29,929 122 Total rental operations 159,567 123,309 36,258 29 Net operating income: Net operating income Same Properties 265,496 267,183 (1,687 ) (1 ) Net operating income Non-Same Properties 123,162 70,129 53,033 76 Total net operating income 388,658 337,312 51,346 15 Other expenses: General and administrative 41,127 34,345 6,782 20 Interest 63,378 69,509 (6,131 ) (9 ) Depreciation and amortization 153,087 121,207 31,880 26 Loss on early extinguishment of debt 6,485 45,168 (38,683 ) (86 ) 264,077 270,229 (6,152 ) (2 ) Income from continuing operations $ 124,581 $ 67,083 $ 57,498 86 % Rental revenues Total rental revenues for the year ended December 31, 2011, increased by $64.1 million, or 18%, to $414.2 million, compared to $350.1 million for the year ended December 31, 2010. The increase was primarily due to rental revenues from our Non-Same Properties, including six development and redevelopment projects that were completed and delivered after January 1, 2010, and nine operating properties that were acquired after January 1, 2010. Tenant recoveries Tenant recoveries for the year ended December 31, 2011, compared to the year ended December 31, 2010, increased by $22.9 million, or 22%, to $128.3 million, compared to an increase of $36.3 million, or 29%, of rental operating expenses. Non-Same Properties tenant recoveries increased by $16.7 million, while Non-Same Properties rental operating expenses increased by $30.0 million, primarily due to a temporary vacancy in one development property delivered into operating properties since January 1, 2010, and an increase in certain non-recoverable expenses. As of December 31, 2011, approximately 95% of our leases (on a rentable square footage basis) were triple net leases, requiring client tenants to pay substantially all real estate taxes, insurance, utilities, common area expenses, and other operating expenses (including increases thereto) in addition to base rent. 66 Table of Contents Other income Other income for the year ended December 31, 2011 and 2010, of $5.8 million and $5.1 million, respectively, was as follows (in thousands): Year Ended December 31, Component 2011 2010 Change Construction management fee income $ 1,859 $ 2,322 $ (463 ) Interest income 852 750 102 Investment income 3,051 2,047 1,004 Total other income $ 5,762 $ 5,119 $ 643 The increase of approximately $0.6 million is primarily due to an increase in investment income, offset by a decrease in construction management fees, for the year ended December 31, 2011, compared to the year ended December 31, 2010. Rental operating expenses Total rental operating expenses for the year ended December 31, 2011, increased by $36.3 million, or 29%, to $159.6 million, compared to $123.3 million for the year ended December 31, 2010. Approximately $30.0 million of the increase was due to an increase in rental operating expenses from our Non-Same Properties, primarily related to six development and redevelopment projects that were completed and delivered after January 1, 2010, and nine operating properties that were acquired after January 1, 2010. The remaining $6.3 million increase was due to increases in rental operating expenses from our Same Properties. The increase in rental operating expenses at our Same Properties was primarily attributable to an increase in property taxes, utilities, and common area repairs and maintenance expenses. General and administrative expenses General and administrative expenses for the year ended December 31, 2011, increased by $6.8 million, or 20%, to $41.1 million, compared to $34.3 million for the year ended December 31, 2010. The increase was primarily due to an increase in payroll expenses related to an increase in the number of employees related to the growth in both the depth and breadth of our operations in multiple markets. During the year ended December 31, 2011, our average number of employees increased by 29 employees, or 17%, to 196, compared to an average of 167 for the year ended December 31, 2010. As a percentage of total revenues, general and administrative expenses were 7.5% for the years ended December 31, 2011 and 2010. Interest expense Interest expense for the year ended December 31, 2011, decreased by $6.1 million, or 9%, to $63.4 million, compared to $69.5 million for the year ended December 31, 2010, detailed as follows (in thousands): Year Ended December 31, Component 2011 2010 Change Secured notes payable $ 46,231 $ 50,600 $ (4,369 ) Unsecured senior convertible notes 9,567 32,894 (23,327 ) Unsecured senior line of credit 21,583 9,928 11,655 Unsecured senior bank term loan 16,085 10,370 5,715 Interest rate swaps 21,457 30,505 (9,048 ) Amortization of loan fees and other interest 9,511 8,047 1,464 Capitalized interest (61,056 ) (72,835 ) 11,779 Total interest expense $ 63,378 $ 69,509 $ (6,131 ) 67 Table of Contents Interest expense decreased primarily due to the retirement of substantially all $240.0 million of our 8.00% unsecured senior convertible notes ( 8.00% Unsecured Senior Convertible Notes ) during the year ended December 31, 2010, and repurchases of our 3.70% Unsecured Senior Convertible Notes aggregating $217.1 million since January 1, 2010. The decrease in interest on our interest rate swap agreements was primarily due to the net reduction of interest rate swap agreements with notional amounts of interest rate swap agreements in effect during the year ended December 31, 2011, of $250.0 million as compared to the year ended December 31, 2010. Interest expense related to our secured notes payable decreased due to the repayments of seven secured notes payable approximating $55.7 million. The increase in interest on our unsecured senior line of credit and unsecured senior bank term loans was primarily attributable to an increase in the applicable margin from 1.0% as of December 31, 2010, to 2.3% as of December 31, 2011, on our unsecured senior line of credit, coupled with an increase in outstanding unsecured senior bank loans from $1.5 billion as of December 31, 2010, to $2.0 billion as of December 31, 2011. We have entered into certain interest rate swap agreements to hedge a portion of our exposure primarily related to variable interest rates associated with our unsecured senior line of credit and unsecured senior bank term loans (see Liquidity and Capital Resources Contractual Obligations Interest Rate Swap Agreements ). Depreciation and amortization Depreciation and amortization for the year ended December 31, 2011, increased by $31.9 million, or 26%, to $153.1 million, compared to $121.2 million for the year ended December 31, 2010. The increase resulted primarily from increased depreciation related to building improvements, including six development and redevelopment projects that were completed and delivered after January 1, 2010, and nine operating properties that were acquired after January 1, 2010. Loss on early extinguishment of debt During the year ended December 31, 2011, we recognized a loss on early extinguishment of debt of approximately $6.5 million related to the repurchase, in privately negotiated transactions, of approximately $217.1 million principal amount of our 3.70% Unsecured Senior Convertible Notes and the partial and early repayment of our 2012 Unsecured Senior Bank Term Loan. During the year ended December 31, 2010,we recognized a loss on early extinguishment of debt of approximately $45.2 million, composed of a loss of approximately $2.4 million recognized in December 2010 related to the repurchase, in privately negotiated transactions, of approximately $82.8 million of our 3.70% Unsecured Senior Convertible Notes, and losses of approximately $41.5 million and $1.3 million recognized in June 2010 and July 2010, respectively, related to the retirement of substantially all $240 million aggregate principal amount of our 8.00% Unsecured Senior Convertible Notes. Income from discontinued operations, net Income from discontinued operations, net, for the year ended December 31, 2011, includes the results of operations of four operating properties that were classified as held for sale as of December 31, 2012, the results of six properties sold during the year ended December 31, 2012, and the results of operations of one property sold during the year ended December 31, 2011. Income from discontinued operations, net, of $12.5 million for the year ended December 31, 2010, includes the results of operations of four properties that were classified as held for sale, one property sold during the year ended December 31, 2011, and the results of operations and gain related to the sale of one property sold during the year ended December 31, 2010. 68 Table of Contents Projected results Based on our current view of existing market conditions and certain current assumptions, we expect that our earnings per share attributable to Alexandria Real Estate Equities, Inc. common stockholders diluted and FFO per share attributable to Alexandria Real Estate Equities, Inc. common stockholders diluted for the year ended December 31, 2013, will be as set forth in the table below. The table below provides a reconciliation of FFO per share attributable to Alexandria Real Estate Equities, Inc. common stockholders diluted, a non-GAAP measure, to earnings per share attributable to Alexandria Real Estate Equities, Inc. common stockholders diluted, the most directly comparable GAAP measure and other key assumptions included in our guidance for the year ended December 31, 2013. See Non-GAAP Measures FFO and FFO, as Adjusted for further information regarding FFO. Guidance for the Year Ended December 31, 2013 Earnings per share attributable to Alexandria Real Estate Equities, Inc. common stockholders diluted $1.41 to $1.61 Depreciation and amortization $2.93 to $3.13 FFO per share attributable to Alexandria Real Estate Equities, Inc. common stockholders diluted $4.44 to $4.64 Key projection assumptions: Same property net operating income growth cash basis 4% to 7% Same property net operating income growth GAAP basis 0% to 3% Rental rate steps on lease renewals and re-leasing of space cash basis Flat to slightly positive Rental rate steps on lease renewals and re-leasing of space GAAP basis Up 5% to 10% Occupancy percentage for all operating properties at December 31, 2013 93.9% to 94.3% Straight-line rents $24 to $26 million Amortization of above and below market leases $3 to $4 million General and administrative expenses $48 to $51 million Capitalization of interest $47 to $53 million Interest expense, net $74 to $84 million Net debt to adjusted EBITDA for the annualized three months ended December 31, 2013 6.5x Fixed charge coverage ratio for the annualized three months ended December 31, 2013 2.9x to 3.0x As of December 31, 2012, we had approximately $431.6 million and $199.7 million of construction in progress related to our three North American development and eight North American redevelopment projects, respectively. The completion of these projects, along with recently delivered projects, certain future projects, and contributions from same properties, is expected to contribute significant increases in rental income, net operating income, and cash flows. Operating performance assumptions related to the completion of our development and redevelopment projects in North America, including the timing of initial occupancy, stabilization dates, and Initial Stabilized Yield, are included in Item 2. Properties Value-Added Projects. Certain key assumptions regarding our projections, including the impact of various development and redevelopment projects, are included in the tables above and in the Development and Redevelopment Projects in North America table in Item 2. Properties Value-Added Projects and in Sources and Uses of Capital including the Construction Spending Projection table. The completion of our development and redevelopment projects will result in the increase of interest expense and other project costs, because these project costs will no longer qualify for capitalization and these costs will be expensed as incurred. Our projection assumptions for depreciation and amortization, general and administrative expenses, capitalization of interest, interest expense, net, and net operating income growth are included in the tables on this page and are subject to a number of variables and uncertainties, including those discussed under the Forward-looking Statements section of Part I, the Risk Factors section of Item 1A, and the Management Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations section under Item 7, of this annual report on Form 10-K for the year ended December 31, 2012. To the extent our full-year earnings guidance is updated during the year, we will provide additional disclosure supporting reasons for any significant changes to such guidance. 69 Table of Contents Liquidity and capital resources Overview We expect to meet certain long-term liquidity requirements, such as requirements for property acquisitions, development, redevelopment, other construction projects, capital improvements, tenant improvements, leasing costs, non-revenue-generating expenditures, and scheduled debt maturities, through net cash provided by operating activities, periodic asset sales, and long-term secured and unsecured indebtedness, including borrowings under our unsecured senior line of credit, unsecured senior bank term loans, and the issuance of additional debt and/or equity securities. We expect to continue meeting our short-term liquidity and capital requirements, as further detailed in this section, generally through our working capital and net cash provided by operating activities. We believe that the net cash provided by operating activities will continue to be sufficient to enable us to make the distributions necessary to continue qualifying as a REIT. Over the next several years, our balance sheet, capital structure, and liquidity objectives are as follows: Reduce leverage as a percentage of total gross assets and improve our ratio of debt to earnings before interest, taxes, depreciation, and amortization; Execute selective sales of operating and non-income producing assets as a source of capital while minimizing the issuance of common equity; Maintain diverse sources of capital, including sources from net cash flows from operating activities, unsecured debt, secured debt, selective asset sales, joint ventures, preferred stock, and common stock; Manage the amount of debt maturing in a single year; Refinance outstanding medium-term variable rate bank debt with longer-term fixed rate debt; Mitigate unhedged variable rate debt exposure by transitioning our balance sheet debt from short-term and medium-term variable rate bank debt to long-term unsecured fixed rate debt and utilizing interest rate swap agreements in the interim period during this transition of debt; Maintain adequate liquidity from net cash provided by operating activities, cash and cash equivalents, and available borrowing capacity under our unsecured senior line of credit; Maintain available borrowing capacity under our unsecured senior line of credit in excess of 50% of the total commitments of $1.5 billion, except temporarily as necessary; Fund preferred stock and common stock dividends from net cash provided by operating activities; Retain positive cash flows from operating activities after payment of dividends for reinvestment in acquisitions and/or development and redevelopment projects; and Reduce our non-income-producing assets as a percentage of our gross investment in real estate. Cash flows We report and analyze our cash flows based on operating activities, investing activities, and financing activities. The following table summarizes changes in the Company cash flows for the years ended December 31, 2012 and 2011 (in thousands): Year Ended December 31, 2012 2011 Change Net cash provided by operating activities $ 305,533 $ 246,960 $ 58,573 Net cash used in investing activities $ (558,100 ) $ (733,579 ) $ 175,479 Net cash provided by financing activities $ 314,860 $ 479,156 $ (164,296 ) 70 Table of Contents Operating activities Cash flows provided by operating activities consisted of the following amounts (in thousands): Year Ended December 31, 2012 2011 Change Net cash provided by operating activities $ 305,533 $ 246,960 $ 58,573 Changes in assets and liabilities (15,287 ) 39,586 (54,873 ) Net cash provided by operating activities before changes in assets and liabilities $ 290,246 $ 286,546 $ 3,700 Cash flows provided by operating activities are primarily dependent on the occupancy level of our asset base, rental rates of our leases, the collectability of rent and recovery of operating expenses from our tenants, and the amount of general and administrative costs. Net cash provided by operating activities for the year ended December 31, 2012, increased by $58.5 million, or 24%, to $305.5 million, compared to $247.0 million for the year ended December 31, 2011. The increase was primarily due to additional net operating income generated from our development and redevelopment projects completed since January 1, 2011. We believe our cash flows from operating activities provide a stable source of cash to fund operating expenses. As of December 31, 2012, approximately 94% of our leases (on a rentable square footage basis) were triple net leases, requiring client tenants to pay substantially all real estate taxes, insurance, utilities, common area expenses, and other operating expenses (including increases thereto) in addition to base rent. Our average occupancy rate for operating properties as of December 31, 2012, and December 31 of each year from 2000 to 2012 was approximately 95.0%. Our average occupancy rate for operating and redevelopment properties as of December 31, 2012, and December 31 of each year from 2000 to 2012 was approximately 88.8%. Investing activities Net cash used in investing activities for the year ended December 31, 2012, was $558.1 million, compared to $733.6 million for the year ended December 31, 2011. This change consisted of the following amounts (in thousands): Year Ended December 31, 2012 2011 Change Proceeds from sale of properties $ 36,179 $ 20,078 $ 16,101 Additions to properties (549,030 ) (430,038 ) (118,992 ) Purchase of properties (42,171 ) (305,030 ) 262,859 Other (3,078 ) (18,589 ) 15,511 Net cash used in investing activities $ (558,100 ) $ (733,579 ) $ 175,479 The change in net cash used in investing activities for the year ended December 31, 2012, is primarily due to a decrease in property acquisitions for the year ended December 31, 2012, as compared to the year ended December 31, 2011, offset by increased capital expenditures related to our development and redevelopment projects during the year ended December 31, 2012. Real estate asset sales See discussion in Sources of Capital Real Estate Asset Sales. Value-added opportunities and external growth As of December 31, 2012, 96% of our leases contained annual rent escalations that were either fixed or based on a consumer price index or another index. Our Initial Stabilized Yield on a cash basis reflects cash rents at date of stabilization and does not reflect contractual rent escalations beyond the stabilization date. We expect, on average, our contractual cash rents related to our value-added projects to increase over time. During the year ended December 31, 2012, we executed leases aggregating 699,000 and 436,000 rentable square feet, respectively, related to our development and redevelopment projects. 71 Table of Contents The following table summarizes the commencement of key development and redevelopment projects (dollars in thousands, except per square foot amounts): Investment Initial Commencement Rentable Pre-Leased at Per Stabilized Yield Key Address/Market Date Square Feet % Completion RSF Cash GAAP Client Tenant Development 75/125 Binney Street, Greater Boston 1Q13 386,275 (1) 63% (1) $ 351,439 $ 910 8.0% 8.2% ARIAD Pharmaceuticals, Inc. 430 East 29 th Street, Greater NYC November 2012 419,806 14% (2) $ 463,245 $ 1,103 6.6% 6.5% Roche 360 Longwood Avenue, Greater Boston April 2012 414,000 37% (3) $ 350,000 (4) $ 845 8.3% 8.9% Dana-Farber Cancer Institute, Inc.

As of December 31, 2012, commitments of $38.1 million were available under this loan. 4.60% unsecured senior notes payable offering In February 2012, we completed the issuance of our 4.60% Unsecured Senior Notes due in February 2022. Net proceeds of approximately $544.6 million were used to repay certain outstanding variable rate bank debt, including the entire $250.0 million of our 2012 Unsecured Senior Bank Term Loan, and approximately $294.6 million of outstanding borrowings under our unsecured senior line of credit. In connection with the retirement of our 2012 Unsecured Senior Bank Term Loan, we recognized a loss on early extinguishment of debt of approximately $0.6 million related to the write-off of unamortized loan fees for the three months ended March 31, 2012. 73 Table of Contents The requirements of, and our actual performance with respect to, the key financial covenants under our unsecured senior notes payable as of December 31, 2012, are as follows: Covenant Ratios (1) Requirement Actual (2) Total Debt to Total Assets Less than or equal to 60% 40% Consolidated EBITDA to interest expense Greater than or equal to 1.5x 5.7x Unencumbered Total Asset Value to Unsecured Debt Greater than or equal to 150% 250% Secured Debt to Total Assets Less than or equal to 40% 9% (1) For a definition of the ratios used in the table above, refer to the Indenture dated February 29, 2012, which governs the unsecured senior notes payable, which was filed as an exhibit to our Current Report on Form 8-K filed with the SEC on February 29, 2012. (2) Actual covenants are calculated pursuant to the specific terms of the Indenture. In addition, the terms of the Indenture, among other things, limit the ability of the Company, Alexandria Real Estate Equities, L.P., and the Company other subsidiaries to (a) consummate a merger, or consolidate or sell all or substantially all of the Company assets, and (b) incur certain secured or unsecured indebtedness. Debt repurchases, repayments, amendments, and losses on early extinguishments of debt The following table outlines certain debt repayments and amendments for the year ended December 31, 2012 (in thousands): Year Ended December 31, 2012 Losses on Early Debt Extinguishments Repayments of Debt Repurchase of 3.70% Unsecured Senior Convertible Notes Payable $ 84,801 $ Repayment of 2012 Unsecured Senior Bank Term Loan 250,000 623 Amendment of $1.5 billion unsecured senior line of credit 1,602 Repayments of secured notes payable 15,513 $ 350,314 $ 2,225 Repurchase of 3.70% unsecured senior convertible notes payable In January 2012, we repurchased approximately $83.8 million in principal amount of our 3.70% Unsecured Senior Convertible Notes at par, pursuant to options exercised by holders thereof under the indenture governing the notes. In April 2012, we repurchased the remaining outstanding $1.0 million in principal amount of the notes. In aggregate, we repurchased approximately $84.8 million in principal amount of the notes, and we did not recognize a gain or loss as a result during the year ended December 31, 2012. Repayment of 2012 Unsecured Senior Bank Term Loan In February 2012, we repaid the entire $250.0 million outstanding balance on our 2012 Unsecured Senior Bank Term Loan. In connection with the retirement of our 2012 Unsecured Senior Bank Term Loan, we recognized a loss on early extinguishment of debt of approximately $0.6 million related to the write-off of unamortized loan fees for the three months ended March 31, 2012. Amendment of $1.5 billion unsecured senior line of credit In April 2012, we amended our $1.5 billion unsecured senior line of credit with Merrill Lynch, Pierce, Fenner & Smith Incorporated, J.P. Morgan Securities Inc., and Citigroup Global Markets Inc. as joint lead arrangers, and certain lenders, to extend the maturity date of our unsecured senior line of credit, provide an accordion option for up to an additional $500 million, and reduce the interest rate for outstanding borrowings. The maturity date of the unsecured senior line of credit was extended to April 2017, assuming we exercise our sole right to extend the stated maturity date twice by an additional six months after each exercise. Borrowings under the unsecured senior line of credit will bear interest at LIBOR or the base rate specified in the amended unsecured senior line of credit agreement, plus in either case the Applicable Margin. The Applicable Margin for LIBOR borrowings under the unsecured senior line of credit was set at 1.20%, down from the 2.40% in effect immediately prior to the modification. In addition to the Applicable Margin, our unsecured senior line of credit is subject to an annual facility fee of 0.25% based on the aggregate commitments outstanding. In connection with the modification of our unsecured senior line of credit in April 2012, we recognized a loss on early extinguishment of debt of approximately $1.6 million related to the write-off of a portion of unamortized loan fees for the three months ended June 30, 2012. 74 Table of Contents The requirements of, and our actual performance with respect to, the key financial covenants under our unsecured senior line of credit as of December 31, 2012, are as follows: Covenant Ratios (1) Requirement Actual Leverage Ratio Less than or equal to 60.0% 37% Fixed Charge Coverage Ratio Greater than or equal to 1.50x 2.5x Secured Debt Ratio Less than or equal to 40.0% 8% Unsecured Leverage Ratio Less than or equal to 60.0% 43% Unsecured Interest Coverage Ratio Greater than or equal to 1.75x 7.4x (1) For a definition of the ratios used in the table above, refer to the amended unsecured senior line of credit and unsecured senior bank term loan agreements, dated as of April 30, 2012, which is filed as an exhibit to our Quarterly Report on Form 10-Q filed with the SEC on August 8, 2012. Repayments of secured notes payable In December 2012, we repaid two secured notes payable with maturity dates in 2013 and aggregate balances of $15.5 million. No prepayment penalty was required related to early retirement of these secured notes payable. During the year ended December 31, 2012, we also made scheduled principal amortization repayments in the amount of $10.9 million. At the market common stock offering program In June 2012, we established an at the market common stock offering program under which we may sell, from time to time, up to an aggregate of $250.0 million of our common stock through our sales agents, BNY Mellon Capital Markets, LLC and Credit Suisse Securities (USA) LLC, during a three-year period. During the year ended December 31, 2012, we sold an aggregate of 1,366,977 shares of common stock for gross proceeds of approximately $100.0 million at an average stock price of $73.15 and net proceeds of approximately $97.9 million, including commissions and other expenses of approximately $2.1 million. Net proceeds from the sales were used to pay down the outstanding balance on our senior unsecured senior line of credit or other borrowings, and for general corporate purposes. As of December 31, 2012, approximately $150.0 million of our common stock remained available for issuance under the at the market common stock offering program. 8.375% series C preferred stock redemption In April 2012, we redeemed all 5,185,500 outstanding shares of our Series C Preferred Stock at a price equal to $25.00 per share, or approximately $129.6 million in aggregate, and paid $0.5234375 per share, representing accumulated and unpaid dividends to the redemption date on such shares. We announced the redemption and recognized a preferred stock redemption charge of approximately $6.0 million to net income attributable to Alexandria Real Estate Equities, Inc. common stockholders in March 2012, related to the write-off of original issuance costs of the Series C Preferred Stock. 6.45% series E preferred stock offering In March 2012, we completed a public offering of 5,200,000 shares of our Series E Preferred Stock. The shares were issued at a price of $25.00 per share, resulting in net proceeds of approximately $124.9 million (after deducting underwriters discounts and other offering costs). The proceeds were initially used to reduce the outstanding borrowings under our unsecured senior line of credit. We then borrowed funds under our unsecured senior line of credit to redeem our Series C Preferred Stock. 75 Table of Contents Dividends During the year ended December 31, 2012 and 2011, we paid the following dividends (in thousands): Year Ended December 31, 2012 2011 Change Common stock dividends $ 126,498 $ 106,889 $ 19,609 Series C Preferred Stock dividends 5,428 10,857 (5,429 ) Series D Preferred Stock dividends 17,500 17,500 Series E Preferred Stock dividends 4,891 4,891 $ 154,317 $ 135,246 $ 19,071 The increase in dividends paid on our common stock is due to an increase in the related dividends to $2.02 per common share for the year ended December 31, 2012, from $1.82 per common share for the year ended December 31, 2011. The increase was also due to an increase in common stock outstanding. Total common stock outstanding as of December 31, 2012, was 63,244,645 shares, compared to 61,560,472 shares as of December 31, 2011. Sources and uses of capital We expect that our principal liquidity needs for the year ended December 31, 2013, will be satisfied by the following multiple sources of capital as shown in the table below. There can be no assurance that our sources and uses of capital will not be materially higher or lower than these expectations. Our liquidity available under our unsecured senior line of credit and from cash equivalents was approximately $1.1 billion as of December 31, 2012. Reported on February 7, 2013 Reported on December 5, 2012 Sources and Uses of Capital for the Year Ended December 31, 2013 (in millions) Completed Projected Total Total Sources of capital: Net cash provided by operating activities less dividends $ $ 130 - 150 $ 130 - 150 (1) $ 130 - 150 2013 asset sales initially targeted for 4Q12 closing 43 34 77 2013 asset sales initially projected on December 5, 2012 (2) Non-income-producing 175 - 225 (3) 175 - 225 (3) 175 - 225 Income-producing 41 34 - 84 75 - 125 75 - 125 Secured construction loan borrowing 20 - 30 20 - 30 20 - 30 Unsecured senior notes 350 - 450 350 - 450 350 - 450 Issuances under at the market common stock offering program 125 - 175 125 - 175 125 - 175 Total sources of capital $ 84 $ 868 - 1,148 $ 952 - 1,232 $ 875 - 1,155 Uses of capital: Development, redevelopment, and construction $ $ 545 - 595 $ 545 - 595 (4) $ 545 - 595 Seller financing of asset sales 39 39 Acquisitions (5) Secured notes payable repayments (6) 37 37 52 Unsecured senior bank term loan repayment 125 - 175 125 - 175 125 - 175 Paydown of unsecured senior line of credit 45 161 - 341 206 - 386 153 - 333 Total uses of capital $ 84 $ 868 - 1,148 $ 952 - 1,232 $ 875 - 1,155 (1) See Projection Results Key Projection Assumptions. (2) A portion of our projected 2013 asset sales is under negotiation and we expect to identify the remainder of the assets for disposition in the first half of 2013 in order to achieve our targeted dispositions. (3) Our guidance has assumed transfer of 50% of our ownership interest in the 75/125 Binney Street project to be accounted for as an in-substance partial sale of an interest in a land parcel, with the resulting entity presented as an unconsolidated joint venture (the Binney JV ) in our financial statements. This sale of a land parcel is included in our total projected asset sales for 2013. (4) See Investment to Complete columns in the Development and Redevelopment Projects in North America table in Item 2. Properties Value-Added Projects section for additional details underlying this estimate. Our guidance for 2013 development, redevelopment, and construction spending of $545 to $595 million includes our estimated share of incremental capital required to complete the 75/125 Binney Street Project. See Development and Redevelopment Projects in North America table in Item 2. Properties Value-Added Projects section for additional details on the 75/125 Binney Street Project. (5) Our guidance has assumed no acquisitions, but we review opportunistic acquisitions that we expect to fund on a leverage-neutral basis. (6) The reduction in projected secured notes payable of $15 million is related to two loans that were repaid in 2012 prior to their contractual maturity dates in 2013. The key assumptions behind the sources and uses of capital in the table above are a favorable capital market environment and performance of our core operations in areas such as delivery of current and future development and redevelopment projects, leasing activity, and renewals. Our expected sources and uses of capital are subject to a number of variables and uncertainties, including those discussed under the Forward-looking statements section of Part I, the Risk Factors section of Item 1A, and the Management Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations section under Item 7, of this annual report on Form 10-K for the year ended December 31, 2012. We expect to update our forecast of sources and uses of capital on a quarterly basis. 76 Table of Contents Sources of capital Unsecured senior line of credit We use our unsecured senior line of credit to fund working capital, construction activities, and, from time to time, acquisition of properties. As of December 31, 2012, we had $0.9 billion available under our $1.5 billion unsecured senior line of credit. Cash and cash equivalents As of December 31, 2012, we had approximately $141.0 million of cash and cash equivalents. We expect existing cash and cash equivalents, cash flows from operating activities, proceeds from asset sales, secured construction loan and unsecured senior notes payable borrowings, and issuances of common stock under our at the market common stock offering program to continue to be sufficient to fund our operating activities and cash commitments for investing and financing activities, such as regular quarterly dividends, scheduled debt repayments, and material capital expenditures, for at least the next 12 months, and thereafter for the foreseeable future. Restricted cash Restricted cash consisted of the following as of December 31, 2012 and 2011 (in thousands): December 31, 2012 December 31, 2011 Funds held in trust under the terms of certain secured notes payable $ 29,526 $ 12,724 Funds held in escrow related to construction projects 5,652 5,648 Other restricted funds 4,769 4,960 Total $ 39,947 $ 23,332 The funds held in escrow related to construction projects will be used to pay for certain construction costs. Real estate asset sales We continue the disciplined execution of our asset recycling program to monetize non-strategic operating and non-income-producing assets as a source of capital while minimizing the issuance of common equity. We target the following asset types for sale and redeploy the capital to fund active development and redevelopment projects with significant pre-leasing: Older buildings: elimination of potential capital expenditures and leasing risk; Non-strategic assets: disposition of properties not proximate to academic medical research centers in core life science cluster locations; Assets with alternative uses for buyer: transformation into non-laboratory space, such as medical office buildings, hospitals, and residential spaces; Suburban locations: reinvestment in higher value, Class-A assets in urban brain trust life science cluster locations; or Excess land: reduction of non-income-producing land holdings in certain clusters, while maintaining specific land parcels for future growth. 77 Table of Contents A portion of our projected 2013 asset sales is under negotiation and we expect to identify the remainder of the assets for disposition in the first half of 2013 in order to seek to achieve our target dispositions. Consistent with our asset recycling strategy described on the preceding page, asset sales completed from January 1, 2013 through February 21, 2013 (see table below), were comprised of the following: Older buildings: properties acquired prior to our May 1997 initial public offering or properties acquired shortly thereafter in the late nineties; and Each of these assets had either near term rollover with projected decreases in occupancy and/or requires large capital investment to re-tenant and/or reposition. The weighted average occupancy for these assets was 90.1% at the date of sale and projected to decline to approximately 55.4% by the end of 2013. Consequently, the net operating income for these assets is projected to significantly decrease during 2013. The projected aggregate annualized GAAP NOI for the three months ended December 31, 2013, related to these sales was anticipated to be approximately $8.5 million with an average weighted average implied yield (GAAP NOI divided by sales price) of 6.7%. Suburban locations: substantially all of these properties are located in suburban locations and were part of our initial entry into each of these sub-markets. We believe recycling proceeds from these sales into our current developments in higher value Class-A assets located in urban brain trust life science cluster locations will generate higher long-term value. The following table presents our completed real estate asset sales (dollars in thousands, except per square foot amounts): Rentable/ Sales Occupancy Annualized Date Developable Price at Date GAAP Sales Gain Description Location of Sale Square Feet per SF of Sale NOI (1) Price on Sale Sales completed in 2012 1201/1209 Mercer Street (2) Seattle September 2012 76,029 $ 73 0% $ 45 $ 5,570 $ 54 801 Dexter Avenue North (2) Seattle August 2012 120,000 $ 72 0% $ (96) 8,600 $ 55 200 Lawrence Drive/210 Welsh Pool Road Pennsylvania July 2012 210,866 $ 94 100% $ 2,193 19,750 (3) $ 103 155 Fortune Boulevard (4) Route 495/Worcester July 2012 36,000 $ 222 100% $ 804 8,000 $ 1,350 5110 Campus Drive (4) Pennsylvania May 2012 21,000 $ 86 71% $ 77 1,800 $ 2 Land parcel Greater Boston March 2012 (5) $ 275 N/A N/A 31,360 $ 1,864 Sales completed in 2012 75,080 Sales completed in 1Q13 1124 Columbia Street Seattle January 2013 203,817 $ 209 81% (6) $ 6,802 42,600 $ 25/35/45 West Watkins Mill Road/1201 Clopper Road (7) Suburban Washington D.C.

(2) Properties sold to residential developers. (3) Sales price reflects the near-term lease expiration of a client tenant occupying 38,513 rentable square feet, or 18% of the total rentable square feet, on the date of sale. In connection with the sale, we received a secured note receivable for $6.1 million with a maturity date in 2018. (4) Properties were sold to client tenants. (5) In March 2012, we completed an in-substance partial sale of our interest in underlying real estate supporting a project with 414,000 rentable square feet for approximately $31.4 million, or approximately $275 per rentable square foot. (6) The property is expected to become 74% vacant in 2013 and the current buyer is expected to significantly renovate the property into medical office use. The sales price of 1124 Columbia Street includes a $29.8 million secured note receivable due in 2015 with an option to extend the maturity date by one year. As of December 31, 2012, this property is classified in discontinued operations. (7) These properties met the classification for discontinued operations in January 2013 and were classified as operating properties as of December 31, 2012. We completed the sale on February 1, 2013, and recognized a $0.1 million gain upon the closing of the transaction. (8) These properties are expected to become 17% vacant in 2013, with significant additional vacancy in subsequent years, and the buyer is expected to significantly renovate the property at 1201 Clopper Road. Secured construction loan In June 2012, we closed a secured construction loan with aggregate commitments of $55.0 million. The construction loan matures in July 2015, and we have an option to extend the stated maturity date of July 1, 2015, by one year, twice, to July 1, 2017. The construction loan bears interest at LIBOR or Base Rate, plus in either case a specified margin of 1.50% for LIBOR borrowings or 0.25% for Base Rate borrowings. As of December 31, 2012, commitments of $38.1 million were available under this loan.

(2) Amounts include indirect project costs, including interest, property taxes, insurance, and payroll costs. (3) Estimated spending beyond 2013 will be determined at a future date and is contingent upon many factors. (4) Represents, among others, future projected construction projects in North America, including a future ground-up development at 75/125 Binney Street, and future redevelopment projects at 3013/3033 Science Park Road. There can be no assurance that our projected capital expenditures will not be materially lower or higher than these expectations. 79 Table of Contents The table below shows the average per square foot property-related non-revenue-enhancing capital expenditures, tenant improvements, and leasing costs (excluding capital expenditures and tenant improvements that are recoverable from client tenants, revenue-enhancing, or related to properties that have undergone redevelopment) during the years ended December 31, 2012 and 2011: Year Ended December 31, Non-revenue-enhancing capital expenditures (1): 2012 2011 Major capital expenditures $ 223,737 $ 640,699 Other building improvements $ 1,844,708 $ 1,889,962 Square feet in asset base 14,115,129 13,384,598 Per square foot: Major capital expenditures $ 0.02 $ 0.05 Other building improvements $ 0.13 $ 0.14 Tenant improvements and leasing costs: Re-tenanted space (2) Tenant improvements and leasing costs $ 2,672,823 $ 4,570,595 Re-tenanted square feet 284,263 512,573 Per square foot $ 9.40 $ 8.92 Renewal space Tenant improvements and leasing costs $ 6,508,352 $ 6,028,995 Renewal square feet 1,191,140 1,309,293 Per square foot $ 5.46 $ 4.60 (1) Major capital expenditures typically consist of significant improvements such as roof and HVAC systems replacements. Other building improvements exclude major capital expenditures. (2) Excludes space that has undergone redevelopment before re-tenanting. We expect our future capital expenditures, tenant improvements, and leasing costs (excluding capital expenditures and tenant improvements that are recoverable from client tenants, revenue-enhancing, or related to properties that have undergone redevelopment) on a per square foot basis to be approximately in the amounts shown in the preceding table. Capitalized interest for the year ended December 31, 2012 and 2011, of approximately $62.8 million and $61.1 million, respectively, is classified in investments in real estate, net, as well as the table on the preceding page summarizing total capital expenditures. In addition, we capitalized payroll and other indirect project costs related to development, redevelopment, and construction projects, including projects in India and China, aggregating approximately $13.4 million and $17.0 million for the year ended December 31, 2012 and 2011, respectively. Such costs are also included in the Summary of Capital Expenditures section on the preceding page. We capitalize interest cost as a cost of the project only during the period for which activities necessary to prepare an asset for its intended use are ongoing, provided that expenditures for the asset have been made and interest cost has been incurred. Indirect project costs, including construction administration, legal fees, and office costs that clearly relate to projects under development or construction, are capitalized as incurred during the period an asset is undergoing activities to prepare it for its intended use. Additionally, should activities necessary to prepare an asset for its intended use cease, interest, taxes, insurance, and certain other direct project costs related to this asset would be expensed as incurred. When construction activities cease and the asset is ready for its intended use, the asset is transferred out of construction in progress and classified as rental properties, net. Additionally, if vertical aboveground construction is not initiated at completion of preconstruction activities, the land parcel will be classified as land held for future development. Expenditures for repairs and maintenance are expensed as incurred. Fluctuations in our development, redevelopment, and construction activities could result in significant changes to total expenses and net income. For example, had we experienced a 10% reduction in development, redevelopment, and construction activities without a corresponding decrease in indirect project costs, including interest and payroll, total expenses would have increased by approximately $7.5 million for the year ended December 31, 2012. We also capitalize and defer initial direct costs to originate leases with independent third parties related to evaluating a prospective lessee financial condition, negotiating lease terms, preparing the lease agreement, and closing the lease transaction. Costs that we have capitalized and deferred relate to successful leasing transactions, result directly from and are essential to the lease transaction, and would not have been incurred had that leasing transaction not occurred. The initial direct costs capitalized and deferred also include the portion of our employees total compensation and payroll-related fringe benefits directly related to time spent performing activities previously described and related to the respective lease that would not have been performed but for that lease. Total initial direct leasing costs capitalized during the year ended December 31, 2012 and 2011, were approximately $45.9 million and $57.5 million, respectively, of which approximately $10.6 million and $11.6 million, respectively, represented capitalized and deferred payroll costs directly related and essential to our leasing activities during such periods. 80 Table of Contents Retirement of 3.70% unsecured senior convertible notes See discussion in Cash Flows Financing Activities Retirement of 3.70% Unsecured Senior Convertible Notes. Acquisitions Refer to Liquidity and Capital Resources Acquisitions. Dividends We are required to distribute 90% of our REIT taxable income on an annual basis in order to continue to qualify as a REIT for federal income tax purposes. Accordingly, we intend to make, but are not contractually bound to make, regular quarterly distributions to preferred and common stockholders from cash flow from operating activities. All such distributions are at the discretion of our Board of Directors. We may be required to use borrowings under our unsecured senior line of credit, if necessary, to meet REIT distribution requirements and maintain our REIT status. We consider market factors and our performance in addition to REIT requirements in determining distribution levels. Our forecasts of taxable income and distributions do not require significant increases in our annual common stock dividends on a per share basis in order to distribute at least 90% of our REIT taxable income for the period January 1, 2013, through December 31, 2013.

See discussion at Note 5, Secured and Unsecured Senior Debt, for additional information. (3) The maturity date of our unsecured senior line of credit is April 30, 2017, assuming we exercise our sole right to extend the maturity date of April 30, 2016, twice by an additional six months. (4) Our 2016 unsecured senior bank term loan ( 2016 Unsecured Senior Bank Term Loan ) matures June 30, 2016, assuming we exercise our sole right to extend the maturity date of June 30, 2015, by one year. (5) Our 2017 unsecured senior bank term loan ( 2017 Unsecured Senior Bank Term Loan ) matures January 31, 2017, assuming we exercise our sole right to extend the maturity date of January 31, 2016, by one year. (6) Estimated interest payments on our fixed rate debt and hedged variable rate debt were based upon contractual interest rates, including the impact of interest rate swap agreements, interest payment dates, and scheduled maturity dates. (7) The interest payments on variable rate debt were based on the interest rates in effect as of December 31, 2012. 81 Table of Contents Secured notes payable Secured notes payable as of December 31, 2012, consisted of 14 notes secured by 38 properties. Our secured notes payable typically require monthly payments of principal and interest and had weighted average interest rates of approximately 5.65% as of December 31, 2012. Noncontrolling interests share of secured notes payable aggregated approximately $21.3 million as of December 31, 2012. The total book values of rental properties, net, land held for future development, and construction in progress securing debt were approximately $1.3 billion as of December 31, 2012. As of December 31, 2012, our secured notes payable, including unamortized discounts, were composed of approximately $623.2 million and $93.4 million of fixed and variable rate debt, respectively. Estimated interest payments Estimated interest payments on our fixed rate debt and hedged variable rate debt were calculated based upon contractual interest rates, including the impact of interest rate swap agreements, interest payment dates, and scheduled maturity dates. As of December 31, 2012, approximately 70% of our debt was fixed rate debt or variable rate debt subject to interest rate swap agreements. See additional information regarding our interest rate swap agreements under Liquidity and Capital Resources Contractual Obligations and Commitments Interest Rate Swap Agreements. The remaining 30% of our debt is unhedged variable rate debt based primarily on LIBOR. Interest payments on our unhedged variable rate debt have been calculated based on interest rates in effect as of December 31, 2012. See additional information regarding our debt under Note 6, Secured and Unsecured Debt, to our consolidated financial statements appearing elsewhere in this annual report on Form 10-K. Ground lease obligations Ground lease obligations as of December 31, 2012, included leases for 25 of our properties and four land development parcels. Excluding one ground lease related to one operating property that expires in 2036 with a net book value of approximately $8.4 million at December 31, 2012, our ground lease obligations have remaining lease terms ranging from 41 to 196 years, including extension options. Commitments In addition to the above, as of December 31, 2012, remaining aggregate costs under contract for the construction of properties undergoing development, redevelopment, and generic life science infrastructure improvements under the terms of leases approximated $239.4 million. We expect payments for these obligations to occur over one to three years, subject to capital planning adjustments from time to time. We are also committed to funding approximately $55.5 million for certain investments over the next six years. A 100% owned subsidiary of the Company previously executed a ground lease, as ground lessee, for certain property in New York City. The West Tower of the Alexandria Center for Life Science New York City will be constructed on such ground leased property. In November 2012, we commenced vertical construction of the West Tower of the Alexandria Center for Life Science New York City. The ground lease provides further that substantial completion of the West Tower of the Alexandria Center for Life Science New York City occur by October 31, 2015, requiring satisfying conditions that include substantially completed construction in accordance with the plans and the issuance of either temporary or permanent certificates of occupancy for the core and shell. The ground lease also provides that by October 31, 2016, the ground lessee obtain a temporary or permanent certificate of occupancy for the core and shell of both the East Tower of the Alexandria Center for Life Science New York City (which has occurred) and the West Tower of the Alexandria Center for Life Science New York City. In each case, the target dates above are subject to force majeure, to contractual cure rights, to other legal remedies available to ground lessees generally, and to change for any reason by agreement between both parties under the ground lease. Lastly, if the above dates are not met, the ground lease provides contractual cure rights and the ground lease does not provide for the payment of additional rent, a late fee, or other monetary penalty. Off-balance sheet arrangements Our off-balance sheet arrangements consist of our investment in a real estate entity that is a variable interest entity for which we are not the primary beneficiary. We account for the real estate entity under the equity method. The debt held by the unconsolidated real estate entity is secured by the land parcel owned by the entity, and is non-recourse to us. See Notes 2 and 3 to our consolidated financial statements appearing elsewhere in this annual report on Form 10-K. 82 Table of Contents Interest rate swap agreements We utilize interest rate swap agreements to hedge a portion of our exposure to variable interest rates primarily associated with our unsecured senior line of credit and unsecured senior bank term loans. These agreements involve an exchange of fixed and variable rate interest payments without the exchange of the underlying principal amount (the notional amount ). Interest received under all of our interest rate swap agreements is based on the one-month LIBOR rate. The net difference between the interest paid and the interest received is reflected as an adjustment to interest expense. The following table summarizes our interest rate swap agreements as of December 31, 2012 (in thousands): Interest Pay Fair Value as of Notional Amount in Effect as of Transaction Date Effective Date Termination Date Rate (1) December 31, 2012 (2) December 31, 2012 December 31, 2013 December 2006 December 29, 2006 March 31, 2014 4.990% $ (2,991 ) $ 50,000 $ 50,000 October 2007 October 31, 2007 September 30, 2013 4.642% (1,672 ) 50,000 October 2007 July 1, 2008 March 31, 2013 4.622% (264 ) 25,000 October 2007 July 1, 2008 March 31, 2013 4.625% (264 ) 25,000 December 2006 November 30, 2009 March 31, 2014 5.015% (4,510 ) 75,000 75,000 December 2006 November 30, 2009 March 31, 2014 5.023% (4,518 ) 75,000 75,000 December 2011 December 31, 2012 December 31, 2013 0.640% (1,057 ) 250,000 December 2011 December 31, 2012 December 31, 2013 0.640% (1,057 ) 250,000 December 2011 December 31, 2012 December 31, 2013 0.644% (533 ) 125,000 December 2011 December 31, 2012 December 31, 2013 0.644% (533 ) 125,000 December 2011 December 31, 2013 December 31, 2014 0.977% (1,632 ) 250,000 December 2011 December 31, 2013 December 31, 2014 0.976% (1,630 ) 250,000 Total $ (20,661 ) $ 1,050,000 $ 700,000 (1) In addition to the interest pay rate, borrowings outstanding under our unsecured senior line of credit and unsecured senior bank term loans include an applicable margin currently ranging from 1.20% to 1.75%. (2) Including accrued interest and credit valuation adjustment. We have entered into master derivative agreements with each counterparty. These master derivative agreements (all of which are adapted from the standard International Swaps and Derivatives Association, Inc. form) define certain terms between the Company and each counterparty to address and minimize certain risks associated with our interest rate swap agreements. In order to limit our risk of non-performance by an individual counterparty under our interest rate swap agreements, our interest rate swap agreements are spread among various counterparties. As of December 31, 2012 and 2011, the largest aggregate notional amount of interest rate swap agreements in effect at any single point in time with an individual counterparty was $375.0 million. If one or more of our counterparties fail to perform under our interest rate swap agreements, we may incur higher costs associated with our variable rate LIBOR-based debt than the interest costs we originally anticipated. As of December 31, 2012, the fair values of our interest rate swap agreements were classified in accounts payable, accrued expenses, and tenant security deposits based upon their respective fair values, aggregating a liability balance of approximately $20.7 million, with the offsetting adjustment reflected as unrealized losses in accumulated other comprehensive loss in total equity. Balances in accumulated other comprehensive loss are recognized in the period during which the hedged transactions affect earnings. We have not posted any collateral related to our interest rate swap agreements. For the years ended December 31, 2012, 2011, and 2010, approximately $22.3 million, $21.5 million, and $30.6 million, respectively, was reclassified from accumulated other comprehensive income to interest expense as an increase to interest expense. During the next 12 months, we expect to reclassify approximately $15.1 million from accumulated other comprehensive loss to interest expense as an increase to interest expense. 83 Table of Contents Other resources and liquidity requirements Under our current shelf registration statement filed with the SEC, we may offer common stock, preferred stock, debt, and other securities. These securities may be issued from time to time at our discretion based on our needs and market conditions, including as necessary to balance our use of incremental debt capital. We hold interests, together with certain third parties, in companies that we consolidate in our financial statements. These third parties may contribute equity into these entities primarily related to their share of funds for construction and financing-related activities. Exposure to environmental liabilities In connection with the acquisition of all of our properties, we have obtained Phase I environmental assessments to ascertain the existence of any environmental liabilities or other issues. The Phase I environmental assessments of our properties have not revealed any environmental liabilities that we believe would have a material adverse effect on our financial condition or results of operations taken as a whole, nor are we aware of any material environmental liabilities that have occurred since the Phase I environmental assessments were completed. In addition, we carry a policy of pollution legal liability insurance covering exposure to certain environmental losses at substantially all of our properties. Inflation As of December 31, 2012, approximately 94% of our leases (on a rentable square footage basis) were triple net leases, requiring client tenants to pay substantially all real estate taxes, insurance, utilities, common area expenses, and other operating expenses (including increases thereto) in addition to base rent. Approximately 96% of our leases (on a rentable square footage basis) contained effective annual rent escalations that were either fixed (generally ranging from 3.0% to 3.5%) or indexed based on a consumer price index or another index. Accordingly, we do not believe that our cash flow or earnings from real estate operations are subject to any significant risk from inflation. An increase in inflation, however, could result in an increase in the cost of our variable rate borrowings, including borrowings related to our unsecured senior line of credit and unsecured senior bank term loans. 84 Table of Contents Non-GAAP measures FFO and FFO, as adjusted GAAP basis accounting for real estate assets utilizes historical cost accounting and assumes that real estate values diminish over time. In an effort to overcome the difference between real estate values and historical cost accounting for real estate assets, the Board of Governors of NAREIT established the measurement tool of FFO. Since its introduction, FFO has become a widely used non-GAAP financial measure among equity REITs. We believe that FFO is helpful to investors as an additional measure of the performance of an equity REIT. Moreover, we believe that FFO, as adjusted, is also helpful because it allows investors to compare our performance to the performance of other real estate companies between periods, and on a consistent basis, without having to account for differences caused by investment and disposition decisions, financing decisions, terms of securities, capital structures, and capital market transactions. We compute FFO in accordance with standards established by the Board of Governors of NAREIT in its NAREIT White Paper. The NAREIT White Paper defines FFO as net income (computed in accordance with GAAP), excluding gains (losses) from sales of depreciable real estate and land parcels and impairments of depreciable real estate (excluding land parcels), plus real estate related depreciation and amortization, and after adjustments for unconsolidated partnerships and joint ventures. Impairments of real estate relate to decreases in the estimated fair value of real estate due to changes in general market conditions and do not necessarily reflect the operating performance of the properties during the corresponding period. Impairments of real estate represent the non-cash write-down of assets when fair value over the recoverability period is less than the carrying value. We compute FFO, as adjusted, as FFO calculated in accordance with the NAREIT White Paper, plus losses on early extinguishment of debt, preferred stock redemption charges, and impairments of land parcels, less realized gain on equity investment primarily related to one non-tenant life science entity, and the amount of such items which are allocable to our unvested restricted stock awards. Our calculations of both FFO and FFO, as adjusted, may differ from those methodologies utilized by other equity REITs for similar performance measurements, and, accordingly, may not be comparable to other equity REITs. Neither FFO nor FFO, as adjusted, should be considered as an alternative to net income (determined in accordance with GAAP) as an indication of financial performance, or to cash flows from operating activities (determined in accordance with GAAP) as a measure of liquidity, nor are they indicative of the availability of funds for our cash needs, including funds available to make distributions. Adjusted funds from operations ( AFFO ) AFFO is a non-GAAP financial measure that we use as a supplemental measure of our performance. We compute AFFO by adding to or deducting from FFO, as adjusted: (1) non-revenue-enhancing capital expenditures, tenant improvements, and leasing commissions (excludes development and redevelopment expenditures); (2) effects of straight-line rent and straight-line rent on ground leases; (3) capitalized income from development projects; (4) amortization of acquired above and below market leases, loan fees, and debt premiums/discounts; (5) non-cash compensation expense; and (6) allocation of AFFO attributable to unvested restricted stock awards. We believe that AFFO is a useful supplemental performance measure because it further adjusts to: (1) deduct certain expenditures that, although capitalized and classified in depreciation expense, do not enhance the revenue or cash flows of our properties; (2) eliminate the effect of straight-lining our rental income and capitalizing income from development projects in order to reflect the actual amount of contractual rents due in the period presented; and (3) eliminate the effect of non-cash items that are not indicative of our core operations and do not actually reduce the amount of cash generated by our operations. We believe that eliminating the effect of non-cash charges related to stock-based compensation facilitates a comparison of our operations across periods and among other equity REITs without the variances caused by different valuation methodologies, the volatility of the expense (which depends on market forces outside our control), and the assumptions and the variety of award types that a company can use. We believe that AFFO provides useful information by excluding certain items that are not representative of our core operating results because such items are dependent upon historical costs or subject to judgmental valuation inputs and the timing of our decisions. AFFO is not intended to represent cash flow for the period, and is intended only to provide an additional measure of performance. We believe that net income attributable to Alexandria Real Estate Equities, Inc. common stockholders is the most directly comparable GAAP financial measure to AFFO. We believe that AFFO is a widely recognized measure of the operations of equity REITs, and presenting AFFO will enable investors to assess our performance in comparison to other equity REITs. However, other equity REITs may use different methodologies for calculating AFFO and, accordingly, our AFFO may not be comparable to AFFO calculated by other equity REITs. AFFO should not be considered as an alternative to net income (determined in accordance with GAAP) as an indication of financial performance, or to cash flows from operating activities (determined in accordance with GAAP) as a measure of our liquidity, nor is it indicative of funds available to fund our cash needs, including our ability to make distributions. 85 Table of Contents The following table presents a reconciliation of net income attributable to Alexandria Real Estate Equities, Inc. common stockholders -

We use Adjusted EBITDA and Adjusted EBITDA margins to assess the performance of our core operations, for financial and operational decision making, and as a supplemental or additional means of evaluating period-to-period comparisons on a consistent basis. Adjusted EBITDA also serves as a proxy for a component of a financial covenant under certain of our debt obligations. Adjusted EBITDA is calculated as EBITDA excluding net stock compensation expense, gains or losses on early extinguishment of debt, gains or losses on sales of real estate, gains or losses on sales of land parcels, impairments of real estate, and impairments of land parcels. We believe Adjusted EBITDA and Adjusted EBITDA margins provide investors relevant and useful information because they permit investors to view income from our operations on an unleveraged basis before the effects of taxes, non-cash depreciation and amortization, net stock compensation expense, gains or losses on early extinguishment of debt, gains or losses on sales of real estate, gains or losses on sales of land parcels, impairments of real estate, and impairments of land parcels. By excluding interest expense and gains or losses on early extinguishment of debt, EBITDA, Adjusted EBITDA, and Adjusted EBITDA margins allow investors to measure our performance independent of our capital structure and indebtedness and, therefore, allow for a more meaningful comparison of our performance to that of other companies, both in the real estate industry and in other industries. We believe that excluding non-cash charges related to stock-based compensation facilitates a comparison of our operations across periods and among other equity REITs without the variances caused by different valuation methodologies, the volatility of the expense (which depends on market forces outside our control), and the assumptions and the variety of award types that a company can use. We believe that adjusting for the effects of gains or losses on sales of real estate, gains or losses on sales of land parcels, impairments of real estate, and impairments of land parcels provides useful information by excluding certain items that are not representative of our core operating results. These items are dependent upon historical costs, subject to judgmental inputs and the timing of our decisions. EBITDA, Adjusted EBITDA, and Adjusted EBITDA margins have limitations as measures of our performance. EBITDA, Adjusted EBITDA, and Adjusted EBITDA margins do not reflect our historical cash expenditures or future cash requirements for capital expenditures or contractual commitments. While EBITDA, Adjusted EBITDA, and Adjusted EBITDA margins are relevant and widely used measures of performance, they do not represent net income or cash flows from operations as defined by GAAP, and they should not be considered as alternatives to those indicators in evaluating performance or liquidity. Further, our computation of EBITDA, Adjusted EBITDA, and Adjusted EBITDA margins may not be comparable to similar measures reported by other companies. We believe the EBITDA, Adjusted EBITDA, and Adjusted EBITDA margins for the three months ended December 31, 2012 and 2011, annualized, reflect the completion of our development and redevelopment projects and are indicative of the Company current operating trends. During the three months ended December 31, 2012, we completed a number of development and redevelopment projects which significantly increased our NOI for the period. The following table reconciles net income, the most directly comparable financial measure calculated and presented in accordance with GAAP, to EBITDA, Adjusted EBITDA, and Adjusted EBITDA margins (dollars in thousands): Three Months Ended December 31, Year Ended December 31, 2012 2011 2012 2011 Net income $ 28,807 $ 35,462 $ 105,528 $ 135,393 Interest expense continuing operations 17,941 14,757 69,184 63,378 Interest expense discontinued operations 65 Depreciation and amortization continuing operations 48,072 39,762 188,850 153,087 Depreciation and amortization discontinued operations 1,204 3,155 4,939 EBITDA 94,820 91,185 366,717 356,862 Stock compensation expense 3,748 3,306 14,160 11,755 Loss on early extinguishment of debt 2,225 6,485 Gain on sale of real estate (1,564 ) Gain on sale of land parcel (1,864 ) (46 ) Impairment of real estate 1,601 11,400 994 Impairment of land parcel 2,050 2,050 Adjusted EBITDA $ 102,219 $ 94,491 $ 393,124 $ 376,050 Total revenues $ 154,170 $ 139,249 $ 586,073 $ 548,225 Adjusted EBITDA margins 66% 68% 67% 69% 88 Table of Contents Fixed charge coverage ratio The fixed charge coverage ratio is useful to investors as a supplemental measure of the Company ability to satisfy fixed financing obligations and dividends on preferred stock. Cash interest is equal to interest expense calculated in accordance with GAAP, plus capitalized interest, less amortization of loan fees, and amortization of debt premiums/discounts. The fixed charge coverage ratio calculation below is not directly comparable to the computation of Consolidated Ratio of Earnings to Fixed Charges and Consolidated Ratio of Earnings to Combined Fixed Charges and Preferred Stock Dividends included in Exhibit 12.1 to our annual report on Form 10-K, as of December 31, 2012.

Net debt is equal to the sum of total debt less cash, cash equivalents, and restricted cash. See Adjusted EBITDA for further information on the calculation of Adjusted EBITDA. The following table summarizes the calculation of net debt to Adjusted EBITDA as of December 31, 2012 and 2011 (dollars in thousands): As of December 31, 2012 2011 Secured notes payable $ 716,144 $ 724,305 Unsecured senior notes payable 549,805 84,959 Unsecured senior line of credit 566,000 370,000 Unsecured senior bank term loans 1,350,000 1,600,000 Less: cash and cash equivalents (140,971 ) (78,539 ) Less: restricted cash (39,947 ) (23,332 ) Net debt $ 3,001,031 $ 2,677,393 Adjusted EBITDA (fourth quarter annualized) (1) $ 408,876 $ 377,964 Net debt to Adjusted EBITDA (fourth quarter annualized) (1) 7.3x 7.1x Adjusted EBITDA (trailing twelve months) $ 393,124 $ 376,050 Net debt to Adjusted EBITDA (trailing twelve months) 7.6x 7.1x (1) We believe the Adjusted EBITDA and Net debt to Adjusted EBITDA for the three months ended December 31, 2012 and 2011, annualized, reflect the completion of many development and redevelopment projects and are indicative of the Company current operating trends. Net debt to gross assets (excluding cash and restricted cash) Net debt to gross assets (excluding cash and restricted cash) is a non-GAAP financial measure that we believe is useful to investors as a supplemental measure in evaluating our leverage. Net debt is calculated as described in Net Debt to Adjusted EBITDA. Gross assets (excluding cash and restricted cash) are equal to total assets plus accumulated depreciation less cash, cash equivalents, and restricted cash. The following table summarizes the calculation of net debt to gross assets (excluding cash and restricted cash) as of December 31, 2012 and 2011 (dollars in thousands): As of December 31, 2012 2011 Net debt $ 3,001,031 $ 2,677,393 Total assets 7,150,116 6,574,129 Add: accumulated depreciation 875,035 742,535 Less: cash and cash equivalents (140,971 ) (78,539 ) Less: restricted cash (39,947 ) (23,332 ) Gross assets (excluding cash and restricted cash) $ 7,844,233 $ 7,214,793 Net debt to gross assets (excluding cash and restricted cash) 38% 37% 90 Table of Contents Net operating income See discussion of net operating income in Results of Operations.

Unencumbered net operating income as a percentage of total net operating income Unencumbered net operating income as a percentage of total net operating income is a non-GAAP financial measure that we believe is useful to investors as a performance measure of our results of operations of our unencumbered real estate assets, as it reflects primarily those income and expense items that are incurred at the unencumbered property level. We use unencumbered net operating income as a percentage of total net operating income in order to assess our compliance with our financial covenants under our debt obligations because the measure serves as a proxy for a financial measure under certain of our debt obligations. Unencumbered net operating income is derived from assets classified in continuing operations that are not subject to any mortgage, deed of trust, lien, or other security interest as of the period for which income is presented. Unencumbered net operating income for periods through September 30, 2012, has been reclassified to conform to current period presentation related to discontinued operations. See the reconciliation of net operating income to income from continuing operations in Results of Operations. The following table summarizes unencumbered net operating income as a percentage of total net operating income for the year ended December 31, 2012 and 2011 (dollars in thousands): Year Ended December 31, 2012 2011 Unencumbered net operating income $ 296,033 $ 252,376 Encumbered net operating income 115,517 136,282 Total net operating income $ 411,550 $ 388,658 Unencumbered net operating income as a percentage of total net operating income 72% 65% 91 Table of Contents
