Item 7. Management Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations. This Management Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations should be read in conjunction with our discussion of cautionary statements and significant risks to the company business under Item 1A. Risk Factors of the 2018 Form 10-K. OVERVIEW Our sales and revenues for 2018 were $54.722 billion, a 20 percent increase from 2017 sales and revenues of $45.462 billion. The increase was primarily due to higher sales volume , mostly due to improved demand across all regions and across the three primary segments. Profit per share for 2018 was $10.26, compared to profit per share of $1.26 in 2017. Profit was $6.147 billion in 2018, compared with $754 million in 2017. The increase was primarily due to lower tax expense, higher sales volume, decreased restructuring costs and improved price realization . The increase was partially offset by higher manufacturing costs and selling, general and administrative (SG&A) and research and development (R&D) expenses and lower profit from the Financial Products Segment . Fourth-quarter 2018 sales and revenues were $14.342 billion, up $1.446 billion, or 11 percent, from $12.896 billion in the fourth quarter of 2017. Fourth-quarter 2018 profit was $1.78 per share, compared with a loss of $2.18 per share in the fourth quarter of 2017. Fourth-quarter 2018 profit was $1.048 billion, compared with a loss of $1.299 billion in 2017. Highlights for 2018 include: Sales and revenues in 2018 were $54.722 billion, up 20 percent from 2017. Sales improved in all regions and across the three primary segments. Operating profit as a percent of sales and revenues was 15.2 percent in 2018, compared with 9.8 percent in 2017. Adjusted operating profit margin was 15.9 percent in 2018, compared with 12.5 percent in 2017. Profit was $10.26 per share for 2018, and excluding the items in the table below, adjusted profit per share was $11.22. For 2017 profit was $1.26 per share, and excluding the items in the table below, adjusted profit per share was $6.88. In order for our results to be more meaningful to our readers, we have separately quantified the impact of several significant items: Full Year 2018 Full Year 2017 (Millions of dollars) Profit Before Taxes Profit Per Share Profit Before Taxes Profit Per Share Profit $ 7,822 $ 10.26 $ 4,082 $ 1.26 Restructuring costs 386 0.50 1,256 1.68 Mark-to-market losses 495 0.64 301 0.26 Deferred tax valuation allowance adjustments (0.01 ) (0.18 ) U.S. tax reform impact (0.17 ) 3.95 Gain on sale of equity investment (85 ) (0.09 ) Adjusted profit $ 8,703 $ 11.22 $ 5,554 $ 6.88 Machinery, Energy & Transportation (ME&T) operating cash flow for 2018 was about $6.3 billion, more than sufficient to cover capital expenditures and dividends. ME&T operating cash flow for 2017 was about $5.5 billion. Restructuring Costs In recent years, we have incurred substantial restructuring costs to achieve a flexible and competitive cost structure. During 2018, we incurred $386 million of restructuring costs related to restructuring actions across the company. During 2017, we incurred $1.256 billion of restructuring costs with about half related to the closure of the facility in Gosselies, Belgium, and the remainder related to other restructuring actions across the company. Although we expect restructuring to continue as part of ongoing business activities, restructuring costs should be lower in 2019 than 2018.

Information on non-GAAP financial measures is included on pages 58-59. 25 Table of Contents 2018 COMPARED WITH 2017 CONSOLIDATED SALES AND REVENUES The chart above graphically illustrates reasons for the change in Consolidated Sales and Revenues between 2017 (at left) and 2018 (at right). Items favorably impacting sales and revenues appear as upward stair steps with the corresponding dollar amounts above each bar, while items negatively impacting sales and revenues appear as downward stair steps with dollar amounts reflected in parentheses above each bar. Caterpillar management utilizes these charts internally to visually communicate with the company's Board of Directors and employees. Total sales and revenues were $54.722 billion in 2018, an increase of $9.260 billion, or 20 percent, compared with $45.462 billion in 2017. The increase was primarily due to higher sales volume driven by improved demand for equipment across the three primary segments, including favorable changes in dealer inventories. Favorable price realization across the three primary segments also contributed to the sales improvement. In addition, sales were higher due to currency impacts, primarily from a stronger euro. Financial Products revenues increased slightly. Sales increased in all regions, with the largest sales increase in North America, which improved 23 percent as strong economic conditions in key end markets drove higher demand. Also contributing to higher sales was an increase in dealer inventories during 2018, compared with dealer inventories that were about flat in 2017. Sales increased 13 percent in Latin America primarily due to stabilizing economic conditions in several countries in the region that resulted in improved demand from low levels. EAME sales increased 16 percent primarily due to higher demand, including favorable changes in dealer inventories. The improvement in demand was primarily in Europe. The impact of a stronger euro and favorable price realization also contributed to higher sales. The impact of changes in dealer inventories was favorable as dealer inventories increased more significantly in 2018 than in 2017. Asia/Pacific sales increased 28 percent primarily due to higher demand in several countries across the region, including favorable changes in dealer inventories and favorable price realization. Dealer inventories increased during 2018 as compared with dealer inventories that were about flat in 2017. Dealer machine and engine inventories increased about $2.3 billion in 2018, compared with an increase of about $100 million in 2017. Dealers are independent, and the reasons for changes in their inventory levels vary, including their expectations of future demand and product delivery times. Dealers demand expectations take into account seasonal changes, macroeconomic conditions, machine rental rates and other factors. Delivery times can vary based on availability of product from Caterpillar factories and product distribution centers. 26 Table of Contents Sales and Revenues by Segment (Millions of dollars) 2017 Sales Volume Price Realization Currency Inter-Segment / Other 2018 $ Change % Change Construction Industries $ 19,240 $ 3,663 $ 122 $ 198 $ 14 $ 23,237 $ 3,997 21 % Resource Industries 7,861 2,082 316 (14 ) 25 10,270 2,409 31 % Energy & Transportation 19,382 2,637 163 68 535 22,785 3,403 18 % All Other Segments 570 (26 ) (1 ) 3 (64 ) 482 (88 ) (15 )% Corporate Items and Eliminations (4,377 ) (65 ) 1 (1 ) (510 ) (4,952 ) (575 ) Machinery, Energy & Transportation 42,676 8,291 601 254 51,822 9,146 21 % Financial Products Segment 3,093 186 3,279 186 6 % Corporate Items and Eliminations (307 ) (72 ) (379 ) (72 ) Financial Products Revenues 2,786 114 2,900 114 4 % Consolidated Sales and Revenues $ 45,462 $ 8,291 $ 601 $ 254 $ 114 $ 54,722 $ 9,260 20 % Sales and Revenues by Geographic Region North America Latin America EAME Asia/Pacific External Sales and Revenues Inter-Segment Total Sales and Revenues (Millions of dollars) $ % Chg $ % Chg $ % Chg $ % Chg $ % Chg $ % Chg $ % Chg 2018 Construction Industries $ 10,754 23% $ 1,479 6% $ 4,410 17% $ 6,473 24% $ 23,116 21% $ 121 13% $ 23,237 21% Resource Industries 3,357 30% 1,647 29% 2,217 25% 2,667 43% 9,888 32% 382 7% 10,270 31% Energy & Transportation 9,685 22% 1,331 6% 4,934 11% 2,882 25% 18,832 18% 3,953 16% 22,785 18% All Other Segments 63 (10%) 3 % 18 (67%) 70 37% 154 (13%) 328 (16%) 482 (15%) Corporate Items and Eliminations (155 ) (11 ) (2 ) (168 ) (4,784 ) (4,952 ) Machinery, Energy & Transportation 23,704 23% 4,460 13% 11,568 16% 12,090 28% 51,822 21% % 51,822 21% Financial Products Segment 2,153 7% 281 (8%) 387 (7%) 458 26% 3,279 6% % 3,279 6% Corporate Items and Eliminations (234 ) (46 ) (26 ) (73 ) (379 ) (379 ) Financial Products Revenues 1,919 6% 235 (10%) 361 (10%) 385 24% 2,900 4% % 2,900 4% Consolidated Sales and Revenues $ 25,623 22% $ 4,695 12% $ 11,929 15% $ 12,475 28% $ 54,722 20% $ % $ 54,722 20% 2017 Construction Industries $ 8,742 $ 1,396 $ 3,760 $ 5,235 $ 19,133 $ 107 $ 19,240 Resource Industries 2,582 1,281 1,775 1,866 7,504 357 7,861 Energy & Transportation 7,959 1,261 4,431 2,313 15,964 3,418 19,382 All Other Segments 70 3 54 51 178 392 570 Corporate Items and Eliminations (97 ) (1 ) (6 ) 1 (103 ) (4,274 ) (4,377 ) Machinery, Energy & Transportation 19,256 3,940 10,014 9,466 42,676 42,676 Financial Products Segment 2,006 306 418 363 3,093 3,093 Corporate Items and Eliminations (190 ) (46 ) (19 ) (52 ) (307 ) (307 ) Financial Products Revenues 1,816 260 399 311 2,786 2,786 Consolidated Sales and Revenues $ 21,072 $ 4,200 $ 10,413 $ 9,777 $ 45,462 $ $ 45,462 27 Table of Contents CONSOLIDATED OPERATING PROFIT The chart above graphically illustrates reasons for the change in Consolidated Operating Profit between 2017 (at left) and 2018 (at right). Items favorably impacting operating profit appear as upward stair steps with the corresponding dollar amounts above each bar, while items negatively impacting operating profit appear as downward stair steps with dollar amounts reflected in parentheses above each bar. Caterpillar management utilizes these charts internally to visually communicate with the company's Board of Directors and employees. The bar entitled Other includes consolidating adjustments and Machinery, Energy & Transportation other operating (income) expenses . Operating profit was $8.293 billion in 2018, an increase of $3.833 billion, or 86 percent, compared with $4.460 billion in 2017. The increase was primarily due to higher sales volume and lower restructuring costs. Higher manufacturing costs and increased SG&A/R&D expenses were mostly offset by favorable price realization. Manufacturing costs were higher due to increased material and freight costs, partially offset by lower warranty expense. Material costs were higher primarily due to increases in steel prices. The impact of recently imposed tariffs on material costs was about $110 million during 2018. We expect higher expense in 2019 due to the full-year impact of tariffs. Freight costs were unfavorable primarily due to supply chain inefficiencies as the industry responds to strong global demand. SG&A/R&D expenses increased primarily due to investments aligned with the company strategic growth initiatives. Restructuring costs were $394 million in 2018, related to restructuring actions across the company. In 2017, we incurred $1.227 billion of restructuring costs with about half related to the closure of the facility in Gosselies, Belgium, and the remainder related to other restructuring actions across the company. Short-term incentive compensation expense is directly related to financial and operational performance, measured against targets set annually. Short-term incentive compensation expense in 2018 was about $1.4 billion, nearly the same as 2017. For 2019, we expect short-term incentive compensation expense will be significantly lower than 2018. We also expect favorable price realization to about offset higher costs, excluding short-term incentive compensation expense. 28 Table of Contents Profit (Loss) by Segment (Millions of dollars) 2018 2017 $ Change % Change Construction Industries $ 4,174 $ 3,255 $ 919 28 % Resource Industries 1,603 698 905 130 % Energy & Transportation 3,938 2,856 1,082 38 % All Other Segments 23 (44 ) 67 152 % Corporate Items and Eliminations (1,583 ) (2,659 ) 1,076 Machinery, Energy & Transportation 8,155 4,106 4,049 99 % Financial Products Segment 505 792 (287 ) (36 )% Corporate Items and Eliminations 17 (116 ) 133 Financial Products 522 676 (154 ) (23 )% Consolidating Adjustments (384 ) (322 ) (62 ) Consolidated Operating Profit $ 8,293 $ 4,460 $ 3,833 86 % Other Profit/Loss Items Other income/expense in 2018 was expense of $67 million, compared with income of $153 million in 2017. The unfavorable change was primarily a result of an unfavorable impact from equity securities in Insurance Services. Effective January 1, 2018, we adopted a new U.S. GAAP accounting rule that requires our equity securities to be measured at fair value through earnings. Previously, the fair value adjustments for these securities were reported in equity until the securities were sold or an impairment was recognized. We adopted the standard using the modified retrospective approach, with no change to prior year financial statements. During 2018, we recognized a loss of $33 million related to fair value adjustments. During 2017, we recognized gains on sales of securities of $104 million. In addition, the absence of a 2017 pretax gain of $85 million on the sale of Caterpillar equity investment in IronPlanet contributed to the unfavorable change. The provision for income taxes for 2018 reflects an annual effective tax rate of 24.1 percent, compared with 27.7 percent for the full year of 2017, excluding the items discussed below. The decrease was primarily due to the reduction in the U.S. corporate tax rate beginning January 1, 2018, along with other changes in the geographic mix of profits from a tax perspective. We have completed our accounting for the income tax effects of U.S. tax reform legislation and included measurement period adjustments in 2018 of $104 million to reduce the provisionally estimated charge of $2.371 billion recognized in 2017. A $154 million benefit revised the estimated impact of the write-down of U.S. net deferred tax assets to reflect the reduction in the U.S. corporate tax rate from 35 percent to 21 percent. This benefit primarily related to the decision to make an additional discretionary pension contribution of $1.0 billion to U.S. pension plans in 2018 which was treated as deductible on the 2017 U.S. tax return. A $50 million charge revised the provisionally estimated cost of a mandatory deemed repatriation of non-U.S. earnings, including changes in the deferred tax liability related to the amount of earnings considered not indefinitely reinvested as well as the amount of unrecognized tax benefits and state tax liabilities associated with these tax positions. The provision for income taxes in 2018 and 2017 also included non-cash benefits of $63 million and $111 million, respectively, from reductions in the valuation allowance against U.S. state deferred tax assets due to improved profits in the United States. An additional benefit of $25 million was included in 2018 due to the release of a valuation allowance for a certain non-U.S. subsidiary. The provision for income taxes in 2018 also included a charge of $59 million to correct for an error which resulted in an understatement of the valuation allowance offsetting deferred tax assets for prior years. This error had the effect of overstating profit by $17 million and $33 million for 2017 and 2016, respectively. Management has concluded that the error was not material to any period presented. In addition, a tax benefit of $56 million was recorded in 2018, compared with $64 million in 2017, for the settlement of stock-based compensation awards with associated tax deductions in excess of cumulative U.S. GAAP compensation expense. We expect the annual effective tax rate will be higher in 2019. The anticipated increase primarily relates to the application of U.S. tax reform provisions to earnings of non-U.S. subsidiaries which do not have a calendar fiscal year end. Certain provisions did not apply to these subsidiaries in 2018. 29 Table of Contents Construction Industries Construction Industries total sales were $23.237 billion in 2018, compared with $19.240 billion in 2017. The increase was mostly due to higher sales volume for construction equipment. Sales were also higher due to currency impacts, primarily from a stronger euro. Sales volume increased primarily due to higher demand for construction equipment and the impact of favorable changes in dealer inventories. Dealer inventories increased significantly more during 2018 than during 2017. Sales increased in all regions. In North America, the sales increase was primarily due to higher demand for construction equipment, primarily to support oil and gas activities, including pipelines, non-residential building construction and infrastructure activities. In addition, sales increased due to the favorable impact of dealer inventories, which increased during 2018, compared with a slight decrease during 2017. We believe the strength of the U.S. economy, continued pipeline construction and state and local funding for infrastructure development will be favorable to sales in 2019. Although construction activities remained weak in Latin America, sales were higher in the region. Sales increased in EAME primarily due to higher demand and the favorable impact of currency, mostly from a stronger euro. Higher demand was driven by increased construction activities across several countries in the region. Favorable price realization also contributed to the sales increase. Sales in Asia/Pacific were higher in several countries in the region, most significantly in China, stemming from increased building construction and infrastructure investment. Favorable changes in dealer inventories contributed to the sales improvement as dealer inventories increased in 2018 and were about flat in 2017. In 2019, we expect demand in China to be about flat after two years of significant growth. Construction Industries profit was $4.174 billion in 2018, compared with $3.255 billion in 2017. The increase in profit was a result of higher sales volume and favorable price realization, partially offset by higher material and freight costs, and increased SG&A/R&D expenses, partially due to spending for strategic growth initiatives. Construction Industries profit as a percent of total sales was 18.0 percent in 2018, compared with 16.9 percent in 2017. Resource Industries Resource Industries total sales were $10.270 billion in 2018, an increase of $2.409 billion from 2017. The increase was primarily due to higher demand for both mining and heavy construction equipment, including aftermarket parts. Favorable commodity price levels and increased mining production contributed to higher mining equipment sales. In addition, increased sales to heavy construction, quarry and aggregate customers were driven by positive global economic growth. Resource Industries customers globally continue to focus on improving productivity and efficiency of existing machine assets, thereby extending equipment life cycles and lowering operating costs. Rebuild, overhaul and maintenance activity was robust, resulting in higher aftermarket parts sales. Favorable price realization also contributed to the sales improvement. In 2019, we believe commodity market fundamentals will remain supportive for investment and mining companies will increase their capital expenditures. We expect demand for heavy construction, quarry and aggregate equipment will remain strong in 2019. Resource Industries profit was $1.603 billion in 2018, compared with $698 million in 2017. The improvement was mostly due to higher sales volume and favorable price realization, partially offset by increased manufacturing costs and unfavorable currency impacts. Manufacturing costs were unfavorable as lower warranty expense was more than offset by higher freight and material costs. Resource Industries profit as a percent of total sales was 15.6 percent in 2018, compared with 8.9 percent in 2017. 30 Table of Contents Energy & Transportation Sales by Application (Millions of dollars) 2018 2017 $ Change % Change Oil and Gas $ 5,763 $ 4,424 $ 1,339 30 % Power Generation 4,334 3,551 783 22 % Industrial 3,640 3,445 195 6 % Transportation 5,095 4,544 551 12 % External Sales 18,832 15,964 2,868 18 % Inter-Segment 3,953 3,418 535 16 % Total Sales $ 22,785 $ 19,382 $ 3,403 18 % Energy & Transportation total sales were $22.785 billion in 2018, compared with $19.382 billion in 2017. The increase was primarily due to higher sales volume across all applications. Favorable price realization also contributed to the increase in sales. Oil and Gas - Sales increased due to higher demand in North America for well servicing and gas compression applications. Growth in U.S. onshore oil and gas drove increased sales for reciprocating engines and related aftermarket parts. Sales of turbines and turbine-related services were higher for production applications. Power Generation - Sales improved across all regions, with the largest increase in North America, primarily for reciprocating engine applications including data centers, and for aftermarket parts. In addition, sales increased in EAME from reciprocating engine projects, turbines and turbine-related services and favorable currency. Industrial - Sales were higher in Asia/Pacific and North America, primarily due to improving economic conditions supporting higher engine sales into industrial applications. Sales in EAME were about flat as economic uncertainty in a few countries in the Middle East was mostly offset by favorable currency impacts. Transportation - Sales were higher for rail services driven by acquisitions in Asia/Pacific and EAME and increased rail traffic in North America. Marine sales were higher in Asia/Pacific, led by increased activity in the ferry sector. Energy & Transportation profit was $3.938 billion in 2018, compared with $2.856 billion in 2017. The improvement was due to higher sales volume and favorable price realization. This was partially offset due to increased spending for strategic growth initiatives and higher freight costs. Energy & Transportation profit as a percent of total sales was 17.3 percent in 2018, compared with 14.7 percent in 2017. Financial Products Segment Financial Products segment revenues were $3.279 billion, an increase of $186 million, or 6 percent, from 2017. The increase was primarily due to higher average financing rates and higher average earning assets in North America and Asia/Pacific. These favorable impacts were partially offset by lower intercompany lending activity in North America, lower average earning assets in Latin America and lower average financing rates in Europe. Financial Products segment profit was $505 million in 2018, compared with $792 million in 2017. The decrease was primarily due to an increase in the provision for credit losses at Cat Financial, an unfavorable impact from equity securities in Insurance Services and lower intercompany lending activity. These unfavorable impacts, which are not expected to recur in 2019, were partially offset by higher average earning assets and an increase in net yield on average earning assets. At the end of 2018, past dues at Cat Financial were 3.55 percent, compared with 2.78 percent at the end of 2017. Write-offs, net of recoveries, were $189 million for 2018, compared with $114 million for 2017. As of December 31, 2018, Cat Financial's allowance for credit losses totaled $511 million, or 1.80 percent of finance receivables, compared with $365 million, or 1.33 percent of finance receivables at December 31, 2017. The increase in past dues, write-offs and allowance for credit losses was primarily due to weakening in the Cat Power Finance portfolio. Corporate Items and Eliminations Expense for corporate items and eliminations was $1.566 billion in 2018, a decrease of $1.209 billion from 2017. The decrease in expense was mostly due to lower restructuring costs and methodology differences. Restructuring costs were $394 million in 2018. In 2017, restructuring costs impacting operating profit were $1.227 billion with about half related to the closure of the facility in Gosselies, Belgium and the remainder related to other restructuring actions across the company. 31 Table of Contents FOURTH QUARTER 2018 COMPARED WITH FOURTH QUARTER 2017 CONSOLIDATED SALES AND REVENUES The chart above graphically illustrates reasons for the change in Consolidated Sales and Revenues between the fourth quarter of 2017 (at left) and the fourth quarter of 2018 (at right). Items favorably impacting sales and revenues appear as upward stair steps with the corresponding dollar amounts above each bar, while items negatively impacting sales and revenues appear as downward stair steps with dollar amounts reflected in parentheses above each bar. Caterpillar management utilizes these charts internally to visually communicate with the company's Board of Directors and employees. Total sales and revenues were $14.342 billion in the fourth quarter of 2018, an increase of $1.446 billion, or 11 percent, compared with $12.896 billion in the fourth quarter of 2017. The increase was due to higher sales volume driven by improved demand across all regions and in the three primary segments. Favorable price realization, primarily in Construction Industries, also contributed to the sales improvement. The increase was partially offset by unfavorable currency impacts due to a stronger U.S. dollar. Sales increased in all regions. The largest sales increase was in North America, which improved 13 percent as strong economic conditions in key end markets drove higher demand, including favorable changes in dealer inventories. Dealer inventories increased more significantly during the fourth quarter of 2018 than during the fourth quarter of 2017. Sales increased 11 percent in Latin America primarily due to stabilizing economic conditions in several countries in the region that resulted in improved demand from low levels. EAME sales increased 14 percent primarily due to higher demand as economic conditions improved in Europe; however, this was partially offset by economic uncertainty in a few countries in the Middle East. Asia/Pacific sales increased 7 percent mostly due to higher demand, including favorable changes in dealer inventories, in several countries across the region. This was partially offset by lower demand in China following two years of significant growth. Dealer inventories increased during the fourth quarter of 2018 and were about flat during the fourth quarter of 2017. Favorable price realization also contributed to the sales improvement. The increase in sales was partially offset by unfavorable currency impacts. Dealer machine and engine inventories increased about $200 million during the fourth quarter of 2018 and remained about flat during the fourth quarter of 2017. Dealers are independent, and the reasons for changes in their inventory levels vary, including their expectations of future demand and product delivery times. Dealers demand expectations take into account seasonal changes, macroeconomic conditions, machine rental rates and other factors.

Items favorably impacting operating profit appear as upward stair steps with the corresponding dollar amounts above each bar, while items negatively impacting operating profit appear as downward stair steps with dollar amounts reflected in parentheses above each bar. Caterpillar management utilizes these charts internally to visually communicate with the company's Board of Directors and employees. The bar entitled Other includes consolidating adjustments and Machinery, Energy & Transportation other operating (income) expenses. Operating profit for the fourth quarter of 2018 was $1.883 billion, compared with $1.387 billion in the fourth quarter of 2017. The increase of $496 million was mostly due to higher sales volume. Favorable price realization and lower restructuring costs were mostly offset by higher manufacturing costs and lower profit from Financial Products. Manufacturing costs were higher due to increased material and freight costs, partially offset by lower warranty expense. Material costs were higher primarily due to increases in steel prices and tariffs. Freight costs were unfavorable primarily due to continued supply chain inefficiencies. Financial Products operating profit was lower primarily due to an increase in the provision for credit losses, which was mostly driven by a $72 million unfavorable impact from an increase in allowance rate and an increase in write-offs of $13 million, due to continued weakening in the Cat Power Finance portfolio. This was partially offset by higher average earning assets. Restructuring costs were $101 million in the fourth quarter of 2018, compared with $245 million in the fourth quarter of 2017. Short-term incentive compensation expense was about $310 million in the fourth quarter of 2018, compared with about $350 million in the fourth quarter of 2017. Operating profit margin for the fourth quarter of 2018 was 13.1 percent, compared with 10.8 percent in the fourth quarter of 2017.

Other income/expense in the fourth quarter of 2018 was a loss of $417 million, compared with a loss of $107 million in the fourth quarter of 2017. The unfavorable change was primarily a result of an increase in mark-to-market losses related to pension and other postemployment benefit (OPEB) plans and an unfavorable impact from equity securities. The provision for income taxes in the fourth quarter of 2018 reflects an annual effective tax rate of 24.1 percent, compared with 27.7 percent for the full year of 2017, excluding the items discussed below. The decrease was primarily due to the reduction in the U.S. corporate tax rate beginning January 1, 2018, along with other changes in the geographic mix of profits from a tax perspective. The provision for income taxes in the fourth quarter of 2018 and 2017 also included non-cash benefits of $63 million and $111 million, respectively, from reductions in the valuation allowance against U.S. state deferred tax assets due to improved profits in the United States. The provision for income taxes in the fourth quarter of 2018 also included a $50 million increase related to the $2.371 billion charge recorded in the fourth quarter of 2017 due to the enactment of U.S. tax reform legislation. In addition, a tax benefit of $4 million was recorded in the fourth quarter of 2018, compared with $19 million in the fourth quarter of 2017, for the settlement of stock-based compensation awards with associated tax deductions in excess of cumulative U.S. GAAP compensation expense. The provision for income taxes in the fourth quarter of 2018 and 2017 also included a $8 million charge and a $130 million benefit, respectively, related to the change from the third-quarter estimated annual tax rate. Construction Industries Construction Industries total sales were $5.705 billion in the fourth quarter of 2018, compared with $5.295 billion in the fourth quarter of 2017. The increase was mostly due to higher sales volume for construction equipment. Favorable price realization was mostly offset by unfavorable currency impacts due to a stronger U.S. dollar. In North America, the sales increase was driven by higher demand for new equipment, with about half due to an increase in dealer inventories. The increase in demand was primarily to support oil and gas activities, including pipelines, and non-residential building construction activities. Favorable price realization also contributed to the sales improvement. Construction activities remained at low levels in Latin America. Sales increased in EAME as infrastructure, road and non-residential building construction activities drove higher demand in Europe, partially offset by weakness in the Middle East. Sales in Asia/Pacific declined due to lower demand in China, partially offset by higher demand in a few other countries in the region. Unfavorable currency impacts also contributed to the sales decline. Construction Industries profit was $845 million in the fourth quarter of 2018, compared with $837 million in the fourth quarter of 2017. The increase in profit was a result of favorable price realization and higher sales volume, mostly offset by higher manufacturing costs, including material, freight, labor costs and the absence of Brazil incentives. Construction Industries profit as a percent of total sales was 14.8 percent in the fourth quarter of 2018, compared with 15.8 percent in the fourth quarter of 2017. Resource Industries Resource Industries total sales were $2.797 billion in the fourth quarter of 2018, an increase of $489 million from the fourth quarter of 2017. The increase was primarily due to higher demand for both mining and heavy construction equipment, including quarry and aggregate. Mining activities were robust as commodity market fundamentals remained positive, and increased non-residential construction activities drove higher sales. Resource Industries profit was $400 million in the fourth quarter of 2018, compared with $210 million in the fourth quarter of 2017. The improvement was mostly due to higher sales volume and favorable price realization, partially offset by higher material and freight costs. Resource Industries profit as a percent of total sales was 14.3 percent in the fourth quarter of 2018, compared with 9.1 percent in the fourth quarter of 2017. 35 Table of Contents Energy & Transportation Sales by Application (Millions of dollars) Fourth Quarter 2018 Fourth Quarter 2017 $ Change % Change Oil and Gas $ 1,719 $ 1,497 $ 222 15 % Power Generation 1,271 1,060 211 20 % Industrial 902 899 3 % Transportation 1,373 1,250 123 10 % External Sales 5,265 4,706 559 12 % Inter-Segment 1,022 934 88 9 % Total Sales $ 6,287 $ 5,640 $ 647 11 % Energy & Transportation total sales were $6.287 billion in the fourth quarter of 2018, compared with $5.640 billion in the fourth quarter of 2017. The increase was primarily due to higher sales volume across all applications except Industrial, which was flat. Oil and Gas - Sales increased due to higher demand for reciprocating engines in North America for gas compression and well servicing applications. Sales of turbines and turbine-related services were about flat. Power Generation - Sales improved across all regions, with the largest increases in North America and EAME primarily for reciprocating engine applications, including data centers and other large power generation projects. Industrial - Sales were flat, with increases in Asia/Pacific and North America about offset by lower sales in EAME and Latin America. Transportation - Sales were higher primarily due to rail services, driven by acquisitions. Energy & Transportation profit was $1.079 billion in the fourth quarter of 2018, compared with $874 million in the fourth quarter of 2017. The improvement was mostly due to higher sales volume. The increase was partially offset by higher manufacturing costs, including freight costs. Energy & Transportation profit as a percent of total sales was 17.2 percent in the fourth quarter of 2018, compared with 15.5 percent in the fourth quarter of 2017. Financial Products Segment Financial Products segment revenues were $812 million in the fourth quarter of 2018, an increase of $29 million, or 4 percent, from the fourth quarter of 2017. The increase was primarily due to higher average financing rates and higher average earning assets in North America and Asia/Pacific. These favorable impacts were partially offset by an unfavorable impact from returned or repossessed equipment in Europe and Latin America. Financial Products segment profit was $29 million in the fourth quarter of 2018, compared with $233 million in the fourth quarter of 2017. About half of the decrease was due to an unfavorable impact from equity securities in Insurance Services, which was driven by the absence of investment gains from the fourth quarter of 2017 and an unfavorable impact from mark-to-market in the fourth quarter of 2018. In addition, an increase in the provision for credit losses at Cat Financial also contributed to lower profit. This increase was driven by a higher allowance rate and an increase in write-offs, due to continued weakening in the Cat Power Finance portfolio. Corporate Items and Eliminations Expense for corporate items and eliminations was $321 million in the fourth quarter of 2018, a decrease of $344 million from the fourth quarter of 2017, primarily due to methodology differences and lower restructuring costs. Restructuring costs were $101 million in the fourth quarter of 2018, compared with $245 million in the fourth quarter of 2017. 36 Table of Contents 2017 COMPARED WITH 2016 CONSOLIDATED SALES AND REVENUES The chart above graphically illustrates reasons for the change in Consolidated Sales and Revenues between 2016 (at left) and 2017 (at right). Items favorably impacting sales and revenues appear as upward stair steps with the corresponding dollar amounts above each bar, while items negatively impacting sales and revenues appear as downward stair steps with dollar amounts reflected in parentheses above each bar. Caterpillar management utilizes these charts internally to visually communicate with the company's board of directors and employees. Total sales and revenues were $45.462 billion in 2017, an increase of $6.925 billion, or 18 percent, compared with $38.537 billion in 2016. The increase was primarily due to higher sales volume, mostly due to improved end-user demand. In addition, favorable changes in dealer inventories contributed to increased sales volume. The improvement in end-user demand was across all regions and most end markets. The favorable change in dealer inventories was primarily due to a decrease in 2016, compared with dealer inventories that were about flat in 2017. Dealer machine and engine inventories increased about $100 million in 2017, compared with a decrease of about $1.6 billion during 2016. Dealers are independent, and the reasons for changes in their inventory levels vary, including their expectations of future demand and product delivery times. Dealers demand expectations take into account seasonal changes, macroeconomic conditions, machine rental rates and other factors. Delivery times can vary based on availability of product from Caterpillar factories and product distribution centers. By segment, the largest sales volume increase was in Construction Industries mostly due to higher end-user demand for construction equipment. Resource Industries sales volume increased due to higher end-user demand for aftermarket parts and equipment and a favorable impact of changes in dealer inventories. Energy & Transportation sales volume was higher mostly due to increased demand for equipment and aftermarket parts for oil and gas and industrial applications. Favorable price realization, mostly in Construction Industries, also contributed to the sales improvement. Financial Products revenues were about flat. Sales increased in all regions. In North America, sales increased 19 percent primarily due to higher end-user demand mostly for on-shore oil and gas applications and construction equipment, the favorable impact of changes in dealer inventories and favorable price realization, primarily in Construction Industries. Asia/Pacific sales increased 23 percent primarily due to an increase in construction equipment sales, mostly in China resulting from increased building construction and infrastructure investment. EAME sales increased 16 percent primarily due to higher end-user demand for equipment and aftermarket parts in Resource Industries and favorable changes in dealer inventories, as dealers decreased inventories in 2016 and inventories were about flat in 2017. In addition, price realization was favorable, primarily in Construction Industries. Sales increased 25 percent in Latin America primarily due to stabilizing economic conditions in several countries in the region that resulted in improved end-user demand from low levels and the favorable impact of changes in dealer inventories as inventories decreased in 2016 and increased in 2017. 37 Table of Contents Sales and Revenues by Segment (Millions of dollars) 2016 Sales Volume Price Realization Currency Inter-Segment / Other 2017 $ Change % Change Construction Industries $ 15,690 $ 2,810 $ 751 $ (40 ) $ 29 $ 19,240 $ 3,550 23 % Resource Industries 6,010 1,638 118 22 73 7,861 1,851 31 % Energy & Transportation 16,951 1,556 (42 ) 39 878 19,382 2,431 14 % All Other Segments 544 39 (13 ) 570 26 5 % Corporate Items and Eliminations (3,422 ) 12 (967 ) (4,377 ) (955 ) Machinery, Energy & Transportation 35,773 6,055 827 21 42,676 6,903 19 % Financial Products Segment 2,993 100 3,093 100 3 % Corporate Items and Eliminations (229 ) (78 ) (307 ) (78 ) Financial Products Revenues 2,764 22 2,786 22 1 % Consolidated Sales and Revenues $ 38,537 $ 6,055 $ 827 $ 21 $ 22 $ 45,462 $ 6,925 18 % Sales and Revenues by Geographic Region North America Latin America EAME Asia/Pacific External Sales and Revenues Inter-Segment Total Sales and Revenues (Millions of dollars) $ % Chg $ % Chg $ % Chg $ % Chg $ % Chg $ % Chg $ % Chg 2017 Construction Industries $ 8,742 16% $ 1,396 32% $ 3,760 15% $ 5,235 39% $ 19,133 23% $ 107 37% $ 19,240 23% Resource Industries 2,582 25% 1,281 28% 1,775 51% 1,866 26% 7,504 31% 357 26% 7,861 31% Energy & Transportation 7,959 19% 1,261 14% 4,431 5% 2,313 (5%) 15,964 11% 3,418 35% 19,382 14% All Other Segments 70 52% 3 % 54 93% 51 (18%) 178 28% 392 (3%) 570 5% Corporate Items and Eliminations (97 ) (1 ) (6 ) 1 (103 ) (4,274 ) (4,377 ) Machinery, Energy & Transportation 19,256 19% 3,940 25% 10,014 16% 9,466 23% 42,676 19% % 42,676 19% Financial Products Segment 2,006 8% 306 (9%) 418 4% 363 (8%) 3,093 3% % 3,093 3% Corporate Items and Eliminations (190 ) (46 ) (19 ) (52 ) (307 ) (307 ) Financial Products Revenues 1,816 5% 260 (11%) 399 4% 311 (12%) 2,786 1% % 2,786 1% Consolidated Sales and Revenues $ 21,072 17% $ 4,200 22% $ 10,413 15% $ 9,777 21% $ 45,462 18% $ % $ 45,462 18% 2016 Construction Industries $ 7,529 $ 1,059 $ 3,270 $ 3,754 $ 15,612 $ 78 $ 15,690 Resource Industries 2,068 1,001 1,179 1,478 5,726 284 6,010 Energy & Transportation 6,680 1,104 4,201 2,426 14,411 2,540 16,951 All Other Segments 46 3 28 62 139 405 544 Corporate Items and Eliminations (98 ) (3 ) (9 ) (5 ) (115 ) (3,307 ) (3,422 ) Machinery, Energy & Transportation 16,225 3,164 8,669 7,715 35,773 35,773 Financial Products Segment 1,862 336 401 394 2,993 2,993 Corporate Items and Eliminations (125 ) (45 ) (17 ) (42 ) (229 ) (229 ) Financial Products Revenues 1,737 291 384 352 2,764 2,764 Consolidated Sales and Revenues $ 17,962 $ 3,455 $ 9,053 $ 8,067 $ 38,537 $ $ 38,537 38 Table of Contents CONSOLIDATED OPERATING PROFIT The chart above graphically illustrates reasons for the change in Consolidated Operating Profit between 2016 (at left) and 2017 (at right). Items favorably impacting operating profit appear as upward stair steps with the corresponding dollar amounts above each bar, while items negatively impacting operating profit appear as downward stair steps with dollar amounts reflected in parentheses above each bar. Caterpillar management utilizes these charts internally to visually communicate with the company's Board of Directors and employees. The bar entitled Other includes consolidating adjustments and Machinery, Energy & Transportation other operating (income) expenses. Operating profit for 2017 was $4.460 billion, compared with $1.162 billion in 2016. The increase of $3.298 billion was primarily due to higher sales volume, improved price realization and the absence of a goodwill impairment charge in Resource Industries in 2016. An increase in SG&A/R&D expenses and restructuring costs was partially offset by lower manufacturing costs. SG&A/R&D expenses increased primarily due to higher short-term incentive compensation expense, partially offset by the favorable impact of restructuring and cost reduction actions. These actions primarily impacted research and development (R&D) expenses. Short-term incentive compensation expense is directly related to financial and operational performance, measured against targets set annually. Short-term incentive compensation expense was about $1.4 billion in 2017, significantly above targeted levels, compared with about $250 million in 2016. In 2017, we incurred $1.227 billion of restructuring costs with about half related to the closure of the facility in Gosselies, Belgium, and the remainder related to other restructuring actions across the company. In 2016, restructuring costs were $1.012 billion, primarily related to Resource Industries and Energy & Transportation. Manufacturing costs were lower primarily due to the favorable impact from cost absorption and efficiencies, partially offset by higher short-term incentive compensation expense. Cost absorption was favorable as inventory increased in 2017, and decreased in 2016. Material costs were slightly unfavorable in 2017, as higher steel costs were partially offset by cost reduction actions. 39 Table of Contents Profit (Loss) by Segment (Millions of dollars) 2017 2016 $ Change % Change Construction Industries $ 3,255 $ 1,639 $ 1,616 99 % Resource Industries 698 (1,045 ) 1,743 n/a Energy & Transportation 2,856 2,187 669 31 % All Other Segments (44 ) (85 ) 41 48 % Corporate Items and Eliminations (2,659 ) (1,943 ) (716 ) Machinery, Energy & Transportation 4,106 753 3,353 445 % Financial Products Segment 792 702 90 13 % Corporate Items and Eliminations (116 ) (53 ) (63 ) Financial Products 676 649 27 4 % Consolidating Adjustments (322 ) (240 ) (82 ) Consolidated Operating Profit $ 4,460 $ 1,162 $ 3,298 284 % Other Profit/Loss Items Other income/expense in 2017 was income of $153 million, compared with a loss of $518 million in 2016. The improvement was primarily due to a decrease in mark-to-market losses related to pension and OPEB plans, a pretax gain on the sale of Caterpillar's equity investment in IronPlanet, gains on sale of securities and an increase in interest income. The favorable change was partially offset by an unfavorable net impact from currency translation and hedging gains and losses. Currency translation and hedging net losses in 2017 were significantly higher than the net losses in 2016. The provision for income taxes for 2017 reflects an annual effective tax rate of 27.7 percent, compared with 36.4 percent for the full-year 2016, excluding the items discussed below. The effective tax rate related to 2017 full-year adjusted profit before tax, excluding a discrete benefit from stock-based compensation awards, was 27 percent, compared with 26 percent in 2016. The provision for income taxes for 2017 also included a charge of $2.371 billion due to the enactment of U.S. tax reform legislation on December 22, 2017. The provisionally estimated charge included a $596 million write-down of net deferred tax assets to reflect the reduction in the U.S. corporate tax rate from 35 percent to 21 percent beginning January 1, 2018, with the remainder primarily related to the cost of a mandatory deemed repatriation of non-U.S. earnings. The 2017 provision for income taxes also included the following: A non-cash benefit of $111 million, net of U.S. federal tax at 35 percent, from reductions in the valuation allowance against U.S. state deferred tax assets due to improved profits in the United States. A tax benefit of $64 million for the settlement of stock-based compensation awards with associated tax deductions in excess of cumulative U.S. GAAP compensation expense. A charge of $15 million for an increase in prior year taxes related to the Gosselies, Belgium, facility restructuring costs. The provision for income taxes for 2016 also included a non-cash charge of $141 million, net of U.S. federal tax at 35 percent, for increases in the valuation allowance against U.S. state deferred tax assets. Construction Industries Construction Industries total sales were $19.240 billion in 2017, compared with $15.690 billion in 2016. The increase was due to higher sales volume and favorable price realization. Sales volume increased due to higher end-user demand, primarily for equipment in Asia/Pacific and North America. In addition, sales volume increased due to favorable changes in dealer inventories, as inventories decreased in 2016 and increased in 2017. Although market conditions remained competitive, price realization was favorable due to a particularly weak pricing environment in 2016, and previously implemented price increases impacting 2017. Sales increased across all regions with the largest increases in Asia/Pacific and North America. 40 Table of Contents Sales in Asia/Pacific were higher as a result of an increase in end-user demand, primarily in China, stemming from increased building construction and infrastructure investment. In North America, sales increased primarily due to higher end-user demand for construction equipment, mostly due to improved oil and gas, residential and nonresidential construction activities. Also contributing to higher sales was the impact of favorable changes in dealer inventories, as inventories decreased more in 2016 than in 2017, and favorable price realization. Sales in EAME increased due to favorable changes in dealer inventories and favorable price realization. The favorable impact of change in dealer inventories resulted from a decrease in 2016 and an increase in 2017. Although construction activity remained weak in Latin America, sales were higher as end-user demand increased from low levels due to stabilizing economic conditions in several countries in the region. In addition, sales volume increased due to favorable changes in dealer inventories, as dealer inventories increased in 2017 and decreased in 2016. Construction Industries profit was $3.255 billion in 2017, compared with $1.639 billion in 2016. The increase in profit was primarily due to higher sales volume and favorable price realization. SG&A/R&D expenses were unfavorable primarily due to higher short-term incentive compensation expense. Construction Industries profit as a percent of total sales was 16.9 percent in 2017, compared with 10.4 percent in 2016. Resource Industries Resource Industries total sales were $7.861 billion in 2017, an increase of $1.851 billion, or 31 percent, from 2016. Sales increased due to higher end-user demand for aftermarket parts and equipment and the favorable impact of changes in dealer inventories. Positive commodity price trends in 2017 drove improved market conditions and better financial health of mining companies. After a number of years of low investment, miners began to increase capital expenditures in 2017, reflecting more confidence in their end markets. Idle mining trucks on customer sites also decreased in 2017. These changes resulted in higher sales for aftermarket parts to support increased mining activity as well as maintenance and rebuild activities and, by the second half of 2017, resulted in higher end-user demand for mining equipment. Dealer inventories increased in 2017, compared with a significant decrease in 2016. Resource Industries profit was $698 million in 2017, compared with a loss of $1.045 billion in 2016. The improvement was partially due to the absence of a goodwill impairment charge of $595 million in 2016. Higher sales volume, lower manufacturing costs and favorable price realization also contributed to increased profit. Manufacturing costs were lower primarily due to a favorable impact from cost absorption, lower period manufacturing costs and efficiencies. Cost absorption was favorable as inventory increased in 2017, to support higher production volumes and decreased in 2016. Period manufacturing costs were lower primarily due to the favorable impact of restructuring and cost reduction actions, partially offset by an increase in short-term incentive compensation expense. Resource Industries profit as a percent of total sales was 8.9 percent in 2017, compared with a loss as a percent of total sales of 17.4 percent in 2016. Energy & Transportation Energy & Transportation total sales were $19.382 billion in 2017, compared with $16.951 billion in 2016. The increase was primarily due to higher sales in oil and gas and industrial applications. Oil and Gas - Sales increased in North America due to higher sales of reciprocating engines and aftermarket parts used in on-shore gas compression and well servicing applications. Sales in remaining regions were about flat. Industrial - Sales were higher in all regions, reflecting increased sales for equipment across end-user applications and aftermarket parts. Transportation - Sales were higher primarily in North America for rail services driven by increased rail traffic. Power Generation - Sales were about flat in all regions as the industry remains challenged. Energy & Transportation profit was $2.856 billion in 2017, compared with $2.187 billion in 2016. The increase was primarily due to higher sales volume, partially offset by higher SG&A/R&D expenses and manufacturing costs. The increase in SG&A/R&D expenses was primarily due to higher short-term incentive compensation expense. Manufacturing costs were higher primarily due to higher short-term incentive compensation expense, partially offset by favorable impact from cost absorption and improved material costs. Cost absorption was favorable as inventory increased in 2017, compared with a decrease in 2016. Energy & Transportation profit as a percent of total sales was 14.7 percent in 2017, compared with 12.9 percent in 2016. 41 Table of Contents Financial Products Segment Financial Products segment revenues were $3.093 billion, an increase of $100 million, or 3 percent, from 2016. The increase was primarily due to higher average financing rates in North America, a favorable impact from intercompany lending activity in North America and higher average earning assets in EAME. These favorable impacts were partially offset by lower average financing rates in Asia/Pacific and lower average earning assets in North America and Latin America. Financial Products segment profit was $792 million in 2017, compared with $702 million in 2016. The increase was primarily due to higher gains on sales of securities at Insurance Services, an increase in net yield on average earning assets and increased intercompany lending activity. These favorable impacts were partially offset by an increase in SG&A expenses due to higher short-term incentive compensation expense. At the end of 2017, past dues at Cat Financial were 2.78 percent, compared with 2.38 percent at the end of 2016. Write-offs, net of recoveries, were $114 million for the full year of 2017, compared with $123 million for the full year of 2016. As of December 31, 2017, Cat Financial's allowance for credit losses totaled $365 million, or 1.33 percent of finance receivables, compared with $343 million, or 1.29 percent of finance receivables at year-end 2016. Corporate Items and Eliminations Expense for corporate items and eliminations was $2.775 billion in 2017, which was an increase of $779 million compared with 2016. The increase in expense was a result of higher restructuring costs, methodology differences, timing differences and an increase in short-term incentive compensation expense. RESTRUCTURING COSTS Restructuring costs for 2018, 2017 and 2016 were as follows: (Millions of dollars) 2018 2017 2016 Employee separations 1 $ 112 $ 525 $ 297 Contract terminations 1 7 183 62 Long-lived asset impairments 1 93 346 391 Defined benefit plan curtailments and termination benefits 2 (8 ) 29 7 Other 3 182 173 262 Total restructuring costs $ 386 $ 1,256 $ 1,019 1 Recognized in Other operating (income) expenses. 2 Recognized in Other income (expense). 3 Represents costs related to our restructuring programs, primarily for accelerated depreciation, project management costs, equipment relocation and inventory write-downs, and also LIFO inventory decrement benefits from inventory liquidations at closed facilities, all of which are primarily included in Cost of goods sold. The restructuring costs in 2018 were primarily related to ongoing facility closures across the company. In 2017, about half of the restructuring costs were related to the closure of the facility in Gosselies, Belgium, within Construction Industries, and the remainder was related to other restructuring actions across the company. The restructuring costs in 2016 were primarily related to actions in Resource Industries in response to continued weakness in the mining industry. In addition, costs in 2016 resulted from our decision to discontinue production of on-highway vocational trucks within Energy & Transportation and other restructuring actions across the company. Restructuring costs are a reconciling item between Segment profit and Consolidated profit before taxes. 42 Table of Contents The following table summarizes the 2017 and 2018 employee separation activity: (Millions of dollars) Liability balance at December 31, 2016 $ 147 Increase in liability (separation charges) 525 Reduction in liability (payments) (423 ) Liability balance at December 31, 2017 $ 249 Increase in liability (separation charges) 112 Reduction in liability (payments) (276 ) Liability balance at December 31, 2018 $ 85 Most of the remaining liability balance as of December 31, 2018 is expected to be paid in 2019. In March 2017, Caterpillar informed Belgian authorities of the decision to proceed to a collective dismissal, which led to the closure of the Gosselies site, impacting about 2,000 employees. Production of Caterpillar products at the Gosselies site ended during the second quarter of 2017. The other operations and functions at the Gosselies site were phased out by the end of the second quarter of 2018. The program concluded in 2018, and we incurred a total of $647 million of restructuring costs (primarily in 2017) under this program. These costs were primarily related to employee separation costs, long-lived asset impairments and other costs which were partially offset by a LIFO inventory decrement benefit. Restructuring costs for the year ended December 31, 2016 were $1,019 million. Throughout 2016, we initiated the following restructuring plans: In February 2016, we made the decision to discontinue production of on-highway vocational trucks. Based on the business climate in the truck industry and a thorough evaluation of the business, the company decided it would withdraw from this market. We recognized $104 million of restructuring costs, primarily related to long-lived asset impairments and sales discounts. In the second half of 2016, we took additional restructuring actions in Resource Industries, including ending the production of track drills; pursuing strategic alternatives related to room and pillar products; consolidation of two product development divisions; and additional actions in response to ongoing weakness in the mining industry. For the year ended December 31, 2016, we incurred $369 million of restructuring costs for these plans primarily related to long-lived asset impairments, employee separation costs and inventory write-downs. In September 2015, we announced a large scale restructuring plan (the Plan) including a voluntary retirement enhancement program for qualifying U.S. employees, several voluntary separation programs outside of the U.S., additional involuntary programs throughout the company and manufacturing facility consolidations and closures that occurred through 2018. The largest action among those included in the Plan was related to our European manufacturing footprint which led to the Gosselies, Belgium, facility closure as discussed above. We incurred $121 million, $817 million and $281 million of restructuring costs associated with these actions in 2018, 2017 and 2016, respectively. Total restructuring costs incurred since the inception of the Plan were $1,788 million. The remaining costs of approximately $50 million related to the Plan are expected to be recognized in 2019. Although we expect restructuring to continue as part of ongoing business activities, restructuring costs are anticipated to be lower in 2019 than 2018. We are expecting about $300 million of cost reduction in 2019 from lower operating costs, primarily SG&A expenses and Cost of goods sold primarily resulting from 2018 restructuring actions.

LIQUIDITY AND CAPITAL RESOURCES Sources of funds We generate significant capital resources from operating activities, which are the primary source of funding for our ME&T operations. Funding for these businesses is also available from commercial paper and long-term debt issuances. Financial Products' operations are funded primarily from commercial paper, term debt issuances and collections from its existing portfolio. During 2018, we experienced favorable liquidity conditions globally in both our ME&T and Financial Products' operations. On a consolidated basis, we ended 2018 with $7.86 billion of cash, a decrease of $404 million from year-end 2017. We intend to maintain a strong cash and liquidity position. 45 Table of Contents Our cash balances are held in numerous locations throughout the world with approximately $6.9 billion held by our non-U.S. subsidiaries. As a result of U.S. tax reform legislation enacted in December 2017, we expect to be able to use cash held by non-U.S. subsidiaries in the United States in the future with minimal tax consequences. Consolidated operating cash flow for 2018 was $6.56 billion, up from $5.71 billion in 2017. The increase was due to higher profit in 2018 adjusted for non-cash items. Profit in 2017 included a non-cash charge related to U.S. tax reform legislation enacted in December 2017. The most significant driver of higher profit was an increase in sales volume in 2018. This improvement was mostly offset by higher working capital requirements to support increasing production volumes and higher short-term incentive compensation payments. See further discussion of operating cash flow under ME&T and Financial Products. Total debt as of December 31, 2018 was $36.55 billion, an increase of $1.68 billion from year-end 2017. Debt related to Financial Products increased $1.60 billion, primarily due to increased portfolio funding requirements. Debt related to ME&T increased $79 million in 2018. During 2018, we repurchased $3.80 billion of Caterpillar common stock. We have three global credit facilities with a syndicate of banks totaling $10.50 billion (Credit Facility) available in the aggregate to both Caterpillar and Cat Financial for general liquidity purposes. Based on management's allocation decision, which can be revised from time to time, the portion of the Credit Facility available to ME&T as of December 31, 2018 was $2.75 billion. Information on our Credit Facility is as follows: The 364-day facility of $3.15 billion (of which $0.82 billion is available to ME&T) expires in September 2019. The three-year facility, as amended in September 2018, of $2.73 billion (of which $0.72 billion is available to ME&T) expires in September 2021. The five-year facility, as amended in September 2018, of $4.62 billion (of which $1.21 billion is available to ME&T) expires in September 2023. At December 31, 2018, Caterpillar's consolidated net worth was $14.07 billion, which was above the $9.00 billion required under the Credit Facility. The consolidated net worth is defined as the consolidated shareholder's equity including preferred stock but excluding the pension and other postretirement benefits balance within Accumulated other comprehensive income (loss). At December 31, 2018, Cat Financial's covenant interest coverage ratio was 1.56 to 1. This is above the 1.15 to 1 minimum ratio, calculated as (1) profit excluding income taxes, interest expense and net gain/(loss) from interest rate derivatives to (2) interest expense calculated at the end of each calendar quarter for the rolling four quarter period then most recently ended, required by the Credit Facility. In addition, at December 31, 2018, Cat Financial's six-month covenant leverage ratio was 7.69 to 1 and year-end covenant leverage ratio was 8.33 to 1. This is below the maximum ratio of debt to net worth of 10 to 1, calculated (1) on a monthly basis as the average of the leverage ratios determined on the last day of each of the six preceding calendar months and (2) at each December 31, required by the Credit Facility. In the event Caterpillar or Cat Financial does not meet one or more of their respective financial covenants under the Credit Facility in the future (and are unable to obtain a consent or waiver), the syndicate of banks may terminate the commitments allocated to the party that does not meet its covenants. Additionally, in such event, certain of Cat Financial's other lenders under other loan agreements where similar financial covenants or cross default provisions are applicable, may, at their election, choose to pursue remedies under those loan agreements, including accelerating the repayment of outstanding borrowings. At December 31, 2018, there were no borrowings under the Credit Facility. 46 Table of Contents Our total credit commitments and available credit as of December 31, 2018 were: December 31, 2018 (Millions of dollars) Consolidated Machinery, Energy & Transportation Financial Products Credit lines available: Global credit facilities $ 10,500 $ 2,750 $ 7,750 Other external 4,577 4,577 Total credit lines available 15,077 2,750 12,327 Less: Commercial paper outstanding (4,759 ) (4,759 ) Less: Utilized credit (1,172 ) (1,172 ) Available credit $ 9,146 $ 2,750 $ 6,396 The other consolidated credit lines with banks as of December 31, 2018 totaled $4.58 billion. These committed and uncommitted credit lines, which may be eligible for renewal at various future dates or have no specified expiration date, are used primarily by our subsidiaries for local funding requirements. Caterpillar or Cat Financial may guarantee subsidiary borrowings under these lines. We receive debt ratings from the major credit rating agencies. Moody rates our debt as low-A , while Fitch and S&P maintain a mid-A debt rating. This split rating has not had a material impact on our borrowing costs or our overall financial health. However, a downgrade of our credit ratings by any of the major credit rating agencies would result in increased borrowing costs and could make access to certain credit markets more difficult. In the event economic conditions deteriorate such that access to debt markets becomes unavailable, ME&T's operations would rely on cash flow from operations, use of existing cash balances, borrowings from Cat Financial and access to our Credit Facility. Our Financial Products' operations would rely on cash flow from its existing portfolio, existing cash balances, access to our Credit Facility and other credit line facilities of Cat Financial and potential borrowings from Caterpillar. In addition, we maintain a support agreement with Cat Financial, which requires Caterpillar to remain the sole owner of Cat Financial and may, under certain circumstances, require Caterpillar to make payments to Cat Financial should Cat Financial fail to maintain certain financial ratios. Machinery, Energy & Transportation Net cash provided by operating activities was $6.35 billion in 2018, compared with $5.46 billion in 2017. The increase was primarily due to higher profit in 2018 adjusted for non-cash items. Profit in 2017 included a non-cash charge related to U.S. tax reform legislation enacted in December 2017. The most significant driver of higher profit was an increase in sales volume during 2018. This improvement was mostly offset by higher working capital requirements to support increasing production volumes and higher short-term incentive compensation payments. Within working capital, changes to accounts payable, inventories and customer advances unfavorably impacted cash flow, but were partially offset by changes to accounts receivable. Net cash used for investing activities in 2018 was $1.19 billion, compared with net cash used of $727 million in 2017. The change was primarily due to the acquisition of ECM S.p.A. and Downer Freight Rail in 2018 and increased capital expenditures. Net cash used for financing activities during 2018 was $5.47 billion, compared with net cash used of $2.58 billion in 2017. The change was primarily due to the repurchase of $3.80 billion of Caterpillar common stock in 2018, partially offset by lower payments on debt in 2018, as 2017 included the early retirement of $900 million of debt due in December 2018 and a long-term debt maturity of $500 million. Our priorities for cash deployment have not changed. While our short-term priorities for the use of cash may vary from time to time as business needs and conditions dictate, our long-term cash deployment strategy is focused on the following priorities. Our top priority is to maintain a strong financial position in support of a Mid-A rating. Next, we intend to fund operational requirements and commitments. Then, we intend to fund priorities that profitably grow the company and return capital to shareholders through dividend growth and share repurchases. Additional information on cash deployment is as follows: Strong financial position Our top priority is to maintain a strong financial position in support of a Mid-A rating. We track a diverse group of financial metrics that focus on liquidity, leverage, cash flow and margins aligned with our cash deployment actions and the various methodologies used by the major credit rating agencies. 47 Table of Contents Operational excellence and commitments Capital expenditures were $1.22 billion during 2018, compared to $916 million in 2017. We expect ME&T's capital expenditures in 2019 to be about $1.4 billion. Contributions to our pension and OPEB plans were $1.35 billion and $1.61 billion in 2018 and 2017, respectively. Both years included a $1.0 billion discretionary contribution to our U.S. pension plans. We expect to make approximately $315 million of contributions to our pension and OPEB plans in 2019. Fund strategic growth initiatives and return capital to shareholders We intend to fund initiatives that drive long-term profitable growth that will be focused in the areas of expanded offerings and services, including acquisitions. In 2018, we acquired ECM S.p.A. and Downer Freight Rail. Each quarter, our Board of Directors reviews the company's dividend for the applicable quarter. The Board evaluates the financial condition of the company and considers the economic outlook, corporate cash flow, the company's liquidity needs, and the health and stability of global credit markets to determine whether to maintain or change the quarterly dividend. Dividends paid totaled $1.95 billion in 2018, representing 78 cents per share paid in the first and second quarter, and 86 cents per share paid in the third quarter and fourth quarter. In January 2014, the Board of Directors approved an authorization to repurchase up to $10 billion of Caterpillar common stock (the 2014 Authorization), which expired on December 31, 2018. As of January 1, 2018, $5.47 billion remained available under the 2014 Authorization, and in 2018, we repurchased $3.80 billion of Caterpillar common stock. In July 2018, the Board of Directors approved a new share repurchase authorization of up to $10 billion of Caterpillar common stock effective January 1, 2019, with no expiration. Our share repurchase plans are subject to the company cash deployment priorities and are evaluated on an ongoing basis; however, we plan to consistently repurchase common stock with the intent to, at a minimum, offset the impact of dilution over time. The timing and amount of future repurchases may vary depending on operating cash flow, market conditions and investing priorities. Caterpillar's basic shares outstanding as of December 31, 2018 were approximately 576 million. Financial Products Financial Products operating cash flow was $1.52 billion in 2018, compared with $1.35 billion in 2017. Net cash used for investing activities was $2.78 billion in 2018, compared with $596 million in 2017. The change was primarily due to the impact of portfolio related activity. Net cash provided by financing activities in 2018 was $1.26 billion, compared with net cash used for financing activities of $1.82 billion in 2017. The change was primarily due to higher portfolio funding requirements and a lower dividend payment to Machinery, Energy & Transportation. 48 Table of Contents Contractual obligations The company has committed cash outflow related to long-term debt, operating lease agreements, postretirement benefit obligations, purchase obligations, interest on long-term debt and other long-term contractual obligations. As of December 31, 2018 , minimum payments for these obligations were: (Millions of dollars) 2019 2020-2021 2022-2023 After 2023 Total Long-term debt: Machinery, Energy & Transportation (excluding capital leases) $ 2 $ 1,374 $ 588 $ 6,189 $ 8,153 Machinery, Energy & Transportation-capital leases 8 63 16 32 119 Financial Products 5,823 11,330 4,224 1,490 22,867 Total long-term debt 1 5,833 12,767 4,828 7,711 31,139 Operating leases 205 265 117 185 772 Postretirement benefit obligations 2 315 680 1,200 2,850 5,045 Purchase obligations: Accounts payable 3 7,051 7,051 Purchase orders 4 6,451 6,451 Other contractual obligations 5 267 41 308 Total purchase obligations 13,769 41 13,810 Interest on long-term debt 6 921 1,399 878 5,792 8,990 Other long-term obligations 7 564 819 416 362 2,161 Total contractual obligations $ 21,607 $ 15,971 $ 7,439 $ 16,900 $ 61,917 1 Amounts exclude unamortized discounts, a non-cash settlement for a capital lease, debt issuance costs, and fair value adjustments. 2 Amounts represent expected contributions to our pension and other postretirement benefit plans through 2028, offset by expected Medicare Part D subsidy receipts. 3 Amount represents invoices received and recorded as liabilities in 2018, but scheduled for payment in 2019. These represent short-term obligations made in the ordinary course of business. 4 Amount represents contractual obligations for material and services on order at December 31, 2018 but not yet delivered. These represent short-term obligations made in the ordinary course of business. 5 Amounts represent long-term commitments entered into with key suppliers for minimum purchases quantities. 6 Amounts represent estimated contractual interest payments on long-term debt, including capital lease interest payments. 7 Amounts represent contractual obligations primarily for logistics services agreements related to our former third party logistics business, software license and development contracts, IT consulting contracts and outsourcing contracts for benefit plan administration and software system support, and estimated income tax payments for mandatory deemed repatriation as a result of U.S. tax reform. The total amount of gross unrecognized tax benefits for uncertain tax positions, including positions impacting only the timing of tax benefits, was $1,796 million at December 31, 2018. Payment of these obligations would result from settlements with taxing authorities. Due to the difficulty in determining the timing of settlements, these obligations are not included in the table above. We do not expect to make a tax payment related to these obligations within the next year that would significantly impact liquidity. Off-balance sheet arrangements We are a party to certain off-balance sheet arrangements, primarily in the form of guarantees. Information related to guarantees appears in Note 21 Guarantees and product warranty of Part II, Item 8 Financial Statements and Supplementary Data . 49 Table of Contents CRITICAL ACCOUNTING POLICIES The preparation of financial statements in conformity with generally accepted accounting principles requires management to make estimates and assumptions that affect reported amounts. The more significant estimates include: residual values for leased assets, fair values for goodwill impairment tests, warranty liability, stock-based compensation, reserves for product liability and insurance losses, postretirement benefits, post-sale discounts, credit losses and income taxes. We have incorporated many years of data into the determination of each of these estimates and we have not historically experienced significant adjustments. These assumptions are reviewed at least annually with the Audit Committee of the Board of Directors. Following are the methods and assumptions used in determining our estimates and an indication of the risks inherent in each. Residual values for leased assets The residual values for Cat Financial leased assets, which are an estimate of the market value of leased equipment at the end of the lease term, are based on an analysis of historical wholesale market sales prices, projected forward on a level trend line without consideration for inflation or possible future pricing action. At the inception of the lease, residual values are estimated with consideration of the following critical factors: market size and demand, any known significant market/product trends, total expected hours of usage, machine configuration, application, location, model changes, quantities, past remarketing experience, third-party residual guarantees and contractual customer purchase options. Many of these factors are gathered in an application survey that is completed prior to quotation. The lease agreement also clearly defines applicable return conditions and remedies for non-compliance, to ensure that the leased equipment will be in good operating condition upon return. Model changes and updates, as well as market strength and product acceptance, are monitored and adjustments are made to residual values in accordance with the significance of any such changes. Remarketing sales staff works closely with customers and dealers to manage the sale of lease returns and the recovery of residual exposure. During the term of the equipment on operating leases, we evaluate our depreciation on a regular basis taking into consideration expected residual values at lease termination. Adjustments to depreciation expense reflecting revised estimates of expected residual values at the end of the lease terms are recorded prospectively on a straight-line basis. For finance leases, residual value adjustments are recognized through a reduction of finance revenue. We evaluate the carrying value of equipment on operating leases for potential impairment when we determine a triggering event has occurred. When a triggering event occurs, a test for recoverability is performed by comparing projected undiscounted future cash flows to the carrying value of the equipment on operating leases. If the test for recoverability identifies a possible impairment, the fair value of the equipment on operating leases is measured in accordance with the fair value measurement framework. An impairment charge is recognized for the amount by which the carrying value of the equipment on operating leases exceeds its estimated fair value. At December 31, 2018, the aggregate residual value of equipment on operating leases was $2.21 billion. Without consideration of other factors such as third-party residual guarantees or contractual customer purchase options, a 10% non-temporary decrease in the market value of our equipment subject to operating leases would reduce residual value estimates and result in the recognition of approximately $80 million of additional annual depreciation expense. Fair values for goodwill impairment tests We test goodwill for impairment annually, at the reporting unit level, and whenever events or circumstances make it more likely than not that an impairment may have occurred, such as a significant adverse change in the business climate or a decision to sell all or a portion of a reporting unit. We perform our annual goodwill impairment test as of October 1 and monitor for interim triggering events on an ongoing basis. Goodwill is reviewed for impairment utilizing either a qualitative assessment or a quantitative goodwill impairment test. If we choose to perform a qualitative assessment and determine the fair value more likely than not exceeds the carrying value, no further evaluation is necessary. For reporting units where we perform the quantitative goodwill impairment test, we compare the fair value of each reporting unit, which we primarily determine using an income approach based on the present value of discounted cash flows, to the respective carrying value, which includes goodwill. If the fair value of the reporting unit exceeds its carrying value, the goodwill is not considered impaired. Beginning in 2017, if the carrying value is higher than the fair value, the difference would be recognized as an impairment loss. Prior to 2017, a two-step process was used. For reporting units where we performed the two-step process, the first step required us to compare the fair value of each reporting unit, which we primarily determined using an income approach based on the present value of discounted cash flows, to the respective carrying value, which includes goodwill. If the fair value of the reporting unit exceeded its carrying value, the goodwill was not considered impaired. If the carrying value was higher than the fair value, there was an indication that an impairment may have existed and the second step was required. In step two, the implied fair value of goodwill was calculated as the excess of the fair value of a reporting unit over the fair values assigned to its assets and liabilities. If the implied fair value of goodwill was less than the carrying value of the reporting unit's goodwill, the difference was recognized as an impairment loss. 50 Table of Contents The impairment test process requires valuation of the respective reporting unit, which we primarily determine using an income approach based on a discounted five year forecasted cash flow with a year-five residual value. The residual value is computed using the constant growth method, which values the forecasted cash flows in perpetuity. The income approach is supported by a reconciliation of our calculated fair value for Caterpillar to the company's market capitalization. The assumptions about future cash flows and growth rates are based on each reporting unit's long-term forecast and are subject to review and approval by senior management. A reporting unit discount rate is a risk-adjusted weighted average cost of capital, which we believe approximates the rate from a market participant's perspective. The estimated fair value could be impacted by changes in market conditions, interest rates, growth rates, tax rates, costs, pricing and capital expenditures. The fair value determination is categorized as Level 3 in the fair value hierarchy due to its use of internal projections and unobservable measurement inputs. Our annual impairment tests completed in the fourth quarter of 2018 indicated the fair value of each reporting unit was substantially above its respective carrying value, including goodwill. Caterpillar market capitalization has remained significantly above the net book value of the Company. An unfavorable change in our expectations for the financial performance of our reporting units, particularly long-term growth and profitability, would reduce the fair value of our reporting units. The demand for our equipment and related parts is highly cyclical and significantly impacted by commodity prices, although the impact may vary by reporting unit. The energy and mining industries are major users of our products, including the coal, iron ore, gold, copper, oil and natural gas industries. Decisions to purchase our products are dependent upon the performance of those industries, which in turn are dependent in part on commodity prices. Lower commodity prices or industry specific circumstances that have a negative impact to the valuation assumptions may reduce the fair value of our reporting units. Should such events occur and it becomes more likely than not that a reporting unit's fair value has fallen below its carrying value, we will perform an interim goodwill impairment test(s), in addition to the annual impairment test. Future impairment tests may result in a goodwill impairment, depending on the outcome of the quantitative impairment test. A goodwill impairment would be reported as a non-cash charge to earnings. Warranty liability At the time a sale is recognized, we record estimated future warranty costs. The warranty liability is determined by applying historical claim rate experience to the current field population and dealer inventory. Generally, historical claim rates are based on actual warranty experience for each product by machine model/engine size by customer or dealer location (inside or outside North America). Specific rates are developed for each product shipment month and are updated monthly based on actual warranty claim experience. Warranty costs may differ from those estimated if actual claim rates are higher or lower than our historical rates. Stock-based compensation We use a lattice-based option-pricing model to calculate the fair value of our stock options and stock appreciation rights (SARs). The calculation of the fair value of the awards using the lattice-based option-pricing model is affected by our stock price on the date of grant as well as assumptions regarding the following: Volatility is a measure of the amount by which the stock price is expected to fluctuate each year during the expected term of the award and is based on historical Caterpillar stock price movement and current implied volatilities from traded options on Caterpillar stock. The implied volatilities from traded options are impacted by changes in market conditions. An increase in the volatility would result in an increase in our expense. The expected term represents the period of time that awards granted are expected to be outstanding and is an output of the lattice-based option-pricing model. In determining the expected term of the award, future exercise and forfeiture patterns are estimated from Caterpillar employee historical exercise behavior. These patterns are also affected by the vesting conditions of the award. Changes in the future exercise behavior of employees or in the vesting period of the award could result in a change in the expected term. An increase in the expected term would result in an increase to our expense. The weighted-average dividend yield is based on Caterpillar historical dividend yields. As holders of stock options and SARs do not receive dividend payments, this could result in employees retaining the award for a longer period of time if dividend yields decrease or exercising the award sooner if dividend yields increase. A decrease in the dividend yield would result in an increase in our expense. The risk-free interest rate is based on the U.S. Treasury yield curve in effect at time of grant. As the risk-free interest rate increases, the expected term increases, resulting in an increase in our expense. Beginning in 2018, the fair value of Restricted Stock Units (RSUs) and Performance-based Restricted Stock Units (PRSUs) is determined as the closing stock price on the date of grant, as holders of these awards are credited with dividend equivalent units on each date that a cash dividend is paid to holders of Common Stock. Prior to 2018, RSUs and PRSUs were not credited dividend equivalent units and the fair value was determined by reducing the stock price on the date of grant by the present value of the estimated dividends to be paid during the vesting period. The estimated dividends were based on Caterpillar quarterly dividend per share at the time of grant. 51 Table of Contents Stock-based compensation expense is recognized based on the grant date fair value. Forfeitures are accounted for in the period they occur as a reduction to expense. Stock-based compensation expense for PRSUs is based on the probable number of shares expected to vest. Changes in the expected probability of achieving performance targets in future periods may result in an increase or decrease in our expense. Product liability and insurance loss reserve We determine these reserves based upon reported claims in process of settlement and actuarial estimates for losses incurred but not reported. Loss reserves, including incurred but not reported reserves, are based on estimates and ultimate settlements may vary significantly from such estimates due to increased claims frequency or severity over historical levels. Postretirement benefits Primary actuarial assumptions were determined as follows: The assumed discount rate is used to discount future benefit obligations back to today dollars. The U.S. discount rate is based on a benefit cash flow-matching approach and represents the rate at which our benefit obligations could effectively be settled as of our measurement date, December 31. The benefit cash flow-matching approach involves analyzing Caterpillar projected cash flows against a high quality bond yield curve, calculated using a wide population of corporate Aa bonds available on the measurement date. A similar approach is used to determine the assumed discount rate for our most significant non-U.S. plans. In estimating the service and interest cost components of net periodic benefit cost, we utilize a full yield curve approach in determining a discount rate. This approach applies the specific spot rates along the yield curve used in the determination of the benefit obligation to the relevant projected cash flows. Discount rates are sensitive to changes in interest rates. A decrease in the discount rate would increase our obligation and future expense. The expected long-term rate of return on plan assets is based on our estimate of long-term passive returns for equities and fixed income securities weighted by the allocation of our plan assets. Based on historical performance, we increase the passive returns due to our active management of the plan assets. This rate is impacted by changes in general market conditions, but because it represents a long-term rate, it is not significantly impacted by short-term market swings. Changes in our allocation of plan assets would also impact this rate. For example, a shift to more fixed income securities would lower the rate. A decrease in the rate would increase our expense. The expected return on plan assets is calculated using the fair value of plan assets as of our measurement date, December 31. The expected rate of compensation increase is used to develop benefit obligations using projected pay at retirement. It represents average long-term salary increases. This rate is influenced by our long-term compensation policies. An increase in the rate would increase our obligation and expense. The assumed health care trend rate represents the rate at which health care costs are assumed to increase and is based on historical and expected experience. Changes in our projections of future health care costs due to general economic conditions and those specific to health care (e.g., technology driven cost changes) will impact this trend rate. An increase in the trend rate would increase our obligation and expense. The effects of actual results differing from our assumptions and the effects of changing assumptions are considered actuarial gains or losses. We recognize actuarial gains or losses immediately through earnings upon the annual remeasurement in the fourth quarter, or on an interim basis as triggering events warrant remeasurement. See Note 12 for further information regarding the accounting for postretirement benefits. Post-sale discount reserve We provide discounts to dealers through merchandising programs. We have numerous programs that are designed to promote the sale of our products. The most common dealer programs provide a discount when the dealer sells a product to a targeted end user. The amount of accrued post-sale discounts was $1,544 million and $1,426 million as of December 31, 2018 and 2017 , respectively. The reserve represents discounts that we expect to pay on previously sold units and is reviewed at least quarterly. The reserve is adjusted if discounts paid differ from those estimated. Historically, those adjustments have not been material. Credit loss reserve The allowance for credit losses is an estimate of the losses inherent in our finance receivable portfolio and includes consideration of accounts that have been individually identified as impaired, as well as pools of finance receivables where it is probable that certain receivables in the pool are impaired but the individual accounts cannot yet be identified. In identifying and measuring impairment, management takes into consideration past loss experience, known and inherent risks in the portfolio, 52 Table of Contents adverse situations that may affect the borrower ability to repay, estimated value of underlying collateral and current economic conditions. Accounts are identified for individual review based on past-due status and information available about the customer, such as financial statements, news reports and published credit ratings, as well as general information regarding industry trends and the economic environment in which our customers operate. The allowance for credit losses attributable to finance receivables that are individually evaluated and determined to be impaired is based on the present value of expected future cash flows discounted at the receivables effective interest rate, the fair value of the collateral for collateral-dependent receivables or the observable market price of the receivable. In determining collateral value, we estimate the current fair market value of the collateral less selling costs. We also consider credit enhancements such as additional collateral and contractual third-party guarantees. The allowance for credit losses attributable to the remaining accounts not yet individually identified as impaired is estimated based on loss forecast models utilizing probabilities of default, our estimate of the loss emergence period and the estimated loss given default. In addition, qualitative factors not able to be fully captured in our loss forecast models including industry trends, macroeconomic factors and model imprecision are considered in the evaluation of the adequacy of the allowance for credit losses. These qualitative factors are subjective and require a degree of management judgment. While management believes it has exercised prudent judgment and applied reasonable assumptions, there can be no assurance that in the future, changes in economic conditions or other factors would not cause changes in the financial health of our customers. If the financial health of our customers deteriorates, the timing and level of payments received could be impacted and therefore, could result in a change to our estimated losses. Income taxes We are subject to the income tax laws of the many jurisdictions in which we operate. These tax laws are complex, and the manner in which they apply to our facts is sometimes open to interpretation. In establishing the provision for income taxes, we must make judgments about the application of these inherently complex tax laws. Our income tax positions and analysis are based on currently enacted tax law. Future changes in tax law or related interpretations could significantly impact the provision for income taxes, the amount of taxes payable, and the deferred tax asset and liability balances. Changes in tax law are reflected in the period of enactment with related interpretations considered in the period received. On January 15, 2019, the U.S. Treasury issued final regulations providing additional guidance related to the calculation of the mandatory deemed repatriation of non-U.S. earnings. We are currently evaluating the impact of these regulations and will recognize any resulting adjustments in the first quarter of 2019. Despite our belief that our tax return positions are consistent with applicable tax laws, we believe that taxing authorities could challenge certain positions. Settlement of any challenge can result in no change, a complete disallowance, or some partial adjustment reached through negotiations or litigation. We record tax benefits for uncertain tax positions based upon management evaluation of the information available at the reporting date. To be recognized in the financial statements, a tax benefit must be at least more likely than not of being sustained based on technical merits. The benefit for positions meeting the recognition threshold is measured as the largest benefit more likely than not of being realized upon ultimate settlement with a taxing authority that has full knowledge of all relevant information. Significant judgment is required in making these determinations and adjustments to unrecognized tax benefits may be necessary to reflect actual taxes payable upon settlement. Adjustments related to positions impacting the effective tax rate affect the provision for income taxes. Adjustments related to positions impacting the timing of deductions impact deferred tax assets and liabilities. For tax years 2007 to 2012 including the impact of a loss carryback to 2005, the IRS has proposed to tax in the United States profits earned from certain parts transactions by Caterpillar SARL (CSARL), based on the IRS examination team application of substance-over-form or assignment-of-income judicial doctrines. CSARL is primarily taxable locally in Switzerland. We are vigorously contesting the proposed increases to tax and penalties for these years of approximately $2.3 billion. We believe that the relevant transactions complied with applicable tax laws and did not violate judicial doctrines. The purchase of parts by CSARL from unrelated parties and the subsequent sale of those parts to unrelated dealers outside the United States have substantial legal, commercial, and economic consequences for the parties involved. Therefore, we have concluded that the largest amount of benefit that is more likely than not to be sustained related to this position is the entire benefit. As a result, no amount related to these IRS adjustments is reflected in unrecognized tax benefits. We have filed U.S. income tax returns on this same basis for years after 2012. We currently believe the ultimate disposition of this matter will not have a material adverse effect on our consolidated financial position, liquidity or results of operations. Deferred tax assets generally represent tax benefits for tax deductions or credits available in future tax returns. Certain estimates and assumptions are required to determine whether it is more likely than not that all or some portion of the benefit of a deferred tax asset will not be realized. In making this assessment, management analyzes the trend of U.S. GAAP earnings and estimates the impact of future taxable income, reversing temporary differences and available prudent and feasible tax planning strategies. We give less weight in this analysis to mark-to-market adjustments to remeasure our pension and OPEB plans as we do not consider these adjustments indicative of ongoing earnings trends. Should a change in facts or circumstances lead to a change in judgment 53 Table of Contents about the ultimate realizability of a deferred tax asset, we record or adjust the related valuation allowance in the period that the change in facts and circumstances occurs, along with a corresponding increase or decrease in the provision for income taxes. OTHER MATTERS ENVIRONMENTAL AND LEGAL MATTERS The Company is regulated by federal, state and international environmental laws governing our use, transport and disposal of substances and control of emissions. In addition to governing our manufacturing and other operations, these laws often impact the development of our products, including, but not limited to, required compliance with air emissions standards applicable to internal combustion engines. We have made, and will continue to make, significant research and development and capital expenditures to comply with these emissions standards. We are engaged in remedial activities at a number of locations, often with other companies, pursuant to federal and state laws. When it is probable we will pay remedial costs at a site, and those costs can be reasonably estimated, the investigation, remediation, and operating and maintenance costs are accrued against our earnings. Costs are accrued based on consideration of currently available data and information with respect to each individual site, including available technologies, current applicable laws and regulations, and prior remediation experience. Where no amount within a range of estimates is more likely, we accrue the minimum. Where multiple potentially responsible parties are involved, we consider our proportionate share of the probable costs. In formulating the estimate of probable costs, we do not consider amounts expected to be recovered from insurance companies or others. We reassess these accrued amounts on a quarterly basis. The amount recorded for environmental remediation is not material and is included in Accrued expenses. We believe there is no more than a remote chance that a material amount for remedial activities at any individual site, or at all the sites in the aggregate, will be required. On January 7, 2015, the Company received a grand jury subpoena from the U.S. District Court for the Central District of Illinois. The subpoena requests documents and information from the Company relating to, among other things, financial information concerning U.S. and non-U.S. Caterpillar subsidiaries (including undistributed profits of non-U.S. subsidiaries and the movement of cash among U.S. and non-U.S. subsidiaries). The Company has received additional subpoenas relating to this investigation requesting additional documents and information relating to, among other things, the purchase and resale of replacement parts by Caterpillar Inc. and non-U.S. Caterpillar subsidiaries, dividend distributions of certain non-U.S. Caterpillar subsidiaries, and Caterpillar SARL and related structures. On March 2-3, 2017, agents with the Department of Commerce, the Federal Deposit Insurance Corporation and the Internal Revenue Service executed search and seizure warrants at three facilities of the Company in the Peoria, Illinois area, including its former corporate headquarters. The warrants identify, and agents seized, documents and information related to, among other things, the export of products from the United States, the movement of products between the United States and Switzerland, the relationship between Caterpillar Inc. and Caterpillar SARL, and sales outside the United States. It is the Company understanding that the warrants, which concern both tax and export activities, are related to the ongoing grand jury investigation. The Company is continuing to cooperate with this investigation. The Company is unable to predict the outcome or reasonably estimate any potential loss; however, we currently believe that this matter will not have a material adverse effect on the Company consolidated results of operations, financial position or liquidity. On March 20, 2014, Brazil Administrative Council for Economic Defense (CADE) published a Technical Opinion which named 18 companies and over 100 individuals as defendants, including two subsidiaries of Caterpillar Inc., MGE - Equipamentos e Servi os Ferrovi rios Ltda. (MGE) and Caterpillar Brasil Ltda. The publication of the Technical Opinion opened CADE's official administrative investigation into allegations that the defendants participated in anticompetitive bid activity for the construction and maintenance of metro and train networks in Brazil. While companies cannot be held criminally liable for anticompetitive conduct in Brazil, criminal charges have been brought against two current employees of MGE and one former employee of MGE involving the same conduct alleged by CADE. The Company has responded to all requests for information from the authorities. The Company is unable to predict the outcome or reasonably estimate the potential loss; however, we currently believe that this matter will not have a material adverse effect on the Company's consolidated results of operations, financial position or liquidity. In addition, we are involved in other unresolved legal actions that arise in the normal course of business. The most prevalent of these unresolved actions involve disputes related to product design, manufacture and performance liability (including claimed asbestos and welding fumes exposure), contracts, employment issues, environmental matters, intellectual property rights, taxes (other than income taxes) and securities laws. The aggregate range of reasonably possible losses in excess of accrued liabilities, if any, associated with these unresolved legal actions is not material. In some cases, we cannot reasonably estimate a range of loss because there is insufficient information regarding the matter. However, we believe there is no more than a remote chance that any liability arising from these matters would be material. Although it is not possible to predict with certainty the outcome of these unresolved legal actions, we believe that these actions will not individually or in the aggregate have a material adverse effect on our consolidated results of operations, financial position or liquidity. 54 Table of Contents RETIREMENT BENEFITS We recognize mark-to-market gains and losses immediately through earnings upon the remeasurement of our pension and OPEB plans. Mark-to-market gains and losses represent the effects of actual results differing from our assumptions and the effects of changing assumptions. Changes in discount rates and differences between the actual return on plan assets and the expected return on plan assets generally have the largest impact on mark-to-market gains and losses. We recognized expense of $415 million, $342 million and $957 million in 2018, 2017 and 2016, respectively, related to our defined benefit pension and OPEB plans. The increase in expense in 2018 compared to 2017 was primarily due to higher net mark-to-market losses in 2018 compared to 2017. This was partially offset by a higher expected return on plan assets and curtailment gains compared to curtailment and termination charges in 2017. The decrease in expense in 2017 compared to 2016 was primarily due to lower net mark-to-market losses in 2017 compared to 2016. This was partially offset by an unfavorable change in amortization of prior service credits, curtailment and termination charges and a lower expected return on plan assets. The primary factors that resulted in mark-to-market losses for 2018, 2017 and 2016 are described below. The net mark-to-market losses were included in Other income (expense) in the Results of Operations. 2018 net mark-to-market loss of $495 million - Primarily due to the difference between the actual return on plan assets compared to the expected return on plan assets (U.S. pension plans had an actual rate of return of negative 5.4 percent compared to an expected rate of return of 6.3 percent). This was partially offset by higher discount rates at the end of 2018 compared to the end of 2017. 2017 net mark-to-market loss of $301 million - Primarily due to lower discount rates at the end of 2017 compared to the end of 2016 and changes in our mortality assumption (discussed below). This was partially offset by the difference between the actual return on plan assets compared to the expected return on plan assets (U.S. pension plans had an actual rate of return of 15.5 percent compared to an expected rate of return of 6.7 percent). 2016 net mark-to-market loss of $985 million - Primarily due to lower discount rates at the end of 2016 compared to the end of 2015 and changes in our U.S. mortality assumption (discussed below). This was partially offset by the difference between the actual return on plan assets compared to the expected return on plan assets (U.S. pension plans had an actual rate of return of 7.8 percent compared to an expected rate of return of 6.9 percent). In the fourth quarter of 2017, the company reviewed and made changes to the mortality assumptions primarily for our U.S. pension plans which resulted in an overall increase in the life expectancy of plan participants. As of December 31, 2017 these changes resulted in an increase in our Liability for postemployment benefits of approximately $290 million. In the fourth quarter of 2016, the company adopted new mortality improvement scales released by the Society of Actuaries for our U.S. pension and OPEB plans. As of December 31, 2016, this resulted in an increase in our Liability for postemployment benefits of approximately $200 million. In the first quarter of 2017, we announced the closure of our Gosselies, Belgium facility. This announcement impacted certain employees that participated in a defined benefit pension plan and resulted in a net loss of $20 million in the first quarter of 2017 for curtailment and termination benefits. We expect our total defined benefit pension and OPEB expense (excluding the impact of mark-to-market gains and losses) to increase approximately $260 million in 2019. This increase is primarily due to a lower expected return on plan assets (U.S. pension plans have an expected rate of return of 5.9 percent in 2019 compared to 6.3 percent in 2018). In general, our strategy for both the U.S. and the non-U.S. pensions includes ongoing alignment of our investments to our liabilities, while reducing risk in our portfolio. For our U.S. pension plans, our year-end 2018 asset allocation was 70 percent fixed income, 27 percent equities and 3 percent other. Our current U.S. pension target asset allocation is 70 percent fixed income and 30 percent equities. The target allocation is revisited periodically to ensure it reflects our overall objectives. The U.S. plans are rebalanced to within the appropriate target asset allocation ranges on a monthly basis. The year-end 2018 asset allocation for our non-U.S. pension plans was 78 percent fixed income, 13 percent equities, 5 percent real estate and 4 percent other. The 2018 weighted-average target allocation for our non-U.S. pension plans was also 78 percent fixed income, 13 percent equities, 5 percent real estate and 4 percent other. The target allocations for each plan vary based upon local statutory requirements, demographics of the plan participants and funded status. The frequency of rebalancing for the non-U.S. plans varies depending on the plan. 55 Table of Contents Contributions to our pension and OPEB plans were $1.4 billion and $1.6 billion in 2018 and 2017, respectively. Both years included a $1.0 billion discretionary contribution to our U.S. pension plans. We expect to make approximately $315 million of contributions to our pension and OPEB plans in 2019. We believe we have adequate resources to fund both pension and OPEB plans. Effective January 1, 2018, we adopted new accounting guidance issued by the FASB related to the presentation of net periodic pension costs and net periodic postretirement benefit costs. The change in presentation was applied retrospectively to prior years. For further information see Note 1J - "Operations and summary of significant accounting policies - New Accounting Guidance" of Part II, Item 8 "Financial Statements and Supplementary Data." Actuarial assumptions have a significant impact on both pension and OPEB expenses. The effects of a one percentage point change in our primary actuarial assumptions on 2018 benefit costs and year-end obligations are included in the table below. 56 Table of Contents Postretirement Benefit Plan Actuarial Assumptions Sensitivity The effects of a one percentage-point change in our primary actuarial assumptions on 2018 pension and OPEB costs and obligations are as follows: 2018 Benefit Cost Year-end Benefit Obligation (Millions of dollars) One percentage- point increase One percentage- point decrease One percentage- point increase One percentage- point decrease U.S. Pension benefits: Assumed discount rate $ 64 $ (85 ) $ (1,625 ) $ 1,970 Expected rate of compensation increase 1 (2 ) 5 (5 ) Expected long-term rate of return on plan assets (129 ) 129 Non-U.S. Pension benefits: Assumed discount rate 7 (11 ) (560 ) 720 Expected rate of compensation increase 7 (6 ) 41 (36 ) Expected long-term rate of return on plan assets (42 ) 42 Other postretirement benefits: Assumed discount rate 9 (12 ) (318 ) 377 Expected rate of compensation increase Expected long-term rate of return on plan assets (4 ) 4 Assumed health care cost trend rate 14 (11 ) 138 (117 ) Primary Actuarial Assumptions U.S. Pension Benefits Non-U.S. Pension Benefits Other Postretirement Benefits 2018 2017 2016 2018 2017 2016 2018 2017 2016 Weighted-average assumptions used to determine benefit obligations, end of year: Discount rate 4.2 % 3.5 % 4.0 % 2.5 % 2.4 % 2.5 % 4.2 % 3.6 % 4.0 % Rate of compensation increase 4.0 % 4.0 % 4.0 % 3.0 % 4.0 % 4.0 % 4.0 % 4.0 % 4.0 % Weighted-average assumptions used to determine net cost: Discount rate used to measure service cost 3.7 % 4.2 % 4.5 % 2.3 % 2.4 % 2.9 % 3.5 % 3.9 % 4.2 % Discount rate used to measure interest cost 3.2 % 3.3 % 3.4 % 2.2 % 2.3 % 2.8 % 3.2 % 3.3 % 3.3 % Expected rate of return on plan assets 6.3 % 6.7 % 6.9 % 5.2 % 5.9 % 6.1 % 7.5 % 7.5 % 7.5 % Rate of compensation increase 4.0 % 4.0 % 4.0 % 4.0 % 4.0 % 3.6 % 4.0 % 4.0 % 4.0 % Health care cost trend rates at year-end: Health care trend rate assumed for next year 6.1 % 6.1 % 6.6 % Rate that the cost trend rate gradually declines to 5.0 % 5.0 % 5.0 % Year that the cost trend rate reaches ultimate rate 2025 2022 2022 SENSITIVITY Foreign Exchange Rate Sensitivity Machinery, Energy & Transportation operations use foreign currency forward and option contracts to manage unmatched foreign currency cash inflow and outflow. Our objective is to minimize the risk of exchange rate movements that would reduce the U.S. dollar value of our foreign currency cash flow. Our policy allows for managing anticipated foreign currency cash flow for up to 57 Table of Contents five years. Based on the anticipated and firmly committed cash inflow and outflow for our Machinery, Energy & Transportation operations for the next 12 months and the foreign currency derivative instruments in place at year-end, a hypothetical 10 percent weakening of the U.S. dollar relative to all other currencies would adversely affect our expected 2019 cash flow for our Machinery, Energy & Transportation operations by approximately $250 million. Last year similar assumptions and calculations yielded a potential $200 million adverse impact on 2018 cash flow. We determine our net exposures by calculating the difference in cash inflow and outflow by currency and adding or subtracting outstanding foreign currency derivative instruments. We multiply these net amounts by 10 percent to determine the sensitivity. Since our policy for Financial Products operations is to hedge the foreign exchange risk when the currency of our debt portfolio does not match the currency of our receivable portfolio, a 10 percent change in the value of the U.S. dollar relative to all other currencies would not have a material effect on our consolidated financial position, results of operations or cash flow. Neither our policy nor the effect of a 10 percent change in the value of the U.S. dollar has changed from that reported at the end of last year. The effect of the hypothetical change in exchange rates ignores the effect this movement may have on other variables, including competitive risk. If it were possible to quantify this competitive impact, the results would probably be different from the sensitivity effects shown above. In addition, it is unlikely that all currencies would uniformly strengthen or weaken relative to the U.S. dollar. In reality, some currencies may weaken while others may strengthen. Our primary exposure (excluding competitive risk) is to exchange rate movements in the Japanese yen, British pound, Indian rupee, Swiss franc and Australian dollar. Interest Rate Sensitivity For our Machinery, Energy & Transportation operations, we have the option to use interest rate contracts to lower the cost of borrowed funds by attaching fixed-to-floating interest rate contracts to fixed-rate debt, and by entering into forward rate agreements on future debt issuances. A hypothetical 100 basis point adverse move in interest rates along the entire interest rate yield curve would have a minimal impact to the 2019 pre-tax earnings of Machinery, Energy & Transportation. Last year, similar assumptions and calculations yielded a minimal impact to 2018 pre-tax earnings. For our Financial Products operations, we use interest rate derivative instruments primarily to meet our match-funding objectives and strategies. We have a match-funding policy whereby the interest rate profile (fixed or floating rate) of our debt portfolio is matched to the interest rate profile of our earning asset portfolio (finance receivables and operating leases) within certain parameters. In connection with that policy, we use interest rate derivative instruments to modify the debt structure. Match funding assists us in maintaining our interest rate spreads, regardless of the direction interest rates move. In order to properly manage sensitivity to changes in interest rates, Financial Products measures the potential impact of different interest rate assumptions on pre-tax earnings. All on-balance sheet positions, including derivative financial instruments, are included in the analysis. The primary assumptions included in the analysis are that there are no new fixed rate assets or liabilities, the proportion of fixed rate debt to fixed rate assets remains unchanged and the level of floating rate assets and debt remain constant. An analysis of the December 31, 2018 balance sheet, using these assumptions, estimates the impact of a 100 basis point immediate and sustained adverse change in interest rates to have a minimal impact on 2019 pre-tax earnings. Last year, similar assumptions and calculations yielded a minimal impact to 2018 pre-tax earnings. This analysis does not necessarily represent our current outlook of future market interest rate movement, nor does it consider any actions management could undertake in response to changes in interest rates. Accordingly, no assurance can be given that actual results would be consistent with the results of our estimate. NON-GAAP FINANCIAL MEASURES The following definitions are provided for the non-GAAP financial measures used in this report. These non-GAAP financial measures have no standardized meaning prescribed by U.S. GAAP and therefore are unlikely to be comparable to the calculation of similar measures for other companies. Management does not intend these items to be considered in isolation or as a substitute for the related GAAP measures. We believe it is important to separately quantify the profit impact of several significant items in order for our results to be meaningful to our readers. These items consist of (i) restructuring costs, which are incurred in the current year to generate longer term benefits, (ii) pension and OPEB mark-to-market losses resulting from plan remeasurements, (iii) certain deferred tax valuation allowance adjustments, (iv) U.S. tax reform impact and (v) a gain on the sale of an equity investment. We do not consider these items indicative of earnings from ongoing business activities and believe the non-GAAP measures will provide useful perspective on underlying business results and trends, and a means to assess our period-over-period results. 58 Table of Contents Reconciliations of adjusted operating profit margin to the most directly comparable GAAP measure, operating profit as a percent of sales and revenues are as follows: Three Months Ended December 31, Twelve Months Ended December 31, 2018 2017 2018 2017 Operating profit as a percent of total sales and revenues 13.1 % 10.8 % 15.2 % 9.8 % Restructuring costs 0.7 % 1.9 % 0.7 % 2.7 % Adjusted operating profit margin 13.8 % 12.7 % 15.9 % 12.5 % Reconciliations of adjusted profit before taxes to the most directly comparable GAAP measure, consolidated profit before taxes, are as follows: Three Months Ended December 31, Twelve Months Ended December 31, (millions of dollars) 2018 2017 2018 2017 Profit before taxes $ 1,367 $ 1,111 $ 7,822 $ 4,082 Restructuring costs $ 93 $ 245 $ 386 $ 1,256 Mark-to-market losses $ 495 $ 301 $ 495 $ 301 Gain on sale of equity investment $ $ $ $ (85 ) Adjusted profit before taxes $ 1,955 $ 1,657 $ 8,703 $ 5,554 Reconciliations of adjusted profit per share to the most directly comparable GAAP measure, diluted profit per share, are as follows: Three Months Ended December 31, Twelve Months Ended December 31, 2018 2017 2018 2017 Profit (Loss) per share - diluted $ 1.78 $ (2.18 ) $ 10.26 $ 1.26 Per share restructuring costs 1 $ 0.13 $ 0.31 $ 0.50 $ 1.68 Per share mark-to-market losses 2 $ 0.66 $ 0.26 $ 0.64 $ 0.26 Per share deferred tax valuation allowance adjustments $ (0.11 ) $ (0.18 ) $ (0.01 ) $ (0.18 ) Per share U.S. tax reform impact $ 0.09 $ 3.91 $ (0.17 ) $ 3.95 Per share gain on sale of equity investment 2 $ $ $ $ (0.09 ) Adjusted profit per share $ 2.55 $ 2.16 $ 11.22 $ 6.88 1 At statutory tax rates. 2017 is prior to consideration of U.S. tax reform.
