ITEM 7. MANAGEMENT'S DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS OF FINANCIAL CONDITION AND RESULTS OF OPERATIONS The following discussion and analysis of our financial condition and results of operations should be read in conjunction with our Consolidated Financial Statements and the accompanying notes included elsewhere in this Annual Report. The following discussion may contain forward-looking statements that reflect our plans, estimates, and beliefs. Our actual results could differ materially from those discussed in these forward-looking statements. Factors that could cause or contribute to these differences include those factors discussed below and elsewhere in this Annual Report, particularly in "Risk Factors" and "Forward-Looking Information." Our Consolidated Financial Statements have been prepared in United States Dollars, in accordance with accounting principles generally accepted in the United States of America ("GAAP"). The Separation Tyco Electronics Ltd. was incorporated in Bermuda in fiscal 2000 as a wholly-owned subsidiary of then Bermuda-based Tyco International. For the period following its incorporation, Tyco Electronics Ltd. did not engage in any significant business activities and held minimal assets. Effective June 29, 2007, we became the parent company of the former electronics businesses of Tyco International. On June 29, 2007, Tyco International distributed all of its shares of Tyco Electronics, as well as its shares of its former healthcare businesses, to its common shareholders. Change of Domicile Effective June 25, 2009, Tyco Electronics Ltd. discontinued its existence as a Bermuda company as provided in the Bermuda Companies Act, and, in accordance with article 161 of the Swiss Federal Code on International Private Law, continued its existence as a Swiss corporation under articles 620 et seq. of the Swiss Code of Obligations. The rights of holders of our shares are governed by Swiss law, our Swiss articles of association, and our Swiss organizational regulations. Overview We are a leading global provider of engineered electronic components, network solutions, specialty products, and subsea communication systems. We design, manufacture, and market approximately 450,000 different products for customers in a broad array of industries including automotive; data communications equipment and consumer electronics; telecommunications; aerospace, defense, and marine; medical; energy; and lighting. We believe the end markets that we sell into are balanced with the total end market demand for our products. Our Electronic Components segment serves both consumer and industrial and infrastructure markets with 70% of sales occurring in the consumer based markets. Our Network Solutions, Specialty Products, and Subsea Communications segments serve primarily industrial and infrastructure based markets. We operate through four reporting segments: Electronic Components, Network Solutions, Specialty Products, and Subsea Communications. See Notes 1 and 24 to the Consolidated Financial Statements for additional information regarding our segments. We service our customers primarily through our direct sales force that serves customers in over 150 countries. The sales force is supported by approximately 7,000 engineers as well as globally deployed manufacturing sites. Through our sales force and engineering resources, we are able to collaborate with our customers throughout the world to provide highly engineered products and solutions to meet their needs. 35 Table of Contents Our strategic objective is to increase our revenue and profitability across all of our segments in the markets we serve. This strategy is dependent upon the following strategic priorities: Deliver extraordinary customer service; Strengthen our innovation leadership; Achieve market leadership in attractive and under-penetrated industries; Extend our leadership in emerging markets; and Supplement organic growth with strategic partnerships and acquisitions. Economic Conditions Our business and operating results have been and will continue to be affected by regional and worldwide economic conditions. Our sales are dependent on certain industry end markets that are impacted by consumer as well as industrial and infrastructure spending, and our operating results can be adversely affected by reduced demand in those markets. Overall, we experienced a 17.7% increase in net sales in fiscal 2010 as compared to fiscal 2009. In fiscal 2009, net sales decreased 28.6% as compared to fiscal 2008. Our sales into consumer based markets, particularly in the automotive and appliance end markets, and to a lesser degree, our sales into the computer end market, all in our Electronic Components segment, have improved relative to last year but still remain below fiscal 2008 levels. Sales in the industrial and infrastructure end markets served by our Network Solutions segment improved in fiscal 2010, marginally exceeding sales of fiscal 2009 but remained below fiscal 2008 levels as these are later cycle markets. Sales in fiscal 2010 in our Specialty Products segment continued to improve and were above fiscal 2009 levels, but remained below fiscal 2008 sales levels. Relative to the fourth quarter of fiscal 2010, we expect first quarter sales in the consumer based markets to increase slightly, with a modest decrease in the industrial and infrastructure based markets. On a company-wide basis, net sales in the first quarter of fiscal 2011 are expected to be between $3.05 and $3.15 billion, an increase of 5 to 9 percent over the same period of fiscal 2010. For fiscal 2011, which will be 53 weeks in length, we expect net sales to increase 6 to 9 percent from fiscal 2010 levels and to be between $12.8 and $13.2 billion. In the first fiscal quarter of 2011, we expect diluted earnings per share to be in the range of $0.63 to $0.67 per share. For fiscal 2011, we expect diluted earnings per share to be in the range of $2.80 to $3.00 per share with approximately $0.05 per share attributable to the additional week. This outlook assumes current foreign exchange and commodity rates and does not include results related to the anticipated acquisition of ADC. We are monitoring the current environment and its potential effects on our customers and on the end markets we serve. Additionally, we continue to closely manage our costs in order to respond to changing conditions. We are also managing our capital resources and monitoring capital availability to ensure that we have sufficient resources to fund our future capital needs. (See further discussion in "Liquidity and Capital Resources.") Acquisitions On August 6, 2010, we acquired the remaining outstanding equity interests of PlanarMag, Inc. ("PlanarMag") for $23 million in cash and the forgiveness of an approximate $1 million loan payable. Prior to the acquisition, we owned approximately 14% of PlanarMag. The net assets acquired, which are not material, are reported as part of the Communications and Industrial Solutions business within the Electronic Components segment. On May 14, 2010, we acquired certain assets of the Optical Products Group of Zarlink Semiconductor Inc. ("Zarlink") for $15 million in cash. The assets acquired, primarily definite-lived 36 Table of Contents intangible assets, inventory, and property, plant, and equipment, are reported as part of the Communications and Industrial Solutions business within the Electronic Components segment. On January 20, 2010, we acquired 100% of the outstanding shares of capital stock of Sensitive Object, an early-stage software company engaged in developing touch-enabling technology focused on computers, mobile devices, and consumer electronics, for a purchase price of approximately $67 million in cash, including contingent consideration of $6 million to be paid in fiscal 2011 upon completion of certain service requirements by key Sensitive Object managers. The acquisition complements our existing Touch Systems business, which is primarily focused on commercial and industrial markets. Sensitive Object is reported as part of our Touch Systems business within the Specialty Products segment. See Note 6 to the Consolidated Financial Statements for additional information regarding acquisitions. Anticipated Acquisition On July 12, 2010, we entered into an Agreement and Plan of Merger (the "Merger Agreement") with ADC under which we agreed to acquire ADC for a total purchase price of approximately $1.25 billion. Pursuant to the Merger Agreement, we commenced a tender offer to purchase all of the issued and outstanding shares of ADC common stock at a purchase price of $12.75 per share in cash followed by a merger with and into ADC. The initial offer, dated July 26, 2010, has been extended to November 15, 2010. As of October 18, 2010, approximately 86.5 million common shares of ADC had been tendered and not withdrawn pursuant to the tender offer, representing approximately 89% of the outstanding common shares of ADC. In accordance with the terms of the tender offer, ADC shareholders have the right to withdraw their previously tendered shares prior to the expiration of the offer. The transaction is expected to be completed during the first quarter of fiscal 2011. The consummation of the transaction is subject to various closing conditions including the tender of a majority of ADC's shares, regulatory approvals, and other customary conditions. The Merger Agreement also includes customary termination provisions for both ADC and us and provides that, in connection with the termination of the Merger Agreement under specified circumstances, ADC will be required to pay us a termination fee of $38 million. See Note 6 to the Consolidated Financial Statements for additional information regarding acquisitions. Divestitures During fiscal 2010, we sold our mechatronics business within the Electronic Components segment for net cash proceeds of $3 million. This business designs and manufactures customer-specific components, primarily for the automotive industry, and generated sales of approximately $100 million in fiscal 2010. In connection with the sale, we recorded a pre-tax loss on sale of $41 million. Also, in fiscal 2010, we completed the sale of the Dulmison connectors and fittings product line which was part of our energy business in the Network Solutions segment for net cash proceeds of $12 million. In connection with the divestiture, we recorded a pre-tax impairment charge related to long-lived assets and a pre-tax loss on sale of $12 million and $1 million, respectively, in fiscal 2010. Also, we recorded a pre-tax impairment charge of $12 million in fiscal 2009 to write the carrying value of the assets and liabilities down to fair value. The Dulmison connectors and fittings product line generated sales of approximately $50 million in fiscal 2009. During fiscal 2009, we completed the sale of the Battery Systems business, which was part of the Electronic Components segment, for net cash proceeds of $14 million after working capital 37 Table of Contents adjustments. The divestiture resulted in a pre-tax loss on sale of $7 million. A pre-tax impairment charge of $22 million was recorded in fiscal 2008 to write the carrying value of the assets and liabilities down to fair value. The loss on divestitures and impairment charges are presented in restructuring and other charges, net on the Consolidated Statement of Operations. We have presented the loss on divestitures, related long-lived asset impairments, and the operations of the mechatronics business, Dulmison connectors and fittings product line, and Battery Systems business in continuing operations due to immateriality. See Note 4 to the Consolidated Financial Statements for additional information regarding the divestitures. Discontinued Operations In fiscal 2010, we recorded income from discontinued operations of $44 million primarily in connection with the favorable resolution of certain litigation contingencies related to the Printed Circuit Group business which was sold in fiscal 2007. In May 2009, we completed the sale of the Wireless Systems business for $664 million in net cash proceeds and recognized a pre-tax gain of $59 million on the transaction. In September 2008, we completed the sale of the Radio Frequency Components and Subsystem business for net cash proceeds of $427 million and recorded a $184 million pre-tax gain on the sale. Also, in September 2008, we completed the sale of the Automotive Radar Sensors business for net cash proceeds of $42 million and recorded a $31 million pre-tax gain on the sale. In fiscal 2009, we received additional cash proceeds of $29 million and recognized an additional pre-tax gain on sale of $4 million in connection with the finalization of working capital adjustments related to the sale of the Radio Frequency Components and Subsystem and Automotive Radar Sensors businesses. In fiscal 2008, we completed the sale of the Power Systems business for $102 million in net cash proceeds and recorded a $51 million pre-tax gain on the sale. The Wireless Systems, Radio Frequency Components and Subsystem, Automotive Radar Sensors, Power Systems and Printed Circuit Group businesses met the held for sale and discontinued operations criteria and have been included in discontinued operations in all periods presented in our Consolidated Financial Statements. Prior to reclassification to held for sale and discontinued operations, the Wireless Systems, Radio Frequency Components and Subsystem, and Automotive Radar Sensors businesses were components of the former Wireless Systems segment. The Power Systems and Printed Circuit Group businesses were components of the Other segment, which was subsequently renamed the Subsea Communications segment. See Note 5 to the Consolidated Financial Statements for additional information regarding discontinued operations. Manufacturing Simplification Since our separation, we have been working on the simplification of our global manufacturing footprint, by migrating facilities from higher-cost to lower-cost countries, consolidating within countries, and transferring product lines to lower-cost countries. These initiatives are designed to help us maintain our competitiveness in the industry, improve our operating leverage, and position us for profitability growth in the years ahead. In connection with our manufacturing simplification plan, we expect to incur restructuring charges of approximately $30 million in fiscal 2011. In fiscal 2010, cash spending related to restructuring was $190 million, and we anticipate spending approximately $130 million in fiscal 2011, relating to both manufacturing simplification and prior year business resizing. Annualized cost savings related to the manufacturing simplification plan are expected to be approximately $20 million. These costs exclude potential restructuring costs that may arise from the acquisition of ADC. 38 Table of Contents Correction of Immaterial Errors During the third quarter of fiscal 2010, we identified certain errors in our accounting for income taxes. These errors related to the adoption of the uncertain tax position provisions of ASC 740, Income Taxes , in fiscal 2008 and data utilized in the determination of our income tax provision in fiscal 2005 through fiscal 2009. In connection with the adoption of the uncertain tax position provisions of ASC 740, we failed to reflect, in the calculation of interest and penalties, the impact of the interest component of a prepayment made to the IRS in fiscal 2007. As a result of this error, we overstated deferred tax assets, receivable from Tyco International Ltd. and Covidien plc, noncurrent income taxes payable, and other income by $64 million, $81 million, $182 million, and $81 million, respectively, and understated accumulated earnings by $118 million in fiscal 2008. The impacts to other income and receivable from Tyco International Ltd. and Covidien plc result from the shared nature of the tax liabilities pursuant to the Tax Sharing Agreement entered into upon separation from Tyco International. We also identified errors in certain reports used, in part, to determine our income tax provision. As a result of these errors, we understated income tax expense and overstated deferred tax assets by $9 million, $14 million, $13 million, $12 million, and $9 million in fiscal 2009, 2008, 2007, 2006, and 2005, respectively. We evaluated the effects of these errors individually and in the aggregate and determined that our prior period financial statements are not materially misstated. However, we determined that the cumulative effect of correcting these errors in fiscal 2010 would be material to the fiscal 2010 financial statements. Therefore, we corrected these errors in the affected prior periods and presented the results in this Annual Report. See Note 2 to the Consolidated Financial Statements for additional information regarding the correction of immaterial errors. Non-GAAP Financial Measures Organic net sales growth, which is included in the discussion below, is a non-GAAP financial measure. The difference between reported net sales growth (the most comparable GAAP measure) and organic net sales growth (the non-GAAP measure) consists of the impact from foreign currency exchange rates, acquisitions, and divestitures. Organic net sales growth is a useful measure of the underlying results and trends in our business. It excludes items that are not completely under management's control, such as the impact of changes in foreign currency exchange rates, and items that do not reflect the underlying growth of the company, such as acquisition and divestiture activity. We believe organic net sales growth provides useful information to investors because it reflects the underlying growth from the ongoing activities of our business. Furthermore, it provides investors with a view of our operations from management's perspective. We use organic net sales growth to monitor and evaluate performance, as it is an important measure of the underlying results of our operations. Management uses organic net sales growth together with GAAP measures such as net sales growth and operating income in its decision making processes related to the operations of our reporting segments and our overall company. We believe that investors benefit from having access to the same financial measures that management uses in evaluating operations. The discussion and analysis of organic net sales growth in Results of Operations below utilizes organic net sales growth as management does internally. Because organic net sales growth calculations may vary among other companies, organic net sales growth amounts presented below may not be comparable with similarly titled measures of other companies. Organic net sales growth is a non-GAAP financial measure that is not meant to be considered in isolation or as a substitute for GAAP measures. The primary limitation of this measure is that it excludes items that have an impact on our net sales. This limitation is best addressed by evaluating organic net sales growth in combination with our GAAP net sales. The tables presented in 39 Table of Contents Results of Operations below provide reconciliations of organic net sales growth to net sales growth calculated under GAAP. Results of Operations Consolidated Operations Key business factors that influenced our results of operations for the periods discussed in this report include: Raw material price increases. We purchased approximately 160 million pounds of copper and 200,000 troy ounces of gold in fiscal 2010. During the periods shown, copper and gold prices, as well as the prices of certain other raw materials, have been volatile and current year prices have increased from prior year levels. The following table sets forth the average prices incurred related to copper and gold during the periods presented: Fiscal Measure 2010 2009 2008 Copper Lb. $ 3.15 $ 2.75 $ 3.40 Gold Troy oz. $ 1,114 $ 878 $ 870 In fiscal 2011, we expect to purchase approximately 170 million pounds of copper and 180,000 troy ounces of gold. Foreign exchange. Approximately 57% of our net sales are invoiced in currencies other than the U.S. Dollar. Our results of operations are influenced by changes in foreign currency exchange rates. Increases or decreases in the value of the U.S. Dollar, compared to other currencies, will directly affect our reported results as we translate those currencies into U.S. Dollars at the end of each fiscal period. The percentage of net sales in fiscal 2010 by major currencies invoiced was as follows: U.S. Dollar 43 % Euro 31 Japanese Yen 9 Chinese Renminbi 5 Korean Won 3 Brazilian Real 2 British Pound Sterling 1 All others 6 Total 100 % 40 Table of Contents The following table sets forth certain items from our Consolidated Statements of Operations and the percentage of net sales that such items represent for the periods shown.

Net sales increased $1,814 million, or 17.7%, to $12,070 million in fiscal 2010 from $10,256 million in fiscal 2009. In fiscal 2009, net sales decreased $4,117 million, or 28.6%, to $10,256 million from $14,373 million in fiscal 2008. On an organic basis, net sales increased $1,712 million, or 16.7%, in fiscal 2010. The increase primarily resulted from strong growth in our Electronic Components segment and, to a lesser degree, our Specialty Products segment, partially offset by a decline in our Subsea Communications segment. On an organic basis, net sales decreased $3,542 million, or 24.6%, in fiscal 2009, primarily as a result of declines in our Electronic Components, Specialty Products, and Network Solutions segments. In fiscal 2010, foreign currency exchange rates positively impacted net sales by $188 million, or 1.8%. Foreign currency exchange rates, primarily the Euro, negatively impacted net sales by $474 million, or 3.3%, in fiscal 2009. Price erosion adversely affected net sales by $169 million, $187 million, and $187 million in fiscal 2010, 2009, and 2008, respectively. See further discussion below under Results of Operations by Segment. 41 Table of Contents The following table sets forth the percentage of our total net sales by geographic region: Fiscal 2010 2009 2008 Europe/Middle East/Africa (EMEA) 35 % 34 % 38 % Asia-Pacific 34 29 28 Americas 31 37 34 Total 100 % 100 % 100 % The following table provides an analysis of the change in our net sales compared to the prior fiscal year by geographic region: Fiscal 2010 2009 Change in Net Sales versus Prior Fiscal Year Change in Net Sales versus Prior Fiscal Year Organic (1) Translation (2) Divestitures Total Organic (1) Translation (2) Divestitures Total ($ in millions) EMEA $ 683 19.5 % $ 2 $ (4 ) $ 681 19.3 % $ (1,581 ) (28.6 )% $ (402 ) $ (4 ) $ (1,987 ) (36.0 )% Asia-Pacific 1,029 35.3 133 (29 ) 1,133 38.6 (1,069 ) (26.3 ) (11 ) (44 ) (1,124 ) (27.7 ) Americas (3) 53 (53 ) (892 ) (18.5 ) (61 ) (53 ) (1,006 ) (20.9 ) Total $ 1,712 16.7 % $ 188 $ (86 ) $ 1,814 17.7 % $ (3,542 ) (24.6 )% $ (474 ) $ (101 ) $ (4,117 ) (28.6 )% (1) Represents the change in net sales resulting from volume and price changes, before consideration of acquisitions, divestitures, and the impact of changes in foreign currency exchange rates.

(2) Represents the change in net sales resulting from changes in foreign currency exchange rates. Gross Margin. Gross margin as a percentage of net sales increased to 31.3% in fiscal 2010 as compared to 24.7% in fiscal 2009. The increase was due primarily to higher sales and improved manufacturing productivity, and to a lesser degree, favorable product mix and cost reductions achieved from restructuring actions implemented during fiscal 2009. In fiscal 2009, gross margin as a percentage of net sales decreased to 24.7% from 29.0% in fiscal 2008. The decrease was due to sales declines and unfavorable absorption of manufacturing costs associated with reduced production levels related to lower sales and our efforts to reduce inventory levels, partially offset by cost reductions from restructuring actions. Selling, General, and Administrative Expenses. Selling, general, and administrative expenses as a percentage of net sales were 12.7% and 13.7% in fiscal 2010 and 2009, respectively. Fiscal 2009 results included a net loss of approximately $50 million primarily associated with economic hedges of certain anticipated future transactions and resulting primarily from the devaluation of certain eastern European currencies. Excluding this item, selling, general, and administrative expenses in fiscal 2010 further decreased as a percentage of net sales as compared to fiscal 2009 as a result of increased sales and cost reductions achieved from restructuring actions implemented during fiscal 2009. Selling, general, and administrative expenses as a percentage of net sales increased to 13.7% in fiscal 2009 as compared to 10.9% in fiscal 2008. As discussed above, in fiscal 2009, results included a net loss of approximately $50 million primarily associated with economic hedges of certain anticipated future transactions and resulting primarily from the devaluation of certain eastern European currencies. In fiscal 2008, selling, general, and administrative expenses included a $36 million gain on the sale of real estate related to our Electronic Components segment. Excluding these items, selling, general, and administrative expenses increased as a percentage of net sales in fiscal 2009 from fiscal 2008 due to the decrease in sales volume. Research, Development, and Engineering Expenses. Research, development, and engineering expenses as a percentage of net sales decreased to 4.8% in fiscal 2010 from 5.2% in fiscal 2009. The decrease as a percentage of net sales was attributable to higher net sales partially offset by increased investment in research and development across our businesses during fiscal 2010. Research, development, and engineering expenses as a percentage of net sales increased to 5.2% in fiscal 2009 as compared to 4.1% in fiscal 2008. The increase as a percentage of net sales was due to decreases in sales volume as well as our continued focus on future technologies within all four of our operating segments in fiscal 2009. 43 Table of Contents Restructuring and Other Charges, Net. In fiscal 2010, net restructuring and other charges were $137 million as compared to $375 million in fiscal 2009 and $219 million in fiscal 2008. Total charges, including amounts reflected in cost of sales, were $134 million, $373 million, and $228 million in fiscal 2010, 2009, and 2008, respectively. Fiscal 2010 restructuring actions primarily related to headcount reductions in the Electronic Components segment. Fiscal 2010 charges included a pre-tax loss on sale of $41 million related to the sale of our mechatronics business which was part of our Electronic Components segment as well as long-lived asset impairment charges of $12 million and a loss on sale of $1 million related to the divestiture of the Dulmison connectors and fittings product line which was part of the energy business in our Network Solutions segment. Fiscal 2009 restructuring actions reduced costs in response to market conditions and primarily related to headcount reductions and manufacturing site closures in the Electronic Components, Network Solutions, and Specialty Products segments. Fiscal 2009 charges included a long-lived asset impairment of $14 million in our Network Solutions segment primarily related to the divestiture of the Dulmison connectors and fittings product line and a loss on sale of $7 million related to the sale of the Battery Systems business which was part of the Electronic Components segment. Fiscal 2008 restructuring actions related to the migration of product lines to lower-cost countries and the exit of certain manufacturing operations in the Electronic Components and Network Solutions segments. Fiscal 2008 charges included long-lived asset impairments in our Electronic Components segment of $34 million, consisting of $22 million related to the divestiture of the Battery Systems business and $12 million related to certain dedicated manufacturing lines serving the North American automotive market. See Note 4 to the Consolidated Financial Statements for additional information regarding net restructuring and other charges. Pre-separation Litigation Charges (Income), Net. During fiscal 2010, Tyco International settled the remaining securities lawsuit, a class action captioned Stumpf v. Tyco International Ltd., et al. , for $79 million. Pursuant to the sharing formula in the Separation and Distribution Agreement, our share of the settlement amount was $24 million. As discussed below, we had previously established reserves for this case. As a result of the settlement of the Stumpf case, we concluded that reserves of $22 million could be released. Accordingly, pursuant to the sharing formula, we recorded income of $7 million during fiscal 2010. As of September 24, 2010, there were no remaining significant securities lawsuits outstanding. During fiscal 2009, we recorded charges of $144 million for our share of Tyco International's settlements of several securities cases and our portion of the estimated probable loss for the then remaining securities litigation claims, including the Stumpf case, subject to the Separation and Distribution Agreement. During fiscal 2008, we recorded charges of $34 million for our share of Tyco International's settlements of two securities cases and income of $12 million for our portion of related recoveries of certain costs from insurers. See "Part I. Item 3. Legal Proceedings" and Note 14 to the Consolidated Financial Statements for additional information regarding pre-separation securities litigation. Impairment of Goodwill. During fiscal 2009, we recorded a goodwill impairment charge of $3,435 million in our Electronic Components segment, of which $2,088 million and $1,347 million related to the Automotive and Communications and Industrial Solutions reporting units, respectively.

New Segment Structure for Fiscal 2011 Effective for the first quarter of fiscal 2011, we reorganized our management and our segments to further align the organization around our strategy. Our businesses in the Specialty Products Group Aerospace, Defense, and Marine; Medical Products; Circuit Protection; and Touch Systems have been moved into other segments. Also, the Subsea Communications segment has been included within the Network Solutions segment. The following represents the new segment structure: Transportation Connectivity. This segment consists of our Automotive and Aerospace, Defense, and Marine businesses. Communications and Industrial Solutions. This segment contains our DataComm, Industrial Products, Consumer Devices, Lighting, Alternative Energy, Medical Products, Circuit Protection, and Touch Systems businesses. Network Solutions. The Subsea Communications, Telecom Service Providers, Enterprise Networks, and Energy businesses are included in this segment. Also, when the ADC acquisition is complete, it will be integrated into this segment. In this Annual Report, results for fiscal 2010 and prior periods are reported on the basis under which we managed our business in fiscal 2010 and do not reflect the fiscal 2011 segment reorganization. Non-Operating Items Interest Expense, Net Net interest expense was $135 million, $148 million, and $158 million in fiscal 2010, 2009, and 2008, respectively. The decrease of $13 million, or 8.8%, in fiscal 2010 from fiscal 2009 was due to lower average debt levels resulting in lower interest expense. The decrease of $10 million, or 6.3%, in fiscal 2009 from fiscal 2008 was driven by lower average debt levels partially offset by lower interest income. Other Income (Expense), Net In fiscal 2010, we recorded net other income of $177 million, primarily consisting of income pursuant to the Tax Sharing Agreement with Tyco International and Covidien. The income in fiscal 2010 reflects a net increase to the receivable from Tyco International and Covidien primarily related to certain proposed adjustments to prior period income tax returns and related accrued interest, partially offset by a decrease related to the completion of certain non-U.S. audits of prior year income tax returns. See Note 14 to the Consolidated Financial Statements for further information regarding the Tax Sharing Agreement. In fiscal 2009, we recorded net other expense of $48 million, consisting of $68 million of expense pursuant to the Tax Sharing Agreement with Tyco International and Covidien, a $22 million gain on the 52 Table of Contents retirement of debt, and $2 million of unrealized losses on rabbi trust assets. The $68 million of expense is attributable to a net reduction of an indemnification asset primarily as a result of the settlement of various matters with the IRS. See Note 12 to the Consolidated Financial Statements for additional information regarding the gain on retirement of debt. In fiscal 2008, we recorded other income of $486 million, pursuant to the Tax Sharing Agreement with Tyco International and Covidien, of which $464 million related to certain incremental tax liabilities recorded in connection with the adoption of the uncertain tax position provisions of ASC 740, Income Taxes . See Note 18 to the Consolidated Financial Statements for additional information regarding the adoption of the uncertain tax position provisions of ASC 740. Income Taxes Our operations are conducted through our various subsidiaries in a number of countries throughout the world. We have provided for income taxes based upon the tax laws and rates in the countries in which our operations are conducted and income and loss from operations is subject to taxation. In fiscal 2009, we changed our place of incorporation from Bermuda to Switzerland. We do not expect the change to materially impact our tax provision or cash tax burden. Our effective income tax rate was 31.6% for fiscal 2010 and reflects a charge of $307 million primarily associated with certain proposed adjustments to prior year income tax returns and related accrued interest partially offset by an income tax benefit of $101 million recognized in connection with the completion of certain non-U.S. audits of prior year income tax returns. In addition, the effective income tax rate for fiscal 2010 reflects an income tax benefit of $72 million recognized in connection with a reduction in the valuation allowance associated with tax loss carryforwards in certain non-U.S. locations. Our effective income tax rate was 15.4% for fiscal 2009 and includes the effects of the $3,547 million pre-tax impairment of goodwill for which a partial tax benefit of $523 million was recorded, a $144 million pre-tax charge related to pre-separation securities litigation for which a partial tax benefit of $25 million was recorded, a $28 million charge related to the settlement of a tax matter, and a $24 million detriment related to a $68 million pre-tax expense recognized pursuant to our Tax Sharing Agreement with Tyco International and Covidien. Additionally, the effective income tax rate for fiscal 2009 reflects adjustments related to prior years tax returns, including a $49 million tax benefit. Our effective income tax rate was 27.8% for fiscal 2008 and includes a benefit of $170 million primarily related to the pre-tax income pursuant to the Tax Sharing Agreement with Tyco International and Covidien of $464 million recognized in connection with our adoption of the uncertain tax position provisions of ASC 740, for which no tax was provided. The effective income tax rate was also impacted by increased accruals in fiscal 2008 of interest related to uncertain tax positions partially offset by a $42 million benefit associated with a favorable settlement with a taxing authority for certain pre-separation tax issues. In addition, the effective income tax rate for fiscal 2008 reflects the benefits of increased profitability in operations in lower tax rate jurisdictions, a $33 million benefit related to adjustments to tax account balances, a $25 million increase in the valuation allowance related to restructuring charges, and a $22 million tax detriment recorded in connection with the goodwill impairment charge for which a tax benefit was not fully realized. The valuation allowance for deferred tax assets of $2,236 million and $2,487 million at fiscal year end 2010 and 2009, respectively, relates principally to the uncertainty of the utilization of certain deferred tax assets, primarily tax loss, capital loss, and credit carryforwards in various jurisdictions. We believe that we will generate sufficient future taxable income to realize the tax benefits related to the remaining net deferred tax assets on our Consolidated Balance Sheet. The valuation allowance was calculated in accordance with the provisions of ASC 740 which require that a valuation allowance be 53 Table of Contents established or maintained when it is more likely than not that all or a portion of deferred tax assets will not be realized. The calculation of our tax liabilities includes estimates for uncertainties in the application of complex tax regulations across multiple global jurisdictions where we conduct our operations. Under the uncertain tax position provisions of ASC 740, we recognize liabilities for tax as well as related interest for issues in the U.S. and other tax jurisdictions based on our estimate of whether, and the extent to which, additional taxes and related interest will be due. These tax liabilities and related interest are reflected net of the impact of related tax loss carryforwards as such tax loss carryforwards will be applied against these tax liabilities and will reduce the amount of cash tax payments due upon the eventual settlement with the tax authorities. These estimates may change due to changing facts and circumstances; however, due to the complexity of these uncertainties, the ultimate resolution may result in a settlement that differs from our current estimate of the tax liabilities and related interest. Further, management has reviewed with tax counsel the issues raised by certain taxing authorities and the adequacy of these recorded amounts. If our current estimate of tax and interest liabilities is less than the ultimate settlement, an additional charge to income tax expense may result. If our current estimate of tax and interest liabilities is more than the ultimate settlement, income tax benefits may be recognized. We have provided income taxes for earnings that are currently distributed as well as the taxes associated with several subsidiaries' earnings that are expected to be distributed in fiscal 2011. No additional provision has been made for U.S. or non-U.S. income taxes on the undistributed earnings of subsidiaries or for unrecognized deferred tax liabilities for temporary differences related to basis differences in investments in subsidiaries, as such earnings are expected to be permanently reinvested, the investments are essentially permanent in duration, or we have concluded that no additional tax liability will arise as a result of the distribution of such earnings. As of September 24, 2010, certain subsidiaries had approximately $14 billion of undistributed earnings that we intend to permanently reinvest. A liability could arise if our intentions to permanently reinvest such earnings were to change and amounts are distributed by such subsidiaries or if such subsidiaries are ultimately disposed. It is not practicable to estimate the additional income taxes related to permanently reinvested earnings or the basis differences related to investments in subsidiaries. Income (Loss) from Discontinued Operations, Net of Income Taxes Income from discontinued operations was $44 million in fiscal 2010 compared to losses from discontinued operations of $156 million in fiscal 2009. Income from discontinued operations was $255 million in fiscal 2008. In fiscal 2010, we recorded income from discontinued operations of $44 million primarily in connection with the favorable resolution of certain litigation contingencies related to the Printed Circuit Group business which was sold in fiscal 2007. In May 2009, we completed the sale of the Wireless Systems business for $664 million in net cash proceeds and recognized a pre-tax gain of $59 million on the transaction. Also, in fiscal 2009, we recognized an additional pre-tax gain on sale of $4 million in connection with the finalization of working capital adjustments related to the sale of the Radio Frequency Components and Subsystem and Automotive Radar Sensors businesses. Pre-tax loss from discontinued operations for fiscal 2009 included pre-tax charges of $111 million related to the Wireless Systems business's contract with the State of New York. See Note 14 to the Consolidated Financial Statements for additional information regarding the State of New York contract. Income tax expense on discontinued operations for fiscal 2009 included $68 million relating to the impact of $319 million of goodwill written off in connection with the divestiture of the Wireless Systems business, for which a tax benefit was not fully realized, as well as $35 million of unfavorable 54 Table of Contents adjustments to the estimated tax provision on the Power Systems business as a result of the finalization of the tax basis of assets sold upon the filing of the fiscal 2008 income tax returns. In September 2008, we completed the sale of the Radio Frequency Components and Subsystem business for net cash proceeds of $427 million and recorded a $184 million pre-tax gain on the sale. In September 2008, we also completed the sale of the Automotive Radar Sensors business for net cash proceeds of $42 million and recorded a $31 million pre-tax gain on the sale. Also, in fiscal 2008, we completed the sale of our Power Systems business for $102 million in net cash proceeds and recorded a $51 million pre-tax gain on the sale. See Note 5 to the Consolidated Financial Statements for additional information regarding discontinued operations. Liquidity and Capital Resources The following table summarizes our cash flows from operating, investing, and financing activities, as reflected on the Consolidated Statements of Cash Flows, for fiscal 2010, 2009, and 2008: Fiscal 2010 2009 2008 (in millions) Net cash provided by operating activities $ 1,679 $ 1,329 $ 989 Net cash provided by (used in) investing activities (442 ) 391 895 Net cash used in financing activities (779 ) (1,254 ) (1,739 ) Effect of currency translation on cash 11 (31 ) 1 Net increase in cash and cash equivalents $ 469 $ 435 $ 146 Our ability to fund our future capital needs will be affected by our ability to continue to generate cash from operations and may be affected by our ability to access the capital markets, money markets, or other sources of funding, as well as the capacity and terms of our financing arrangements. We believe that cash generated from operations and, to the extent necessary, these other sources of potential funding will be sufficient to meet our anticipated capital needs for the foreseeable future. We may use excess cash to reduce our outstanding debt levels, including through the possible repurchase of our public debt in accordance with applicable law, to purchase a portion of our common shares pursuant to our authorized share repurchase program, to pay distributions or dividends on our common shares, or to acquire strategic businesses or product lines. We intend to fund the acquisition of ADC with approximately $1 billion of available cash and the remainder with funds available under our existing Credit Facility or alternative borrowing sources, including the issuance of new notes or commercial paper. The cost or availability of future funding may be impacted by financial market conditions. We will continue to monitor financial markets, to respond as necessary to changing conditions. 55 Table of Contents Cash Flows from Operating Activities The following table summarizes the sources and uses of our cash flows from operating activities for fiscal 2010, 2009, and 2008: Fiscal 2010 2009 2008 (in millions) Operating income (loss) $ 1,516 $ (3,474 ) $ 1,663 Impairment of goodwill 3,547 103 Class action settlement (936 ) Loss on divestitures 43 7 Non-cash restructuring and other charges, net 17 49 81 Depreciation and amortization 520 515 539 Deferred income taxes 35 (574 ) 178 Provisions for losses on accounts receivable and inventories (4 ) 74 42 Share-based compensation 63 50 55 Other, net 26 10 (18 ) Changes in assets and liabilities, net: Accounts receivable, net (323 ) 651 (107 ) Inventories (213 ) 638 (221 ) Accounts payable 317 (420 ) 41 Other 310 (114 ) 214 Interest income 20 17 32 Interest expense (155 ) (165 ) (190 ) Income tax (expense) benefit (493 ) 567 (554 ) Net cash provided by continuing operating activities 1,679 1,378 922 Net cash provided by (used in) discontinued operating activities (49 ) 67 Net cash provided by operating activities $ 1,679 $ 1,329 $ 989 Net cash provided by continuing operating activities was $1,679 million in fiscal 2010 as compared to $1,378 million in fiscal 2009. The increase of $301 million in fiscal 2010 over fiscal 2009 primarily resulted from higher income levels, partially offset by increased working capital to support current business levels. Net cash provided by continuing operating activities increased $456 million to $1,378 million in fiscal 2009 from $922 million in fiscal 2008. The finalization of a class action settlement in February 2008 resulted in a decrease to cash flows from operating activities and an increase to cash flows from investing activities of $936 million. Excluding the class action settlement, net cash provided by continuing operating activities was lower in fiscal 2009 as compared to fiscal 2008 primarily due to lower income levels partially offset by working capital improvements. 56 Table of Contents Pension and postretirement benefit contributions in fiscal 2010, 2009, and 2008, were $180 million, $145 million, and $77 million, respectively. These amounts included voluntary pension contributions of $69 million and $61 million in fiscal 2010 and 2009, respectively. We expect pension contributions to be $70 million in fiscal 2011, before consideration of voluntary contributions. The amount of income taxes paid, net of refunds, during fiscal 2010, 2009, and 2008, was $156 million, $121 million, and $359 million, respectively. Cash Flows from Investing Activities The following table summarizes the sources and uses of our cash flows from investing activities for fiscal 2010, 2009, and 2008: Fiscal 2010 2009 2008 (in millions) Capital expenditures $ (385 ) $ (328 ) $ (610 ) Proceeds from sale of property, plant, and equipment 16 13 42 Acquisition of businesses, net of cash acquired (93 ) (3 ) Proceeds from divestiture of discontinued operations, net of cash retained by operations sold 693 571 Proceeds from divestiture of businesses, net of cash retained by businesses sold 15 17 Class action settlement escrow 936 Other 5 (1 ) (26 ) Net cash provided by (used in) continuing investing activities (442 ) 394 910 Net cash used in discontinued investing activities (3 ) (15 ) Net cash provided by (used in) investing activities $ (442 ) $ 391 $ 895 We continue to fund capital expenditures to support new programs and to invest in machinery and our manufacturing facilities to further enhance productivity and manufacturing capabilities. Capital spending increased $57 million in fiscal 2010 to $385 million as compared to $328 million in fiscal 2009. Capital spending was $610 million in fiscal 2008. We expect fiscal 2011 capital spending levels to be approximately 4 to 5% of net sales. During fiscal 2010, we acquired the remaining outstanding equity interests of PlanarMag for $23 million in cash and the forgiveness of an approximate $1 million loan payable. Also, we acquired certain assets of the Optical Products Group of Zarlink for $15 million in cash. In addition, we acquired Sensitive Object for a purchase price of $67 million, which includes $6 million of contingent consideration to be paid in fiscal 2011. During fiscal 2010, we received net cash proceeds of $3 million and $12 million related to the sale of the mechatronics business and the Dulmison connectors and fittings product line, respectively. In fiscal 2009, we received net cash proceeds of $664 million related to the sale of our Wireless Systems business. Also, in fiscal 2009, we received additional cash proceeds related to working capital of $29 million in connection with the sale of the Radio Frequency Components and Subsystems and Automotive Radar Sensors businesses which occurred in fiscal 2008 and $17 million primarily related to the divestiture of the Battery Systems business. In fiscal 2008, we received net cash proceeds of $102 million, $427 million, and $42 million related to the sale of the Power Systems, Radio Frequency Components and Subsystem, and Automotive Radar Sensors businesses, respectively. 57 Table of Contents The finalization of a class action settlement in fiscal 2008 resulted in an increase to cash flows from investing activities of $936 million, but did not affect the cash balance on the Consolidated Balance Sheet. Cash Flows from Financing Activities and Capitalization The following table summarizes the sources and uses of our cash flows from financing activities for fiscal 2010, 2009, and 2008: Fiscal 2010 2009 2008 (in millions) Net increase (decrease) in commercial paper $ 100 $ (649 ) $ 630 Proceeds from long-term debt 448 900 Repayment of long-term debt (100 ) (602 ) (1,751 ) Repurchase of common shares (488 ) (152 ) (1,242 ) Payment of common share dividends and cash distributions to shareholders (289 ) (294 ) (271 ) Other (2 ) (61 ) 47 Net cash used in continuing financing activities (779 ) (1,310 ) (1,687 ) Net cash provided by (used in) discontinued financing activities 56 (52 ) Net cash used in financing activities $ (779 ) $ (1,254 ) $ (1,739 ) Total debt at fiscal year end 2010 and 2009 was $2,413 million and $2,417 million, respectively. See Note 12 to the Consolidated Financial Statements for additional information regarding debt. During June 2009, Tyco Electronics Group S.A. ("TEGSA"), our wholly-owned subsidiary, commenced a tender offer to purchase up to $150 million principal amount of its 6.00% senior notes due 2012, up to $100 million principal amount of its 6.55% senior notes due 2017, and up to $100 million principal amount of its 7.125% senior notes due 2037. On July 7, 2009, the tender offer expired and on July 9, 2009, TEGSA purchased and cancelled $86 million principal amount of its 6.00% senior notes due 2012, $42 million principal amount of its 6.55% senior notes due 2017, and $23 million principal amount of its 7.125% senior notes due 2037 for an aggregate payment of $141 million, plus paid accrued interest through July 7, 2009 of $3 million to the sellers of the notes. As a result of the transaction, in fiscal 2009, we recorded a pre-tax gain of $22 million, which is included in other income, including the write-off of unamortized discounts and fees of $1 million and the recognition of a gain of $12 million associated with terminated interest rate swaps previously designated as fair value hedges. Additionally, as a result of the re-purchase and cancellation, unamortized losses in accumulated other comprehensive income of $3 million related to terminated starting forward interest rate swaps designated as cash flow hedges were recognized as interest expense. In April 2007, TEGSA entered into a five-year unsecured senior revolving credit facility ("Credit Facility"). In fiscal 2009, $75 million of the commitment was assigned by Lehman Brothers Bank, FSB to TEGSA, reducing the total effective commitment to $1,425 million. Borrowings under the Credit Facility bear interest, at TEGSA's option, at a base rate or the London interbank offered rate plus a margin dependent on TEGSA's credit ratings and the amount drawn under the facility. TEGSA is required to pay an annual facility fee ranging from 4.5 to 12.5 basis points depending on its credit ratings. As of fiscal year end 2010 and 2009, TEGSA had no borrowings under the Credit Facility. Our Credit Facility contains a financial ratio covenant providing that if our ratio of Consolidated Total Debt (as defined in the Credit Facility) to Consolidated EBITDA (as defined in the Credit Facility) for the then most recently concluded period of four consecutive fiscal quarters exceeds 3.5 to 1.0, an Event of Default (as defined in the Credit Facility) is triggered under the Credit Facility. The 58 Table of Contents Credit Facility and our other debt agreements contain other customary covenants. None of our covenants are presently considered restrictive to our operations. As of September 24, 2010, we were in compliance with all of our debt covenants and believe that we will continue to be in compliance with our existing covenants for the foreseeable future. Periodically, TEGSA issues commercial paper to U.S. institutional accredited investors and qualified institutional buyers in accordance with available exemptions from the registration requirements of the Securities Act of 1933 as part of our ongoing effort to maintain financial flexibility and to potentially decrease the cost of borrowings. Borrowings under the commercial paper program are backed by the Credit Facility. As of fiscal year end 2010, TEGSA had $100 million of commercial paper outstanding at an interest rate of 0.55%. TEGSA's payment obligations under its senior notes, commercial paper, and Credit Facility are fully and unconditionally guaranteed by Tyco Electronics Ltd. Payments of common share dividends and cash distributions to shareholders were $289 million, $294 million, and $271 million in fiscal 2010, 2009, and 2008, respectively. In October 2009, our shareholders approved a cash distribution to shareholders in the form of a capital reduction to the par value of our common shares of CHF 0.34 (equivalent to $0.32) per share, payable in two equal installments in each of the first and second quarters of fiscal 2010. We paid the first and second installments of the distribution at a rate of $0.16 per share each during the quarters ended December 25, 2009 and March 26, 2010. These capital reductions reduced the par value of our common shares from CHF 2.43 (equivalent to $2.24) to CHF 2.09 (equivalent to $1.92). In March 2010, our shareholders approved a cash distribution to shareholders in the form of a capital reduction to the par value of our common shares of CHF 0.72 (equivalent to $0.64) per share, payable in four equal installments in each quarter beginning in the third quarter of fiscal 2010 through the second quarter of fiscal 2011. We paid the first and second installments of the distribution at a rate of $0.16 per share each during the quarters ended June 25, 2010 and September 24, 2010. These capital reductions reduced the par value of our common shares from CHF 2.09 (equivalent to $1.92) to CHF 1.73 (equivalent to $1.60). The remaining distributions will be paid in U.S. Dollars at a rate of $0.16 per share for each of the first and second quarters of fiscal 2011. Future distributions or dividends on our common shares, if any, must be approved by our shareholders. In exercising their discretion to recommend to the shareholders that such distributions or dividends be approved, our board of directors will consider our results of operations, cash requirements and surplus, financial condition, statutory requirements of applicable law, contractual restrictions, and other factors that they may deem relevant. Our board of directors has approved a recommendation that our shareholders be asked to approve, at the 2011 annual general meeting of shareholders expected to be held in March 2011, a dividend to shareholders to be paid in four equal installments each at a rate of $0.18 per share in each quarter beginning in the third quarter of fiscal 2011 through the second quarter of fiscal 2012. Such proposed quarterly dividends will not be finalized unless and until approved by our shareholders. During fiscal 2010, we purchased approximately 18 million of our common shares for $488 million. In fiscal 2009, we purchased approximately 6 million of our common shares for $125 million and also settled purchases of $27 million of our common shares which occurred prior to the end of fiscal 2008. In fiscal 2008, we purchased approximately 37 million of our common shares for $1,269 million, of which $1,242 million was paid as of September 26, 2008. Since inception of the share repurchase program, which had an authorization of $2.0 billion at September 24, 2010, we have purchased approximately 61 million shares for $1,882 million. On September 29, 2010, our board of directors authorized an increase in the share repurchase program from $2.0 billion to $2.75 billion. 59 Table of Contents Commitments and Contingencies The following table provides a summary of our contractual obligations and commitments for debt, minimum lease payment obligations under non-cancelable leases, and other obligations at fiscal year end 2010. Payments due by fiscal year Total 2011 2012 2013 2014 2015 There- after (in millions) Long-term debt, including current portion $ 2,413 $ 106 $ 1 $ 791 $ 300 $ $ 1,215 Interest on long-term debt (1) 1,464 145 145 123 91 80 880 Operating leases 427 109 84 62 51 37 84 Purchase obligations (2) 101 100 1 Total contractual cash obligations (3)(4)(5) $ 4,405 $ 460 $ 231 $ 976 $ 442 $ 117 $ 2,179 (1) Interest payments exclude the impact of our interest rate swaps. (2) Purchase obligations consist of commitments for purchases of goods and services. (3) The table above does not reflect unrecognized tax benefits of $1,689 million and related accrued interest and penalties of $1,252 million, the timing of which is uncertain. See Note 18 to the Consolidated Financial Statements for additional information regarding unrecognized tax benefits, interest, and penalties. (4) The table above does not reflect pension and postretirement benefit obligations to certain employees and former employees. We are obligated to make contributions to our pension plans and postretirement benefit plans; however, we are unable to determine the amount of plan contributions due to the inherent uncertainties of obligations of this type, including timing, interest rate charges, investment performance, and amounts of benefit payments. We expect to contribute $70 million to pension and postretirement benefit plans in fiscal 2011, before consideration of voluntary contributions. These plans and our estimates of future contributions and benefit payments are more fully described in Note 17 to the Consolidated Financial Statements. (5) Other long-term liabilities of $452 million, of which $205 million related to our ASC 460 liability, are excluded from the table above as we are unable to estimate the timing of payment for these items. See Note 13 to the Consolidated Financial Statements for more information regarding ASC 460. Income Tax Matters In connection with the separation, we entered into a Tax Sharing Agreement that generally governs Covidien's, Tyco Electronics', and Tyco International's respective rights, responsibilities, and obligations after the distribution with respect to taxes, including ordinary course of business taxes and taxes, if any, incurred as a result of any failure of the distribution of all of the shares of Covidien or Tyco Electronics to qualify as a tax-free distribution for U.S. federal income tax purposes within the meaning of Section 355 of the Code or certain internal transactions undertaken in anticipation of the spin-offs to qualify for tax-favored treatment under the Code. Pursuant to the Separation and Distribution Agreement and Tax Sharing Agreement, upon separation, we entered into certain guarantee commitments and indemnifications with Tyco International and Covidien. Under these agreements, principally the Tax Sharing Agreement, Tyco International, Covidien, and Tyco Electronics share 27%, 42%, and 31%, respectively, of certain contingent liabilities relating to unresolved pre-separation tax matters of Tyco International. The effect of the Tax Sharing Agreement is to indemnify us for 69% of certain liabilities settled in cash by Tyco Electronics with respect to unresolved pre-separation tax matters. Pursuant to that indemnification, we have made similar indemnifications to Tyco International and Covidien with respect to 31% of certain liabilities settled in cash by the companies relating to unresolved pre-separation tax matters. If any of the companies responsible for all or a portion of such liabilities were to default in its payment of costs or expenses related to any such liability, we would be responsible for a portion of the defaulting party 60 Table of Contents or parties' obligation. We are responsible for all of our own taxes that are not shared pursuant to the Tax Sharing Agreement's sharing formula. In addition, Tyco International and Covidien are responsible for their tax liabilities that are not subject to the Tax Sharing Agreement's sharing formula. Prior to separation, certain of our subsidiaries filed combined tax returns with Tyco International. Those and other of our subsidiaries' income tax returns are periodically examined by various tax authorities. In connection with these examinations, tax authorities, including the IRS, have raised issues and proposed tax adjustments. Tyco International, as the U.S. income tax audit controlling party under the Tax Sharing Agreement, is reviewing and contesting certain of the proposed tax adjustments. Amounts related to these tax adjustments and other tax contingencies and related interest that management has assessed under the uncertain tax position provisions of ASC 740, which relate specifically to Tyco Electronics entities, have been recorded on the Consolidated Financial Statements. In addition, we may be required to fund portions of Covidien and Tyco International's tax obligations. Estimates about these guarantees have also been recognized on the Consolidated Financial Statements. See Note 13 to the Consolidated Financial Statements for additional information. In prior years, in connection with the IRS audit of various fiscal years, Tyco International submitted to the IRS proposed adjustments to these prior period U.S. federal income tax returns resulting in a reduction in the taxable income previously filed. The IRS accepted substantially all of the proposed adjustments for fiscal 1997 through 2000 for which the IRS had completed its field work. On the basis of previously accepted amendments, we have determined that acceptance of adjustments presented for additional periods through fiscal 2006 is more likely than not to be accepted and, accordingly, have recorded them, as well as the impacts of the adjustments accepted by the IRS, on the Consolidated Financial Statements. In fiscal 2009, certain proposed adjustments to U.S. federal income tax returns were completed by Tyco International and in connection with these adjustments, we recorded a $97 million increase in income tax liabilities, a $10 million increase in deferred tax assets, a $60 million increase in the receivable from Tyco International and Covidien in connection with the Tax Sharing Agreement, and a $27 million charge to contributed surplus. See Note 13 to the Consolidated Financial Statements for additional information regarding the indemnification liability to Tyco International and Covidien. As our tax return positions continue to be updated for periods prior to separation, additional adjustments may be identified and recorded on the Consolidated Financial Statements. While the final adjustments cannot be determined until the income tax return amendment process is completed, we believe that any resulting adjustments will not have a material impact on our results of operations, financial position, or cash flows. Additionally, adjustments may be recorded to shareholders' equity in the future for the impact of filing final or amended income tax returns in certain jurisdictions where those returns include a combination of Tyco International, Covidien, and/or our subsidiaries for the periods prior to the separation. During fiscal 2007, the IRS concluded its field examination of certain of Tyco International's U.S. federal income tax returns for the years 1997 through 2000 and issued Revenue Agent Reports which reflect the IRS' determination of proposed tax adjustments for the 1997 through 2000 period. Tyco International has appealed certain proposed adjustments totaling approximately $1 billion. Additionally, the IRS proposed civil fraud penalties against Tyco International arising from alleged actions of former executives in connection with certain intercompany transfers of stock in 1998 and 1999. Based upon statutory guidelines, Tyco International estimates the proposed penalties could range between $30 million and $50 million, and it is our understanding that Tyco International is vigorously opposing the assertion of any such penalties. The penalty is asserted against a prior subsidiary of Tyco International that was distributed to Tyco Electronics in connection with the separation. Any penalty ultimately imposed upon the Tyco Electronics subsidiary would be subject to sharing with Tyco International and Covidien under the Tax Sharing Agreement. It is our understanding that Tyco 61 Table of Contents International has made progress during fiscal 2010 towards resolving a substantial number of the proposed tax adjustments for the years 1997 through 2000; however, several significant matters remain in dispute. The primary issues in dispute involve the tax treatment of certain intercompany transactions. If Tyco International is not able to resolve these contested adjustments through the IRS appeals process, it may choose to litigate the disputed issues. In addition, Tyco International could settle with the IRS and pay any related deficiencies for the undisputed tax adjustments within the next twelve months. The IRS continues to audit certain Tyco International income tax returns for the years 2001 through 2004 and is nearing completion of its fieldwork for this period. It is possible that the audit for the years 2001 through 2004 will conclude within the next twelve months. During the fourth quarter of fiscal 2009, Tyco International settled a matter with the IRS concerning certain tax deductions claimed on Tyco International's income tax returns for the years 2001 through 2004. As a result of this settlement, we recorded a $28 million income tax charge in the fourth quarter of fiscal 2009 to reflect the disallowance of a portion of these deductions. We have reflected $244 million of liabilities related to the audits of Tyco International's income tax returns for 1997 through 2000 and 2001 through 2004 in accrued and other current liabilities as certain of these matters could be resolved within one year. It is anticipated that the IRS will commence its audit of certain Tyco International income tax returns for the years 2005 through 2007 in fiscal 2011. We continue to believe that the amounts recorded on our Consolidated Financial Statements relating to the matters discussed above are appropriate. However, the ultimate resolution is uncertain and could result in a material impact to our results of operations, financial position, or cash flows. Legal Matters In the ordinary course of business, we are subject to various legal proceedings and claims, including patent infringement claims, antitrust claims, product liability matters, environmental matters, employment disputes, disputes on agreements, and other commercial disputes. Management believes that these legal proceedings and claims likely will be resolved over an extended period of time. Although it is not feasible to predict the outcome of these proceedings, based upon our experience, current information, and applicable law, we do not expect that these proceedings will have a material adverse effect on our results of operations, financial position, or cash flows. However, one or more of the proceedings could have a material adverse effect on our results of operations, financial position, or cash flows in a future period. See "Part I. Item 3. Legal Proceedings" and Note 14 to the Consolidated Financial Statements for further information regarding legal proceedings. Matters Related to Our Former Wireless Systems Business Certain liabilities and contingencies related to our former Wireless Systems business were retained by us when this business was sold in fiscal 2009. These include certain retained liabilities related to the State of New York contract and a contingent purchase price commitment related to the acquisition of Com-Net by the Wireless Systems business in 2001. See additional information below. Also, see Note 5 to the Consolidated Financial Statements for additional information regarding the divestiture of the Wireless Systems business. 62 Table of Contents State of New York Contract On September 19, 2005, our former Wireless Systems business was awarded a twenty-year lease contract with the State of New York to construct, operate, and maintain a statewide wireless communications network for use by state and municipal first responders. On August 29, 2008, we were served by the State with a default notice related to the first regional network, pursuant to the contract. Under the terms of the contract, we had 45 days to rectify the purported deficiencies noted by the State. On October 16, 2008, we informed the State that all technical deficiencies had been remediated and the system was operating in accordance with the contract specifications and certified the system ready for testing. The State conducted further testing during November and December 2008. On January 15, 2009, the State notified us that, in the State's opinion, we had not fully remediated the issues cited by the State and it had determined that we were in default of the contract and that it had exercised its right to terminate the contract. The State contends that it has the right under the contract to recoup costs incurred by the State in conjunction with the implementation of the network, and as a result of this contention, on January 16, 2009, the State drew down $50 million against an irrevocable standby letter of credit funded by us. The State has the ability to draw up to an additional $50 million against the standby letter of credit, although we dispute that the State has any basis to do so. On February 13, 2009, we filed a claim in the New York Court of Claims, seeking over $100 million in damages, and alleging a number of causes of action, including breach of contract, unjust enrichment, defamation, conversion, breach of the covenant of good faith and fair dealing, the imposition of a constructive trust, and seeking a declaration that the State terminated the contract "for convenience." In September 2009, the Court granted the State's motion to dismiss all counts of the complaint, with the exception of the breach of contract claims. In November 2009, the State filed an answer to the complaint and counterclaim asserting breach of contract and alleging that the State has incurred damages in excess of $275 million. We moved to dismiss the counterclaim in February 2010, and in June 2010 the Court denied our motion. We filed our answer to the State's counterclaim in July 2010. We believe that the counterclaim is without merit and intend to vigorously pursue our claims in this matter. As a result of these actions, in the first quarter of fiscal 2009, we recorded pre-tax charges totaling $111 million associated with this contract. These charges are reflected in loss from discontinued operations on the Consolidated Statement of Operations as a result of our sale of the Wireless Systems business. See Note 5 to the Consolidated Financial Statements for further discussion of discontinued operations and the sale of the Wireless Systems business. The charges included an impairment charge of $61 million to write-off all costs incurred in constructing the network as well as a charge equal to the amount drawn by the State against the standby letter of credit of $50 million. The assets related to the impairment charge were previously reflected primarily as inventories on the Consolidated Balance Sheet. Com-Net At September 24, 2010, we had a contingent purchase price commitment of $80 million related to our fiscal 2001 acquisition of Com-Net. This represents the maximum amount payable to the former shareholders of Com-Net only after the construction and installation of a communications system for the State of Florida is finished and the State of Florida has approved the system based on the guidelines set forth in the contract. Under the terms of the purchase and sale agreement, we do not believe we have any obligation to the sellers. However, the sellers have contested our position and initiated a lawsuit in June 2006 in the Court of Common Pleas in Allegheny County, Pennsylvania, which is in the motion pleading and discovery phase. A liability for this contingency has not been recorded on the Consolidated Financial Statements as we do not believe that any payment is probable or estimable at this time. 63 Table of Contents Off-Balance Sheet Arrangements Certain of our segments have guaranteed the performance of third parties and provided financial guarantees for uncompleted work and financial commitments. The terms of these guarantees vary with end dates ranging from fiscal 2011 through the completion of such transactions. The guarantees would be triggered in the event of nonperformance, and the potential exposure for nonperformance under the guarantees would not have a material effect on our results of operations, financial position, or cash flows. In disposing of assets or businesses, we often provide representations, warranties, and/or indemnities to cover various risks including unknown damage to the assets, environmental risks involved in the sale of real estate, liability for investigation and remediation of environmental contamination at waste disposal sites and manufacturing facilities, and unidentified tax liabilities and legal fees related to periods prior to disposition. We do not have the ability to estimate the potential liability from such indemnities because they relate to unknown conditions. However, we have no reason to believe that these uncertainties would have a material adverse effect on our results of operations, financial position, or cash flows. As of September 24, 2010, we had outstanding letters of credit and letters of guarantee in the amount of $390 million, of which $50 million was related to our contract with the State of New York. We have recorded liabilities for known indemnifications included as part of environmental liabilities. See Note 14 to the Consolidated Financial Statements for a discussion of these liabilities. In the normal course of business, we are liable for contract completion and product performance. In the opinion of management, except for the charges related to the contract with the State of New York discussed below, such obligations will not significantly affect our results of operations, financial position, or cash flows. In January 2009, the State of New York drew down $50 million against an irrevocable standby letter of credit funded by us. As a result, we recorded a pre-tax charge equal to the draw. Although we dispute that the State has any basis to do so, the State has the ability to draw up to an additional $50 million against the standby letter of credit which could result in additional charges and could have a significant adverse effect on our results of operations, financial position, and cash flows. Pursuant to the Separation and Distribution Agreement and Tax Sharing Agreement, upon separation, we entered into certain guarantee commitments and indemnifications with Tyco International and Covidien. Under these agreements, principally the Tax Sharing Agreement, Tyco International, Covidien, and Tyco Electronics share 27%, 42%, and 31%, respectively, of certain contingent liabilities relating to unresolved pre-separation tax matters of Tyco International. The effect of the Tax Sharing Agreement is to indemnify us for 69% of certain liabilities settled in cash by us with respect to unresolved pre-separation tax matters. Pursuant to that indemnification, we have made similar indemnifications to Tyco International and Covidien with respect to 31% of certain liabilities settled in cash by the companies relating to unresolved pre-separation tax matters. If any of the companies responsible for all or a portion of such liabilities were to default in its payment of costs or expenses related to any such liability, we would be responsible for a portion of the defaulting party or parties' obligation. These arrangements have been valued upon our separation from Tyco International in accordance with ASC 460 and, accordingly, liabilities amounting to $339 million were recorded on the Consolidated Balance Sheet at September 24, 2010. See Notes 13 and 14 to the Consolidated Financial Statements for additional information. We generally record estimated product warranty costs at the time of sale. See Note 13 to the Consolidated Financial Statements for further information regarding estimated product warranty. 64 Table of Contents Critical Accounting Policies and Estimates The preparation of the Consolidated Financial Statements in conformity with GAAP requires management to use judgment in making estimates and assumptions that affect the reported amounts of assets and liabilities, disclosure of contingent assets and liabilities, and the reported amounts of revenue and expenses. Our significant accounting policies are summarized in Note 3 to the Consolidated Financial Statements. The following noted accounting policies are based on, among other things, judgments and assumptions made by management that include inherent risks and uncertainties. Management's estimates are based on the relevant information available at the end of each period. Revenue Recognition Our revenue recognition policies are in accordance with ASC 605, Revenue Recognition , and SEC Staff Accounting Bulletin Nos. 101 and 104. Our revenues are generated principally from the sale of our products. Revenue from the sale of products is recognized at the time title and the risks and rewards of ownership pass to the customer. This generally occurs when the products reach the free-on-board shipping point, the sales price is fixed and determinable, and collection is reasonably assured. For those items where title has not yet transferred, we have deferred the recognition of revenue. A reserve for estimated returns is established at the time of sale based on historical return experience and is recorded as a reduction of sales. Other allowances include customer quantity and price discrepancies. A reserve for other allowances is generally established at the time of sale based on historical experience and is recorded as a reduction of sales. Contract revenues for construction related projects are recorded primarily on the percentage-of-completion method. Profits recognized on contracts in process are based upon estimated contract revenue and related cost to complete. Percentage-of-completion is measured based on the ratio of actual costs incurred to total estimated costs. Revisions in cost estimates as contracts progress have the effect of increasing or decreasing profits in the current period. Provisions for anticipated losses are made in the period in which they first become determinable. Contract revenues for construction related projects are generated primarily within our Subsea Communications segment. Inventories Inventories are recorded at the lower of cost or market value, except for inventoried costs which are costs incurred in the performance of long-term contracts primarily by our Subsea Communications segment. Provisions for slow moving and obsolete inventory are made based upon product demand and historical experience. Should future product demand change, existing inventory could become slow moving or obsolete and provisions would be increased accordingly. Goodwill and Other Intangible Assets Intangible assets acquired include both those that have a determinable life and residual goodwill. Intangible assets with a determinable life include primarily intellectual property consisting of patents, trademarks, and unpatented technology with estimates of recoverability ranging from 1 to 50 years that are amortized generally on a straight-line basis. An evaluation of the remaining useful life of intangible assets with a determinable life is performed on a periodic basis and when events and circumstances warrant an evaluation. We assess intangible assets with a determinable life for impairment consistent with our policy for assessing other long-lived assets. Goodwill is assessed for impairment separately from other intangible assets with a determinable life by comparing the carrying value of each reporting unit to its fair value on the first day of the fourth fiscal quarter of each year or whenever we believe a triggering event requiring a more frequent assessment has occurred. In assessing the existence of a triggering event, management relies on a number of factors including operating results, business plans, 65 Table of Contents economic projections, anticipated future cash flows, transactions, and market place data. There are inherent uncertainties related to these factors and management's judgment in applying them to the analysis of goodwill impairment. When testing for goodwill impairment, we follow the guidance prescribed in ASC 350, Intangibles Goodwill and Other . First, we perform a step I goodwill impairment test to identify a potential impairment. In doing so, we compare the fair value of a reporting unit with its carrying amount. If the carrying amount of a reporting unit exceeds its fair value, goodwill may be impaired and a step II goodwill impairment test is performed to measure the amount of any impairment loss. In the step II goodwill impairment test, we compare the implied fair value of reporting unit goodwill with the carrying amount of that goodwill. If the carrying amount of reporting unit goodwill exceeds its fair value, an impairment loss is recognized in an amount equal to the excess. The implied fair value of goodwill is determined in the same manner that the amount of goodwill recognized in a business combination is determined. We allocate the fair value of a reporting unit to all of the assets and liabilities of that unit, including intangible assets, as if the reporting unit had been acquired in a business combination. Any excess of the value of a reporting unit over the amounts assigned to its assets and liabilities is the implied fair value of goodwill. Estimates about fair value used in the step I goodwill impairment tests have been calculated using an income approach based on the present value of future cash flows of each reporting unit. The income approach has been generally supported by additional market transaction and guideline analyses. These approaches incorporate a number of assumptions including future growth rates, discount rates, and income tax rates in assessing fair value. Changes in economic and operating conditions impacting these assumptions could result in goodwill impairments in future periods. We completed our annual goodwill impairment test in the fourth quarter of fiscal 2010 and determined that no impairment existed and that the fair value of all reporting units to which goodwill is allocated is well in excess of the respective carrying value. Income Taxes In determining income for financial statement purposes, we must make certain estimates and judgments. These estimates and judgments affect the calculation of certain tax liabilities and the determination of the recoverability of certain of the deferred tax assets, which arise from temporary differences between the tax and financial statement recognition of revenue and expense. In evaluating our ability to recover our deferred tax assets, we consider all available positive and negative evidence including our past operating results, the existence of cumulative losses in the most recent years, and our forecast of future taxable income. In estimating future taxable income, we develop assumptions including the amount of future state, federal, and international pre-tax operating income, the reversal of temporary differences, and the implementation of feasible and prudent tax planning strategies. These assumptions require significant judgment about the forecasts of future taxable income and are consistent with the plans and estimates we are using to manage the underlying businesses. We currently have recorded significant valuation allowances that we intend to maintain until it is more likely than not the deferred tax assets will be realized. Our income tax expense recorded in the future will be reduced to the extent of decreases in our valuation allowances. The realization of our remaining deferred tax assets is primarily dependent on future taxable income in the appropriate jurisdiction. Any reduction in future taxable income including any future restructuring activities may require that we record an additional valuation allowance against our deferred tax assets. An increase in the valuation allowance would result in additional income tax expense in such period and could have a significant impact on our future earnings. Prior to September 26, 2009, if a change in a valuation allowance occurred, which was established in connection with an acquisition, the adjustment of such 66 Table of Contents allowance may have affected goodwill rather than the income tax provision. Subsequent to the adoption of the business combination provisions of ASC 805, Business Combinations , on September 26, 2009, any changes in a valuation allowance that was established in connection with an acquisition, regardless of when the acquisition occurred, will be reflected in the income tax provision. Changes in tax laws and rates also could affect recorded deferred tax assets and liabilities in the future. Management is not aware of any such changes that would have a material effect on our results of operations, financial position, or cash flows. In addition, the calculation of our tax liabilities includes estimates for uncertainties in the application of complex tax regulations across multiple global jurisdictions where we conduct our operations. Under the uncertain tax position provisions of ASC 740, Income Taxes , we recognize liabilities for tax as well as related interest for issues in the U.S. and other tax jurisdictions based on our estimate of whether, and the extent to which, additional taxes and related interest will be due. These tax liabilities and related interest are reflected net of the impact of related tax loss carryforwards as such tax loss carryforwards will be applied against these tax liabilities and will reduce the amount of cash tax payments due upon the eventual settlement with the tax authorities. These estimates may change due to changing facts and circumstances; however, due to the complexity of these uncertainties, the ultimate resolution may result in a settlement that differs from our current estimate of the tax liabilities and related interest. Further, management has reviewed with tax counsel the issues raised by certain taxing authorities and the adequacy of these recorded amounts. If our current estimate of tax and interest liabilities is less than the ultimate settlement, an additional charge to income tax expense may result. If our current estimate of tax and interest liabilities is more than the ultimate settlement, income tax benefits may be recognized. These tax liabilities and related interest are recorded in income taxes and accrued and other current liabilities on the Consolidated Balance Sheet. Pension and Postretirement Benefits Our pension expense and obligations are developed from actuarial assumptions. The funded status of our defined benefit pension and postretirement benefit plans is recognized in the Consolidated Balance Sheets. The funded status is measured as the difference between the fair value of plan assets and the benefit obligation at the measurement date. For defined benefit pension plans, the benefit obligation is the projected benefit obligation, which represents the actuarial present value of benefits expected to be paid upon retirement based on estimated future compensation levels. For the postretirement benefit plans, the benefit obligation is the accumulated postretirement benefit obligation, which represents the actuarial present value of postretirement benefits attributed to employee services already rendered. The fair value of plan assets represents the current market value of cumulative company and participant contributions made to irrevocable trust funds, held for the sole benefit of participants, which are invested by the trust funds. Our contribution amounts are actuarially determined. Net periodic pension benefit cost is based on the utilization of the projected unit credit method of calculation and is charged to the Consolidated Statements of Operations on a systematic basis over the expected average remaining service lives of current participants. Two critical assumptions in determining pension expense and obligations are the discount rate and expected long-term return on plan assets. We evaluate these assumptions at least annually. Other assumptions reflect demographic factors such as retirement, mortality, and employee turnover and are evaluated periodically and updated to reflect our actual experience. Actual results may differ from actuarial assumptions. The discount rate represents the market rate for high-quality fixed income investments and is used to calculate the present value of the expected future cash flows for benefit obligations to be paid under our pension plans. A decrease in the discount rate increases the present value of pension benefit obligations. A 25 basis point decrease in the discount rate would increase our 67 Table of Contents present value of pension obligations by $127 million, while a 25 basis point increase in the discount rate would decrease our present value of pension obligations by $122 million. We consider the current and expected asset allocations of our pension plans, as well as historical and expected long-term rates of return on those types of plan assets, in determining the expected long-term rate of return on plan assets. A 50 basis point decrease in the expected long-term return on plan assets would increase our pension expense by $9 million, while a 50 basis point increase in the expected long-term return on plan assets would decrease our pension expense by $9 million. During fiscal 2008, our investment committee made the decision to change the target asset allocation of the U.S. plans' master trust from 60% equity and 40% fixed income to 30% equity and 70% fixed income in an effort to better align asset risk with the anticipated payment of benefit obligations. The target asset allocation transition began in fiscal 2008. As of September 24, 2010, our actual asset allocation is approximately 45% equity and 55% fixed income. Asset reallocation will continue over a multi-year period based on the funded status of the U.S. plans' master trust and market conditions. Share-Based Compensation Under ASC 718, Compensation Stock Compensation , we determine the fair value of share awards on the date of grant using the Black-Scholes-Merton valuation model. The Black-Scholes-Merton model requires certain assumptions that involve judgment. Such assumptions are the expected share price volatility, expected annual dividend yield, expected life of options, and risk-free interest rate. (See Note 23 to the Consolidated Financial Statements for additional information related to share-based compensation.) An increase in the volatility of our stock will increase the amount of compensation expense on new awards. An increase in the holding period of options will also cause an increase in compensation expense. Dividend yields and risk-free interest rates are less difficult to estimate, but an increase in the dividend yield will cause a decrease in expense and an increase in the risk-free interest rate will increase compensation expense. Accounting Pronouncements Recently Adopted Accounting Pronouncements In December 2008, the Financial Accounting Standards Board ("FASB") issued updates to the guidance in ASC 715, Compensation Retirement Benefits , that enhance disclosures regarding assets in defined benefit pension or other postretirement plans. The updates to ASC 715 are effective for us in the fourth quarter of fiscal 2010. See Note 17 to the Consolidated Financial Statements for additional information related to fair value measurement of assets in defined benefit pension or other postretirement plans. In April 2009 and December 2007, the FASB issued guidance in ASC 805, Business Combinations , addressing the recognition and accounting for identifiable assets acquired, liabilities assumed, and noncontrolling interests in business combinations. We adopted the business combination provisions on September 26, 2009. Adoption did not have a material impact on our results of operations, financial position, or cash flows. In December 2007, the FASB issued updates to guidance in ASC 810, Consolidation , that address the accounting and reporting framework for noncontrolling interests by a parent company. We adopted the updates on September 26, 2009. As a result of adopting the presentation requirements related to noncontrolling interests, we retrospectively adjusted our Consolidated Financial Statements. Adoption of the accounting requirements for noncontrolling interests did not have a material impact on our results of operations, financial position, or cash flows. 68 Table of Contents In September 2006, the FASB issued guidance in ASC 820, Fair Value Measurements and Disclosures , and ASC 825, Financial Instruments, that defines fair value, establishes a framework for measuring fair value, expands disclosure about fair value measurements, and introduces the fair value option for certain financial assets and liabilities. We adopted the fair value provisions of ASC 820 in the first quarter of fiscal 2009. We have not elected the fair value option of ASC 825 for any eligible assets or liabilities. Prior to adoption, the fair value measurement and disclosure requirements for non-financial assets and liabilities were deferred by one year. We adopted the fair value provisions of ASC 820 for non-financial assets and liabilities on September 26, 2009. See Note 16 to the Consolidated Financial Statements for additional information related to fair value measurements. Recently Issued Accounting Pronouncements In June 2009, the FASB issued updates to guidance in ASC 810 that address accounting for variable interest entities. These updates to ASC 810 are effective for us in the first quarter of fiscal 2011. Adoption is not expected to have a material impact on our results of operations, financial position, or cash flows.
