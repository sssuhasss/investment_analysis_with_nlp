ACQUISITIONS Assets acquired and liabilities assumed in business combinations were recorded on the Company Consolidated Balance Sheets as of the respective acquisition dates based upon their estimated fair values at such dates. The results of operations of businesses acquired by the Company were included in the Company 28 Table of Contents Consolidated Statements of Earnings since their respective dates of acquisition. The excess of the purchase price over the estimated fair values of the underlying assets acquired and liabilities assumed was allocated to Goodwill. Acquisitions completed by the Company with an aggregate purchase price of greater than $15.0 million during the fiscal years ended June 30, 2011, 2010 and 2009, were as follows: During the fiscal year ended June 30, 2011, the Company acquired three businesses in the Investor Communication Solutions segment. A summary of each acquisition is as follows: NewRiver, Inc. In August 2010, the Company acquired NewRiver, a leader in mutual fund electronic investor disclosure solutions. The purchase price was $77.6 million, net of cash acquired. This acquisition resulted in $47.8 million of goodwill, after post-closing adjustments for deferred taxes. Intangible assets acquired, which totaled $27.3 million, consist primarily of customer relationships and software technology, which are being amortized over an eight-year and seven-year life, respectively. This acquisition was not material to the Company operations, financial position, or cash flows. Forefield, Inc. In December 2010, the Company acquired Forefield, a leading provider of real-time sales, education and client communication solutions for financial institutions and their advisors. The purchase price was $18.3 million, net of cash acquired. This acquisition resulted in $11.1 million of goodwill, after post-closing adjustments for deferred taxes. Intangible assets acquired, which totaled $6.8 million, primarily consist of customer relationships and software technology that are being amortized over a seven-year and a five-year life, respectively. This acquisition was not material to the Company operations, financial position, or cash flows. Matrix Financial Solutions, Inc. In January 2011, the Company acquired Matrix, a provider of mutual fund processing services for third party administrators, financial advisors, banks and wealth management professionals. Matrix back-office, trust, custody, trading and mutual fund settlement services will be integrated into Broadridge solution suite as part of Broadridge strategy to strengthen its role as a provider of data processing and distribution channel solutions to the mutual fund industry. The purchase price was $197.6 million, net of cash acquired. This acquisition resulted in $154.7 million of goodwill, after post-closing adjustments for deferred taxes. Goodwill primarily resulted from the Company expectation of sales growth and cost synergies from the integration of Matrix technology and product offerings with the Company technology and operations to provide an expansion of products and market reach. Intangible assets acquired, which totaled $71.5 million, consist of customer relationships, software technology, trademarks and non-compete agreements, and are being amortized over a ten-year, seven-year, five-year and three-year life, respectively. This acquisition was not material to the Company operations, financial position, or cash flows. During the fiscal year ended June 30, 2010, the Company acquired one business in the Securities Processing Solutions segment: City Networks, Ltd In June 2010, the Company acquired City Networks Ltd, a leading software and services provider of reconciliation, multi-asset process automation and operational risk management solutions to the global financial services industry, for $37.7 million. This acquisition resulted in $20.9 million of goodwill. Intangible assets 29 Table of Contents acquired, which totaled $10.6 million, consist primarily of customer relationships and acquired software technology, which are being amortized over a ten-year life and five-year life, respectively. This acquisition was not material to the Company operations, financial position, or cash flows. During the fiscal year ended June 30, 2009, the Company acquired one business in the Investor Communication Solutions segment: Access Data Corp. In May 2009, the Company acquired Access Data Corp., a leading provider of enterprise reporting and data management services for asset management firms and financial intermediaries, for $45.2 million. This acquisition resulted in $31.4 million of goodwill. Intangible assets acquired, which totaled $13.0 million, consist primarily of acquired technology and customer relationships that are being amortized over a five-year life and seven-year life, respectively. This acquisition was not material to the Company operations, financial position, or cash flows. The Company also completed acquisitions with individual aggregate purchase prices of less than $15.0 million during fiscal years 2011, 2010 and 2009, respectively, which were not material to the Company operations, financial position or cash flows. DIVESTITURES In November 2009, the Company and Ridge entered into an Asset Purchase Agreement with PWI and PFSI, to sell substantially all contracts of the securities clearing clients of Ridge to PFSI. On June 25, 2010, the Company completed the sale of the contracts of substantially all of the securities clearing clients of Ridge to PFSI, for an aggregate purchase price of $35.2 million. The purchase price paid to Broadridge consisted of (i) a five-year subordinated note from PWI in the principal amount of $20.6 million bearing interest at an annual rate equal to the LIBOR plus 550 basis points, and (ii) 2,455,627 shares of PWI common stock (representing 9.5% of PWI outstanding common stock as of May 31, 2010), at the June 25, 2010 closing price of PWI common stock of $5.95 per share. The purchase price was subject to certain adjustments post-closing upon the occurrence of agreed upon events including adjustments to reflect certain Ridge correspondent clearing contracts. During the fiscal year ended June 30, 2011, the few Ridge securities clearing clients that were not acquired by PWI de-converted off the Ridge processing platform. Ridge is no longer providing securities clearing services for correspondent broker-dealers but continues to provide operations outsourcing solutions aligned with the Securities Processing Solutions business. See Note 7, Discontinued Operations to our Consolidated Financial Statements under Item 8 of Part II of this Annual Report on Form 10-K for detailed information on discontinued operations. Concurrent with entering into the Asset Purchase Agreement, we entered into the Penson Outsourcing Agreement. Under the Penson Outsourcing Agreement, Ridge will provide securities processing and back-office support services to PFSI. This agreement includes selective processing services for PFSI existing securities processing operations and back-office functions, as well as selective processing services related to the clearing client contracts acquired by PFSI from Ridge. The Company is currently providing outsourcing services to PWI with respect to its Canadian correspondent customers as well as the U.S. correspondent customers who were parties to the contracts sold to PFSI by Ridge. The Company is in the process of converting the remainder of PWI U.S. securities processing operations and back-office functions business to our processing platforms and the Company expects to complete this conversion during the second quarter of the Company fiscal year ending June 30, 2012. On August 4, 2011, the Company and PWI signed a non-binding letter of intent which contemplates broadening the scope of the outsourcing to the Company to include PWI data centers in combination with IBM and other additional securities processing and back-office support services functions and activities, reimbursement of certain amounts related to PWI conversion, and extension of the term of the Penson Outsourcing Agreement. This letter of intent is not binding nor is it enforceable on the parties and the terms are subject to change and certain conditions including the negotiation and execution of a definitive agreement. 30 Table of Contents BORROWINGS On March 29, 2007, the Company entered into a $1,190.0 million senior unsecured credit facility, consisting of a $440.0 million five-year term loan, a $500.0 million five-year revolving credit facility and a $250.0 million one-year revolving credit facility. On March 29, 2007, the Company borrowed $440.0 million under the five-year term loan facility and $250.0 million under the one-year revolving credit facility. The proceeds received in connection with the $690.0 million of borrowings were paid to ADP on March 30, 2007 as a dividend in connection with our spin-off from ADP. These credit facilities are subject to covenants, including financial covenants consisting of a leverage ratio and an interest coverage ratio. At June 30, 2011 and 2010, the Company was not aware of any instances of non-compliance with the financial covenants of these credit facilities. The one-year revolving credit facility was cancelled upon repayment on May 29, 2007 with the net proceeds from the issuance of $250.0 million in aggregate principal amount of the 6.125% Senior Notes due 2017 (the Senior Notes ) and cash. The terms of the Senior Notes are governed by an indenture, dated as of May 29, 2007, by and between Broadridge and U.S. Bank National Association, as trustee thereunder. The Senior Notes are unsecured obligations of Broadridge and rank equally in right of payment with other unsecured and unsubordinated obligations of Broadridge. Interest is payable semiannually on June 1 and December 1 each year based on a fixed per annum rate equal to 6.125%. During fiscal year 2009, the Company completed the purchase of $125.0 million principal amount of the Senior Notes (including $1.0 million unamortized bond discount) pursuant to the cash tender offer for such notes. The consideration paid for the Senior Notes accepted for payment was $116.3 million. The completed purchase resulted in a one-time non-cash gain from early extinguishment of debt of $8.4 million. During the fiscal year ended June 30, 2011, the Company borrowed $240.0 million and subsequently repaid $40.0 million under the five-year revolving credit facility, with $200.0 million in outstanding borrowings remaining under this facility at June 30, 2011. The proceeds from this borrowing were used to fund the acquisition of Matrix. The Company repaid $240.0 million of the $440.0 million borrowing under the five-year term loan as follows: $70.0 million during the fiscal year ended June 30, 2007 and $170.0 million during the fiscal year ended June 30, 2008. According to the loan agreement, as a portion of the outstanding borrowing was paid down, the total borrowing capacity was reduced commensurately, leaving a borrowing capacity of $200.0 million at June 30, 2011. The Company intends to refinance the five-year revolving credit facility and the five-year term loan facility, both of which expire on March 29, 2012, during the first quarter of our next fiscal year ended June 30, 2012. The Company anticipates that the interest rates that will be included in these refinanced facilities will be higher as compared to the interest rates for the current facilities. Please refer to Note 12, Borrowings to our Consolidated Financial Statements under Item 8 of Part II of this Annual Report on Form 10-K for a more detailed discussion. BASIS OF PRESENTATION The Consolidated Financial Statements have been prepared in accordance with accounting principles generally accepted in the U.S. These Consolidated Financial Statements present the consolidated position of the Company. These Consolidated Financial Statements include the entities in which the Company directly or indirectly has a controlling financial interest and various entities in which the Company has investments recorded under the cost and equity methods of accounting. Intercompany balances and transactions have been eliminated. In presenting the Consolidated Financial Statements, management makes estimates and assumptions that affect the amounts reported and related disclosures. Estimates, by their nature, are based on judgment and available information. Accordingly, actual results could differ from those estimates. In management opinion, 31 Table of Contents the Consolidated Financial Statements contain all normal recurring adjustments necessary for a fair presentation of results reported. The results of operations reported for the periods presented are not necessarily indicative of the results of operations for subsequent periods. CRITICAL ACCOUNTING POLICIES We continually evaluate the accounting policies and estimates used to prepare the Consolidated Financial Statements. The estimates are based on historical experience and are believed to be reasonable. Actual amounts and results could differ from these estimates made by management. Certain accounting policies that require significant management estimates and are deemed critical to our results of operations or financial position are discussed below. Goodwill . We review the carrying value of all our goodwill in accordance with Accounting Standards Codification ( ASC ) No. 350, Intangibles Goodwill and Other ( ASC No. 350 ), by comparing the carrying value of our reporting units to their fair values. We are required to perform this comparison at least annually or more frequently if circumstances indicate possible impairment. When determining fair value, we utilize a discounted future cash flow approach using various assumptions, including projections of revenues based on assumed long-term growth rates, estimated costs and appropriate discount rates based on the particular business weighted-average cost of capital. The principal factors used in the discounted cash flow analysis requiring judgment are the projected future operating cash flows, the weighted-average cost of capital and the terminal value growth rate assumptions. The weighted-average cost of capital takes into account the relative weights of each component of our consolidated capital structure (equity and long-term debt). Our estimates of long-term growth and costs are based on historical data, various internal estimates and a variety of external sources, and are developed as part of our routine, long-range planning process. Changes in economic and operating conditions impacting these assumptions could result in goodwill impairments in future periods. We had $735.6 million of goodwill as of June 30, 2011. Given the significance of our goodwill, an adverse change to the fair value could result in an impairment charge, which could be material to our earnings. In January 2011, the Company acquired Matrix, which was tested separately as its own reporting unit for the annual goodwill impairment test at March 31, 2011. Matrix was excluded from the sensitivity analysis discussed below as it was acquired in January 2011. Accordingly, the carrying value of the net assets acquired approximated fair value at March 31, 2011. The Company performs a sensitivity analysis under Step 1 of the goodwill impairment test as prescribed in ASC No. 350, assuming hypothetical reductions in the fair values of our reporting units. A 10% change in our estimates of projected future operating cash flows, discount rates, or terminal value growth rates used in our calculations of the fair values of the reporting units would have no impact on the reported value of our goodwill. Income Taxes . We account for income taxes in accordance with ASC No. 740, Income Taxes, which establishes financial accounting and reporting standards for the effect of income taxes. The objectives of accounting for income taxes are to recognize the amount of taxes payable or refundable for the current year and deferred tax liabilities and assets for the future tax consequences of events that have been recognized in an entity financial statements or tax returns. Judgment is required in addressing the future tax consequences of events that have been recognized in our Consolidated Financial Statements or tax returns (e.g., realization of deferred tax assets, changes in tax laws or interpretations thereof). In addition, although currently not under any U.S. or foreign income tax exam for the period March 31, 2007 through June 30, 2011, in the future we expect to be subject to the continuous examination of our income tax returns by the IRS and other tax authorities. A change in the assessment of the outcomes of such matters could materially impact our Consolidated Financial Statements. As of June 30, 2011, we had estimated foreign net operating loss carryforwards of approximately $22.7 million of which $0.3 million expires in 2012 through 2018 and $22.4 million which has an indefinite utilization period. In addition, the Company has estimated U.S. federal net operating loss carryforwards of approximately $63.5 million, which expire in 2020 through 2029. We have recorded valuation allowances of 32 Table of Contents $12.1 million and $15.9 million at June 30, 2011 and 2010, respectively, because the Company does not believe that it is more likely than not that it will be able to utilize the deferred tax assets attributable to net operating and capital loss carryforwards of certain subsidiaries to offset future taxable earnings. Share-based Payments . ASC No. 718 Compensation Stock Compensation requires the measurement of stock-based compensation expense based on the fair value of the award on the date of grant. We determine the fair value of stock options issued by using a binomial option-pricing model. The binomial option-pricing model considers a range of assumptions related to volatility, dividend yield, risk-free interest rate and employee exercise behavior. Expected volatilities utilized in the binomial option-pricing model are based on a combination of implied market volatilities, historical volatility of our stock price and other factors. Similarly, the dividend yield is based on historical experience and expected future changes. The risk-free rate is derived from the U.S. Treasury yield curve in effect at the time of grant. The binomial option-pricing model also incorporates exercise and forfeiture assumptions based on an analysis of historical data. The expected life of the stock option grants is derived from the output of the binomial model and represents the period of time that options granted are expected to be outstanding. Determining these assumptions are subjective and complex, and therefore, a change in the assumptions utilized could impact the calculation of the fair value of our stock options. A hypothetical change of five percentage points applied to the volatility assumption used to determine the fair value of the fiscal year 2011 stock option grants would result in approximately a $0.1 million change in total pre-tax stock-based compensation expense for the fiscal year 2011 grants, which would be amortized over the vesting period. A hypothetical change of one year in the expected life assumption used to determine the fair value of the fiscal year 2011 stock option grants would result in approximately a $0.1 million change in the total pre-tax stock-based compensation expense for the fiscal year 2011 grants, which would be amortized over the vesting period. A hypothetical change of one percentage point in the forfeiture rate assumption used for the fiscal year 2011 stock option grants would result in approximately a $0.1 million change in the total pre-tax stock-based compensation expense for the fiscal year 2011 grants, which would be amortized over the vesting period. A hypothetical one-half percentage point change in the dividend yield assumption used to determine the fair value of the fiscal year 2011 stock option grants would result in approximately a $0.1 million change in the total pre-tax stock-based compensation expense for the fiscal year 2011 grants, which would be amortized over the vesting period. IBM IT SERVICES AGREEMENT In March 2010, the Company and IBM entered into the IT Services Agreement, under which IBM will provide certain aspects of the Company information technology infrastructure that are currently provided under a data center outsourcing services agreement with ADP. Under the IT Services Agreement, IBM will provide a broad range of technology services to the Company including supporting its mainframe, midrange, server, network and data center operations, as well as providing disaster recovery services. The Company has the option of incorporating additional services into the agreement over time. The Company expects that the migration of its data center processing from ADP to IBM will be completed by June 2012. The IT Services Agreement expires on June 30, 2022. The Company has the right to renew the initial term of the IT Services Agreement for up to one additional 12-month term. The Company expects to complete the migration of its data center processing from ADP to IBM by June 2012. ADP will continue to provide data processing services to the Company until the migration is complete. The Company is anticipating that it will realize approximately $25.0 million in average annual cost savings, net of deferred cost amortization, over the term of the IT Services Agreement beginning in the fiscal year ending June 30, 2013. The Company is in the early stages of this migration. During the course of the migration to IBM, the Company will incur migration costs as part of establishing an operable IBM data center. For the fiscal year ended June 30, 2011, the Company recorded expenses of $6.3 million in the Consolidated Statements of Earnings related to this agreement. The Company currently estimates that it will incur total migration costs of approximately $95.0 million related to this agreement until the migration is complete. We anticipate expensing 33 Table of Contents approximately $40.0 million of these costs and we plan to capitalize the remaining $55.0 million of migration costs. RESULTS OF OPERATIONS The following discussions of Analysis of Consolidated Statement of Earnings from Continuing Operations and Analysis of Reportable Segments refers to the fiscal year ended June 30, 2011 compared to the fiscal year ended June 30, 2010, and the fiscal year ended June 30, 2010 compared to the fiscal year ended June 30, 2009. The Analysis of Consolidated Statements of Earnings from Continuing Operations should be read in conjunction with the Analysis of Reportable Segments, which provides more detailed discussions concerning certain components of the Consolidated Statements of Earnings from Continuing Operations. Prior fiscal year pre-sale fulfillment revenues have been reclassified from event-driven revenues to recurring revenues to conform to the current fiscal year presentation. ANALYSIS OF CONSOLIDATED STATEMENT OF EARNINGS FROM CONTINUING OPERATIONS Fiscal Year 2011 Compared to Fiscal Year 2010 The table below presents Consolidated Statement of Earnings from continuing operations data for the fiscal years ended June 30, 2011 and 2010, and the dollar and percentage changes between periods: Years Ended June 30, 2011 2010 Change ($) (%) ($ in millions, except for per share amounts) Revenues $ 2,166.9 $ 2,209.2 $ (42.3 ) (2 ) Cost of revenues 1,617.1 1,616.4 0.7 Selling, general and administrative expenses 270.0 241.6 28.4 12 Other expenses, net 10.1 9.1 1.0 11 Total expenses 1,897.2 1,867.1 30.1 2 Earnings from continuing operations before income taxes 269.7 342.1 (72.4 ) (21 ) Margin 12.4 % 15.5 % (3.1 ) pts Provision for income taxes 97.9 117.0 (19.1 ) (16 ) Effective tax rate 36.3 % 34.2 % 2.1 pts Net earnings from continuing operations $ 171.8 $ 225.1 $ (53.3 ) (24 ) Basic earnings per share from continuing operations $ 1.38 $ 1.66 $ (0.28 ) (17 ) Diluted earnings per share from continuing operations $ 1.34 $ 1.62 $ (0.28 ) (17 ) Revenues . Revenues for the fiscal year ended June 30, 2011 were $2,166.9 million, a decrease of $42.3 million or 2%, compared to $2,209.2 million for the fiscal year ended June 30, 2010. The 2% decrease was driven by lower event-driven fee revenues of $121.4 million, mainly the result of a decrease in mutual fund proxy activity when compared to the record level of activity during the fiscal year ended June 30, 2010. Also contributing to the 2% decline were lower distribution revenues driven by the lower event-driven mutual fund proxy activity of $76.5 million, or 10%, down from $780.6 million to $704.1 million, for the fiscal year ended June 30, 2010 compared to the fiscal year ended June 30, 2011, respectively. These declines were partially offset by a positive contribution from recurring fee revenues of $143.2 million reflecting gains from acquisitions, and the Penson Outsourcing Agreement, revenue from closed sales less client losses (referred to as Net New Business herein), internal growth, and the favorable impact of foreign currency exchange rates of $12.4 million. Revenues from acquisitions and the Penson Outsourcing Agreement contributed $122.5 million. 34 Table of Contents Fee revenues in the Investor Communication Solutions segment are derived from both recurring and event-driven activity. In addition, the level of recurring and event-driven activity we process directly impacts distribution revenues. While event-driven activity is highly repeatable, it does not recur on a regular basis. The types of services we provide that comprise event-driven activity are: Mutual Fund Proxy: The proxy and related services we provide to mutual funds when certain events occur requiring a shareholder vote including changes in directors, sub-advisors, fee structures, investment restrictions, and mergers of funds. Mutual Fund Communications: Mutual fund communications services consist primarily of the distribution on behalf of mutual funds of supplemental information required to be provided to the annual mutual fund prospectus as a result of certain triggering events such as a change in portfolio managers. In addition, mutual fund communications consist of notices and marketing materials such as newsletters. Proxy Contests and Specials, Corporate Actions, and Other: The proxy services we provide in connection with shareholder meetings driven by special events such as proxy contests, mergers and acquisitions, and tender/exchange offers. Event-driven fee revenues are based on the number of special events and corporate transactions we process. These events are impacted by financial market conditions and regulatory compliance requirements, resulting in fluctuations in the timing and levels of event-driven activity. As such, the timing and level of event-driven activity and its potential impact on revenues and earnings is difficult to forecast. Generally, mutual fund proxy activity has been subject to a greater level of volatility than the other components of event-driven activity. During fiscal year 2010, the Company processed a record level of mutual fund proxy activity. In contrast, during fiscal year 2011, mutual fund proxy fee revenues were 74% lower than in fiscal year 2010. Although it is difficult to forecast the levels of event-driven activity, we expect that the portion of fee revenues derived from mutual fund proxy activity may continue to experience volatility in the future. However, the level of volatility experienced between fiscal year 2010 and fiscal year 2011 was greater than we have experienced in prior years. Included in the preceding and following Revenues discussions are Revenues derived from sales, a component of Net New Business. A sale is considered closed when the Company has received the signed client contract. For any services that do not require a contract, the sale is considered closed when the services are in production. For recurring revenue closed sales, the amount of the closed sale is generally a reasonable estimate of annual revenues to be generated by the closed sale based on client volumes or activity, excluding pass-through revenues such as distribution revenues. Event-driven revenue closed sales occur in the Investor Communication Solutions segment. The amount of the event-driven revenue closed sales is generally a reasonable estimate of production revenues to be generated by the closed sales based on client volumes or activity, excluding pass-through revenues such as distribution revenues. Larger recurring revenue closed sales can take up to 12 to 24 months to convert to revenues, particularly for the services provided by the Securities Processing Solutions segment. The majority of event-driven revenue closed sales are usually recognized during the year the contract is signed. Closed sales for the fiscal year ended June 30, 2011 were $133.7 million, a decrease of $41.3 million, or 24%, compared to $175.0 million for the fiscal year ended June 30, 2010. Recurring revenue closed sales for the fiscal year ended June 30, 2011 were $113.4 million, a decrease of $5.3 million, or 4%, compared to $118.7 million for the fiscal year ended June 30, 2010. Excluding the three large recurring revenue sales that are described below, recurring revenue closed sales for the fiscal year ended June 30, 2011 were $80.0 million, an increase of $1.9 million or 2%, compared to $78.1 million for the fiscal year ended June 30, 2010. During the fiscal years ended June 30, 2011 and 2010, the Investor Communication Solutions segment closed a fulfillment services recurring revenue sale with Fidelity Investments for $11.2 million and a transaction reporting services recurring revenue sale with Morgan Stanley Smith Barney LLC ( MSSB ) for $40.6 million, respectively. During the fiscal year ended June 30, 2011, the Securities Processing Solutions segment closed a recurring 35 Table of Contents revenue sale with a large global institutional bank for equity and fixed income securities processing services of $22.2 million. Event-driven revenue closed sales for the fiscal year ended June 30, 2011 were $20.3 million, a decrease of $36.0 million, or 64%, compared to $56.3 million for the fiscal year ended June 30, 2010, primarily due to lower registered mutual fund proxy and solicitation services. Total Expenses . Total expenses for the fiscal year ended June 30, 2011 were $1,897.2 million, an increase of $30.1 million, or 2%, compared to $1,867.1 million for the fiscal year ended June 30, 2010. The increase reflects higher Cost of revenues of $0.7 million, higher Selling, general and administrative expenses of $28.4 million, or 12%, and higher Other expenses, net of $1.0 million, or 11%. The increase in Total expenses relate mainly to acquisitions and the Penson Outsourcing Agreement of $136.6 million and IBM migration costs of $6.3 million, mostly offset by $112.8 million of lower expenses mainly from lower event-driven activity including the decline in cost of distribution revenues as discussed above. Cost of revenues for the fiscal year ended June 30, 2011 were $1,617.1 million, an increase of $0.7 million, compared to $1,616.4 million for the fiscal year ended June 30, 2010. The increase reflects costs of $105.9 million related to acquisitions and the Penson Outsourcing Agreement, IBM migration costs of $6.3 million, and fluctuations in foreign currency exchange rates of $5.5 million, virtually offset by lower distribution costs related to lower distribution revenues of $100.7 (excluding acquisitions and fluctuations in foreign currency exchange rates) and other variable costs of $17.0 million. Distribution cost of revenues for the fiscal year ended June 30, 2011 were $613.5 million, a decrease of $72.2 million, or 11%, compared to $685.7 million for the fiscal year ended June 30, 2010. Distribution cost of revenues consist primarily of postage related expenses.

The increase reflects higher contributions from fee revenues of $112.4 million and higher distribution revenues of $23.8 million. Distribution revenues consist primarily of postage related fees. Higher fee revenues of $112.4 million were primarily driven by $77.0 million in event-driven mutual fund proxy revenues. Also contributing to the 7% increase, were higher recurring revenues driven by a positive contribution from Net New Business including the contract with MSSB, and gains from acquisitions, partially offset by negative internal growth. Revenues were also favorably impacted by foreign currency exchange rates of $19.7 million. Closed sales for the fiscal year ended June 30, 2010 were $175.0 million, an increase of $36.4 million, or 26%, compared to $138.6 million for the fiscal year ended June 30, 2009.

The increase reflects $106.3 million, or 7% increase in Cost of revenues, $28.7 million, or 13% increase in Selling, general and administrative expenses, and a $5.1 million increase in Other expenses, net. Cost of revenues for the fiscal year ended June 30, 2010 were $1,616.4 million, an increase of $106.3 million, or 7%, compared to $1,510.1 million for the fiscal year ended June 30, 2009. The increase reflects higher expense relating to higher fee revenues driven by event-driven mutual fund proxy, the net impact of higher distribution costs related to higher distribution revenues, the integration of the MSSB contract, and acquisitions. Distribution cost of revenues for the fiscal year ended June 30, 2010 were $685.7 million, an increase of $21.2 million, or 3%, compared to $664.5 million for the fiscal year ended June 30, 2009.

Selling, general and administrative expenses for the fiscal year ended June 30, 2010 were $241.6 million, an increase of $28.7 million, or 13%, compared to $212.9 million for the fiscal year ended June 30, 2009. The increase is primarily due to one-time non-recurring credits of $7.4 million during the fiscal year ended June 30, 2009, $7.2 million higher selling expenses on a 26% increase in sales for the fiscal year ended June 30, 2010, increased costs related to strategic initiatives and investments of $6.8 million and the impact of foreign currency exchange rates of $2.0 million, partially offset by $2.2 million lower stock-based compensation expense related to special stock option grants to corporate officers during the fiscal year ended June 30, 2009 which vested immediately, were expensed upon vest, and did not recur during the fiscal year ended June 30, 2010. Other expenses, net for the fiscal year ended June 30, 2010 were $9.1 million, an increase of $5.1 million, compared to $4.0 million for the fiscal year ended June 30, 2009. The increase reflects the effect of the one-time gain of $8.4 million from the purchase of the Senior Notes during the fiscal year ended June 30, 2009, a lower foreign currency exchange gain of $0.9 million, partially offset by lower interest expense on Long-term debt of $4.5 million due to the decline in the weighted-average interest rate on the five-year term loan facility. Earnings from continuing operations before income taxes . Earnings from continuing operations before income taxes for the fiscal year ended June 30, 2010 were $342.1 million, a decrease of $3.9 million, or 1%, compared to $346.0 million for the fiscal year ended June 30, 2009.

The decrease in the Provision for income taxes and the Effective tax rate for the fiscal year ended June 30, 2010 compared to the fiscal year ended June 30, 2009 was primarily attributable to the release of a valuation allowance on a deferred tax asset relating to tax loss carryforwards, and lower enacted tax rates in certain non-U.S. tax jurisdictions. Net earnings from continuing operations and Basic and Diluted earnings per share from continuing operations . Net earnings from continuing operations for the fiscal year ended June 30, 2010 were $225.1 million, an increase of $2.0 million, or 1%, compared to $223.1 million for the fiscal year ended June 30, 2009. The increase in Net earnings from continuing operations reflects higher Revenues and a lower Effective tax rate, which more than offset the increase in Total expenses during the fiscal year ended June 30, 2010, compared to the fiscal year ended June 30, 2009, as discussed above. Basic and Diluted earnings per share from continuing operations for the fiscal year ended June 30, 2010 were $1.66, an increase of $0.06, or 4%, and $1.62, an increase of $0.04, or 3%, respectively, compared to $1.60 and $1.58 for the fiscal year ended June 30, 2009, respectively. 38 Table of Contents ANALYSIS OF REPORTABLE SEGMENTS As a result of Broadridge sale of substantially all of the contracts of the securities clearing clients of Ridge to PFSI, Broadridge now has two reportable operating business segments: (1) Investor Communication Solutions and (2) Securities Processing Solutions. Ridge securities clearing business is reflected in discontinued operations (see Note 1, Basis of Presentation and Note 7, Discontinued Operations to our Consolidated Financial Statements under Item 8 of Part II of this Annual Report on Form 10-K for detailed information on discontinued operations), and the operations outsourcing solutions business retained by Ridge is now reported as part of the Securities Processing Solutions business segment. This change is reflected in all prior periods presented in this Annual Report on Form 10-K. The primary components of Other are the elimination of intersegment revenues and profits as well as certain unallocated expenses. Foreign exchange is a reconciling item between the actual foreign exchange rates and budgeted foreign exchange rates. Certain corporate expenses, as well as certain centrally managed expenses, are allocated based upon budgeted amounts in a reasonable manner. Because the Company compensates the management of its various businesses on, among other factors, segment profit, the Company may elect to record certain segment-related expense items of an unusual or non-recurring nature in consolidation rather than reflect such items in segment profit.

Investor Communication Solutions segment Revenues for the fiscal year ended June 30, 2011 were $1,559.4 million, a decrease of $110.2 million, or 7%, compared to $1,669.6 million for the fiscal year ended June 30, 2010. The 7% decrease was driven by a decline in event-driven fee revenues of $121.4 million, 39 Table of Contents mainly the result of a decrease in mutual fund proxy activity when compared to the record level of activity during the fiscal year ended June 30, 2010. Also contributing to the 7% decline were lower distribution revenues of $76.5 million, or 10%, down from $780.6 million to $704.1 million, for the fiscal year ended June 30, 2010 compared to the fiscal year ended June 30, 2011, respectively. These declines were partially offset by recurring revenues from acquisitions completed during fiscal year 2011 and Net New Business mainly as a result of the contract with MSSB. Position growth, a key measure in the number of pieces processed, was unchanged for annual equity proxy and a positive 9% for mutual fund interim communications. The number of pieces processed decreased 11%, from 1,276.1 million pieces to 1,137.8 million pieces, driven primarily by the decline in event-driven mutual fund proxy activity. Revenues from acquisitions completed during fiscal year 2011 contributed $74.1 million. Earnings from continuing operations before income taxes . Earnings from continuing operations before income taxes for the fiscal year ended June 30, 2011 were $213.4 million, a decrease of $59.4 million, or 22%, compared to $272.8 million for the fiscal year ended June 30, 2010. The decrease was mainly driven by lower event-driven activity as discussed above. Margin decreased by 2.6 percentage points from 16.3% to 13.7% as a result of the decline in event-driven mutual fund proxy revenues and related distribution revenues. Excluding acquisitions, overall Margin decreased from 16.3% to 14.7%. Fiscal Year 2010 Compared to Fiscal Year 2009 Revenues . Investor Communication Solutions segment Revenues for the fiscal year ended June 30, 2010 were $1,669.6 million, an increase of $138.6 million, or 9%, compared to $1,531.0 million for the fiscal year ended June 30, 2009. The 9% increase was primarily driven by higher event-driven fee revenues from mutual fund proxy activity. Also contributing to the Revenue increase were higher recurring revenues driven by Net New Business in transaction reporting primarily as a result of the contract with MSSB and revenue gains from acquisitions. Distribution revenues for the fiscal year ended June 30, 2010 were $780.6 million, an increase of $23.8 million, or 3% compared to $756.8 million for the fiscal year ended June 30, 2009. Position growth, a key measure in the number of pieces processed, was negative 1% for annual equity proxy and a positive 6% for mutual fund interim communications. The number of pieces processed increased 7% from 1,196.8 million pieces to 1,276.1 million pieces driven primarily by event-driven mutual fund proxy activity. Earnings from continuing operations before income taxes . Earnings from continuing operations before income taxes for the fiscal year ended June 30, 2010 were $272.8 million, an increase of $23.9 million, or 10%, compared to $248.9 million for the fiscal year ended June 30, 2009.

Securities Processing Solutions Fiscal Year 2011 Compared to Fiscal Year 2010 Revenues . Securities Processing Solutions segment Revenues for the fiscal year ended June 30, 2011 were $593.6 million, an increase of $57.7 million, or 11%, compared to $535.9 million for the fiscal year ended June 30, 2010. Revenues from acquisitions and the Penson Outsourcing Agreement constituted 84% of the $57.7 million increase. The remaining $9.3 million or 16% increase in revenues, were from contributions by new business and internal growth, partially offset by the carryover impact of the prior fiscal year client losses and price concessions. Internal growth was driven by higher fixed income trade volumes. Earnings from continuing operations before income taxes . Earnings from continuing operations before income taxes for the fiscal year ended June 30, 2011 were $87.4 million, a decrease of $11.9 million, or 12%, compared to $99.3 million for the fiscal year ended June 30, 2010. Margin decreased by 3.8 percentage points to 14.7% for the fiscal year ended June 30, 2011.

Securities Processing Solutions segment Revenues for the fiscal year ended June 30, 2010 were $535.9 million, a decrease of $23.0 million, or 4%, compared to $558.9 million for the fiscal year ended June 30, 2009. The 4% decrease in Revenues was driven by the fiscal year 2009 carryover impact of client losses and price concessions as well as lower trade volumes in the equity and fixed income businesses, partially offset by new business. Operations outsourcing revenues were essentially unchanged. Earnings from continuing operations before income taxes . Earnings from continuing operations before income taxes for the fiscal year ended June 30, 2010 were $99.3 million, a decrease of $34.5 million, or 26%, compared to $133.8 million for the fiscal year ended June 30, 2009. Margin decreased by 5.4 percentage points to 18.5% for the fiscal year ended June 30, 2010. The decrease is primarily due to the impact of revenue mix. Other Fiscal Year 2011 Compared to Fiscal Year 2010 Revenues . Other segment Revenues for the fiscal year ended June 30, 2011 were $0.2 million, a decrease of $2.2 million, compared to $2.4 million for the fiscal year ended June 30, 2010 driven by one-time, non-recurring revenues during the fiscal year ended June 30, 2010. Loss from continuing operations before income taxes . Loss from continuing operations before income taxes was $41.3 million for the fiscal year ended June 30, 2011, an increase of $7.2 million, or 21%, compared to a $34.1 million loss from continuing operations before income taxes for the fiscal year ended June 30, 2010. The increased loss was primarily due to IBM migration costs incurred during the fiscal year ended June 30, 2011. Fiscal Year 2010 Compared to Fiscal Year 2009 Revenues . Other segment Revenues were $2.4 million, an increase of $0.9 million for the fiscal year ended June 30, 2010, compared to $1.5 million for the fiscal year ended June 30, 2009, reflecting primarily one-time non-recurring termination fees during the fiscal year ended June 30, 2010. Loss from continuing operations before income taxes . Loss from continuing operations before income taxes was $34.1 million for the fiscal year ended June 30, 2010, an increase of $1.6 million, compared to a $32.5 million loss from continuing operations before income taxes for the fiscal year ended June 30, 2009. The increased loss reflects the effect of the one-time gain from the purchase of the Senior Notes of $8.4 million during the fiscal year ended June 30, 2009 and a lower foreign currency exchange gain of $0.9 million. This loss was partially offset by lower interest expense on Long-term debt of $4.5 million due to the decline in the weighted-average interest rate on the five-year term loan facility, a decrease of $2.2 million in stock-based compensation expense due to special stock option grants to corporate officers, and a reduction in corporate spending. The increase also reflects $0.9 million in one-time termination fees during the fiscal year ended June 30, 2010. FINANCIAL CONDITION, LIQUIDITY AND CAPITAL RESOURCES At June 30, 2011 and 2010, Cash and cash equivalents were $241.5 million and $412.6 million, respectively. Total stockholders equity was $797.3 million and $807.1 million at June 30, 2011 and 2010, respectively. At June 30, 2011, net working capital was $(31.3) million, compared to $506.0 million at June 30, 2010, primarily as a result of $400.0 million in borrowings reclassified from long-term debt to short-term borrowings during the fiscal year ended June 30, 2011 as their maturity date is less than one year at June 30, 2011. As of June 30, 2011, $62.0 million of the $241.5 million of cash and cash equivalents was held by our foreign subsidiaries. If these funds are needed for our operations in the U.S., we would be required to accrue and pay U.S. taxes to repatriate these funds. However, our current plans do not demonstrate a need to repatriate them to fund our U.S. operations. 41 Table of Contents On March 29, 2007, the Company entered into a $1,190.0 million senior unsecured credit facility, consisting of a $440.0 million five-year term loan, a $500.0 million five-year revolving credit facility and a $250.0 million one-year revolving credit facility. On March 29, 2007, the Company borrowed $440.0 million under the five-year term loan facility and $250.0 million under the one-year revolving credit facility. The proceeds received in connection with the $690.0 million of borrowings were paid to ADP on March 30, 2007 as a dividend. The one-year revolving credit facility was cancelled upon repayment on May 29, 2007 with the net proceeds from the issuance of $250.0 million in aggregate principal amount of the Senior Notes and cash. The terms of the Senior Notes are governed by an indenture, dated as of May 29, 2007, by and between Broadridge and U.S. Bank National Association, as trustee thereunder. The Senior Notes are unsecured obligations of Broadridge and rank equally in right of payment with other unsecured and unsubordinated obligations of Broadridge. Interest is payable semiannually on June 1 and December 1 each year based on a fixed per annum rate equal to 6.125%. During fiscal year 2009, the Company completed the purchase of $125.0 million principal amount of the Senior Notes (including $1.0 million unamortized bond discount) pursuant to the cash tender offer for such notes. The consideration paid for the Senior Notes accepted for payment was $116.3 million. The completed purchase resulted in a one-time non-cash gain from early extinguishment of debt of $8.4 million. The Company repaid $240.0 million of the $440.0 million borrowing under the five-year term loan as follows: $70.0 million during the fiscal year ended June 30, 2007 and $170.0 million during the fiscal year ended June 30, 2008. Per terms of the loan agreement, as a portion of the outstanding borrowing was paid down, the total borrowing capacity was reduced commensurately, leaving a borrowing capacity of $200.0 million at June 30, 2011. The weighted-average interest rate on the five-year term loan facility was 0.77% and 0.85% for the fiscal years ended June 30, 2011 and 2010, respectively. During the fiscal year ended June 30, 2011, the Company borrowed $240.0 million and subsequently repaid $40.0 million under the five-year revolving credit facility. The proceeds from this borrowing were used to fund the acquisition of Matrix. The weighted-average interest rate on the five-year revolving credit facility was 0.57% for the fiscal year ended June 30, 2011. The Company intends to refinance the five-year revolving credit facility and the five-year term loan facility, both of which expire on March 29, 2012, during the first quarter of our fiscal year ended June 30, 2012. The Company anticipates that the interest rates that will be included in these refinanced facilities will be higher as compared to the interest rates for the current facilities. These credit facilities are subject to covenants, including financial covenants consisting of a leverage ratio and an interest coverage ratio. At June 30, 2011 and 2010, the Company was not aware of any instances of non-compliance with the financial covenants of these credit facilities. Please refer to Note 12, Borrowings to our Consolidated Financial Statements under Item 8 of Part II of this Annual Report on Form 10-K for a more detailed discussion. Based upon current and anticipated levels of operation, we believe that our cash on hand and cash flow from operations, combined with borrowings available under the credit facility, will be sufficient to enable us to meet our current and anticipated cash operating requirements, capital expenditures, and working capital needs. Please refer to the discussion of cash flows used in financing activities in the following section for further discussion of our financing activities. Cash Flows Net cash flows provided by operating activities were $190.9 million for the fiscal year ended June 30, 2011, a decrease of $169.2 million, compared to $360.1 million net cash flows provided during the fiscal year ended June 30, 2010. The decrease is primarily due to a decline in net earnings of continuing operations of $53.3 million and an increase in working capital of $100.5 million. The increase in working capital is primarily driven 42 Table of Contents by an increase in accounts receivable of $67.6 million, due to the timing of revenue and timing of collections, and a decrease in accrued broker fees of $15.7 million due to the timing of revenue. Net cash flows used in investing activities for the fiscal year ended June 30, 2011 were $340.8 million, an increase of $252.5 million, compared to $88.3 million for the fiscal year ended June 30, 2010. The increase primarily reflects higher spending of $258.3 million on acquisitions during the fiscal year ended June 30, 2011, compared to the fiscal year ended June 30, 2010, and higher purchases of intangible assets of $7.7 million slightly offset by a decline in capital expenditures of $13.5 million. Net cash flows used in financing activities for the fiscal year ended June 30, 2011 were $45.3 million which represents a decrease of $232.8 million, compared to $278.1 million for the fiscal year ended June 30, 2010. The decrease reflects $200.0 million in proceeds from Short-term borrowings and a decrease in the purchases of common stock of $46.8 million, partially offset by a decrease in proceeds from the exercise of stock options of $9.4 million and an increase in dividends paid of $8.2 million in the current fiscal year compared to the prior fiscal year. Income Taxes Before the spin-off from our former parent company ADP, the Company taxable income was included in separate income tax returns filed with the appropriate taxing jurisdictions, except for U.S. federal and certain state and foreign jurisdictions in which the Company taxable income is included in the income tax returns ADP or an ADP affiliate. Subsequent to the spin-off, the Company files its own U.S. federal, state and foreign returns. The provision for income taxes is computed as if the Company filed on a combined stand-alone or separate tax return basis, as applicable. The provision for income taxes does not reflect the Company inclusion in the tax returns of ADP or an ADP affiliate. Certain income taxes of the Company were paid by ADP or an ADP affiliate on behalf of the Company. The Company, headquartered in the U.S., is routinely examined by the IRS as part of the IRS U.S. federal income tax audit of ADP and is also routinely examined by the tax authorities in the U.S. states and foreign countries in which it conducts business. The tax years under audit examination vary by tax jurisdiction. With respect to U.S. federal income taxes, the Company was a member of the ADP U.S. federal income tax consolidated group through March 30, 2007. As a member of the ADP U.S. federal income tax consolidation, the Company is included in any IRS examination of ADP for periods up to and including March 30, 2007. ADP and the Company are currently under IRS audit for the fiscal year ended June 30, 1998 through the fiscal year ended June 30, 2002 which was substantially completed in fiscal year 2009. In addition, the IRS is conducting an examination of fiscal years 2003 through 2007. As a member of the ADP U.S. federal income tax consolidated group and pursuant to a tax allocation agreement between the Company and ADP, the U.S. federal income tax payable of the Company for the period ended March 30, 2007, will be assumed by ADP. In addition, any items of income or expense successfully challenged by the IRS attributable to the business operations of the Company for tax periods ended March 30, 2007 or earlier, will be tax liabilities assumed by ADP. Correspondingly, any items of income or expense attributable to the business operations of the Company for tax periods ended March 30, 2007 or earlier, which are settled favorably with the IRS by ADP will remain with ADP. Accordingly, the Company has not established any tax reserves or tax assets with respect to U.S. federal income taxes for the tax period ended March 30, 2007. The tax allocation agreement between the Company and ADP also extends to the Company U.S. state income tax and most foreign income tax liabilities and tax assets. Thus, for any foreign or U.S. state income tax liabilities or tax assets relating to tax periods ended March 30, 2007 or earlier attributable to the Company business operations, depending on the tax jurisdiction, ADP will either make payments directly to the appropriate tax authorities or reimburse the Company for tax payments the Company made to the tax authorities that related to tax liabilities subject to the tax allocation agreement to the extent that such tax liabilities are in excess of amounts provided for in respect of such income taxes on the Consolidated Balance Sheet of the Company including the Notes thereto, as of June 30, 2011. Similarly, to the extent that there are any tax refunds attributable 43 Table of Contents to the Company business operations in a particular tax jurisdiction for the period ended March 30, 2007 or earlier, ADP will either receive such refund directly from the appropriate tax authorities or receive reimbursement from the Company for the refund received by the Company that is subject to the tax allocation agreement. The Company regularly considers the likelihood of assessments in each of the jurisdictions resulting from examinations. To the extent the Company determines it has potential tax assessment in particular tax jurisdictions and that such assessments are not covered by the tax allocation agreement, the Company has established tax reserves which it believes are adequate in relation to the potential assessments. Once established, reserves are adjusted when there is more information available, when an event occurs necessitating a change to the reserves or the statute of limitations for the relevant taxing authority to examine the tax position has expired. The resolution of tax matters should not have a material effect on the financial condition of the Company or on the Company Consolidated Statements of Earnings for a particular future period. Defined Benefit Pension Plan The Company sponsors a Supplemental Officer Retirement Plan (the Broadridge SORP ). The Broadridge SORP is a defined benefit plan pursuant to which the Company will pay supplemental pension benefits to certain key officers upon retirement based upon the officers years of service and compensation. The amount charged to expense for the Broadridge SORP was $1.6 million, $1.2 million, and $0.6 million for the fiscal years ended June 30, 2011, 2010 and 2009, respectively. Broadridge management believes the Broadridge SORP expense is not material to the Company Consolidated Financial Statements. Contractual Obligations The following table summarizes our contractual obligations to third parties as of June 30, 2011 and the effect such obligations are expected to have on our liquidity and cash flows in future periods: Payments Due by Period Total Less than 1 Year 1-3 Years 4-5 Years After 5 Years (in millions) Debt(1) $ 524.3 $ 400.0 $ $ $ 124.3 Operating lease and software licenses(2) 113.6 38.7 41.9 19.6 13.4 Purchase obligations(3) 700.7 179.1 130.0 113.0 278.6 Total $ 1,338.6 $ 617.8 $ 171.9 $ 132.6 $ 416.3 (1) These amounts represent the principal repayments of Short-term and Long-term debt and are included on our Consolidated Balance Sheets. As of June 30, 2011, we had $524.3 million of outstanding debt consisting of $200.0 million of a term loan facility, $124.3 million in Senior Notes and $200.0 million of a revolving credit facility.

Excludes future cash payments related to interest expense as the term loan facility is variable rate and the interest payments will ultimately be determined by the rates in effect during each period. (2) Included in these amounts are various facilities and equipment leases and software license agreements. We enter into operating leases in the normal course of business relating to facilities and equipment, as well as the licensing of software. The majority of our lease agreements have fixed payment terms based on the passage of time. Certain facility and equipment leases require payment of maintenance and real estate taxes and contain escalation provisions based on future adjustments in price indices. Our future operating lease obligations could change if we exit certain contracts and if we enter into additional operating lease agreements. 44 Table of Contents (3) Purchase obligations primarily relate to payments to ADP related to a data center outsourcing services agreement that expires in fiscal year 2012, payments to IBM related to the IT Services Agreement entered into in March 2010 that expires in June 2022, and purchase and maintenance agreements on our software, equipment and other assets. The Company entered into a data center outsourcing services agreement with ADP under which ADP provides the Company with data center services. Among the principal services provided by the data center are information technology services and service delivery network services. Under the agreement, ADP is responsible for hosting the mainframe, midrange, open systems, and networks. Additionally, systems engineering, network engineering, hardware engineering, network operations, data center operations, application change management, and data center disaster recovery services are managed by ADP. The agreement will expire on June 30, 2012. For the fiscal years 2011, 2010 and 2009, the Company recorded $110.4 million, $104.8 million and $102.8 million, respectively, of expenses in the Consolidated Statements of Earnings related to this agreement. In March 2010, the Company and IBM entered into the IT Services Agreement, under which IBM will provide certain aspects of the Company information technology infrastructure that are currently provided under a data center outsourcing services agreement with ADP. Under the IT Services Agreement, IBM will provide a broad range of technology services to the Company including supporting its mainframe, midrange, server, network and data center operations, as well as providing disaster recovery services. The Company has the option of incorporating additional services into the agreement over time. The Company expects that the migration of its data center processing from ADP to IBM will be completed by June 2012. The IT Services Agreement expires on June 30, 2022. The Company has the right to renew the initial term of the IT Services Agreement for up to one additional 12-month term. For the fiscal year ended June 30, 2011, the Company recorded expenses of $6.3 million in the Consolidated Statements of Earnings related to this agreement. Other Commercial Commitments Immediately before the separation from ADP, certain of the Company foreign subsidiaries established unsecured, uncommitted lines of credit with banks. These lines of credit bear interest at a rate equal to LIBOR plus 250 basis points. There were no outstanding borrowings under these lines of credit at June 30, 2011. Off-Balance Sheet Arrangements It is not the Company business practice to enter into off-balance sheet arrangements. However, the Company is exposed to market risk from changes in foreign currency exchange rates that could impact its financial position, results of operations, and cash flows. The Company manages its exposure to these market risks through its regular operating and financing activities and, when deemed appropriate, through the use of derivative financial instruments. The Company uses derivative financial instruments as risk management tools and not for trading purposes. The Company was not a party to any derivative financial instruments at June 30, 2011, 2010 and 2009. In the normal course of business, the Company also enters into contracts in which it makes representations and warranties that relate to the performance of the Company products and services. The Company does not expect any material losses related to such representations and warranties, or collateral arrangements.
