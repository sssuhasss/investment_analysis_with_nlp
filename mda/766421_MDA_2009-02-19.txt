This overview summarizes the MD&A, which includes the following sections: Year in Review highlights from 2008 outlining some of the major events that happened during the year and how they affected our financial performance. Results of Operations an in-depth analysis of the results of operations of Alaska and Horizon for the three years presented in our consolidated financial statements. We believe this analysis will help the reader better understand our consolidated statements of operations. Financial and statistical data for Alaska and Horizon are also included here. This section includes forward-looking statements regarding our view of 2009. Critical Accounting Estimates a discussion of our accounting estimates that involve significant judgment and uncertainties. Liquidity and Capital Resources an analysis of cash flows, sources and uses of cash, contractual obligations, commitments and off-balance sheet arrangements, an overview of financial position and the impact of inflation and changing prices. YEAR IN REVIEW In 2008, we reported a consolidated net loss of $135.9 million compared to a consolidated net income of $124.3 million in 2007. The largest driver of the decline in results was fuel expense. Our fuel expense increased by $522.1 million over 2007, primarily as a result of the significantly higher average fuel prices in 2008. Oil prices reached record levels during the summer months, but declined sharply in the last few months of 2008. Even with the benefit of $122.7 million of net cash settlements from our fuel hedge program during the year, our economic fuel cost (as defined on page 39) increased $277.6 million, or 30%, on a 4.4% decline in fuel gallons consumed. This increase in fuel expense far exceeded the $156.6 million increase in total operating revenues. We also had the following notable items during 2008: revenue of $42.3 million associated with the change in Mileage Plan terms to delete accounts that have had no activity for two or more years. Previously, accounts could remain inactive for three years prior to deletion. fleet transition costs of $71.2 million compared to $14.1 million in 2007. restructuring charges of $12.9 million associated with reductions in work force. The revenue environment in 2008 was characterized by increased competition in our West Coast market and softer demand in the last half of the year due to the current economic recession. Yield at both companies improved over 2007 as we and other carriers added or increased ancillary fees and raised fares to cover higher fuel costs. Alaska posted slightly higher passenger traffic for the full year and Horizon posted a sharp decline in passenger traffic. All of these factors, along with a one-time $42.3 million benefit from changes in our Mileage Plan program, resulted in an increase in total consolidated operating revenues of $156.6 million. 29 Table of Contents Our total operating expenses increased by $539.7 million during 2008 compared to 2007, primarily as a result of the significant increase in fuel costs along with an increase in fleet transition costs and restructuring charges. This increase is offset by declines in non-fuel operating costs at both companies as we continued to make progress in our cost reduction efforts. See Results of Operations below for further discussion of changes in revenues and operating expenses for both Alaska and Horizon. Accomplishments and Highlights Accomplishments and highlights from 2008 include: Alaska and Horizon both improved their operational performance in 2008 as measured by on-time arrivals and completion rate. For the full year, Alaska reported an on-time performance and completion rate of 78.3% and 99.2%, respectively, compared to 72.4% and 99.0%, respectively, for 2007. Similarly, Horizon reported a 2008 on-time performance and completion rate of 83.1% and 97.9%, respectively, compared to 80.7% and 97.6% in 2007. Alaska received the J.D. Power and Associates Highest Customer Satisfaction award in 2008 among North America Airlines in a tie with Continental Airlines. Alaska won the 2007 Program of the Year Freddie award for our Mileage Plan program in 2008. We reached an enhanced long-term agreement with Delta that will benefit our customers as it makes us Delta preferred partner on the West Coast. Other benefits include enhanced frequent flyer and lounge reciprocity agreements. We completed our Airport of the Future at Seattle-Tacoma International Airport, reducing customer wait times significantly. The cargo business generated over $100 million of consolidated revenue for the first time in 2008. Alaska Fleet Transition We completed our transition to an all-B737 fleet in 2008 as our final MD-80 aircraft were removed from service during the year. We now have one of the youngest, most fuel-efficient fleets in the industry. We have four MD-80 aircraft under long-term lease arrangements that were retired prior to the end of their lease terms and placed in temporary storage at an aircraft storage facility. As a result of their grounding, we recorded a $47.5 million charge during 2008 associated with these aircraft representing the remaining obligation under the existing lease contracts. Horizon Fleet Transition Horizon is in the process of transitioning to an all-Q400 fleet and expects to complete the transition as soon as the CRJ-700 fleet is successfully remarketed. At the beginning of 2008, we had 17 Q200s in the fleet, of which we were able to remarket all but six through sublease agreements or arranged sales of the aircraft to third parties. The total charge during 2008 related to the removal of these aircraft from operation was $10.2 million, which represents the estimated sublease loss for five aircraft delivered under the sublease arrangement and the loss on the termination of the underlying leases of six additional aircraft. Although we removed all remaining Q200 aircraft from scheduled operations as of the end of 2008, six of the aircraft were used as spares through the end of January 2009. We are actively remarketing these remaining aircraft. We do not currently know the timing or amount of any associated charge. In the first quarter of 2008, our Board of Directors approved the plan to remove our CRJ-700 fleet from operations, in addition to the Q200 transition described above. As a result of the decision, the Company determined that its two owned CRJ-700s were impaired and recorded an impairment charge on the aircraft and their related spare parts of $5.5 million in 2008 to reduce the carrying value of these assets to their estimated fair value. Additionally, during 2008, we recorded severance charges of $1.3 million 30 Table of Contents related to this fleet transition. We are currently evaluating various alternatives to dispose of our CRJ-700 aircraft in the most economically feasible way. Two of our 18 leased aircraft were subleased to a third party during the fourth quarter, resulting in an estimated sublease loss of $6.7 million. The current economic conditions are hindering the remarketing effort and could result in further delays of the timeline to transition completely to an all-Q400 fleet. As such, the nature, timing or amount of any potential gain or loss associated with transactions on the remaining aircraft cannot be reasonably estimated at this time. Fuel Hedging We utilize primarily crude oil call options to decrease our exposure to the volatility of jet fuel prices, although we do have some collar structures that are scheduled to settle in 2009. The total outstanding liability for the collar contracts at December 31, 2008 is approximately $24 million, and we currently do not have any collateral on deposit with counterparties to these agreements. With call option contracts, we benefit from the decline in crude oil prices, as there is no future cash exposure above the premiums that we pay to enter into the contracts. In the fourth quarter of 2008, we restructured our hedge portfolio to take advantage of lower fuel prices. We were able to reduce our 2009 average strike price from $103 per barrel at the end of the third quarter of 2008 to $76 per barrel for 50% of the planned 2009 consumption. As part of this restructuring effort, we terminated some of the previously held contracts. We realized losses on the termination of these contracts of $41.5 million and $8.5 million at Alaska and Horizon, respectively, representing the difference between the original premiums paid to purchase those contracts and the cash received from the counterparty upon termination. We believe that restructuring the hedge portfolio was a wise use of our resources and consistent with our stated objective of managing volatility. Operational Performance Our core promise to our customers is to get them and their bags to their destinations safely and on time. Operational performance was a top initiative in 2008 and we believe we made significant progress during the year. For 2008, Alaska and Horizon both exceeded their prior-year performance in on-time arrivals and in schedule completion rates. As a result of the current-year performance, our employees received higher payouts under our Operational Performance Rewards program. Fees and Mileage Plan Changes Like many of our competitors, we have increased existing fees or implemented new fees in an effort to increase our revenues. Examples include: increasing the charge for booking through reservations and airport sales agents from $10 to $15, raising the fee for overweight baggage from $25 to $50, increasing the charge for transporting pets in the cabin from $75 to $100 one-way, and raising the unaccompanied minor fee from $30 to $75 for one-way nonstop flights and from $60 to $75 for connecting flights. The increases above were effective May 21, 2008. We also began charging $25 for a second checked bag effective July 1, 2008. First class and top-tier Mileage Plan members and customers on flights within the state of Alaska are exempt from the new fee. On July 24, 2008 we announced a $25 fee for booking Mileage Plan award travel on partner airlines. We also announced that our domestic round-trip Coach Saver award will increase to 25,000 miles from 20,000 miles, and we have expanded our 15,000-mile Intra-Alaska award levels in coach to an Intra-State award. This award offers travel wholly within one state for 15,000 award miles. Other changes include an increase in the award miles needed for Peak awards and the introduction of a three-tier award level structure. All of these changes are effective for awards redeemed on or after November 19, 2008. 31 Table of Contents Additionally, beginning in August 2008, we reduced from three years to two years the length of time that a Mileage Plan account could be inactive before the account is deleted. As a result of this change in terms, our Mileage Plan liability was reduced by $42.3 million. This benefit is recorded separately in operating revenues as Change in Mileage Plan terms. Update on Labor Negotiations Alaska is currently in negotiations with its pilots and has been since early 2007. The contract with Alaska pilots became amendable on May 1, 2007. The Air Line Pilots Association (ALPA) at Alaska has requested mediation from the National Mediation Board (NMB) in order to assist with contract negotiations. We have begun meeting with the NMB and hope to reach a negotiated contract that recognizes the important contributions that our pilots make while not harming our competitive position. Factoring in pay rates, productivity measures, pension, and post-retirement medical benefits, we believe our pilot unit costs are among the highest in the industry for the size of aircraft operated. Alaska and the Association of Flight Attendants have reached a tentative agreement to extend the current contract with Alaska flight attendants by two years. The current agreement becomes amendable on May 1, 2010. Horizon is currently in negotiations with the following work groups pilots, flight attendants, technicians and dispatchers. We do not know what the final outcome of these negotiations will be or when agreements will be reached. However, uncertainty around open contracts could distract some employees, reduce employee engagement in our business, and prevent us from achieving the operational goals (such as on-time and completion-rate targets) that we have set. Common Stock Repurchase In September 2007, our Board of Directors authorized the Company to repurchase up to $100 million of our common stock over a twelve-month period. We completed the repurchase in February 2008 buying back 4.1 million shares of our outstanding common stock, or 10% of the outstanding stock at the start of the program, at an average price of $24.31 per share. During the first quarter of 2008, we repurchased 1.5 million shares for approximately $37.2 million. On March 13, 2008, we announced a new $50 million common stock repurchase program. Through April 24, 2008, we had repurchased 605,700 shares of our common stock for approximately $11.7 million under this new program. The repurchased shares have been recorded as treasury shares in our condensed consolidated balance sheets. We temporarily stopped further repurchases under this program given the uncertainty in the economic environment and currently do not expect to repurchase any more shares prior to the expiration date in March 2009. Line of Credit Modification Alaska has a $185 million variable-rate credit facility that expires in March 2010. In the fourth quarter we borrowed $75 million from this facility and that amount was outstanding at December 31, 2008. On September 24, 2008, we entered into the Fourth Amendment to our $185 million variable-rate credit facility that eliminated all previous financial covenants and replaced them with a requirement to maintain a minimum unrestricted cash and marketable securities balance of $500 million. Outlook As we look forward to 2009, the two primary uncertainties are the demand environment and fuel prices. Although fuel prices have declined significantly since their record high in July 2008, the global financial instability and economic recession have put downward pressure on demand for air travel. Traffic was down by 4.4% and 22.4% at Alaska and Horizon, respectively, in the fourth quarter as the economic recession began to take its toll on travel behaviors of our customers. In anticipation of this decline in demand, the Alaska and Horizon reduced capacity by 7.1% and 21.1%, respectively, in the fourth quarter. We currently anticipate further capacity 32 Table of Contents reductions of 8% at Alaska and 9% at Horizon in 2009 compared with 2008. We believe the actions we are taking to reduce capacity are necessary and appropriate given the uncertainty in the demand outlook, although we do have the flexibility to adjust our capacity throughout the year to stay aligned with demand. Oil prices have declined from a record $147 per barrel in July to approximately $40 to $45 per barrel recently. That translates to a significant reduction in fuel cost for Air Group, although prices are still above historical levels. In July 2008, our average raw, unhedged price of jet fuel per gallon was $4.19 and is currently around $1.60 per gallon. Oil prices continue to be volatile, however, and prices could rise again. We continue to execute our hedging strategy to help remove some of the impact of that volatility on our financial results. RESULTS OF OPERATIONS 2008 COMPARED WITH 2007 Our consolidated net loss for 2008 was $135.9 million, or $3.74 per share, compared to net income of $124.3 million, or $3.07 per diluted share, in 2007. Both periods include gains and losses arising from fuel-hedging activities. In 2008, there were several other items, as noted below, that affect the comparability between the two years: restructuring charges of $12.9 million ($8.1 million after tax, or $0.22 per share) related to the reduction in work force at Alaska; fleet transition charges of $61.0 million ($38.2 million after tax, or $1.05 per share) related to the ongoing transitions out of the MD-80 and CRJ-700 fleets; and a $42.3 million benefit ($26.5 million after tax, or $0.73 per share) related to a change in the terms of our Mileage Plan program. We believe disclosure of the impact of these individual charges is useful information to investors because: it is useful to monitor performance without these items as it improves a reader ability to compare our results to other airlines; our results excluding these adjustments related to fuel hedge accounting and other items serve as the basis for our various employee incentive plans, thus the information allows investors to better understand the changes in variable incentive pay expense in our consolidated statements of operations; our results excluding these items are most often used in internal management and board reporting and decision-making; and we believe it is the basis by which we are evaluated by industry analysts. Our consolidated results are primarily driven by the results of our two operating carriers. Alaska and Horizon reported pretax losses of $153.3 million and $55.8 million, respectively, in 2008. Financial and statistical data for Alaska and Horizon are shown on pages 34 and 35, respectively. An in-depth discussion of the results of Alaska and Horizon begins on page 36. 33 Table of Contents ALASKA AIRLINES FINANCIAL AND STATISTICAL DATA Three Months Ended December 31 Year Ended December 31

See page 42 for additional line of business information. 35 Table of Contents ALASKA AIRLINES Alaska reported a loss before income taxes of $153.3 million during 2008 compared to income before income taxes of $215.0 million in 2007. The $368.3 million difference between the periods is primarily due to the $424.9 million increase in aircraft fuel expense (including hedging gains and losses) compared to the prior period, $47.5 million of fleet transition costs, and $12.9 million of restructuring charges partially offset by a $151.4 million increase in operating revenues. ALASKA REVENUES Total operating revenues increased $151.4 million, or 4.9%, in 2008 as compared to 2007. The components of Alaska revenue are summarized in the following table: Years Ended December 31 (in millions) 2008 2007 % Change Passenger revenue mainline $ 2,643.7 $ 2,547.2 3.8 Freight and mail 99.3 94.2 5.4 Other net 135.2 147.1 (8.1 ) Change in Mileage Plan terms 42.3 NM Total mainline operating revenues $ 2,920.5 $ 2,788.5 4.7 Passenger revenue purchased capacity 300.8 281.4 6.9 Total operating revenues $ 3,221.3 $ 3,069.9 4.9 NM = Not Meaningful Operating Revenue Mainline Mainline passenger revenue for the full year increased 3.8% on flat capacity and a 3.7% increase in passenger revenues per available seat mile (PRASM). The increase in mainline PRASM was the result of a 2.3% increase in yields and a 1.1-point increase in load factor compared to the prior-year period. An increase in Mileage Plan redemption revenue and higher ancillary fee revenue contributed significantly to the increase in yields compared to 2007. Although capacity and traffic were relatively flat, traffic declined in the third and fourth quarters as the economic recession deepened. In response, we reduced capacity, with the most significant reductions taking place in the fourth quarter. 36 Table of Contents Our advance bookings currently suggest that load factors will be relatively flat in the first quarter of 2009 compared to the same period in 2008, although that is with a 10% to 11% decline in capacity. Freight and mail revenues increased $5.1 million, or 5.4%, over 2007. The increase is due to increased yields for freight and mail and freight fuel surcharges, partially offset by a decline in freight volumes compared to the prior year. As fuel prices decline, fuel surcharge revenue is also expected to decline in 2009. Other net revenues declined $11.9 million, or 8.1%, primarily as a result of lower commission revenue on the sale of Mileage Plan miles to our non-airline partners. We anticipate lower sales of miles to our affinity card partner in 2009 as general consumer credit card spending declines due to the economic recession. Change in Mileage Plan Terms Beginning in August 2008, we reduced the length of time that a Mileage Plan account could be inactive from three years to two years before the account is deleted. As a result of this change in terms, our Mileage Plan liability was reduced by $42.3 million. This benefit is recorded separately in operating revenues as Change in Mileage Plan terms. Passenger Revenue Purchased Capacity Passenger revenue purchased capacity increased by $19.4 million over the same period in 2007 because of a 5.7% increase in unit revenues on relatively flat capacity. Unit revenues have increased due to a 6.8% increase in yields, offset by a 0.7-point decline in load factors compared to 2007. ALASKA EXPENSES For the year, total operating expenses increased $494.1 million, or 17.3%, compared to 2007 as a result of higher mainline operating costs, most notably aircraft fuel expense (including hedging gains and losses), fleet transition charges and restructuring charges. We believe it is useful to summarize operating expenses as follows, which is consistent with the way expenses are reported internally and evaluated by management. Years Ended December 31 Operating Expenses (in millions) 2008 2007 % Change Mainline operating expenses $ 3,036.5 $ 2,553.3 18.9 Purchased capacity costs 313.7 302.8 3.6 Total Operating Expenses $ 3,350.2 $ 2,856.1 17.3 Mainline Operating Expenses Significant mainline operating expense variances are described below. Along with our financial and statistical data on page 34, we are presenting here our line-item expenses on a per-ASM basis (in cents). We believe this information is useful to investors because it highlights areas in which costs have increased or decreased either more or less than capacity: Years Ended December 31, CASM Change 2008 2007 2006 2008 vs. 2007 2007 vs. 2006 Wages and benefits 3.06 3.11 3.20 (0.05 ) (0.09 ) Variable incentive pay 0.07 0.06 0.12 0.01 (0.06 ) Aircraft fuel, including hedging gains and losses 4.80 3.05 3.25 1.75 (0.20 ) Aircraft maintenance 0.62 0.62 0.67 (0.05 ) Aircraft rent 0.44 0.47 0.48 (0.03 ) (0.01 ) Landing fees and other rentals 0.69 0.70 0.68 (0.01 ) 0.02 Contracted services 0.54 0.51 0.50 0.03 0.01 Selling expenses 0.48 0.53 0.61 (0.05 ) (0.08 ) Depreciation and amortization 0.69 0.59 0.59 0.10 Food and beverage service 0.20 0.19 0.21 0.01 (0.02 ) Other 0.70 0.72 0.70 (0.02 ) 0.02 Restructuring charges and adjustments 0.05 0.11 0.05 (0.11 ) Fleet transition charges 0.20 0.81 0.20 (0.81 ) Total Mainline Operating Expenses per ASM 12.54 10.55 11.93 1.99 (1.38 ) 37 Table of Contents Additional line item information is provided below. Wages and Benefits Wages and benefits decreased during the full year of 2008 by $11.2 million, or 1.5%, primarily as a result of lower defined-benefit pension costs, overtime, and a 0.5% decrease in full-time equivalent employees compared to 2007. We currently expect wages and benefits to be flat in 2009 but to increase on a per-ASM basis. Although we expect a significant decline in full-time equivalent employees resulting from the recent reduction in work force, our defined-benefit pension costs are increasing substantially from $48 million in 2008 to an estimated $93 million next year because of poor market returns in 2008. This expectation is exclusive of any potential change in pilot wages that may result from our current contract negotiations. Variable Incentive Pay Variable incentive pay for 2008 increased $2.3 million or 17.0%, compared to 2007. The increase is primarily due to higher payouts under our Operational Performance Reward program, offset by lower overall payouts in our profit-sharing plans due to the decline in profitability from 2007. For our incentive pay plans, profit is generally defined as results excluding fleet transition costs, restructuring charges, and other amounts specified in the various incentive plan documents and with fuel stated on an economic basis. Air Group maintains several incentive plans that collectively cover all of our employees and create alignment for employees, customers and shareholders. These plans include both operational and financial performance metrics that, to a large extent, are based on certain annual financial targets. Aircraft Fuel Aircraft fuel expense includes both raw fuel expense (as defined below) plus the effect of mark-to-market adjustments to our portfolio of hedges included in our income statement as the value of that portfolio increases and decreases. Our aircraft fuel expense is very volatile, even between quarters, because it includes these gains or losses in the value of the underlying instruments as crude oil prices increase or decrease. Raw fuel expense is defined as the price that we generally pay at the airport, or the into-plane price, including taxes and fees. Raw fuel prices are impacted by world oil prices and refining costs, which can vary by region in the U.S. Raw fuel expense approximates cash paid to suppliers and does not reflect the effect of our fuel hedges. Aircraft fuel expense increased $424.9 million, or 57.6%, compared to 2007. The elements of the change are illustrated in the following table: Years Ended December 31 (in millions, except per-gallon amounts) 2008 2007 % Change Fuel gallons consumed 333.8 354.3 (5.8 ) Raw price per gallon $ 3.31 $ 2.33 42.1 Total raw fuel expense $ 1,103.8 $ 825.7 33.7 Net impact on fuel expense from (gains) and losses arising from fuel-hedging activities 58.6 (88.2 ) NM Aircraft fuel expense $ 1,162.4 $ 737.5 57.6 NM = Not meaningful Fuel gallons consumed decreased 5.8% due to the decrease in capacity and the improved fuel efficiency of our fleet as we completed the fleet transition out of the less-efficient MD-80 aircraft to newer, more-efficient B737-800 aircraft on relatively flat capacity for the year. Because the B737-800 aircraft are larger than the MD-80s, the flat capacity came on a 2.6% decline in revenue block hours. The raw fuel price per gallon increased by 42.1% as a result of higher West Coast jet fuel prices driven by higher crude oil costs for much of the year. Crude oil prices have declined dramatically since the record high set in July 2008. Based on the current price of jet fuel, we expect that the raw fuel price per gallon in the first quarter of 2009 will be significantly lower than in the same period of 2008. During 2008, we recorded significant mark-to-market losses reflecting a steep decline in the value of our fuel hedge portfolio as fuel 38 Table of Contents prices declined sharply late in the year. During 2007, we recorded mark-to-market gains reflecting an increase in the value of our fuel hedge portfolio between December 31, 2006 and December 31, 2007. Our hedge portfolio consists primarily of call options that are based on the price of crude oil. We also evaluate economic fuel expense , which we define as raw fuel expense less the cash we receive from hedge counterparties for hedges that settle during the period under their original contract expiration terms, offset by the premium expense that we paid for those contracts. A key difference between aircraft fuel expense and economic fuel expense is the timing of gain or loss recognition on our hedge portfolio. When we refer to economic fuel expense , we include gains only when they are realized through a cash receipt from our hedge contract counterparties for those contracts that were settled during the period based on their original contract settlement terms. We believe this is the best measure of the effect that fuel prices are currently having on our business because it most closely approximates the net cash outflow associated with purchasing fuel for our operations. Accordingly, many industry analysts evaluate our results using this measure, and it is the basis for most internal management reporting and incentive pay plans. Our economic fuel expense is calculated as follows: Years Ended December 31 (in millions, except per-gallon amounts) 2008 2007 % Change Raw fuel expense $ 1,103.8 $ 825.7 33.7 Less: cash received from settled hedges, net of premium expense recognized (101.8 ) (44.9 ) NM Economic fuel expense $ 1,002.0 $ 780.8 28.3 Fuel gallons consumed 333.8 354.3 (5.8 ) Economic fuel cost per gallon $ 3.00 $ 2.20 36.4 NM = Not meaningful The total net cash benefit from hedges that settled during 2008, excluding hedges that were terminated early, increased by $56.9 million to $101.8 million compared to 2007. This increase was primarily due to the record high crude oil prices during the year. As part of our effort to restructure our fuel-hedge portfolio as noted earlier, we terminated a number of contracts originally scheduled to settle in 2009 and 2010 and replaced them with new positions having lower average strike prices. As a result, we realized losses of approximately $41.5 million, representing the difference between the original premiums paid for those contracts when purchased and the amount of cash received from the counterparty on termination of the contracts. We do not anticipate further restructuring of the portfolio at this time. Based on current jet fuel prices, we expect our economic fuel expense to be lower in 2009 than in 2008 because of lower crude oil prices. Aircraft Rent Aircraft rent declined by $6.6 million, or 5.9% during 2008, because of the retirement of all remaining leased MD-80 aircraft, offset by one additional leased B737-800 aircraft since 2007. We expect aircraft rent will be flat to slightly higher in 2009 as the elimination of the MD-80 rent is offset by lease expense on B737-800 aircraft as we plan to finance six aircraft with sale-leaseback transactions. Landing Fees and Other Rents Landing fees and other rents declined by $2.4 million, or 1.4%, compared to 2007. The decline is primarily attributable to the decline in departures resulting in lower landing fees across the system. However, looking forward into 2009, even though we are expecting capacity and departure declines, airport costs may not decline ratably. Airport costs are generally spread across the airlines based on passenger counts and departures. As the industry cuts capacity, airport costs on a per-passenger or per-departure basis will likely increase. 39 Table of Contents Contracted Services During 2008, contracted services increased by $6.1 million, or 4.9%, compared to 2007. This is primarily due to efforts to improve our operational performance and the introduction of new stations in our route system where we contract airport services. We expect contracted services to decline approximately 5% in 2009 as we decrease our departures across the system and require less handling at airports. Selling Expenses Selling expenses declined $13.3 million, or 10.3%, compared to 2007. The decline is driven by lower ticket distribution fees and lower expenses associated with our Mileage Plan program. We expect selling expenses to increase slightly in 2009 primarily driven by increases in our advertising and marketing efforts tied to our initiative to increase unit revenues. Depreciation and Amortization Depreciation and amortization increased $23.6 million, or 16.6%, compared to 2007 as a result of the delivery of 11 B737-800 aircraft delivered in 2008. We expect depreciation and amortization to be about flat in 2009. Although we took delivery of 11 new aircraft in 2008 and expect ten more in 2009, we expect to sell up to four B737-700 aircraft and complete sale-leaseback transactions for six B737-800s. Other Operating Expenses Other operating expenses increased primarily because of higher personnel and crew costs, property taxes, and legal fees, partially offset by a decline in passenger remuneration costs stemming from our improved operational performance. Restructuring Charges and Fleet Transition Costs In the third quarter of 2008, we announced reductions in work force among union and non-union employees. The non-union employees that were affected by the reduction were terminated in the third quarter, resulting in a $1.6 million severance charge. For union personnel, we offered extended leaves, a voluntary furlough program, and an early-out package with a lump-sum payment based on years of service that included continuation of medical coverage and travel privileges for a specified period. In addition to the voluntary offers, there have been involuntary furloughs to achieve the target reduction in work force. We recorded an $11.3 million charge in 2008 representing the severance payments and estimated medical coverage obligation for the affected union employees. During 2008, we retired four MD-80 aircraft that were under long-term lease arrangements and placed them in temporary storage at an aircraft storage facility. The $47.5 million charge in the period represents the remaining lease payments under the lease contract and our estimate of maintenance costs that will be incurred in the future to meet the minimum return conditions under the lease requirements. Mainline Operating Costs per Available Seat Mile (CASM) Operating costs per ASM (CASM) is an important metric in the industry, and we use it to gauge the effectiveness of our cost-reduction efforts. Our effort to reduce unit costs focuses not only on controlling the actual dollars we spend, but also on increasing our capacity without adding a commensurate amount of cost. Our mainline operating costs per mainline ASM are summarized below: Years Ended December 31 2008 2007 % Change Total mainline operating expenses per ASM (CASM) 12.54 10.55 18.9 CASM includes the following components: Aircraft fuel costs per ASM 4.80 3.05 57.4 Restructuring costs per ASM 0.05 NM Fleet transition charges per ASM 0.20 NM NM = Not meaningful 40 Table of Contents We have separately listed in the above table our fuel costs, restructuring charges and fleet transition costs per ASM. These amounts are included in CASM, but for internal purposes we consistently use unit cost metrics that exclude fuel and certain special items to measure our cost-reduction progress. We believe that such analysis may be important to investors and other readers of these financial statements for the following reasons: By eliminating fuel expense and other special items from our unit cost metrics, we believe that we have better visibility into the results of our non-fuel cost-reduction initiatives. Our industry is highly competitive and is characterized by high fixed costs, so even a small reduction in non-fuel operating costs can result in a significant improvement in operating results. In addition, we believe that all domestic carriers are similarly impacted by changes in jet fuel costs over the long run, so it is important for management (and thus investors) to understand the impact of (and trends in) company-specific cost drivers such as labor rates and productivity, airport costs, maintenance costs, etc., which are more controllable by management. Mainline cost per ASM excluding fuel and certain special items is one of the most important measures used by managements of both Alaska and Horizon and by the Air Group Board of Directors in assessing quarterly and annual cost performance. For Alaska Airlines, these decision-makers evaluate operating results of the mainline operation, which includes the operation of the B737 fleet branded in Alaska Airlines livery. The revenues and expenses associated with purchased capacity are evaluated separately. Mainline cost per ASM excluding fuel, fleet transition charges and restructuring charges (and other items as specified in our plan documents) is an important metric for the employee incentive plan that covers company management and executives. Mainline cost per ASM excluding fuel and other special items is a measure commonly used by industry analysts, and we believe it is the basis by which they compare our airlines to others in the industry. The measure is also the subject of frequent questions from investors. Disclosure of the individual impact of certain noted items provides investors the ability to measure and monitor performance both with and without these special items. We believe that disclosing the impact of certain items, such as fleet transition costs and restructuring charges, is important because it provides information on significant items that are not necessarily indicative of future performance. Industry analysts and investors consistently measure our performance without these items for better comparability between periods and among other airlines. Although we disclose our mainline passenger unit revenues for Alaska, we do not (nor are we able to) evaluate mainline unit revenues excluding the impact that rising fuel costs have had on ticket prices. Economic fuel cost represents approximately 35% of our total mainline operating expenses, excluding fleet transition and restructuring charges and with fuel stated on an economic basis. Fluctuations in our fuel prices often drive changes in unit revenues in the mid-to-long term. Although we believe it is useful to evaluate non-fuel unit costs for the reasons noted above, we would caution readers of these financial statements not to place undue reliance on unit costs excluding fuel as a measure or predictor of future profitability because of the significant impact of fuel costs on our business. We currently forecast our mainline costs per ASM excluding fuel for the first quarter and the full year of 2009 to be up 11% to 12% and up 7% to 8%, respectively, compared to 2008. The increase in unit costs on a full-year basis is primarily due to the following: Expected capacity reductions of 8% for 2009; A $45 million increase in defined-benefit pension costs from $48 million in 2008 to an estimated $93 million in 2009; 41 Table of Contents An increase of $10 million in maintenance expense due to the timing of planned maintenance events and the start of a power-by-the-hour agreement on our B737-700 and B737-900 aircraft, which is expected to provide cost savings over the life of the agreement, but will result in higher expense in 2009; Approximately $10 million in additional aircraft rent that would have been reported as interest expense because of our decision to complete sale-leaseback transactions on six B737-800 aircraft; and An approximate $15 million increase in our expected incentive payouts in 2009 compared to 2008. Our current expectation is that our results will be better in 2009 compared to those in 2008. However, actual results can differ significantly as the revenue environment is uncertain and fuel is volatile. Purchased Capacity Costs Purchased capacity costs increased $10.9 million to $313.7 million during 2008 compared to $302.8 million in 2007. Of the total, $293.7 million was paid to Horizon under the capacity purchase arrangement (CPA) for 1.4 billion ASMs. This expense is eliminated in consolidation. HORIZON AIR Horizon reported a loss before income taxes of $55.8 million during 2008 compared to $10.7 million in 2007. The $45.1 million decline in profitability is primarily due to higher fuel costs and fleet transition costs, partially offset by lower non-fuel operating costs and higher operating revenues. HORIZON REVENUES In 2008, operating revenues increased $15.5 million, or 2.2%, compared to 2007. Horizon passenger revenues are summarized in the table below: Revenues (in millions) and % of ASMs Years Ended December 31 2008 2007 Revenues % ASMs Revenues % ASMs Passenger revenue from Horizon brand flying $ 429.2 61 $ 391.3 52 Revenue from CPA with Alaska 293.7 39 283.4 35 Revenue from CPA with Frontier JetExpress 34.5 13 Total passenger revenue and % of ASMs $ 722.9 100 % $ 709.2 100 % Line-of-business information is presented in the table below. In the CPAs, Horizon is insulated from market revenue factors and is guaranteed contractual revenue amounts based on operational capacity. As a result, yield and load factor information for the CPA arrangements are not presented.

However, the increase was largely due to the shift in capacity out of Frontier JetExpress flying (which produced relatively low RASM because of the nature of the contract) to higher RASM brand and Alaska CPA flying. As mentioned earlier, the Frontier JetExpress operation ceased in November 2007. Horizon brand flying includes routes in the Horizon system not covered by the Alaska CPA. Horizon has the inventory and revenue risk in these markets. Passenger revenue from Horizon brand flying increased $37.9 million, or 9.7%, on a 6.5% increase in brand capacity and a 3.2% increase in unit revenues. The increase in unit revenues was due to a 4.1% increase in yields in those markets, partially offset by a 0.7-point decline in load factor. Revenue from the CPA with Alaska totaled $293.7 million during 2008 compared to $283.4 million in 2007. The increase is primarily driven by the 2.7% increase in unit revenues on relatively flat capacity. Under the CPA, the fee paid by Alaska is based on Horizon operating costs plus a specified margin. This revenue is eliminated in consolidation. HORIZON EXPENSES Total operating expenses increased $55.7 million, or 7.7%, as compared to 2007. Along with our financial and statistical data on page 35, we are presenting here our line item expenses on a per-ASM basis (in cents): Years Ended December 31, CASM Change 2008 2007 2006 2008 vs. 2007 2007 vs. 2006 Wages and benefits 5.37 5.06 5.22 0.31 (0.16 ) Variable incentive pay 0.15 0.18 0.25 (0.03 ) (0.07 ) Aircraft fuel, including hedging gains and losses 6.53 3.49 3.21 3.04 0.28 Aircraft maintenance 1.61 2.31 2.03 (0.70 ) 0.28 Aircraft rent 1.57 1.65 1.92 (0.08 ) (0.27 ) Landing fees and other rentals 1.58 1.43 1.29 0.15 0.14 Contracted services 0.80 0.68 0.74 0.12 (0.06 ) Selling expenses 0.86 0.78 0.87 0.08 (0.09 ) Depreciation and amortization 1.04 0.85 0.51 0.19 0.34 Food and beverage service 0.07 0.07 0.08 (0.01 ) Other 1.19 1.22 1.29 (0.03 ) (0.07 ) Fleet transition costs CRJ-700 0.37 Fleet transition costs Q200 0.28 0.35 (0.07 ) 0.35 Total Operating Expenses per ASM 21.42 18.07 17.41 3.35 0.66 43 Table of Contents Significant period-over-period changes in the components of operating expenses are as follows: Wages and Benefits Wages and benefits decreased $7.2 million, or 3.6%, primarily as a result of a 5.1% decrease in FTEs. We expect that wages and benefits will decrease in 2009 as compared to 2008 as we continue to reduce capacity, resulting in fewer full-time equivalent employees. Aircraft Fuel Aircraft fuel expense increased $97.2 million, or 70.0%, compared to 2007. The elements of the change are illustrated in the following table: Years Ended December 31 (in millions, except per-gallon amounts) 2008 2007 % Change Fuel gallons consumed 66.9 64.8 3.2 Raw price per gallon $ 3.36 $ 2.41 39.4 Total raw fuel expense $ 225.0 $ 156.2 44.0 Impact on fuel expense from (gains) and losses arising from fuel-hedging activities 11.0 (17.4 ) NM Aircraft fuel expense $ 236.0 $ 138.8 70.0 NM = Not meaningful The 3.2% increase in consumption was driven by the elimination of Frontier JetExpress flying in 2007. As those aircraft were redeployed into the Horizon fleet, Horizon began purchasing the fuel, whereas under the JetExpress arrangement, fuel was purchased by Frontier. Offsetting these increases in fuel consumption is the decline in system capacity, which has led to lower fuel consumption needs. Additionally, we have had improved fuel efficiency of our fleet resulting from new Q400 aircraft deliveries as they replaced outgoing Q200 aircraft. The raw fuel price per gallon increased by 39.4% as a result of higher West Coast jet fuel prices driven by higher average crude oil costs and refinery margins. As at Alaska, we recorded significant mark-to-market losses in 2008 reflecting a steep decline in the value of our fuel hedge portfolio as fuel prices declined sharply throughout the year. During 2007, we recorded mark-to-market gains reflecting an increase in the value of our fuel hedge portfolio between December 31, 2006 and December 31, 2007. Our economic fuel expense is calculated as follows: Years Ended December 31 (in millions, except per-gallon amounts) 2008 2007 % Change Raw fuel expense $ 225.0 $ 156.2 44.0 Less: cash received from settled hedges, net of premium expense recognized (20.9 ) (8.5 ) NM Economic fuel expense $ 204.1 $ 147.7 38.2 Fuel gallons consumed 66.9 64.8 3.2 Economic fuel cost per gallon $ 3.05 $ 2.28 33.8 NM = Not meaningful The total net cash benefit from hedges that settled during 2008, excluding hedges that were terminated early, increased by $12.4 million to $20.9 million compared to 2007. This increase was primarily due to the record high crude oil prices during the year. Like Alaska, as part of the effort to restructure our fuel-hedge portfolio, we terminated a number of contracts originally scheduled to settle in 2009 and 2010 and replaced them with new positions with lower average strike prices. As a result, we realized losses of approximately $8.5 million representing the difference between the original premiums paid for those contracts when purchased and the amount of cash received from the counterparty on termination of the contracts. We do not anticipate further restructuring of the portfolio at this time. Based on current jet fuel prices, we expect our economic fuel expense to be lower in 2009 than in 2008 because of lower crude oil prices. 44 Table of Contents Aircraft Maintenance Aircraft maintenance expense decreased $33.8 million, or 36.7%, primarily as a result of fewer maintenance events and cost savings from process improvements. We currently expect that maintenance expense will increase in 2009 as we are planning for more scheduled events compared to 2008. Aircraft Rent Aircraft rent decreased $8.7 million, or 13.3%, from 2007 due to the lease termination of a number of Q200 aircraft along with the sublease of additional Q200 aircraft and two CRJ-700 aircraft to third parties. We expect that aircraft rent will decline in 2009 as a result of the further transition out of leased CRJ-700 aircraft. Depreciation and Amortization Depreciation and amortization increased $3.6 million, or 10.6%, as a result of the two new Q400s that were delivered in 2008 and the full-year depreciation on 13 Q400s delivered in 2007. We own all of these new aircraft. We anticipate that depreciation and amortization expense will continue to increase in 2009 as we take delivery of five more Q400s in the first quarter of 2009. Fleet Transition Costs Fleet transition costs associated with the sublease of Q200 aircraft were $8.7 million during 2008 compared to $14.1 million in 2007. All 16 of the Q200 aircraft under the existing sublease arrangement have been delivered. Although we continue to be obligated under the head leases on subleased aircraft, the discounted future lease payments are recorded as fleet transition costs at the time of the removal of the aircraft from operations. We also recorded a $1.5 million charge associated with six additional Q200s that were removed from operating service in 2008 and returned to the lessor. During 2008, as a result of the Board decision to retire the CRJ-700 fleet earlier than expected, we recorded a $5.5 million impairment charge associated with two owned CRJ-700 aircraft and related spare parts, $6.7 million associated with a net loss on the sublease arrangement for two leased CRJ-700 aircraft and $1.3 million for severance charges related to a reduction in work force. We expect to have further charges related to the exit of the CRJ-700 fleet in 2009, although we are unable to estimate the timing and amount of those charges at this time. Operating Costs per Available Seat Mile (CASM) Our operating costs per ASM are summarized below: Years Ended December 31 2008 2007 % Change Total operating expenses per ASM (CASM) 21.42 18.07 18.5 CASM includes the following components: Fuel costs per ASM 6.53 3.49 87.1 Fleet transition costs per ASM 0.65 0.35 NM NM = Not meaningful We currently forecast our costs per ASM excluding fuel and the CRJ fleet transition costs to be up about 3% to 4% and 6% to 7% for the first quarter and full year 2009, respectively, compared to 2008. The expected full-year increase in unit costs is primarily attributable to the expected 8% to 10% capacity reduction and an increase in maintenance costs, offset by declines in Q200 fleet transition costs other non-fuel operating costs. CONSOLIDATED NONOPERATING INCOME (EXPENSE) Net nonoperating expense was $41.0 million in 2008 compared to $10.4 million in 2007. Interest income declined by $11.5 million compared to 2007, primarily as a result of lower average portfolio returns, partially offset by a higher average cash and marketable securities balance. Interest expense increased $14.3 million because of new debt arrangements in 2007 and 2008, partially offset by lower interest rates on our variable-rate debt. Capitalized interest declined $4.6 million from 2007, 45 Table of Contents resulting from a decrease in pre-delivery deposits in connection with our orders for B737-800 and Bombardier Q400 aircraft. CONSOLIDATED INCOME TAX EXPENSE (BENEFIT) Our consolidated effective income tax rate on income (loss) before income taxes for 2008 was 36.3% compared to an effective income tax rate of 38.0% in 2007. The effective rate for 2007 was positively impacted by $2.1 million in credits resulting from a favorable outcome of the state income tax matters referred to in Note 11. Excluding this benefit, our effective tax rate would have been 39.0%. The difference between the effective tax rates for both periods and our marginal tax rate of approximately 37.5% is primarily the magnitude of nondeductible expenses, such as employee per-diem costs and stock-based compensation expense recorded for certain stock awards. 2007 COMPARED WITH 2006 Our consolidated net income for 2007 was $124.3 million, or $3.07 per diluted share, compared to a net loss of $54.5 million, or $1.44 per share, in 2006. Both the 2007 and 2006 results include adjustments to reflect the timing of gain or loss recognition resulting from mark-to-market accounting on fuel hedge portfolio and other certain significant items noted below that affect the comparability of the years: Our 2006 consolidated net loss includes charges of $189.5 million ($118.5 million after tax) associated with our fleet transition plan (See Note 2 to the consolidated financial statements); We recorded restructuring charges of $24.8 million ($15.5 million after tax) in 2006 associated with the severance packages offered to eligible employees affected by new contracts; We believe disclosure of the impact of these individual charges is useful information to investors because of the reasons provided above in the 2008 Compared With 2007 section. ALASKA AIRLINES Alaska reported income before income taxes of $215.0 million during 2007 compared to a loss before income taxes of $94.7 million in 2006. The $309.7 million difference between the years is primarily due to the fleet transition and restructuring charges recognized in 2006 totaling $218.4 million. ALASKA REVENUES Total operating revenues increased $377.4 million, or 14.0%, in 2007 as compared to 2006. The Capacity Purchase Agreement with Horizon, which was new in 2007, made up $265.0 million of the increase, with mainline revenues contributing $112.4 million of the increase. Operating Revenue Mainline Mainline passenger revenue increased 3.8% on a 4.0% increase in available seat miles offset by a modest decline in mainline passenger revenue per available seat mile (PRASM). The slight decline in PRASM was the result of a 0.3% increase in yields, offset by a 0.4-point decline in load factor compared to the prior period. Freight and mail revenue was flat compared to 2006. This is primarily due to a decline in freight and mail volumes resulting from lower capacity that stemmed from the delay in the conversion of four of our B737-400 passenger aircraft to combi aircraft, offset by an increase in cargo yields, including those coming through fuel surcharges. Other net revenues increased $17.5 million, or 13.5%, primarily as a result of higher commission revenue associated with the sale of mileage credits to our bank partner. Passenger Revenue Purchased Capacity Passenger revenue purchased capacity increased by $265.0 million to $281.4 million because of the CPA with Horizon. In 2006, Horizon recorded $221.5 million in revenues for markets covered by the prior revenue-sharing arrangement. Yields in those markets declined 3.3% and load factor increased 1.5 points on a 29.7% increase in capacity. 46 Table of Contents ALASKA EXPENSES For the year, total operating expenses increased $64.9 million compared to 2006 as a result of new purchased capacity costs recorded under the CPA with Horizon, offset by a decline in mainline operating costs. Mainline Operating Expenses Total mainline operating costs for 2007 declined by $223.6 million or 8.0% compared to 2006. The absence of the fleet transition costs and restructuring charges in 2007, and lower aircraft fuel expense resulting from mark-to-market gains associated with the value of our fuel hedge portfolio were the primary causes of the decline. Wages and Benefits Wages and benefits were relatively flat in 2007 compared to 2006, primarily as a result of the following: a 3.8% increase in full-time equivalents. The number of full-time equivalent employees increased largely as a result of our initiatives in 2007 to improve our on-time performance and other operational goals; an increase in the number of flight attendants as we transitioned to B737-800s, which have four flight attendants, compared to three in the MD-80 aircraft that were replaced; and normal step, scale and market-based wage increases. These increases were offset by the following: 2006 included a $2.7 million contract-signing bonus paid to our flight attendants and a $1.9 million contract-signing bonus paid to our clerical, office and passenger service employees and our ramp service and stores agents; and a reduction of $15.6 million in expenses associated with our defined-benefit plans as more of our employees transition over to an enhanced defined-contribution plan, offset by a $1.2 million increase in defined-contribution plan expense. Variable Incentive Pay Variable incentive pay for 2007 decreased $14.2 million or 51.3%, compared to 2006. The decrease results from lower annual expense under the various Air Group profit-based incentive plans as our profitability was lower than originally expected, offset by higher expenses associated with our Operational Performance Rewards plan. Aircraft Fuel Aircraft fuel decreased $19.5 million, or 2.6%, in 2007 compared to 2006. The elements of the change are illustrated in the following table: Year Ended December 31 (in millions, except per-gallon amounts) 2007 2006 % Change Fuel gallons consumed 354.3 354.3 0.0 Raw price per gallon $ 2.33 $ 2.16 7.9 Total raw fuel expense $ 825.7 $ 765.6 7.9 Impact on fuel expense from (gains) and losses arising from fuel-hedging activities (88.2 ) (8.6 ) NM Aircraft fuel expense $ 737.5 $ 757.0 (2.6 ) NM = Not meaningful Fuel gallons consumed were flat on a 4.0% increase in capacity because of the improved fuel efficiency of our fleet as we transitioned out of the less-efficient MD-80 aircraft to newer, more-efficient B737-800 aircraft. The raw fuel price per gallon increased by 7.9% as a result of higher West Coast jet fuel prices driven by higher crude oil costs. During 2007, we recorded mark-to-market gains reflecting an increase in the value of our fuel hedge portfolio between December 31, 2006 and December 31, 2007. In 2006, we recorded a mark-to-market loss, as oil prices on December 31, 2006 were lower than they were a year earlier. 47 Table of Contents Our economic fuel expense is calculated as follows: Year Ended December 31 (in millions, except per-gallon amounts) 2007 2006 % Change Raw fuel expense $ 825.7 $ 765.6 7.9 Less: cash received from settled hedges (44.9 ) (87.0 ) NM Economic fuel expense $ 780.8 $ 678.6 15.1 Fuel gallons consumed 354.3 354.3 0.0 Economic fuel cost per gallon $ 2.20 $ 1.92 14.6 NM = Not meaningful Aircraft Maintenance Aircraft maintenance declined by $7.0 million, or 4.5%, compared to the prior year largely as a result of the benefits of our fleet transition as we replaced our aging MD-80s and B737-200C aircraft with newer B737-800 and converted B737-400 aircraft, respectively. Aircraft Rent Aircraft rent increased by $1.9 million, or 1.7%, because of the sale and short-term leaseback of substantially all of our owned MD-80 aircraft during the second quarter of 2007 and the addition of two new leased B737-800 aircraft in the fourth quarter of 2006, partially offset by the buyout of five leased MD-80 aircraft in the third quarter of 2006. Landing Fees and Other Rentals Landing fees and other rentals increased by $11.9 million, or 7.5%, compared to 2006 as a result of higher costs at Seattle-Tacoma International and other airports. Selling Expenses Selling expenses declined by $12.2 million, or 8.6%, compared to 2006 as a result of lower ticket distribution costs and credit card fees that resulted from new contracts that were put into place in the fourth quarter of 2006. The 2006 amount also included $3.7 million paid to Horizon under the revenue-sharing arrangement in certain designated markets that existed in 2006, compared to zero in 2007 because of the new CPA. These declines were partially offset by higher advertising costs. Depreciation and Amortization Depreciation and amortization increased $4.5 million, or 3.3%, compared to 2006. This is primarily the result of 10 new B737-800 aircraft delivered in 2006 and 14 in 2007, partially offset by the sale and leaseback of 20 MD-80s in 2007. Other Operating Expenses Other operating expenses increased because of higher passenger remuneration costs, crew costs, professional fees, software license and maintenance costs, higher property taxes, and other costs, offset by lower liability insurance expense because of better rates negotiated in December 2006. Mainline Operating Costs per Available Seat Mile (CASM) Operating costs per ASM (CASM) is an important metric in the industry, and we use it to gauge the effectiveness of our cost-reduction efforts. Our effort to reduce unit costs focuses not only on controlling the actual dollars we spend, but also on increasing our capacity without adding a commensurate amount of cost. Our mainline operating costs per mainline ASM are summarized below: Years Ended December 31 2007 2006 % Change Total mainline operating expenses per ASM (CASM) 10.55 11.93 (11.6 ) CASM includes the following components: Fuel costs per ASM 3.05 3.25 (6.2 ) Fleet transition costs per ASM 0.81 NM Restructuring charges per ASM 0.11 NM NM = Not meaningful 48 Table of Contents HORIZON AIR Horizon reported a loss before income taxes of $10.7 million during 2007 compared to income before income taxes of $11.3 million in 2006. The $22.0 million decrease is primarily due to higher operating costs, including higher fuel costs and fleet transition costs of $14.1 million, partially offset by higher operating revenues. HORIZON AIR REVENUES In 2007, operating revenues increased $74.4 million, or 11.6%, compared to 2006. Horizon passenger revenues are summarized in the table below: Revenues (in millions) and % of ASMs Years Ended December 31 2007 2006 Revenues % ASMs Revenues % ASMs Passenger revenue from Horizon brand flying $ 391.3 52 $ 359.1 48 Revenue from CPA with Alaska 283.4 35 n/a n/a Passenger revenue Alaska revenue share markets n/a n/a 221.5 29 Revenue from CPA with Frontier JetExpress 34.5 13 52.5 23 Total Passenger Revenue and % of ASMs $ 709.2 100 % $ 633.1 100 % Horizon system-wide operating revenues per ASM increased by 1.9% from 2006. The increase was largely due to the shift in capacity out of Frontier JetExpress flying (which produced relatively low RASM because of the terms of the contract and the longer-haul nature of the flying) to higher RASM brand and Alaska CPA flying. Line-of-business information is presented in the table below. In both CPA arrangements, Horizon is insulated from market revenue factors and is guaranteed contractual revenue amounts based on operational capacity. As a result, yield and load factor information for the CPA arrangements are not presented. Year Ended December 31, 2007 Capacity and Mix Load Factor Yield RASM Actual (000,000) % Change Yr-over-Yr Current % Total Point Change Yr-over-Yr Actual Point Change Yr-over-Yr Actual % Change Yr-over-Yr Actual % Change Yr-over-Yr Brand Flying 2,086 19.6 52 % 4 pts 71.8 % (2.4 ) pts 26.14 (5.9 ) 19.20 (8.8 ) Alaska CPA 1,383 29.7 35 % 6 pts NM NM NM NM 20.49 (2.7 ) Frontier CPA 509 (38.1 ) 13 % (10 ) pts NM NM NM NM 6.77 6.0 System Total 3,978 9.5 100 % 73.4 % (0.7 ) pts 24.30 3.3 18.06 1.9 NM = Not meaningful 49 Table of Contents Horizon brand flying includes routes in the Horizon system not covered by the Alaska CPA. Horizon has the inventory and revenue risk in these markets. Passenger revenue from Horizon brand flying increased $32.2 million, or 9.0%, on a 19.6% increase in brand capacity offset by an 8.8% decline in unit revenues. The decline in unit revenues was due to a 2.4-point reduction in load factor, along with a 5.9% decline in yields, resulting from increased competition in many of these brand markets and from intentional pricing actions taken in certain markets to fill the additional capacity. Revenue from the CPA with Alaska totaled $283.4 million during 2007. Under the CPA, the fee paid by Alaska is based on Horizon actual operating costs plus a specified margin. Under the prior revenue-sharing arrangement, Alaska made a payment to Horizon equal to Horizon loss in those markets, if any, and a quarterly bonus that was based on Alaska overall operating margin. Alternatively, Horizon made a payment to Alaska if those markets were profitable. Revenue from the Frontier JetExpress flying declined 34.3% from $52.5 million in 2006 to $34.5 million in 2007 on a 38.1% decline in ASMs. The ASM decline is consistent with the wind-down of the JetExpress arrangement that occurred throughout 2007. HORIZON EXPENSES Total operating expenses increased $86.8 million, or 13.7%, as compared to 2006. Explanations of significant year-over-year changes in the components of operating expenses in dollar terms are as follows: Wages and Benefits Wages and benefits increased $11.6 million, or 6.1%, as a result of a slight increase in full-time equivalent employees, higher wages due to market and step increases, and an increase in our group medical costs. Aircraft Fuel Aircraft fuel expense increased $22.3 million, or 19.1%, compared to 2006. The elements of the change are illustrated in the following table: (in millions, except per-gallon amounts) Year Ended December 31 2007 2006 % Change Fuel gallons consumed 64.8 54.3 19.3 Raw price per gallon $ 2.41 $ 2.19 10.0 Total raw fuel expense $ 156.2 $ 119.1 31.2 Impact on fuel expense from (gains) and losses arising from fuel-hedging activities (17.4 ) (2.6 ) NM Aircraft fuel expense $ 138.8 $ 116.5 19.1 NM = Not meaningful The 19.3% increase in consumption was driven by the return of all nine CRJ-700s from Frontier JetExpress and the introduction of several new Q400s into the fleet, replacing smaller Q200s. Under the Frontier JetExpress arrangement, fuel was purchased by Frontier. The raw fuel price per gallon increased by 10% as a result of higher West Coast jet fuel prices driven by higher crude oil costs. During 2007, we recorded mark-to-market gains reflecting an increase in the value of our fuel hedge portfolio between December 31, 2006 and December 31, 2007. In 2006, we recorded a mark-to-market loss, as oil prices on December 31, 2006 were lower than they were a year earlier. 50 Table of Contents We realized gains of $8.5 million from settled hedge contracts in 2007, compared to $14.1 million in 2006. Our economic fuel expense is calculated as follows: (in millions, except per-gallon amounts) Year Ended December 31 2007 2006 % Change Raw fuel expense $ 156.2 $ 119.1 31.2 Less: cash received from settled hedges (8.5 ) (14.1 ) NM Economic fuel expense $ 147.7 $ 105.0 40.7 Fuel gallons consumed 64.8 54.3 19.3 Economic fuel cost per gallon $ 2.28 $ 1.93 18.1 NM = Not meaningful Like Alaska, our fuel hedge protection declined substantially in 2007 as the strike price of our hedges was closer to current oil prices compared to those in place during the previous two years. The total cash benefit from hedges that settled during the period declined to $8.5 million in 2007 from $14.1 million in 2006. Aircraft Maintenance Aircraft maintenance expense increased $18.1 million, or 24.5%, primarily as a result of a higher number of engine events, including scheduled events on our CRJ-700 engines. Aircraft Rent Aircraft rent declined by $3.7 million, or 5.3%, primarily as a result of the reduction in the number of leased Q200 aircraft in our operating fleet. These leased aircraft were replaced with new, owned Q400s during the year. Depreciation and Amortization Depreciation and amortization increased $15.4 million, or 83.2%, as a result of the 13 new Q400s that were delivered in 2007. We own all of these new aircraft. Fleet Transition Costs Fleet transition costs associated with the sublease of Q200 aircraft were $14.1 million in 2007 as a result of 11 Q200 aircraft that were delivered to a third party. Operating Costs per Available Seat Mile (CASM) As discussed above, operating costs per ASM (CASM) is an important metric in the industry and we use it to gauge the effectiveness of our cost-reduction efforts. Our operating costs per ASM are summarized below: Years Ended December 31 2007 2006 % Change Total operating expenses per ASM (CASM) 18.07 17.41 3.8 CASM includes the following components: Fuel costs per ASM 3.49 3.21 8.7 Fleet transition costs per ASM 0.35 NM CONSOLIDATED NONOPERATING INCOME (EXPENSE) Net nonoperating expense was $10.4 million in 2007 compared to $0.5 million in 2006. Interest income declined by $0.4 million compared to 2006, primarily as a result of a lower average cash and marketable securities balance, partially offset by higher average portfolio returns. Interest expense increased $10.0 million because of new debt arrangements in 2006 and 2007 and increases in the average interest rate on our variable-rate debt. This increase was offset by the conversion to equity of our $150 million senior convertible notes in April 2006, which eliminated further interest expense on those notes. Other-net increased $2.6 million, and includes a $3.75 million expense in 2007 associated with our investment in Row 44 given their early stage nature. Capitalized interest increased $3.1 million from 2006, resulting from an increase in pre-delivery deposits in connection with our orders for B737-800 and Bombardier Q400 aircraft. 51 Table of Contents CONSOLIDATED INCOME TAX EXPENSE (BENEFIT) Our consolidated effective income tax rate on income (loss) before income taxes for 2007 was 38.0% compared to an effective income tax rate of 40.0% in 2006. The effective rate for 2007 was positively impacted by $2.1 million in credits resulting from a favorable outcome of the state income tax matters referred to in Note 11. Excluding this benefit, our effective tax rate would have been 39.0%, which is different from our marginal 2007 tax rate of 37.4%. The difference is primarily due to the magnitude of nondeductible expenses, such as employee per-diem costs and stock-based compensation expense recorded for certain stock awards. The 2006 year includes $5.5 million of tax benefits associated with the reduction of certain tax contingency accruals for periods for which the statute of limitations expired in 2006. Excluding this benefit, our effective tax benefit rate for 2006 would have been 33.8%. CRITICAL ACCOUNTING ESTIMATES The discussion and analysis of our financial position and results of operations in this MD&A is based upon our consolidated financial statements. The preparation of these financial statements requires us to make estimates and judgments that affect our financial position and results of operations. See Note 1 to the consolidated financial statements for a description of our significant accounting policies. Critical accounting estimates are defined as those that are reflective of significant judgment and uncertainties, and that potentially may result in materially different results under varying assumptions and conditions. Management has identified the following critical accounting estimates and has discussed the development, selection and disclosure of these policies with our audit committee. MILEAGE PLAN Our Mileage Plan loyalty program awards miles to member passengers who fly on Alaska or Horizon and our many travel partners. Additionally, we sell miles to third parties, such as our bank partner, for cash. In either case, the outstanding miles may be redeemed for travel on Alaska, Horizon or any of our alliance partners. As long as the Mileage Plan is in existence, we have an obligation to provide this future travel. For awards earned by passengers who fly on Alaska, Horizon or our travel partners, we recognize a liability and the corresponding selling expense for this future obligation. For miles sold to third parties, the majority of the sales proceeds are recorded as deferred revenue and recognized when the award transportation is provided. The commission component of these sales proceeds (defined as the proceeds we receive from the sale of mileage credits minus the amount we defer) is recorded as other-net revenue when the cash is received. The deferred revenue is recognized as passenger revenue when awards are issued and flown on Alaska or Horizon, and as other-net revenue for awards issued and flown on partner airlines. At December 31, 2008, we had approximately 113 billion miles outstanding, resulting in an aggregate liability and deferred revenue balance of $690.4 million. Both the liability and the deferred revenue are determined based on several assumptions that require significant management judgment to estimate and formulate. There are uncertainties inherent in estimates; therefore, an incorrect assumption could greatly affect the amount and/or timing of revenue recognition or Mileage Plan expenses. The most significant assumptions in accounting for the Mileage Plan are described below. 1. The rate at which we defer sales proceeds from sold miles: We defer an amount that represents our estimate of the fair value of a free travel award by looking to the sales prices of comparable paid travel. As fare levels change, our deferral rate changes, which may result in the recognition of a higher or lower portion of the cash proceeds from the sale of miles as commission revenue in any given quarter. For example, due to the year-over-year increases in average ticket prices, our deferral rate increased in 2008, resulting in lower commission revenue and an increase in the amount of revenue deferred for miles sold. Holding all other 52 Table of Contents assumptions constant, an additional 1% increase in the deferral rate would have reduced our 2008 commission revenue by approximately $2.6 million. 2. The number of miles that will not be redeemed for travel (breakage): Members may not reach the mileage threshold necessary for a free ticket, and outstanding miles may not always be redeemed for travel. Therefore, based on the number of Mileage Plan accounts and the miles in the accounts, we estimate how many miles will never be used ( breakage ), and do not record a liability for those miles. Our estimates of breakage consider activity in our members accounts, account balances, and other factors. We believe our breakage assumptions are reasonable in light of historical experience and future expectations. A hypothetical 1.0% change in our estimate of breakage (currently 12% in the aggregate) has approximately a $7.3 million effect on the liability. Actual breakage could differ significantly from our estimates. 3. The number of miles used per award (i.e., free ticket): We estimate how many miles will be used per award. For example, our members may redeem credit for free travel to various locations or choose between a highly restricted award and an unrestricted award. If actual miles used are more or less than estimated, we may need to adjust the liability and corresponding expense. Our estimates are based on the current requirements in our Mileage Plan program and historical redemptions on Alaska, Horizon or other airlines. 4. The number of awards redeemed for travel on Alaska or Horizon versus other airlines: The cost for Alaska or Horizon to carry an award passenger is typically lower than the cost we will pay to other airlines. We estimate the number of awards that will be redeemed on Alaska or Horizon versus on other airlines and accrue the estimated costs based on historical redemption patterns. If the number of awards redeemed on other airlines is higher or lower than estimated, we may need to adjust our liability and corresponding expense. 5. The costs that will be incurred to provide award travel: When a frequent flyer travels on his or her award ticket on Alaska or Horizon, incremental costs such as food, fuel and insurance are incurred to carry that passenger. We estimate what these costs will be (excluding any contribution to overhead and profit) and accrue a liability. If the passenger travels on another airline on an award ticket, we often must pay the other airline for carrying the passenger. The other airline costs are based on negotiated agreements and are often substantially higher than the costs we would incur to carry that passenger. We estimate how much we will pay to other airlines for future travel awards based on historical redemptions and settlements with other carriers and accrue a liability accordingly. The costs actually incurred by us or paid to other airlines may be higher or lower than the costs that were estimated and accrued, and therefore we may need to adjust our liability and recognize a corresponding expense. We review significant Mileage Plan assumptions each quarter and change our assumptions if facts and circumstances indicate that a change is necessary. Any such change in assumptions could have a significant effect on our financial position and results of operations. PENSION PLANS We account for the defined-benefit pension plans using SFAS No. 158, Employers Accounting for Defined Benefit Pension and Other Postretirement Plans, an amendment of FASB Statements No. 87, 88, 106 and 132(R) (SFAS 158). SFAS 158 requires recognition of the overfunded or underfunded status of an entity defined-benefit pension and other postretirement plan as an asset or liability in the financial 53 Table of Contents statements and requires recognition of the funded status in other comprehensive income. Under SFAS No. 158, pension expense is recognized on an accrual basis over employees approximate service periods and is generally independent of funding decisions or requirements. We recognized expense for our qualified defined-benefit pension plans of $48.0 million, $62.6 million, and $78.3 million in 2008, 2007, and 2006, respectively. We expect the 2009 expense to be significantly higher as a result of the substantial decline in the market value of the plan assets in 2008. The calculation of pension expense and the corresponding liability requires the use of a number of important assumptions, including the expected long-term rate of return on plan assets and the assumed discount rate. Changes in these assumptions can result in different expense and liability amounts, and future actual experience can differ from these assumptions. Pension expense increases as the expected rate of return on pension plan assets decreases. As of December 31, 2008, we estimate that the pension plan assets will generate a long-term rate of return of 7.75%. This rate was developed using historical data, the current value of the underlying assets, as well as long-term inflation assumptions. We regularly review the actual asset allocation and periodically rebalance investments as appropriate. This expected long-term rate of return on plan assets at December 31, 2008 is based on an allocation of U.S. and non-U.S. equities and U.S. fixed income securities. Decreasing the expected long-term rate of return by 0.5% (from 7.75% to 7.25%) would increase our estimated 2009 pension expense by approximately $3.3 million. Pension liability and future pension expense increase as the discount rate is reduced. We discounted future pension obligations using a rate of 6.20% and 6.00% at December 31, 2008 and 2007, respectively. The discount rate at December 31, 2008 was determined using current rates earned on high-quality long-term bonds with maturities that correspond with the estimated cash distributions from the pension plans. Decreasing the discount rate by 0.5% (from 6.20% to 5.70%) would increase our projected benefit obligation at December 31, 2008 by approximately $78.9 million and increase estimated 2009 pension expense by approximately $8.8 million. With the exception of the plan covering Alaska pilots, all of our defined-benefit pension plans are closed to new entrants. Future changes in plan asset returns, assumed discount rates and various other factors related to the participants in our pension plans will impact our future pension expense and liabilities. We cannot predict what these factors will be in the future. LONG-LIVED ASSETS As of December 31, 2008, we had approximately $3.2 billion of property and equipment and related assets, net of accumulated depreciation. In accounting for these long-lived assets, we make estimates about the expected useful lives of the assets, changes in fleet plans, the expected residual values of the assets, and the potential for impairment based on the fair value of the assets and the cash flows they generate. Factors indicating potential impairment include, but are not limited to, significant decreases in the market value of the long-lived assets, management decisions regarding the future use of the assets, a significant change in the long-lived assets condition, and operating cash flow losses associated with the use of the long-lived asset. In 2006, we recorded an impairment charge totaling $131.1 million to write down our MD-80 fleet to its estimated fair market value, resulting from our decision to exit the fleet earlier than originally planned. Additionally, we bought five MD-80 aircraft from lessors and terminated the leases for those five aircraft. The total purchase price for the five aircraft was $80.9 million, including assumed debt of $11.6 million. Immediately upon purchase of the aircraft, we evaluated impairment and concluded that the carrying value was not recoverable. As a result, we recorded an additional $58.4 million charge in the third quarter of 2006 for the impairment. See Note 2 in the consolidated financial statements for further discussion about the impairment of the MD-80s. 54 Table of Contents In 2007, Horizon announced plans to phase out its remaining leased Q200 aircraft and is actively remarketing the remaining six leased operating aircraft. All of these aircraft are leased under operating lease agreements. As a result of this decision, we reassessed the depreciable lives and salvage values of the related rotable and repairable Q200 parts and, as such, we have now depreciated these parts down to their estimated salvage value. We are in the process of disposing of these parts. In 2008, Horizon announced plans to exit its CRJ-700 fleet as soon as possible, dependent on the ability to remarket the aircraft. As a result of the decision, we determined that the two owned CRJ-700s were impaired and recorded an impairment charge on the aircraft and their related spare parts of $5.5 million in 2008 to reduce the carrying value of these assets to their estimated fair value. We have reassessed the depreciable lives and salvage values of the two owned aircraft and the related spare parts and are depreciating those assets over their remaining estimated useful lives. There is inherent risk in estimating the fair value of our aircraft and related parts and their salvage values at the time of impairment. Actual proceeds upon disposition of the aircraft or related parts could be materially less than expected, resulting in additional loss. Our estimate of salvage value at the time of disposal could also change, requiring us to increase the depreciation expense on the affected aircraft. PROSPECTIVE ACCOUNTING PRONOUNCEMENTS In December 2007, the Financial Accounting Standards Board (FASB) issued Statement of Financial Standards (SFAS) No. 141R, Business Combinations , and SFAS No. 160, Noncontrolling Interests in Consolidated Financial Statements. These standards were issued jointly and will require most identifiable assets, liabilities, noncontrolling interests, and goodwill acquired in a business combination to be recorded at full fair value and will require noncontrolling interests (previously referred to as minority interests) to be reported as a component of equity, which changes the accounting for transactions with noncontrolling interest holders. Both statements are effective for fiscal years beginning on or after December 15, 2008. SFAS No. 141R will be applied only to acquisitions subsequent to the effective date and SFAS No. 160 will be applied prospectively to all noncontrolling interests, including any that arose before the effective date. We do not expect these statements to have a significant impact on our financial position, results of operations, or cash flows. In March 2008, the FASB issued SFAS No. 161, Disclosures about Derivative Instruments and Hedging Activities an amendment of FASB Statement No. 133 . SFAS 161 requires entities that use derivative instruments to provide certain qualitative disclosures about their objectives and strategies for using such instruments, amounts and location of the derivatives in the financial statements, among other disclosures. SFAS 161 is effective for fiscal years and interim periods beginning after November 15, 2008, with early application encouraged. Because of the importance and prominence of the Company fuel-hedging program, management believes that the current disclosures included in quarterly and annual filings include many of the disclosures required under SFAS 161. Therefore, we currently do not anticipate that the adoption of SFAS 161 will have a material impact on the disclosures already provided. In December 2008, the FASB issued Staff Position FAS 132(R)-1 amending SFAS 132(R), Employers Disclosures about Pensions and Other Postretirement Benefits , which, among other things, expands the disclosures regarding assets in an employer pension and postretirement benefit plans. The primary change would be to add the fair value hierarchy disclosures required by SFAS No. 157 as it relates to the underlying assets of the pension and postretirement benefit plans. The disclosures required by this position are effective for fiscal years ending after December 15, 2009. This position will only impact our financial statement disclosures and will have no impact on our financial position or results of operations. 55 Table of Contents LIQUIDITY AND CAPITAL RESOURCES Because of the current tumultuous economic environment and uncertain demand conditions, we continue to have a significant focus on preserving our liquidity position. In addition to the bank line-of-credit and pre-delivery payment facilities described below, other sources of liquidity may include financing other assets such as the 10 unencumbered aircraft in our fleet, aircraft parts, or receivables or a forward sale of mileage credits to our bank partner. We plan to sell up to four B737-700 aircraft in 2009 and we have agreements to complete sale-leaseback financing for six B737-800 by the end of February 2009. The sale-leaseback transactions are expected to result in gross proceeds of $231 million. The current economic environment is hindering the remarketing effort for the B737-700 aircraft and there is no assurance that we will be able to sell these aircraft at an acceptable price. We believe that our current cash and marketable securities of $1.1 billion combined with future cash flows from operations and other sources of liquidity will fund our operations for the foreseeable future. In our cash and marketable securities portfolio, we invest only in U.S. government securities, asset-backed obligations and corporate debt securities. We do not invest in equities or auction-rate securities. As of December 31, 2008, our net unrealized loss on our $1.1 billion cash and marketable securities balance was $4.0 million. Our overall investment strategy for our marketable securities portfolio has a primary goal of maintaining and securing its investment principal. Our investment portfolio is managed by reputable financial institutions and continually reviewed to ensure that the investments are aligned with our strategy. The table below presents the major indicators of financial condition and liquidity. (In millions, except per-share and debt-to-capital amounts) December 31, 2008 December 31, 2007 Change Cash and marketable securities $ 1,077.4 $ 822.8 $ 254.6 Long-term debt, net of current portion 1,596.3 1,124.6 471.7 Shareholders equity 661.9 1,025.4 (363.5 ) Long-term debt-to-capital assuming aircraft operating leases are capitalized at seven times annualized rent 81%:19 % 70%:30 % (11) pts During the year ended December 31, 2008, our cash and marketable securities increased $254.6 million to $1.1 billion. The following discussion summarizes the primary drivers of the increase and our expectation of future cash requirements. ANALYSIS OF OUR CASH FLOWS Cash Provided by Operating Activities During 2008, net cash provided by operating activities was $164.3 million, compared to $482.0 million during 2007. The decline of $317.7 million was primarily driven by a $277.6 million increase in economic fuel costs, which approximates the actual cash paid for fuel during the period. Furthermore, we had a $44 million difference in the timing of cash payments received from customers for future travel and we had cash outlays of approximately $156 million of premium cost for new fuel-hedge contracts in 2008 compared to only $17 million in 2007. These declines in operating cash flow were partially offset by the $156.6 million increase in operating revenues in 2008. We typically generate positive cash flows from operations, but anticipate consuming substantially all of that cash plus additional debt proceeds for capital expenditures and debt payments in 2009. Cash Used in Investing Activities Our investing activities are primarily made up of capital expenditures associated with our fleet transitions and, to a lesser extent, purchases 56 Table of Contents and sales of marketable securities. Cash used in investing activities was $581.3 million during 2008, compared to $601.8 million in 2007. Our capital expenditures declined by $421.6 million as a result of the purchase of 11 B737-800s and two Q400s in 2008, versus the purchase of 14 B737-800s and 13 Q400s in 2007. This amount was partially offset by the return of $80 million of pre-delivery payments from Boeing resulting from the delay in aircraft deliveries. We currently expect capital expenditures to be approximately $455 million (of which $405 million is expected to be aircraft-related) during 2009 as we take delivery of ten new B737-800s and five new Q400s. Capital expenditures are expected to decrease significantly in 2010 as we near the end of our committed firm aircraft deliveries. We do have a number of options for both B737-800 and Q400 aircraft available should we decide to convert those into firm commitments. However, a decision to exercise those options is highly dependent on our ability to deploy those new aircraft profitably and generate returns that exceed our cost of capital. Cash Provided by Financing Activities We finance a large portion of our capital spending with debt financing. Net cash provided by financing activities was $495.8 million during 2008 compared to $93.4 million during 2007. We obtained debt financing for 12 B737-800 aircraft and 15 Q400 aircraft during 2008 as we endeavored to increase our cash and marketable securities portfolio to help sustain us through the period of significantly high fuel prices and to prepare us for the current economic environment. We also borrowed $194.9 million on our pre-delivery payment facility during the year and drew down $75 million on our bank line of credit facility. Offsetting the borrowings were $343.2 million of debt payments and the repurchase of $48.9 million of our common stock as part of our common stock repurchase program. We plan to meet our significant capital and operating commitments through internally generated funds from operations and cash and marketable securities on hand, along with additional debt financing and proceeds from our pre-delivery payment facility. We have financing already in place for deliveries of our Q400s through 2010 and we are actively pursuing financing alternatives for the B737-800 deliveries, including sale-leaseback transactions or traditional debt financing. Given the current distress in the financial markets, we may not be able to obtain financing with terms that are acceptable. Bank Line-of-Credit Facility Alaska has a $185 million variable-rate credit facility that expires in March 2010. As of December 31, 2008, $75 million is outstanding on this credit facility, which is classified as current long-term debt in the consolidated balance sheet. On September 24, 2008, we entered into the Fourth Amendment to the credit facility that eliminated all previous financial covenants and replaced them with a requirement to maintain a minimum unrestricted cash and marketable securities balance of $500 million. See Note 6 in the consolidated financial statements for further discussion. Pre-delivery Payment Facility Alaska $172 million variable-rate revolving loan facility is available to provide a portion of the pre-delivery funding requirements of Alaska purchase of Boeing 737-800 aircraft under the current aircraft purchase agreement. The maximum available amount is reduced to $152 million beginning in August 2009. The facility expires on August 31, 2011. The interest rate is based on one-month LIBOR plus a specified margin. Borrowings are secured by Alaska rights under the Boeing purchase agreement. The principal amounts outstanding on the facility relate to specified aircraft and will be repaid when Alaska takes delivery of the aircraft, if not sooner. As of December 31, 2008, $39.9 million was outstanding under this facility, all of which is classified as current portion of long-term debt in our consolidated balance sheets. 57 Table of Contents CONTRACTUAL OBLIGATIONS, COMMITMENTS AND OFF-BALANCE SHEET ARRANGEMENTS Aircraft Purchase Commitments At December 31, 2008, we had firm orders to purchase 33 aircraft requiring future aggregate payments of approximately $753.4 million, as set forth below. Alaska has options to acquire 45 additional B737s and Horizon has options to acquire ten Q400s. In addition to aircraft purchased during 2008 as previously discussed, Alaska took delivery of one B737-800 aircraft under an operating lease arrangement. The following table summarizes aircraft purchase commitments and payments by year, as of December 31, 2008: Aircraft Delivery Period - Firm Orders 2009 2010 2011 Total Boeing 737-800 10 6 4 20 Bombardier Q400 5 7 1 13 Total 15 13 5 33 Payments (Millions)* $ 406.6 $ 273.6 $ 73.2 $ 753.4 * Includes pre-delivery payments to Boeing and Bombardier as well as final aircraft payments. Three of the B737-800 aircraft and two of the Q400 aircraft were delivered subsequent to December 31, 2008, but before the filing of this Form 10-K. These aircraft were paid for with cash on hand, but are expected to be financed with long-term debt or sale-leaseback arrangements. The remaining aircraft scheduled for delivery in 2009 are expected to be delivered in the first six months of the year. Because of our capacity reduction plans and the uncertainty around the ultimate disposal of Horizon CRJ-700 fleet, we have deferred Q400 deliveries from 2009 into 2010 and 2011. Due to the Boeing mechanics strike in 2008, five of our expected 2008 B737-800 deliveries were delayed to 2009 and one of our 2009 deliveries was delayed to 2010. Our working relationships with Boeing and Bombardier have historically allowed us to renegotiate aircraft delivery schedules under certain circumstances, specifically the recent deferral of Q400 deliveries at Horizon. We believe our relationship with these suppliers will continue to allow us some flexibility with aircraft deliveries in the future should we need to adjust our capacity plans. Contractual Obligations The following table provides a summary of our principal payments under current and long-term debt obligations, operating lease commitments, aircraft purchase commitments and other obligations as of December 31, 2008. Beyond (in millions) 2009 2010 2011 2012 2013 2013 Total Current and long-term debt obligations (excluding the pre-delivery payment facility) $ 205.0 $ 137.3 $ 172.2 $ 216.5 $ 175.4 $ 894.9 $ 1,801.3 Current and long-term portions of the pre-delivery payment facility 39.9 39.9 Operating lease commitments (1) 236.8 221.8 183.6 184.7 127.8 399.9 1,354.6 Aircraft purchase commitments 406.6 273.6 73.2 753.4 Interest obligations (2) 103.8 94.7 86.0 74.8 60.6 192.9 612.8 Other obligations (3)(4) 60.1 65.3 51.9 52.2 42.2 54.3 326.0 Total $ 1,052.2 $ 792.7 $ 566.9 $ 528.2 $ 406.0 $ 1,542.0 $ 4,888.0 (1) Operating lease commitments generally include aircraft operating leases, airport property and hangar leases, office space, and other equipment leases. The aircraft operating leases include lease obligations for four leased MD-80 aircraft, all of which we retired earlier than expected in connection with our fleet transition plan. We have accrued for these leases based on their discounted future cash flows and we remain obligated under the existing lease contracts on these aircraft. (2) For variable-rate debt, future obligations are shown above using interest rates in effect as of December 31, 2008. (3) Includes minimum obligations under our long-term power-by-the-hour maintenance agreements for all B737 engines other than the B737-800. (4) Excludes $23.7 million of unrecognized tax benefits for which we cannot make a reasonably reliable estimate of the amount and period of payment. See Note 11 to the consolidated financial statements. 58 Table of Contents Pension Obligations The table above excludes contributions to our various pension plans, which could be approximately $45 million to $75 million per year based on our historical funding practice, although there is no minimum required contribution in 2009. In addition, recent market performance resulted in a decline in the fair value of plan assets and an increase in the unfunded liability for our qualified defined-benefit pension plans to $444.9 million at December 31, 2008. This results in a 59.4% funded status on a projected benefit obligation basis compared to 86.2% funded as of December 31, 2007. Credit Card Agreements We have agreements with a number of credit card companies to process the sale of tickets and other services. Under these agreements, there are material adverse change clauses that, if triggered, could result in the credit card companies holding back a reserve from our credit card receivables. Under one such agreement, we could be required to maintain a reserve if our credit rating is downgraded to or below a rating specified by the agreement. We are not currently required to maintain any reserve under these agreements, but if we were, our financial position and liquidity could be materially harmed. EFFECT OF INFLATION AND PRICE CHANGES Inflation and price changes other than for aircraft fuel do not have a significant effect on our operating revenues, operating expenses and operating income. OTHER We strive to provide a return to our investors that exceeds the cost of the capital employed in our business. Our targeted return on invested capital (ROIC) is 10%. We have not historically reached this threshold, nor did we in 2008 or 2007. However, our strategic plan is built on the premise of providing an appropriate return to all capital providers.
