Item 7. Management Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations OVERVIEW The following discussion and analysis is intended to help you understand us, our operations and our financial performance. It should be read in conjunction with our consolidated financial statements and the accompanying notes, which are included elsewhere in this report. We are one of the largest apparel companies in the world, with a heritage dating back over 130 years. Our brand portfolio consists of nationally and internationally recognized brand names, including our own brands - Calvin Klein, Tommy Hilfiger, Van Heusen, IZOD, ARROW and Bass and our licensed brands - Geoffrey Beene , Kenneth Cole New York , Kenneth Cole Reaction , MICHAEL Michael Kors , Sean John , Chaps , Donald J. Trump Signature Collection , JOE Joseph Abboud , DKNY , Ike Behar and John Varvatos, as well as certain other licensed and various private label brands. Our revenue reached a record $5.891 billion in 2011, approximately 40% of which was generated internationally. Our global designer lifestyle brands, Tommy Hilfiger and Calvin Klein , together generated approximately 70% of our revenue during 2011. Our business strategy is to manage and market a portfolio of nationally and internationally recognized brands at multiple price points and across multiple channels of distribution. We believe this strategy reduces our reliance on any one demographic group, merchandise preference, distribution channel or geographic region. We have enhanced this strategy by expanding our portfolio of brands through acquisitions of leading renowned designer brands, such as Calvin Klein (February 28 2003) and Tommy Hilfiger (May 2010), that offer additional geographic distribution channel and price point opportunities in our areas of established expertise, dress shirts and sportswear. A significant portion of our total income is derived from international sources, which, prior to the acquisition of Tommy Hilfiger, had been primarily driven by the international component of our Calvin Klein licensing business. The Calvin Klein acquisition enhanced our business strategy by providing us with an established international licensing business, which does not require working capital investments. We have successfully pursued growth opportunities through disciplined extension of the Calvin Klein brands by launching our outlet retail and men sportswear operations in North America and by licensing the brands for additional product categories and geographic areas. We believe that the acquisition of Tommy Hilfiger has advanced our business strategy by adding a designer lifestyle brand with global growth opportunities and by establishing an international platform in Europe that is a strategic complement to our strong North American presence and provides us with the resources and expertise needed to grow our brands and businesses internationally. We have a division managed by a team of Tommy Hilfiger executives based in Amsterdam whose purposes include pursuing international opportunities for our brands. We recently announced that we will be exercising our rights to reacquire the existing license agreements held by affiliates of The Warnaco Group, Inc. for the distribution and sale of apparel and accessories and the operation of retail stores in Europe under the ck Calvin Klein brand. We will commence our operations in 2013. We believe that this represents a significant opportunity to invest in the global potential of the Calvin Klein brand, as we plan to leverage Tommy Hilfiger established European platform to accelerate the growth of this business. We paid $2.5 billion in cash through the incurrence of indebtedness and issued 7.9 million shares of our common stock as consideration for the Tommy Hilfiger acquisition, for total consideration of approximately $3.0 billion. We made approximately $450 million in debt payments in 2011, for a total of approximately $700 million in payments since the closing of the acquisition. The majority of these payments were voluntary. We plan to continue to strengthen our balance sheet through deleveraging and effective working capital management. We believe that our persistent focus on and enhancement of our business strategies and our balance sheet strength will allow us to continue to invest in our businesses and capitalize on opportunities for future growth. RESULTS OF OPERATIONS Operations Overview We generate net sales from (i) the wholesale distribution to wholesale customers and franchise, licensee and distributor operated stores of men dress shirts and neckwear, men and women sportswear, footwear, accessories and related products; and (ii) the sale through over 1,000 company-operated retail locations worldwide of apparel, footwear, accessories and other products under our Calvin Klein, Tommy Hilfiger, Van Heusen, IZOD and Bass trademarks. We generate royalty, advertising and other revenue from fees for licensing the use of our trademarks. Calvin Klein royalty, advertising and other revenue, which comprised 79% of total royalty, advertising and other revenue in 2011, is derived across various regions under licenses and other arrangements for a broad array of products, including jeans, underwear, fragrances, eyewear, footwear, women apparel, outerwear, watches and home furnishings, offered under our Calvin Klein brands. Gross profit on total revenue is total revenue less cost of goods sold. Included as cost of goods sold are costs associated with the production and procurement of product, including inbound freight costs, purchasing and receiving costs, inspection costs and other product procurement related charges. All of our royalty, advertising and other revenue is included in gross profit because there is no cost of goods sold associated with such revenue. As a result, our gross profit may not be comparable to that of other entities. We completed the acquisition of Tommy Hilfiger in the second quarter of 2010. We recorded pre-tax charges in 2010 in connection with the acquisition and integration of Tommy Hilfiger that totaled $338.3 million, which included: (i) a loss of $140.5 million associated with hedges against Euro to United States dollar exchange rates relating to the purchase price; (ii) short-lived non-cash valuation amortization charges of $76.8 million, which became fully amortized during 2010; and (iii) transaction, integration, restructuring and debt extinguishment costs of $121.0 million. We incurred pre-tax charges of $69.5 million during 2011 in connection with the integration and the related restructuring, including product exit charges. We expect to incur additional pre-tax charges of approximately $30.0 million during 2012 in connection with the continued integration and the related restructuring. 29 We exited in the fourth quarter of 2010 our United Kingdom and Ireland Van Heusen dresswear and accessories business. We recorded in 2010 pre-tax charges in connection with this exit of $6.6 million, which consists principally of non-cash charges. We amended and restated our senior secured credit facility in the first quarter of 2011. We recorded debt modification costs of $16.2 million in connection with this transaction. Please see the section entitled Liquidity and Capital Resources below for a further discussion. We negotiated during the second quarter of 2011 the early termination of our license to market sportswear under the Timberland brand and will be exiting the business in 2012. We also announced during the fourth quarter of 2011 that we will be exiting the Izod women wholesale sportswear business beginning in 2012. We incurred pre-tax charges of $8.1 million during 2011 in connection with these two initiatives. We reacquired during the third quarter of 2011 the rights in India to the Tommy Hilfiger trademarks that had been subject to a perpetual license. We paid $25.0 million as consideration for this transaction. In connection with the transaction, we were required to record an expense of $20.7 million due to the settlement of an unfavorable contract as a result of a pre-existing relationship with the licensee, as the license provided favorable terms to the licensee. Please see the section entitled Liquidity and Capital Resources below for a further discussion. We entered into agreements during 2011 to reacquire from a licensee, prior to the expiration of the license, the rights to distribute Tommy Hilfiger brand tailored apparel in Europe and acquire an outlet store from the licensee. The transfer of the rights and store ownership will be effective December 31, 2012. Under these agreements, we made a payment of $9.6 million (based on the applicable exchange rate in effect on the payment date) to the licensee during the fourth quarter of 2011 and are required to make an additional payment of approximately $25.0 million (which is subject to change based on the applicable exchange rate in effect on the payment date) to the licensee in the fourth quarter of 2012. Please see the section entitled Liquidity and Capital Resources below for a further discussion. The following table summarizes our income statements in 2011, 2010 and 2009: 2011 2010 2009 (dollars in millions) Net sales $ 5,410.0 $ 4,219.7 $ 2,070.8 Royalty revenue 356.0 306.7 239.3 Advertising and other revenue 124.6 110.4 88.7 Total revenue 5,890.6 4,636.8 2,398.7 Gross profit 3,055.9 2,422.0 1,182.6 % of total revenue 51.9 % 52.2 % 49.3 % Selling, general and administrative expenses 2,481.4 2,071.4 938.8 % of total revenue 42.1 % 44.7 % 39.1 % Debt modification and extinguishment costs 16.2 6.7 Other loss 140.5 Equity in income of unconsolidated affiliates 1.4 Income before interest and taxes 559.7 203.4 243.8 Interest expense 129.4 128.6 33.5 Interest income 1.3 1.7 1.3 Income before taxes 431.6 76.6 211.6 Income tax expense 113.7 22.8 49.7 Net income $ 317.9 $ 53.8 $ 161.9 30 Total Revenue Our net sales were $5.410 billion in 2011, $4.220 billion in 2010 and $2.071 billion in 2009. The 2011 net sales increase of $1.190 billion as compared to 2010 net sales was due principally to the effect of the following items: The addition of $433.7 million and $267.6 million of first quarter net sales in our Tommy Hilfiger International and Tommy Hilfiger North America segments, respectively, as the acquisition was not completed until the second quarter of 2010. The addition of $262.2 million and $116.6 million, attributable to second through fourth quarter growth in the Tommy Hilfiger International and Tommy Hilfiger North America segments, respectively. This increase was driven by low double-digit growth in the European wholesale division, combined with retail comparable store sales growth of 10% and 14% for our Tommy Hilfiger International and Tommy Hilfiger North America retail businesses, respectively. Also contributing to the revenue increase was a net benefit of approximately $55 million in our Tommy Hilfiger International segment from year-over-year foreign exchange rate changes versus the United States dollar in 2011 as compared to 2010. The addition of $85.1 million of net sales attributable to growth in our Other (Calvin Klein Apparel) segment, as our Calvin Klein outlet retail business posted a 16% increase in comparable store sales in 2011 and the wholesale business experienced low double-digit growth. The addition of $41.0 million of sales attributable to growth in our Heritage Brand Wholesale Dress Furnishings segment. The addition of $7.9 million of sales attributable to growth in our Heritage Brand Retail segment, due principally to a 2% increase in retail comparable stores sales in 2011. The addition of $7.5 million of net sales attributable to growth in our Calvin Klein Licensing segment. The reduction of $31.2 million of sales attributable to our Heritage Brand Wholesale Sportswear segment, which was driven particularly by decreases in the Izod division and the soon-to-be exited Timberland division. The 2010 net sales increase of $2.149 billion as compared to 2009 net sales was due principally to the effect of the following items: The addition of $1.008 billion and $889.6 million of net sales attributable to our Tommy Hilfiger International and Tommy Hilfiger North America segments, respectively, as a result of the acquisition of Tommy Hilfiger early in the second quarter of 2010. The addition of $129.4 million of combined net sales attributable to growth in our Heritage Brand Wholesale Dress Furnishings and Heritage Brand Wholesale Sportswear segments resulting from better performance across almost all brands, with Van Heusen performing particularly well. The addition of $88.0 million of net sales attributable to growth in our Other (Calvin Klein Apparel) segment, as both our Calvin Klein wholesale and retail divisions exhibited strong growth during 2010. Comparable store sales in our Calvin Klein outlet retail division increased 13% in 2010. The addition of $28.6 million of net sales attributable to growth in our Heritage Brand Retail segment. This was principally driven by an overall comparable store sales increase of 8%. The addition of $5.6 million of net sales attributable to growth in our Calvin Klein Licensing segment. Royalty, advertising and other revenue was $480.6 million in 2011 as compared to $417.1 million in 2010. Of this $63.5 million increase, $25.6 million was attributable to Tommy Hilfiger, due principally to the addition of first quarter royalty, advertising and other revenue, combined with second through fourth quarter increases due to growth in Central and South America and Asia, and strong performance in tailored apparel, fragrance and eyewear. Within the Calvin Klein Licensing segment, global licensee royalty revenue increased $28.1 million, or 11%, as compared to 2010 driven by growth across virtually all product categories and regions, with jeanswear, underwear, fragrance, footwear, accessories and women sportswear and dresses performing particularly well. Calvin Klein advertising and other revenue increased $11.1 million to $108.6 million in 2011 as compared to 2010, driven principally by the launch in the first quarter of 2011 of the global marketing campaign supporting the introduction of the new ck one lifestyle brand for jeanswear, underwear and fragrance. Such advertising and other revenue is generally collected and spent and, therefore, is presented as both a revenue and an expense within our income statement, with minimal net impact on earnings. Royalty, advertising and other revenue was $417.1 million in 2010 as compared to $328.0 million in 2009. Of the $89.1 million increase, $47.8 million was attributable to the acquisition of Tommy Hilfiger. Within the Calvin Klein Licensing segment, royalty revenue increased $26.0 million, or 12%, as compared to 2009 due to strong performance across virtually all 31 product categories, with jeanswear, underwear, fragrance, watches, women sportswear and dresses performing particularly well. In addition, advertising and other revenue increased $13.2 million for the Calvin Klein Licensing segment. Revenue in 2012 is currently projected to be relatively flat to up 2% as compared to 2011, including a negative impact of approximately 4%, of which approximately $150 million is attributable to projected differences in foreign currency translation (principally related to an expected weaker Euro to United States dollar exchange rate) and approximately $100 million is attributable to the 2012 exit from the Timberland and Izod women wholesale sportswear businesses. Revenue for the Tommy Hilfiger business is expected to be relatively flat to up 2% as compared to 2011, including a negative impact of approximately 5% due to projected differences in foreign currency translation. Revenue for the Calvin Klein business is expected to grow 5% to 7% as compared to 2011. Calvin Klein royalty revenue is expected to be negatively impacted by projected differences in foreign currency translation, our upcoming reacquisition of the license for ck Calvin Klein apparel and accessories in Europe as discussed above, challenging business conditions for our licensees in Europe and a reduction in licensee selling of Calvin Klein branded products in secondary channels. Revenue for the Heritage Brand business is expected to decrease 3% to 4% as compared to 2011, including a negative impact of approximately 6% due to the exit of businesses as discussed above. Gross Profit on Total Revenue The following table shows our revenue mix between net sales and royalty, advertising and other revenue, as well as our gross profit as a percentage of total revenue for 2011, 2010 and 2009: 2011 2010 2009 Components of revenue: Net sales 91.8 % 91.0 % 86.3 % Royalty, advertising and other revenue 8.2 % 9.0 % 13.7 % Total 100.0 % 100.0 % 100.0 % Gross profit as a % of total revenue 51.9 % 52.2 % 49.3 % Gross profit on total revenue in 2011 was $3.056 billion, or 51.9% of total revenue, compared to $2.422 billion, or 52.2% of total revenue in 2010. Gross profit as a percentage of revenue decreased 30 basis points in 2011 as compared with 2010, due principally to (i) the negative impact of higher overall product costs in 2011, particularly in the second half of the year, and increased promotional selling during 2011 in our Izod and Timberland wholesale sportswear divisions; (ii) the negative impact of a change in revenue mix, as royalty, advertising and other revenue, which does not carry a cost of sales and has a gross profit percentage of 100%, decreased in 2011 as a percentage of total revenue; (iii) the positive impact of the absence in 2011 of $44.5 million of short-lived non-cash valuation amortization charges that were recorded during 2010 as a result of the Tommy Hilfiger acquisition; and (iv) the positive impact of owning Tommy Hilfiger for a full year in 2011, as Tommy Hilfiger gross profit rates are higher than our other non-licensing businesses. Gross profit as a percentage of total revenue increased 290 basis points in 2010 as compared with 2009, due principally to (i) the positive impact of the addition of Tommy Hilfiger, which has higher gross margin percentages as discussed above; (ii) the negative impact of the charges that were recorded in 2010 as a result of the Tommy Hilfiger acquisition, principally related to short-lived non-cash valuation amortization; and (iii) the negative impact of a change in revenue mix, as royalty, advertising and other revenue decreased as a percentage of total revenue. We currently expect that the gross profit percentage on total revenue in 2012 will increase as compared with 2011. While year-over-year product cost increases are expected to negatively impact the first half of 2012, product costs are expected to decline starting with product for the Fall 2012 season, which we will begin selling late in the second quarter of 2012. In addition, we expect to realize increased selling prices during 2012. We also expect an increase as we expect our Tommy Hilfiger businesses, which have higher gross margin percentages than our other non-licensing businesses, to increase as a percentage of our total revenue. Further, the planned 2012 exits of the Timberland and Izod women wholesale sportswear businesses, both of which have low gross margin percentages and underperformed in 2011, should increase our overall margin. 32 Selling, General and Administrative ( SG&A ) Expenses Our SG&A expenses were as follows: 2011 2010 2009 (dollars in millions) SG&A expenses $ 2,481.4 $ 2,071.4 $ 938.8 % of total revenue 42.1 % 44.7 % 39.1 % SG&A expenses in 2011 were $2.481 billion, or 42.1% of total revenue, as compared to $2.071 billion, or 44.7% of total revenue in 2010. The 260 basis point decrease in SG&A expenses as a percentage of total revenue was due primarily to leveraging of expenses. Also contributing to the decrease was a net decrease in one-time acquisition, integration and related restructuring costs. The costs of $90.7 million incurred in 2011 resulted from the continuing integration of Tommy Hilfiger and the related restructuring, the settlement of the unfavorable pre-existing license agreement in connection with our reacquisition of the rights to the Tommy Hilfiger trademarks in India that had been subject to a perpetual license, our negotiated early termination of our license to market sportswear under the Timberland brand and our 2012 exit of the Izod women wholesale sportswear business. These expenses were less than transaction, restructuring, short-lived non-cash valuation amortization and other charges of $150.6 million incurred in 2010 related to our acquisition and integration of Tommy Hilfiger and the exit from our United Kingdom and Ireland Van Heusen dresswear and accessories business. SG&A expenses in 2010 were $2.071 billion, or 44.7% of total revenue, as compared to $938.8 million, or 39.1% of total revenue in 2009. Included in the 560 basis point increase in SG&A expenses as a percentage of total revenue were $150.6 million of transaction, restructuring, short-lived non-cash valuation amortization and other charges related to our acquisition and integration of Tommy Hilfiger and costs associated with the exit from our United Kingdom and Ireland Van Heusen dresswear and accessories business. The remaining increase was principally attributable to Tommy Hilfiger large international presence, as international apparel businesses typically have higher SG&A expense percentages than domestic apparel businesses. In addition, the significant majority of Tommy Hilfiger North America operations consists of its retail business, and retail businesses typically have higher SG&A expense percentages than wholesale businesses. Also contributing to the SG&A expense percentage increase was an increase in advertising expenses related to our Calvin Klein and heritage brands. We currently expect that our SG&A expenses as a percentage of total revenue in 2012 will decrease as compared to 2011 due principally to reduced integration and restructuring costs associated with Tommy Hilfiger, combined with the absence of the above-mentioned settlement expense associated with our reacquisition of the rights in India to the Tommy Hilfiger trademarks, the termination of our Timberland license and our 2012 exit of the Izod women wholesale sportswear business. Partially offsetting this decrease is an expected increase in pension expense due in large part to a decrease in discount rates. Debt Modification Costs We incurred costs totaling $16.2 million during 2011 in connection with the amendment and restatement of our senior secured credit facility. Please refer to the section entitled Liquidity and Capital Resources below for a discussion of this transaction. Debt Extinguishment We incurred a loss of $6.7 million in 2010 on the extinguishment of our 7 1/4% senior notes due 2011 and our 8 1/8% senior notes due 2013. Please refer to the section entitled Liquidity and Capital Resources below for a discussion of the tender for, and redemption of, these notes. Other Loss We settled on May 6, 2010 1.550 billion of foreign currency forward exchange contracts, which we entered into in connection with the Tommy Hilfiger acquisition to hedge against our exposure to changes in the exchange rate for the Euro, as a portion of the acquisition purchase price was payable in cash and denominated in Euros. We recorded a pre-tax loss of $140.5 million during 2010 related to these contracts. 33 Equity in Income of Unconsolidated Affiliates The equity in income of unconsolidated affiliates of $1.4 million during 2011 relates to our share of income from our joint ventures in China and India for the Tommy Hilfiger brand, which are accounted for under the equity method of accounting. Please refer to the section entitled Liquidity and Capital Resources below for a further discussion of our investments in these joint ventures. Interest Expense and Interest Income Interest expense increased slightly to $129.4 million in 2011 from $128.6 million in 2010, principally as a result of the full year impact of our increased debt incurred related to the Tommy Hilfiger acquisition, mostly offset by the repayments of the debt, the majority of which were voluntary. We have made approximately $700 million of payments on the term loans since the acquisition date, approximately $450 million of which were made in 2011. Our amended and restated credit facility provides reduced borrowing spreads, as well as additional flexibility with respect to the application of voluntary prepayments. During the second quarter of 2011, we entered into interest rate swap and cap agreements for the intended purpose of reducing our exposure to interest rate volatility. Please refer to the section entitled Liquidity and Capital Resources below for a further discussion. Interest income decreased to $1.3 million in 2011 from $1.7 million in 2010 due principally to a decrease in our average cash position during the year. Interest expense increased to $128.6 million in 2010 from $33.5 million in 2009, principally as a result of the issuance during the second quarter of 2010 of $600.0 million of 7 3/8% senior notes due 2020 and term loans of $1.9 billion borrowed under a new credit facility, the net proceeds of which were used in connection with the Tommy Hilfiger acquisition. We made voluntary debt payments of $250.0 million on the term loans during 2010. Interest income increased to $1.7 million in 2010 from $1.3 million in 2009 due principally to an increase in our average cash position during 2010. Net interest expense for 2012 is currently expected to decrease to a range of $115 million to $117 million from $128.1 million in 2011, principally as a result of the impact of debt repayments we made in 2011, combined with additional repayments we expect to make in 2012. We currently plan on making approximately $300 million of additional debt payments on our term loans in the second half of 2012, the majority of which will be voluntary. Income Taxes Income tax expense was as follows: 2011 2010 2009 (dollars in millions) Income tax expense $ 113.7 $ 22.8 $ 49.7 Income tax expense as a % of pre-tax income 26.3 % 29.7 % 23.5 % The effective tax rate for 2011 was 26.3% compared with 29.7% in 2010. Our effective tax rate in 2011 was lower than the United States statutory tax rate primarily due to the benefit of the overall lower tax rates in international jurisdictions partially offset by foreign earnings taxed in the United States. The 2011 effective tax rate was also impacted by a tax benefit resulting from revaluing certain deferred tax liabilities in connection with a decrease in the statutory tax rate in Japan. Our effective tax rate of 29.7% in 2010 was lower than the United States statutory tax rate primarily due to the benefit of the overall lower tax rates in international jurisdictions partially offset by foreign earnings taxed in the United States. The 2010 effective tax rate was also impacted by a benefit resulting from the lapse of the statute of limitations with respect to previously unrecognized tax positions and a benefit from the reduction of the Netherlands tax rate in the fourth quarter from 25.5% to 25.0%. The 2010 effective tax rate was negatively impacted by the non-deductibility of certain costs, principally those associated with the Tommy Hilfiger acquisition. We currently anticipate that our 2012 effective tax rate will be between 23.5% and 24.0%. As compared to the United States statutory tax rate, the 2012 effective tax rate is expected to be lower as a result of being favorably impacted by growth in our international Tommy Hilfiger business, a significant portion of which is subject to favorable tax rates. This international growth is also expected to favorably impact the 2012 effective tax rate as compared to 2011. In addition, the 2012 effective tax rate is expected to be favorably impacted by the continuation of tax synergies resulting from the Tommy Hilfiger acquisition 34 and the elimination of the negative effect of foreign earnings taxed in the United States. It is possible that our estimated rate could change from the mix of international and domestic pre-tax earnings, or from discrete events arising from specific transactions, audits by tax authorities or the receipt of new information. LIQUIDITY AND CAPITAL RESOURCES Cash Flow Summary We experienced a reduction in cash of $265.5 million during 2011, including $450.7 million of debt repayments. Cash flow in 2012 will be impacted by various factors in addition to those noted below in this Liquidity and Capital Resources section, including the amount of debt repayments we make in 2012. Operations Cash provided by operating activities was $490.7 million in 2011, as compared to $359.2 million in 2010, due primarily to an increase in net income as adjusted to remove items related to investing or financing activities and noncash items. Investments in Unconsolidated Affiliates We formed a joint venture in China in 2011, in which we own a 45% equity interest. The joint venture assumed direct control of the Tommy Hilfiger wholesale and retail distribution business in China from the existing licensee, Dickson Concepts (International) Limited, on August 1, 2011. We made funding payments with respect to our 45% interest totaling $17.1 million during 2011. We completed the acquisition in 2011 from Ganesha Limited and Ganesha Brands Limited, both of which are affiliates of GVM International Limited ( GVM ), of a 50% equity interest in a company that has been renamed Tommy Hilfiger Arvind Fashion Private Limited ( TH India ), for $30.0 million. TH India was GVM sublicensee of the Tommy Hilfiger trademarks for apparel, footwear and handbags in India. As a result of the transaction, TH India is now the direct licensee of the trademarks for all categories (other than fragrance), operates a wholesale apparel, footwear and handbags business in connection with its license and sublicenses the trademarks for certain other product categories in the region. We made additional payments totaling $1.6 million to TH India during 2011 with respect to our 50% interest. Capital Expenditures Our capital expenditures in 2011 were $169.8 million compared to $101.0 million in 2010. This increase was due principally to the addition of first quarter spending in our Tommy Hilfiger business combined with investments in the Tommy Hilfiger business, particularly related to the expansion of international operations and in our corporate infrastructure to support our expanded operations. We currently expect capital expenditures in 2012 to be approximately $250 million, which includes a shift into 2012 of expenditures previously planned to be made in 2011. Acquisitions Reacquisition of Tommy Hilfiger Tailored Apparel License We entered into agreements during 2011 to reacquire from a licensee, prior to the expiration of the license, the rights to distribute Tommy Hilfiger brand tailored apparel in Europe and acquire an outlet store from the licensee. The transfer of the rights and store ownership will be effective December 31, 2012. Under these agreements, we made a payment of $9.6 million (based on the applicable exchange rate in effect on the payment date) to the licensee during the fourth quarter of 2011 and are required to make an additional payment of approximately $25.0 million to the licensee during 2012 (which amount may differ due to the actual exchange rate in effect on the payment date). Tommy Hilfiger India Perpetually Licensed Rights Reacquisition We reacquired in 2011 the rights in India to the Tommy Hilfiger trademarks that had been subject to a perpetual license previously granted to GVM. We paid $25.0 million during 2011 as consideration for the transaction. In addition, we are required to make annual contingent purchase price payments based on a percentage of annual sales over a certain threshold of 35 Tommy Hilfiger products in India for a period of five years (or, under certain circumstances, a period of six years) following the acquisition date. Such payments are subject to a $25.0 million aggregate maximum and are due within 60 days following each one year period. The first one year period commenced on July 1, 2011. In connection with the transaction, we recorded an expense of $20.7 million due to the settlement of an unfavorable contract as a result of a pre-existing relationship with the licensee, as the license provided favorable terms to the licensee. Reacquisition of Tommy Hilfiger Handbag License We entered into an agreement in 2010 to reacquire from a licensee, prior to the expiration of the license, the rights to distribute Tommy Hilfiger handbags outside of the United States. The effective date of the transfer of the rights was December 31, 2010. In connection with this transaction, we made a payment of $7.3 million, based on the applicable exchange rate in effect on the payment date, to the former licensee during the second quarter of 2010. Tommy Hilfiger Acquisition We completed our acquisition of Tommy Hilfiger on May 6, 2010. We paid $2.486 billion in cash and issued 7.9 million shares of our common stock, valued at $475.6 million, as consideration for the acquisition, for total consideration of approximately $3.0 billion. In addition, we entered into foreign currency forward exchange contracts to purchase 1.550 billion to hedge against our exposure to changes in the exchange rate for the Euro, as a portion of the cash component of the purchase price was denominated in Euros. We settled the foreign currency forward exchange contracts at a loss of $140.5 million on May 6, 2010 in connection with completing the acquisition. We funded the cash portion and related costs of the Tommy Hilfiger acquisition with cash on hand and the net proceeds of the following activities: (i) the sale of 5.8 million shares of our common stock; (ii) the issuances of an aggregate of 8,000 shares of Series A convertible preferred stock for an aggregate gross purchase price of $200.0 million; (iii) the issuance of $600.0 million of 7 3/8% senior notes due 2020; and (iv) the borrowing of $1.9 billion of term loans under new credit facilities. Please refer to the discussion below for further detail on these activities. Calvin Klein Contingent Purchase Price Payments In connection with our acquisition of Calvin Klein, we are obligated to pay Mr. Calvin Klein contingent purchase price payments based on 1.15% of total worldwide net sales (as defined in the agreement governing this acquisition, as amended) of products bearing any of the Calvin Klein brands with respect to sales made through February 12, 2018. A significant portion of the sales on which the payments to Mr. Klein are made are wholesale sales by us and our licensees and other partners to retailers. Such contingent purchase price payments totaled $50.7 million in 2011. We currently expect that such payments will be approximately $55 million in 2012. Common Stock Offering We sold 5.8 million shares of our common stock on April 28, 2010 for net proceeds, after commissions, discounts and related fees and expenses of $364.5 million, which were used to fund a portion of the purchase price for the Tommy Hilfiger acquisition. Series A Convertible Preferred Stock Issuance On May 6, 2010, we sold an aggregate of 8,000 shares of Series A convertible preferred stock, par value $100.00 per share, for an aggregate gross purchase price of $200.0 million. We received net proceeds of $188.6 million in connection with this issuance, which were used to fund a portion of the purchase price for the Tommy Hilfiger acquisition. The Series A convertible preferred stock has a liquidation preference of $25,000 per share and is convertible at a price of $47.74 into 4.2 million shares of common stock. The conversion price was established in a definitive agreement, which formed a binding commitment with the preferred stockholders in March 2010, and is subject to equitable adjustment in the event of us taking certain actions, including stock splits, stock dividends, mergers, consolidations or other capital reorganizations. The Series A convertible preferred stock is not subject to mandatory redemption nor is it redeemable, in whole or in part, by us at our option or that of any holder. The holders of the Series A convertible preferred stock are entitled to vote and participate in dividends with the holders of our common stock on an as-converted basis. 36 Dividends Our common stock currently pays annual dividends totaling $0.15 per share. Our Series A convertible preferred stock participates in common stock dividends on an as-converted basis. Dividends on common and preferred stock totaled $10.9 million for 2011. We currently project that cash dividends on our common and preferred stock in 2012 will be approximately $11.0 million based on our current dividend rate, the number of shares of our common and preferred stock outstanding at January 29, 2012 and our estimates of stock to be issued during 2012 under our stock incentive plans. Financing Arrangements Our capital structure was as follows: (in millions) January 29, 2012 January 30, 2011 Short-term borrowings $ 13.0 $ 4.9 Current portion of long-term debt 70.0 Capital lease obligations 26.8 24.9 Long-term debt 1,832.9 2,364.0 Stockholders equity 2,715.4 2,442.5 In addition, we had $233.2 million and $498.7 million of cash and cash equivalents as of January 29, 2012 and January 30, 2011, respectively. Short-Term Borrowings One of our subsidiaries has a Yen-denominated overdraft facility with a Japanese bank, which provides for borrowings of up to 1.000 billion ($13.0 million based on the Yen to United States dollar exchange rate in effect on January 29, 2012) and is utilized to fund working capital. Borrowings under the facility are unsecured and bear interest at the one month Japanese inter-bank borrowing rate ( TIBOR ) plus 0.15%. Such facility renews automatically unless we give notice of termination. The full amount of this facility was borrowed as of January 29, 2012. The weighted average interest rate on the funds borrowed at January 29, 2012 was 0.33%. The maximum amount of borrowings outstanding under this facility during the year ended January 29, 2012 was approximately $13.0 million. Capital Lease Obligations Our cash payments for capital lease obligations totaled $10.4 million in 2011. Tender for and Redemption of 2011 Notes and 2013 Notes We commenced tender offers on April 7, 2010 for (i) all of the $150.0 million outstanding principal amount of our notes due 2011; and (ii) all of the $150.0 million outstanding principal amount of our notes due 2013. The tender offers expired on May 4, 2010. On May 6, 2010, we accepted for purchase all of the notes tendered and made payment to tendering holders and called for redemption all of the balance of our outstanding 7 1/4% senior notes due 2011 and all of the balance of our outstanding 8 1/8% senior notes due 2013. The redemption prices of the notes due 2011 and 2013 were 100.000% and 101.354%, respectively, of the outstanding aggregate principal amount of the applicable note, plus accrued and unpaid interest thereon to the redemption date. On May 6, 2010, we made an irrevocable payment, including accrued and unpaid interest, to the trustee for the notes due 2011 and 2013. As a result, such indentures were satisfied and effectively discharged as of May 6, 2010. 7 3/8% Senior Notes Due 2020 Our $600.0 million 7 3/8% senior notes, which we issued on May 6, 2010, are due May 15, 2020. Interest on the 7 3/8% notes is payable semi-annually in arrears. 37 We may redeem some or all of these notes on or after May 15, 2015 at specified redemption prices. We may redeem some or all of these notes at any time prior to May 15, 2015 by paying a make whole premium. In addition, we may also redeem up to 35% of these notes prior to May 15, 2013, by paying a set premium, with the net proceeds of certain equity offerings. Senior Secured Credit Facility On May 6, 2010, we entered into and, on March 2, 2011, amended and restated our senior secured credit facility ( the amended facility ). The amended facility consists of a Euro-denominated term loan A facility, a United States dollar-denominated term loan A facility, a Euro-denominated term loan B facility, a United States dollar-denominated term loan B facility, a United States dollar-denominated revolving credit facility and two multi-currency (one United States dollar and Canadian dollar, and the other Euro, Japanese Yen and British Pound) revolving credit facilities. The amended facility provides reduced borrowing spreads, as well as additional flexibility with respect to the application of voluntary prepayments. The full benefit of the reduction in borrowing spreads is not expected to be realized due to the interest rate swap and cap agreements we entered into during the second quarter of 2011 for the intended purpose of reducing our exposure to interest rate volatility. Please refer to the discussion below for further detail on those agreements. By entering into the amended facility, we extended the maturity of the term loan A facilities and the revolving loan facilities from May 2015 to January 2016. The maturity of the term loan B facilities remained in May 2016. In connection with the closing of the amended facility, we voluntarily prepaid approximately $150 million of borrowings with cash on hand. We paid $10.6 million of fees in cash in connection with the modification of our senior secured credit facility in the first quarter of 2011. We made additional payments of approximately $300 million during 2011 for a total reduction of approximately $700 million of the amount initially borrowed at the time of the Tommy Hilfiger acquisition closing. The revolving credit facilities remained undrawn upon the closing of the amended facility (with only letters of credit outstanding). As of January 29, 2012, we had an aggregate of $1.203 billion of term loan borrowings under the amended facility outstanding (based on the applicable exchange rates on January 29, 2012). The amended facility provides for approximately $450 million of revolving credit (based on the applicable exchange rates on January 29, 2012), under which we had no revolving credit borrowings and $72.2 million of letters of credit outstanding as of January 29, 2012. The revolving credit facility was undrawn as of January 29, 2012. The terms of each of the term loan A and B facilities contain a mandatory repayment schedule on a quarterly basis. The outstanding borrowings under the amended facility are prepayable without penalty (other than customary breakage costs). The terms of the amended facility require us to repay certain amounts outstanding thereunder with (a) net cash proceeds of the incurrence of certain indebtedness, (b) net cash proceeds of certain asset sales or other dispositions (including as a result of casualty or condemnation) that exceed certain thresholds, to the extent such proceeds are not reinvested in the business in accordance with customary reinvestment provisions and (c) a percentage of excess cash flow, which percentage is based upon our leverage ratio during the relevant fiscal period. The United States dollar-denominated borrowings under the amended facility bear interest at a rate equal to an applicable margin plus, as determined at our option, either (a) a base rate determined as the highest of (i) the prime rate, (ii) the United States federal funds rate plus 1/2 of 1% and (iii) a one-month adjusted Eurocurrency rate plus 1% (provided that, in the case of the term loan B facility, in no event will the base rate be deemed to be less than 1.75%) or (b) an adjusted Eurocurrency rate, calculated in a manner set forth in the amended facility (provided that, in the case of the term loan B facility, in no event will the adjusted Eurocurrency rate be less than 0.75%). Canadian dollar-denominated borrowings under the amended facility bear interest at a rate equal to an applicable margin plus, as determined at our option, either (a) a Canadian prime rate determined by reference to the greater of (i) the average of the rates of interest per annum equal to the per annum rate of interest quoted, published and commonly known in Canada as the prime rate or which Royal Bank of Canada establishes at its main office in Toronto, Ontario as the reference rate of interest in order to determine interest rates for loans in Canadian dollars to its Canadian borrowers and (ii) the sum of (x) the average of the rates per annum for Canadian dollar bankers acceptances having a term of one month that appears on the Reuters Screen CDOR Page as of 10:00 a.m. (Toronto time) on the date of determination, as reported by the administrative agent (and if such screen is not available, any successor or similar service as may be selected by the administrative agent), and (y) 1%, or (b) an adjusted Eurocurrency rate, calculated in a manner set forth in the amended facility. 38 The borrowings under the amended facility in currencies other than United States dollars or Canadian dollars bear interest at a rate equal to an applicable margin plus an adjusted Eurocurrency rate, calculated in a manner set forth in the amended facility (provided that, in the case of the term loan B facility, in no event will the adjusted Eurocurrency rate be less than 0.75%). The current applicable margins will be (a) in the case of the United States dollar-denominated term loan A facility, 2.50% for adjusted Eurocurrency rate loans and 1.50% for base rate loans, as applicable, (b) in the case of the United States dollar-denominated term loan B facility, 2.75% for adjusted Eurocurrency rate loans and 1.75% for base rate loans, as applicable, (c) in the case of the Euro-denominated term loan A facility, 2.75%, (d) in the case of the Euro-denominated term loan B facility, 3.00% and (e) in the case of the revolving credit facilities, (x) for borrowings denominated in United States dollars, 2.50% for adjusted Eurocurrency rate loans and 1.50% for base rate loans, as applicable, (y) for borrowings denominated in Canadian dollars, 2.50% for adjusted Eurocurrency rate loans and 1.50% for Canadian prime rate loans, as applicable, and (z) for borrowings denominated in other currencies, 2.75%. After the date of delivery of the compliance certificate and financial statements with respect to our fiscal quarter ending January 29, 2012 and each subsequent quarter, the applicable margin for borrowings under the term loan A facilities and the revolving credit facilities will be adjusted based on our leverage ratio. On May 4, 2011, we entered into an interest rate swap agreement for a three-year term commencing on June 6, 2011. The agreement has been designed with the intended effect of converting an initial notional amount of $632.0 million of our variable rate debt obligation under our United States dollar-denominated senior secured term loan A facility to fixed rate debt. According to a pre-set schedule during the term of the swap agreement, the initial notional amount was reduced to $616.0 million as of January 29, 2012, and will continue to be reduced such that, based on our projections for future debt repayments, our outstanding debt under the facility is expected to always exceed the then-outstanding notional amount of the swap. Under the terms of the agreement for the then-outstanding notional amount, our exposure to fluctuations in the three-month London inter-bank borrowing rate ( LIBOR ) is eliminated, and we will pay a fixed rate of 1.197%, plus the current applicable margin. In addition, on May 4, 2011, we entered into an interest rate cap agreement for a 15-month term commencing on June 6, 2011. The agreement has been designed with the intended effect of capping the interest rate on an initial notional amount of 165.9 million of our variable rate debt obligation under our Euro-denominated senior secured term loan A and B facilities. According to a pre-set schedule during the term of the swap agreement, the initial notional amount was reduced to 98.9 million as of January 29, 2012, and will continue to be adjusted such that our outstanding debt under the facilities is expected to always exceed the notional amount of the cap agreement. Under the terms of this agreement, the three-month Euro inter-bank borrowing rate ( EURIBOR ) that we will pay is capped at a rate of 2%. Therefore, the maximum amount of interest that we will pay on the notional amount will be at the 2% capped rate, plus the current applicable margin. The amended facility contains covenants that restrict our ability to finance future operations or capital needs, to take advantage of other business opportunities that may be in our interest or to satisfy our obligations under our other outstanding debt. These covenants restrict our ability to, among other things: incur or guarantee additional debt or extend credit; make restricted payments, including paying dividends or making distributions on, or redeeming or repurchasing, our capital stock or certain debt; make acquisitions and investments; dispose of assets; engage in transactions with affiliates; enter into agreements restricting our subsidiaries ability to pay dividends; create liens on our assets or engage in sale/leaseback transactions; and effect a consolidation or merger, or sell, transfer, lease all or substantially all of our assets. The amended facility requires us to comply with certain financial covenants, including maximum leverage, minimum interest coverage and maximum capital expenditures. A breach of any of these operating or financial covenants would result in a default under the applicable facility. If an event of default occurs and is continuing, the lenders could elect to declare all amounts then outstanding, together with accrued interest, to be immediately due and payable which would result in acceleration of our other debt. If we were unable to repay any such borrowings when due, the lenders could proceed against their collateral, which also secures some of our other indebtedness. 39 We are also subject to similar covenants and restrictions in connection with our other long-term debt agreements. As of January 29, 2012, we were in compliance with all financial and non-financial covenants. As of January 29, 2012, our corporate credit was rated Ba2 by Moody with a positive outlook and our issuer credit was rated BB+ by Standard & Poor with a stable outlook. In assessing our credit strength, we believe that both Moody and Standard & Poor considered, among other things, our capital structure and financial policies as well as our consolidated balance sheet, our historical acquisition activity and other financial information, as well as industry and other qualitative factors. Contractual Obligations The following table summarizes, as of January 29, 2012, our contractual cash obligations by future period: Payments Due by Period Description Total Obligations 2012 2013-2014 2015-2016 Thereafter (in millions) Long-term debt (1) $ 1,903.3 $ 70.0 $ 281.2 $ 852.1 $ 700.0 Interest payments on long-term debt (2) 619.1 96.7 178.3 135.0 209.1 Short-term borrowings 13.0 13.0 Operating and capital leases (3) 1,720.7 297.3 470.5 362.4 590.4 Inventory purchase commitments (4) 757.5 757.5 Minimum contractual royalty payments (5) 48.1 22.0 18.1 6.0 2.0 Non-qualified supplemental defined benefit plans (6) 30.5 2.6 5.6 5.4 16.9 Sponsorship payments (7) 38.9 14.7 16.0 8.2 Payment to reacquire Tommy Hilfiger tailored apparel license (8) 24.9 24.9 Other contractual obligations (9) 24.7 10.4 14.3 Total contractual cash obligations $ 5,180.7 $ 1,309.1 $ 984.0 $ 1,369.1 $ 1,518.4 ______________________ (1) At January 29, 2012 we have outstanding $725.5 million of senior secured term loan A facility and $477.8 million of senior secured term loan B facility requiring mandatory payments between March 31, 2012 and May 6, 2016 (according to the mandatory repayment schedule), $600.0 million of 7 3/8% senior unsecured notes due May 15, 2020 and $100.0 million of 7 3/4% debentures due November 15, 2023. Interest on the senior secured term loans is payable quarterly and interest on the senior unsecured notes and debentures is payable semi-annually. (2) Interest payments on long-term debt are based on Euro to United States dollar exchange rates and interest rates as of January 29, 2012. The interest payments on long-term debt could fluctuate. We, however, have entered into interest rate swap and cap agreements to manage our exposure to interest rate changes. As of January 29, 2012 approximately 75% of our total debt was at a fixed rate or at a variable rate that was capped, with the remainder at variable rates that were uncapped. (3) Includes retail store, warehouse, showroom, office and equipment operating leases, as well as capital leases. Retail store operating leases generally provide for payment of direct operating costs in addition to rent. The obligation amounts listed include future minimum lease payments and exclude such direct operating costs. Please refer to Note 14, Leases, in the Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements included in Item 8 of this report for further information. (4) Represents contractual commitments for goods on order and not received or paid for as of January 29, 2012. Substantially all of these goods are expected to be received and the related payments are expected to be made within six months of our year end. This amount does not include foreign currency exchange forward contracts that we have entered into to manage our exposure to exchange rate changes with respect to certain of these purchases. Please refer to Note 8, Derivative Financial Instruments, in the Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements included in Item 8 of this report for further information. 40 (5) Our minimum contractual royalty payments arise under numerous license agreements we have with third parties, each of which has different royalty rates and terms. Agreements typically require us to make minimum payments to the licensors of the licensed trademarks based on expected or required minimum levels of sales of licensed products, as well as additional royalty payments when our sales exceed such minimum sales. Certain of our license agreements require that we pay a specified percentage of net sales to the licensor for advertising and promotion of the licensed products, with no minimum amount required to be paid. These amounts, as well as any advertising spending requirements, are excluded from the minimum contractual royalty payments shown in the table. There is no guarantee that we will exceed the minimum payments under any of these license agreements. However, given our projected sales levels for products covered under these agreements, we currently anticipate that future payments required under our license agreements on an aggregate basis will exceed the contractual minimums shown in the table. (6) We have an unfunded non-qualified supplemental defined benefit plan covering three current and 17 retired executives under which the participants will receive a predetermined amount during the 10 years following the attainment of age 65, provided that prior to the termination of employment with us, the participant has been in such plan for at least 10 years and has attained age 55. In addition, as a result of our acquisition of Tommy Hilfiger, we also have for certain members of Tommy Hilfiger domestic senior management a supplemental executive retirement plan, which is a non-qualified unfunded supplemental defined benefit pension plan. Such plan is frozen and, as a result, participants do not accrue additional benefits. (7) Represents payment obligations for sponsorships. We have agreements for our IZOD brand as the title sponsor of the IZOD IndyCar Series and the official apparel sponsor of the IndyCar and the Indianapolis Motor Speedway. We also have agreements relating to our Van Heusen brand sponsorship of the National Football League and the Pro Football Hall of Fame, our sponsorships of the 2014 Super Bowl Host Committee and of certain professional sports teams and athletes and other similar sponsorships. (8) We entered into agreements during 2011 to reacquire from a licensee, prior to the expiration of the license, the rights to distribute Tommy Hilfiger brand tailored apparel in Europe and acquire an outlet store from the licensee. The transfer of the rights and store ownership will be effective December 31, 2012. Under these agreements, we made a payment of $9.6 million (based on the applicable exchange rate in effect on the payment date) to the licensee during the fourth quarter of 2011 and are required to make an additional payment to the licensee during 2012 (based on the applicable exchange rate in effect on the payment date). (9) Represents amounts payable in connection with Tommy Hilfiger acquisition of a licensee business in Japan prior to our acquisition of Tommy Hilfiger, which obligations we assumed as of the effective date of our acquisition of Tommy Hilfiger. Not included in the above table are contingent purchase price payments we are obligated to pay Mr. Calvin Klein based on 1.15% of total worldwide net sales, as defined in the agreement governing the Calvin Klein acquisition, of products bearing any of the Calvin Klein brands and are required to be made with respect to sales made through February 12, 2018. A significant portion of the sales on which the payments to Mr. Klein are made are wholesale sales by us and our licensees and other partners to retailers. Such contingent purchase price payments totaled $50.7 million in 2011. Not included in the above table are contingent purchase price payments we are obligated to pay GVM based on a percentage of annual sales over a certain threshold of Tommy Hilfiger products in India for a period of five years (or, under certain circumstances, a period of six years) following the acquisition date of September 7, 2011. Such payments are subject to a $25.0 million aggregate maximum and are due within 60 days following each one year period commencing on July 1, 2011. Not included in the above table are contributions to our defined benefit qualified pension plans, or payments to employees and retirees in connection with our supplemental pension and postretirement health plans. Contractual cash obligations for these plans cannot be determined due to the number of assumptions required to estimate our future benefit obligations, including return on assets, discount rate and future compensation increases. The liabilities associated with these plans are presented in Note 10, Retirement and Benefit Plans, in the Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements included in Item 8 of this report. Not included in the above table are $173.1 million of net potential cash obligations associated with unrecognized tax benefits due to the uncertainty regarding the future cash outflows associated with such obligations. Please refer to Note 7, Income Taxes, in the Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements included in Item 8 of this report for further information related to unrecognized tax benefits. 41 Not included in the above table are $11.7 million of asset retirement obligations related to leased office and retail store locations due to the uncertainty of timing of future cash outflows associated with such obligations. Please refer to Note 20, Other Comments, in the Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements included in Item 8 of this report for further information related to asset retirement obligations. Off-Balance Sheet Arrangements We do not have any off-balance sheet arrangements that have a material current effect, or that are reasonably likely to have a material future effect, on our financial position, changes in financial position, revenue, expenses, results of operations, liquidity, capital expenditures or capital resources. MARKET RISK INTEREST AND EXCHANGE RATE SENSITIVITY Financial instruments held by us as of January 29, 2012 include cash equivalents, short and long-term debt, foreign currency forward exchange contracts and interest rate swap and cap agreements. Note 9, Fair Value Measurements, in the Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements included in Item 8 of this report outlines the fair value of our financial instruments as of January 29, 2012. Cash and cash equivalents held by us are affected by short-term interest rates. Therefore, a change in short-term interest rates would have an impact on our interest income. Due to the currently low rates of return we are receiving on our cash equivalents, the impact of a further decrease in short-term interest rates would not have a material impact on our interest income, while an increase in short-term interest rates could have a more material impact. Based upon our balance of cash and cash equivalents at January 29, 2012, the effect of a 10 basis point increase in short-term interest rates on our interest income would be approximately $0.2 million annually. Due to the fact that certain of our debt is denominated in foreign currency, our interest expense is, and in the future will continue to be, impacted by fluctuations in exchange rates. Borrowings under our amended credit facility bear interest at a rate equal to an applicable margin plus a variable rate, each of which is determined based on the jurisdiction of such borrowings. As such, our amended facility also exposes us to market risk for changes in interest rates. During the second quarter of 2011, however, we entered into interest rate swap and cap agreements for the intended purpose of reducing our exposure to interest rate volatility. Please refer to Note 6, Debt, in the Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements included in Item 8 of this report for a further discussion. As of January 29, 2012, after taking into account the interest rate swap and cap agreements, approximately 75% of our total debt was at a fixed rate or at a variable rate that was capped, with the remainder at variable rates that were uncapped. Based upon our debt position and the Euro to United States dollar exchange rate at January 29, 2012, and the effect of the swap and cap agreements, the effect of a 10 basis point increase in interest rates on our interest expense would be approximately $0.2 million annually and the effect of a 5% increase in the Euro to United States dollar exchange rate on our interest expense related to our Euro-denominated debt would be $0.4 million annually. Our Tommy Hilfiger business has a substantial international component, which exposes us to significant foreign exchange risk. Accordingly, the impact of a strengthening United States dollar, particularly against the Euro, the Japanese Yen and the Canadian dollar, among other currencies, will have a negative impact on our results of operations. Our Tommy Hilfiger business purchases the majority of the products that it sells in United States dollars, which exposes the international Tommy Hilfiger business to foreign exchange risk as the United States dollar fluctuates. As such, we currently use and plan to continue to use foreign currency forward exchange contracts or other derivative instruments to mitigate the cash flow or market value risks associated with United States dollar-denominated purchases by the Tommy Hilfiger business. We are also exposed to market risk for changes in exchange rates for the United States dollar in connection with our licensing businesses, particularly our Calvin Klein business. Most of our license agreements require the licensee to report sales to us in the licensee local currency but to pay us in United States dollars based on the exchange rate as of the last day of the contractual selling period. Thus, while we are not exposed to exchange rate gains and losses between the end of the selling period and the date we collect payment, we are exposed to exchange rate changes during and up to the last day of the selling period. In addition, certain of our other foreign license agreements expose us to exchange rate changes up to the date we collect payment or convert local currency payments into United States dollars. As a result, during times of a strengthening United States dollar, our foreign royalty revenue will be adversely impacted, and during times of a weakening United States dollar, our foreign royalty revenue will be favorably impacted. 42 SEASONALITY Our business generally follows a seasonal pattern. Our wholesale businesses tend to generate higher levels of sales in the first and third quarters, while our retail businesses tend to generate higher levels of sales in the fourth quarter. Royalty, advertising and other revenue tends to be earned somewhat evenly throughout the year, although the third quarter has the highest level of royalty revenue due to higher sales by licensees in advance of the holiday selling season. RECENT ACCOUNTING PRONOUNCEMENTS The Financial Accounting Standards Board ( FASB ) issued in May 2011 guidance to clarify and revise the requirements for measuring fair value and for disclosing information about fair value measurements. We will adopt this guidance prospectively beginning in 2012. We do not expect the adoption to have a material impact on our consolidated results of operations or financial position. The FASB issued in June 2011 guidance that revises the manner in which entities present comprehensive income in their financial statements. The guidance requires that net income and other comprehensive income be reported either in a single, continuous statement of comprehensive income or in two separate, but consecutive, statements. Presentation of components of comprehensive income in the Consolidated Statements of Changes in Stockholders Equity will no longer be allowed. Adjustments for items that are reclassified from other comprehensive income to net income must be presented on the face of the financial statements where the components of net income and other comprehensive income are presented. We will apply this guidance retrospectively, as required, beginning with the first quarter of 2012. The adoption will not have any impact on our consolidated results of operations or financial position. The FASB issued in September 2011 guidance that is intended to reduce the cost and complexity of the goodwill impairment test by providing an entity with the option to first assess qualitatively whether it is necessary to perform the two-step impairment test that is currently in place. An entity would not be required to quantitatively calculate the fair value of a reporting unit unless the entity determines that it is more likely than not that its fair value is less than its carrying amount. The guidance is effective for fiscal years beginning after December 15, 2011, with earlier application permitted. We will adopt this guidance in 2012 and do not expect the adoption to have a material impact on our consolidated results of operations or financial position. CRITICAL ACCOUNTING POLICIES AND ESTIMATES Our consolidated financial statements are based on the selection and application of significant accounting policies, which require management to make significant estimates and assumptions. Our significant accounting policies are outlined in Note 1, Summary of Significant Accounting Policies, in the Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements included in Item 8 of this report. We believe that the following are the more critical judgmental areas in the application of our accounting policies that currently affect our financial position and results of operations: Sales allowances and returns We have arrangements with many of our department and specialty store customers to support their sales of our products. We establish accruals which, based on a review of the individual customer arrangements and the expected performance of our products in their stores, we believe will be required to satisfy our sales allowance obligations. We also establish accruals, which are based on historical data and authorized amounts, that we believe are necessary to provide for inventory returns. It is possible that the accrual estimates could vary from actual results, which would require adjustment to the allowance and returns accruals. Inventories Inventories related to our wholesale operations and international retail operations, comprised principally of finished goods, are stated at the lower of cost or market. Inventories related to our North American retail operations, comprised entirely of finished goods, are stated at the lower of cost or market. We review current business trends, inventory agings and discontinued merchandise categories to determine adjustments which are estimated to be necessary to liquidate existing clearance inventories and reduce inventories to the lower of cost or market. We believe that all inventory writedowns required at January 29, 2012 have been recorded. If market conditions were to change, it is possible that the required level of inventory reserves would need to be adjusted. Asset impairments During 2011, 2010 and 2009, we determined that the long-lived assets in certain of our outlet retail stores and other locations were not recoverable, which resulted in us recording impairment charges. In order to calculate the impairment charges, we estimated the undiscounted future cash flows and the related fair value of each asset. The undiscounted future cash flows for each asset were estimated using current sales trends and other factors. If different 43 assumptions had been used for future sales trends, the recorded impairment charges could have been significantly higher or lower. Note 9, Fair Value Measurements, in the Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements included in Item 8 of this report includes a further discussion of the circumstances surrounding the impairments and the assumptions related to the impairment charges. Allowance for doubtful accounts Accounts receivable, as presented on our Consolidated Balance Sheets, is net of an allowance for doubtful accounts. An allowance for doubtful accounts is determined through an analysis of the aging of accounts receivable and assessments of collectibility based on historic trends, the financial position of our customers and an evaluation of economic conditions. Because we cannot predict future changes in economic conditions and in the financial stability of our customers, actual future losses from uncollectible accounts may differ from our estimates and could impact our allowance for doubtful accounts. Income taxes Deferred income tax balances reflect the effects of temporary differences between the carrying amounts of assets and liabilities and their tax bases and are stated at enacted tax rates expected to be in effect when taxes are actually paid or recovered. FASB guidance on accounting for income taxes requires that deferred tax assets be evaluated for future realization and reduced by a valuation allowance to the extent we believe a portion will not be realized. We consider many factors when assessing the likelihood of future realization of our deferred tax assets, including our recent earnings experience and expectations of future taxable income by taxing jurisdiction, the carryforward periods available to us for tax reporting purposes and other relevant factors. The actual realization of deferred tax assets may differ significantly from the amounts we have recorded. During the ordinary course of business, there are many transactions and calculations for which the ultimate tax determination is uncertain. Accounting for income taxes requires a two-step approach to recognizing and measuring uncertain tax positions. The first step is to evaluate the tax position for recognition by determining if available evidence indicates it is more likely than not that the tax position will be fully sustained upon review by taxing authorities, including resolution of related appeals or litigation processes, if any. The second step is to measure the tax benefit as the largest amount that is greater than 50 percent likely of being realized upon ultimate settlement. For tax positions that are 50 percent or less likely of being sustained upon audit, we do not recognize any portion of that benefit in the financial statements. We consider many factors when evaluating and estimating our tax positions and tax benefits, which may require periodic adjustments and which may not accurately anticipate actual outcomes. Our actual results could differ materially from our current estimates. Goodwill and other intangible assets Goodwill and other indefinite-lived intangible assets are tested for impairment annually, at the beginning of the third quarter of each fiscal year, and between annual tests if an event occurs or circumstances change that would indicate the carrying amount may be impaired. Impairment testing for goodwill is done at a reporting unit level. A reporting unit is defined as an operating segment or one level below an operating segment, called a component. However, two or more components of an operating segment will be aggregated and deemed a single reporting unit if the components have similar operating characteristics. We calculate the fair value of goodwill and intangible assets, as necessary, using a discounted cash flow method. The discounted cash flow method is based on the present value of projected cash flows. Assumptions used in these cash flow projections are generally consistent with our internal forecasts. The estimated cash flows are discounted using a rate that represents the weighted average cost of capital. The weighted average cost of capital is based on a number of variables, including the equity-risk premium and risk-free interest rate. The fair value of all reporting units is reconciled to our market capitalization using an estimated control premium. Management believes the assumptions used for the impairment tests are consistent with those that would be utilized by a market participant performing similar valuations for our reporting units. The projected cash flows and weighted average cost of capital may be impacted by adverse changes in market and economic conditions and are subject to change based on the facts and circumstances that exist at the time of the valuation. No impairment of goodwill or other intangible assets resulted from our impairment tests in 2011. If different assumptions for future discounted cash flows and allocation of net assets to our reporting units had been applied, significantly different results of our goodwill impairment tests could have resulted. Based upon the results of our annual goodwill impairment testing during 2011 and our future cash flow projections, we currently do not believe that any of our reporting units are at significant risk for a future material goodwill impairment. Pension benefits Included in the calculations of expense and liabilities for our pension plans are various assumptions, including return on assets, discount rate and future compensation increases. Note 10, Retirement and Benefit Plans, in the Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements included in Item 8 of this report sets forth the significant rate assumptions used in performing certain calculations related to our pension plans. Actual results could differ from these assumptions, which would require adjustments to our balance sheet and could result in volatility in our future pension expense. 44 Stock-based compensation Accounting for stock-based compensation requires measurement of compensation cost for all stock-based awards at fair value on the date of grant and recognition of compensation over the service period for awards expected to vest. We use the Black-Scholes-Merton option pricing model to determine the fair value of our stock options. This model uses assumptions that include the risk free interest rate, expected volatility, expected dividend yield and expected life of the options. The fair value of restricted stock units and restricted stock are determined based on the quoted price of our common stock on the date of grant. The fair value of contingently issuable performance shares is based on the quoted price of our common stock on the date of grant, reduced for the present value of any dividends expected to be paid on our common stock during the performance cycle, as the contingently issuable performance shares do not accrue dividends prior to being earned. We record expense for contingently issuable performance shares based on our current expectations of the probable number of shares that will ultimately be issued. The value of our stock-based awards is recognized as expense over the service period, net of estimated forfeitures. The estimation of stock awards that will ultimately vest requires judgment, and to the extent actual results or updated estimates differ from our current estimates, such amounts will be recorded as a cumulative adjustment in the period estimates are revised. We consider many factors when estimating expected forfeitures, including types of awards, employee class and historical experience. Actual results and future estimates may differ substantially from our current estimates.
