OVERVIEW We are a specialty retailer of automotive aftermarket parts, tools, supplies, equipment and accessories in the United States. We are one of the largest U.S. automotive aftermarket specialty retailers, selling our products to both do-it-yourself ("DIY") customers and professional service providers our "dual market strategy." Our stores carry an extensive product line consisting of new and remanufactured automotive hard parts, maintenance items, accessories, a complete line of auto body paint and related materials, automotive tools and professional service provider service equipment. Our extensive product line includes an assortment of products that are differentiated by quality and price for most of the product lines we offer. For many of our product offerings, this quality differentiation reflects "good," "better," and "best" alternatives. Our sales and total gross margin dollars are highest for the "best" quality category of products. Consumers' willingness to select products at a higher point on the value spectrum is a driver of sales and profitability in our industry. Our stores also offer enhanced services and programs to our customers, including used oil, oil filter and battery recycling; battery, wiper and bulb replacement; battery diagnostic testing; electrical and module testing; check engine light code extraction; loaner tool program; drum and rotor resurfacing; custom hydraulic hoses; professional paint shop mixing and related materials; and machine shops. As of December 31, 2014 , we operated 4,366 stores in 43 states. Operating within the retail industry, we are influenced by a number of general macroeconomic factors including, but not limited to, fuel costs, unemployment rates, consumer preferences and spending habits, and competition. During challenging macroeconomic conditions, we believe that the average consumer's tendency has been to "trade down" to lower quality products. We have ongoing initiatives aimed at tailoring our product offering to adjust to customers' changing preferences; however, we also continue to have initiatives focused on marketing and training to educate customers on the advantages of "purchasing up" on the value spectrum. 23 We believe the key drivers of current and future demand of the products sold within the automotive aftermarket include the number of U.S. miles driven, number of U.S. registered vehicles, new light vehicle registrations, average vehicle age and unemployment. Number of Miles Driven - The number of total miles driven in the U.S. influences the demand for repair and maintenance products sold within the automotive aftermarket. According to the Department of Transportation, prior to 2007, the annual number of total miles driven in the U.S. had steadily increased; however, between 2008 and 2013, as the U.S. experienced difficult macroeconomic conditions and historically high levels of unemployment, the number of total miles driven in the U.S. remained relatively flat. As the U.S. economy began to recover in 2014, miles driven also improved and through November of 2014, year-to-date total miles driven in the U.S. increased 1.4%. We believe that as the U.S. economy continues to recover and the level of unemployment continues to decline, total miles driven in the U.S. will continue to increase and return to the historical trend of long-term annual growth. In addition, vehicles in the U.S. continue to be driven approximately three trillion miles per year, resulting in ongoing wear and tear and continued demand for the repair and maintenance products sold within the automotive aftermarket. Number of U.S. Registered Vehicles, New Light Vehicle Registrations and Average Vehicle Age - The total number of vehicles on the road and the average age of the vehicle population heavily influence the demand for products sold within the automotive aftermarket industry. As reported by The Auto Care Association, the total number of registered vehicles increased 6% from 2003 to 2013, bringing the number of light vehicles on the road to 249 million by the end of 2013. As of December 31, 2014, the seasonally adjusted annual rate of light vehicle sales in the U.S. was approximately 17 million , contributing to the continued growth in the total number of registered vehicles on the road. During the past decade, vehicle scrappage rates have remained relatively stable, ranging from just 5.2% to 5.7% annually. The stable scrappage rates over the past decade have contributed to an increase in the average age of the U.S. vehicle population over that period, growing 16% , from 9.7 years in 2003 to 11.3 years in 2013. We believe this increase in average age can be attributed to better engineered and manufactured vehicles, which can be reliably driven at higher mileages due to better quality power trains and interiors and exteriors, and the consumer's willingness to invest in maintaining these higher-mileage, better built vehicles. As the average age of the vehicle on the road increases, a larger percentage of miles are being driven by vehicles which are outside of a manufacturer warranty. These out-of-warranty, older vehicles generate strong demand for automotive aftermarket products as they go through more routine maintenance cycles, have more frequent mechanical failures and generally require more maintenance than newer vehicles. We believe consumers will continue to invest in these reliable, higher-quality, higher-mileage vehicles and these investments, along with an increasing total light vehicle fleet, will support continued demand for automotive aftermarket products. Unemployment - Unemployment, underemployment, the threat of future joblessness and the uncertainty surrounding the overall economic health of the U.S. have a negative impact on consumer confidence and the level of consumer discretionary spending. Long-term trends of high unemployment could impede the growth of annual miles driven, as well as decrease consumer discretionary spending, both of which negatively impact demand for products sold in the automotive aftermarket industry. However, as of December 31, 2014 , the U.S. unemployment rate decreased to 5.6% , its lowest rate in over six years. We believe that as the economy continues to recover, total employment should increase and we would expect to see a corresponding increase in commuter traffic as unemployed individuals return to work. Aided by the anticipated increase in commuter miles, we believe overall annual U.S. miles driven should return to a period of annual growth, resulting in continued demand for automotive aftermarket products. We remain confident in our ability to gain market share in our existing markets and grow our business in new markets by focusing on our dual market strategy and the core O'Reilly values of hard work and excellent customer service. KEY EVENTS AND RECENT DEVELOPMENTS Several key events have had or may have a significant impact on our operations and are identified below: On January 26, 2015, Standard and Poor's Ratings Services raised all of its ratings on the Company, which moved the Company's unsecured revolving credit facility applicable rate to the tier one pricing level, thus reducing the facility fee and interest rate margins on borrowings of Eurodollar Rate loans. Under the Company's share repurchase program, as approved by the Board of Directors in January of 2011, the Company may, from time to time, repurchase shares of its common stock, solely through open market purchases effected through a broker dealer at prevailing market prices, based on a variety of factors such as price, corporate trading policy requirements and overall market conditions. The Company and its Board of Directors may increase or otherwise modify, renew, suspend or terminate the share repurchase program at any time, without prior notice. As announced on February 5, 2014, August 13, 2014, and February 4, 2015, our Board of Directors each time approved a resolution to increase the authorization amount under our share repurchase program by an additional $500 million , resulting in a cumulative authorization amount of $5.0 billion . Each additional $500 million authorization is each effective for a three -year period beginning on their respective announcement date. The authorizations under the share repurchase program that currently have capacity are scheduled to expire on August 13, 2017, and February 4, 24 2018. As of February 27, 2015, the Company had repurchased approximately 46.5 million shares of its common stock at an aggregate cost of $4.2 billion under this program. RESULTS OF OPERATIONS The following table includes income statement data as a percentage of sales for the years ended December 31, 2014 , 2013 and 2012 : For the Year Ended December 31, 2014 2013 2012 Sales 100.0 % 100.0 % 100.0 % Cost of goods sold, including warehouse and distribution expenses 48.6 49.3 49.9 Gross profit 51.4 50.7 50.1 Selling, general and administrative expenses 33.8 34.1 34.3 Operating income 17.6 16.6 15.8 Interest expense (0.7 ) (0.7 ) (0.7 ) Interest income 0.1 Income before income taxes 16.9 15.9 15.2 Provision for income taxes 6.1 5.8 5.7 Net income 10.8 % 10.1 % 9.5 % 2014 Compared to 2013 Sales: Sales for the year ended December 31, 2014 , increased $567 million to $7.22 billion from $6.65 billion for the same period one year ago, representing an increase of 9% . Comparable store sales for stores open at least one year increased 6.0% and 4.3% for the years ended December 31, 2014 and 2013 , respectively. Comparable store sales are calculated based on the change in sales of stores open at least one year and exclude sales of specialty machinery, sales to independent parts stores and sales to Team Members. The following table presents the components of the increase in sales for the year ended December 31, 2014 (in millions): Increase in Sales for the Year Ended December 31, 2014, Compared to the Same Period in 2013 Store sales: Comparable store sales $ 389 Non-comparable store sales: Sales for stores opened throughout 2013, excluding stores open at least one year that are included in comparable store sales 90 Sales in 2013 for stores that have closed (4 ) Sales for stores opened throughout 2014 85 Non-store sales: Includes sales of machinery and sales to independent parts stores and Team Members 7 Total increase in sales $ 567 We believe the increased sales achieved by our stores are the result of store growth and the high levels of customer service provided by our well-trained and technically proficient Team Members, superior inventory availability, including same day and over-night access to inventory in our regional distribution centers, enhanced services and programs offered in our stores, a broader selection of product offerings in most stores with a dynamic catalog system to identify and source parts, a targeted promotional and advertising effort through a variety of media and localized promotional events, continued improvement in the merchandising and store layouts of our stores, compensation programs for all store Team Members that provide incentives for performance and our continued focus on serving both DIY and professional service provider customers. Our comparable store sales increase for the year ended December 31, 2014 , was driven by increases in average ticket values and customer transaction counts for both DIY and professional service provider customers. The improvements in average ticket values were the result 25 of the continued growth of the more costly, hard part categories as a percentage of our total sales. The overall growth in our hard part categories continues to be driven by our faster growing professional service provider sales, which are primarily comprised of hard part categories and by the increasing complexity and cost of replacement parts necessary to maintain the current population of better engineered and more technically advanced vehicles. These vehicles require less frequent repairs and the component parts are more durable and last for longer periods of time; however, when repairs are required, the cost of the replacement parts is, on average, greater. While the less frequent repairs required by these better engineered and manufactured vehicles does create pressure on transaction counts, both DIY and professional service provider customer transaction counts were positive for the year ended December 31, 2014. The increases in professional service provider customer transaction counts were primarily driven by our acquired markets and the continued growth of less mature stores. The increases in DIY transaction counts were driven by our ongoing focus on staffing our stores with knowledgeable parts professionals to assist our DIY customers during high DIY traffic periods, including nights and weekends. We opened 200 net, new stores during the year ended December 31, 2014 , compared to 190 net, new stores for the year ended December 31, 2013 . At December 31, 2014 , we operated 4,366 stores in 43 states compared to 4,166 stores in 42 states at December 31, 2013 . We anticipate total new store growth to increase to 205 net, new store openings in 2015 . Gross profit: Gross profit for the year ended December 31, 2014 , increased to $3.71 billion (or 51.4% of sales) from $3.37 billion (or 50.7% of sales) for the same period one year ago, representing an increase of 10% . The increase in gross profit dollars was primarily a result of the increase in comparable store sales at existing stores and sales from new stores. The increase in gross profit as a percentage of sales for the year ended December 31, 2014, was primarily due to product acquisition cost improvements, partially offset by the non-cash last-in, first-out ("LIFO") negative impact resulting from continued product acquisition cost reductions. Acquisition cost improvements are the result of our ongoing negotiations with our vendors to improve our inventory purchase costs. During the third quarter of 2013, we fully depleted our LIFO reserve due to acquisition cost improvements we realized over time. Our policy is to not write up inventory in excess of replacement cost and, accordingly, we are effectively valuing our inventory at replacement cost. During the year ended December 31, 2014, our LIFO cost was written down by approximately $41 million to reflect replacement cost. Selling, general and administrative expenses: Selling, general and administrative expenses ("SG&A") for the year ended December 31, 2014 , increased to $2.44 billion (or 33.8% of sales) from $2.27 billion (or 34.1% of sales) for the same period one year ago, representing an increase of 8% . The increase in total SG&A dollars was primarily the result of additional Team Members, facilities and vehicles to support our increased store count. The decrease in SG&A as a percentage of sales was primarily the result of increased leverage of store occupancy costs on strong comparable store sales results. Operating income: As a result of the impacts discussed above, operating income for the year ended December 31, 2014 , increased to $1.27 billion (or 17.6% of sales) from $1.10 billion (or 16.6% of sales) for the same period one year ago, representing an increase of 15% . Other income and expense: Total other expense for the year ended December 31, 2014 , increased to $48 million (or 0.7% of sales), from $45 million (or 0.7% of sales) for the same period one year ago, representing an increase of 8% . The increase in total other expense for the year ended December 31, 2014 , was primarily the result of increased interest expense on higher average outstanding borrowings. Income taxes: Our provision for income taxes for the year ended December 31, 2014 , increased to $444 million ( 36.3% effective tax rate) from $389 million ( 36.7% effective tax rate) for the same period one year ago, representing an increase of 14% . The increase in our provision for income taxes was the result of higher taxable income in the current year, driven by our strong operating results. The decrease in our effective tax rate was primarily due to increased benefits from employment tax credits in the current year. Net income: As a result of the impacts discussed above, net income for the year ended December 31, 2014 , increased to $778 million (or 10.8% of sales), from $670 million (or 10.1% of sales) for the same period one year ago, representing an increase of 16% . Earnings per share: Our diluted earnings per common share for the year ended December 31, 2014 , increased 22% to $7.34 on 106 million shares from $6.03 on 111 million shares for the same period one year ago. 26 2013 Compared to 2012 Sales: Sales for the year ended December 31, 2013, increased $467 million to $6.65 billion from $6.18 billion for the same period one year prior, representing an increase of 8%. Comparable store sales for stores open at least one year increased 4.3% and 3.8% for the years ended December 31, 2013 and 2012, respectively. Comparable store sales are calculated based on the change in sales of stores open at least one year and exclude sales of specialty machinery, sales to independent parts stores, sales to Team Members and sales from the VIP Parts, Tires & Service ("VIP") stores acquired on December 31, 2012, due to the significant change in the business model and lack of historical data. The following table presents the components of the increase in sales for the year ended December 31, 2013 (in millions): Increase in Sales for the Year Ended December 31, 2013, Compared to the Same Period in 2012 Store sales: Comparable store sales $ 259 Non-comparable store sales: Sales for stores opened throughout 2012, excluding stores open at least one year that are included in comparable store sales 74 Sales in 2012 for stores that have closed (3 ) Sales for stores opened throughout 2013 and acquired VIP stores 134 Non-store sales: Includes sales of machinery and sales to independent parts stores and Team Members 3 Total increase in sales $ 467 We believe the increased sales achieved by our stores were the result of store growth and the high levels of customer service provided by our well-trained and technically proficient Team Members, superior inventory availability, including same day and over-night access to inventory in our distribution centers, enhanced services and programs offered in our stores, a broader selection of product offerings in most stores with a dynamic catalog system to identify and source parts, a targeted promotional and advertising effort through a variety of media and localized promotional events, continued improvement in the merchandising and store layouts of our stores, compensation programs for all store Team Members that provided incentives for performance and our continued focus on serving both DIY and professional service provider customers. Our comparable store sales increase for the year ended December 31, 2013, was driven by an increase in average ticket values for both DIY and professional service provider business, and an increase in customer transaction counts for professional service provider business, slightly offset by a small decrease in customer transaction counts for DIY business. The improvements in average ticket values were the result of the continued growth of the more costly hard part categories as a percentage of our total sales. The overall growth in the hard part categories continues to be driven by the increasing cost of replacement parts necessary to maintain the current population of better engineered and more technically advanced vehicles. These vehicles require less frequent repairs and the component parts are more durable and last for longer periods of time; however, when repairs are required, the cost of the replacement parts is, on average, greater. Both DIY and professional service provider customer transaction counts are negatively impacted by these less frequent repairs. The increases in our professional service provider customer transaction counts were driven by the chain wide growth of our professional business, while macroeconomic pressures on disposable income continue to negatively impact DIY customer transaction counts. We opened 190 net, new stores during the year ended December 31, 2013, compared to 180 net, new stores and 56 acquired stores for the year ended December 31, 2012. At December 31, 2013, we operated 4,166 stores in 42 states compared to 3,976 stores in 42 states at December 31, 2012. Gross profit: Gross profit for the year ended December 31, 2013, increased to $3.37 billion (or 50.7% of sales) from $3.10 billion (or 50.1% of sales) for the same period one year prior, representing an increase of 9%. The increase in gross profit dollars was primarily a result of the increase in comparable store sales at existing stores and sales from new stores. The increase in gross profit as a percentage of sales was primarily due to acquisition cost improvements, improved inventory shrinkage and distribution system efficiencies, partially offset by a smaller amount of capitalized distribution costs for the year ended December 31, 2013, the non-cash negative impact to gross margin resulting from the depletion of LIFO reserve and the impact of increased professional service provider sales as a percentage of our total sales mix. Acquisition cost improvements were the result of our ongoing negotiations with our suppliers to improve our inventory purchase costs. The improved inventory shrinkage was driven by our continued focus on inventory control and accountability through 27 our distribution and store networks. Distribution system efficiencies were the result of continued leverage on our increased sales volumes and more tenured and experienced DC Team Members in our maturing DCs. The decrease in capitalized distribution costs for the year ended December 31, 2013, was the result of the larger than typical benefit from capitalized distribution costs in 2012 associated with our initiative to increase our store-level inventories. The costs to move this additional inventory into the stores in 2012 were more efficient than routine restocking activity; as a result, we realized a larger than normal benefit from capitalized distribution costs. The complete depletion of our LIFO reserve during the year resulted from the acquisition cost improvements we realized over time. Our policy is to not write up inventory in excess of replacement cost and, accordingly, we began effectively valuing our inventory at replacement cost in 2013. During 2013, our LIFO cost was written down by approximately $21.6 million to reflect replacement cost in 2013. Professional service provider sales grew at a faster rate than DIY sales and professional service provider sales typically carry a lower gross profit as a percentage of sales than DIY sales, as volume discounts are granted on wholesale transactions to professional service provider customers; therefore, outsized growth in professional service provider sales, as compared to DIY, creates pressure on our gross profit as a percentage of sales. Selling, general and administrative expenses: Selling, general and administrative expenses ("SG&A") for the year ended December 31, 2013, increased to $2.27 billion (or 34.1% of sales) from $2.12 billion (or 34.3% of sales) for the same period one year prior, representing an increase of 7%. The increase in total SG&A dollars was primarily the result of additional Team Members, facilities and vehicles to support our increased store count. The decrease in SG&A as a percentage of sales was primarily the result of improved leverage of store payroll and occupancy costs on strong comparable store sales results. Operating income: As a result of the impacts discussed above, operating income for the year ended December 31, 2013, increased to $1.10 billion (or 16.6% of sales) from $977 million (or 15.8% of sales) for the same period one year prior, representing an increase of 13%. Other income and expense: Total other expense for the year ended December 31, 2013, increased to $45 million (or 0.7% of sales), from $36 million (or 0.6% of sales) for the same period one year prior, representing an increase of 24%. The increase in total other expense for the year ended December 31, 2013, was primarily due to increased interest expense on higher average outstanding borrowings. Income taxes: Our provision for income taxes for the year ended December 31, 2013, increased to $389 million (36.7% effective tax rate) from $356 million (37.8% effective tax rate) for the same period one year prior, representing an increase of 9%. The increase in our provision for income taxes was due to the increase in our taxable income. The decrease in our effective tax rate was primarily due to the benefits of employment tax credits realized in 2013, adjustments to tax reserves related to the favorable resolution of certain income tax audits during 2013 and unfavorable adjustments relating to certain income tax audits in 2012. Net income: As a result of the impacts discussed above, net income for the year ended December 31, 2013, increased to $670 million (or 10.1% of sales), from $586 million (or 9.5% of sales) for the same period one year prior, representing an increase of 14%. Earnings per share: Our diluted earnings per common share for the year ended December 31, 2013, increased 27% to $6.03 on 111 million shares from $4.75 on 123 million shares for the same period one year prior. LIQUIDITY AND CAPITAL RESOURCES Our long-term business strategy requires capital to open new stores, fund strategic acquisitions, expand distribution infrastructure, operate and maintain existing stores and may include the opportunistic repurchase of shares of our common stock through our Board-approved share repurchase program. The primary sources of our liquidity are funds generated from operations and borrowed under our unsecured revolving credit facility. Decreased demand for our products or changes in customer buying patterns could negatively impact our ability to generate funds from operations. Additionally, decreased demand or changes in buying patterns could impact our ability to meet the debt covenants of our credit agreement and, therefore, negatively impact the funds available under our unsecured revolving credit facility. We believe that cash expected to be provided by operating activities and availability under our unsecured revolving credit facility will be sufficient to fund both our short-term and long-term capital and liquidity needs for the foreseeable future. However, there can be no assurance that we will continue to generate cash flows at or above recent levels. 28 Liquidity and related ratios: The following table highlights our liquidity and related ratios as of December 31, 2014 and 2013 (dollars in millions): December 31, Percentage Change Liquidity and Related Ratios 2014 2013 Current assets $ 3,067 $ 2,835 8.2 % Current liabilities 2,831 2,423 16.8 % Working capital (1) 236 412 (42.7 )% Total debt 1,397 1,396 0.1 % Total equity $ 2,018 $ 1,966 2.6 % Debt to equity (2) 0.69:1 0.71:1 (2.8 )% (1) Working capital is calculated as current assets less current liabilities. (2) Debt to equity is calculated as total debt divided by total equity. Current assets increased 8% and current liabilities increased 17% from 2013 to 2014 . The increase in current assets was primarily due to the increase in inventory, resulting from the opening of 200 net, new stores. The increase in current liabilities was primarily due to the increase in accounts payable, resulting from inventory growth related to new store openings supported in part by our suppliers and additional supplier participation in our enhanced supplier financing program during the year, which allowed us to obtain more favorable payment terms. Our accounts payable to inventory ratio was 94.6% as of December 31, 2014 , as compared to 86.6% in the prior year. The following table identifies cash provided by/(used in) our operating, investing and financing activities for the years ended December 31, 2014 , 2013 and 2012 (in thousands): For the Year Ended December 31, Liquidity 2014 2013 2012 Total cash provided by/(used in): Operating activities $ 1,190,430 $ 908,026 $ 1,251,555 Investing activities (423,402 ) (388,754 ) (317,407 ) Financing activities (747,786 ) (536,082 ) (1,047,572 ) Increase (decrease) in cash and cash equivalents $ 19,242 $ (16,810 ) $ (113,424 ) Capital expenditures $ 429,987 $ 395,881 $ 300,719 Free cash flow (a) 760,443 512,145 950,836 (a) Calculated as net cash provided by operating activities, less capital expenditures for the period. Operating activities: The increase in net cash provided by operating activities in 2014 compared to 2013 was primarily due to a greater decrease in net inventory investment and larger increases in net income and accrued payroll-related liabilities in 2014 as compared to 2013. Net inventory investment reflects our investment in inventory, net of the amount of accounts payable to suppliers. Our net inventory investment continues to decrease as a result of the impact of our enhanced supplier financing programs. Our supplier financing programs enable us to reduce overall supply chain costs and negotiate extended payment terms with our suppliers. Our accounts payable to inventory ratio was 94.6% , 86.6% and 84.7% as of December 31, 2014, 2013 and 2012, respectively. The larger increase in our accounts payable to inventory ratio in 2014 was driven by continued strong supplier support. The increase in accrued payroll-related liabilities during 2014, as compared to 2013, was due to the timing of pay period end dates versus check dates and timing of payments for employer obligations under certain benefit plans. The decrease in cash provided by operating activities in 2013 compared to 2012 was primarily due to a smaller decrease in net inventory investment and a smaller increase in income taxes payable, offset in part by an increase in net income for the year. Our accounts payable to inventory ratio was 86.6%, 84.7% and 64.4% at December 31, 2013, 2012 and 2011, respectively. The smaller increase in our accounts payable to inventory ratio in 2013 is the result of a smaller increase in the number of new suppliers added to our financing programs versus the prior year. We launched our enhanced supplier financing program in January of 2011, and were able to add a large number of suppliers to the program during 2011 and 2012. The smaller increase in income taxes payable was primarily the result of a prepaid tax position at the beginning of 2012 versus a payable position at the beginning of 2013. 29 Investing activities: The increase in net cash used in investing activities in 2014 compared to 2013 was primarily the result of an increase in capital expenditures during 2014 related to the mix of owned versus leased new stores as compared to the prior year, as well as an increase in the number of new store openings. Total capital expenditures were $430 million and $396 million in 2014 and 2013 , respectively. The increase in net cash used in investing activities in 2013 compared to 2012 was primarily the result of an increase in capital expenditures during 2013 related to the purchase and construction of new distribution facilities during 2013 to support our ongoing store growth, as well as an increase in the number of new store openings. Total capital expenditures were $396 million and $301 million in 2013 and 2012 , respectively. We opened 200 , 190 , and 180 net, new stores in 2014 , 2013 , and 2012 , respectively, and acquired 56 stores in 2012. We plan to open 205 net, new stores in 2015 . The costs associated with the opening of a new store (including the cost of land acquisition, building improvements, fixtures, vehicles, net inventory investment and computer equipment) are estimated to average approximately $1.3 million to $1.5 million ; however, such costs may be significantly reduced where we lease, rather than purchase, the store site. Financing activities: The increase in net cash used in financing activities during 2014 compared to 2013 was primarily attributable to the net proceeds from the issuance of long-term senior notes during 2013, partially offset by the impact of fewer share repurchases of our common stock during the current year under our share repurchase program. The decrease in net cash used in financing activities during 2013 compared to 2012 was primarily attributable to the impact of fewer share repurchases of our common stock during 2013 under our share repurchase program. Unsecured revolving credit facility: On January 14, 2011, we entered into a credit agreement, as amended by Amendment No. 1 dated as of September 9, 2011, and as further amended by Amendment No. 2 dated as of July 2, 2013 (the "Credit Agreement"). The Credit Agreement provides for a $600 million unsecured revolving credit facility ("Revolving Credit Facility") arranged by Bank of America, N.A., which is scheduled to mature in July of 2018. The Credit Agreement includes a $200 million sub-limit for the issuance of letters of credit and a $75 million sub-limit for swing line borrowings. As described in the Credit Agreement governing the Revolving Credit Facility, we may, from time to time subject to certain conditions, increase the aggregate commitments under the Revolving Credit Facility by up to $200 million . We had outstanding letters of credit, primarily to support obligations related to workers' compensation, general liability and other insurance policies, in the amount of $48 million and $52 million as of December 31, 2014 and 2013 , respectively, reducing the aggregate availability under the Revolving Credit Facility by those amounts. As of December 31, 2014 and 2013 , we had no outstanding borrowings under the Revolving Credit Facility. Senior Notes: We have issued $1.4 billion aggregate principal amount of unsecured senior notes due between 2021 and 2023 with United Missouri Bank, N.A. as trustee. Interest on the unsecured senior notes of 3.800% to 4.875% is payable semi-annually and is computed on the basis of a 360 -day year. The senior notes are guaranteed on a senior unsecured basis by each of the Company's subsidiaries ("Subsidiary Guarantors") that incurs or guarantees obligations under our Credit Agreement or under other credit facility or capital markets debt of ours or any of our Subsidiary Guarantors. The guarantees are joint and several and full and unconditional, subject to certain customary automatic release provisions, including release of the Subsidiary Guarantor's guarantee under our Credit Agreement and certain other debt, or, in certain circumstances, the sale or other disposition of a majority of the voting power of the capital interest in, or of all or substantially all the property of, the Subsidiary Guarantor. Each of the Subsidiary Guarantors is 100% owned, directly or indirectly, by us and we have no independent assets or operations other than those of our subsidiaries. Our only direct or indirect subsidiaries that would not be Subsidiary Guarantors would be minor subsidiaries. Neither we, nor any of our Subsidiary Guarantors, are subject to any material or significant restrictions on our ability to obtain funds from our subsidiaries by dividend or loan or to transfer assets from such subsidiaries, except as provided by applicable law. Each of our senior notes is subject to certain customary covenants, with which we complied as of December 31, 2014 . Debt covenants: The indentures governing our senior notes contain covenants that limit our ability and the ability of certain of our subsidiaries to, among other things: (i) create certain liens on assets to secure certain debt; (ii) enter into certain sale and leaseback transactions; and (iii) merge or consolidate with another company or transfer all or substantially all of our or its property, in each case as set forth in the indentures. These covenants are, however, subject to a number of important limitations and exceptions. The Credit Agreement contains certain covenants, including limitations on indebtedness, a minimum consolidated fixed charge coverage ratio of 2.25 times from March 31, 2013, through December 31, 2014, and 2.50 times thereafter through maturity, and a maximum consolidated leverage ratio of 3.00 times through maturity. The consolidated leverage ratio includes a calculation of adjusted debt to 30 earnings before interest, taxes, depreciation, amortization, rent and non-cash share-based compensation expense ("EBITDAR"). Adjusted debt includes outstanding debt, outstanding stand-by letters of credit and similar instruments, six-times rent expense and excludes any premium or discount recorded in conjunction with the issuance of long-term debt. In the event that we should default on any covenant contained within the Credit Agreement, certain actions may be taken, including, but not limited to, possible termination of commitments, immediate payment of outstanding principal amounts plus accrued interest and other amounts payable under the Credit Agreement and litigation from our lenders. We had a consolidated fixed charge coverage ratio of 5.36 times and 4.98 times as of December 31, 2014 and 2013 , respectively, and a consolidated leverage ratio of 1.72 times and 1.90 times as of December 31, 2014 and 2013 , respectively, remaining in compliance with all covenants related to the borrowing arrangements. Under our current financing plan, we have targeted an adjusted debt to EBITDAR ratio range of 2.00 times to 2.25 times. The table below outlines the calculations of the consolidated fixed charge coverage ratio and consolidated leverage ratio covenants, as defined in the Credit Agreement governing the Revolving Credit Facility, for the years ended December 31, 2014 and 2013 (dollars in thousands): For the Year Ended December 31, 2014 2013 GAAP net income $ 778,182 $ 670,292 Add: Interest expense 53,290 49,074 Rent expense 263,028 254,892 Provision for income taxes 444,000 388,650 Depreciation expense 193,418 183,220 Amortization expense (benefit) 787 (40 ) Non-cash share-based compensation 23,095 21,722 Non-GAAP EBITDAR $ 1,755,800 $ 1,567,810 Interest expense $ 53,290 $ 49,074 Capitalized interest 11,480 10,644 Rent expense 263,028 254,892 Total fixed charges $ 327,798 $ 314,610 Consolidated fixed charge coverage ratio 5.36 4.98 GAAP debt $ 1,396,640 $ 1,396,208 Stand-by letters of credit 47,861 51,715 Discount on senior notes 3,385 3,890 Six-times rent expense 1,578,168 1,529,352 Non-GAAP adjusted debt $ 3,026,054 $ 2,981,165 Consolidated leverage ratio 1.72 1.90 Free cash flow, the consolidated fixed charge coverage ratio and consolidated leverage ratio discussed and presented in the tables above are not derived in accordance with United States generally accepted accounting principles ("GAAP"). We do not, nor do we suggest investors should, consider such non-GAAP financial measures in isolation from, or as a substitute for, GAAP financial information. We believe that the presentation of our free cash flow, consolidated fixed charge coverage ratio and consolidated leverage ratio provides meaningful supplemental information to both management and investors and reflects the required covenants under our credit agreement. We include these items in judging our performance and believe this non-GAAP information is useful to investors as well. Material limitations of these non-GAAP measures are that such measures do not reflect actual GAAP amounts. We compensate for such limitations by presenting, in the tables above, a reconciliation to the most directly comparable GAAP measures. Share repurchase program: Under our share repurchase program, as approved by our Board of Directors, we may, from time to time, repurchase shares of our common stock, solely through open market purchases effected through a broker dealer at prevailing market prices, based on a variety of factors such as price, corporate trading policy requirements and overall market conditions. We may increase or otherwise modify, renew, suspend or terminate the share repurchase program at any time, without prior notice. As announced on February 5, 2014, August 13, 2014, and 31 February 4, 2015, our Board of Directors each time approved a resolution to increase the authorization amount under our share repurchase program by an additional $500 million , resulting in a cumulative authorization amount of $5.0 billion . Each additional $500 million authorization is effective for a three -year period beginning on their respective announcement date. The following table identifies shares of our common stock that have been repurchased as part of our publicly announced share repurchase program (in thousands, except per share data): For the Year Ended December 31, 2014 2013 Shares repurchased 5,743 8,529 Average price per share $ 150.86 $ 109.38 Total investment $ 866,398 $ 932,900 As of December 31, 2014 , we had $279 million remaining under our share repurchase program. Subsequent to the end of the year and through February 27, 2015 , we repurchased an additional 0.1 million shares of our common stock under our share repurchase program, at an average price of $197.48 , for a total investment of $28 million . We have repurchased a total of 46 million shares of our common stock under our share repurchase program since the inception of the program in January of 2011 and through February 27, 2015 , at an average price of $91.38 for a total aggregate investment of $4.2 billion . As of February 27, 2015 , we had approximately $752 million remaining under our share repurchase program. CONTRACTUAL OBLIGATIONS Our contractual obligations as of December 31, 2014 , included commitments for short and long-term debt arrangements, interest payments related to long-term debt, future payments under non-cancelable lease arrangements, self-insurance reserves, purchase obligations for construction contract commitments and other long-term liabilities, which are identified in the table below and are fully disclosed in Note 6 "Leasing," Note 9 "Share-Based Compensation and Benefit Plans" and Note 10 "Commitments" to the Consolidated Financial Statements. We expect to fund these commitments primarily with operating cash flows expected to be generated in the normal course of business or through borrowings under our Revolving Credit Facility. Deferred income taxes, as well as commitments with various suppliers for the purchase of inventory, are not reflected in the table below due to the absence of scheduled maturities, the nature of the account or the commitment's cancellation terms. Due to the absence of scheduled maturities, the timing of certain of these payments cannot be determined, except for amounts estimated to be payable in 2015 , which are included in "Current liabilities" on our Consolidated Balance Sheets. We record a reserve for potential liabilities related to uncertain tax positions, including estimated interest and penalties, which are fully disclosed in Note 13 "Income Taxes" to the Consolidated Financial Statements. These estimates are not included in the table below because the timing related to the realized deferred income taxes' ultimate resolution or settlement of these positions cannot be determined. As of December 31, 2014 , we recorded a net liability of $58 million related to these uncertain tax positions on our Consolidated Balance Sheets, all of which was included as a component of "Other liabilities". Payments Due By Period Total Before 1 Year Years 1 and 2 Years 3 and 4 Years 5 and Over (In thousands) Contractual Obligations: Long-term debt principal and interest payments (1) $ 1,844,781 $ 61,200 $ 122,400 $ 122,400 $ 1,538,781 Future minimum lease payments under capital leases (2) 25 25 Future minimum lease payments under operating leases (2) 2,021,511 252,098 460,191 368,126 941,096 Other obligations 1,200 600 600 Self-insurance reserves (3) 132,879 64,882 40,247 16,416 11,334 Construction commitments 65,871 65,871 Other long-term liabilities (4) 15,378 15,378 Total contractual cash obligations $ 4,081,645 $ 444,676 $ 623,438 $ 506,942 $ 2,506,589 (1) Our Revolving Credit Facility, which has a maximum aggregate commitment of $600 million and matures in July of 2018, bears interest (other than swing line loans), at our option, at either the Base Rate or Eurodollar Rate (both as defined in the agreement) plus a margin, that will vary from 0.875% to 1.250% in the case of loans bearing interest at the Eurodollar Rate and 0.000% to 0.250% in the case of loans bearing interest at 32 the Base Rate, in each case based upon the better of the ratings assigned to our debt by Moody's Investor Service, Inc. and Standard & Poor's Rating Services, subject to limited exceptions. Swing line loans made under the Revolving Credit Facility bear interest at the Base Rate plus the applicable margin described above. In addition, we pay a facility fee on the aggregate amount of the commitments in an amount equal to a percentage of such commitments, varying from 0.125% to 0.250% per annum based upon the better of the ratings assigned to our debt by Moody's Investor Service, Inc. and Standard & Poor's Rating Services, subject to limited exceptions. Based on our credit ratings at December 31, 2014, our margin for Base Rate loans was 0.000% , our margin for Eurodollar Rate loans was 0.975% and our facility fee was 0.150% . As of December 31, 2014 , we had no outstanding borrowings under our Revolving Credit Facility. Based upon our current credit ratings, our current margin for Base Rate loans is 0.000% , our margin for Eurodollar Rate loans is 0.875% and our facility fee is 0.125% (2) The minimum lease payments above do not include certain tax, insurance and maintenance costs, which are also required contractual obligations under our operating leases but are generally not fixed and can fluctuate from year to year. These expenses historically average approximately 20% of the corresponding lease payments. (3) We use various self-insurance mechanisms to provide for potential liabilities from workers' compensation, vehicle and general liability, and employee health care benefits. The self-insurance reserves above are at the undiscounted obligation amount. The self-insurance reserves liabilities are recorded on our Consolidated Balance Sheets at our estimate of their net present value and do not have scheduled maturities; however, we can estimate the timing of future payments based upon historical patterns. (4) The projected obligation related to future payments under the Company's nonqualified deferred compensation plan, the timing of which cannot be estimated. See Note 9 "Share-Based Compensation and Benefit Plans" to the Consolidated Financial Statements for further information on the Company's compensation plans. OFF-BALANCE SHEET ARRANGEMENTS Off-balance sheet arrangements are transactions, agreements, or other contractual arrangements with an unconsolidated entity for which we have an obligation to the entity that is not recorded in our consolidated financial statements. We historically utilized various off-balance sheet financial instruments, including sale-leaseback and synthetic lease transactions, but we have not entered into any such transactions for over five years and do not plan to utilize off-balance sheet arrangements in the future to fund our working capital requirements, operations or growth plans. We issue stand-by letters of credit provided by a $200 million sub limit under the Revolving Credit Facility that reduce our available borrowings under the Revolving Credit Facility. Those letters of credit are issued primarily to satisfy the requirements of workers compensation, general liability and other insurance policies. Substantially all of the outstanding letters of credit have a one-year term from the date of issuance. Letters of credit totaling $48 million and $52 million were outstanding at December 31, 2014 and 2013 , respectively. Other than in connection with executing operating leases, we do not have any off-balance sheet financing that has, or is reasonably likely to have, a material, current or future effect on our financial condition, cash flows, results of operations, liquidity, capital expenditures or capital resources. See "Contractual Obligations" and Note 10 "Commitments" to the Consolidated Financial Statements for information on our operating leases. CRITICAL ACCOUNTING POLICIES AND ESTIMATES The preparation of our financial statements in accordance with GAAP requires the application of certain estimates and judgments by management. Management bases its assumptions, estimates, and adjustments on historical experience, current trends and other factors believed to be relevant at the time the consolidated financial statements are prepared. Management believes that the following policies are critical due to the inherent uncertainty of these matters and the complex and subjective judgments required in establishing these estimates. Management continues to review these critical accounting policies and estimates to ensure that the consolidated financial statements are presented fairly in accordance with GAAP. However, actual results could differ from our assumptions and estimates and such differences could be material. Inventory Obsolescence and Shrink Inventory, which consists of automotive hard parts, maintenance items, accessories and tools, is stated at the lower of cost or market. The extended nature of the life cycle of our products is such that the risk of obsolescence of our inventory is minimal. The products that we sell generally have applications in our markets for a relatively long period of time in conjunction with the corresponding vehicle population. We have developed sophisticated systems for monitoring the life cycle of a given product and, accordingly, have historically been very successful in adjusting the volume of our inventory in conjunction with a decrease in demand. We do record a reserve to reduce the carrying value of our inventory through a charge to cost of sales in the isolated instances where we believe that the market value of a product line is lower than our recorded cost. This reserve is based on our assumptions about the marketability of our existing inventory and is subject to uncertainty to the extent that we must estimate, at a given point in time, the market value of inventory that will be sold in future periods. Ultimately, our projections could differ from actual results and could result in a material impact to our stated inventory balances. We have historically not had to materially adjust our obsolescence reserves due to the factors discussed above and do not anticipate that we will experience material changes in our estimates in the future. 33 We also record a reserve to reduce the carrying value of our perpetual inventory to account for quantities in our perpetual records above the actual existing quantities on hand caused by unrecorded shrink. We estimate this reserve based on the results of our extensive and frequent cycle counting programs and periodic, full physical inventories. To the extent that our estimates do not accurately reflect the actual unrecorded inventory shrinkage, we could potentially experience a material impact to our inventory balances. We have historically been able to provide a timely and accurate measurement of shrink and have not experienced material adjustments to our estimates. If the shrink reserve changed 10% from the estimate that we recorded based on our historical experience at December 31, 2014 , the financial impact would have been approximately $1 million or 0.1% of pretax income for the year ended December 31, 2014 . Valuation of Long-Lived Assets and Goodwill - We evaluate the carrying value of long-lived assets for impairment whenever events or changes in circumstances indicate the carrying value of these assets might exceed their current fair values. As part of the evaluation, we review performance at the store level to identify any stores with current period operating losses that should be considered for impairment. A potential impairment has occurred if the projected future undiscounted cash flows realized from the best possible use of the asset are less than the carrying value of the asset. The estimate of cash flows includes management's assumptions of cash inflows and outflows directly resulting from the use of that asset in operations. If the carrying amount of an asset exceeds its estimated future cash flows, an impairment charge is recognized for the amount by which the carrying amount of the asset exceeds the fair value of the assets. Our impairment analyses contain estimates due to the inherently judgmental nature of forecasting long-term estimated cash flows and determining the ultimate useful lives and fair values of the assets. Actual results could differ from these estimates, which could materially impact our impairment assessment. We review goodwill for impairment annually during the fourth quarter, or when events or changes in circumstances indicate the carrying value of these assets might exceed their current fair values. We have never recorded an impairment to goodwill. The process of evaluating goodwill for impairment involves the determination of the fair value of our Company using the market approach. Inherent in such fair value determinations are certain judgments and estimates, including estimates which incorporate assumptions marketplace participants would use in making their estimates of fair value. In the future, if events or market conditions affect the estimated fair value to the extent that an asset is impaired, we will adjust the carrying value of these assets in the period in which the impairment occurs; however, we do not believe there has been any change of events or circumstances that would indicate that a reevaluation of goodwill is required as of December 31, 2014 , nor do we believe goodwill is at risk of failing impairment testing. If the price of O'Reilly stock, which was a primary input used to determine our market capitalization during step one of goodwill impairment testing, changed by 10% from the value used during testing, the results and our conclusions would not have changed and no further steps would have been required. Supplier Concessions We receive concessions from our suppliers through a variety of programs and arrangements, including co-operative advertising, allowances for warranties, merchandise allowances and volume purchase rebates. Co-operative advertising allowances that are incremental to our advertising program, specific to a product or event and identifiable for accounting purposes, are reported as a reduction of advertising expense in the period in which the advertising occurred. All other material supplier concessions are recognized as a reduction to the cost of sales. Amounts receivable from suppliers also include amounts due to us relating to supplier purchases and product returns. Management regularly reviews amounts receivable from suppliers and assesses the need for a reserve for uncollectible amounts based on our evaluation of our suppliers' financial position and corresponding ability to meet their financial obligations. Based on our historical results and current assessment, we have not recorded a reserve for uncollectible amounts in our consolidated financial statements, and we do not believe there is a reasonable likelihood that our ability to collect these amounts will differ from our expectations. The eventual ability of our suppliers to pay us the obliged amounts could differ from our assumptions and estimates, and we may be exposed to losses or gains that could be material. Warranty Reserves We offer warranties on certain merchandise we sell with warranty periods ranging from 30 days to limited lifetime warranties. The risk of loss arising from warranty claims is typically the obligation of our suppliers. Certain suppliers provide upfront allowances to us in lieu of accepting the obligation for warranty claims. For this merchandise, when sold, we bear the risk of loss associated with the cost of warranty claims. Differences between supplier allowances received in lieu of warranty obligations and estimated warranty expense are recorded as an adjustment to cost of sales. Estimated warranty costs, which are recorded as obligations at the time of sale, are based on the historical failure rate of each individual product line. Our historical experience has been that failure rates are relatively consistent over time and that the ultimate cost of warranty claims has been driven by volume of units sold as opposed to fluctuations in failure rates or the variation of the cost of individual claims. If warranty reserves were changed 10% from our estimated reserves at December 31, 2014 , the financial impact would have been approximately $3 million or 0.3% of pretax income for the year ended December 31, 2014 . Self-Insurance Reserves We use a combination of insurance and self-insurance mechanisms to provide for potential liabilities from workers' compensation, general liability, vehicle liability, property loss, and Team Member health care benefits. With the exception of certain Team Member health care benefit liabilities, employment related claims and litigation, certain commercial litigation and certain regulatory matters, we obtain third-party insurance coverage to limit our exposure for any individual workers' compensation, general liability, vehicle liability or property loss claim. When estimating our self-insurance liabilities, we consider 34 a number of factors, including historical claims experience and trend-lines, projected medical and legal inflation, and growth patterns and exposure forecasts. The assumptions made by management as they relate to each of these factors represent our judgment as to the most probable cumulative impact of each factor to our future obligations. Our calculation of self-insurance liabilities requires management to apply judgment to estimate the ultimate cost to settle reported claims and claims incurred but not yet reported as of the balance sheet date and the application of alternative assumptions could result in a different estimate of these liabilities. Actual claim activity or development may vary from our assumptions and estimates, which may result in material losses or gains. As we obtain additional information that affects the assumptions and estimates we used to recognize liabilities for claims incurred in prior accounting periods, we adjust our self-insurance liabilities to reflect the revised estimates based on this additional information. These liabilities are recorded at our estimate of their net present value, using a credit-adjusted discount rate. These liabilities do not have scheduled maturities, but we can estimate the timing of future payments based upon historical patterns. We could apply alternative assumptions regarding the timing of payments or the applicable discount rate that could result in materially different estimates of the net present value of the liabilities. If self-insurance reserves were changed 10% from our estimated reserves at December 31, 2014 , the financial impact would have been approximately $12 million or 1.0% of pretax income for the year ended December 31, 2014 . Legal Reserves We maintain reserves for expenses associated with litigation for which O'Reilly is currently involved. We are currently involved in litigation incidental to the ordinary conduct of our business. We resolved the governmental investigations and litigation that were being conducted against CSK Auto Corporation ("CSK") and certain of CSK's former employees for alleged conduct relating to periods prior to the 2008 acquisition date. As a result of the acquisition, we incurred legal fees and costs related to such investigations, litigation and indemnity obligations. Our legal reserve was principally recorded as an assumed liability in our allocation of the purchase price of CSK. Management, with the assistance of outside legal counsel, must make estimates of potential legal obligations and possible liabilities arising from such litigation and records reserves for these expenditures. If legal reserves were changed 10% from our estimated reserves at December 31, 2014 , the financial impact would have been approximately $2 million or 0.2% of pretax income for the year ended December 31, 2014 . Taxes We operate within multiple taxing jurisdictions and are subject to audit in these jurisdictions. These audits can involve complex issues, which may require an extended period of time to resolve. We regularly review our potential tax liabilities for tax years subject to audit. The amount of such liabilities is based on various factors, such as differing interpretations of tax regulations by the responsible tax authority, experience with previous tax audits and applicable tax law rulings. Changes in our tax liability may occur in the future as our assessments change based on the progress of tax examinations in various jurisdictions and/or changes in tax regulations. In management's opinion, adequate provisions for income taxes have been made for all years presented. The estimates of our potential tax liabilities contain uncertainties because management must use judgment to estimate the exposures associated with our various tax positions and actual results could differ from our estimates. Alternatively, we could have applied assumptions regarding the eventual outcome of the resolution of open tax positions that could differ from our current estimates but that would still be reasonable given the nature of a particular position. While our estimates are subject to the uncertainty noted in the preceding discussion, our initial estimates of our potential tax liabilities have historically not been materially different from actual results except in instances where we have reversed liabilities that were recorded for periods that were subsequently closed with the applicable taxing authority. INFLATION AND SEASONALITY For the last three fiscal years, we have generally been successful in reducing the effects of merchandise cost increases principally by taking advantage of supplier incentive programs, economies of scale resulting from increased volume of purchases and selective forward buying. To the extent our acquisition cost increased due to base commodity price increases industry-wide, we have typically been able to pass along these increased costs through higher retail prices for the affected products. As a result, we do not believe inflation has had a material adverse effect on our operations. To some extent, our business is seasonal primarily as a result of the impact of weather conditions on customer buying patterns. While we have historically realized operating profits in each quarter of the year, our store sales and profits have historically been higher in the second and third quarters (April through September) than in the first and fourth quarters (October through March) of the year. QUARTERLY RESULTS The following table sets forth certain quarterly unaudited operating data for fiscal 2014 and 2013 . The unaudited quarterly information includes all adjustments which management considers necessary for a fair presentation of the information shown. The unaudited operating data presented below should be read in conjunction with our consolidated financial statements and related notes included elsewhere in this annual report, and the other financial information included therein. 35 Fiscal 2014 First Quarter Second Quarter Third Quarter Fourth Quarter (In thousands, except per share and comparable store sales data) Comparable store sales 6.3 % 5.1 % 6.2 % 6.3 % Sales $ 1,727,943 $ 1,847,088 $ 1,876,872 $ 1,764,178 Gross profit 877,716 950,877 968,201 912,107 Operating income 287,120 336,474 343,768 303,012 Net income 173,860 205,647 216,997 181,678 Earnings per share basic (1) $ 1.64 $ 1.94 $ 2.10 $ 1.79 Earnings per share assuming dilution (1) $ 1.61 $ 1.91 $ 2.06 $ 1.76 Fiscal 2013 First Quarter Second Quarter Third Quarter Fourth Quarter (In thousands, except per share and comparable store sales data) Comparable store sales 0.6 % 6.5 % 4.6 % 5.4 % Sales $ 1,585,009 $ 1,714,969 $ 1,728,025 $ 1,621,234 Gross profit 798,663 871,875 879,163 819,300 Operating income 251,084 296,261 300,380 255,760 Net income 154,329 177,127 186,489 152,347 Earnings per share basic (1) $ 1.38 $ 1.61 $ 1.72 $ 1.43 Earnings per share assuming dilution (1) $ 1.36 $ 1.58 $ 1.69 $ 1.40 (1) Earnings per share amounts are computed independently for each quarter and annual period.

RECENT ACCOUNTING PRONOUNCEMENTS In May of 2014, the Financial Accounting Standards Board ("FASB") issued Accounting Standard No. 2014-09, "Revenue from Contracts with Customers (Topic 606)" ("ASU 2014-09"). Under ASU 2014-09, an entity is required to follow a five-step process to determine the amount of revenue to recognize when promised goods or services are transferred to customers. ASU 2014-09 offers specific accounting guidance for costs to obtain or fulfill a contract with a customer. In addition, an entity is required to disclose sufficient information to understand the nature, amount, timing, and uncertainty of revenue and cash flows arising from contracts with customers. ASU 2014-09 is effective for annual reporting periods beginning after December 15, 2016, including periods within that reporting period, and can be adopted either retrospectively or as a cumulative effect adjustment at the date of adoption, with early adoption not permitted. We will adopt this guidance beginning with our first quarter ending March 31, 2017; we are in the process of evaluating the potential future impact, if any, of ASU 2014-09 on our consolidated financial position, results of operations and cash flows. In August of 2014, the FASB issued ASU No. 2014-15, "Presentation of Financial Statements - Going Concern (Subtopic 205-40)" ("ASU 2014-15"). ASU 2014-15 will require management to assess an entity's ability to continue as a going concern for each annual and interim reporting period and to provide related footnote disclosure in circumstances in which substantial doubt exists. ASU 2014-15 is effective for annual periods ending after December 15, 2016, and for annual periods and interim periods thereafter, with early application permitted. We will apply this guidance beginning with our annual period ending December 31, 2016; the application of this guidance affects disclosure only and, therefore, it is not expected to have a material impact on our consolidated financial condition, results of operations or cash flows.
