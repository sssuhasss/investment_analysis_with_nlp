Item 7. MANAGEMENT S DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS OF FINANCIAL CONDITION AND RESULTS OF OPERATIONS The following Management Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations contains forward-looking statements that involve risks and uncertainties. Our actual results may differ materially from the results discussed in the forward-looking statements. Factors that might cause a difference include, but are not limited to, those discussed under Item 1A. Risk Factors in this Annual Report on Form 10-K. The following section is qualified in its entirety by the more detailed information, including our financial statements and the notes thereto, which appears elsewhere in this Annual Report. Overview Organization We are a diversified, global company that provides products, services and solutions to enhance the quality and comfort of air in homes and buildings, transport and protect food and perishables, secure homes and commercial properties, and increase industrial productivity and efficiency. Our business segments consist of Climate Solutions, Residential Solutions, Industrial Technologies and Security Technologies, each with strong brands and leading positions within their respective markets. We generate revenue and cash primarily through the design, manufacture, sale and service of a diverse portfolio of industrial and commercial products that include well-recognized, premium brand names such as Club Car , Ingersoll-Rand , Schlage , Thermo King and Trane . To achieve our mission of becoming a world leader in creating safe, comfortable and efficient environments, as well as to become a more diversified company with strong growth and profitability prospects, we began transforming our enterprise portfolio in recent years by divesting cyclical, low-growth and asset-intensive businesses. In addition, our acquisition strategy has helped deliver more consistent revenue and earnings performance across all phases of the economic cycle. Aside from our portfolio transformation, we continue to focus on increasing our recurring revenue stream from parts, service, used equipment and rentals; and to continuously improve the efficiencies and capabilities of the products and services of our high-potential businesses. We also continue to focus on operational excellence strategies as a central theme to improving our Company. On July 1, 2009, IR-Limited, a Bermuda company, completed a reorganization to change the jurisdiction of incorporation of our parent company from Bermuda to Ireland. As a result, IR-Ireland replaced IR-Limited as the ultimate parent company effective July 1, 2009. The Ireland Reorganization was accounted for as a reorganization of entities under common control and accordingly, did not result in any changes to the consolidated amounts of assets, liabilities and equity. In conjunction with the Ireland Reorganization, IR-Limited became a wholly-owned subsidiary of IR-Ireland and the Class A common shareholders of IR-Limited became ordinary shareholders of IR-Ireland. All references related to the Company prior to July 1, 2009 relate to IR-Limited. The Ireland Reorganization did not have a material impact on our financial results. IR-Ireland continues to be subject to SEC reporting requirements and prepares financial statements in accordance with GAAP. Shares of IR-Ireland continue to trade on the New York Stock Exchange under the symbol IR , the same symbol under which the IR-Limited Class A common shares previously traded. Trends and Economic Events We are a global corporation with worldwide operations. As a global business, our operations are affected by worldwide, regional and industry-specific economic factors, as well as political factors, wherever we operate or do business. Our geographic and industry diversity, as well as the diversity of our product sales and services, has helped mitigate the impact of any one industry or the economy of any single country on our consolidated operating results. Given the broad range of products manufactured and geographic markets served, management uses a variety of factors to predict the outlook for the Company. We monitor key competitors and customers in order to gauge relative performance and the outlook for the future. In addition, our order rates are indicative of future revenue and thus a key measure of anticipated performance. In those industry segments where we are a capital equipment provider, revenues depend on the capital expenditure budgets and spending patterns of our customers, who may delay or accelerate purchases in reaction to changes in their businesses and in the economy. Since the onset of the economic downturn in 2008, we have seen weaker demand for many of our products and services across each of our businesses. Current market conditions continue to impact our financial results. For example, depressed residential and consumer markets are impacting the operating results in our residential HVAC and golf equipment businesses. The residential HVAC business is also being impacted by a mix shift to units with a lower Seasonal Energy Efficiency Rating (SEER). Stagnant building activity is negatively impacting the results of our Security business. However, we have seen sustained recoveries in the worldwide industrial and refrigerated transport markets, global parts and service activity and across most of our businesses in 20 Table of Contents Asia. We believe the North American commercial HVAC market is also slowly recovering. As economic conditions continue to stabilize, we expect modest revenue growth along with the continued benefits of restructuring savings and productivity programs. Despite the current market environment, we believe we have a solid foundation of global brands and leading market shares in all of our major product lines. Our growing geographic and industry diversity coupled with our large installed product base provides growth opportunities within our service, parts and replacement revenue streams. In addition, we are investing substantial resources to innovate and develop new products and services which we expect will drive our future growth. Significant events in 2011 Dividend Increase and Share Repurchase Program In April 2011, we increased our quarterly stock dividend from $ 0.07 to $ 0.12 per share beginning with our June 2011 payment. In addition, our Board of Directors authorized the repurchase of up to $ 2.0 billion of our ordinary shares under a new share repurchase program. On June 8, 2011, we commenced share repurchases under this program. During the year ended December 31, 2011 , we repurchased 36.3 million shares for approximately $ 1.2 billion . These repurchases were accounted for as a reduction of Ordinary shares and Capital in excess of par value as they were canceled upon repurchase. In December 2011, we announced an increase in our quarterly stock dividend from $ 0.12 per share to $ 0.16 per share beginning with our March 2012 payment. Discontinued Operations On December 30, 2011, we completed the divestiture of our security installation and service business, which was sold under the Integrated Systems and Services brand in the United States and Canada, to Kratos Public Safety & Security Solutions, Inc. This business, which was previously reported as part of the Security Technologies segment, designs, installs and services security systems. As a result of the sale, we have reported this business as a discontinued operation for all periods presented. See "Divestitures and Discontinued Operations" within Management's Discussion and Analysis and also Note 17 to the Consolidated Financial Statements for a further discussion of our discontinued operations. Divested Operations On September 30, 2011, we completed a transaction to sell our Hussmann refrigerated display case business to a newly-formed affiliate (Hussmann Parent) of private equity firm Clayton Dubilier & Rice, LLC (CD&R). This transaction included the equipment business and certain of the service branches in the U.S. and Canada, and the equipment, service and installation businesses in Mexico, Chile, Australia, New Zealand, and Japan (Hussmann Business). The transaction allowed Hussmann Parent the option to acquire the remaining North American Hussmann service and installation branches (Hussmann Branches). Hussmann Parent completed the acquisition of the Hussmann Branches on November 30, 2011. The Hussmann Business and Branches, which were reported as part of the Climate Solutions segment through their respective transaction dates, manufacture, market, distribute, install, and service refrigerated display merchandising equipment, refrigeration systems, over the counter parts, and other commercial and industrial refrigeration applications. The assets and liabilities related to the Hussmann Business and Branches are classified as held for sale for all historical periods presented. However, the business does not qualify for treatment as a discontinued operation as the final deal terms included, among other things, an ongoing equity ownership interest by us in Hussmann Parent which now owns the Hussmann Business and Branches. See "Divestitures and Discontinued Operations" within Management's Discussion and Analysis and also Note 17 to the Consolidated Financial Statements for a further discussion of our divested operations. Venezuela Devaluation During the fourth quarter of 2009, the blended Consumer Price Index/National Consumer Price Index of Venezuela reached a cumulative three-year inflation rate in excess of 100%. As a result, Venezuela was designated as highly inflationary effective January 1, 2010. Accordingly, the U.S. dollar was determined to be the functional currency of our Venezuelan subsidiaries and all foreign currency fluctuations during 2011 and 2010 have been recorded in Other, net. At December 31, 2009, we remeasured our foreign currency receivables and payables associated with the Venezuelan Bolivar at the parallel rate of 6.0 Bolivars for each U.S. dollar. This was based on our inability to settle certain transactions through the official government channels in an expeditious manner. Previously, we remeasured all foreign currency transactions at the official rate of 2.15 Bolivars to the U.S. dollar. As a result, we recorded a $ 24 million charge in the fourth quarter of 2009 associated with the devaluation. On May 17, 2010, the government of Venezuela effectively closed down the parallel market claiming it was a significant cause of inflation in Venezuela. On June 9, 2010, a new parallel market (SITME) opened under control of the Central Bank at which time the Company began utilizing it for currency exchange, subject to any limitations under local regulations. Effective August 2011, we began utilizing the official rate (now 4.29 Bolivars to the U.S. dollar) for re-measurement purposes due to our increased ability to settle transactions at that rate. 21 Table of Contents Significant events in 2010 Discontinued Operations On December 30, 2010, we completed the divestiture of our gas microturbine generator business, which was sold under the Energy Systems brand, to Flex Energy, Inc. The business, which was previously reported as part of the Industrial Technologies segment, designs, manufactures, markets, distributes, and services gas powered microturbine generators which feature energy efficient design and low emissions technology. As a result of the sale, we have reported this business as a discontinued operation for all periods presented. On October 4, 2010, we completed the divestiture of our European refrigerated display case business, which was sold under the KOXKA brand, to an affiliate of American Industrial Acquisition Corporation (AIAC Group). The business, which was previously reported as part of the Climate Solutions segment, designs, manufactures and markets commercial refrigeration equipment through sales branches and a network of distributors throughout Europe, Africa and the Middle East. As a result of the sale, we have reported this business as a discontinued operation for all periods presented. See "Divestitures and Discontinued Operations" within Management's Discussion and Analysis and also Note 17 to the Consolidated Financial Statements for a further discussion of our discontinued operations. Healthcare Reform In March 2010, the Patient Protection and Affordable Care Act and the Healthcare and Education Reconciliation Bill of 2010 (collectively, the Healthcare Reform Legislation) were signed into law. As a result, effective 2013, the tax benefits available to us will be reduced to the extent our prescription drug expenses are reimbursed under the Medicare Part D retiree drug subsidy program. Although the provisions of the Healthcare Reform Legislation relating to the retiree drug subsidy program do not take effect until 2013, we are required to recognize the full accounting impact in our financial statements in the reporting period in which the Healthcare Reform Legislation is enacted. As retiree healthcare liabilities and related tax impacts are already reflected in our financial statements, the Healthcare Reform Legislation resulted in a non-cash charge to income tax expense in the first quarter of 2010 of $ 40.5 million . Currently, our retiree medical plans receive the retiree drug subsidy under Medicare Part D. No later than 2014, a significant portion of the drug coverage will be moved to an Employer Group Waiver Plan while retaining the same benefit provisions. This change resulted in an actuarial gain which decreased our December 31, 2010 retiree medical plan liability, as well as the net actuarial losses in other comprehensive income by $ 41.1 million . We will continue to monitor the Healthcare Reform Legislation to review provisions which could impact our accounting for retiree medical benefits in future periods. We may consider future plan amendments, which may have accounting implications as further regulations are promulgated and interpretations of the legislation become available. Additionally, we continue to monitor the individual market place for post-65 retiree medical coverage and will consider amendments to our health plans, which may have accounting implications on our plans. The Healthcare Reform Legislation could also impact our accounting for income taxes in future periods. We will continue to assess the accounting implications of the Healthcare Reform Legislation. Significant events in 2009 In the fourth quarter of 2009, we realigned our external reporting structure to more closely reflect our corporate and business strategies and to promote additional productivity and growth. Our segments are as follows: Climate Solutions, Residential Solutions, Industrial Technologies and Security Technologies. As part of the change, we eliminated the Air Conditioning Systems and Services segment which represented the acquired Trane business and created two new reportable segments, the Climate Solutions segment and the Residential Solutions segment. During 2009, we completed a comprehensive financing program that significantly enhanced our liquidity and debt profile. Significant actions included the repayment of the outstanding balance of our senior unsecured bridge loan facility with the proceeds from the issuance of $ 1.0 billion of long-term debt (Senior Notes and Exchangeable Senior Notes) and the expansion of our Trane accounts receivable purchase program to encompass originators from all four of our business segments. In addition, we reduced our quarterly stock dividend from $ 0.18 per share to $ 0.07 per share, effective with our September 2009 payment. On February 17, 2010, we terminated the expanded accounts receivable purchase program prior to its expiration in March 2010. In the fourth quarter of 2008, we initiated enterprise-wide restructuring actions in order to streamline both our manufacturing footprint and our general and administrative cost base. We incurred approximately $109.0 million of costs associated with this program during 2009. These combined restructuring actions generated approximately $155 million of annual pretax savings for 2010. We continue to invest in ongoing restructuring activities in an effort to increase efficiencies across all of our businesses. 22 Table of Contents Results of Operations - For the years ended December 31 Dollar amounts in millions, except per share data 2011 % of Revenues 2010 % of Revenues 2009 % of Revenues Net revenues $ 14,782.0 $ 14,001.1 $ 13,009.1 Cost of goods sold (10,493.6 ) 71.0% (10,059.9 ) 71.9% (9,437.1 ) 72.5% Selling and administrative expenses (2,781.2 ) 18.8% (2,679.8 ) 19.1% (2,686.8 ) 20.7% Loss on sale/asset impairment (646.9 ) 4.4% Operating income 860.3 5.8% 1,261.4 9.0% 885.2 6.8% Interest expense (280.0 ) (283.2 ) (301.6 ) Other, net 33.0 32.5 10.7 Earnings before income taxes 613.3 1,010.7 594.3 Provision for income taxes (187.2 ) (228.1 ) (81.5 ) Earnings from continuing operations 426.1 782.6 512.8 Discontinued operations, net of tax (56.8 ) (117.5 ) (36.6 ) Net earnings 369.3 665.1 476.2 Less: Net earnings attributable to noncontrolling interests (26.1 ) (22.9 ) (24.9 ) Net earnings attributable to Ingersoll-Rand plc $ 343.2 $ 642.2 $ 451.3 Diluted net earnings (loss) per ordinary share attributable to Ingersoll-Rand plc ordinary shareholders: Continuing operations $ 1.18 $ 2.24 $ 1.48 Discontinued operations (0.17 ) (0.35 ) (0.11 ) Net earnings $ 1.01 $ 1.89 $ 1.37 Net Revenues Net revenues for the year ended December 31, 2011 increased by 5.6% , or $ 780.9 million , compared with the same period of 2010 , which primarily resulted from the following: Volume/product mix 2.7 % Pricing 2.7 % Currency exchange rates 1.6 % Acquisitions/Divestitures 0.1 % Hussmann * (1.5 )% Total 5.6 % * Represents the impact of a partial year of operations for the Hussmann Business and Branches in 2011 . The increase in revenues was primarily driven by higher volumes and product mix experienced within the Climate Solutions and Industrial Technologies business segments, as well as improved pricing and favorable foreign currency impacts across all segments. 23 Table of Contents Net revenues for the year ended December 31, 2010 increased by 7.6% , or $ 992.0 million , compared with the same period of 2009 , which primarily resulted from the following: Volume/product mix 7.5 % Pricing 0.2 % Currency exchange rates 0.3 % Devaluation of Venezuelan Bolivar (0.5 )% Acquisitions 0.1 % Total 7.6 % The increase in revenues was primarily driven by higher volumes experienced within the Climate Solutions, Residential Solutions, and Industrial Technologies business segments, as well as favorable foreign currency impacts. However, the devaluation of the Venezuelan Bolivar had a $70.0 million impact on reported revenues during 2010. Operating Income/Margin Operating margin for the year ended December 31, 2011 decreased to 5.8% from 9.0% for the same period in 2010 . Included in Operating income for 2011 is a $ 646.9 million loss on sale/asset impairment charge related to the divestiture of Hussmann, which had a 4.4 point impact on 2011 operating margin. Excluding the loss on sale/asset impairment, operating margin increased by 1.2 points. The increase was primarily due to improved pricing across all sectors, the realization of benefits resulting from restructuring programs and productivity actions, and higher volumes. These improvements were partially offset by unfavorable revenue mix within our Residential Solutions and Security Technologies segments, as well as increased investment spending and increased material and other costs. Also included in Operating income for 2011 is a $ 23 million gain associated with the sale of assets from a restructured business in China. This gain had a 0.2 point impact on operating margin for 2011. Operating margin for the year ended December 31, 2010 increased to 9.0% from 6.8% for the same period in 2009 . The benefit of higher volumes, productivity actions and restructuring programs more than offset the negative effect of increased material costs. Also, included in Operating income was $ 45.3 million of charges associated with ongoing restructuring actions compared to $ 109.0 million recorded in 2009. These costs had a 0.3 point and 0.8 point impact on operating margin in 2010 and 2009 , respectively. Interest Expense Interest expense for the year ended December 31, 2011 decreased by $ 3.2 million compared with the same period of 2010 as a result of lower average debt balances in 2011 . Interest expense for the year ended December 31, 2010 decreased $ 18.4 million compared with the same period of 2009 as a result of lower average debt balances in 2010 . Other, Net The components of Other, net, for the year ended December 31 are as follows: In millions 2011 2010 2009 Interest income $ 25.9 $ 15.2 $ 12.6 Exchange gain (loss) 2.8 0.9 (36.2 ) Earnings (loss) from equity investments (3.5 ) Other 7.8 16.4 34.3 Other, net $ 33.0 $ 32.5 $ 10.7 For the year ended December 31, 2011 , Other, net increased by $ 0.5 million compared with the same period of 2010 . The increase in Other, net resulted from favorable currency impacts and increased interest income as a result of higher average cash balances during 2011 . Included within Earnings (loss) from equity investments for 2011, subsequent to the Hussmann divestiture transaction dates, is a $ 3.5 million equity loss on the Hussmann equity investment. For the year ended December 31, 2010 , Other, net increased by $ 21.8 million compared with the same period of 2009 . The increase was primarily driven by lower currency losses, which partially resulted from a $ 24 million charge recorded in 2009 associated with the devaluation of the Venezuelan Bolivar. The increase was partially offset by $ 25 million of income recorded in the fourth 24 Table of Contents quarter of 2009 primarily related to a favorable settlement with an insurance carrier associated with a portion of our asbestos obligation. The settlement is included in Other in the table above. We made a change in classification of certain earnings from equity investments deemed to be integral to our operations from Other, net to Cost of goods sold. This change in classification had a $ 9.8 million and $8.0 million impact, respectively, on the Consolidated Statement of Income for the years ended December 31, 2010 and 2009 . Provision for Income Taxes The 2011 tax provision of $ 187.2 million included an $ 88.9 million Hussmann related tax benefit. For the year ended December 31, 2011 , the effective tax rate, excluding the Hussmann Loss on sale/asset impairment and the Hussmann related tax benefit, was 21.9% compared to 22.6% in 2010 . The 2011 tax rate was below the U.S. Statutory rate of 35.0% primarily due to earnings in non-U.S. jurisdictions, which, in aggregate, have a lower effective rate and net changes in our valuation allowances, partially offset by the accrual of a previously unrecorded future withholding tax liability and net increases in our liability for unrecognized tax benefits. Included in the 2010 effective rate was a $40.5 million non-cash charge to income tax expense related to the Healthcare Reform Legislation, partially offset by net changes in our valuation allowance. For the year ended December 31, 2010 , the effective tax rate was 22.6% compared to 13.7% in 2009 . The 2010 tax rate was below the U.S. Statutory rate of 35.0% primarily due to earnings in non-U.S. jurisdictions, which, in aggregate, have a lower effective rate. The 8.9 point increase in the effective rate is primarily the result of a $ 40.5 million non-cash charge to income tax expense related to the Healthcare Reform Legislation as well as changes in geographical mix of earnings, offset by net changes in our valuation allowances. Review of Business Segments The segment discussions that follow describe the significant factors contributing to the changes in results for each segment included in continuing operations. Segment operating income is the measure of profit and loss that our chief operating decision maker uses to evaluate the financial performance of the business and as the basis for performance reviews, compensation and resource allocation. For these reasons, we believe that Segment operating income represents the most relevant measure of segment profit and loss. Management may exclude certain charges or gains from Operating income to arrive at a Segment operating income that is a more meaningful measure of profit and loss upon which to base its operating decisions. We define Segment operating margin as Segment operating income as a percentage of Net revenues. Climate Solutions Our Climate Solutions segment delivers energy-efficient refrigeration and Heating, Ventilation and Air Conditioning (HVAC) throughout the world. Encompassing the transport markets as well as the commercial HVAC markets, this segment offers customers a broad range of products, services and solutions to manage controlled temperature environments. This segment includes the market-leading brands of Thermo King and Trane. On September 30, 2011 and November 30, 2011, we completed transactions to sell the Hussmann Business and Branches, respectively, to a newly-formed affiliate (Hussmann Parent) of private equity firm Clayton Dubilier & Rice, LLC (CD&R). As part of the deal terms we have an ongoing equity interest in Hussmann Parent, therefore operating results continue to be recorded within Continuing Operations. However, subsequent to the respective transaction dates our earnings from this equity interest is not reported in Segment operating income. During the year ended December 31, 2011, we recorded a pre-tax loss on sale/asset impairment charge related to the Hussmann divestiture totaling $ 647 million . These charges have been excluded from Segment operating income within the Climate Solutions segment as management excludes these charges from Operating income when making operating decisions about the business. See "Divestitures and Discontinued Operations" within Management's Discussion and Analysis and also Note 17 to the Consolidated Financial Statements for a further discussion of our divested operations. 2011 Net revenues and Segment operating income for the Climate Solutions segment includes the operating results of the Hussmann Business and Branches for the nine months and eleven months, respectively, prior to the sale. The operating results for the Hussmann Business and Branches are included in Net revenues and Segment operating income for the Climate Solutions segment for the years ended December 31 as follows: In millions 2011 2010 2009 Net revenues $ 818.5 $ 1,106.1 $ 1,008.9 Segment operating income $ 58.6 $ 84.4 $ 19.4 25 Table of Contents On October 4, 2010, we completed the divestiture of our European refrigerated display case business, which was sold under the KOXKA brand, to an affiliate of American Industrial Acquisition Corporation (AIAC Group). The business, which was previously reported as part of the Climate Solutions segment, designs, manufactures and markets commercial refrigeration equipment through sales branches and a network of distributors throughout Europe, Africa and the Middle East. Segment information has been revised to exclude the results of this business for all periods presented. Segment results for the years ended December 31 were as follows: Dollar amounts in millions 2011 % change 2010 % change 2009 Net revenues $ 8,284.6 6.2% $ 7,800.8 8.2% $ 7,211.2 Segment operating income 824.6 37.8% 598.3 38.7% 431.3 Segment operating margin 10.0 % 7.7 % 6.0 % 2011 vs 2010 Net revenues for the year ended December 31, 2011 increased by 6.2% or $ 483.8 million , compared with the same period of 2010 , which primarily resulted from the following: Volume/product mix 4.6 % Pricing 2.3 % Currency exchange rates 1.8 % Acquisitions/Divestitures 0.1 % Hussmann * (2.6 )% Total 6.2 % * Represents the impact of a partial year of operations for the Hussmann Business and Branches in 2011 . Trane commercial HVAC revenues reflect market recovery within our equipment, systems, parts, services and solutions markets. Trane commercial HVAC revenues increased in all major geographic regions, with strong year-over-year improvements in the Americas, Asia, and Europe. Net revenues in our transport businesses experienced growth in most geographic areas due to improved activity within the refrigerated trailer and truck markets. In addition, sea-going container revenues and worldwide bus revenues improved due to an increase in end-market activity. Segment operating income for the year ended December 31, 2011 increased by 37.8% , or $ 226.3 million , compared with the same period of 2010 . The increase, which improved Segment operating margin to 10.0% from 7.7% , was primarily related to improved pricing ($180 million), net productivity benefits ($122 million), and higher volumes and product mix ($90 million). However, the benefits resulting from these improvements were partially offset by increased material costs ($151 million), increased investment spending ($28 million) and the impacts of only a partial year of operations for the Hussmann Business and Branches in 2011 ($10 million). Included in Segment operating income for 2011 was a $ 23 million gain associated with the sale of assets from a restructured business in China. This gain had a 0.3 point impact on Segment operating margin. 2010 vs 2009 Net revenues for the year ended December 31, 2010 increased by 8.2% or $ 589.6 million , compared with the same period of 2009 , which primarily resulted from the following: Volume/product mix 7.5 % Pricing 0.1 % Currency exchange rates 0.7 % Devaluation of the Venezuelan Bolivar (0.3 )% Acquisitions 0.2 % Total 8.2 % Net revenues in our transport and stationary refrigeration businesses experienced strong improvements in all geographic areas due to the refrigerated trailer and truck markets. In addition, sea-going container revenues and worldwide bus revenues improved due to an increase in end-market activity. Worldwide display cases and contracting revenue also increased due to recovering supermarket capital expenditures. Trane commercial HVAC revenues improved slighly as a result of increased revenue for parts, services and solutions. 26 Table of Contents Segment operating income for the year ended December 31, 2010 increased by 38.7% , or $ 167.0 million , compared with the same period of 2009 . The increase, which improved Segment operating margin to 7.7% from 6.0% , was primarily related to higher volumes and product mix ($178 million) and net productivity benefits ($115 million). However, the benefits resulting from these improvements were partially offset by increases in material costs ($101 million). Included in 2010 Segment operating income was $ 23.7 million of charges associated with ongoing restructuring actions, which had a 0.3 point impact on Segment operating margins. The comparable amount recorded in 2009 was $ 35.9 million , which had a 0.5 point impact on Segment operating margins. Residential Solutions Our Residential Solutions segment provides safety, comfort and efficiency to homeowners throughout North America and parts of South America. It offers customers a broad range of products, services and solutions including mechanical and electronic locks, energy-efficient HVAC systems, indoor air quality solutions, advanced controls, portable security systems and remote home management. This segment is comprised of well-known brands like American Standard, Schlage and Trane. Segment results for the years ended December 31 were as follows: Dollar amounts in millions 2011 % change 2010 % change 2009 Net revenues $ 2,012.7 (5.1)% $ 2,121.7 6.0% $ 2,001.5 Segment operating income 62.1 (67.5)% 191.3 46.5% 130.6 Segment operating margin 3.1 % 9.0 % 6.5 % 2011 vs. 2010 Net revenues for the year ended December 31, 2011 decreased by 5.1% or $ 109.0 million , compared with the same period of 2010 , which primarily resulted from the following: Volume/product mix (10.5 )% Pricing 5.1 % Currency exchange rates 0.3 % Total (5.1 )% Trane residential HVAC revenues were impacted by continued weakness in the U.S. new residential construction and replacement markets as well as a mix shift to lower SEER units. Residential security revenues increased as a result of improved sales to new builder markets and big box customers primarily during the fourth quarter. Segment operating income for the year ended December 31, 2011 decreased by 67.5% , or $ 129.2 million , compared with the same period of 2010 . The decrease, which lowered Segment operating margin to 3.1% from 9.0% , was primarily related to lower volumes and unfavorable product mix ($155 million), increased material costs ($82 million) and other inflation. However, these decreases were partially offset by improved pricing ($108 million). 2010 vs. 2009 Net revenues for the year ended December 31, 2010 increased by 6.0% or $ 120.2 million , compared with the same period of 2009 , which primarily resulted from the following: Volume/product mix 9.2 % Pricing (0.7 )% Devaluation of the Venezuelan Bolivar (2.5 )% Total 6.0 % Trane residential HVAC revenues were impacted by continued weakness in the U.S. new residential construction market. However, improved sales to the replacement market more than offset the effect of the new construction market. Excluding the impact of the devaluation of the Venezuelan Bolivar, revenues in the residential security business increased primarily as a result of improving remodeling markets and an increase in end-market activity in the U.S. new builder channel. Segment operating income for the year ended December 31, 2010 increased by 46.5% , or $ 60.7 million , compared with the same period of 2009 . The increase, which improved Segment operating margins to 9.0% from 6.5% , was primarily related to net productivity benefits ($68 million) and higher volumes and product mix ($43 million). However, the benefits resulting from these 27 Table of Contents improvements were partially offset by increased material costs ($21 million) and unfavorable pricing ($15 million). In addition, the devaluation of the Venezuelan Bolivar negatively impacted year-over-year results by $18.0 million. Industrial Technologies Our Industrial Technologies segment provides products, services and solutions that enhance energy efficiency, productivity and operations.

Segment information has been revised to exclude the results of this business for all periods presented. Segment results for the years ended December 31 were as follows: Dollar amounts in millions 2011 % change 2010 % change 2009 Net revenues $ 2,852.9 14.8 % $ 2,485.2 14.5 % $ 2,170.0 Segment operating income 415.5 33.9 % 310.4 73.9 % 178.5 Segment operating margin 14.6 % 12.5 % 8.2 % 2011 vs 2010 Net revenues for the year ended December 31, 2011 increased by 14.8% or $ 367.7 million , compared with the same period of 2010 , which primarily resulted from the following: Volume/product mix 10.3 % Pricing 2.7 % Currency exchange rates 1.8 % Total 14.8 % We experienced strong growth within our Air and Productivity business primarily due to increased volume in all major geographic regions. The revenue increase in the Americas was driven by improvements in our industrial and commercial markets for air compressors, tools, and fluid handling products. Club Car revenues also improved relative to the prior year primarily due to improved pricing. Segment operating income increased by 33.9% or $ 105.1 million during 2011 . The increase, which improved Segment operating margin to 14.6% from 12.5% was primarily related to improved pricing ($68 million), net productivity benefits ($64 million), and higher volumes and product mix ($60 million). However, these improvements were partially offset by increased material costs ($50 million) and increased investment spending ($15 million). 2010 vs 2009 Net revenues for the year ended December 31, 2010 increased by 14.5% or $ 315.2 million , compared with the same period of 2009 , which primarily resulted from the following: Volume/product mix 13.6 % Pricing 1.1 % Currency exchange rates (0.2 )% Total 14.5 % Air and Productivity revenues outside of the U.S. increased as improved aftermarket activity in Asia was partially offset by weaker markets in Europe. U.S. markets increased as the equipment market continues to improve. Club Car revenues increased as a result of improving golf markets. 28 Table of Contents Segment operating income increased by 73.9% or $ 131.9 million during 2010 . The increase, which improved Segment operating margin to 12.5% from 8.2% was primarily related to higher volumes and product mix ($91 million), net productivity benefits ($58 million), and favorable pricing ($23 million). However, these improvements were partially offset by increased material costs ($22 million). Included in 2010 Segment operating income was $ 17.9 million of charges associated with ongoing restructuring actions, which had a 0.7 point impact on Segment operating margin. The comparable amount recorded in 2009 was $ 27.1 million , which had a 1.2 point impact on 2009 Segment operating margin.

On December 30, 2011, we completed the divestiture of our security installation and service business, which was sold under the Integrated Systems and Services brand in the United States and Canada, to Kratos Public Safety & Security Solutions, Inc. This business, which was previously reported as part of the Security Technologies segment, designs, installs and services security systems. Segment information has been revised to exclude the results of this business for all periods presented. Segment results for the years ended December 31 were as follows: Dollar amounts in millions 2011 % change 2010 % change 2009 Net revenues $ 1,631.8 2.4% $ 1,593.4 (2.0)% $ 1,626.4 Segment operating income 331.6 1.0% 328.3 (0.1)% 328.6 Segment operating margin 20.3 % 20.6 % 20.2 % 2011 vs 2010 Net revenues for the year ended December 31, 2011 increased by 2.4% or $ 38.4 million , compared with the same period of 2010 , which primarily resulted from the following: Currency exchange rates 1.9 % Pricing 1.7 % Volume/product mix (1.2 )% Total 2.4 % The weakness in worldwide commercial building markets continues to impact segment revenues. However, our results reflect strong improvements in Asia, with slight improvements in North America and Europe. Segment operating income for the year ended December 31, 2011 increased by 1.0% or $ 3.3 million , compared with the same period of 2010 . Segment operating margin declined to 20.3% from 20.6% . The increase in Segment operating income was primarily related to improved pricing ($27 million), net productivity benefits ($24 million), and favorable currency impacts ($2 million). However, these improvements were partially offset by increased material costs ($22 million), unfavorable mix ($20 million), and increased investment spending. 2010 vs 2009 Net revenues for the year ended December 31, 2010 decreased by 2.0% or $ 33.0 million , compared with the same period of 2009 , which primarily resulted from the following: Volume/product mix (2.4 )% Pricing 0.8 % Currency exchange rates (0.4 )% Total (2.0 )% 29 Table of Contents The decline in worldwide commercial building and remodeling markets continued to impact segment revenues, especially in the United States. Slight improvement in Europe and modest volume increases in Asia helped mitigate continued weakness in the United States. Segment operating income for the year ended December 31, 2010 decreased by 0.1% or $ 0.3 million , compared with the same period of 2009. Segment operating margin improved to 20.6% from 20.2% . The segment operating results benefitted from net productivity ($55 million) and a reduction in restructuring activities in 2010. Included in 2010 Segment operating income was $ 3.1 million of charges associated with ongoing restructuring actions, which had a 0.2 point impact on Segment operating margin. The comparable amount recorded in 2009 was $ 23.9 million , which had a 1.5 point impact on 2009 Segment operating margin. These improvements were offset by a reduction in volumes and product mix ($48 million) and increases in material costs ($14 million). Divestitures and Discontinued Operations Divested Operations Hussmann Divestiture On September 30, 2011, we completed a transaction to sell our Hussmann refrigerated display case business to a newly-formed affiliate (Hussmann Parent) of private equity firm Clayton Dubilier & Rice, LLC (CD&R). This transaction included the equipment business and certain of the service branches in the U.S. and Canada, and the equipment, service and installation businesses in Mexico, Chile, Australia, New Zealand, and Japan (Hussmann Business). The transaction allowed Hussmann Parent the option to acquire the remaining North American Hussmann service and installation branches (Hussmann Branches). Hussmann Parent completed the acquisition of the Hussmann Branches on November 30, 2011. The Hussmann Business and Branches, which are reported as part of the Climate Solutions segment, manufacture, market, distribute, install, and service refrigerated display merchandising equipment, refrigeration systems, over the counter parts, and other commercial and industrial refrigeration applications. The Hussmann Business divestiture, which was originally announced on April 21, 2011 and anticipated to be a sale of 100% of our interest in the Hussmann Business, with no retained ongoing interest, met the criteria for classification as held for sale and for treatment as discontinued operations in accordance with GAAP during the first and second quarters of 2011. Therefore, we reported the Hussmann Business as a discontinued operation, classified the assets and liabilities as held for sale, and recognized $ 384 million of after-tax impairment losses in the first half of 2011 to write the net assets of the Hussmann Business down to their estimated fair value. We also recorded approximately $ 3 million of transaction costs during the first half of 2011 related to the sale. During the third quarter of 2011, we negotiated a transaction to sell the Hussmann Business and Branches to CD&R in exchange for $ 370 million in cash, subject to purchase price adjustments, and common stock of Hussmann Parent, such that following the sale, CD&R would own cumulative convertible participating preferred stock of Hussmann Parent, initially representing 60% of the outstanding capital stock (on an as-converted basis) of Hussmann Parent, and we would own all of the common stock, initially representing the remaining 40% of the outstanding capital stock (on an as-converted basis) of Hussmann Parent. The Hussmann Branches met the held for sale criteria outlined in GAAP. However, the Hussmann Business and Branches did not qualify for treatment as a discontinued operation as our equity interest in the Hussmann Parent represents significant continuing involvement. Therefore, the results of the Hussmann Business and Branches have been presented as continuing operations for all periods presented. For the Hussmann divestiture, we received consideration of $ 438 million for the Hussmann Business and Branches, which included cash consideration, after purchase price adjustments, of $ 351 million as well as the equity interest valued at $ 87 million . Accordingly, we recorded a pre-tax loss on sale/asset impairment charge of $ 260 million ($ 162 million after-tax) during the second half of 2011, which reflected net assets of $ 576 million , an accumulated other comprehensive loss of $ 86 million , an estimated indemnification obligation assumed of $ 27 million , and transaction costs of $ 9 million . Results for the Hussmann Business and Branches for the years ended December 31 are as follows: In millions 2011* 2010 2009 Net revenues $ 818.5 $ 1,106.1 $ 1,008.9 Loss on sale/asset impairment (646.9 ) ** Net earnings (loss) attributable to Ingersoll-Rand plc (513.1 ) 55.7 13.1 Diluted earnings (loss) per share attributable to Ingersoll-Rand plc ordinary shareholders: (1.51 ) 0.16 0.04 * Results represent the operating results of Hussmann Business and Branches through their respective divestiture transaction dates. ** Included in Loss on sale/asset impairment for the year ended December 31, 2011 are transaction costs of $ 12.2 million . 30 Table of Contents Our ownership interest in Hussmann Parent is reported using the equity method of accounting subsequent to September 30, 2011.

Compact Equipment manufactured and sold compact equipment, including skid-steer loaders, compact track loaders, mini-excavators and telescopic tool handlers; portable air compressors, generators and light towers; general-purpose light construction equipment; and attachments. We are in dispute, and are continuing to pursue other claims against Doosan Infracore, regarding post closing matters.

Other discontinued operations, net of tax from previously sold businesses is mainly related to postretirement benefits, product liability and legal costs (mostly asbestos-related), costs related to settlement of a lawsuit and tax effects of post closing purchase price adjustments. Liquidity and Capital Resources We earn a significant amount of our operating income in jurisdictions where it is deemed to be permanently reinvested. Our most prominent jurisdiction of operation is the U.S. We currently do not intend nor foresee a need to repatriate funds to the U.S., and no provision for U.S. income taxes has been made with respect to such earnings. We expect existing cash and cash equivalents available to the U.S., the cash generated by our U.S. operations, our committed credit lines as well as our expected ability to access the capital markets will be sufficient to fund our U.S. operating and capital needs for at least the next twelve months and thereafter for the foreseeable future. In addition, we expect existing non-U.S. cash and cash equivalents and the cash generated by our non-U.S. operations to be sufficient to fund our non-U.S. operating and capital needs for at least the next twelve months and thereafter for the foreseeable future. Should we require more capital in the U.S. than is generated by our U.S. operations, and we determined that repatriation of non-U.S. cash is necessary; such amounts would be subject to U.S. federal income taxes. In April 2011, we increased our quarterly stock dividend from $ 0.07 to $ 0.12 per share beginning with our June 2011 payment. In addition, our Board of Directors authorized the repurchase of up to $ 2.0 billion of our ordinary shares under a new share repurchase program. On June 8, 2011, we commenced share repurchases under this program. During the year ended December 31, 2011 , we repurchased 36.3 million shares for approximately $ 1.2 billion . These repurchases were accounted for as a reduction of Ordinary shares and Capital in excess of par value as they were canceled upon repurchase. In December 2011, we announced an increase in our quarterly stock dividend from $ 0.12 per share to $ 0.16 per share beginning with our March 2012 payment. 33 Table of Contents Liquidity The following table contains several key measures to gauge our financial condition and liquidity at the periods ended December 31: In millions 2011 2010 2009 Cash and cash equivalents $ 1,160.7 $ 1,014.3 $ 876.7 Short-term borrowings and current maturities of long-term debt 763.3 761.6 1,191.7 Long-term debt 2,879.3 2,922.3 2,904.9 Total debt 3,642.6 3,683.9 4,096.6 Total Ingersoll-Rand plc shareholders equity 6,924.3 7,964.3 7,071.8 Total equity 7,012.4 8,059.1 7,175.7 Debt-to-total capital ratio 34.2 % 31.3 % 36.2 % Short-term borrowings and current maturities of long-term debt at December 31 consisted of the following: In millions 2011 2010 Debentures with put feature $ 343.6 $ 343.6 Exchangeable Senior Notes 341.2 328.3 Current maturities of long-term debt 12.5 13.3 Other short-term borrowings 66.0 76.4 Total $ 763.3 $ 761.6 Commercial Paper Program The maximum aggregate amount of unsecured commercial paper notes available to be issued, on a private placement basis, under the Commercial Paper Program is $ 2 billion as of December 31, 2011 . Under the Commercial Paper Program, Ingersoll-Rand Global Holding Company Limited (IR-Global) may issue notes from time to time, and the proceeds of the financing will be used for general corporate purposes. Each of IR-Ireland, IR-Limited and Ingersoll-Rand International Holding Limited (IR-International) has provided an irrevocable and unconditional guarantee for the notes issued under the Commercial Paper Program. As of December 31, 2011 and 2010 , we had no amounts outstanding. Debentures with Put Feature At December 31, 2011 and 2010 , we had outstanding $ 343.6 million of fixed rate debentures, which only require early repayment at the option of the holder. These debentures contain a put feature that the holders may exercise on each anniversary of the issuance date. If exercised, we are obligated to repay in whole or in part, at the holder option, the outstanding principal amount (plus accrued and unpaid interest) of the debentures held by the holder. If these options are not exercised, the final maturity dates would range between 2027 and 2028 . In 2011, holders of these debentures chose not to exercise the put feature on outstanding debentures. Based on our cash flow forecast, we believe we will have sufficient liquidity to repay any amounts redeemable as a result of these put features. Exchangeable Senior Notes Due 2012 In April 2009, we issued $ 345 million of 4.5% Exchangeable Senior Notes (the Notes) through our wholly-owned subsidiary, IR-Global. The Notes are fully and unconditionally guaranteed by each of IR-Ireland, IR-Limited and IR-International. Interest on the Notes is paid twice a year in arrears. In addition, holders have the option to exchange their notes through their scheduled maturity in April 2012. Upon any exchange, the Notes will be paid in cash up to the aggregate principal amount of the notes to be exchanged. The remainder due on the option feature, if any, may be paid in cash, IR-Ireland ordinary shares or a combination thereof at the option of the Company. On November 14, 2011 we elected, for all future exercises, to settle the remainder due on the option feature in whole shares of IR-Ireland with cash in lieu of any fractional shares. The Notes are subject to certain customary covenants, however, none of these covenants are considered restrictive to our operations. We account for the Notes in accordance with GAAP, which required us to allocate the proceeds between debt and equity at the issuance date, in a manner that reflects our nonconvertible debt borrowing rate. We allocated approximately $ 305 million of the gross proceeds to debt, with the remaining discount of approximately $ 40 million (approximately $ 39 million after allocated fees) recorded within Equity. As of December 31, 2011, the Notes may be exchangeable at the holders option through their scheduled 34 Table of Contents maturity in April 2012. Therefore, the equity portion of the Notes is classified as Temporary equity to reflect the amount that could result in cash settlement at the balance sheet date. Additionally, we are amortizing the discount into Interest expense over a three-year period. Senior Notes Due 2014 In April 2009, we issued $ 655 million of 9.5% Senior Notes through our wholly-owned subsidiary, IR-Global. The notes are fully and unconditionally guaranteed by each of IR-Ireland, IR-Limited and IR-International. Interest on the fixed rate notes will be paid twice a year in arrears. We have the option to redeem them in whole or in part at any time, and from time to time, prior to their stated maturity date at redemption prices set forth in the indenture agreement. The notes are subject to certain customary covenants, however, none of these covenants are considered restrictive to our operations. Accounts Receivable Purchase Program On March 31, 2009, we expanded our existing Trane accounts receivable purchase program to encompass originators from all four of our business segments. For the year ended December 31, 2009, we recorded a cash outflow of approximately $ 63 million within cash flow from operations, which represented the decrease in the net interests of the receivables sold to the conduits administered by unaffiliated financial institutions. On February 17, 2010, we terminated the expanded facility prior to its expiration in March 2010. Other In May 2010, we entered into a 3-year $ 1.0 billion Senior Unsecured Revolving Credit Facility. On May 20, 2011, we entered into a 4-year, $ 1.0 billion revolving credit facility through our wholly-owned subsidiary, IR-Global. This new facility replaced our pre-existing $ 1.0 billion , 3-year revolving credit facility that was scheduled to mature in June 2011 . At December 31, 2011 , our total committed revolving credit facilities was $ 2.0 billion , of which $ 1.0 billion expires in May 2013 and $ 1.0 billion expires in May 2015 . Each of IR-Ireland, IR-Limited and IR-International has provided an irrevocable and unconditional guarantee for these credit facilities. These lines are unused and provide support for our commercial paper program as well as for other general corporate purposes. Pension Plans Our investment objective in managing defined benefit plan assets is to ensure that all present and future benefit obligations are met as they come due. We seek to achieve this goal while trying to mitigate volatility in plan funded status, contribution and expense by better matching the characteristics of the plan assets to that of the plan liabilities. Prior to 2011, we utilized asset/liability modeling studies as the basis for global asset allocation decisions. In 2011, we adopted a dynamic approach to asset allocation whereby a plan's allocation to fixed income assets increases progressively over time towards an ultimate target of 90% as a plan moves toward full funding. We monitor plan funded status and asset allocation regularly in addition to investment manager performance. We monitor the impact of market conditions on our defined benefit plans on a regular basis. During 2011, none of our defined benefit pension plans have experienced a significant impact on their liquidity due to the volatility in the markets. For further details on pension plan activity, see Note 10 to the Consolidated Financial Statements. Cash Flows The following table reflects the major categories of cash flows for the years ended December 31, respectively. For additional details, please see the Consolidated Statements of Cash Flows in the Consolidated Financial Statements. In millions 2011 2010 2009 Operating cash flow provided by (used in) continuing operations $ 1,230.2 $ 756.4 $ 1,756.9 Investing cash flow provided by (used in) continuing operations 163.1 (179.0 ) (183.1 ) Financing cash flow provided by (used in) continuing operations (1,246.4 ) (403.7 ) (1,208.1 ) Operating Activities Net cash provided by operating activities from continuing operations was $ 1,230.2 million for the year ended December 31, 2011 compared with $ 756.4 million in 2010 . Operating cash flows for 2011 reflect improved earnings from continuing operations after consideration of the non-cash loss on sale/asset impairment charge related to the Hussmann divestiture. Operating cash flows for 2010 reflect discretionary cash contributions to our pension funds of $444 million ($359 million after tax benefit received). Net cash provided by operating activities from continuing operations was $ 756.4 million for the year ended December 31, 2010 compared with $ 1,756.9 million in 2009 . As a result of the severe economic downturn, positive operating cash flows for 2009 reflected decreased volume levels and our increased focus on working capital management, including improvements in accounts 35 Table of Contents receivable collections and inventory management. While we continued to actively manage working capital in 2010, our operating cash flows reflected increased accounts receivable and inventory levels from 2009 as several of our end markets stabilized and we anticipated improvement in several of our key end markets during 2011. Additionally, during 2010 we made discretionary cash contributions to our pension funds of $444 million ($359 million after tax benefit received). Investing Activities Net cash provided by investing activities from continuing operations was $ 163.1 million for the year ended December 31, 2011 compared with net cash used in investing activities from continuing operations of $ 179.0 million in 2010 . The change in investing activities is primarily attributable to net proceeds from the sale of the discontinued operations $356 million, as well as proceeds from the sale of assets from a restructured business in China. These proceeds were partially offset by an increase in capital expenditures during 2011. Net cash used in investing activities from continuing operations was $ 179.0 million for the year ended December 31, 2010 compared with $ 183.1 million in 2009 . The change in investing activities is primarily attributable to a reduction in capital expenditures during 2010. Financing Activities Net cash used in financing activities from continuing operations during the year ended December 31, 2011 was $ 1,246.4 million , compared with $ 403.7 million during 2010 . The change in financing activities is primarily related to approximately $ 1.2 billion of share repurchases as well as increased dividend payments, partially offset by lower repayments of long term debt in 2011. Net cash used in financing activities from continuing operations during the year ended December 31, 2010 was $ 403.7 million , compared with $ 1,208.1 million during 2009 . The change in financing activities is primarily related to less debt repayments in 2010, additional stock options exercised and a reduction of the quarterly stock dividend. Capital Resources Based on historical performance and current expectations, we believe our cash and cash equivalents balance, the cash generated from our operations, our committed credit lines and our expected ability to access capital markets will satisfy our working capital needs, capital expenditures and other liquidity requirements associated with our operations for the foreseeable future. Capital expenditures were $ 242.9 million , $ 179.5 million and $ 204.1 million for 2011 , 2010 and 2009 , respectively. Our investments continue to improve manufacturing productivity, reduce costs and provide environmental enhancements and advanced technologies for existing facilities. The capital expenditure program for 2012 is estimated to be approximately $250 million, including amounts approved in prior periods. Many of these projects are subject to review and cancellation at our option without incurring substantial charges. For financial market risk impacting the Company, see Item 7A. Quantitative and Qualitative Disclosure About Market Risk. Capitalization In addition to cash on hand and operating cash flow, we maintain significant credit availability under our Commercial Paper Program. Our ability to borrow at a cost-effective rate under the Commercial Paper Program is contingent upon maintaining an investment-grade credit rating. As of December 31, 2011 , our credit ratings were as follows: Short-term Long-term Moody P-2 Baa1 Standard and Poor A-2 BBB+ The credit ratings set forth above are not a recommendation to buy, sell or hold securities and may be subject to revision or withdrawal by the assigning rating organization. Each rating should be evaluated independently of any other rating. In May 2010, we entered into a 3-year $ 1.0 billion Senior Unsecured Revolving Credit Facility. On May 20, 2011, we entered into a 4-year, $ 1.0 billion revolving credit facility through our wholly-owned subsidiary, IR-Global. This new facility replaced our pre-existing $ 1.0 billion , 3-year revolving credit facility that was scheduled to mature in June 2011 . At December 31, 2011 , our total committed revolving credit facilities was $ 2.0 billion , of which $ 1.0 billion expires in May 2013 and $ 1.0 billion expires in May 2015 . Each of IR-Ireland, IR-Limited and IR-International has provided an irrevocable and unconditional guarantee for these credit facilities. These lines are unused and provide support for our commercial paper program as well as for other general corporate purposes. 36 Table of Contents In addition, other available non-U.S. lines of credit were $ 617.2 million , of which $ 447.9 million was unused at December 31, 2011 . These lines provide support for bank guarantees, letters of credit and other general corporate purposes. Our public debt does not contain financial covenants and our revolving credit lines have a debt-to-total capital covenant of 65%. As of December 31, 2011 , our debt-to-total capital ratio was significantly beneath this limit. Guarantees Subsequent to the Ireland Reorganization, IR-Ireland and IR-Limited guarantee fully and unconditionally the outstanding public debt of IR-International, IR-Global and IR-New Jersey. Neither IR-Ireland nor IR-Limited has issued or intends to issue guarantees in respect of any public indebtedness incurred by Trane. Contractual Obligations The following table summarizes our contractual cash obligations by required payment periods, in millions: Less than 1 year 1 - 3 years 3 - 5 years More than 5 years Total Short-term debt $ 66.0 $ $ $ $ 66.0 Long-term debt 700.6 * 1,270.2 517.7 1,092.8 3,581.3 Interest payments on long-term debt 231.3 363.4 209.6 1,067.5 1,871.8 Purchase obligations 901.3 1.9 903.2 Operating leases 123.5 181.5 99.1 64.9 469.0 Total contractual cash obligations $ 2,022.7 $ 1,817.0 $ 826.4 $ 2,225.2 $ 6,891.3 * Includes $343.6 million of debt redeemable at the option of the holder. The scheduled maturities of these bonds range between 2027 and 2028. Also includes $345 million related to the Exchangeable Senior Notes due in 2012. See Note 8 to the Consolidated Financial Statements for additional information. Future expected obligations under our pension and postretirement benefit plans, income taxes, environmental and asbestos-related matters have not been included in the contractual cash obligations table above. Pensions At December 31, 2011 , we had net obligations of $ 740.7 million , which consist of noncurrent pension assets of $ 4.7 million and current and non-current pension benefit liabilities of $ 745.4 million . It is our objective to contribute to the pension plans to ensure adequate funds are available in the plans to make benefit payments to plan participants and beneficiaries when required. We currently project that we will contribute approximately $ 98.3 million to our plans worldwide in 2012 . Because the timing and amounts of long-term funding requirements for pension obligations are uncertain, they have been excluded from the preceding table. See Note 10 to the Consolidated Financial Statements for additional information. Postretirement Benefits Other than Pensions At December 31, 2011 , we had postretirement benefit obligations of $ 919.9 million . We fund postretirement benefit costs principally on a pay-as-you-go basis as medical costs are incurred by covered retiree populations. Benefit payments, which are net of expected plan participant contributions and Medicare Part D subsidy, are expected to be approximately $ 73.2 million in 2012 . Because the timing and amounts of long-term funding requirements for postretirement obligations are uncertain, they have been excluded from the preceding table. See Note 10 to the Consolidated Financial Statements for additional information. Income Taxes At December 31, 2011 , we have total unrecognized tax benefits for uncertain tax positions of $ 536.9 million and $ 108.3 million of related accrued interest and penalties, net of tax. The liability has been excluded from the preceding table as we are unable to reasonably estimate the amount and period in which these liabilities might be paid. See Note 16 to the Consolidated Financial Statements for additional information regarding matters relating to income taxes, including unrecognized tax benefits and Internal Revenue Service (IRS) tax disputes. Environmental and Asbestos Matters We are involved in various litigations, claims and administrative proceedings, including those related to environmental, asbestos-related, and product liability matters. We believe that these liabilities are subject to the uncertainties inherent in estimating future costs for contingent liabilities, and will likely be resolved over an extended period of time. Because the timing and amounts of potential future cash flows are uncertain, they have been excluded from the preceding table. See Note 19 to the Consolidated Financial Statements for additional information. See Note 8 and Note 19 to the Consolidated Financial Statements for additional information on matters affecting our liquidity. 37 Table of Contents Critical Accounting Policies Management Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations are based upon our Consolidated Financial Statements, which have been prepared in accordance with accounting principles generally accepted in the United States (GAAP). The preparation of financial statements in conformity with those accounting principles requires management to use judgment in making estimates and assumptions based on the relevant information available at the end of each period. These estimates and assumptions have a significant effect on reported amounts of assets and liabilities, revenue and expenses as well as the disclosure of contingent assets and liabilities because they result primarily from the need to make estimates and assumptions on matters that are inherently uncertain. Actual results may differ from estimates. The following is a summary of certain accounting estimates and assumptions made by management that we consider critical. Allowance for doubtful accounts We have provided an allowance for doubtful accounts receivable which represents our best estimate of probable loss inherent in our accounts receivable portfolio. This estimate is based upon our policy, derived from our knowledge of our end markets, customer base and products. Goodwill and indefinite-lived intangible assets We have significant goodwill and indefinite-lived intangible assets on our balance sheet related to acquisitions. Our goodwill and other indefinite-lived intangible assets are tested and reviewed annually during the fourth quarter for impairment or when there is a significant change in events or circumstances that indicate that the fair value of an asset is more likely than not less than the carrying amount of the asset. Recoverability of goodwill is measured at the reporting unit level and determined using a two step process. The first step compares the carrying amount of the reporting unit to its estimated fair value. If the estimated fair value of a reporting unit exceeds its carrying amount, goodwill of the reporting unit is not impaired and the second step of the impairment test is not necessary. To the extent that the carrying value of the reporting unit exceeds its estimated fair value, a second step is performed, wherein the reporting unit carrying value of goodwill is compared to the implied fair value of goodwill. To the extent that the carrying value exceeds the implied fair value, impairment exists and must be recognized. As quoted market prices are not available for our reporting units, the calculation of their estimated fair value in step one is based on two valuation techniques, a discounted cash flow model (income approach) and a market adjusted multiple of earnings and revenues (market approach), with each method being equally weighted in the calculation. In step 2, the implied fair value of goodwill is determined in the same manner as the amount of goodwill recognized in a business combination. The estimated fair value of the reporting unit is allocated to all of the assets and liabilities of the reporting unit (including any unrecognized intangible assets) as if the reporting unit had been acquired in a business combination and the fair value of the reporting unit, as determined in the first step of the goodwill impairment test, was the price paid to acquire that reporting unit. Recoverability of other intangible assets with indefinite useful lives is measured by a comparison of the carrying amount of the intangible assets to the estimated fair value of the respective intangible assets. Any excess of the carrying value over the estimated fair value is recognized as an impairment loss equal to that excess. The calculation of estimated fair value is determined on a relief from royalty methodology (income approach) which is based on the implied royalty paid, at an appropriate discount rate, to license the use of an asset rather than owning the asset. The present value of the after-tax cost savings (i.e. royalty relief) indicates the estimated fair value of the asset. The determination of the estimated fair value and the implied fair value of goodwill and other indefinite-lived intangible assets requires us to make assumptions about estimated cash flows, including profit margins, long-term forecasts, discount rates and terminal growth rates. We developed these assumptions based on the market and geographic risks unique to each reporting unit. 2011 Impairment Test As a result of the planned divestiture of Hussmann, we were required to test Goodwill within the Climate Solutions segment for impairment in the first quarter of 2011, and no impairment charge was required. Based on year to date operational results, and management turnover within the Residential HVAC reporting unit, we updated our fair value assessment of the reporting unit in the third quarter of 2011 and noted that the fair value of the reporting unit continued to exceed its carrying amount. For our annual impairment testing performed during the fourth quarter of 2011, we determined that the fair value of the reporting units and indefinite-lived intangible assets exceeded their respective carrying values. The estimates of fair value are based on the best information available as of the date of the assessment, which primarily incorporates management assumptions about expected future cash flows. 38 Table of Contents Goodwill - Under the income approach, we assumed a forecasted cash flow period of five years with discount rates ranging from 12.0% to 17.0% and terminal growth rates ranging from 2.5% to 4.0% . Under the market approach, we used an adjusted multiple of earnings and revenues based on the market information of comparable companies. Additionally, we compared the estimated aggregate fair value of our reporting units to our overall market capitalization. For all reporting units except two, the excess of the estimated fair value over carrying value (expressed as a percentage of carrying value) was a minimum of 15% . The two reporting units with a percentage of carrying value less than 15%, reported within the Residential Solutions and Security Technologies segments, exceeded their carrying value by 5.8% and 10.9% , respectively. These reporting units have goodwill of approximately $ 599 million and $ 198 million , respectively. A significant increase in the discount rate, decrease in the long-term growth rate, or substantial reductions in our end markets and volume assumptions could have a negative impact on the estimated fair value of these reporting units. Other Indefinite-lived intangible assets - In testing our other indefinite-lived intangible assets for impairment, we assumed forecasted revenues for a period of five years with discount rates ranging from 12.5% to 14.5%, terminal growth rates ranging from 2.5% to 3.0%, and royalty rates ranging from 3.0% to 5.0%. The fair values of two of our tradenames exceeded their respective carrying amounts by less than 15%. The two tradenames, reported within the Climate Solutions and Residential Solutions segments, exceeded their carrying value by 7.3% and 11.6%. The carrying values of these tradenames are approximately $2,497 million and $105 million. A significant increase in the discount rate, decrease in the long-term growth rate, decrease in the royalty rate or substantial reductions in our end markets and volume assumptions could have a negative impact on their estimated fair values. 2010 Impairment Test For our annual impairment testing performed during the fourth quarter of 2010, we determined that the fair value of the reporting units and indefinite-lived intangible assets exceeded their respective carrying values. The estimates of fair value are based on the best information available as of the date of the assessment, which primarily incorporates management assumptions about expected future cash flows. Goodwill - Under the income approach, we assumed a forecasted cash flow period of five years with discount rates generally ranging from 11.5% to 18% and terminal growth rates generally ranging from 2.5% to 4% . Under the market approach, we used an adjusted multiple of earnings and revenues based on the market information of comparable companies. Additionally, we compared the estimated aggregate fair value of our reporting units to our overall market capitalization. For all reporting units except three, the excess of the estimated fair value over carrying value (expressed as a percentage of carrying value) was a minimum of 15% . The three reporting units with a percentage of carrying value less than 15%, reported within the Climate Solutions segment, exceeded their carrying value by 4.4% , 9.4% , and 10.8% . These reporting units have goodwill of approximately $ 243 million , $ 1,075 million , and $ 561 million , respectively. A significant increase in the discount rate, decrease in the long-term growth rate, or substantial reductions in our end markets and volume assumptions could have a negative impact on the estimated fair value of these reporting units. Other Indefinite-lived intangible assets - In testing our other indefinite-lived intangible assets for impairment, we assumed forecasted revenues for a period of five years with discount rates ranging from 12.0% to 14.0%, terminal growth rates ranging from 2.5% to 3.0%, and royalty rates ranging from 2.0% to 5.0%. The fair values of two of our tradenames exceeded their respective carrying amounts by less than 15%. The two tradenames, reported within the Climate Solutions, Residential Solutions and Security Technologies segments, exceeded their carrying value by 6.9% and 5.6%, respectively. The carrying values of these tradenames are approximately $2,497 million and $9 million. A significant increase in the discount rate, decrease in the long-term growth rate, decrease in the royalty rate or substantial reductions in our end markets and volume assumptions could have a negative impact on their estimated fair values. Long-lived assets and finite-lived intangibles Long-lived assets and finite-lived intangibles are reviewed for impairment whenever events or changes in business circumstances indicate that the carrying amount of an asset may not be fully recoverable. Assets are grouped with other assets and liabilities at the lowest level for which identifiable cash flows can be generated. Impairment in the carrying value of an asset would be recognized whenever anticipated future undiscounted cash flows from an asset are less than its carrying value. The impairment is measured as the amount by which the carrying value exceeds the fair value of the asset as determined by an estimate of discounted cash flows. We believe that our use of estimates and assumptions are reasonable and comply with generally accepted accounting principles. Changes in business conditions could potentially require future adjustments to these valuations. Loss contingencies Liabilities are recorded for various contingencies arising in the normal course of business, including litigation and administrative proceedings, environmental and asbestos matters and product liability, product warranty, worker compensation and other claims. We have recorded reserves in the financial statements related to these matters, which are developed using input derived from actuarial estimates and historical and anticipated experience data depending 39 Table of Contents on the nature of the reserve, and in certain instances with consultation of legal counsel, internal and external consultants and engineers. Subject to the uncertainties inherent in estimating future costs for these types of liabilities, we believe our estimated reserves are reasonable and do not believe the final determination of the liabilities with respect to these matters would have a material effect on our financial condition, results of operations, liquidity or cash flows for any year. Asbestos matters Certain of our wholly-owned subsidiaries are named as defendants in asbestos-related lawsuits in state and federal courts. We record a liability for our actual and anticipated future claims as well as an asset for anticipated insurance settlements. Although we were neither a manufacturer nor producer of asbestos, some of our formerly manufactured components from third party suppliers utilized asbestos-related components. As a result, we record certain income and expenses associated with our asbestos liabilities and corresponding insurance recoveries within discontinued operations, net of tax, as they relate to previously divested businesses. Income and expenses associated with Trane asbestos liabilities and corresponding insurance recoveries are recorded within continuing operations. Refer to Note 19 to the Consolidated Financial Statements for further details of asbestos-related matters. Revenue recognition Revenue is recognized and earned when all of the following criteria are satisfied: (a) persuasive evidence of a sales arrangement exists; (b) price is fixed or determinable; (c) collectability is reasonably assured; and (d) delivery has occurred or service has been rendered. Delivery generally occurs when the title and the risks and rewards of ownership have substantially transferred to the customer. Revenue from maintenance contracts or extended warranties is recognized on a straight-line basis over the life of the contract, unless another method is more representative of the costs incurred. We enter into agreements that contain multiple elements, such as equipment, installation and service revenue. For multiple-element arrangements, the revenue relating to undelivered elements is deferred until delivery of the deferred elements. We recognize revenue for delivered elements when the delivered item has stand-alone value to the customer, customer acceptance has occurred, and there are only customary refund or return rights related to the delivered elements. Revenues from certain of our equipment and the related installation sold under construction-type contracts are recorded using the percentage-of-completion method in accordance with GAAP. Income taxes Deferred tax assets and liabilities are determined based on temporary differences between financial reporting and tax bases of assets and liabilities, applying enacted tax rates expected to be in effect for the year in which the differences are expected to reverse. We recognize future tax benefits, such as net operating losses and non-U.S. tax credits, to the extent that realizing these benefits is considered in our judgment to be more likely than not. We regularly review the recoverability of our deferred tax assets considering our historic profitability, projected future taxable income, timing of the reversals of existing temporary differences and the feasibility of our tax planning strategies. Where appropriate, we record a valuation allowance with respect to a future tax benefit. The provision for income taxes involves a significant amount of management judgment regarding interpretation of relevant facts and laws in the jurisdictions in which we operate. Future changes in applicable laws, projected levels of taxable income, and tax planning could change the effective tax rate and tax balances recorded by us. In addition, tax authorities periodically review income tax returns filed by us and can raise issues regarding our filing positions, timing and amount of income or deductions, and the allocation of income among the jurisdictions in which we operate. A significant period of time may elapse between the filing of an income tax return and the ultimate resolution of an issue raised by a revenue authority with respect to that return. We believe that we have adequately provided for any reasonably foreseeable resolution of these matters. We will adjust our estimate if significant events so dictate. To the extent that the ultimate results differ from our original or adjusted estimates, the effect will be recorded in the provision for income taxes in the period that the matter is finally resolved. Employee benefit plans We provide a range of benefits to eligible employees and retired employees, including pensions, postretirement and postemployment benefits. Determining the cost associated with such benefits is dependent on various actuarial assumptions including discount rates, expected return on plan assets, compensation increases, employee mortality, turnover rates and healthcare cost trend rates. Actuarial valuations are performed to determine expense in accordance with GAAP. Actual results may differ from the actuarial assumptions and are generally accumulated and amortized into earnings over future periods. We review our actuarial assumptions at each measurement date and make modifications to the assumptions based on current rates and trends, if appropriate. The discount rate, the rate of compensation increase and the expected long-term rates of return on plan assets are determined as of each measurement date. A discount rate reflects a rate at which pension benefits could be effectively settled. Discount rates for all plans are established using hypothetical yield curves based on the yields of corporate bonds rated AA quality. Spot rates are developed from the yield curve and used to discount future benefit payments. Prior to 2010, for non-U.S. plans the discount rates were based upon a review of the current yields reported on AA corporate bonds or the yields of high-quality fixed-income investments available and expected to be available during the life of the plans. The rate of compensation increase is dependent on expected future compensation levels. The expected long-term rate of return on plan assets reflects the average rate of returns expected on the funds invested or to be invested to provide for the benefits included in the projected benefit obligation. The expected long-term rate of return on plan assets is based on what is achievable given the plan investment policy, the types of assets 40 Table of Contents held and the target asset allocation. The expected long-term rate of return is determined as of each measurement date. We believe that the assumptions utilized in recording our obligations under our plans are reasonable based on input from our actuaries, outside investment advisors and information as to assumptions used by plan sponsors. Changes in any of the assumptions can have an impact on the net periodic pension cost or postretirement benefit cost. Estimated sensitivities to the expected 2012 net periodic pension cost of a 0.25% rate decline in the two basic assumptions are as follows: the decline in the discount rate would increase expense by approximately $10.5 million and the decline in the estimated return on assets would increase expense by approximately $7.6 million. A 0.25% rate decrease in the discount rate for postretirement benefits would increase expected 2012 net periodic postretirement benefit cost by $0.9 million and a 1.0% increase in the healthcare cost trend rate would increase the cost by approximately $1.8 million. The preparation of financial statements includes the use of estimates and assumptions that affect a number of amounts included in our Consolidated Financial Statements. If actual amounts are ultimately different from previous estimates, the revisions are included in our results for the period in which the actual amounts become known. Historically, the aggregate differences, if any, between our estimates and actual amounts in any year have not had a material impact on the Consolidated Financial Statements. Recently Adopted Accounting Pronouncements: In October 2009, the Financial Accounting Standards Board (FASB) issued Accounting Standards Update (ASU) 2009-13, "Revenue Recognition (Topic 605): Multiple-Deliverable Revenue Arrangements, a consensus of the FASB Emerging Issues Task Force," which revised guidance within FASB Accounting Standards Codification (ASC) 605, "Revenue Recognition." These revisions include additional disclosures regarding multiple-deliverable revenue arrangements, such as any significant assumptions made and the effects of the relative selling price method on revenue recognition. The new disclosure requirements were effective for the Company as of January 1, 2011. The provisions of ASU 2009-13 did not have a material impact on our Consolidated Financial Statements and Notes. In September 2011, the FASB issued ASU 2011-09, Compensation - Retirement Benefits - Multiemployer Plans (Subtopic 715-80). The revised guidance expands the required disclosures of employers on multiemployer pension plan participation, obligations, and funded status. The revised disclosure requirements are reflected in Note 10. Recently Issued Accounting Pronouncements: In May 2011, the FASB issued ASU 2011-04, Fair Value Measurement (Topic 820): Amendments to Achieve Common Fair Value Measurement and Disclosure Requirements in U.S. GAAP and International Financial Reporting Standards (IFRS)." ASU 2011-04 represents converged guidance between GAAP and IFRS resulting in common requirements for measuring fair value and for disclosing information about fair value measurements. This new guidance will be effective for fiscal years beginning after December 15, 2011 and subsequent interim periods. We are currently assessing the impact on our Consolidated Financial Statements. In June 2011, the FASB issued ASU 2011-05, Presentation of Comprehensive Income." ASU 2011-05 requires us to present components of other comprehensive income and of net income in one continuous statement of comprehensive income, or in two separate, but consecutive statements. The option to report other comprehensive income within the statement of equity has been removed. This new presentation of comprehensive income will be effective for fiscal years beginning after December 15, 2011 and subsequent interim periods. In September 2011, the FASB issued ASU 2011-08, Testing Goodwill for Impairment. This revised standard provides entities with the option to first use an assessment of qualitative factors to determine whether the existence of events or circumstances leads to a determination that it is more likely than not that the fair value of a reporting unit is less than its carrying amount. If a conclusion is reached that reporting unit fair value is not more likely than not below carrying value, no further impairment testing is necessary. This revised guidance applies to fiscal years beginning after December 15, 2011, and the related interim and annual goodwill impairment tests. We do not believe it will have a material impact on our Consolidated Financial Statements.
