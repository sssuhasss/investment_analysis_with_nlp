Executive Overview We are a leading global pharmaceutical company and have developed, manufactured, marketed, licensed and distributed high quality generic, branded and branded generic pharmaceutical products for more than 45 years. As a result of our acquisition of the former Merck Generics business in October 2007 and the acquisition of a controlling interest in Matrix in January 2007, we are a leader in branded specialty pharmaceuticals and the third largest active pharmaceutical ingredient ( API ) manufacturer with respect to the number of drug master files ( DMFs ) filed with regulatory agencies. We hold a leading generics sales position in four of the world largest pharmaceutical markets, those being the United States ( U.S. ), the United Kingdom ( U.K. ), France and Japan, and we also hold leading sales positions in several other key generics markets, including Australia, Belgium, Italy, Portugal and Spain. Mylan has three reportable segments: the Generics Segment , the Specialty Segment , and the Matrix Segment , as determined in accordance with Statement of Financial Accounting Standards ( SFAS ) No. 131, Disclosures about Segments of an Enterprise and Related Information . Certain general and administrative expenses, as well as litigation settlements, revenue related to the sale of Bystolic rights, amortization of intangible assets and certain purchase accounting items (such as the write-off of in-process research and development and the amortization of the inventory step-up), non-cash impairment charges, and other expenses not directly attributable to the segments are reported in Corporate/Other. The measure of profitability used by the Company with respect to segments is gross profit less direct research and development expenses ( R&D ) and direct selling, general and administrative expenses ( SG&A ). 48 Table of Contents Change in Fiscal Year Effective October 2, 2007, we changed our fiscal year end from March 31st to December 31st. We have defined various periods that are covered in the discussion below as follows: calendar year 2008 January 1, 2008 through December 31, 2008; calendar year 2007 or comparable twelve-month period January 1, 2007 through December 31, 2007; transition period April 1, 2007 through December 31, 2007; comparable nine-month period April 1, 2006 through December 31, 2006; and fiscal 2007 April 1, 2006 through March 31, 2007. The above periods include Matrix from January 8, 2007 and the former Merck Generics business from October 2, 2007. As a result of the change in year end, the Company believes that a comparison between calendar year 2008 and calendar year 2007 and a comparison between the transition period and the comparable nine-month period enhances a reader understanding of the Company results of operations and, as such, these are the comparisons which are presented below in the section titled Results of Operations . The financial and operational trends highlighted in the comparisons presented below are consistent with those that would result from a comparison of calendar year 2008 to the transition period and from a comparison of the transition period to fiscal 2007, respectively. An overview of fiscal 2007 is also provided below in order to highlight certain trends and the effects on that year of the Matrix transaction which are not in the comparable nine-month period. Bystolic In January 2006, the Company announced an agreement with Forest Laboratories Holdings, Ltd. ( Forest ), a wholly-owned subsidiary of Forest Laboratories, Inc., for the commercialization, development and distribution of Bystolic in the United States and Canada (the 2006 Agreement ). Under the terms of that agreement, Mylan received a $75.0 million up-front payment and $25.0 million upon approval of the product. Such amounts were being deferred until the commercial launch of the product and were to be amortized over the remaining term of the license agreement. Mylan also had the potential to earn future milestones and royalties on Bystolic sales and an option to co-promote the product, while Forest assumed all future development and selling and marketing expenses. In February 2008, Mylan executed an agreement with Forest whereby Mylan sold to Forest its rights to Bystolic (the Amended Agreement ). Under the terms of the Amended Agreement, Mylan received a one-time cash payment of $370.0 million, which was deferred along with the $100.0 million received under the 2006 Agreement, and retained its contractual royalties for three years, through 2010. Mylan obligations under the 2006 Agreement to supply Bystolic to Forest were unchanged by the Amended Agreement. Mylan believed that these supply obligations represented significant continuing involvement as Mylan remained contractually obligated to manufacture the product for Forest while the product was being commercialized. As a result of this continuing involvement, Mylan had been amortizing the $470.0 million of deferred revenue ratably through 2020 pending the transfer of manufacturing responsibility that was anticipated to occur in the second half of 2008. In September 2008, Mylan completed the transfer of all manufacturing responsibilities for the product to Forest, and Mylan supply obligations have therefore been eliminated. The Company believes that it no longer has significant continuing involvement and that the earnings process has been completed. As such, the deferred revenue of $468.1 million was recognized and included in other revenues in the Company Consolidated Statements of Operations during calendar year 2008. Future royalties are considered to be contingent consideration and are recognized in other revenue as earned upon sales of the product by Forest. Such royalties are recorded at the net royalty rates specified in the Amended Agreement. 49 Table of Contents Issuance of Cash Convertible Notes On September 15, 2008, Mylan completed the sale of $575.0 million of 3.75% Cash Convertible Notes due 2015 ( Cash Convertible Notes ). The Cash Convertible Notes were sold in a private placement to qualified institutional buyers pursuant to Rule 144A under the Securities Act of 1933, as amended (the Securities Act ). The Cash Convertible Notes, which are unsecured, pay interest semi-annually at a rate of 3.75% per annum and mature on September 15, 2015. The Cash Convertible Notes are convertible under certain circumstances into cash at an initial conversion reference rate of 75.0751 shares of Mylan common stock per $1,000 principal amount of notes (which is equal to an initial conversion reference price of approximately $13.32 per share). The Cash Convertible Notes are not convertible into shares of Mylan common stock or any other securities. Goodwill Impairment On February 27, 2008, the Company announced that it was reviewing strategic alternatives for its specialty business, Dey, including the potential sale of the business. This decision was based upon several factors, including a strategic review of the business, the expected performance of the Perforomist product, where anticipated growth was determined to be slower than expected and the timeframe to reach peak sales was determined to be longer than was originally anticipated. As a result of our ongoing review of strategic alternatives, we determined that it was more likely than not that the business would be sold or otherwise disposed of significantly before the end of its previously estimated useful life. Accordingly, a recoverability test of Dey long-lived assets was performed during the three months ended March 31, 2008 in accordance with SFAS No. 144, Accounting for the Impairment or Disposal of Long-Lived Assets ( SFAS No. 144 ). We included both cash flow projections and estimated proceeds from the eventual disposition of the long-lived assets. The estimated undiscounted future cash flows exceeded the book values of the long-lived assets and, as a result, no impairment charge was recorded. Upon the closing of the former Merck Generics business acquisition, Dey was defined as the Specialty Segment under the provisions of SFAS No. 131. Dey is also considered a reporting unit under the provisions of SFAS No. 142, Goodwill and Other Intangible Assets ( SFAS No. 142 ). Upon closing of the transaction, the Company allocated $711.2 million of goodwill to Dey. The Company tests goodwill for possible impairment on an annual basis and at any other time events occur or circumstances indicate that the carrying amount of goodwill may be impaired. As we had determined that it was more likely than not that the business would be sold or otherwise disposed of significantly before the end of its previously estimated useful life, the Company was required, during the three months ended March 31, 2008, to assess whether any portion of its recorded goodwill balance was impaired. The first step of the SFAS No. 142 impairment analysis consisted of a comparison of the fair value of the reporting unit with its carrying amount, including the goodwill. We performed extensive valuation analyses, utilizing both income and market-based approaches, in our goodwill assessment process. The following describes the valuation methodologies used to derive the estimated fair value of the reporting unit. Income Approach: To determine fair value, we discounted the expected future cash flows of the reporting unit. We used a discount rate, which reflected the overall level of inherent risk and the rate of return an outside investor would have expected to earn. To estimate cash flows beyond the final year of our model, we used a terminal value approach. Under this approach, we used estimated operating income before interest, taxes, depreciation and amortization in the final year of our model, adjusted to estimate a normalized cash flow, applied a perpetuity growth assumption, and discounted by a perpetuity discount factor to determine the terminal value. We incorporated the present value of the resulting terminal value into our estimate of fair value. Market-Based Approach: To corroborate the results of the income approach described above, we estimated the fair value of our reporting unit using several market-based approaches, including the guideline company method which focused on comparing our risk profile and growth prospects to a select group of publicly traded companies with reasonably similar guidelines. 50 Table of Contents Based on the SFAS No. 142 step one analysis that was performed for Dey, the Company determined that the carrying amount of the net assets of the reporting unit was in excess of its estimated fair value. As such, the Company was required to perform the step two analysis for Dey, in order to determine the amount of any goodwill impairment. The step two analysis consisted of comparing the implied fair value of the goodwill with the carrying amount of the goodwill, with an impairment charge resulting from any excess of the carrying value of the goodwill over the implied fair value of the goodwill based on a hypothetical allocation of the estimated fair value to the net assets. Based on the second step analysis, the Company concluded that $385.0 million of the goodwill recorded at Dey was impaired. As a result, the Company recorded a non-cash goodwill impairment charge of $385.0 million during the three months ended March 31, 2008, which represented our best estimate as of March 31, 2008. The allocation discussed above was performed only for purposes of assessing goodwill for impairment; accordingly, we have not adjusted the net book value of the assets and liabilities on the Company Consolidated Balance Sheet, other than goodwill, as a result of this process. The determination of the fair value of the reporting unit required the Company to make significant estimates and assumptions that affect the reporting unit expected future cash flows. These estimates and assumptions primarily include, but are not limited to, the discount rate, terminal growth rates, operating income before depreciation and amortization, and capital expenditures forecasts. Due to the inherent uncertainty involved in making these estimates, actual results could differ from those estimates. In addition, changes in underlying assumptions would have a significant impact on either the fair value of the reporting unit or the goodwill impairment charge. The hypothetical allocation of the fair value of the reporting unit to individual assets and liabilities within the reporting unit also requires the Company to make significant estimates and assumptions. The hypothetical allocation requires several analyses to determine the estimate of the fair value of assets and liabilities of the reporting unit. In September 2008, following the completion of the comprehensive review of strategic alternatives for Dey, the Company announced its decision to retain the Dey business. This decision included a plan to realign the business, including positioning the Company to divest Dey current facilities over the next two years. As a result, the Company expects to incur severance and other exit costs. In addition, the comprehensive review resulted in a non-cash impairment of certain non-core, insignificant, third-party products. Levetiracetam Launch On November 4, 2008, the Company announced that its wholly-owned subsidiary, Mylan Pharmaceuticals Inc. ( MPI ), received final approval from the U.S. Food and Drug Administration ( FDA ) for its Abbreviated New Drug Application ( ANDA ) for levetiracetam tablets, 250 mg, 500 mg and 750 mg. Levetiracetam tablets are the generic version of UCB Pharma Keppra . Levetiracetam tablets had U.S. sales of approximately $1.0 billion for the 12 months ended September 30, 2008 for these three strengths, according to IMS. Pursuant to an agreement with UCB Societe Anonyme and UCB Pharma Inc. to settle pending litigation relating to levetiracetam tablets, Mylan began shipment of its product immediately upon approval. Additional generic competition entered the market in mid-January 2009. Other Product Opportunities On December 2, 2008, the Company announced that Mylan and MPI have entered into a settlement agreement with Novartis Pharmaceuticals Corp., Novartis Corp. and Novartis International AG related to letrozole tablets, the generic version of Novartis Femara . Under the agreement, Mylan is provided a patent license that will enable the Company to market letrozole tablets, 2.5 mg, prior to the expiration of U.S. Patent No. 4,978,672. Additional terms related to the settlement remain confidential, and the agreement is subject to review by the U.S. Department of Justice and the Federal Trade Commission. Letrozole tablets, which are used in the treatment of breast cancer, had U.S. sales of approximately $470.0 million for the 12 months ended September 30, 2008, according to IMS. Mylan was the first generic drug company to file a substantially complete ANDA containing a Paragraph IV certification for the product. 51 Table of Contents Financial Summary Mylan financial results for calendar year 2008 included total revenues of $5.14 billion. For the comparable twelve-month period, total revenues were $2.67 billion. This represents an increase of $2.47 billion in total revenues. Consolidated gross profit for the current year was $2.07 billion compared to $1.11 billion in the comparable twelve-month period, an increase of $960.9 million. In the current year, operating income of $297.9 million was realized compared to an operating loss of $996.1 million in the comparable twelve-month period. The net loss available to common shareholders for the current year was $320.3 million compared to $1.23 billion in the comparable twelve-month period. This translates into a loss per diluted share of $1.05 for calendar year 2008, compared to $4.91 in the comparable twelve-month period. Comparability of results between these two periods is affected by the following items: Calendar Year 2008: The recognition of $468.1 million (pre-tax) of deferred revenue related to Mylan sale of the product rights of Bystolic; $415.6 million (pre-tax), which consisted primarily of incremental amortization related to purchased intangible assets and the amortization of the inventory step-up associated with the acquisition of the former Merck Generics business; Non-cash impairment loss on the goodwill of the Specialty Segment of $385.0 million (pre-tax and after-tax); Non-cash impairment charges of $72.5 million (pre-tax) on certain other assets; A $139.0 million (pre-tax and after-tax) dividend on the 6.5% mandatory convertible preferred stock; and A full twelve months of results from the former Merck Generics business in calendar year 2008 as compared to three months in calendar year 2007. Calendar Year 2007: The write-off of acquired in-process research and development related to the acquisition of the former Merck Generics business in the amount of $1.27 billion (pre-tax and after-tax); The write-off of acquired in-process research and development related to the acquisition of Matrix of $147.0 (pre-tax and after-tax); Charges totaling $57.2 million (pre-tax) related to early repayment of certain debt and financing fees; Net gains of $85.0 million (pre-tax) on foreign currency exchange contracts, primarily a foreign currency option contract related to the purchase price for the former Merck Generics business acquisition; $170.8 million (pre-tax), which consisted primarily of incremental amortization expense related to purchased intangible assets and the amortization of the inventory step-up associated with the acquisitions of the former Merck Generics business and Matrix; and A $16.0 million (pre-tax and after-tax) dividend on the 6.5% mandatory convertible preferred stock. In addition to the above, the loss per common share for calendar year 2007 was impacted by the issuance of 26.2 million shares of common stock in March 2007 and the issuance of 55.4 million shares of common stock in November 2007. Because these offerings occurred during calendar year 2007, the loss per common share did not bear the full impact of these new shares. However, these shares were outstanding for the full calendar year 2008. A more detailed discussion of the Company financial results can be found below in the section titled Results of Operations . 52 Table of Contents Results of Operations Calendar Year December 31, Nine Months December 31, Fiscal Year 2008 2007 2007 2006 March 31, 2007 (Unaudited) (Unaudited) (In thousands, except per share amounts) Revenues: Net revenues $ 4,631,237 $ 2,646,643 $ 2,162,943 $ 1,103,247 $ 1,586,947 Other revenues 506,348 19,380 15,818 21,310 24,872 Total revenues 5,137,585 2,666,023 2,178,761 1,124,557 1,611,819 Cost of sales 3,067,364 1,556,728 1,304,313 515,736 768,151 Gross profit 2,070,221 1,109,295 874,448 608,821 843,668 Operating expenses: Research and development 317,217 182,911 146,063 66,844 103,692 Acquired in-process research and development 1,416,036 1,269,036 147,000 Goodwill impairment 385,000 Selling, general and administrative 1,053,485 512,352 449,598 152,784 215,538 Litigation settlements, net 16,634 (5,946 ) (1,984 ) (46,154 ) (50,116 ) Total operating expenses 1,772,336 2,105,353 1,862,713 173,474 416,114 Earnings (loss) from operations 297,885 (996,058 ) (988,265 ) 435,347 427,554 Interest expense 357,045 200,394 179,410 31,292 52,276 Other income, net 11,337 97,060 86,611 39,785 50,234 (Loss) earnings before income taxes and minority interest (47,823 ) (1,099,392 ) (1,081,064 ) 443,840 425,512 Income tax provision 137,423 112,823 60,073 155,267 208,017 (Loss) earnings before minority interest (185,246 ) (1,212,215 ) (1,141,137 ) 288,573 217,495 Minority interest (income) expense (4,031 ) (2,901 ) (3,112 ) 211 Net (loss) earnings before preferred dividends (181,215 ) (1,209,314 ) (1,138,025 ) 288,573 217,284 Preferred dividends 139,035 15,999 15,999 Net (loss) earnings available to common shareholders $ (320,250 ) $ (1,225,313 ) $ (1,154,024 ) $ 288,573 $ 217,284 (Loss) earnings per common share: Basic $ (1.05 ) $ (4.91 ) $ (4.49 ) $ 1.37 $ 1.01 Diluted $ (1.05 ) $ (4.91 ) $ (4.49 ) $ 1.34 $ 0.99 Weighted average common shares outstanding: Basic 304,360 249,652 257,150 211,075 215,096 Diluted 304,360 249,652 257,150 215,275 219,120 Calendar Year 2008 Compared to Calendar Year 2007 Total Revenues and Gross Profit For calendar year 2008, Mylan reported total revenues of $5.14 billion compared to $2.67 billion in the same prior year period. This represents an increase of $2.47 billion. In calendar year 2008, the former Merck Generics business contributed third-party revenues of $2.57 billion of which $2.19 billion are included in the Generics Segment and $386.0 million are included in the Specialty Segment. In calendar year 2007, for the three months following the date of acquisition, the former Merck Generics business contributed third-party revenues of $700.6 million of which $598.5 million are included in the Generics Segment and $102.1 million are included in the Specialty Segment. Also included in total revenues for the current year is $468.1 million of previously deferred revenue recognized related to the sale of our rights of Bystolic. Excluding revenue contributed by the former Merck Generics business for both years, and the Bystolic revenue in the current year, total sales for calendar 53 Table of Contents year 2008 were $2.10 billion compared to $1.97 billion. This represents an increase of approximately 6.7% or $131.0 million over the comparable twelve-month period, which includes approximately 1.0% of unfavorable foreign currency translation impact on Matrix revenues due to the strengthening of the U.S. Dollar. Matrix contributed third-party revenues of $376.0 million compared to $343.6 million in the comparable twelve-month period. In arriving at net revenues, gross revenues are reduced by provisions for estimates, including discounts, customer performance, indirect rebates and promotions, price adjustments, returns and chargebacks. See the section titled Application of Critical Accounting Policies in this Item 7, for a thorough discussion of our methodology with respect to such provisions. For calendar year ended December 31, 2008, the most significant amounts charged against gross revenues were for chargebacks in the amount of $1.46 billion and promotions and indirect rebates in the amount of $753.7 million. Gross profit for calendar year 2008 was $2.07 billion and gross margins were 40.3%. For calendar year 2007, gross profit was $1.11 billion and gross margins were 41.6%. Gross profit was impacted by certain purchase accounting related items recorded during calendar year 2008 of approximately $415.6 million, which consisted primarily of incremental amortization related to the purchased intangible assets and the amortization of the inventory step-up associated with the acquisition of the former Merck Generics business. In addition, gross profit is impacted by certain non-cash impairment charges of $65.7 million recorded during the calendar year ended December 31, 2008. Excluding these items, as well as the Bystolic revenue, gross margins would have been approximately 44.6%. Prior year gross profit is also impacted by similar purchase accounting related items recorded primarily with respect to the acquisition of the former Merck Generics business and the acquisition of Matrix in the amount of $170.8 million. Excluding such items, gross margins in the prior year would have been approximately 48.0%. The decrease in gross margins, excluding the items noted above, can generally be attributed to the fact that, on average, the newly acquired former Merck Generics business, particularly in countries outside of the United States, contributes margins that are lower than those realized by Mylan U.S. subsidiaries. The impact of these lower margins was realized for a full twelve months in calendar year 2008 compared to only three months in calendar year 2007. Additionally, gross margin is impacted by the timing of significant product launches. Products generally contribute most significantly to gross margin at the time of their launch and even more so in periods of market exclusivity or limited generic competition. For a period of time during calendar year 2007, Mylan had exclusivity on both amlodipine and oxybutynin. In the calendar year 2008, Mylan had exclusivity on levetiracetam upon its launch of the product on November 4, 2008. Generics Segment For calendar year 2008, the Generics Segment reported total revenues of $3.91 billion compared to $2.22 billion in calendar year 2007. Foreign currency translation had a negative impact on total revenues of approximately 2%, mainly due to the strengthening of the U.S. dollar in comparison to the Euro and Australian dollar. Total revenues from North America were $1.85 billion for calendar year 2008 compared to $1.68 billion for calendar year 2007, representing an increase of $176.6 million. Excluding revenue contributed from the acquisition of Merck Generics from both periods, total North America revenues increased by $99.8 million or 6.2%. This increase is the result of new product revenue and favorable volume, as doses shipped during the twelve months, excluding the impact of the acquisition, increased by 6.6% to 16.7 billion, partially offset by unfavorable pricing. Fentanyl, Mylan AB-rated generic alternative to Duragesic , continued to contribute significantly to the financial results despite the entrance into the market of additional generic competition. As expected, the additional competition had an unfavorable impact on fentanyl pricing, and the Company expects that additional competition in the future could further impact pricing and market share. However, this was offset by increased volumes of fentanyl which Mylan was able to supply to the market as certain competitors experienced recall and supply issues. Additional generic competition resulted in unfavorable pricing on several other significant products in the Company portfolio. As is the case in the generic industry, the entrance into the market of additional competition generally has a negative impact on the volume and pricing of the affected products. For one product in particular, amlodipine, Mylan had market exclusivity for a portion of calendar year 2007. As a result, amlodipine accounted for 54 Table of Contents approximately 7% of calendar year 2007 North American revenues (excluding the former Merck Generics business). Additional generic competition was especially heavy on amlodipine and, as a result, calendar year 2008 revenues were insignificant. In order to offset decreases in sales as a result of additional competition, generic pharmaceutical manufacturers must be able to successfully bring new products to market. Products launched in the U.S. during calendar year 2008 contributed revenues of $264.0 million, with paroxetine extended-release and levetiracetam accounting for the majority. Total revenues from EMEA were $1.52 billion for calendar year 2008 compared to $373.1 million for calendar year 2007, all of which were the result of the acquisition of the former Merck Generics business in both periods. Within EMEA, approximately 70% of net revenues are derived from the three largest markets: France, the U.K. and Germany. Total revenues from Asia Pacific were $537.4 million for calendar year 2008 compared to $170.9 million for calendar year 2007, all of which were the result of the acquisition of the former Merck Generics business in both periods. The majority of revenues from Asia Pacific are contributed by Alphapharm, Mylan Australian subsidiary, with the remainder comprised of sales in Japan and New Zealand. Certain markets in which the Company does business have recently undergone, some for the first time, or will soon undergo, government-imposed price reductions or similar pricing pressures on pharmaceutical products. This is true in France and Australia, though this issue is not limited to solely these markets. In addition, a number of markets in which we operate have implemented or may implement tender systems for generic pharmaceuticals in an effort to lower prices. Such measures are likely to have a negative impact on sales and gross profit in these markets. However, some pro-generic government initiatives in certain markets could help to offset some of this unfavorability by potentially increasing generic substitution. For calendar year 2008, segment profitability for the Generics Segment was $969.9 million compared to $782.1 million in calendar year 2007. Excluding the results of the Merck Generics business from both years segment profitability increased by $41.3 million. This increase is the result of higher revenues and gross profit, as discussed above, partially offset by increased R&D expense, as further explained below. Specialty Segment For calendar year 2008, the Specialty Segment reported total revenues of $417.2 million, of which $386.0 million represented sales to third-parties. For calendar year 2007, from the date of acquisition, the Specialty Segment reported total revenues of $105.5 million, of which $102.1 million represented sales to third-parties. The Specialty Segment consists of Dey, an entity acquired as part of the former Merck Generics business that focuses on the development, manufacturing and marketing of specialty pharmaceuticals in the respiratory and severe allergy markets. The most significant contributor to the Specialty Segment revenues and profitability is EpiPen , an epinephrine auto-injector, which is used in the treatment of severe allergies. EpiPen is the number one prescribed treatment for severe allergic reactions with a U.S. market share of over 95%. Segment profitability for the Specialty Segment for calendar year 2008 was $36.6 million compared to $18.9 million in calendar year 2007. Matrix Segment For calendar year 2008, the Matrix Segment reported total revenues of $444.8 million, of which $376.0 million represented third-party sales, compared to total revenues of $389.6 million for calendar year 2007, of which $343.6 million represented third-party sales. Approximately 50% of the Matrix Segment third-party net revenues comes from the sale of API and intermediates and approximately 20% comes from the distribution of branded generic products in Europe. The majority of the remainder comes from the sale of Matrix finished dosage form ( FDF ) anti-retroviral ( ARV ) products. Matrix launched its FDF business in late calendar year 2007. The increase in third-party revenues contributed by Matrix in calendar year 2008 includes approximately 5.0% unfavorable foreign currency impact as a result of the U.S. Dollar strengthening against both the Indian Rupee and the Euro. 55 Table of Contents In addition to its net revenue, Matrix realized other revenue of $44.9 million through intersegment product development agreements. Intersegment net revenue consists of API sales to the Generics Segment primarily in conjunction with Mylan vertical integration strategy. Segment profitability for the Matrix Segment for calendar year 2008 was $25.0 million compared to $26.7 million in calendar year 2007. The decrease in segment profitability is the result of higher operating expenses, as further explained below, partially offset by increased sales and gross profit. Operating Expenses R&D expense for calendar year 2008 was $317.2 million compared to $182.9 million for calendar year 2007. Excluding R&D expense incurred by the former Merck Generics business for both years, R&D increased by $22.6 million or 16.3% primarily as a result of increased ANDA and other regulatory submissions, payments incurred with respect to product development agreements, and higher expenses associated with Matrix launch of its FDF franchise. During calendar year 2007, the Company recognized charges of $147.0 million to write-off acquired in-process R&D associated with the Matrix acquisition and $1.27 billion to write-off acquired in-process R&D associated with the acquisition of the former Merck Generics business. These amounts represent the fair value of purchased in-process technology for research projects that, as of the closing dates of the acquisitions, had not reached technological feasibility and had no alternative future use. SG&A expense for calendar year 2008 was $1.05 billion compared to $512.4 million for the prior year, an increase of $541.1 million. Excluding SG&A expense incurred by the former Merck Generics business for both years, SG&A expense increased by $73.5 million or 20.5%. This increase was primarily realized by Corporate/Other and the Matrix Segment. The increase in Corporate/Other SG&A expense is due primarily to an increase in professional and consulting fees as well as higher payroll and payroll related costs. The increase in professional and consulting fees is associated primarily with the ongoing integration of the former Merck Generics business. The increase in payroll and related costs is principally attributable to the build-up of additional corporate infrastructure as a direct result of the acquisition. The increase in SG&A in the Matrix Segment is primarily due to costs incurred with respect to a restructuring of Matrix European distribution business, including the closure of several dormant entities. Litigation Settlements, net During calendar year 2008, the Company recorded net charges of $16.6 million related to the settlement of outstanding litigation. Of this amount, the majority relates to the awarding of attorneys fees in a patent infringement case in which Mylan was the defendant. Interest Expense Interest expense for calendar year 2008 totaled $357.0 million compared to $200.4 million for calendar year 2007. The increase is due to the additional debt incurred to finance the acquisition of the former Merck Generics business during the fourth quarter of calendar year 2007. Other Income, net Other income, net, was $11.3 million for calendar year 2008, compared to $97.1 million in calendar year 2007. Calendar year 2007 included a $85.0 million non-cash mark-to-market unrealized gain on a deal-contingent foreign currency option contract that was entered into for the then pending acquisition of the former Merck Generics business, and a loss of $57.2 million on the early repayment of debt related to a tender offer made to holders of the Company Senior Notes and financing fees related to an interim term loan. Excluding these items, other income decreased in calendar year 2008 primarily due to lower interest and dividend income as a result of lower cash balances and available-for-sale securities. 56 Table of Contents Income Tax Expense For calendar year 2008, income tax expense was $137.4 million as compared to $112.8 million for calendar year 2007. The effective tax rate in 2008 was largely influenced by the gain on the sale of Bystolic product rights and the non-deductible non-cash goodwill impairment charge related to Dey. The effective tax rate in the comparable twelve-month period was impacted by the write-off of acquired in-process research and development related to the Merck Generics acquisition and the acquisition of the controlling interest in Matrix. Transition Period Ended December 31, 2007 Compared to Nine-Month Period Ended December 31, 2006 As noted above, transition period refers to the nine-month period from April 1, 2007 through December 31, 2007. In the discussion that follows, comparable nine-month period or prior period refers to the nine-month period from April 1, 2006 through December 31, 2006. Total Revenues and Gross Profit For the transition period, Mylan reported total revenues of $2.18 billion compared to $1.12 billion in the comparable nine-month period. This represents an increase of $1.05 billion or 94%. The acquisition of the former Merck Generics business contributed revenues of $700.6 million, of which $598.5 million are included in the Generics Segment and $102.1 million are included in the Specialty Segment. Matrix contributed revenues of $264.2 million, all of which are included in the Matrix Segment, and are incremental in the current year. The remaining increase is primarily due to growth in Mylan historical business. Other revenue for the transition period was $15.8 million compared to $21.3 million in the comparable nine-month period. The decrease is primarily the result of the recognition, in the prior period, of previously deferred amounts related to the sale of Apokyn , which was fully recognized by December 31, 2006. In arriving at net revenues, gross revenues are reduced by provisions for estimates, including discounts, customer performance and promotions, price adjustments, returns and chargebacks. See the section titled Application of Critical Accounting Policies in this Item 7, for a thorough discussion of our methodology with respect to such provisions. For the transition period, the most significant amounts charged against gross revenues were for chargebacks in the amount of $1.01 billion and customer performance and promotions in the amount of $199.7 million. For the comparable nine-month period, chargebacks of $893.3 million and customer performance and promotions of $122.9 million were charged against gross revenues. Customer performance and promotions include direct rebates as well as promotional programs. Gross profit for the transition period was $874.4 million and gross margins were 40.1%. Gross profit is impacted by certain purchase accounting related items recorded during the nine months ended December 31, 2007 of approximately $148.9 million, which consisted primarily of incremental amortization related to purchased intangible assets and the amortization of the inventory step-up associated with the acquisition of both the former Merck Generics business and Matrix. Excluding such items, gross margins were 47.0% compared to 54.1% for the nine months ended December 31, 2006. A significant portion of gross profit in the transition period, excluding amounts related to the acquisitions of the former Merck Generics business and Matrix, was comprised of fentanyl and new products, including amlodipine. Products generally contribute most significantly to gross margin at the time of their launch and even more so in periods of market exclusivity or limited generic competition. As a result of multiple market entrants shortly after Mylan launch of amlodipine, Mylan did not realize all of the benefits of market exclusivity (less than 180 days) with respect to this product. As it relates to fentanyl, additional competitors entered the market during the current period which had a negative impact on pricing and volume. Additionally, the companies acquired during the period have lower overall gross margins, and, as such, Mylan consolidated gross margin was also unfavorably impacted by this incremental revenue and gross profit. Generics Segment For the transition period, the Generics Segment reported total revenues of $1.81 billion. Generics Segment revenues are derived from sales primarily in the U.S. and Canada (collectively, North America ), Europe, the 57 Table of Contents Middle East and Africa (collectively, EMEA ) and Australia, Japan and New Zealand (collectively, Asia Pacific ). Revenues from North America were $1.27 billion for the transition period compared to $1.12 billion for the comparable nine-month period, representing an increase of $143.8 million or 13%. Of this increase, $54.4 million is the result of the acquisition of the former Merck Generics business. Excluding the impact of the acquisition, total North America revenues increased by $89.4 million or 8%. This increase is the result of new products and favorable volume, partially offset by unfavorable pricing. Products launched subsequent to December 31, 2006, contributed net revenues of $156.5 million, the majority of which was amlodipine. Fentanyl, Mylan AB-rated generic alternative to Duragesic, continued to contribute significantly to the financial results, accounting for approximately 10% of Generics Segment net revenues despite the entrance into the market of additional generic competition in August 2007. As expected, the additional competition had an unfavorable impact on fentanyl pricing. Additional generic competition, as well as the impact of continued consolidation among retail customers, negatively impacted pricing on other products in our portfolio. As is the case in the generic industry, the entrance into the market of additional competition generally has a negative impact on the volume and pricing of the affected products. Doses shipped during the transition period, excluding the impact of acquisitions, increased by over 15% to 11.8 billion. Revenues from EMEA were $373.1 million for the transition period, all of which were the result of the acquisition of the former Merck Generics business. Within EMEA, approximately 70% of net revenues are derived from the three largest markets; France, the United Kingdom ( U.K. ) and Germany. In France, where Mylan S.A.S remains the market leader, revenues for the transition period were augmented by the launch of several first-to-market products. The opposite was observed in the UK where wholesalers decreased their orders to benefit from declining prices driven by intense competition and oversupply. In Germany, the results for the transition period were bolstered by the successful participation in health insurer contracts which were implemented by the German government in April of 2007. Mylan German subsidiary, Mylan dura, has secured contracts covering approximately 70% of all insured individuals. Revenues from Asia Pacific were $170.9 million for the transition period, all of which were the result of the acquisition of the former Merck Generics business. The majority of revenues from Asia Pacific are contributed by Alphapharm, Mylan Australian subsidiary, with the remainder comprised of sales in Japan, New Zealand and India. Alphapharm generated strong results due in part to a strategic partnership entered into in October 2007 with one of Australia leading wholesalers and distributors. Additionally, transition period revenues were bolstered by the launch of several new products. Japan also produced strong results, which is reflective of the overall growth of the generics sector in that country. Beginning in April of 2008, Japanese pharmacists are able to substitute a generic product for its branded counterpart unless such substitution is blocked by the physician. This program is expected to lead to growth in the rate of generic utilization, for which the government has set a goal of 30% by 2012. However, as measures are put in place to increase generic utilization, increased competition from brand companies is expected. Brand companies are increasingly offering higher discounts in order to maintain market share against generics. For the transition period, the segment profitability for the Generics Segment was $590.4 million compared to $510.0 million in the comparable nine-month period, an increase of $80.4 million or 16%. Of this increase approximately $64.5 million is due to the acquisition of the former Merck Generics business. Excluding this amount, segment profitability increased by $15.9 million due to higher revenues, as discussed above, partially offset by increased spending for R&D as we increased our ANDA submission activity. 58 Table of Contents Specialty Segment For the transition period, the Specialty Segment reported total third-party revenues of $102.1 million. The Specialty Segment consists primarily of Dey L.P. ( Dey ), an entity acquired as part of the former Merck Generics business acquisition that focuses on the development, manufacturing and marketing of specialty pharmaceuticals in the respiratory and severe allergy markets. The majority of the Specialty Segment revenues are derived from two products; DuoNeb and EpiPen. DuoNeb is a nebulized unit dose formulation of ipratropium bromide and albuterol sulfate for treatment of chronic obstructive pulmonary disorder ( COPD ). DuoNeb lost exclusivity in July 2007, at which time generic competition entered the market. The impact on sales of the generic competition was not as significant as expected during the transition period, however, sales did subsequently decline significantly as a result of the additional competition. EpiPen, which is used in the treatment of severe allergies, is an epinephrine auto-injector. EpiPen is the number one prescribed treatment for severe allergic reactions with a U.S. market share of over 95%. Prescriptions for EpiPen have continued to grow and during the quarter ended December 31, 2007, have reached the highest prescription volume in the history of the brand. Segment profitability for the Specialty Segment for the transition period was $18.9 million, due to the acquisition of the former Merck Generics business. Matrix Segment For the transition period, the Matrix Segment reported total revenues of $293.8 million, of which $264.2 million represented third-party sales. Approximately 67% of the Matrix Segment third-party net revenues come from the sale of API and intermediates and approximately 27% mainly from the distribution of branded generic products in Europe. Intersegment revenue was derived from API sales to the Generics Segment primarily in conjunction with Mylan vertical integration strategy, as well as revenue earned through intersegment product development agreements. Segment profitability for the Matrix Segment for the transition period was $18.1 million, due to the acquisition of the former Merck Generics business. Operating Expenses Research and development expense for the transition period was $146.1 million compared to $66.8 million in the comparable nine-month period. Transition period R&D includes approximately $71.2 million related to newly acquired entities, all of which was incremental to the comparable nine-month period. Excluding these amounts, R&D expense increased by $8.1 million or 12% as a result of increased clinical studies and higher R&D headcount related to a higher level of ANDA submission activity. Additionally, during the nine months ended December 31, 2007, the Company recognized a charge of $1.27 billion to write-off acquired in-process R&D associated with the former Merck Generics business acquisition. This amount represents the fair value of purchased in-process technology for research projects that, as of the closing date of the acquisition, had not reached technological feasibility and had no alternative future use. The acquisition of the former Merck Generics business and Matrix added $201.8 million of incremental selling, general and administrative expense to the current period. Excluding this amount, SG&A expense increased by $95.1 million or 62% to $247.8 million compared to $152.8 million in the comparable nine-month period. The majority of this increase was realized by Corporate/Other. The increase in Corporate/Other SG&A expense is due to an increase of approximately $60.0 million in both professional and consulting fees and payroll and related expenses, with the remainder due primarily to higher temporary services and depreciation. The increase in professional and consulting fees and temporary services is associated primarily with the integration of the former Merck Generics business. The increase in payroll and related costs is principally attributable to the build-up of additional corporate infrastructure as a direct result of the former Merck Generics business acquisition. 59 Table of Contents Litigation, net Litigation settlements, net, in the transition period yielded income of $2.0 million compared to income of $46.2 million in the comparable nine-month period. These amounts are both due to the favorable settlement of outstanding litigation in the respective periods. Interest Expense Interest expense for the transition period totaled $179.4 million compared to $31.3 million for the nine months ended December 31, 2006. The increase is due to the additional debt incurred to finance the acquisition of the former Merck Generics business. See Liquidity and Capital Resources for further discussion. Other Income, net Other income, net was income of $86.6 million in the transition period compared to $39.8 million in the comparable nine-month period. The most significant items in the current period are net foreign exchange gains consisting mainly of $85.0 million on a contract related to the acquisition of the former Merck Generics business and a loss of $57.2 million on the early repayment of certain debt and expensing certain financing fees, with the remainder of the other income attributable to interest and dividends. As the purpose of the foreign currency option contract was to mitigate exchange rate risk on the Euro-denominated purchase price, in accordance with SFAS No. 133, Accounting for Derivative Instruments and Hedging Activities, as amended ( SFAS No. 133 ), the settlement of this contract was included in current earnings. The $57.2 million loss relates to a tender offer made to holders of the Company Senior Notes and financing fees related to the Interim Term Loan. As part of its strategy to establish a new global capital structure related to the acquisition of the former Merck Generics business, Mylan refinanced its debt, including making a tender offer to holders of its Senior Notes. Included as part of this tender was a premium to holders of the Senior Notes in the amount of $30.8 million. In addition to this premium, approximately $12.1 million of deferred financing fees were written off and approximately $14.3 million for financing fees related to the Interim Term Loan were incurred. In the comparable nine-month period, the Company recorded a net gain of $17.5 million related to a foreign currency forward contract for the acquisition of Matrix. The remainder of the net other income realized in the prior period is the result of interest and dividend income and a $5.0 million payment received from an investee accounted for using the equity method in excess of its carrying amount. Income Tax Expense The Company provision for income taxes was $60.1 million in the nine-month period ending December 31, 2007 as compared to $155.3 million in the nine-month period ending December 31, 2006. The decrease in tax expense is attributable to a reduction in operating income, before the acquired in-process R&D charge, of $255.9 million. The effective tax rate was impacted by the $1.27 billion non-deductible charge related to in-process R&D acquired as part of the Merck transaction. The effective tax rate in 2007 was (5.6%) as compared to 35.0% for the comparable nine-month period in 2006. Fiscal 2007 Overview Total Revenues and Gross Profit Total revenues for fiscal 2007 were $1.61 billion. Generics Segment total revenues were $1.53 billion, and Matrix Segment total revenues were $79.4 million. For the Generics Segment, net revenues increased over the prior year primarily as a result of increased volume and contribution from new products. Pricing was relatively stable compared to the prior year. New products in fiscal 2007 contributed net revenues of $108.7 million primarily due to oxybutynin, which was launched in the third quarter. Excluding new products, fentanyl, which was the only ANDA-approved, AB-rated generic alternative to Duragesic on the market, was a primary driver of both the increased volume and relatively stable pricing. Fentanyl 60 Table of Contents accounted for approximately 18% of Generics Segment net revenues for fiscal 2007. For the Generics Segment, doses shipped during fiscal 2007 increased over 12% from the same prior year period to approximately 14.1 billion. Other revenues for the Generics Segment in fiscal 2007 were $24.9 million, primarily related to the recognition of amounts that had been deferred with respect to Apokyn, which was sold in the prior year, with the remainder related to other business development activities. Net revenues for the Matrix Segment were $95.8 million, of which $79.4 million were sold to third parties. Mylan began consolidating the results of Matrix on January 8, 2007. Approximately 50% of the Matrix Segment third-party revenues come from the sale of API and intermediates and approximately 27% is generated mainly from the distribution of branded generic products in Europe. Intercompany revenue was derived from API sales to the Generics Segment primarily in conjunction with the launch of amlodipine which is a vertically integrated product, as well as revenue earned through intercompany product development agreements. Consolidated gross profit for fiscal 2007 was $843.7 million, and gross margins were 52.3%. For the Generics Segment, gross profit was $846.6 million, while gross margins were 55.2%. For the Matrix Segment gross profit was negatively impacted by approximately $17.6 million representing the reduction of the fair value step-up in inventory, intangible assets and property, plant and equipment recorded as part of the acquisition. For the Generics Segment, a significant portion of gross profit, as well as the increase in gross margins, was comprised of fentanyl and oxybutynin. Fentanyl contributes margins well in excess of most other products in our portfolio, excluding new products. Absent any changes to market dynamics or significant new competition for fentanyl, the Company expects the product to continue to be a significant contributor to sales and gross profit. Products generally contribute most significantly to gross margin at the time of their launch and, as is the case with oxybutynin, even more so in periods of market exclusivity. As is typical in the generics industry, the entrance into the market of other generic competition generally has a negative impact on the volume and pricing of the affected products. Operating Expenses Consolidated R&D expense for fiscal 2007 was $103.7 million. Matrix Segment R&D expense was $12.7 million for fiscal 2007 and Generics Segment R&D expense was $81.8 million. Additionally, during the fourth quarter of fiscal 2007, the Company recognized a charge of $147.0 million to write off acquired in-process R&D associated with the Matrix acquisition. This amount represents the fair value of purchased in-process technology for research projects that, as of the closing date of the acquisition, had not reached technological feasibility and had no alternative future use. SG&A expense for fiscal 2007 was $215.5 million. Generics Segment SG&A expense was $65.4 million. SG&A expense decreased primarily due to approximately $20.0 million of cost savings realized from the closure of Mylan Bertek, the Company branded subsidiary, in the prior year. Partially offsetting this decrease was an increase of approximately $4.5 million in stock-based compensation expense. Corporate and Other SG&A expense was $144.4 million in fiscal 2007. The closure of Mylan Bertek in the prior year accounts for the majority of the decrease realized in fiscal 2007. Partially offsetting this were increases in other general and administrative costs, including stock-based compensation expense of approximately $7.7 million. For Matrix, SG&A expense was $5.8 million in fiscal 2007. Litigation, net Net favorable settlements of $50.1 million were recorded in fiscal 2007. Interest Expense Interest expense for fiscal 2007 totaled $52.3 million. Included in fiscal 2007 interest expense is interest related to the debt assumed in the Matrix acquisition as well as additional debt borrowed to fund the Matrix acquisition, the convertible notes issued in March of 2007, a commitment fee on the revolving credit facilities and the amortization of debt issuance costs. 61 Table of Contents Other Income, net Other income, net was $50.2 million for fiscal 2007 and includes a $16.2 million net gain on a foreign currency forward contract related to the acquisition of Matrix. Additionally, during fiscal 2007, the Company received a cash payment of $5.5 million from an equity method investee. Liquidity and Capital Resources Cash flows from operating activities were $384.4 million for calendar year 2008, consisting primarily of net income (after adding back the non-cash depreciation and amortization expense and the non-cash impairment of $457.5 million), offset by changes in deferred revenue, accounts receivable, net, and deferred taxes of $193.6 million. The change in deferred revenue is driven by the recognition of previously deferred amounts related to the sale of Bystolic rights, and the increase in accounts receivable, net, is the result of increased sales and the timing of cash collections from our customers. Cash used in investing activities was $152.8 million for calendar year 2008. Net sales of investments in available-for-sale securities, which consist of a variety of high-credit quality debt securities, including U.S. government, state and local government and corporate obligations, generated a net $47.7 million in cash. These investments are highly liquid and available for working capital and other needs. As these instruments mature, the funds are generally reinvested in instruments with similar characteristics. Capital expenditures during calendar year 2008 were $165.1 million. These expenditures were incurred primarily for equipment, including the Company previously announced planned expansions and integration plans with respect to the former Merck Generics business acquisition. Also included in investing activities was a cash outflow of $40.0 million to secure a surety bond with respect to the Company lorazepam and clorazepate litigation. Cash used in financing activities was $166.9 million for calendar year 2008. Cash dividends of $137.5 million were paid on the Company 6.5% mandatory convertible preferred stock. In September of 2008, Mylan issued $575.0 million in Cash Convertible Notes, which accounts for the majority of our total proceeds from long term debt of $581.4 million. In conjunction with this offering, the Company entered into a convertible note hedge and warrant transaction that resulted in a net outflow of $98.6 million. The majority of the remaining proceeds following the hedge and warrant transactions were used to repay outstanding indebtedness. In total, debt repayments of $524.5 million were made during calendar year 2008. The convertible note hedge and warrant transactions were entered into between the Company and certain counterparties. The cash convertible note hedge is comprised of purchased cash-settled call options. The sale of the warrants resulted in cash proceeds of $62.6 million which was used along with the proceeds from the issuance of the Cash Convertible Notes, to purchase the bond hedge for approximately $161.2 million. Subject to the conversion provisions outlined in the Cash Convertible Notes Purchase Agreement, the Cash Convertible Notes have an initial conversion reference rate of 75.0751 shares of common stock per $1,000 principal amount (equivalent to an initial conversion reference price of $13.32 per share), subject to adjustment, with the principal amount and remainder payable in cash. The Cash Convertible Notes are not convertible into our common stock or any other securities under any circumstance. The Company is involved in various legal proceedings that are considered normal to its business. While it is not possible to predict the outcome of such proceedings, an adverse outcome in any of these proceedings could materially affect the Company financial position and results of operations. Additionally, for certain contingencies assumed in conjunction with the acquisition of the former Merck Generics business, Merck KGaA, the seller, has indemnified Mylan under the provisions of the Share Purchase Agreement. The inability or denial of Merck KGaA to pay on an indemnified claim, could have a material adverse effect on our financial position or results of operations. The Company Consolidated Balance Sheet as of December 31, 2008, includes a $67.0 million restructuring reserve, which relates to certain estimated exit costs associated with the acquisition of the former Merck Generics 62 Table of Contents business. The plans related to these exit activities have now been finalized. Payments of approximately $9.4 million were made during the calendar year ended December 31, 2008, of which $6.1 million were severance costs and the remaining $3.3 million were other exit costs. In September 2008, following the completion of the comprehensive review of strategic alternatives for Dey, the Company announced its decision to retain the Dey business. This decision included a plan to realign the business, including positioning the Company to divest Dey current facilities over the next two years. As a result, the Company expects to incur certain related exit costs, including related to the realignment of the Dey business. In accordance with the provisions of SFAS No. 146, Accounting for Costs Associated with Exit or Disposal Activities ( SFAS No. 146 ), the Company has recorded a reserve of which approximately $8.0 million remains at December 31, 2008 and made payments of approximately $0.7 million. In addition, the Company recorded approximately $3.7 million for the acceleration of depreciation expense during the calendar year ended December 31, 2008. As finalization of the plans are still in progress, the Company has not yet estimated the total amount expected to be incurred in connection with such activities. However, Mylan expects the majority of such costs will relate to one-time termination benefits and certain asset write-downs and could be significant. The Company is actively pursuing, and is currently involved in, joint projects related to the development, distribution and marketing of both generic and branded products. Many of these arrangements provide for payments by the Company upon the attainment of specified milestones. While these arrangements help to reduce the financial risk for unsuccessful projects, fulfillment of specified milestones or the occurrence of other obligations may result in fluctuations in cash flows. The Company is continuously evaluating the potential acquisition of products, as well as companies, as a strategic part of its future growth. Consequently, the Company may utilize current cash reserves or incur additional indebtedness to finance any such acquisitions, which could impact future liquidity. In addition, on an ongoing basis, the Company reviews its operations including the evaluation of potential divestitures of products and businesses as part of our future strategy. Any divestitures could impact future liquidity.

The Senior Credit Agreement contains financial covenants requiring maintenance of a minimum interest coverage ratio and a senior leverage ratio, both of which are defined within the agreement. These financial covenants were not 63 Table of Contents required to be tested earlier than the quarter ended June 30, 2008. The Company has been compliant with the financial covenants during the calendar year ended December 31, 2008. Contractual Obligations The following table summarizes our contractual obligations at December 31, 2008 and the effect that such obligations are expected to have on our liquidity and cash flows in future periods: Less than One-Three Three-Five (in thousands) Total One Year Years Years Thereafter Operating leases $ 154,336 $ 30,081 $ 43,408 $ 22,942 $ 57,905 Total debt 5,168,800 3,381 354,290 1,067,449 3,743,680 Scheduled interest payments 1,187,199 237,246 454,980 392,610 102,363 Preferred dividends 278,070 139,035 139,035 $ 6,788,405 $ 409,743 $ 991,713 $ 1,483,001 $ 3,903,948 The chart above does not include (i) short-term borrowings held by Matrix in the amount of approximately $151.1 million, which represent working capital facilities with several banks, which are secured first by Matrix current assets and second by Matrix property, plant and equipment and carry interest rates of 4% 14%; and (ii) due to the uncertainty with respect to the timing of future cash flows associated with Company unrecognized tax benefits at December 31, 2008, the Company is unable to make reasonably reliable estimates of the period of cash settlement with the respective taxing authority. Therefore, $166.5 million of unrecognized tax benefits have been excluded from the contractual obligations table above. We lease certain property under various operating lease arrangements that expire generally over the next five years. These leases generally provide us with the option to renew the lease at the end of the lease term. Total debt consists of the U.S. Tranche A Term Loans of $265.6 million, the Euro Tranche A Term Loans of 297.9 ($413.7) million, the U.S. Tranche B Term Loans of $2.50 billion, the Euro Tranche B Term Loans of 514.5 ($714.6) million, $600.0 million in Senior Convertible Notes, $655.4 million in Cash Convertible Notes and $14.6 million of other miscellaneous debt. At December 31, 2008, the $655.4 million of debt related to the Cash Convertible Notes consists of $419.7 million of debt ($575.0 million face amount, net of $155.3 million discount) and a liability with a fair value of $235.8 million related to the bifurcated conversion feature. The purchased call options are assets recorded at their fair value of $235.8 million within other assets in the Consolidated Balance Sheets at December 31, 2008. Scheduled interest payments represent the estimated interest payments on the U.S. Tranche A Term Loans, the Euro Tranche A Term Loans, the U.S. Tranche B Term Loans, the Euro Tranche B Term Loans, the Senior Convertible Notes, the Cash Convertible Notes and other debt. Variable debt interest payments are estimated using current interest rates. At December 31, 2008 and December 31, 2007, the Company has $83.6 million and $51.3 million in letters of credit outstanding. The Company has entered into various product licensing and development agreements. In some of these arrangements, the Company provides funding for the development of the product or to obtain rights to the use of the patent, through milestone payments, in exchange for marketing and distribution rights to the product. Milestones represent the completion of specific contractual events, and it is uncertain if and when these milestones will be achieved, hence, we have not attempted to predict the period in which such milestones would possibly be incurred. In the event that all projects are successful, milestone and development payments of approximately $39.3 million would be paid subsequent to December 31, 2008. The Company periodically enters into licensing agreements with other pharmaceutical companies for the manufacture, marketing and/or sale of pharmaceutical products. These agreements generally call for the Company to pay a percentage of amounts earned from the sale of the product as a royalty. 64 Table of Contents We have entered into employment and other agreements with certain executives and other employees that provide for compensation and certain other benefits. These agreements provide for severance payments under certain circumstances. Impact of Currency Fluctuations and Inflation Because Mylan results are reported in U.S. Dollars, changes in the rate of exchange between the U.S. Dollar and the local currencies in the markets in which Mylan operates, mainly the Euro, Australian Dollar, Indian Rupee, Japanese Yen, Canadian Dollar, and Pound Sterling, affect Mylan results. Application of Critical Accounting Policies Our significant accounting policies are described in Note 2 to Consolidated Financial Statements, which were prepared in accordance with accounting principles generally accepted in the United States of America. Included within these policies are certain policies which contain critical accounting estimates and, therefore, have been deemed to be critical accounting policies. Critical accounting estimates are those which require management to make assumptions about matters that were uncertain at the time the estimate was made and for which the use of different estimates, which reasonably could have been used, or changes in the accounting estimates that are reasonably likely to occur from period to period could have a material impact on our financial condition or results of operations. The Company has identified the following to be its critical accounting policies: the determination of net revenue provisions, intangible assets and goodwill, income taxes, and the impact of existing legal matters. Net Revenue Provisions Net revenues are recognized for product sales when title and risk of loss have transferred to the customer and when provisions for estimates, including discounts, rebates, promotional adjustments, price adjustments, returns, chargebacks and other potential adjustments are reasonably determinable. Accruals for these provisions are presented in the Consolidated Financial Statements as reductions in determining net revenues and in accounts receivable and other current liabilities. Accounts receivable are presented net of allowances relating to these provisions, which were $496.5 million and $420.4 million at December 31, 2008 and December 31, 2007. Other current liabilities include $236.3 million and $301.8 million at December 31, 2008 and December 31, 2007, for certain rebates and other adjustments that are paid to indirect customers. The following is a rollforward of the most significant provisions for estimated sales allowances during calendar year 2008: Current Provision Checks/Credits Related to Sales Effects of Balance at Issued to Third Made in the Foreign Balance at (in thousands) 12/31/2007 Parties Current Period Exchange 12/31/2008 Chargebacks $ 215,272 $ (1,485,012 ) $ 1,456,089 $ (3,537 ) $ 182,812 Promotions and indirect rebates $ 302,495 $ (724,742 ) $ 753,746 $ (14,285 ) $ 317,214 Returns $ 90,689 $ (73,591 ) $ 66,726 $ (2,529 ) $ 81,295 The accrual for chargebacks decreased as a result of numerous factors including a decrease in the estimate of the amount of inventory on the shelves of our U.S. wholesale customers, a shift in sales to customers for whom chargebacks are not offered in Germany, and a decrease in Australia in conjunction with the country-wide, government-mandated decrease in generic pharmaceutical pricing. The accrual for promotions and indirect rebates increased primarily due to accruals for new products in the U.S. and an increase in the overall business in markets such as France and Germany, offset by decreases in Canada and the U.K. Provisions for estimated discounts, rebates, promotional and other credits require a lower degree of subjectivity and are less complex in nature yet, combined, represent a significant portion of the overall provisions. These provisions are estimated based on historical payment experience, historical relationships to revenues, estimated customer inventory levels and contract terms. Such provisions are determinable due to the limited number of assumptions and consistency of historical experience. Others, such as price adjustments, returns and chargebacks, 65 Table of Contents require management to make more subjective judgments and evaluate current market conditions. These provisions are discussed in further detail below. Price Adjustments Price adjustments, which include shelf stock adjustments, are credits issued to reflect decreases in the selling prices of our products. Shelf stock adjustments are based upon the amount of product that our customers have remaining in their inventories at the time of the price reduction. Decreases in our selling prices and the issuance of credits are discretionary decisions made by us to reflect market conditions. Amounts recorded for estimated price adjustments are based upon specified terms with direct customers, estimated launch dates of competing products, estimated declines in market price and, in the case of shelf stock adjustments, estimates of inventory held by the customer. In most cases, data with respect to the level of inventory held by the customer is obtained directly from certain of our largest customers. Additionally, internal estimates are prepared based upon historical buying patterns and estimated end-user demand. Such information allows us to assess the impact that a price adjustment will have given the quantity of inventory on hand. We regularly monitor these and other factors and evaluate our reserves and estimates as additional information becomes available. A variance of 5% between estimated and actual inventory levels would have an effect on our reserve balance of approximately $3.0 million. Returns Consistent with industry practice, we maintain a return policy that allows our customers to return product within a specified period prior to and subsequent to the expiration date. Our estimate of the provision for returns is based upon our historical experience with actual returns, which is applied to the level of sales for the period that corresponds to the period during which our customers may return product. This period is known by us based on the shelf lives of our products at the time of shipment. Additionally, we consider factors such as levels of inventory in the distribution channel, product dating, and expiration period, size and maturity of the market prior to a product launch, entrance into the market of additional generic competition, changes in formularies or launch of over-the-counter products, and make adjustments to the provision for returns in the event that it appears that actual product returns may differ from our established reserves. We obtain data with respect to the level of inventory in the channel directly from certain of our largest customers. Although the introduction of additional generic competition does not give our customers the right to return product outside of our established policy, we do recognize that such competition could ultimately lead to increased returns. We analyze this on a case-by-case basis, when significant, and make adjustments to increase our reserve for product returns as necessary. A change of 5% in the estimated product return rate used in our calculation of our return reserve would have an effect on our reserve balance of approximately $4.0 million. Chargebacks The provision for chargebacks is the most significant and complex estimate used in the recognition of revenue. The Company markets products directly to wholesalers, distributors, retail pharmacy chains, mail order pharmacies and group purchasing organizations. The Company also markets products indirectly to independent pharmacies, managed care organizations, hospitals, nursing homes and pharmacy benefit management companies, collectively referred to as indirect customers. Mylan enters into agreements with its indirect customers to establish contract pricing for certain products. The indirect customers then independently select a wholesaler from which to actually purchase the products at these contracted prices. Alternatively, certain wholesalers may enter into agreements with indirect customers that establish contract pricing for certain products, which the wholesalers provide. Under either arrangement, Mylan will provide credit to the wholesaler for any difference between the contracted price with the indirect party and the wholesaler invoice price. Such credit is called a chargeback, while the difference between the contracted price and the wholesaler invoice price is referred to as the chargeback rate. The provision for chargebacks is based on expected sell-through levels by our wholesaler customers to indirect customers, as well as estimated wholesaler inventory levels. For the latter, in most cases, inventory levels are obtained directly from certain of our largest wholesalers. Additionally, internal estimates are prepared based upon historical buying patterns and estimated end-user demand. Such information allows us to estimate the potential chargeback that we may ultimately owe to our customers given the quantity of inventory on hand. We continually monitor our provision for chargebacks and evaluate our reserve and estimates as additional information becomes available. A change of 5% in the estimated sell-through levels by our wholesaler customers and in the estimated wholesaler inventory levels would have an effect on our reserve balance of approximately $8.0 million. While we do not anticipate any significant changes to the methodologies that we use to measure chargebacks, customer performance and promotions or returns, the balances within these reserves can fluctuate significantly 66 Table of Contents through the consistent application of our methodologies. Historically, we have not recorded in any current period any material amounts related to adjustments made to prior period reserves. Should any material amounts from any prior period be recorded in any current period such amounts will be disclosed. Intangible Assets and Goodwill We account for acquired businesses using the purchase method of accounting, which requires that the assets acquired and liabilities assumed be recorded at the date of acquisition at their respective estimated fair values. The cost to acquire a business, including transaction costs, has been allocated to the underlying net assets of the acquired business based on estimates of their respective fair values. Amounts allocated to acquired in-process research and development have been expensed at the date of acquisition. Intangible assets are amortized over the expected life of the asset. Any excess of the purchase price over the estimated fair values of the net assets acquired is recorded as goodwill. The judgments made in determining the estimated fair value assigned to each class of assets acquired and liabilities assumed, as well as asset lives, can materially impact our results of operations. Fair values and useful lives are determined based on, among other factors, the expected future period of benefit of the asset, the various characteristics of the asset and projected cash flows. Because this process involves management making estimates with respect to future sales volumes, pricing, new product launches, anticipated cost environment and overall market conditions and because these estimates form the basis for the determination of whether or not an impairment charge should be recorded, these estimates are considered to be critical accounting estimates. Goodwill and intangible assets are reviewed for impairment annually or when events or other changes in circumstances indicate that the carrying amount of the assets may not be recoverable. Impairment of goodwill and indefinite-lived intangibles is determined to exist when the fair value is less than the carrying value of the net assets being tested. Impairment of definite-lived intangibles is determined to exist when undiscounted cash flows related to the assets are less than the carrying value of the assets being tested. Future events and decisions may lead to asset impairment and/or related costs. As discussed above with respect to determining an asset fair value and useful life, because this process involves management making certain estimates and because these estimates form the basis for the determination of whether or not an impairment charge should be recorded, these estimates are considered to be critical accounting estimates. The Company will continue to assess the carrying value of its goodwill and intangible assets in accordance with applicable accounting guidance. Income Taxes We compute our income taxes based on the statutory tax rates and tax planning opportunities available to the Company in the various jurisdictions in which we earn income. Significant judgment is required in determining the Company income taxes and in evaluating its tax positions. We establish reserves in accordance with FASB Interpretation No. 48, Accounting for Uncertainty in Income Taxes an Interpretation of FASB Statement 109 ( FIN 48 ). FIN 48 provides that the tax effects from an uncertain tax position be recognized in the Company financial statements, only if the position is more likely than not of being sustained upon audit, based on the technical merits of the position. The Company adjusts these reserves in light of changing facts and circumstances, such as the settlement of a tax audit. The Company provision for income taxes includes the impact of reserve provisions and changes to reserves. Favorable resolution would be recognized as a reduction to the Company provision for income taxes in the period of resolution. The Company records valuation allowances to reduce deferred tax assets to the amount that is more likely than not to be realized. When assessing the need for valuation allowances, the Company considers future taxable income and ongoing prudent and feasible tax planning strategies. Should a change in circumstances lead to a change in judgment about the realizability of deferred tax assets in future years, the Company would adjust related valuation allowances in the period that the change in circumstances occurs, along with a corresponding increase or charge to income taxes. 67 Table of Contents The resolution of tax reserves and changes in valuation allowances could be material to the Company results of operations or financial position. Legal Matters The Company is involved in various legal proceedings, some of which involve claims for substantial amounts. An estimate is made to accrue for a loss contingency relating to any of these legal proceedings if it is probable that a liability was incurred as of the date of the financial statements and the amount of loss can be reasonably estimated. Because of the subjective nature inherent in assessing the outcome of litigation and because of the potential that an adverse outcome in a legal proceeding could have a material adverse effect on the Company financial position or results of operations, such estimates are considered to be critical accounting estimates. Recent Accounting Pronouncements In June 2008, the Financial Accounting Standards Board ( FASB ) issued FASB Staff Position ( FSP ) No. EITF 03-6-1, Determining Whether Instruments Granted in Share-Based Payment Transactions Are Participating Securities ( FSP No. EITF 03-6-1 ). FSP No. EITF 03-6-1 states that unvested share-based payment awards that contain nonforfeitable rights to dividends or dividend equivalents (whether paid or unpaid) are participating securities and shall be included in the computation of earnings per share pursuant to the two-class method. FSP No. EITF 03-6-1 is effective for fiscal years beginning after December 15, 2008. The adoption of FSP No. EITF 03-6-01 will not have an impact on the Company Consolidated Financial Statements. In May 2008, the FASB issued FSP No. APB 14-1, Accounting for Convertible Debt Instruments That May Be Settled in Cash Upon Conversion (Including Partial Cash Settlement) ( FSP No. APB 14-1 ). Under the new rules for convertible debt instruments (including our Senior Convertible Notes) that may be settled entirely or partially in cash upon conversion, an entity should separately account for the liability and equity components of the instrument in a manner that reflects the issuer economic interest cost. The effect of the new rules for the debentures is that the equity component would be included in the paid-in-capital section of stockholders equity on our consolidated balance sheet and the value of the equity component would be treated as original issue discount for purposes of accounting for the debt component of the Senior Convertible Notes. FSP No. APB 14-1 will be effective for fiscal years beginning after December 15, 2008, and for interim periods within those fiscal years, with retrospective application required. Higher interest expense will result through the accretion of the discounted carrying value of the Senior Convertible Notes to their face amount over the term of the Senior Convertible Notes. Prior period interest expense will also be higher than previously reported interest expense due to retrospective application. Early adoption is not permitted. The Company has evaluated the impact of adopting FSP No. APB 14-1 on its Consolidated Financial Statements and determined that the retrospective application will increase the net loss available to common shareholders by approximately $10.0 million for the nine months ended December 31, 2007, and $15.0 million for calendar year ended December 31, 2008. In addition, at December 31, 2008, additional paid-in capital will increase by $85.0 million and long-term debt, retained earnings and tax assets will decrease by $87.0 million, $26.0 million and $28.0 million, respectively. In April 2008, the FASB issued FSP No. FAS 142-3, Determination of the Useful Life of Intangible Assets ( FSP No. FAS 142-3 ). FSP No. FAS 142-3 amends the factors that should be considered in developing renewal or extension assumptions used to determine the useful life of a recognized intangible asset under SFAS No. 142, in order to improve the consistency between the useful life of a recognized intangible asset under SFAS No. 142 and the period of expected cash flows used to measure the fair value of the asset under SFAS No. 141(R), Business Combinations ( SFAS No. 141(R) ) and other accounting principles generally accepted in the United States of America ( GAAP ). FSP No. FAS 142-3 is effective for fiscal years beginning after December 15, 2008. The adoption of FSP No. FAS 142-3 will not have a material impact on the Company Consolidated Financial Statements. In March 2008, the FASB issued SFAS No. 161, Disclosures about Derivative Instruments and Hedging Activities an amendment of FASB Statement No. 133 ( SFAS No. 161 ). SFAS No. 161 requires enhanced disclosures about an entity derivative and hedging activities, including (i) how and why an entity uses derivative instruments, (ii) how derivative instruments and related hedged items are accounted for under SFAS No. 133, and 68 Table of Contents (iii) how derivative instruments and related hedged items affect an entity financial position, financial performance, and cash flows. This standard is effective for fiscal years beginning after November 15, 2008. Management is currently assessing the impact of the disclosures on the Company Consolidated Financial Statements. In March 2008, the Emerging Issues Task Force ( EITF ) issued EITF No. 07-5, Determining Whether an Instrument (or Embedded Feature) is Indexed to an Entity Own Stock ( EITF No. 07-5 ). EITF No. 07-5 states that if an instrument (or an embedded feature) has the characteristics of a derivative instrument under paragraphs 6-9 of SFAS No. 133, and is indexed to an entity own stock, it is necessary to evaluate whether it is classified in shareholders equity (or would be classified in stockholders equity if it were a freestanding instrument). EITF No. 07-5 is effective for fiscal years beginning after December 15, 2008. The adoption of EITF No. 07-5 will not have a material impact on the Company Consolidated Financial Statements. On January 1, 2008, the Company adopted SFAS No. 159, The Fair Value Option for Financial Assets and Financial Liabilities including an amendment of FASB Statement No. 115 ( SFAS No. 159 ). SFAS No. 159 permits entities to choose to measure many financial instruments and certain other assets and liabilities at fair value on an instrument-by-instrument basis (the fair value option) with changes in fair value reported in earnings. The Company already records marketable securities at fair value in accordance with SFAS No. 115, Accounting for Certain Investments in Debt and Equity Securities ( SFAS No. 115 ), and derivative contracts and hedging activities at fair value in accordance with SFAS No. 133. The adoption of SFAS No. 159 did not have a material impact on the Company Consolidated Financial Statements as management did not elect the fair value option for any other financial instruments or certain other assets and liabilities. On January 1, 2008, the Company adopted Statement 133 Implementation Issue No. E23, Hedging General: Issues Involving the Application of the Shortcut Method under Paragraph 58 ( Issue No. E23 ). Issue No. E23 provides guidance on certain practice issues related to the application of the shortcut method by amending paragraph 68 of SFAS No. 133 with respect to the conditions that must be met in order to apply the shortcut method for assessing hedge effectiveness of interest rate swaps. In addition to applying the provisions of Issue No. E23 on hedging arrangements designated on or after January 1, 2008, an assessment was required to be made on January 1, 2008 to determine whether preexisting hedging arrangements met the provisions of Issue No. E23 as of their original inception. Management performed such an assessment and determined that the adoption of Issue No. E23 did not have a material impact on preexisting hedging arrangements. In December 2007, the FASB issued SFAS No. 141(R). SFAS No. 141(R) replaces SFAS No. 141, Business Combinations, ( SFAS No. 141 ) and retains the fundamental requirements in SFAS No. 141, including that the purchase method be used for all business combinations and for an acquirer to be identified for each business combination. This standard defines the acquirer as the entity that obtains control of one or more businesses in the business combination and establishes the acquisition date as the date that the acquirer achieves control instead of the date that the consideration is transferred. SFAS No. 141(R) requires an acquirer in a business combination, including business combinations achieved in stages (step acquisition), to recognize the assets acquired, liabilities assumed, and any noncontrolling interest in the acquiree at the acquisition date, measured at their fair values at that date, with limited exceptions. It also requires the recognition of assets acquired and liabilities assumed arising from certain contractual contingencies as of the acquisition date, measured at their acquisition-date fair values. SFAS No. 141(R) is effective for any business combination with an acquisition date on or after January 1, 2009. The Company is currently evaluating the potential impact of SFAS No. 141(R) on the Consolidated Financial Statements. In December 2007, the FASB issued SFAS No. 160, Noncontrolling Interests in Consolidated Financial Statements an amendment of ARB No. 51 ( SFAS No. 160 ). SFAS No. 160 amends Accounting Research Bulletin No. 51, Consolidated Financial Statements, to establish accounting and reporting standards for the noncontrolling interest in a subsidiary and for the deconsolidation of a subsidiary. This standard defines a noncontrolling interest, sometimes called a minority interest, as the portion of equity in a subsidiary not attributable, directly or indirectly, to a parent. SFAS No. 160 requires, among other items, that a noncontrolling interest be included in the consolidated balance sheet within equity separate from the parent equity; consolidated net income to be reported at amounts inclusive of both the parent and noncontrolling interest shares and, separately, the amounts of consolidated net income attributable to the parent and noncontrolling interest all on the consolidated statement of operations; and if a subsidiary is deconsolidated, any retained noncontrolling equity investment in the 69 Table of Contents former subsidiary be measured at fair value and a gain or loss be recognized in net income based on such fair value. SFAS No. 160 is effective for fiscal years beginning after December 15, 2008. Although certain captions and disclosures will be revised, the adoption of SFAS No. 160 will not have a material impact on the Company Consolidated Financial Statements. In March 2007, the EITF issued EITF No. 06-10, Accounting for Collateral Assignment Split-Dollar Life Insurance Arrangements ( EITF No. 06-10 ). Under the provisions of EITF No. 06-10, an employer is required to recognize a liability for the postretirement benefit related to a collateral assignment split-dollar life insurance arrangement with the employee. The provisions of EITF No. 06-10 also require an employer to recognize and measure the asset in a collateral assignment split-dollar life insurance arrangement based on the nature and substance of the arrangement. The Company adopted the provisions of EITF No. 06-10 as of January 1, 2008. As a result of the adoption, the Company recognized a liability of $8.3 million, representing the present value of the future premium payments to be made under the existing policies. In accordance with the transition provisions of EITF No. 06-10, this amount was recorded as a direct decrease to retained earnings. In March 2007, the EITF issued EITF No. 06-04, Accounting for Deferred Compensation and Postretirement Benefit Aspects of Endorsed Split-Dollar Life Insurance Arrangements ( EITF No. 06-4 ), which concludes that an employer should recognize a liability for post-employment benefits promised an employee based on the substantive arrangement between the employer and the employee. The Company adopted the provisions of EITF No. 06-04 as of January 1, 2008. The adoption of EITF No. 06-04 did not have a material impact on the Company Consolidated Financial Statements.
