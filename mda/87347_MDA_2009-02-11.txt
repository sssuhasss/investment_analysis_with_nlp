Item 7. Management Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations. The following discussion and analysis contains forward-looking statements including, without limitation, statements relating to our plans, strategies, objectives, expectations, intentions and resources. Such forward-looking statements should be read in conjunction with our disclosures under Item 1A. Risk Factors of this Report. Executive Overview As 2008 progressed, early optimism of continuing growth in oil and natural gas exploration and production activity was dampened by growing evidence of weakening economic conditions that began to significantly weigh upon the energy markets in early October. While such weakening did not prevent oil prices from ramping up steeply to $147-per-barrel in July, the velocity of the subsequent reversal to under $40-per-barrel by the end of the year was supported by economic reports and forecasts that confirmed the majority of the OECD (Organization for Economic Co-operation and Development) countries to be in recession by the end of the third quarter. Consequently, global oil demand forecasts for 2008 dropped from quarter to quarter and it became apparent that moderating oil demand growth in the non-OECD economies would no longer be sufficient to offset a continuing three-year demand decline within the OECD countries. As a result, 2008 saw the first global oil demand decrease in 25 years. In the fourth quarter OPEC elected to cut production by a total of 3.7 million barrels per day to remove supply and support prices, however, the time taken for these cuts to be felt in the market, and for the resultant increased spare capacity to be reabsorbed by future growth, was large enough for E&P customers to cut investment. This translated to lower demand and weaker prices for oilfield services in an increasing number of areas late in the fourth quarter. The natural gas markets presented a similar picture. While activity was initially maintained in the first part of the year, the developing recession in the latter part of 2008 led to lower industrial demand in the developed economies although commercial and residential demand was maintained. In North America, supply increased by 6% in 2008 largely as a result of industry deployment of advanced drilling, production and completion technologies leading to higher gas production and consequently greater storage levels in spite of lower Canadian imports and decreased LNG (Liquified Natural Gas) supplies. Consequently, more LNG has become available for other international importers and, as a result, the majority of the developed economies are well supplied for their needs. Within the United States, the world largest natural gas market, this translated to reduced gas exploration and production investment with lower demand for oilfield services and consequent pressure on service pricing in a number of areas by the fourth quarter as the market price of natural gas fell. In international markets however, increasing demand for natural gas in the developing economies led to sustained drilling activity with drilling rigs previously deployed on oil exploration and development moving to natural gas activity in some regions. Within this volatile market, Schlumberger Oilfield Services revenue in 2008 grew by 20% versus 2007, with demand strongest in international markets. Year-on-year growth rates reached 28% in Latin America, 24% in Europe/CIS/Africa, 18% in Middle East & Asia and 11% in North America. All Technologies experienced double-digit growth, most notably in Well Services, Drilling & Measurements and Wireline. These results mask, however, a rapid reversal that occurred late in the year in response to the worsening economic climate, and, after three quarters of overall growth, revenues in the fourth quarter declined sequentially through weakening local currencies and reduced customer spending, in addition to seasonal factors. A variety of new Schlumberger products and services contributed to growth in 2008. These included further penetration of Scanner Family* advanced wireline logging services and Scope* imaging-while-drilling technologies into new markets as customers sought to increase their understanding of complex reservoirs. Growth through measurement integration also extended into the production domain with offerings such as the StimMAP* LIVE real-time fracture monitoring service that combines the measurement capability of Wireline with the pressure pumping expertise of Well Services to track the progress of fracture stimulation in real time 17 Table of Contents Part II, Item 7 to be able to control the operation for maximum effect. Other new production-related services included ACTive* coiled-tubing services that combine a downhole sensor package with a fiber-optic communications system to monitor coiled-tubing-enabled operations in real time. Acquisitions in 2008 also served to increase Schlumberger capabilities or added specific new technologies to the portfolio. In Canada, Schlumberger and First Reserve Corporation acquired Saxon Energy Services Inc., a land drilling contractor with major activity in North and South America. Schlumberger had already enjoyed a long association with Saxon, including operation of joint ventures in Mexico and Colombia for the supply of drilling services that support integrated project management activities. Also in Canada, Schlumberger acquired the business of Extreme Engineering Limited, a leading supplier of unmanned measurement-while-drilling systems to land markets in the United States and Canada. Other technology acquisitions included Integrated Exploration Systems, a Germany-based technology leader in petroleum systems modeling, and Staag Imaging, a Houston-based provider of leading-edge depth imaging technologies for seismic data processing. The performance of WesternGeco, where full-year 2008 revenue fell by 4% versus 2007, was limited by a combination of lower Multiclient sales, reduced Land activity, and cost inflation that affected Marine operations. Among these factors, Multiclient sales were particularly weak with the sharp decrease reported in the first quarter not being reversed later in the year as a clear indication of customers restricting discretionary spending for seismic data. Contract awards remained strong, however, and WesternGeco reported a record backlog of $1.8 billion at the end of the year, up $700 million from the end of the third quarter. In spite of this weaker-than-expected performance, WesternGeco made significant progress in the introduction of new technology during the year. These included a new proprietary full-azimuth marine acquisition technique, known as coil shooting, that leverages the signal fidelity and streamer-steering capability of Q* technology to provide resolution in sub-salt applications where wide-azimuth techniques mobilize too many resources. Coil shooting provides the same quality survey but uses only one vessel to do so. In other new technology developments, the UniQ* latest-generation land acquisition system was unveiled. This substantially increases the number of acquisition channels available and in combination with proprietary vibrator source technology delivers a sharper image and wider coverage. The sharp drop in oil and gas prices in the latter part of 2008 that resulted in lower activity, higher inventories, and the belief that demand will erode further in 2009 as a result of the economic slowdown, has led to rapid and substantial reductions in exploration and production expenditure. At current prices most of the new categories of hydrocarbon resources such as heavy oil, tar sands, coal-to-liquids, or gas-to-liquids are not economic to develop. In addition, it will take time for inflation to be removed from the E&P supply chain to bring finding and development costs more in line with lower oil and gas prices. Schlumberger therefore expects 2009 activity to weaken across the board, with the most significant declines occurring in North American gas drilling, Russian oil production enhancement, and in mature offshore basins. Exploration offshore will also be somewhat curtailed but commitments already planned are likely to be honored. Seismic expenditures, particularly for multiclient data, are likely to decrease from the levels of 2008. Furthermore, pricing erosion will compound these effects on revenue. In this market we are taking the necessary actions early in 2009 to adjust our operating cost base while preserving our long-term commitments to technology development, key skill sets and service and product quality. The most important indicator of a future recovery in oilfield services activity will be a stabilization and recovery in the demand for oil. The recent years of increased exploration and production spending, however, have not been sufficient to substantially improve the supply situation. The age of the production base, accelerating decline rates and the smaller size of recently developed fields will mean that any prolonged reduction in investment will lead to a strong rebound in activity in the future. 18 Table of Contents Part II, Item 7 The following discussion and analysis of results of operations should be read in conjunction with the Consolidated Financial Statements .

Oilfield Services Fourth Quarter 2008 Results Fourth-quarter revenue of $6.26 billion was 2% lower sequentially but was 15% higher year-on-year. Sequentially, Europe/CIS/Africa revenue declined primarily due to a weakening of the local currencies against the US dollar and from lower activity in Russia as the result of reduced customer spending and seasonal slowdowns. In Latin America, revenue fell due to weaker local currencies and lower activity in the Venezuela/Trinidad & Tobago and Mexico/Central America GeoMarkets. Middle East & Asia declined on lower activity in the Australia/Papua New Guinea/New Zealand and Qatar GeoMarkets. These decreases, however, were partially offset by an increase in North America as the result of strong activity in the US Gulf of Mexico and US land West GeoMarkets. Local currency changes reduced Oilfield Services fourth-quarter revenue by approximately 3%. Fourth-quarter pretax operating income of $1.60 billion was 6% lower sequentially but 4% higher year-on-year. Sequentially, pretax operating margin decreased from 26.7% to 25.6% primarily as a result of reduced activity levels in the Europe/CIS/Africa, Latin America and Middle East & Asia Areas, partially offset by the improvement in overall activity and a more favorable revenue mix in North America. North America Revenue of $1.56 billion increased 4% sequentially and 17% year-on-year. Pretax operating income of $346 million increased 9% sequentially and 2% year-on-year. 19 Table of Contents Part II, Item 7 Sequentially, the US Gulf of Mexico GeoMarket activity recovered from the slowdown experienced during the hurricane season of the third quarter and realized further growth on a higher ultra deep-water rig count that led to strong demand for Wireline, Well Testing and Well Services technologies. The US land West GeoMarket revenue increased on strong demand for Well Services and Drilling & Measurements services and Artificial Lift products while the Alaska GeoMarket experienced a seasonal increase in activity that resulted in robust demand for Well Services and Drilling & Measurements technologies. SIS experienced growth from strong year-end software and hardware sales. These increases were partially offset by decreased revenue in the US land Central and North GeoMarkets on reducing rig count that accelerated at quarter end. Canada GeoMarket revenue was also lower primarily as the result of the weakening of the Canadian dollar. Pretax operating margin improved sequentially from 21.1% to 22.3% mainly as a result of stronger activity levels and increased high-margin services in the US Gulf of Mexico, US land West and Alaska GeoMarkets. These increases were partially offset by pricing pressure in the US land Central and North GeoMarkets. Latin America Revenue of $1.11 billion was 3% lower sequentially but increased 18% year-on-year. Pretax operating income of $200 million decreased 13% sequentially and 4% year-on-year. Sequentially, revenue in the Venezuela/Trinidad & Tobago GeoMarket declined as a result of lower demand for Wireline and Well Services technologies and Completions products, while the Mexico/Central America GeoMarket experienced lower activity in Integrated Project Management (IPM) projects. These decreases were partially offset by higher offshore exploration-related activity in the Brazil GeoMarket that led to robust demand for Wireline, Well Testing and Drilling & Measurements services, while activity in the Peru/Colombia/Ecuador GeoMarket increased due to strong demand for Artificial Lift and SIS products. Area revenue was also reduced by approximately 4% due to the weakening of local currencies against the US dollar. Pretax operating margin declined sequentially from 20.1% to 18.0% from lower activity and a less favorable revenue mix in the Venezuela/Trinidad & Tobago GeoMarket, reduced gain share from IPM projects in the Peru/Colombia/Ecuador GeoMarket, and cost inflation and a less favorable revenue mix in the Mexico/Central America GeoMarket. Europe/CIS/Africa Revenue of $2.05 billion decreased 5% sequentially but increased 16% year-on-year. Pretax operating income of $533 million decreased 15% sequentially but was 8% higher year-on-year. Sequentially, Area revenue was 5% lower due to the weakening of local currencies against the US dollar particularly in the North Sea, Continental Europe and Russia. Additionally, Russia experienced significant reductions in activity from lower customer spending and the seasonal slowdown in Sakhalin. Lower Framo revenue also contributed to the decline. These decreases were partially offset by significantly increased activity in the Libya GeoMarket from strong demand for Artificial Lift products and for Drilling & Measurements, Well Testing and Wireline services, as well as in the Continental Europe GeoMarket from higher demand for Wireline and Drilling & Measurements technologies. Pretax operating margin decreased sequentially from 29.0% to 26.1% primarily due to lower activity and a less favorable revenue mix in the North Sea and Nigeria & Gulf of Guinea GeoMarkets and Russia. The decrease in Framo revenue also contributed to this result. Middle East & Asia Revenue of $1.47 billion was 2% lower sequentially but 9% higher year-on-year. Pretax operating income of $491 million decreased 7% sequentially but increased 4% year-on-year. Sequentially, Area revenue declined mainly as a result of weather-related effects in the Australia/Papua New Guinea/New Zealand and China/Japan/Korea GeoMarkets, lower activity in Qatar, a less favorable activity 20 Table of Contents Part II, Item 7 mix in Brunei/Malaysia/Philippines and reduced customer spending in the China/Japan/Korea and Arabian GeoMarkets. These declines primarily affected demand for Wireline, Drilling & Measurements and Well Services technologies, but were partially offset by the positive impact of retroactive price adjustments for a Wireline contract in addition to growth in the Gulf GeoMarket for Artificial Lift products and Well Services and Drilling & Measurements technologies. Pretax operating margin declined sequentially from 35.5% to 33.5% primarily due to the overall lower level of activity in the Area as well as a less favorable revenue mix in the Arabian and India GeoMarkets. Total Year 2008 Results Full-year 2008 revenue of $24.28 billion increased 20% versus 2007 driven by Area growth of 28% in Latin America, 24% in Europe/CIS/Africa, 18% in Middle East & Asia and 11% in North America. All Technologies experienced double-digit growth most notably in Well Services, Drilling & Measurements and Wireline. Pretax operating income of $6.50 billion in 2008 was 9% higher than 2007. However, pretax operating margin declined 256 basis points (bps) to 26.8% primarily due to reduced pricing for well stimulation services in the US land GeoMarkets, a higher mix of low-margin third-party managed services in the Mexico/Central America GeoMarket and cost inflation across all Areas. North America Revenue of $5.91 billion grew 11% versus 2007. Growth was led by the US land West GeoMarket mostly due to increased gas shale activity that resulted in robust demand for Well Services and Drilling & Measurements technologies and by the US land Central GeoMarket on higher rig activity and strong Artificial Lift product sales. The Canada GeoMarket revenue was higher from demand for Well Services and Drilling & Measurements technologies while the US Gulf of Mexico GeoMarket grew on increased deepwater activity the resulted in strong demand for Drilling & Measurements and Wireline services in addition to Completion Systems products. Pretax operating margin decreased 557 bps to 23.2% primarily as the result of lower pricing for well stimulation services in the US land GeoMarkets and cost inflation across the Area. Latin America Revenue of $4.23 billion was 28% higher than 2007 on double-digit growth across all GeoMarkets. The Mexico/Central America GeoMarket increased on significantly higher IPM activity while the Peru/Colombia/Ecuador GeoMarket also experienced increased IPM activity in addition to robust demand for Wireline services and for Artificial Lift and SIS products. The Brazil GeoMarket grew on higher offshore activity that resulted in stronger demand for Well Testing, Wireline and Well Services technologies. The Venezuela/Trinidad and Tobago GeoMarket experienced increased demand for Wireline, Drilling & Measurements and Well Services activities. Pretax operating margin of 20.3% declined 262 bps versus 2007 as a result of an increased mix of low-margin third-party managed services in the Mexico/Central America GeoMarket and cost inflation across the Area. Europe/CIS/Africa Revenue of $8.18 billion increased 24% versus the same period last year. Growth was led by Russia which experienced strong demand for Wireline, Well Services and Drilling & Measurements technologies. The West & South Africa, North Sea and Caspian GeoMarkets grew on increased exploration-related services as well as strong demand for Well Services technologies. The Continental Europe GeoMarket was higher due to strong drilling-related activities and demand for SIS products. The consolidation of Framo also contributed to the increase. 21 Table of Contents Part II, Item 7 Pretax operating margin decreased 112 bps to 27.4% primarily as a result of reduced pricing in the Libya GeoMarket and a less favorable revenue mix in the Nigeria & Gulf of Guinea GeoMarket and Russia. The consolidation of Framo also reduced total Area margin. Middle East & Asia Revenue of $5.72 billion was 18% higher than the prior year. All GeoMarkets experienced growth, most notably in the Arabian, Australia/Papua New Guinea/New Zealand, Gulf, and East Mediterranean GeoMarkets. Among the Technologies, growth was strongest in Wireline, Drilling & Measurements, Well Services and Well Testing. Pretax operating margin was nearly flat at 35.0% as the positive impact of the higher overall activity level was offset by cost inflation. Total Year 2007 Results Full-year 2007 revenue of $20.31 billion increased 21% versus 2006, led by Area growths of 31% in both the Middle East & Asia, and in Europe/CIS/Africa and 29% in Latin America, while North America remained essentially flat. Pretax operating income of $5.96 billion in 2007 was 28% higher than 2006. Pretax operating margins of 29.3% improved 164 bps in 2007 versus 2006. Higher activity and expansion of higher-margin new technology deployment across Europe/CIS/Africa, Middle East & Asia and Latin America Areas were the principal contributors to this performance. In North America, pricing erosion in pressure-pumping well-stimulation activities moderated year-on-year margin growth within the Area. Among the GeoMarkets, the greatest increases in revenue were recorded in the North Sea, followed by Mexico/Central America, Arabian, West & South Africa, and Venezuela/Trinidad & Tobago. Significant demand was seen for all Technologies led by Drilling & Measurements, Wireline, Well Testing, and Completions Systems as customers continued to improve exploration and production performance in the search for new hydrocarbon reserves and in the need to increase production and boost recovery from existing fields. North America Revenue of $5.34 billion increased marginally over 2006 primarily due to higher demand for Drilling & Measurements, Well Testing and Wireline activities in the US Land Central, US Land North and the US Gulf Coast GeoMarkets. However, this performance was offset by pricing erosion in well stimulation activities across the Area. Activity across US Land continued to grow driven by the increase in rig count and higher service intensity in unconventional natural gas reservoirs. However, weakness in natural gas prices and excess well stimulation related pressure pumping capacity led to a year-on-year decline in pricing in stimulation related activities. The US Gulf Coast GeoMarket continued to grow driven by demand for exploration related activities. In Canada year-on-year revenue declined sharply due to operator slowdown driven by weakness in natural gas prices and uncertainty over the fiscal regime. Pretax operating margin declined by 167 bps to 28.8% primarily due to lower pricing in well stimulation related activities across the Area together with lower activity in Canada. Latin America Revenue of $3.30 billion in 2007 increased 29% over 2006, led by a surge in IPM-related activity in Mexico following the budget-related slowdowns in the previous year, followed by the growth in exploration-related activities in the Peru/Columbia/Ecuador and Latin America South GeoMarkets. The Venezuela/Trinidad & Tobago GeoMarket also grew with higher rig count-driven activity in addition to finalization of the contracts related to drilling barges. 22 Table of Contents Part II, Item 7 The Mexico/Central America GeoMarket recorded robust growth with the start of several integrated projects. Peru/Columbia/Ecuador and Latin America South witnessed strong growth in exploration-related activities. Demand was strong for all Technologies led by IPM, followed by Drilling & Measurements, Wireline and Well Testing services. Pretax operating margin increased strongly by 358 bps to reach 22.9%. This increase resulted mainly from a favorable activity mix and improved pricing. Europe/CIS/Africa Revenue of $6.60 billion in 2007 increased 31% over 2006 with the highest growth recorded in the North Sea, West & South Africa and North Africa GeoMarkets. Strong revenue increases were recorded in the North Sea, West & South Africa and North Africa driven by the expansion of exploration-related activities. GeoMarkets in Russia continued to grow strongly due to a combination of organic growth and the completion of the acquisition of Tyumenpromgeofizika during the second quarter of the year. Pretax operating margins increased by 301 bps to reach 28.6%. This performance was due to a combination of increased activity, improved pricing and accelerated new technology deployment across most GeoMarkets partially offset by a pricing decline in well stimulation activities in the East Russia and subdued activity in Nigeria. Middle East & Asia Revenue of $4.87 billion in 2007 increased 31% over 2006 with the largest increases recorded in the Arabian GeoMarket, followed by East Mediterranean, Australia/Papua New Guinea, Qatar, Gulf and India. The Australia/Papua New Guinea GeoMarket recorded the highest growth rate in the Area driven by higher exploration related activity. Growth in East Mediterranean, Qatar, Gulf and India resulted from higher exploration and development activity while the Arabian GeoMarket continued to grow, albeit at a lower rate than the previous year, as new rig additions slowed down in Saudi Arabia. Pretax operating margin increased by 296 bps to an impressive 35.1%. This performance was driven by continued increase in activity and pricing increases together with deployment of higher-margin Wireline and Drilling & Measurements new technologies. WesternGeco Fourth Quarter 2008 Results Fourth-quarter revenue of $599 million decreased 33% sequentially and 25% year-on-year. Pretax operating income of $88 million was 75% lower sequentially and 68% lower year-on-year. Sequentially, Marine revenue decreased significantly due to seasonal vessel transits, dry docks and project startups. Multiclient revenue was also down markedly as customers reduced discretionary spending. Land revenue, however, increased due to higher utilization and the start of new projects in Latin America and Africa while Data Processing recorded modest growth. Pretax operating margin decreased sequentially from 39.8% to 14.7% due to lower Marine vessel utilization, higher transits and the slowdown in Multiclient sales, the effects of which were only partially offset by the higher Land crew utilization. Total Year 2008 Results Full-year 2008 revenue of $2.84 billion was 4% lower than 2007. Multiclient revenue was down 18%, primarily as the result of significantly lower client discretionary spending in the fourth quarter of 2008, while Land 23 Table of Contents Part II, Item 7 decreased 15% on lower crew utilization. These decreases were partially offset by a 4% revenue increase in Marine, as a result of additional vessel capacity and higher pricing, and a 19% increase in Data Processing, which experienced a growth in activity in all geographic areas. Pretax operating margin of 29.5% decreased 634 basis points due to significantly lower Multiclient sales, reduced Land activity and cost inflation that affected Marine operations. Revenue backlog was $1.8 billion at the end of 2008, compared to $1.2 billion at the end of 2007, of which an estimated $1.3 billion is expected to be realized in 2009. Total Year 2007 Results Full-year 2007 revenue of $2.96 billion increased 20% versus 2006. Pretax operating income of $1.06 billion in 2007 was 31% higher than 2006. Pretax operating margin reached 35.8% an increase of 299 bps in 2007 versus 2006 demonstrating continued high vessel utilization, pricing increases in Marine and accelerating demand for exploration-driven seismic services. Q-Technology revenue reached $1.14 billion, representing 38% of 2007 full-year revenue. Marine revenue grew 17% due mainly to strong activity in Asia, Middle East, India, Europe and North America as operators continued to focus on new exploration horizons. High vessel utilization, continued adoption of Q-Technology and improved pricing contributed to this performance. Multiclient revenue increased 30% driven by higher sales in North America as the demand for E-Dog and E-Cat surveys remained strong during the first half of the year augmented by strong demand for E-Octopus surveys during the second half. Data Processing revenue increased 26%, reflecting higher acquisition volumes, higher levels of Q processing, and higher activity in India, Asia, North Africa, Europe and the Caspian. Land revenue increased 6% with the continued adoption of Q-Land* technology in Africa and in the Middle East. During the second quarter of 2007, the seventh Q-Technology equipped vessel the Western Spirit was launched. Revenue backlog was $1.2 billion at the end of 2007 compared to $1.1 billion at the end of 2006. Interest and Other Income Interest and other income consisted of the following: (Stated in millions) 2008 2007 2006 Interest income $ 119 $ 162 $ 117 Equity in net earnings of affiliated companies 293 244 179 Other 1 (10 ) 25 (9 ) $ 402 $ 431 $ 287 1. Refer to Note 3 to the Consolidated Financial Statements for details. Interest Income The average return on investments decreased to 3.5% in 2008 from 5.2% in 2007 and the weighted average investment balance of $3.4 billion in 2008 increased $286 million compared to 2007. The average return on investments increased to 5.2% in 2007 from 4.5% in 2006 and the weighted average investment balance of $3.1 billion in 2007 increased $531 million compared to 2006. Equity in Net Earnings of Affiliated Companies The equity in net earnings of affiliated companies primarily represents Schlumberger share of the results of its 40% interest in the M-I SWACO drilling fluids joint venture with Smith International Inc. 24 Table of Contents Part II, Item 7 Interest Expense Interest expense of $247 million in 2008 decreased by $27 million compared to 2007 due to a decline in the weighted average borrowing rates, from 5.0% to 4.5%. The weighted average debt balance of $5.5 billion in 2008 was essentially flat compared to 2007 . Interest expense of $275 million in 2007 increased by $40 million compared to 2006. The weighted average borrowing rates of 5.0% in 2007 increased from 4.6% in 2006. The weighted average debt balance of $5.5 billion in 2007 increased by $420 million compared to 2006, primarily due to the funding, in the second quarter of 2006, of the WesternGeco transaction described in Note 4 to the Consolidated Financial Statements. Other Gross margin was 30.2%, 33.5% and 31.4% in 2008, 2007 and 2006, respectively. The decline in gross margin percentage in 2008, compared to 2007, was primarily attributable to the following factors: reduced pricing for well stimulation services in the US Land GeoMarkets, a higher mix of low-margin third-party managed services in the Mexico/Central America GeoMarket, significantly lower Multiclient sales in WesternGeco and the impact of cost inflation across all Areas within Oilfield Services as well as the Marine operations of WesternGeco. The increase in gross margin percentage in 2007, compared to 2006, was primarily due to increased pricing, stronger demand for higher-margin technologies, and operating efficiency improvements. As a percentage of Revenue, Research & engineering, Marketing and General & administrative expenses were as follows: 2008 2007 2006 Research & engineering 3.0 % 3.1 % 3.2 %* Marketing 0.4 % 0.4 % 0.4 % General & administrative 2.2 % 2.2 % 2.4 % * Research & engineering in 2006 included $27 million of in-process research and development charges associated with acquisitions. See discussion of the Charges and Credits in Note 3 to the Consolidated Financial Statements . Research & engineering expenditures, by segment, were as follows: (Stated in millions) 2008 2007 2006 Oilfield Services $ 686 $ 595 $ 496 WesternGeco 118 120 73 In-process R&D charges 1 27 Other 2 15 13 23 $ 819 $ 728 $ 619 1. See discussion of Charges and Credits in Note 3 to the Consolidated Financial Statements . 2. Includes $16 million of cost in 2006 associated with Schlumberger relocation of its United States research center from Ridgefield to Boston. Income Taxes The effective tax rate was 20.9% in 2008, 21.9% in 2007 and 24.0% in 2006. The Schlumberger effective tax rate is sensitive to the geographic mix of earnings. When the percentage of pretax earnings generated outside of North America increases, the Schlumberger effective tax rate will generally decrease. Conversely, when the percentage of pretax earnings generated outside of North America decreases, the Schlumberger effective tax rate will generally increase. 25 Table of Contents Part II, Item 7 The decrease in the effective tax rate in 2008, as compared to 2007, was primarily attributable to the geographic mix of earnings. Oilfield Services had a lower proportion of pretax earnings in North America. Also, outside North America, various GeoMarkets with lower tax rates contributed a greater percentage to pretax earnings. The decrease in the effective tax rate in 2007, as compared to 2006, was primarily attributable to the geographic mix of earnings. Both Oilfield Services and WesternGeco had a lower proportion of pretax earnings in North America. Outside North America, various GeoMarkets with lower tax rates contributed a greater percentage to pretax earnings.

Schlumberger entered into agreements to swap these Euro notes for US dollars on the date of issue until maturity, effectively making this a US dollar denominated debt on which Schlumberger Finance B.V. will pay interest in US dollars at a rate of 4.74%. The proceeds from these notes were used to repay commercial paper borrowings. On July 22, 2004, the Board of Directors of Schlumberger approved a share repurchase program of up to 30 million shares of common stock to be acquired in the open market before December 2006, subject to market conditions. This program was completed during the first quarter of 2006. On April 20, 2006, the Board of Directors of Schlumberger approved a share repurchase program of up to 40 million shares of common stock to be acquired in the open market before April 2010, subject to market conditions. This program was completed during the second quarter of 2008. On April 17, 2008, the Board of Directors of Schlumberger approved an $8 billion share repurchase program for shares of Schlumberger common stock to be acquired in the open market before December 31, 2011, of which $934 million has been repurchased as of December 31, 2008. 27 Table of Contents Part II, Item 7 The following table summarizes the activity under these share repurchase programs during 2008, 2007 and 2006: (Stated in thousands except per share amounts and prices) Total cost of shares purchased Total number of shares purchased Average price paid per share 2008 $ 1,818,841 21,064.7 $ 86.35 2007 $ 1,355,000 16,336.1 $ 82.95 2006 $ 1,067,842 17,992.7 $ 59.35 Given the current credit and economic environment, Schlumberger anticipates that the total dollar amount of stock repurchases in 2009 may be significantly less than the $1.8 billion spent during 2008. This anticipated reduction will serve to increase Schlumberger financial flexibility during these uncertain times. Stock buy-back activity during 2009 will continue to be targeted to offset any dilution caused by the Schlumberger stock-based compensation programs. Cash flow provided by operations was $6.9 billion in 2008, $6.3 billion in 2007 and $4.7 billion in 2006. These improvements were driven by the revenue and net income increases experienced in 2008 and 2007 offset by required investments in working capital. During 2008, 2007 and 2006, Schlumberger announced that its Board of Directors had approved increases in the quarterly dividend of 20%, 40% and 19%, respectively. Total dividends paid during 2008, 2007 and 2006 were $964 million, $771 million and $568 million, respectively. Capital expenditures were $3.7 billion in 2008, $2.9 billion in 2007 and $2.5 billion in 2006. These increases were a result of the increased activity levels experienced in recent years. Capital expenditures are expected to approach $3.0 billion in 2009, including $385 million relating to the construction of seismic vessels. During 2008, 2007 and 2006 Schlumberger made $290 million, $250 million and $251 million, respectively, of contributions to its defined benefit pension plans. The US qualified pension plan was 71% funded at December 31, 2008 based on the projected benefit obligation. This compares to 109% funded at December 31, 2007. Outside of the US, Schlumberger International Staff Pension Plan, which was converted to a defined benefit pension plan during the fourth quarter of 2008 (and therefore accounts for approximately half of the increase in the Postretirement Benefits liability on the Consolidated Balance Sheet at December 31, 2008), and UK pension plan are a combined 69% funded at December 31, 2008 based on the projected benefit obligation. The UK pension plan was 92% funded at December 31, 2007. Schlumberger currently anticipates contributing approximately $400 million to $500 million to its defined benefit pension plans in 2009, subject to market and business conditions. During 2008 and 2007, certain holders of Schlumberger Limited 1.5% Series A Convertible Debentures due June 1, 2023 and 2.125% Series B Convertible Debentures due June 1, 2023 converted their debentures into Schlumberger common stock. The following table summarizes these conversions: (Stated in millions) 2008 2007 Conversions Shares issued Conversions Shares issued 1.5% Series A debentures $ 353 9.76 $ 622 17.19 2.125% Series B debentures 95 2.36 34 0.85 $ 448 12.12 $ 656 18.04 28 Table of Contents Part II, Item 7 At December 31, 2008, there were no outstanding Series A debentures and there were $321 million outstanding Series B debentures. On December 10, 2007, Schlumberger completed the acquisition of Eastern Echo for $838 million in cash. Net assets acquired included $320 million of cash and investments and $182 million of long-term debt. On April 28, 2006, Schlumberger acquired the remaining 30% minority interest in WesternGeco from Baker Hughes Incorporated for $2.4 billion in cash. Approximately 50% of the purchase price was funded from Schlumberger cash and investments. The remaining 50% was financed through existing Schlumberger credit facilities. In September 2006, Schlumberger Finance B.V. issued 400 million Guaranteed Floating Rate Notes due 2009. Interest is payable quarterly at the rate of 10 basis points over 3-month Euribor. Schlumberger entered into an agreement to swap these Euro notes for US dollars on the date of issue until maturity, effectively making this US dollar denominated debt on which Schlumberger Finance B.V. will pay interest in US dollars at the rate of 3-month LIBOR plus 0.0875%. The proceeds from these notes were used to repay commercial paper borrowings. As of December 31, 2008, Schlumberger had approximately $3.7 billion of cash and short-term investments on hand. Wholly-owned subsidiaries of Schlumberger had separate committed debt facility agreements aggregating $3.9 billion with commercial banks, of which $1.8 billion was available and unused as of December 31, 2008. Schlumberger believes that these amounts are sufficient to meet future business requirements for at least the next twelve months. The current portion of long-term debt at December 31, 2008 has increased by $0.5 billion to $1.1 billion, as compared to December 31, 2007. This increase is primarily attributable to the outstanding 400 million Guaranteed Floating Rate Notes due 2009 being reclassified from long-term debt at December 21, 2008 to current at December 31, 2008 due to their maturity in the next twelve months. Schlumberger total outstanding debt at December 31, 2008 was $5.3 billion and included approximately $1.1 billion of commercial paper borrowings. The total outstanding debt decreased approximately $0.2 billion compared to December 31, 2007.

Excludes future payments for interest. Includes amounts relating to the $321 million of Convertible Debentures which are described in Note 11 of the Consolidated Financial Statements . 2. Represents an estimate of contractual obligations in the ordinary course of business. Although these contractual obligations are considered enforceable and legally binding, the terms generally allow Schlumberger the option to reschedule and adjust their requirements based on business needs prior to the delivery of goods. Refer to Note 19 of the Consolidated Financial Statements for details regarding Schlumberger pension and other postretirement benefit obligations. 29 Table of Contents Part II, Item 7 As discussed in Note 15 of the Consolidated Financial Statements , included in the Schlumberger Consolidated Balance Sheet at December 31, 2008 is approximately $877 million of liabilities associated with uncertain tax positions in the over 100 jurisdictions in which Schlumberger conducts business. Due to the uncertain and complex application of tax regulations, combined with the difficulty in predicting when tax audits throughout the world may be concluded, Schlumberger cannot make reliable estimates of the timing of cash outflows relating to these liabilities. Schlumberger has outstanding letters of credit/guarantees which relate to business performance bonds, custom/excise tax commitments, facility lease/rental obligations, etc. These were entered into in the ordinary course of business and are customary practices in the various countries where Schlumberger operates. Critical Accounting Policies and Estimates The preparation of financial statements and related disclosures in conformity with accounting principles generally accepted in the United States requires Schlumberger to make estimates and assumptions that affect the reported amounts of assets and liabilities, the disclosure of contingent assets and liabilities and the reported amounts of revenue and expenses. The following accounting policies involve critical accounting estimates because they are particularly dependent on estimates and assumptions made by Schlumberger about matters that are inherently uncertain. A summary of all of Schlumberger significant accounting policies is included in Note 2 to the Consolidated Financial Statements . Schlumberger bases its estimates on historical experience and on various assumptions that are believed to be reasonable under the circumstances, the results of which form the basis for making judgments about the carrying values of assets and liabilities that are not readily apparent from other sources. Actual results may differ from these estimates under different assumptions or conditions. Multiclient Seismic Data The WesternGeco segment capitalizes the costs associated with obtaining multiclient seismic data. The carrying value of the multiclient seismic data library at December 31, 2008 and 2007 was $287 million and $182 million, respectively. Such costs are charged to Cost of goods sold and services based on the percentage of the total costs to the estimated total revenue that Schlumberger expects to receive from the sales of such data. However, under no circumstances will an individual survey carry a net book value greater than a 4-year straight-line amortized value. The carrying value of surveys is reviewed for impairment annually as well as when an event or change in circumstance indicates an impairment may have occurred. Adjustments to the carrying value are recorded when it is determined that estimated future revenues, which involve significant judgment on the part of Schlumberger, would not be sufficient to recover the carrying value of the surveys. Significant adverse changes in Schlumberger estimated future cash flows could result in impairment charges in a future period. For purposes of performing the annual impairment test of the multiclient library, future cash flows are analyzed primarily based on two pools of surveys: United States and non-United States. The United States and non-United States pools were determined to be the most appropriate level at which to perform the impairment review based upon a number of factors including (i) various macroeconomic factors that influence the ability to successfully market surveys and (ii) the focus of the sales force and related costs. Certain larger surveys are analyzed for impairment on a survey by survey basis. These surveys are typically significantly prefunded by customers and accordingly, management has determined that it is not appropriate to include them within the United States and non-United States pools for impairment review purposes. 30 Table of Contents Part II, Item 7 Allowance for Doubtful Accounts Schlumberger maintains an allowance for doubtful accounts in order to record accounts receivable at their net realizable value. A significant amount of judgment is involved in recording and making adjustments to this reserve. Allowances have been recorded for receivables believed to be uncollectible, including amounts for the resolution of potential credit and other collection issues such as disputed invoices. Depending on how such potential issues are resolved, or if the financial condition of Schlumberger customers were to deteriorate resulting in an impairment of their ability to make payments, adjustments to the allowance may be required. Goodwill, Intangible Assets and Long-Lived Assets Schlumberger records as goodwill the excess of purchase price over the fair value of the tangible and identifiable intangible assets acquired. Statement of Financial Accounting Standards No. 142, Goodwill and Other Intangible Assets (SFAS 142), requires goodwill to be tested for impairment annually as well as when an event or change in circumstance indicates an impairment may have occurred. Goodwill is tested for impairment by comparing the fair value of Schlumberger individual reporting units to their carrying amount to determine if there is a potential goodwill impairment. If the fair value of the reporting unit is less than its carrying value, an impairment loss is recorded to the extent that the implied fair value of the goodwill of the reporting unit is less than its carrying value. For purposes of performing the impairment test for goodwill as required by SFAS 142, Schlumberger reporting units are primarily the geographic areas comprising the Oilfield Services segment in addition to the WesternGeco segment. Schlumberger estimates the fair value of these reporting units using a discounted cash flow analysis and/or applying various market multiples. Determining the fair value of a reporting unit is a matter of judgment and often involves the use of significant estimates and assumptions. Schlumberger estimates of the fair value of each of its reporting units were significantly in excess of their respective carrying values at the time of the annual goodwill impairment tests for 2008, 2007 and 2006. Long-lived assets, including fixed assets and intangible assets, are reviewed for impairment whenever events or changes in circumstances indicate that the carrying value may not be recoverable. In reviewing for impairment, the carrying value of such assets is compared to the estimated undiscounted future cash flows expected from the use of the assets and their eventual disposition. If such cash flows are not sufficient to support the asset recorded value, an impairment charge is recognized to reduce the carrying value of the long-lived asset to its estimated fair value. The determination of future cash flows as well as the estimated fair value of long-lived assets involves significant estimates on the part of management. If there is a material change in economic conditions or other circumstances influencing the estimate of future cash flows or fair value, Schlumberger could be required to recognize impairment charges in the future. Schlumberger evaluates the remaining useful life of its intangible assets on a periodic basis to determine whether events and circumstances warrant a revision to the remaining estimated amortization period. Income Taxes Schlumberger tax filings are subject to regular audit by the tax authorities in most of the over 100 jurisdictions in which it conducts business. These audits may result in assessments for additional taxes which are resolved with the authorities or, potentially, through the courts. Tax liabilities are recorded based on estimates of additional taxes which will be due upon the conclusion of these audits. Estimates of these tax liabilities are made based upon prior experience and are updated in light of changes in facts and circumstances. However, due to the uncertain and complex application of tax regulations, it is possible that the ultimate resolution of audits may result in liabilities which could be materially different from these estimates. In such an event, Schlumberger will record additional tax expense or tax benefit in the period in which such resolution occurs. 31 Table of Contents Part II, Item 7 Pension and Postretirement Benefits Schlumberger pension and postretirement benefit obligations are described in detail in Note 19 to the Consolidated Financial Statements . The obligations and related costs are calculated using actuarial concepts, which include critical assumptions related to the discount rate, expected return on plan assets and medical cost trend rates. These assumptions are important elements of expense and/or liability measurement and are updated on an annual basis, or upon the occurrence of significant events. The discount rate Schlumberger uses reflects the prevailing market rate of a portfolio of high-quality debt instruments with maturities matching the expected timing of the payment of the benefit obligations. The following summarizes the discount rates utilized by Schlumberger for its various pension and postretirement benefit plans: The discount rate utilized to determine the liability for Schlumberger United States pension plans and postretirement medical plans was 6.50% at both December 31, 2008 and December 31, 2007. The weighted-average discount rate utilized to determine the liability for Schlumberger international pension plans was 6.48% at December 31, 2008 and 5.80% at December 31, 2007. The discount rate utilized to determine expense for Schlumberger United States pension plans and postretirement medical plans was increased from 6.00% in 2007 to 6.50% in 2008. The weighted-average discount rate utilized to determine expense for Schlumberger international pension plans was increased from 5.20% in 2007 to 5.80% in 2008. A higher discount rate decreases the present value of benefit obligations and decreases expense. The expected rate of return for our retirement benefit plans represents the average rate of return expected to be earned on plan assets over the period that benefits included in the benefit obligation, are expected to be paid. The expected rate of return for Schlumberger United States pension plans has been determined based upon expectations regarding future rates of return for the investment portfolio, with consideration given to the distribution of investments by asset class and historical rates of return for each individual asset class. The expected rate of return on plan assets for the United States pension plans was 8.50% in 2008 and 2007. The expected rate of return on plan assets for the international plans was 8.00% in 2008 and 2007. A lower expected rate of return would increase pension expense. Schlumberger medical cost trend rate assumptions are developed based on historical cost data, the near-term outlook and an assessment of likely long-term trends. The overall medical cost trend rate assumption utilized in both 2008 and 2007 was 9% graded to 6% over the next four years and 5% thereafter. The following illustrates the sensitivity to changes in certain assumptions, holding all other assumptions constant, for the United States and international pension plans: (Stated in millions) Change in Assumption Effect on 2008 Pretax Pension Expense Effect on Dec. 31, 2008 Liability 25 basis point decrease in discount rate +$15 +$181 25 basis point increase in discount rate - $14 - $172 25 basis point decrease in expected return on plan assets +$ 7 25 basis point increase in expected return on plan assets - $ 7 32 Table of Contents Part II, Item 7, 7A The following illustrates the sensitivity to changes in certain assumptions, holding all other assumptions constant, for Schlumberger United States postretirement medical plans: (Stated in millions) Change in Assumption Effect on 2008 Pretax Postretirement Medical Expense Effect on Dec. 31, 2008 Liability 25 basis point decrease in discount rate +$ 3 +$ 30 25 basis point increase in discount rate - $ 3 - $ 32 100 basis point decrease per annum in medical cost trend rate - $19 - $109 100 basis point increase per annum in medical cost trend rate +$23 +$127
