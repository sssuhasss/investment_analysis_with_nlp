ITEM 7. MANAGEMENT S DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS OF FINANCIAL CONDITION AND RESULTS OF OPERATIONS Executive Summary Our operating results for 2004 marked another year of growth with total revenues reaching $1.32 billion and higher ending cash, cash equivalents and marketable securities of $1.25 billion, driven in large part by operating cash flows of $511.4 million for the year. Although several factors contributed to our improved financial performance over 2003, two important drivers were the continued growth experienced by our HIV products portfolio (which is comprised of Viread, Emtriva and Truvada), as well as the maintenance of AmBisome revenues amidst increasing competition. Given increased international sales and a favorable foreign currency environment in Europe, Viread sales increased 38% year over year and comprised 63% of 2004 total product sales. In August 2004, we launched Truvada, which is the co-formulation of Viread and Emtriva, in the United States. We began launching Truvada in the European Union following regulatory approval in February 2005. Over time, depending on the treatment regimens prescribed by physicians, we expect to see Truvada sales partially replace product sales of Viread and Emtriva. To further increase our future sales of HIV products, we entered into a joint venture collaboration agreement with BMS in December 2004 to develop and commercialize the fixed-dose combination of Gilead Truvada and BMS Sustiva in the United States. Understanding the importance of having a clear view of our wholesalers channel inventory, we signed inventory management agreements with our three major U.S. wholesalers in 2004. In keeping with our strategy of active product acquisition and in-licensing, we rounded out 2004 by entering into collaboration agreements in the area of HCV. Our operating results for 2003 were impacted by the acquisition of all of the assets of Triangle i n January 2003. We completed this acquisition to expand our antiviral pipeline. Triangle was a development stage company with a particular focus on potential therapies for HIV, including AIDS, and HBV. The aggregate purchase price was $525.2 million and included cash paid of $463.1 million, the fair value of stock options assumed of $41.3 million, direct transaction costs of $14.2 million and employee related costs of $6.6 million. Approximately $488.6 million of the consideration paid was allocated to purchased in-process research and development and represented the fair value of Triangle incomplete research and development programs that had not yet reached technological feasibility and had no alternative future use as of the acquisition date. As a result of this transaction and the related purchased in-process research and development charge, our operating loss for 2003 was $158.7 million. This acquisition was important to us not only for the compounds we acquired, but also for the opportunity it provided us to create Truvada, our co-formulation of Viread and Emtriva, into a single pill that can be dosed once a day. See Note 3 to the consolidated financial statements for further information on the Triangle acquisition. On September 3, 2004, Gilead completed a two-for-one stock split, effected in the form of a stock dividend, to stockholders of record as of August 12, 2004. Accordingly, all share and per share amounts for all periods presented have been restated to reflect this stock split. In addition, certain prior year amounts have also been reclassified to conform to the current year presentation. Management discussion and analysis should be read in conjunction with the consolidated financial statements and notes included elsewhere in this report. Forward-Looking Statements and Risk Factors The following discussion contains forward-looking statements that involve risks and uncertainties. The Risk Factors discussion should be read in conjunction with the consolidated financial statements and notes included elsewhere in this report. 28 Critical Accounting Policies, Estimates and Judgments This discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations is based upon our consolidated financial statements, which have been prepared in accordance with accounting principles generally accepted in the United States. The preparation of these financial statements requires us to make estimates and judgments that affect the reported amounts of assets, liabilities, revenues and expenses, and related disclosures. On an on-going basis, we evaluate our estimates, including those related to revenue recognition, allowance for doubtful accounts, inventories, clinical trial accruals and our tax provision. We base our estimates on historical experience and on various other market-specific assumptions that are believed to be reasonable under the circumstances, the results of which form the basis for making judgments about the carrying values of assets and liabilities that are not readily apparent from other sources. Actual results, however, may differ significantly from these estimates. We believe the following critical accounting policies reflect the more significant judgments and estimates used in the preparation of our consolidated financial statements: Revenue Recognition We recognize revenue from product sales when there is persuasive evidence an arrangement exists, delivery to the customer has occurred, the price is fixed or determinable and collectibility is reasonably assured. We record estimated reductions to revenue for expected returns of expired products, distributor fees, government rebate programs, such as Medicaid reimbursements and customer incentives, such as cash discounts for prompt payment. Estimates for distributor fees are based on contractually determined fixed percentages of sales. Estimates for government rebate programs and cash discounts are based on contractual terms, historical utilization rates and expectations regarding future utilization rates for these programs. Estimates for product returns, including new products, are based on an on-going analysis of industry and historical return patterns. This includes monitoring the feedback that we receive from our sales force regarding customer use and satisfaction, reviewing inventory data available to us through our U.S. wholesaler inventory management agreements to assist us in monitoring channel inventory levels, the purchase of third-party data to monitor prescriptions as well as, for new products, a review of our other long shelf life products we have sold through the same or similar channels. Further, we monitor the activities and clinical trials of our key competitors and assess the potential impact on our future sales and return expectations where necessary. Expected returns for our marketed drugs are generally low because the shelf life for these products ranges from 24 months for Truvada and up to 36 months for AmBisome and Viread in the United States. If conditions become more competitive for any of the markets served by our drugs or if other circumstances change, we may take actions to increase our product return estimates or we may offer additional customer incentives. This would result in an incremental reduction of future revenue at the time the return estimate is changed or new incentives are offered. Contract revenue for research and development is recorded as performance occurs and the earnings process is completed based on the performance requirements of the contract. Nonrefundable contract fees for which no further performance obligations exist, and where there is no continuing involvement by Gilead, are recognized on the earlier of when the payments are received or when collection is reasonably assured. Revenue from non-refundable up-front license fees and milestone payments where we continue to have involvement such as through a development collaboration or an obligation to supply product is recognized as performance occurs and our obligations are completed. In accordance with the specific terms of Gilead obligations under these types of arrangements, revenue is recognized as the manufacturing obligation is fulfilled or ratably over the development period. Revenue associated with substantive at-risk milestones is recognized based upon the achievement of the milestones as defined in the 29 respective agreements. Advance payments received in excess of amounts earned are classified as deferred revenue. Allowance for Doubtful Accounts We also maintain an allowance for doubtful accounts for estimated losses resulting from the inability of our customers to make required payments. This allowance is based on our analysis of several factors including, but not limited to, contractual payment terms, historical payment patterns of our customers and individual customer circumstances, an analysis of days sales outstanding by customer and geographic region, and a review of the local economic environment and its potential impact on government funding and reimbursement practices. If the financial condition of our customers or the economic environment in which they operate were to deteriorate, resulting in an inability to make payments, additional allowances may be required. Our allowance for doubtful accounts balance as a percentage of total accounts receivable did not materially change from December 31, 2003 to December 31, 2004. We believe that the allowance for doubtful accounts is adequate to cover anticipated losses under current conditions; however, significant deterioration in any of the above factors, especially with respect to the government funding and reimbursement practices in the European market could materially change these expectations and result in an increase to our allowance for doubtful accounts. Inventories We write down our inventory based on historical review of the quantity of bad batches experienced during the manufacturing process and expectations of production and inventory levels. We also perform quality control reviews of our individual raw material batches. We generally do not record inventory write-offs based on estimated obsolescence or risk of competition primarily because the shelf life of our products is long. However, if our current assumptions about future production or inventory levels, demand or competition were to change or if actual market conditions are less favorable than those projected by management, inventory write-downs may be required which could negatively impact our product gross margins and results of operations. Clinical Trial Accruals We record accruals for estimated clinical and preclinical study costs. Most of our clinical and preclinical studies are performed by third party contract research organizations (CROs). These costs are a significant component of research and development expenses. During 2004, 2003 and 2002, we incurred $24.7 million, $15.0 million and $23.9 million, respectively, of CRO costs. We accrue costs for clinical studies performed by CROs on a straight-line basis over the term of the service period and adjust our estimates, if required, based upon our on-going review of the level of effort actually incurred by the CRO. Initially we estimate that the work performed under the contracts occurs ratably over the periods to the expected milestone, event or total contract completion date. The expected completion dates are estimated based upon the terms of the contracts and past experience with similar contracts. These estimates may or may not match the actual services performed by the organizations as determined by patient enrollment levels and other measures of activities specified in the contract. As a result, we validate our accruals quarterly through written vendor confirmations and detailed reviews of the activities performed for our significant contracts. Based upon the results of these validation processes, we assess the appropriateness of our accruals and make any adjustments we deem necessary to ensure that our expenses reflect the actual effort incurred by the CROs. Generally, a significant portion of the total costs are associated with start up activities for the trial and patient enrollment. Gilead extensively outsources its clinical trial activities and usually performs only a small portion of the start-up activities in-house. As a result, CROs typically perform most of the total start-up activities for our trials, including document preparation, site identification, screening and preparation, pre-study visits, training and program management. On a 30 budgeted basis, these costs are typically 20% to 30% of the total contract value. On an actual basis, this percentage range is significantly wider as many of our contracts are either expanded or reduced in scope compared to the original budget while the start-up costs for the particular trial do not change significantly. Start-up costs usually occur within a few months after the contract has been established and are milestone or event driven in nature. The remaining activities and related costs, such as patient monitoring and administration, generally occur ratably throughout the life of the individual contract or study. Most contracts are negotiated as fixed unit prices and can vary in length between six months for a single dose Phase 1 study and up to two years or more for a more complex Phase 3 study. The average length of contract in 2004, 2003 and 2002 has been at the upper end of this range in order to provide long term safety and efficacy data to support the commercial launches of Viread, Truvada, Hepsera and Emtriva. Through December 31, 2004, differences between actual and estimated activity levels for any particular study were not significant enough to require a material adjustment. All of our material CRO contracts are terminable by us upon written notice and Gilead is generally only liable for actual effort expended by the CRO at any point in time during the contract, regardless of payment status. Amounts paid in advance of services being performed will be refunded if a contract is terminated. However, if management does not receive complete and accurate information from our vendors or has underestimated activity levels associated with a study at a given point in time, we would have to record additional and potentially significant research and development expenses in future periods. Tax Provision We develop our income tax provision including deferred tax assets and liabilities, based on significant management judgment. We evaluate the realizibility of our deferred tax assets on a quarterly basis. We record a valuation allowance to reduce our deferred tax assets to the amounts that are likely to be realized. We consider future taxable income, ongoing tax planning strategies and our historical financial performance in assessing the need for a valuation allowance. If we expect to realize deferred tax assets for which we have previously recorded a valuation allowance, we would reduce the valuation allowance in the period in which such determination is first made. Such an adjustment was made in the fourth quarter of 2003 and 2004 when we determined that it was more likely than not that certain of our deferred tax assets would be realized, and therefore, we released the related valuation allowance. This resulted in an income tax benefit for 2003 and 2004 of approximately $111.6 million and $14.2 million, respectively. Similarly, if we determine that we would not be able to realize all or part of our deferred tax assets for which we have no valuation allowance, we would increase the valuation allowance in the period in which such determination is first made. Our future effective income tax rate may be affected by such factors as changes in tax laws or rates, changes in the interpretation of these laws, the impact of accounting for employee stock options beginning in the second half of 2005, and overall changes in future levels of earnings and research and development and capital spending. Management has discussed the development and selection of these critical accounting policies with the Audit Committee of Gilead Board of Directors and the Audit Committee has reviewed the disclosure presented above relating to them. Results of Operations Total Revenues We had total revenue of $1.32 billion in 2004, $867.9 million in 2003 and $466.8 million in 2002. Included in total revenue are product sales, royalty revenue and contract revenue includes revenue earned from research and development (R&D) and manufacturing collaborations. 31 Product Sales Product sales consisted of the following (in thousands): 2004 Change 2003 Change 2002 Viread $ 782,915 38 % $ 566,478 151 % $ 225,815 Emtriva 57,600 475 % 10,021 Truvada 67,865 Total HIV products 908,380 58 % 576,499 155 % 225,815 AmBisome 211,688 7 % 198,350 7 % 185,669 Other 122,156 99 % 61,492 396 % 12,395 Total product sales $ 1,242,224 49 % $ 836,341 97 % $ 423,879 Product sales increased 49% in 2004 compared to 2003 and 97% in 2003 compared to 2002, due primarily to the increase in the volume of sales within our HIV products. A significant percentage of our product sales continue to be denominated in foreign currencies. We use forward contracts to hedge a percentage of our forecasted international sales, primarily those denominated in the Euro. This reduces, but does not eliminate, fluctuations in sales due to changes in foreign currency exchange rates. Losses on these revenue hedges reduced increases in product sales by $2.5 million in 2004, $2.8 million in 2003 and $1.0 million in 2002, due to fluctuations in exchange rates. However, product sales (mainly Viread and AmBisome) benefitted overall, primarily from the increases in the exchange rates for the Euro and the British Pound in comparison with the U.S. dollar: $43.7 million when comparing 2004 to 2003 and $43.6 million when comparing 2003 to 2002. Prior to 2004, we experienced significant fluctuations in U.S. distribution channel inventory levels due to speculative purchasing by the major wholesalers. As a result, we experienced increased quarter over quarter sales volatility from these purchasing patterns. In order to help alleviate these fluctuations, i n July 2004, we entered into inventory management agreements (IMAs) with AmerisourceBergen Drug Corporation, Cardinal Health, Inc. and McKesson Corporation, three major pharmaceutical wholesalers that distribute more than 90 percent of the portfolio of products that we sell in the United States. These agreements were implemented to limit speculative buying and to help ensure that wholesaler purchasing is more consistent with customer demand and more predictable. Under these agreements, we agreed to pay the wholesalers a fee in exchange for product distribution and inventory management services, market research information, return goods processing assistance and counterfeit product detection services. Such fees are recorded as a reduction to product sales in the consolidated statements of operations. Additionally, under the terms of the agreements, each wholesaler has agreed not to exceed specified maximum levels of inventory on hand. As of the end of December 2004, we believe that these three major wholesalers have inventories on-hand for all Gilead products of less than one month supply, which is in compliance with the contractually specified levels. Viread, Emtriva and Truvada were approved for sale in the United States in October 2001, July 2003 and August 2004, respectively. Viread and Emtriva were approved for sale in the European Union in February 2002 and October 2003, respectively. Sales of Viread were 63%, 68% and 53% of total product sales in 2004, 2003 and 2002, respectively. Of the Viread sales in 2004, $437.5 million were U.S. sales, an increase of 23% versus 2003, and $345.4 million were international sales, an increase of 64% versus 2003. Of the Viread sales in 2003, $355.9 million were U.S. sales, an increase of 113% versus 2002, and $210.6 million were international sales, an increase of 258% versus 2002. Since Emtriva introduction in July 2003, sales increased significantly from $10.0 million in 2003 to $57.6 million in 2004. Also, since August 2004 when Truvada was approved for sale in the United States, product sales have totaled $67.9 million through December 31, 2004. Total HIV product sales in 2004 were $27.4 million higher compared to 2003 due to the favorable European currency environment, the majority of which relates to 32 Viread sales. We believe that as our product sales mix changes with patients who are currently taking Viread and/or Emtriva switching to Truvada, looking at our HIV products sales collectively is a more relevant basis for period-over-period comparison. Sales of HIV products as a percentage of total product sales were 73%, 69% and 53% for 2004, 2003 and 2002, respectively. In 2005, we expect sales from our HIV products to be $1.2 billion to $1.25 billion for the full year. Sales of AmBisome were 17%, 24% and 44% of total product sales in 2004, 2003 and 2002, respectively. As our HIV and HBV product sales continue to increase, AmBisome sales are decreasing as a percentage of total product sales. Of the AmBisome sales in 2004, $11.4 million were U.S. sales, a decrease of 17% versus 2003, and $200.3 million were international sales, an increase of 9% versus 2003. Of the AmBisome sales in 2003, $13.8 million were U.S. sales, a decrease of 10% versus 2002, and $184.6 million were international sales, an increase of 8% over 2002. Reported AmBisome sales for 2004 were $16.3 million higher due to the favorable currency environment compared to 2003. On a volume basis, AmBisome sales in the United States decreased 2% from 2003 while sales volume in Europe increased slightly by 1% compared to 2003. When analyzing the decrease in U.S. sales, it is important to note that while U.S. product sales decreased 17% when comparing 2004 to 2003, volume decreased only 2%. Our discussion of U.S. AmBisome sales relates solely to our sales of AmBisome to Fujisawa which is recorded at our manufacturing cost. In 2004, due to greater manufacturing efficiencies, our per unit manufacturing cost for AmBisome decreased, thereby decreasing revenues reported for our sales to Fujisawa. Royalties that we earn on sales of AmBisome by Fujisawa are discussed below. With continuing competition, we expect AmBisome sales for 2005 to be in the range of $195 million to $205 million. Royalty Revenue We recorded royalty revenues of $63.4 million in 2004, compared with $25.2 million in 2003 and $20.4 million in 2002. During this three-year period, our most significant source of royalty revenue resulted from sales of Tamiflu by Roche and sales of AmBisome in the United States by Fujisawa under a co-promotion arrangement with us. Royalty revenues earned on sales of Tamiflu were $44.6 million, $12.0 million and $3.4 million in 2004, 2003 and 2002, respectively. Royalty revenues earned on sales of AmBisome by Fujisawa were $13.0 million, $12.5 million and $15.7 million in 2004, 2003 and 2002, respectively. As it is difficult to estimate third party product sales, we record royalty revenue from Roche one quarter in arrears. Due to a severe influenza epidemic in the United States in late 2003 through early 2004, our royalty revenues increased substantially during the first and second quarters of 2004. Increased awareness and discussion about the supply of influenza treatments in 2004 has further increased Roche sales of Tamiflu and consequently, our royalties for the third and fourth quarters of 2004. Contract Revenue Total contract revenue was $19.0 million in 2004, compared with $6.3 million in 2003 and $22.5 million in 2002. In 2004, contract revenue consisted primarily of $10.0 million in research and milestone revenue earned from Eyetech Pharmaceuticals which included $7.6 million net milestone payments earned upon the filing of new drug applications by Eyetech in Europe and the United States for Macugen (pegaptanib sodium injection). In 2003, the primary source of contract revenue consisted of $2.2 million in license fees earned in conjunction with our licensing agreement with Eyetech for Macugen. In 2002, contract revenue primarily consisted of $8.1 million due to our licensing of the SELEX process patent estate to Archemix, which, due to collectibility concerns, we recognized on a cash basis, and $8.0 million in milestone payments from Roche for the European prophylaxis and treatment approvals of Tamiflu. In December 2001, we completed the sale of our oncology assets to OSI. Under the terms our agreement, we are entitled to additional payments from OSI of up to $30.0 million in either cash or a combination of cash and OSI stock if and when OSI reaches certain development milestones for NX 211, the most advanced of the oncology product candidates sold to OSI. Under a related manufacturing 33 agreement, we produce NX 211 and GS 7904L, the two liposomal products included in the sales at our manufacturing facility in San Dimas, California. In 2004, 2003 and 2002, we recognized $1.4 million, $1.1 million and $3.3 million, respectively, of contract revenue under this manufacturing agreement. Cost of Goods Sold and Product Gross Margins The following table indicates cost of goods sold and product gross margins (in thousands): 2004 Change 2003 Change 2002 Total product sales $ 1,242,224 49 % $ 836,341 97 % $ 423,879 Cost of goods sold $ 166,587 48 % $ 112,691 62 % $ 69,724 Gross margin percentage 86.6 % 86.5 % 83.6 % Our gross margin was relatively flat from 2003 to 2004 as the positive impact of improvements in certain manufacturing processes and a favorable foreign currency environment was offset by changes in product sales mix. Comparing 2003 to 2002, gross margin improved primarily due to a change in product mix as Viread, a higher margin product, contributed more significantly to net product sales in 2003. Changes in foreign currency exchange rates impact gross margins since we price our products in the currency of the country into which the products are sold while a significant majority of our manufacturing costs are in U.S. dollars. For example, an increase in the value of these foreign currencies relative to the U.S. dollar will positively impact gross margins since our manufacturing costs will remain approximately the same while our revenues after being translated into U.S. dollars, will increase. Although the weakening U.S. dollar has positively impacted gross revenues and gross margins in 2004, 2003 and 2002, the full effect of the foreign currency exchange rates has been moderated by our hedging program on forecasted international sales. Except for the potential impact of unpredictable and uncontrollable changes in exchange rates relative to the U.S. dollar and the mix of product sales between our various HIV products, Hepsera and AmBisome, we expect gross margins in 2005 to be consistent with those of 2004, within the range of 85-86%. Research and Development Expenses The following table summarizes our research and development expenses into these major components (in thousands): 2004 Change 2003 Change 2002 Research $ 43,872 17 % $ 37,494 35 % $ 27,847 Clinical development 146,983 37 % 107,438 20 % 89,379 Pharmaceutical development 32,697 (11 )% 36,832 49 % 24,641 Total $ 223,552 23 % $ 181,764 28 % $ 141,867 34 The three major categories of research and development (R&D) expenses consist of personnel costs, including salaries and benefits, clinical studies performed by contract research organizations, materials and supplies, and overhead allocations consisting of various support and facilities related costs. Research costs typically consist of preclinical and toxicology work. Clinical development costs include Phase 1, 2, 3 and 4 clinical trials as well as expanded access programs. Pharmaceutical development costs consist of product formulation and chemical analysis. Prior to 2004, clinical development consisted only of clinical trial expenses for Phases 1 through 3 and Phase 4 in the United States. Phase 4 European clinical trials were included in sales, general and administrative (SG&A). During 2004, in order to better reflect the nature of the European Phase 4 clinical trials, we began recording these clinical trial expenses as research and development. In order to be consistent with the current year presentation, $16.9 million and $7.1 million of expenses were reclassified from selling, general and administrative to research and development expenses for the years ended December 31, 2003 and 2002, respectively. The $41.8 million increase in R&D expenses in 2004 over 2003 was primarily attributable to increased salaries of $10.2 million due largely to higher headcount, increased contract research organization costs of $9.7 million associated with increased clinical activities, as well as $13.0 million research and license fees paid by us in relation to hepatitis C collaboration agreements effective in the fourth quarter of 2004. The new 2004 collaborations were entered into with Achillion and Genelabs and required us to pay aggregate license fees of $13.0 million which were expensed as R&D as the underlying technology had no alternative future use. The increase in 2004 R&D activity was partially offset by a decrease in spending due to the discontinuation of our two programs, GS 9005 and GS 7340, that focused on the development of certain HIV investigational products. It is also important to note that our 2003 R&D expenses included a reimbursement to Gilead of $13.2 million from the settlement of a contractual dispute with a vendor. T he $39.9 million increase in R&D spending in 2003 versus 2002 was primarily attributable to increased salaries of $14.4 million due largely to higher headcount, increased clinical supplies costs of $7.0 million and increased clinical trials costs associated with the development of Emtriva and Truvada, the co-formulation of Viread and Emtriva. Also as mentioned above, in 2003, we settled a contractual dispute with a vendor that resulted in reimbursement to us of $13.2 million that was recorded to research and development expense. In 2005, we expect R&D expenses to be approximately $240 million to $260 million. This estimated increase in expenses over 2004 levels reflects increased spending on our internal research and development efforts as well as costs associated with post-marketing studies to support our products, but excludes any expenses we may incur associated with potential collaborations or strategic acquisitions, including license and milestone fees or cost sharing arrangements, and the impact of accounting for employee stock based compensation beginning in the second half of 2005. Industry reports indicate that a biopharmaceutical company generally takes 10 to 15 years (an average of 12 years) to research, develop and bring to market a new prescription medicine in the United States. These averages are generally consistent with the projects that we undertake internally, although our recent product development timelines have been on a slightly more accelerated basis. Drug development in the United States is a process that includes several steps defined by the FDA. The process begins with the filing of an IND, which, if successful, allows opportunity for clinical study of the potential new medicine. Clinical development typically involves three phases of study: Phase 1, 2 and 3, and generally accounts for an average of seven years of a drug total development time. The most significant costs associated with clinical development are the Phase 3 trials as they tend to be the longest and largest studies conducted during the drug development process. We currently have products in development that are in Phase 3 studies. The successful development of our products is highly uncertain. Completion dates and R&D expenses can vary significantly for each product and are difficult to predict. Even after successful development and FDA approval of a product, we undertake additional studies to try to expand the product label and market potential. For a more complete discussion of the risks and uncertainties 35 associated with completing the development of products, see the Risk Factors That Affect Gilead section of Item I above. Selling, General and Administrative Expenses The following table highlights the year to year changes in selling, general and administrative expenses (in thousands): 2004 Change 2003 Change 2002 Selling, general and administrative $ 302,793 30 % $ 233,266 34 % $ 174,192 SG&A expenses for the year ended December 31, 2004 were $302.8 million compared to $233.3 million for the year ended December 31, 2003, which includes the reclassification of phase IV clinical trial expenses incurred in 2003 to R&D of $16.9 million. The significant increase in expenses in 2004 compared to 2003 is primarily due to increased salaries of $14.2 million due largely to higher headcount, increased consulting fees of $5.9 million related to Sarbanes-Oxley compliance and business strategy consulting, as well as increased costs of $12.6 million relating to speaker programs, grants and journal advertising. The remainder of the increase in SG&A expenses in 2004 compared to 2003 is due to our increased global marketing efforts and increased infrastructure required to support the growth of our business. During 2004, as part of our infrastructure investments, we implemented a reorganization of our sales and marketing functions into a newly created commercial division. In conjunction with this reorganization, we created and filled the new position of executive vice-president, commercial operations who will have responsibility over global commercial operations and strategy for our product portfolio. The increase in expenses in 2003 compared to 2002, which includes the reclassification of phase IV clinical trial expenses to R&D of $7.1 million, is primarily due to increased salaries of $13.4 million due largely to higher headcount, an increase in hedging costs of $10.6 million, increased costs of $9.0 million relating to marketing meetings and grants, as well as increased general and directors and officers insurance of $6.4 million. The remainder of the increase in SG&A expenses is due to our global sales and marketing efforts including the expansion of our U.S. and European sales forces and increased infrastructure required to support the growth of our business. In 2005, we expect SG&A expenses to be approximately $350 million to $370 million primarily due to the anticipated launch costs for Truvada in the European Union, as well as ongoing investment in our global commercial organization through hiring and promotional programs, but excludes any expenses we may incur associated with potential collaborations or strategic acquisitions and the impact of applying the new standard on the accounting for employee stock based compensation beginning in the second half of 2005. Purchased In-process Research and Development In connection with the acquisition of the net assets of Triangle completed in January 2003, we recorded purchased in-process research and development expenses of $488.6 million in the first quarter of 2003. The charge was due to Triangle incomplete research and development programs that had not yet reached technological feasibility and had no alternative future use as of the acquisition date. The value of the purchased in-process research and development was determined by estimating the related future net cash flows between 2003 and 2020 using a present value risk adjusted discount rate of 15.75%. This discount rate is a significant assumption and is based on our estimated weighted average cost of capital adjusted upward for the risks associated with the projects acquired. The projected cash flows from the acquired projects were based on estimates of revenues and operating profits related to the projects considering the stage of development of each potential product acquired, the time and resources needed to complete the development and approval of each product, the life of each potential commercialized product and associated risks including the inherent difficulties and uncertainties in 36 developing a drug compound including obtaining FDA and other regulatory approvals, and risks related to the viability of and potential alternative treatments in any future target markets. A summary of these programs at the acquisition date, and updated for subsequent developments through February 2005, is as follows: Program Description Status of Development Estimated Acquisition Date Fair Value (in millions) Emtricitabine for HIV A nucleoside analogue that has been shown to be an inhibitor of HIV replication in patients. Four phase 3 studies were completed prior to the acquisition date. U.S. marketing approval was received from the FDA in July 2003 for Emtriva and European Union approval received from the European Commission in October 2003. $178.8 Emtricitabine/Tenofovir DF Fixed Dose Combination for HIV Therapy A fixed-dose co-formulation of tenofovir and emtricitabine. As of the acquisition date, work had not commenced on the potential co-formulation except to the extent that work on emtricitabine as a single agent was progressing. In March 2004, applications for marketing approval were submitted in the United States and European Union and in August 2004 marketing approval in the United States was received from the FDA for Truvada, the fixed-dose co-formulation of tenofovir and emtricitabine. Marketing approval in the European Union was received in February 2005. $106.4 Amdoxovir for HIV A purine dioxolane nucleoside that may offer advantages over other marketed nucleosides because of its activity against drug resistant viruses as exhibited in patients with HIV infection. This program was in Phase 2 trials at acquisition date. In 2004, we terminated the licensing agreement with Emory University and the University of Georgia Research Foundation, Inc. and development was discontinued. $114.8 Clevudine for HBV A pyrimidine nucleoside analogue that has been shown to be an inhibitor of HBV replication in patients chronically infected with HBV. This program was in Phase 1/2 trials at acquisition date. In August 2003, the licensing agreement with Bukwang Pharm. Ind. Co., Ltd was terminated and development was discontinued. $58.8 Emtricitabine for HBV An inhibitor of HBV replication in patients chronically infected with HBV. One phase 3 trial has been completed as of December 31, 2004. $29.8 37 Asset Impairment During 2003, we recorded an asset impairment charge of $10.2 million on certain of our long-lived assets, primarily leasehold improvements, manufacturing and laboratory equipment. This non-cash charge was driven by the decision in December 2003 to terminate our liposomal research and development activities in San Dimas and discontinue the DaunoXome product line. The impairment was based on our analysis of the undiscounted cash flows to be generated from the affected assets as compared to their carrying value. As the carrying value exceeded the related estimated undiscounted cash flows, we wrote the carrying value of the long-lived assets down to their estimated fair value. In 2004, subsequent to our decision to discontinue the DaunoXome product line, we received unanticipated requests in Europe asking Gilead to reconsider selling DaunoXome. As a result of these requests, management decided to continue selling this product in certain countries and we are still evaluating our supply and sales strategy with respect to DaunoXome. In accordance with U.S. generally accepted accounting principles , the new cost basis for the impaired assets was not adjusted for these new facts and circumstances. Gain (Loss) on Marketable Securities Pursuant to our agreement with Eyetech entered into in March 2000, we received a warrant to purchase 791,667 shares of Eyetech series B convertible preferred stock, exercisable at a price of $6.00 per share. In January 2004, Eyetech completed an initial public offering of its common stock at which time we adjusted the fair value of the warrant resulting in a gain of $20.6 million. At that time, the fair value of the warrant was estimated using the Black-Scholes valuation model with a volatility rate of 50% and a discount rate of 2.8%. At the end of the first quarter of 2004, we exercised the warrant on a net basis using shares of Eyetech common stock as consideration for the exercise price and subsequently held 646,841 shares of Eyetech common stock. In the second quarter of 2004, we sold all of the Eyetech shares we owned and realized a gain of approximately $2.3 million, which is included in interest and other income, net, for the year ended December 31, 2004. In July 2002, we sold all of our remaining shares of OSI common stock for approximately $22.0 million. These shares were partial consideration for the sale of our oncology assets to OSI in December 2001, at which time they were recorded at a fair market value of approximately $38.0 million. In connection with the sale of these remaining shares, we recognized a non-operating loss of approximately $16.0 million in the year ended December 31, 2002. Make-Whole Payment on Debt Redemption In October 2004, Gilead called for the redemption of all its outstanding 2% convertible senior notes due December 15, 2007 on November 20, 2004 . The convertible senior notes were called under a provisional redemption based upon the market price of Gilead common stock exceeding certain thresholds. The aggregate principal amount outstanding of the notes was $345.0 million. The convertible senior notes were redeemable at a redemption price equal to 100% of the principal amount of the notes, plus a cash payment equal to accrued and unpaid interest to the redemption date and a cash make-whole payment equal to $60 per $1,000 principal value of the notes less interest actually paid or accrued and unpaid from the date of issuance of the notes to the redemption date. Interest on the convertible senior notes ceased to accrue on the redemption date, and the only remaining right of the holders thereafter was to receive the redemption payment, including accrued and unpaid interest to the redemption date and the make-whole payment. Alternatively, note holders could elect to convert their notes into shares of Gilead common stock at a price of $23.50 per share, or 42.55 shares of Gilead common stock per $1,000 principal amount of the notes. Holders of substantially all of the outstanding notes converted their notes into shares of Gilead common stock prior to the November 20, 2004 redemption date. As a result of these conversions, 14,676,952 shares of 38 common stock were issued to these note holders. In connection with the redemption, Gilead paid aggregate make-whole payments of $7.4 million to note holders. Interest and Other Income, net We recorded interest and other income of $18.9 million in 2004, compared with $13.0 million in 2003 and $22.3 million in 2002. The increase in 2004 compared to 2003 is primarily attributable to the higher cash balances and yields over the past year. The decrease in 2003 compared to 2002 is attributable to the significant decline in interest rates and a lower average cash balance due to the acquisition of the net assets of Triangle and the purchase of our Foster City campus, partially offset by positive cash flow from operations. Interest income in 2005 will depend principally upon prevailing interest rates and the level of our cash, cash equivalent and marketable securities balances. Interest Expense We incurred interest expense of $7.3 million in 2004, compared with $21.9 million in 2003 and $13.9 million in 2002. The decrease in 2004 over 2003 is primarily due to the conversion of our $250.0 million 5% convertible subordinated debt into shares of our common stock in December 2003. The only outstanding debt during most of 2004 consisted of our $345.0 million 2% convertible senior debt issued in December 2002. In November 2004, we converted our 2% convertible senior notes. The significant increase in 2003 over 2002 is due to the full year of interest on our $345.0 million 2% convertible senior notes which were issued in December 2002. Interest expense for 2003 and 2002 consisted primarily of interest on the $250.0 million 5.0% convertible subordinated notes, which were converted into shares of our common stock in December 2003. We expect interest expense in 2005 to decrease as compared with 2004 primarily due to the conversion of the $345.0 million 2% convertible senior notes in November 2004. Provision for (Benefit from) Income Taxes Our provision for (benefit from) income taxes was $207.1 million, ($95.5) million and $1.3 million in 2004, 2003 and 2002, respectively. The 2004 effective income tax rate of 31.5% differs from the U.S. federal statutory rate of 35% generally due to state taxes being more than offset by the recognition of previously unbenefitted net operating losses, tax credit carryforwards and certain earnings being taxed in foreign tax rate jurisdictions with lower tax rates for which no U.S. taxes have been provided because such earnings are planned to be permanently reinvested outside the United States. The tax benefit in 2003 includes the reversal of our valuation allowance against certain of our deferred tax assets. In December of 2003, we concluded that it was more likely than not that we would realize a portion of the benefit related to our deferred tax assets. Accordingly, we reduced the valuation allowance against the assets and recorded a tax benefit of $111.6 million. The recognition of these deferred tax assets had no impact on our cash flows. Partially offsetting this tax benefit was income tax expense associated with income earned by our foreign subsidiaries, foreign losses benefitted at lower tax rates and the non-tax deductibility of purchased in-process research and development. We had significant net operating loss carryforwards which were used to reduce our U.S. tax liability. Excluding the benefit relating to the reversal of our valuation allowance, and the write off of purchased in-process research and development, our effective tax rate for 2003 was 5%. The income tax expense in 2002 was primarily associated with income earned by our foreign subsidiaries as we had significant net operating losses in the United States. The provision for 2002 was reduced by a change in the U.S. income tax law. This law allowed net operating loss carryforward deductions to offset 100% of alternative minimum taxable income, resulting in a reduction of U.S. income tax recorded in previous years of $1.3 million. 39 On October 22, 2004, the American Jobs Creation Act ( the AJCA ) was signed into law. The AJCA allows for a deduction of 85% of certain foreign earnings that are repatriated, as defined in the AJCA. We may elect to apply this provision to qualifying earnings repatriations in fiscal 2005. We have started an evaluation of the effects of the repatriation provision; however, we do not expect to be able to complete this evaluation until after Congress or the Treasury Department provide additional clarifying language on key elements of the provision. We expect to complete our evaluation of the effects of the repatriation provision within a reasonable period of time following the publication of the additional clarifying language. The range of possible amounts that we are considering for repatriation under this provision is between zero and $500 million (maximum amount allowable to us as defined in the AJCA). Currently, the related potential range of impact on income taxes cannot be reasonably estimated. Liquidity and Capital Resources Cash, cash equivalents and marketable securities totaled $1.25 billion at December 31, 2004, up from $707.0 million at December 31, 2003. In 2004, the increase of $547.0 million was primarily due to net cash provided by operations of $511.4 million and proceeds from issuances of stock under employee stock plans of $78.8 million, partially offset by capital expenditures of $51.4 million. In 2003, the cash decrease of $235.4 million from 2002 was primarily due to the acquisition of Triangle, for which the net cash impact was $375.5 million, the purchase of our Foster City campus for $123.0 million and capital expenditures of $38.6 million, partially offset by proceeds from issuance of stock under employee stock plans of $83.8 million. Working capital at December 31, 2004 was $1.60 billion compared to $1.08 billion at December 31, 2003. Significant changes in working capital during 2004 included a $144.5 million decrease in current deferred tax assets more than offset by a $118.8 million increase in accounts receivable and a $37.9 million increase in inventory. The $144.5 million decrease in current deferred tax assets was primarily due to the utilization of net operating losses and tax credit carryforwards to offset taxable income. The accounts receivable increase of $118.8 million was primarily due to increased sales of Viread in the United States and Europe and sales from our new product, Truvada, launched in the United States in the latter half of 2004. The $37.9 million increase in inventory was primarily due to an increase in the purchase of raw materials and the production of Viread and Truvada inventory to meet increasing sales demand. Current liabilities in 2004 increased by $67.6 million from 2003 primarily due to the following: a $15.0 million increase in Medicaid rebate obligations associated with higher sales of Viread; a $14.4 million increase in deferred revenue primarily due to royalties received from Roche; a $12.9 million increase in the liability associated with the fair value of our forward currency contracts as the U.S. dollar continued to weaken against European currencies; an $11.9 million increase in accounts payable primarily due to increases in our raw material purchases in support of Viread and Truvada sales growth; a $9.7 million increase for increased compensation costs and employee benefits with added headcount; and an increase of $4.1 million for distributors fees owed but not yet paid under the inventory management agreements entered into in July 2004. The increase in current liabilities was partially offset by a $4.3 million decrease in accrued clinical and preclinical expenses as a result of decreasing activity associated with the clinical trial programs for Viread and Hepsera towards the end of 2004. In 2004, we made capital expenditures of $51.4 million compared to $38.6 million in 2003 and $17.6 million in 2002. These expenditures were primarily for domestic and international facilities improvements, including approximately $26.0 million associated with the completion of our pilot plant in Foster City which will be used to develop our drug processes and prepare materials to supply clinical trials, as well as additional spending for laboratory and manufacturing equipment to accommodate our growth. Capital expenditures related to research and development were between 55% and 65% of the $51.4 million spent in 2004, 50% and 60% of the $38.6 million spent in 2003 and 20% to 25% of the $17.6 million spent 40 in 2002. We expect our capital spending for 2005 to be $55 million to $65 million due to increased infrastructure needs and higher R&D spending. We believe that our existing capital resources, supplemented by cash generated from our operations, will be adequate to satisfy our capital needs for the foreseeable future. Our future capital requirements will depend on many factors, including: the commercial performance of our current and future products, the progress and scope of our research and development efforts, including preclinical studies, and clinical trials, the cost, timing and outcome of regulatory reviews, the expansion of our sales and marketing capabilities, administrative expenses, the possibility of acquiring manufacturing capabilities or additional office facilities, the possibility of acquiring other companies or new products, the establishment of additional collaborative relationships with other companies, and defense costs associated with, settlements of and adverse results of litigation. We may in the future require additional funding, which could be in the form of proceeds from equity or debt financings, such as from our universal shelf registration statement filed in December 2003 for the potential issuance of up to $500.0 million of our securities, or additional collaborative agreements with corporate entities. If such funding is required, we cannot assure that it will be available on favorable terms, if at all. Subsidiaries and Other We have established a variety of subsidiaries in various countries for the purpose of conducting business in those locations. All of these subsidiaries are consolidated in our financial statements. We do not have any variable interest entities that are unconsolidated in our financial statements. We are also not involved in any non-exchange traded commodity contracts accounted for at fair value. We have no commercial commitments with related parties, except for employee loans. Contractual Obligations We have contractual obligations in the form of capital and operating leases, non-cancelable raw material supply arrangements and clinical research organization contracts. The following table summarizes these contractual obligations at December 31, 2004 (in thousands): Payments due by period Contractual Obligations Total Less than one year 1-3 years 3-5 years More than 5 years Capital lease obligations $ 476 $ 221 $ 255 $ $ Operating lease obligations 88,630 14,160 27,009 20,615 26,846 Capital commitments(1) 1,966 1,966 Inventory purchase obligations(2) 232,181 104,681 85,000 42,500 Clinical trials(3) 34,893 22,686 7,718 4,489 Total $ 358,146 $ 143,714 $ 119,982 $ 67,604 $ 26,846 41 (1) At December 31, 2004, we had firm capital project commitments of approximately $2.0 million relating to facilities improvement. In addition, we have budgeted significant capital expenditures for 2005, mainly due to anticipated increased infrastructure needs and higher R&D spending. We may have more capital spending in future years. (2) At December 31, 2004, we had firm commitments to purchase active pharmaceutical ingredients. The amounts disclosed only represent minimum purchase requirements. Actual purchases may differ significantly from these amounts. (3) At December 31, 2004, we had several clinical studies in various clinical trial phases. Our most significant expenditures are to contract research organizations. Although most contracts are cancelable, we generally have not cancelled contracts. These amounts reflect commitments based on existing contracts and do not reflect any future modifications to existing contracts and anticipated or potential new contracts. Recent Accounting Pronouncement In December 2004, the FASB issued SFAS No. 123 (revised 2004), Share-Based Payment (SFAS 123R), which is a revision of SFAS 123. SFAS 123R supercedes APB 25 and amends SFAS 95, Statement of Cash Flows . SFAS 123R requires all share-based payments to employees and directors, including grants of stock options, to be recognized in the statement of operations based on their fair values, beginning with the first interim or annual period after June 15, 2005, with early adoption permitted. The pro forma disclosures previously permitted under SFAS 123 no longer will be an alternative to financial statement recognition. We expect to adopt SFAS 123R in our third quarter of fiscal 2005, beginning July 1, 2005. Under SFAS 123R, we must determine the appropriate fair value model to be used for valuing share-based payments, the amortization method for compensation cost and the transition method to be used at date of adoption. The transition methods include prospective and retroactive adoption options. Under the retroactive options, prior periods may be restated either as of the beginning of the year of adoption or for all periods presented. The prospective method requires that compensation expense be recorded for all unvested stock options and restricted stock at the beginning of the first quarter of adoption of SFAS 123R, while the retroactive methods would record compensation expense for all unvested stock options and restricted stock beginning with the first period restated. We are currently evaluating the requirements of SFAS 123R as well as option valuation methodologies related to our employee and director stock options and employee stock purchase plan. Although we have not yet determined the method of adoption or the effect of adopting SFAS 123R, we expect that the adoption of SFAS 123R will have a material impact on our consolidated results of operations and earnings per share. The impact of adoption of SFAS 123R cannot be predicted at this time because it will depend on, among other things, the levels of share-based payments granted in the future, the method of adoption and the option valuation method used. SFAS 123R also requires the benefits of tax deductions in excess of recognized compensation cost to be reported as a financing cash flow, rather than as an operating cash flow as required under current literature. This requirement will reduce net operating cash flows and increase net financing cash flows in periods after adoption. While we cannot estimate what those amounts will be in the future (because they depend on, among other things, when employees and directors exercise stock options), the amount of operating cash flows recognized in prior periods related to tax deductions were $22.0 million, $132.3 million and $0.4 million in 2004, 2003 and 2002, respectively. Current estimates of option values using the Black-Scholes method may not be indicative of results from valuation methodologies ultimately adopted by Gilead. 42
