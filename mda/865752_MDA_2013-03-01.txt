ITEM 7. MANAGEMENT S DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS OF FINANCIAL CONDITION AND RESULTS OF OPERATIONS The following Management Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations ( MD&A ) is provided as a supplement to and should be read in conjunction with our financial statements and the accompanying notes ( Notes ) included in Part II, Item 8 of this Form 10-K. This discussion contains forward-looking statements that are based on management current expectations, estimates and projections about our business and operations. Our actual results may differ materially from those currently anticipated and expressed in such forward-looking statements. See Forward-Looking Statements and Part I. Item 1A Risk Factors. This overview provides our perspective on the individual sections of MD&A. MD&A includes the following sections: Our Business a general description of our business; the value drivers of our business; and opportunities and risks facing our Company; Results of Operations an analysis of our consolidated results of operations for the three years presented in our financial statements; Sales details of our sales measured on a quarterly basis in both dollars and cases; Inflation information about the impact that inflation may or may not have on our results; Liquidity and Capital Resources an analysis of our cash flows, sources and uses of cash and contractual obligations; Accounting Policies and Pronouncements a discussion of accounting policies that require critical judgments and estimates including newly issued accounting pronouncements; Forward-Looking Statements cautionary information about forward-looking statements and a description of certain risks and uncertainties that could cause our actual results to differ materially from the Company historical results or our current expectations or projections; and Market Risks information about market risks and risk management. (See Forward-Looking Statements and Part II, Item 7A Qualitative and Quantitative Disclosures About Market Risks ). Our Business Overview We develop, market, sell and distribute alternative beverage category beverages primarily under the following brand names: Monster Energy Hansen Monster Rehab Hansen Natural Cane Soda Monster Energy Extra Strength Nitrous Technology Junior Juice Java Monster Blue Sky X-Presso Monster Hubert Worx Energy Vidration Peace Tea Our Monster Energy drinks, which represented 92.3%, 91.2% and 89.9% of our net sales for the years ended December 31, 2012, 2011 and 2010, respectively, include the following: Monster Energy Java Monster Kona Blend Lo-Carb Monster Energy Java Monster Loca Moca Monster Energy Assault Java Monster Mean Bean 36 Table of Contents Monster Khaos Java Monster Vanilla Light Monster M-80 (named Ripper in certain countries) Java Monster Irish Blend Monster MIXXD Java Monster Toffee Monster Energy Absolutely Zero Monster Energy Import Monster Energy Extra Strength Nitrous Technology Super Dry Monster Energy Import Light Monster Energy Dub Edition Baller Blend Monster Energy Extra Strength Nitrous Technology Anti-Gravity Monster Energy Dub Edition Mad Dog Monster Rehab Tea + Lemonade + Energy Monster Energy Extra Strength Nitrous Technology Black Ice Monster Rehab Rojo Tea + Energy Monster Rehab Green Tea + Energy X-Presso Monster Hammer X-Presso Monster Midnite Monster Rehab Protean + Energy Monster Cuba-Lima Monster Rehab Tea + Orangeade + Energy Monster Energy Zero Ultra M3 Monster Energy Super Concentrate bermonster Energy Brew We have two reportable segments, namely Direct Store Delivery ( DSD ), whose principal products comprise energy drinks, and Warehouse ( Warehouse ), whose principal products comprise juice-based and soda beverages. The DSD segment develops, markets and sells products primarily through an exclusive distributor network, whereas the Warehouse segment develops, markets and sells products primarily direct to retailers. During the year ended December 31, 2012, we continued to expand our existing product lines and flavors and further developed our markets. In particular, we continued to focus on developing and marketing beverages that fall within the category generally described as the alternative beverage category. During the year ended December 31, 2012, we introduced the following products: Monster Rehab Tea + Orangeade + Energy, a non-carbonated energy drink with electrolytes (February 2012). bermonster Energy Brew, a non-alcoholic energy drink, manufactured using a brewed fermentation process (February 2012). Hansen Coconut Water, in original and tropical flavors, packaged in re-sealable Tetra Prisma boxes (March 2012). Peace Tea Cranberry, Pink Lemonade and Texas-Style Sweet Tea, ready-to-drink iced teas (March 2012). Monster Energy Zero Ultra, a carbonated energy drink which contains zero calories and zero sugar (August 2012). Monster Cuba-Lima , a carbonated lime flavored non-alcoholic energy drink (September 2012). Monster Energy Dub Edition Baller Blend, a carbonated punch + energy drink (October 2012). Monster Energy Dub Edition Mad Dog, a carbonated punch + energy drink (October 2012). In the normal course of business we discontinue certain products and/or product lines. Those products or product lines discontinued in 2012, either individually or in aggregate, did not have a material adverse impact on our financial position, results of operations or liquidity. Our gross sales* of $2,373.5 million for the year ended December 31, 2012 represented record annual sales. The vast majority of our gross sales are derived from our Monster Energy brand energy drinks. Gross sales of our Monster Energy brand energy drinks were $2,205.0 million for the year ended December 31, 2012, an increase of $416.3 million, or 98.4% of our overall increase in gross sales for the year ended December 31, 2012. Any decrease in gross sales of our Monster Energy brand energy drinks could have a significant adverse effect on our future revenues and net income. Competitive pressure in the energy drink category could also adversely affect our operating results. 37 Table of Contents Our gross sales of $1,488.5 million for the year ended December 31, 2010 were negatively impacted by advance purchases made by our customers in the 2009 fourth quarter due to our announcement of a new per case marketing contribution program for our Monster Energy distributors commencing January 1, 2010, as well as to avoid potential interruptions in product supply due to our announcement to transition our North American operations to the SAP enterprise resource planning system commencing January 2010 (the Advance Purchases ). We previously estimated that gross sales for the three-months ended December 31, 2009 were increased by approximately 4% to 6% as a result of the Advance Purchases. We did not limit the amount of our customers purchases during the fourth quarter of 2009. Our DSD segment represented 95.4%, 94.4% and 93.0% of our consolidated net sales for the years ended December 31, 2012, 2011 and 2010, respectively. Our Warehouse segment represented 4.6%, 5.6% and 7.0% of our consolidated net sales for the years ended December 31, 2012, 2011 and 2010, respectively. Our sales and marketing strategy for all our beverages is to focus our efforts on developing brand awareness through image enhancing programs and product sampling. We use our branded vehicles and other promotional vehicles at events where we offer samples of our products to consumers. We utilize push-pull methods to enhance shelf and display space exposure in sales outlets (including advertising, in-store promotions and in-store placement of point-of-sale materials, racks, coolers and barrel coolers) to enhance demand from consumers for our products. We also support our brands with prize promotions, price promotions, competitions, endorsements from selected public and extreme sports figures, personality endorsements (including from television and other well known sports personalities), coupons, sampling and sponsorship of selected causes, events, athletes and teams. In-store posters, outdoor posters, print, radio and television advertising (directly and through our sponsorships and endorsements) and coupons may also be used to promote our brands. We have historically marketed our Monster Energy , Hansen Energy and Blue Energy energy drink products as dietary supplements in accordance with the statutory definition of dietary supplement set forth in the Federal Food, Drug, and Cosmetic Act. However, as permitted under that Act and FDA regulations, we recently decided to transition the labeling and marketing of these energy drink products from dietary supplements to conventional foods. It is anticipated that new labels for such products as conventional foods will be introduced in 2013. Products marketed under the Worx Energy brand, which are sold in 2-ounce bottles, will continue to be labeled as dietary supplements. We do not expect the cost of the labeling changes to be significant. We believe that one of the keys to success in the beverage industry is differentiation, making our brands and products visually distinctive from other beverages on the shelves of retailers. We review our products and packaging on an ongoing basis and, where practical, endeavor to make them different, better and unique. The labels and graphics for many of our products are redesigned from time to time to maximize their visibility and identification, wherever they may be placed in stores, which we will continue to reevaluate from time to time. All of our beverage products are manufactured by various third party bottlers and co-packers situated throughout the United States and abroad, under separate arrangements with each party. Our growth strategy includes expanding our international business. Gross sales to customers outside the United States amounted to $513.9 million, $381.0 million and $240.6 million for the years ended December 31, 2012, 2011 and 2010, respectively. Such sales were approximately 22%, 20% and 16% of gross sales for the years ended December 31, 2012, 2011 and 2010, respectively. 38 Table of Contents Our customers are primarily full service beverage distributors, retail grocery and specialty chains, wholesalers, club stores, drug chains, mass merchandisers, convenience chains, health food distributors, food service customers and the military. Gross sales to our various customer types for the years ended December 31, 2012, 2011 and 2010 are reflected below. Such information includes sales made by us directly to the customer types concerned, which include our full service beverage distributors in the United States. Such full service beverage distributors in turn sell certain of our products to the same customer types listed below. We limit our description of our customer types to include only our sales to such full service distributors without reference to such distributors sales to their own customers. 2012 2011 2010 Full service distributors 63% 64% 64% Club stores, drug chains & mass merchandisers 9% 10% 12% Outside the U.S. 22% 20% 16% Retail grocery, specialty chains and wholesalers 4% 4% 6% Other 2% 2% 2% On October 2, 2010, TCCC completed its acquisition of the North American business operations of CCE, through a merger with a wholly owned subsidiary of TCCC. The surviving wholly owned subsidiary was subsequently renamed CCR, and currently distributes certain of our products in those portions of the United States in which CCE previously distributed certain of our products. Concurrently with this acquisition, New CCE was formed, which currently distributes certain of our products in Great Britain, France, Belgium, the Netherlands, Luxembourg, Monaco and Sweden. Our customers include the TCCC North American Bottlers, Wal-Mart, Inc. (including Sam Club), the AB Distributors, New CCE, Coca-Cola Hellenic, Kalil Bottling Group, Trader Joe s, John Lenore & Company, Swire Coca-Cola, Costco, The Kroger Co. and Safeway, Inc. A decision by any large customer to decrease amounts purchased from us or to cease carrying our products could have a material negative effect on our financial condition and consolidated results of operations. CCR accounted for approximately 28% and 29% of our net sales for the years ended December 31, 2012 and 2011, respectively. CCE, which included their operations in the U.S. for the relevant periods (see distribution agreement (d) in Item 1 Business Distribution Agreements ), accounted for approximately 28% our net sales for the year ended December 31, 2010. We continue to incur expenditures in connection with the development and introduction of new products and flavors. 39 Table of Contents Value Drivers of our Business We believe that the key value drivers of our business include the following: Profitable Growth We believe functional value added brands properly supported by marketing and innovation, targeted to a broad consumer base, drive profitable growth. We continue to broaden our family of brands. In particular, we are expanding our energy drinks and specialty beverages to provide more alternatives to consumers. We are focused on maintaining profit margins and believe that tailored branding, packaging, pricing and distribution channel strategies help achieve profitable growth. We are implementing these strategies with a view to continuing profitable growth. International Growth The introduction, development and sustained profitability of our Monster Energy brand internationally remains a key value driver for our corporate growth. Cost Management The principal focus of cost management will continue to be on reducing input supply and production costs on a per-case basis, including raw material costs and co-packing fees. Another key area of focus is to decrease promotional allowances, selling and general and administrative costs, including sponsorships, sampling, promotional and marketing expenses, as a percentage of net sales. The reduction of accounts receivable and inventory days on hand also remains a further key area of focus. Efficient Capital Structure Our capital structure is intended to optimize our working capital to finance expansion, both domestically and internationally. We believe our strong capital position, our ability to raise funds, if necessary, at low effective cost and low overall costs of borrowings provide a competitive advantage. We believe that, subject to increases in the costs of certain raw materials being contained, these value drivers, when properly implemented in the U.S. and internationally, will result in: (1) maintaining our product gross profit margins; (2) providing additional leverage over time through reduced expenses as a percentage of net operating revenues; and (3) optimizing our cost of capital. The ultimate measure of success is and will be reflected in our current and future results of operations. Gross and net sales, gross profits, operating income, net income and net income per share represent key measurements of the above value drivers. These measurements will continue to be a key management focus in 2013 and beyond ( See Part II, Item 7 Results of Operations Results of Operations for the Year Ended December 31, 2012 Compared to the Year Ended December 31, 2011 ). As of December 31, 2012, the Company had working capital of $546.5 million compared to $916.6 million as of December 31, 2011. The decrease in working capital was primarily the result of the $737.1 million repurchase of the Company common stock during the year ended December 31, 2012. For the year ended December 31, 2012, our net cash provided by operating activities was approximately $287.7 million as compared to $333.8 million for the year ended December 31, 2011. Principal uses of cash flows in 2012 were repurchases of our common stock, purchases of investments, purchases of inventory, development of our Monster Energy brand internationally, acquisition of property and equipment and acquisition of trademarks. These principal uses of cash flows are expected to be and remain our principal recurring use of cash and working capital funds in the future (See Part II, Item 7 Liquidity and Capital Resources ). Opportunities, Challenges and Risks Looking forward, our management has identified certain challenges and risks for the beverage industry and our Company. Legislation has been proposed at the U.S. state and/or municipal level and 40 Table of Contents proposed and/or adopted in certain foreign jurisdictions to restrict the sale of energy drinks (including prohibiting the sale of energy drinks at certain establishments or pursuant to certain governmental programs), limit caffeine content in beverages, require certain product labeling disclosures and/or warnings, impose taxes, limit product sizes or impose age restrictions for the sale of energy drinks. In addition, articles critical of the caffeine content in energy drinks and their perceived benefits and articles indicating certain health risks of energy drinks have recently been published. The proposal and/or adoption of such legislation and the publication of such articles, or the future proposal and/or adoption of similar legislation or publication of similar articles, may adversely affect our Company. In addition, uncertainty and volatility in domestic and international economic markets could negatively affect both the stability of our industry and our Company. Furthermore, our growth strategy includes expanding our international business which exposes us to risks inherent in conducting international operations. Decreased consumer discretionary spending also represents a challenge to the successful marketing and sale of our products. Increases in consumer and regulatory awareness of the health problems arising from obesity and inactive lifestyles continue to represent a challenge. We recognize that obesity is a complex and serious public health problem. Our commitment to consumers begins with our broad product line and a wide selection of diet, light and low calorie beverages, juices and juice drinks, waters and energy drinks. We continuously strive to meet changing consumer needs through beverage innovation, choice and variety. (See Part I, Item 1A Risk Factors ) Our historical success is attributable, in part, to our introduction of different and innovative beverages. Our future success will depend, in part, upon our continued ability to develop and introduce different and innovative beverages, although there can be no assurance of our ability to do so. In order to retain and expand our market share, we must continue to develop and introduce different and innovative beverages and be competitive in the areas of quality, health, method of distribution, brand image and intellectual property protection. The beverage industry is subject to changing consumer preferences that may adversely affect us if we misjudge such preferences. In addition, other key challenges and risks that could impact our Company future financial results include, but are not limited to: changes in consumer preferences and demand for our products; economic uncertainty in the United States, Europe and other countries in which we operate; the risks associated with foreign currency exchange rate fluctuations; maintenance of our brand image and product quality; increasing concern over obesity and changes in regulation and consumer preferences in response to those concerns; increasing concern over caffeine consumption and related regulation of our products containing caffeine; profitable expansion and growth of our family of brands in the competitive market place (See Part I, Item 1 Business Competition and Part I, Item 1 Sales and Marketing ); costs of establishing and promoting our brands internationally; restrictions on imports and sources of supply; duties or tariffs; and changes in government regulations; protection of our existing intellectual property portfolio of trademarks and copyrights and the continuous pursuit to develop and protect new and innovative trademarks and copyrights for our expanding product lines; limitations on available quantities of certain package containers such as the 24-ounce cap-can, the 18.6-ounce BRE can, and co-packing availability; and the imposition of additional regulation, including regulation restricting the sale of energy drinks, limiting caffeine content in beverages, requiring product labeling and/or warnings, or imposing excise taxes limiting product size. 41 Table of Contents See Part I, Item 1A Risk Factors for additional information about risks and uncertainties facing our Company. We believe that the following opportunities exist for us: growth potential of the energy drink category, both domestically and internationally; growth potential of other segments of the alternative beverage category including sparkling beverages, carbonated soft drinks, ready-to-drink iced teas, juice drinks and enhanced waters; planned and future new product and product line introductions with the objective of contributing to higher profitability; the introduction of premium packages designed to generate strong revenue growth; significant package, pricing and channel opportunities to increase profitable growth; effective strategic positioning to capitalize on industry growth; broadening distribution/expansion opportunities in both domestic and international markets; launching our products into new geographic markets; and continued focus on reducing our cost base. 42 Table of Contents Results of Operations (in thousands, except per share information) Percentage Change 2012 2011 2010 12 vs. 11 11 vs. 10 Gross sales, net of discounts & returns* $ 2,373,499 $ 1,950,490 $ 1,488,516 21.7% 31.0% Less: Promotional and other allowances** 312,797 247,260 184,574 26.5% 34.0% Net sales 2,060,702 1,703,230 1,303,942 21.0% 30.6% Cost of sales 995,046 808,921 623,702 23.0% 29.7% Gross profit*** 1,065,656 894,309 680,240 19.2% 31.5% Gross profit margin as a percentage of net sales 51.7% 52.5% 52.2% Operating expenses 515,033 437,886 332,426 17.6% 31.7% Operating expenses as a percentage of net sales 25.0% 25.7% 25.5% Operating income 550,623 456,423 347,814 20.6% 31.2% Operating income as a percentage of net sales 26.7% 26.8% 26.7% Other (expense) income: Interest and other (expense) income, net (2,256) 1,619 2,246 (239.3%) (27.9% ) Gain (loss) on investments and put option, net 787 (772) (758) (201.9%) 1.8% Total other (expense) income (1,469) 847 1,488 Income before provision for income taxes 549,154 457,270 349,302 20.1% 30.9% Provision for income taxes 209,134 171,051 137,273 22.3% 24.6% Net income $ 340,020 $ 286,219 $ 212,029 18.8% 35.0% Net income as a percentage of net sales 16.5% 16.8% 16.3% Net income per common share: Basic $1.96 $1.62 $1.20 20.5% 35.6% Diluted $1.86 $1.53 $1.14 21.1% 34.5% Case sales (in thousands) (in 192-ounce case equivalents) 202,918 164,661 129,031 23.2% 27.6% *Gross sales is used internally by management as an indicator of and to monitor operating performance, including sales performance of particular products, salesperson performance, product growth or declines and overall Company performance. The use of gross sales allows evaluation of sales performance before the effect of any promotional items, which can mask certain performance issues. We therefore believe that the presentation of gross sales provides a useful measure of our operating performance. Gross sales is not a measure that is recognized under GAAP and should not be considered as an alternative to net sales, which is determined in accordance with GAAP, and should not be used alone as an indicator of operating performance in place of net sales. Additionally, 43 Table of Contents gross sales may not be comparable to similarly titled measures used by other companies, as gross sales has been defined by our internal reporting practices. In addition, gross sales may not be realized in the form of cash receipts as promotional payments and allowances may be deducted from payments received from certain customers. (See Part II, Item 6 Selected Financial Data ). ** Although the expenditures described in this line item are determined in accordance with GAAP and meet GAAP requirements, the disclosure thereof does not conform with GAAP presentation requirements. Additionally, our definition of promotional and other allowances may not be comparable to similar items presented by other companies. Promotional and other allowances primarily include consideration given to the Company distributors or retail customers including, but not limited to the following: (i) discounts granted off list prices to support price promotions to end-consumers by retailers; (ii) reimbursements given to the Company distributors for agreed portions of their promotional spend with retailers, including slotting, shelf space allowances and other fees for both new and existing products; (iii) the Company agreed share of fees given to distributors and/or directly to retailers for advertising, in-store marketing and promotional activities; (iv) the Company agreed share of slotting, shelf space allowances and other fees given directly to retailers; (v) incentives given to the Company distributors and/or retailers for achieving or exceeding certain predetermined sales goals; (vi) discounted or free products; (vii) contractual fees given to the Company distributors related to sales made by the Company direct to certain customers that fall within the distributors sales territories; and (viii) commissions paid to our customers. The presentation of promotional and other allowances facilitates an evaluation of their impact on the determination of net sales and the spending levels incurred or correlated with such sales. Promotional and other allowances constitute a material portion of our marketing activities. The Company promotional allowance programs with its numerous distributors and/or retailers are executed through separate agreements in the ordinary course of business. These agreements generally provide for one or more of the arrangements described above and are of varying durations, ranging from one week to one year. ***Gross profit may not be comparable to that of other entities since some entities include all costs associated with their distribution process in cost of sales, whereas others exclude certain costs and instead include such costs within another line item such as operating expenses. We include out-bound freight and warehouse costs in operating expenses rather than in cost of sales. Results of Operations for the Year Ended December 31, 2012 Compared to the Year Ended December 31, 2011. Gross Sales. Gross sales were $2,373.5 million for the year ended December 31, 2012, an increase of approximately $423.0 million, or 21.7% higher than gross sales of $1,950.5 million for the year ended December 31, 2011. The increase in the gross sales of our Monster Energy brand energy drinks represented approximately $416.3 million, or 98.4%, of the overall increase in gross sales. Gross sales of our Monster Energy brand energy drinks increased primarily due to increased sales by volume as a result of increased domestic and international consumer demand as well as our expansion into new international markets. Pricing changes did not have a material impact on the increase in gross sales. No other individual product line contributed either a material increase or decrease to gross sales for the year ended December 31, 2012. Promotional and other allowances, as described in the footnote above, were $312.8 million for the year ended December 31, 2012, an increase of $65.5 million, or 26.5% higher than promotional and other allowances of $247.3 million for the year ended December 31, 2011. Promotional and other allowances as a percentage of gross sales increased to 13.2% from 12.7% for the years ended December 31, 2012 and 2011, respectively. As a result of the increase in promotional and other allowances as a percentage of gross sales, the percentage increase in gross sales for the year ended December 31, 2012 was higher than the percentage increase in net sales. Changes in foreign currency exchange rates had an unfavorable impact on gross sales of approximately 1% for the year ended December 31, 2012, which was primarily due to a stronger U.S. dollar compared to certain local currencies in which we conduct certain of our international business. Net Sales. Net sales were $2,060.7 million for the year ended December 31, 2012, an increase of approximately $357.5 million, or 21.0% higher than net sales of $1,703.2 million for the year ended December 31, 2011. The increase in net sales of our Monster Energy brand energy drinks represented 44 Table of Contents approximately $348.5 million, or 97.5%, of the overall increase in net sales. Net sales of our Monster Energy brand energy drinks increased primarily due to increased sales by volume as a result of increased domestic and international consumer demand as well as our expansion into new international markets. Pricing changes did not have a material impact on the increase in net sales. No other individual product line contributed either a material increase or decrease to net sales for the year ended December 31, 2012. Changes in foreign currency exchange rates had an unfavorable impact on net sales of approximately 1% for the year ended December 31, 2012, which was primarily due to a stronger U.S. dollar compared to certain local currencies in which we conduct certain of our international business. Case sales, in 192-ounce case equivalents, were 202.9 million cases for the year ended December 31, 2012, an increase of approximately 38.3 million cases or 23.2% higher than case sales of 164.7 million cases for the year ended December 31, 2011. The overall average net sales per case decreased to $10.16 for the year ended December 31, 2012, which was 1.8% lower than the average net sales per case of $10.34 for the year ended December 31, 2011. The lower overall average net sales per case was primarily due to increased promotional and other allowances as a percentage of gross sales, product and geographic mix. Net sales for the DSD segment were $1,966.5 million for the year ended December 31, 2012, an increase of approximately $358.2 million, or 22.3% higher than net sales of $1,608.3 million for the year ended December 31, 2011. The increase in net sales of our Monster Energy brand energy drinks represented approximately $348.5 million, or 97.3%, of the overall increase in net sales for the DSD segment. Net sales for the DSD segment of our Monster Energy brand energy drinks increased primarily due to increased sales by volume as a result of increased domestic and international consumer demand as well as our expansion into new international markets. Pricing changes did not have a material impact on the increase in net sales for the DSD segment. No other individual product line contributed either a material increase or decrease to net sales for the DSD segment for the year ended December 31, 2012. Net sales for the Warehouse segment were $94.2 million for the year ended December 31, 2012, a decrease of approximately $0.7 million, or 0.7% lower than net sales of $94.9 million for the year ended December 31, 2011. The decrease in net sales for the Warehouse segment was primarily attributable to decreased sales by volume of apple juice and Hansen sodas. The decrease in net sales for the Warehouse segment was partially offset by increased sales by volume of Hubert lemonades. Gross Profit. Gross profit was $1,065.7 million for the year ended December 31, 2012, an increase of approximately $171.3 million, or 19.2% higher than the gross profit of $894.3 million for the year ended December 31, 2011. Gross profit as a percentage of net sales decreased to 51.7% for the year ended December 31, 2012 from 52.5% for the year ended December 31, 2011. The increase in gross profit dollars was primarily the result of the $416.3 million increase in gross sales of our Monster Energy brand energy drinks. The decrease in gross profit as a percentage of net sales was largely attributable to changes in product and geographic mix, increased promotional and other allowances as a percentage of gross sales as well as production variances and product damages primarily in connection with Europe and Asia. Operating Expenses . Total operating expenses were $515.0 million for the year ended December 31, 2012, an increase of approximately $77.1 million, or 17.6% higher than total operating expenses of $437.9 million for the year ended December 31, 2011. The increase in operating expenses was partially attributable to increased payroll expenses of $23.4 million (of which $9.0 million was related to an increase in stock-based compensation), increased expenditures of $18.4 million for sponsorships and endorsements, increased out-bound freight and warehouse costs of $17.9 million, increased expenditures of $11.1 million for allocated trade development, increased expenditures of $6.4 million for 45 Table of Contents marketing fees and increased expenditures of $4.2 million for merchandise displays. The increase in operating expenses was partially offset by decreased expenditures of $9.6 million for advertising, decreased expenditures of $8.0 million for commissions and royalties paid to non-customers and $4.1 million of insurance reimbursements related to legal fees incurred in prior periods. Total operating expenses as a percentage of net sales was 25.0% for the year ended December 31, 2012, compared to 25.7% for the year ended December 31, 2011. Contribution Margin. Contribution margin for the DSD segment was $660.6 million for the year ended December 31, 2012, an increase of approximately $117.4 million, or 21.6% higher than contribution margin of $543.2 million for the year ended December 31, 2011. The increase in the contribution margin for the DSD segment was primarily the result of the $416.3 million increase in gross sales of our Monster Energy brand energy drinks. Contribution margin for the Warehouse segment was $3.5 million for the year ended December 31, 2012, approximately $0.8 million lower than contribution margin of $4.3 million for the year ended December 31, 2011. Operating Income. Operating income was $550.6 million for the year ended December 31, 2012, an increase of approximately $94.2 million, or 20.6% higher than operating income of $456.4 million for the year ended December 31, 2011. Operating income as a percentage of net sales decreased to 26.7% for the year ended December 31, 2012 from 26.8% for the year ended December 31, 2011. The increase in operating income was primarily due to an increase in gross profit of $171.3 million, partially offset by a $77.1 million increase in operating expenses. The decrease in operating income as a percentage of net sales was primarily due to a decrease in gross profit as a percentage of net sales. Operating income was negatively affected by combined operating losses of $10.1 million and $15.4 million for the years ended December 31, 2012 and 2011, respectively, in relation to our operations in Africa, Asia, Australia, Europe, the Middle East and South America. Other (Expense) Income . Other (expense) income was ($1.5) million for the year ended December 31, 2012, as compared to other (expense) income of $0.8 million for the year ended December 31, 2011. Interest income was $1.4 million and $1.2 million for the years ended December 31, 2012 and 2011, respectively. Net foreign currency losses were $3.7 million and $0.7 million for the years ended December 31, 2012 and 2011, respectively. Provision for Income Taxes . Provision for income taxes was $209.1 million for the year ended December 31, 2012, an increase of $38.1 million or 22.3% higher than the provision for income taxes of $171.1 million for the year ended December 31, 2011. The effective combined federal, state and foreign tax rate increased to 38.1% from 37.4% for the years ended December 31, 2012 and 2011, respectively. The increase in the effective tax rate was primarily the result of increased losses in certain foreign subsidiaries for which there is no tax benefit, the establishment of full valuation allowances against the deferred tax assets of certain foreign subsidiaries, as well as a higher effective combined state tax rate. Net Income . Net income was $340.0 million for the year ended December 31, 2012, an increase of $53.8 million or 18.8% higher than net income of $286.2 million for the year ended December 31, 2011. The increase in net income was primarily attributable to an increase in gross profit of $171.3 million. The increase in net income was partially offset by an increase in operating expenses of $77.1 million and an increase in the provision for income taxes of $38.1 million. Results of Operations for the Year Ended December 31, 2011 Compared to the Year Ended December 31, 2010. Gross Sales. Gross sales were $1,950.5 million for the year ended December 31, 2011, an increase of approximately $462.0 million, or 31.0% higher than gross sales of $1,488.5 million for the 46 Table of Contents year ended December 31, 2010. The increase in the gross sales of our Monster Energy brand energy drinks represented approximately $446.7 million, or 96.7%, of the overall increase in gross sales. Gross sales of our Monster Energy brand energy drinks increased primarily due to increased sales by volume as a result of increased consumer demand in both our existing domestic and international markets as well as our expansion into new international markets. Pricing changes did not have a material impact on the increase in gross sales. No other individual product line contributed either a material increase or decrease to gross sales for the year ended December 31, 2011. Promotional and other allowances were $247.3 million for the year ended December 31, 2011, an increase of $62.7 million, or 34.0% higher than promotional and other allowances of $184.6 million for the year ended December 31, 2010. Promotional and other allowances as a percentage of gross sales increased to 12.7% from 12.4% for the years ended December 31, 2011 and 2010, respectively. As a result, the percentage increase in gross sales for the year ended December 31, 2011 was higher than the percentage increase in net sales. Net Sales. Net sales were $1,703.2 million for the year ended December 31, 2011, an increase of approximately $399.3 million, or 30.6% higher than net sales of $1,303.9 million for the year ended December 31, 2010. The increase in net sales of our Monster Energy brand energy drinks represented approximately $380.0 million, or 95.2%, of the overall increase in net sales. Net sales of our Monster Energy brand energy drinks increased primarily due to increased sales by volume as a result of increased consumer demand in both our existing domestic and international markets as well as our expansion into new international markets. Pricing changes did not have a material impact on the increase in net sales. No other individual product line contributed either a material increase or decrease to net sales for the year ended December 31, 2011. Case sales, in 192-ounce case equivalents, were 164.7 million cases for the year ended December 31, 2011, an increase of approximately 35.6 million cases or 27.6% higher than case sales of 129.0 million cases for the year ended December 31, 2010. The overall average net sales per case increased to $10.34 for the year ended December 31, 2011, which was 2.4% higher than the average net sales per case of $10.11 for the year ended December 31, 2010. The increase in the average net sales per case was attributable to an increase in the proportion of case sales derived from higher priced products, primarily our Monster Energy brand energy drinks. Net sales for the DSD segment were $1,608.3 million for the year ended December 31, 2011, an increase of approximately $395.7 million, or 32.6% higher than net sales of $1,212.6 million for the year ended December 31, 2010. The increase in the net sales of our Monster Energy brand energy drinks represented approximately $380.0 million, or 96.0%, of the overall increase in net sales for the DSD segment. Net sales for the DSD segment of our Monster Energy brand energy drinks increased primarily due to increased sales by volume as a result of increased consumer demand in both our existing domestic and international markets as well as our expansion into new international markets. Pricing changes did not have a material impact on the increase in net sales for the DSD segment. No other individual product line contributed either a material increase or decrease to net sales for the DSD segment for the year ended December 31, 2011. Net sales for the Warehouse segment were $94.9 million for the year ended December 31, 2011, an increase of approximately $3.6 million, or 4.0% higher than net sales of $91.3 million for the year ended December 31, 2010. The increase in net sales for the Warehouse segment was primarily attributable to decreased promotional and other allowances. Gross Profit. Gross profit was $894.3 million for the year ended December 31, 2011, an increase of approximately $214.1 million, or 31.5% higher than the gross profit of $680.2 million for the year ended December 31, 2010. Gross profit as a percentage of net sales increased slightly to 52.5% for the year ended December 31, 2011 from 52.2% for the year ended December 31, 2010. The increase in gross profit dollars was primarily the result of the $446.7 million increase in gross sales of our Monster Energy brand energy drinks. 47 Table of Contents Operating Expenses . Total operating expenses were $437.9 million for the year ended December 31, 2011, an increase of approximately $105.5 million, or 31.7% higher than total operating expenses of $332.4 million for the year ended December 31, 2010. The increase in operating expenses was partially attributable to increased payroll expenses of $14.3 million, increased out-bound freight and warehouse costs of $13.9 million, increased expenditures of $13.6 million for sponsorships and endorsements, increased expenditures of $13.0 million for advertising, increased expenditures of $12.3 million for allocated trade development, increased expenditures of $10.5 million for commissions, increased expenditures for promotional items of $7.1 million, increased expenditures of $6.5 million for merchandise displays, increased expenditures of $3.6 million for samples and increased expenditures of $10.7 million for other operating expenses. Total operating expenses as a percentage of net sales was 25.7% for the year ended December 31, 2011, compared to 25.5% for the year ended December 31, 2010. Contribution Margin. Contribution margin for the DSD segment was $543.2 million for the year ended December 31, 2011, an increase of approximately $106.5 million, or 24.4% higher than the contribution margin of $436.7 million for the year ended December 31, 2010. The increase in the contribution margin for the DSD segment was primarily the result of the $380.0 million increase in net sales of our Monster Energy brand energy drinks. Contribution margin for the Warehouse segment was $4.3 million for the year ended December 31, 2011, approximately $5.1 million higher than the contribution margin of ($0.8) million for the year ended December 31, 2010. The increase in the contribution margin for the Warehouse segment was primarily attributable to decreased promotional and other allowances and lower selling expenses. Operating Income. Operating income was $456.4 million for the year ended December 31, 2011, an increase of approximately $108.6 million, or 31.2% higher than operating income of $347.8 million for the year ended December 31, 2010. Operating income as a percentage of net sales was 26.8% and 26.7% for the years ended December 31, 2011 and 2010, respectively. The increase in operating income was primarily due to an increase in gross profit of $214.1 million, partially offset by a $105.5 million increase in operating expenses. Operating income was negatively affected by combined operating losses of $15.4 million and $9.2 million for the years ended December 31, 2011 and 2010, respectively, in relation to our new and existing markets in Europe, the Middle East, Africa, Australasia and South America. Other (Expense) Income . Other (expense) income was $0.8 million for the year ended December 31, 2011, a decrease of $0.6 million from $1.5 million for the year ended December 31, 2010. This decrease was primarily attributable to an increase in foreign currency losses. Provision for Income Taxes . Provision for income taxes was $171.1 million for the year ended December 31, 2011, an increase of $33.8 million or 24.6% higher than the provision for income taxes of $137.3 million for the year ended December 31, 2010. The effective combined federal, state and foreign tax rate decreased to 37.4% from 39.3% for the years ended December 31, 2011 and 2010, respectively. The decrease in the effective tax rate was primarily the result of a lower effective combined state tax rate and the establishment of a full valuation allowance against the deferred tax assets of a foreign subsidiary established during the second fiscal quarter of 2010. The decrease in the effective tax rate was partially offset by the increase in the reserve for certain uncertain tax benefits. Net Income . Net income was $286.2 million for the year ended December 31, 2011, an increase of $74.2 million or 35.0% higher than net income of $212.0 million for the year ended December 31, 2010. The increase in net income was primarily attributable to an increase in gross profit of $214.1 million. The increase in net income was partially offset by an increase in operating expenses of $105.5 million and an increase in the provision for income taxes of $33.8 million. 48 Table of Contents Sales The table set forth below discloses selected quarterly data regarding sales for the past five years. Data from any one or more quarters is not necessarily indicative of annual results or continuing trends. Sales of beverages are expressed in unit case volume. A unit case means a unit of measurement equal to 192 U.S. fluid ounces of finished beverage (24 eight-ounce servings). Unit case volume means the number of unit cases (or unit case equivalents) of beverages sold by us. Our quarterly results of operations reflect seasonal trends that are primarily the result of increased demand in the warmer months of the year. It has been our experience that beverage sales tend to be lower during the first and fourth quarters of each calendar year. In addition, our experience with our energy drink products suggests they are less seasonal than the seasonality expected from traditional beverages. Quarterly fluctuations may also be affected by other factors including the introduction of new products, the opening of new markets where temperature fluctuations are more pronounced, the addition of new bottlers, customers and distributors, changes in the sales mix of our products and changes in and/or increased advertising and promotional expenses.

Average net sales per case exclusive of this recognition were $10.26 and $9.96 for the three-months and year ended December 31, 2008, respectively. Inflation We do not believe that inflation had a significant impact on our results of operations for the years ended December 31, 2012, 2011 or 2010. 49 Table of Contents Liquidity and Capital Resources Cash flows provided by operating activities Net cash provided by operating activities was $287.7 million for the year ended December 31, 2012, as compared with net cash provided by operating activities of $333.8 million for the year ended December 31, 2011. For the year ended December 31, 2012, cash provided by operating activities was primarily attributable to net income earned of $340.0 million and adjustments for certain non-cash expenses consisting of $28.4 million of stock-based compensation, $20.5 million of depreciation and other amortization and a $1.1 million loss on put options. For the year ended December 31, 2012, cash provided by operating activities also increased due to a $14.2 million increase in income taxes payable, a $6.5 million increase in accrued liabilities, a $3.7 million increase in accounts payable, a $2.7 million increase in accrued promotional allowances and a $2.5 million increase in accrued compensation. For the year ended December 31, 2012, cash provided by operating activities was reduced due to a $47.6 million increase in inventory, a $33.2 million increase in prepaid income taxes, a $19.7 million increase in tax benefit from the exercise of stock options, a $17.8 million increase in accounts receivable, a $5.7 million decrease in deferred revenue, a $4.5 million increase in prepaid expenses and other current assets, a $2.5 million increase in deferred income taxes and a $1.9 million gain on investments. For the year ended December 31, 2011, cash provided by operating activities was primarily attributable to net income earned of $286.2 million and adjustments for certain non-cash expenses consisting of $19.4 million of stock-based compensation and $17.0 million of depreciation and other amortization. For the year ended December 31, 2011, cash provided by operations also increased due to a $28.4 million increase in accrued promotional allowances, a $26.3 million increase in accounts payable, a $13.9 million increase in income taxes payable, a $9.5 million decrease in prepaid income taxes, a $8.1 million increase in accrued liabilities and a $2.9 million increase in accrued compensation. For the year ended December 31, 2011, cash provided by operating activities was reduced due to a $56.8 million increase in accounts receivable, a $6.3 million decrease in deferred revenue, a $6.2 million increase in prepaid expenses and other current assets, a $4.5 million increase in inventory and a $3.8 million increase in tax benefit from the exercise of stock options. Cash flows provided by (used in) investing activities Net cash provided by investing activities was $271.8 million for the year ended December 31, 2012, as compared to net cash used in investing activities of $173.0 million for the year ended December 31, 2011. For the year ended December 31, 2012, cash used in investing activities was primarily attributable to purchases of held-to-maturity investments, purchases of available-for-sale investments, purchases of property and equipment, including the purchase of real property, and additions to intangibles. For the year ended December 31, 2011, cash used in investing activities was primarily attributable to purchases of held-to-maturity investments, purchases of available-for-sale investments, purchases of property and equipment and additions to intangibles. For both the years ended December 31, 2012 and 2011, cash provided by investing activities was primarily attributable to maturities of held-to-maturity investments, sales of available-for-sale investments and sales of trading investments. For both the years ended December 31, 2012 and 2011, cash used in investing activities also included the acquisitions of fixed assets consisting of vans and promotional vehicles, coolers and other equipment to support our marketing and promotional activities, production equipment, furniture and fixtures, office and computer equipment, computer software, and equipment used for sales and administrative activities, as well as certain leasehold improvements. We expect to continue to use a portion of our cash in excess of our requirements for operations for purchasing short-term and long-term investments, and for other corporate purposes, including leasehold improvements, the acquisition of capital equipment, specifically, vans, trucks and promotional vehicles, coolers, other promotional equipment, merchandise displays, warehousing racks as well as items of production equipment required to produce certain of our existing and/or new products and to develop our brand in international markets. From time to time, we may also purchase additional real property related to our beverage business and/or acquire compatible businesses as a use of cash in excess of our requirements for operations. 50 Table of Contents Cash flows used in financing activities Net cash used in financing activities was $699.1 million for the year ended December 31, 2012, as compared to net cash used in financing activities of $154.2 million for the year ended December 31, 2011. For the year ended December 31, 2012, cash used in financing activities was primarily attributable to $727.7 million of purchases of common stock. For the year ended December 31, 2012, cash provided by financing activities was primarily attributable to $11.0 million received from the issuance of common stock in connection with the exercise of certain stock options and a $19.7 million tax benefit from the exercise of stock options. For the year ended December 31, 2011, cash used in financing activities was primarily attributable to $176.4 million of purchases of common stock. For the year ended December 31, 2011, cash provided by financing activities was primarily attributable to $20.3 million received from the issuance of common stock in connection with the exercise of certain stock options and a $3.8 million tax benefit from the exercise of stock options. Purchases of inventories, increases in accounts receivable and other assets, acquisition of property and equipment, leasehold improvements, acquisition and maintenance of trademarks, payments of accounts payable, income taxes payable and purchases of our common stock are expected to remain our principal recurring use of cash. Cash and cash equivalents, short-term and long-term investments As of December 31, 2012, we had $222.5 million in cash and cash equivalents and $118.4 million in short-term and long-term investments. We have historically invested these amounts in U.S. Treasury bills, U.S. government agency securities and municipal securities (which may have an auction reset feature), corporate notes and bonds, variable rate demand notes and money market funds meeting certain criteria. We maintain our investments for cash management purposes and not for purposes of speculation. Our risk management policies emphasize credit quality (primarily based on short-term ratings by nationally recognized statistical organizations) in selecting and maintaining our investments. We regularly assess market risk of our investments and believe our current policies and investment practices adequately limit those risks. However, certain of these investments are subject to general credit, liquidity, market and interest rate risks. These risks associated with our investment portfolio may have an adverse effect on our future results of operations, liquidity and financial condition. We believe that cash available from operations, including our cash resources and the revolving line of credit, will be sufficient for our working capital needs, including purchase commitments for raw materials and inventory, increases in accounts receivable, payments of tax liabilities, expansion and development needs, purchases of shares of our common stock, as well as any purchases of capital assets, equipment and properties, through at least the next 12 months. Based on our current plans, at this time we estimate that capital expenditures are likely to be less than $50.0 million through December 31, 2013. However, future business opportunities may cause a change in this estimate. The following represents a summary of the Company contractual commitments and related scheduled maturities as of December 31, 2012: Payments due by period (in thousands) Obligations Total Less than 1 year 1-3 years 3-5 years More than 5 years Contractual Obligations $ 100,512 $ 50,995 $ 49,517 $ - $ - Capital Leases 534 534 - - - Operating Leases 15,578 4,173 9,967 1,111 327 Purchase Commitments 53,217 53,217 - - - $ 169,841 $ 108,919 $ 59,484 $ 1,111 $ 327 Contractual obligations include our obligations related to sponsorships and other commitments. Purchase commitments include obligations made by us and our subsidiaries to various suppliers for raw materials used in the production of our products. These obligations vary in terms, but are generally satisfied within one year. 51 Table of Contents In addition, approximately $0.9 million of recognized tax benefits have been recorded as liabilities as of December 31, 2012. The recognized tax benefits decreased by $1.0 million in the year ended December 31, 2012 mainly due to the completion of certain tax audits. We are uncertain as to if or when the remaining amounts may be settled. We have also recorded a liability for potential penalties and interest of $0.3 million as of December 31, 2012. In March 2012, the Company acquired an approximately 75,425 square foot, free standing, three-story office building, including the real property thereunder and improvements thereon, located in Corona, CA (the March 2012 Property ), which we have not occupied, for a purchase price of $9.7 million. In October 2012, the Company acquired an approximately 141,000 square foot, free standing, six-story office building, including the real property thereunder and improvements thereon, located in Corona, CA (the October 2012 Property ) adjacent to the March 2012 Property, for a purchase price of $18.8 million. The Company intends to complete the necessary improvements to the October 2012 Property and occupy the building as the Company new corporate headquarters at some time in the future. The October 2012 Property should more effectively address the future growth needs of the Company, compared to the March 2012 Property. In December 2012, the Company commenced marketing efforts to sell the March 2012 Property. Accounting Policies and Pronouncements Critical Accounting Policies Our consolidated financial statements are prepared in accordance with GAAP. GAAP requires us to make estimates and assumptions that affect the reported amounts in our consolidated financial statements. The following summarizes our most significant accounting and reporting policies and practices: Investments Our investments in debt securities are classified as either held-to-maturity, available-for-sale or trading, in accordance with the Financial Accounting Standards Board (the FASB ) Accounting Standards Codification ( ASC ) 320. Held-to-maturity securities are those securities that we have the positive intent and ability to hold until maturity. Trading securities are those securities that we intend to sell in the near term. All other securities not included in the held-to-maturity or trading category are classified as available-for-sale. Held-to-maturity securities are recorded at amortized cost which approximates fair market value. Trading securities are carried at fair value with unrealized gains and losses charged to earnings. Available-for-sale securities are carried at fair value with unrealized gains and losses recorded within accumulated other comprehensive income (loss) as a separate component of stockholders equity. ASC 820 defines fair value as the price that would be received to sell an asset or paid to transfer a liability in an orderly transaction between market participants at the measurement date. ASC 820 also establishes a fair value hierarchy which requires an entity to maximize the use of observable inputs, where available (see Note 3 Fair Value of Certain Financial Assets and Liabilities in the notes to consolidated financial statements). Under ASC 320-10-35, a security is considered to be other-than-temporarily impaired if the present value of cash flows expected to be collected are less than the security amortized cost basis (the difference being defined as the Credit Loss ) or if the fair value of the security is less than the security amortized cost basis and the investor intends, or will be required, to sell the security before recovery of the security amortized cost basis. If an other-than-temporary impairment exists, the charge to earnings is limited to the amount of Credit Loss if the investor does not intend to sell the security, and will not be required to sell the security, before recovery of the security amortized cost basis. Any 52 Table of Contents remaining difference between fair value and amortized cost is recognized in other comprehensive income (loss), net of applicable taxes. We evaluate whether the decline in fair value of our investments is other-than-temporary at each quarter-end. This evaluation consists of a review by management, and includes market pricing information and maturity dates for the securities held, market and economic trends in the industry and information on the issuer financial condition and, if applicable, information on the guarantors financial condition. Factors considered in determining whether a loss is temporary include the length of time and extent to which the investment fair value has been less than its cost basis, the financial condition and near-term prospects of the issuer and guarantors, including any specific events which may influence the operations of the issuer and our intent and ability to retain the investment for a reasonable period of time sufficient to allow for any anticipated recovery of fair value. Accounts Receivable We evaluate the collectability of our trade accounts receivable based on a number of factors. In circumstances where we become aware of a specific customer inability to meet its financial obligations to us, a specific reserve for bad debts is estimated and recorded, which reduces the recognized receivable to the estimated amount we believe will ultimately be collected. In addition to specific customer identification of potential bad debts, bad debt charges are recorded based on our recent loss history and an overall assessment of past due trade accounts receivable outstanding. Inventories Inventories are stated at the lower of cost to purchase and/or manufacture the inventory or the current estimated market value of the inventory. We regularly review our inventory quantities on hand and record a provision for excess and obsolete inventory based primarily on our estimated forecast of product demand, production availability and/or our ability to sell the product(s) concerned. Demand for our products can fluctuate significantly. Factors that could affect demand for our products include unanticipated changes in consumer preferences, general market and economic conditions or other factors that may result in cancellations of advance orders or reductions in the rate of reorders placed by customers and/or continued weakening of economic conditions. Additionally, management estimates of future product demand may be inaccurate, which could result in an understated or overstated provision required for excess and obsolete inventory. Long-Lived Assets Management regularly reviews property and equipment and other long-lived assets, including certain definite-lived identifiable intangible assets, for possible impairment. This review occurs annually or more frequently if events or changes in circumstances indicate the carrying amount of the asset may not be recoverable. If there is indication of impairment of property and equipment or amortizable intangible assets, then management prepares an estimate of future cash flows (undiscounted and without interest charges) expected to result from the use of the asset and its eventual disposition. If these cash flows are less than the carrying amount of the asset, an impairment loss is recognized to write down the asset to its estimated fair value. The fair value is estimated at the present value of the future cash flows discounted at a rate commensurate with management estimates of the business risks. No impairment indicators were identified as of December 31, 2012 or 2011. Long-lived assets held for sale are recorded at the lower of their carrying amount or fair value less cost to sell. Management believes that the accounting estimate related to impairment of its long-lived assets, including its trademarks (as discussed below), is a critical accounting estimate because: (1) the estimate is highly susceptible to change from period to period because it requires Company management to make assumptions about cash flows and discount rates; and (2) the impact that recognizing an impairment would have on the assets reported on our consolidated balance sheet, as well as net income, could be material. Management assumptions about cash flows and discount rates require significant judgment because actual revenues and expenses have fluctuated in the past and are expected to continue to do so. 53 Table of Contents Intangibles Intangibles are comprised primarily of trademarks that represent our exclusive ownership of the Monster Energy and trademarks, the Monster Rehab trademark, the Hansen trademark, the Blue Sky trademark, and the Junior Juice trademark, all used in connection with the manufacture, sale and distribution of supplements and beverages. We also own in our own right a number of other trademarks in the United States, as well as in a number of countries around the world. During 2002, we adopted ASC 350. Under the provisions of ASC 350, we discontinued amortization on indefinite-lived trademarks while continuing to amortize remaining definite-lived trademarks over one to 25 years. In accordance with ASC 350, we evaluate our trademarks annually for impairment or earlier if there is an indication of impairment. If there is an indication of impairment of identified intangible assets not subject to amortization, management compares the estimated fair value with the carrying amount of the asset. An impairment loss is recognized to write down the intangible asset to its fair value if it is less than the carrying amount. The fair value is calculated using the income approach. However, preparation of estimated expected future cash flows is inherently subjective and is based on management best estimate of assumptions concerning expected future conditions. Based on management impairment analysis performed for the year ended December 31, 2012, the estimated fair values of trademarks exceeded the carrying values. In estimating future revenues, we use internal budgets. Internal budgets are developed based on recent revenue data and future marketing plans for existing product lines and planned timing of future introductions of new products and their impact on our future cash flows. Revenue Recognition We recognize revenue when persuasive evidence of an arrangement exists, delivery has occurred, the sales price is fixed or determinable and collectability is reasonably assured. Generally, ownership of and title to our products pass to customers upon delivery of the products to customers. Certain of our distributors may also perform a separate function as a co-packer on our behalf. In such cases, ownership of and title to our products that are co-packed on our behalf by those co-packers who are also distributors, passes to such distributors when we are notified by them that they have taken transfer or possession of the relevant portion of our finished goods. Net sales are determined after deducting promotional and other allowances in accordance with ASC 605-50. Amounts received pursuant to new and/or amended distribution agreements entered into with certain distributors, relating to the costs associated with terminating our prior distributors, are accounted for as revenue ratably over the anticipated life of the respective distribution agreement, which is generally 20 years. Management believes that adequate provision has been made for cash discounts, returns and spoilage based on our historical experience. Cost of Sales Cost of sales consists of the costs of raw materials utilized in the manufacture of products, co-packing fees, repacking fees, in-bound freight charges, as well as certain internal transfer costs, warehouse expenses incurred prior to the manufacture of our finished products and certain quality control costs. Raw materials account for the largest portion of the cost of sales. Raw materials include cans, bottles, other containers, ingredients and packaging materials. Operating Expenses Operating expenses include selling expenses such as distribution expenses to transport products to customers and warehousing expenses after manufacture, as well as expenses for advertising, commissions, sampling and in-store demonstration costs, costs for merchandise displays, point-of-sale materials and premium items, sponsorship expenses, other marketing expenses and design expenses. Operating expenses also include payroll costs, travel costs, professional service fees including legal fees, termination payments made to certain of our prior distributors, entertainment costs, insurance costs, postage costs, depreciation and other general and administrative costs. 54 Table of Contents Stock-Based Compensation The Company accounts for stock-based compensation under the provisions of ASC 718. The Company records compensation expense for employee stock options based on the estimated fair value of the options on the date of grant using the Black-Scholes-Merton option pricing formula. The Company records compensation expense for non-employee stock options based on the estimated fair value of the options as of the earlier of (1) the date on which a commitment for performance by the non-employee to earn the stock option is reached or (2) the date on which the non-employee performance is complete, using the Black-Scholes-Merton option pricing formula. Stock-based compensation cost for restricted stock awards and restricted stock units is measured based on the closing fair market value of the Company common stock at the date of grant. In the event that the Company has the option and intent to settle a restricted stock unit in cash, the award is classified as a liability and revalued at each balance sheet date. Income Taxes We utilize the liability method of accounting for income taxes as set forth in ASC 740. Under the liability method, deferred taxes are determined based on the temporary differences between the financial statement and tax basis of assets and liabilities using tax rates expected to be in effect during the years in which the basis differences reverse. A valuation allowance is recorded when it is more likely than not that some of the deferred tax assets will not be realized. In determining the need for valuation allowances we consider projected future taxable income and the availability of tax planning strategies. If in the future we determine that we would not be able to realize our recorded deferred tax assets, an increase in the valuation allowance would be recorded, decreasing earnings in the period in which such determination is made. We assess our income tax positions and record tax benefits for all years subject to examination based upon our evaluation of the facts, circumstances and information available as of the reporting date. For those tax positions where there is a greater than 50% likelihood that a tax benefit will be sustained, we have recorded the largest amount of tax benefit that may potentially be realized upon ultimate settlement with a taxing authority that has full knowledge of all relevant information. For those income tax positions where there is less than 50% likelihood that a tax benefit will be sustained, no tax benefit has been recognized in the financial statements.
