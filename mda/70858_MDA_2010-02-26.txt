Bank of America 2009 15 Table of Contents Executive Summary Business Overview The Corporation is a Delaware corporation, a bank holding company and a financial holding company. Our principal executive offices are located in the Bank of America Corporate Center in Charlotte, North Carolina. Through our banking and various nonbanking subsidiaries throughout the United States and in certain international markets, we provide a diversified range of banking and nonbanking financial services and products through six business segments : Deposits, Global Card Services, Home Loans & Insurance, Global Banking, Global Markets and Global Wealth & Investment Management (GWIM), with the remaining operations recorded in All Other . At December 31, 2009, the Corporation had $2.2 trillion in assets and approximately 284,000 full-time equivalent employees. On January 1, 2009, we acquired Merrill Lynch & Co., Inc. (Merrill Lynch) and as a result we have one of the largest wealth management businesses in the world with approximately 15,000 financial advisors and more than $2.1 trillion in net client assets. Additionally, we are a global leader in corporate and investment banking and trading across a broad range of asset classes serving corporations, governments, institutions and individuals around the world. On July 1, 2008, we acquired Countrywide Financial Corporation (Countrywide) significantly expanding our mortgage origination and servicing capabilities, making us a leading mortgage originator and servicer. As of December 31, 2009, we currently operate in all 50 states, the District of Columbia and more than 40 foreign countries. In addition, our retail banking footprint covers approximately 80 percent of the U.S. population and in the U.S. we serve approximately 59 million consumer and small business relationships with approximately 6,000 banking centers, more than 18,000 ATMs, nationwide call centers, and leading online and mobile banking platforms. We have banking centers in 12 of the 15 fastest growing states and have leadership positions in eight of those states. We offer industry-leading support to approximately four million small business owners. The following table provides selected consolidated financial data for 2009 and 2008.

For additional information on these ratios and a corresponding reconciliation to GAAP financial measures, see Supplemental Financial Data beginning on page 25. 2009 Economic Environment 2009 was a transition year as the U.S. economy began to stabilize although unemployment continued to rise. Gross Domestic Product, which fell sharply in the first quarter and continued to decline in the second quarter, rebounded in the second half of the year but remained well below its earlier expansion peak level. Consumer spending, which had declined sharply in the second half of 2008, rose modestly in each quarter of 2009 and received a boost from the U.S. government Cash-for-Clunkers auto subsidies in the third quarter. Consumer spending remained tentative as households saved more and paid down debt. After reaching lows in January, housing activity increased compared to 2008 as home sales and new housing starts rose through the year lifting residential construction. Nevertheless, large inventories of unsold homes and the increase in foreclosures continued to weigh heavily on the housing sector. Businesses cut production, inventories, employment and capital spending aggressively in response to the financial crisis in late 2008 continuing into 2009. Production and capital spending fell in the first half of the year, inventories declined for the first three quarters and employment declined through the entire year although at a progressively lower rate. U.S. exports increased in the second half of the year reflecting the rebound of certain international economies following the global recession. Despite the modest growth in product demand and output in the second half of the year, job layoffs mounted, and the unemployment rate increased to over 10 percent in the fourth quarter, the highest since the early 1980s. Producing more with fewer workers drove improvement in labor productivity, boosting profits in the second half of the year. 16 Bank of America 2009 Table of Contents The Board of Governors of the Federal Reserve System (Federal Reserve) lowered the federal funds rate to close to zero percent early in the first quarter and in mid-March announced a program of quantitative easing, in which it purchased U.S. Treasuries, mortgage-backed securities (MBS) and long-term debt of government-sponsored enterprises (GSEs). This program contributed to lower mortgage rates generating an increase in consumer mortgage refinancing which helped homeowners, and along with lower home prices, stimulated activity in the housing market. In early 2009, the short-term funding markets began to return to normal and the U.S. government began to unwind its alternative liquidity facilities, and loan and asset guarantee programs. By mid-year, order had been restored to most financial market sectors. The stock market fell sharply through mid-March, but rebounded abruptly, triggered in part by the U.S. government bank stress tests and banks successful capital raising. The stock market rally through year end retraced some of the losses in household net worth and increased consumer confidence. Our consumer businesses were affected by the economic factors mentioned above, as our Deposits business was negatively impacted by spread compression. Global Card Services was affected as reduced consumer spending led to lower revenue and a higher level of bankruptcies led to increased provision for credit losses. Home Loans & Insurance benefited from the low interest rate environment and lower home prices, driving higher mortgage production income; however, higher unemployment and falling home values drove increases in the provision for credit losses. In addition, the factors mentioned above negatively impacted growth in the consumer loan portfolio including credit card and real estate. Global Banking felt the impact of the above economic factors as businesses paid down debt reducing loan balances. In addition, the commercial portfolio within Global Banking declined due to further reductions in spending by businesses as they sought to increase liquidity, and the resurgence of capital markets which allowed corporate clients to issue bonds and equity to replace loans as a source of funding. The commercial real estate and commercial domestic portfolios experienced higher net charge-offs reflecting deterioration across a broad range of industries, property types and borrowers. In addition to increased net charge-offs, nonperforming loans, leases and foreclosed properties and commercial criticized utilized exposures were higher which contributed to increased reserves across most portfolios during the year. Capital markets conditions showed some signs of improvement during 2009 and Global Markets took advantage of the favorable trading environment. Market dislocations that occurred throughout 2008 continued to impact our results in 2009, although to a lesser extent, as we experienced reduced write-downs on legacy assets compared to the prior year. During 2009, our credit spreads improved driving negative credit valuation adjustments on the Corporation derivative liabilities recorded in Global Markets and on Merrill Lynch structured notes recorded in All Other. GWIM also benefited from the improvement in capital markets driving growth in client assets resulting in increased fees and brokerage commissions. In addition, we continued to provide support to certain cash funds during 2009 although to a lesser extent than in the prior year. As of December 31, 2009, all capital commitments to these cash funds had been terminated and the funds no longer hold investments in structured investment vehicles (SIVs). On a going forward basis, the continued weakness in the global economy and recent and proposed regulatory changes will continue to affect many of the markets in which we do business and may adversely impact our results for 2010. The impact of these conditions is dependent upon the timing, degree and sustainability of the economic recovery. Regulatory Overview In November 2009, the Federal Reserve issued amendments to Regulation E, which implement the Electronic Fund Transfer Act (Regulation E). The new rules have a compliance date of July 1, 2010. These amendments change, among other things, the way we and other banks may charge overdraft fees; by limiting our ability to charge an overdraft fee for ATM and one-time debit card transactions that overdraw a consumer account, unless the consumer affirmatively consents to the bank payment of overdrafts for those transactions. Changes to our overdraft practices will negatively impact future service charge revenue primarily in Deposits. On May 22, 2009, the Credit Card Accountability Responsibility and Disclosure Act of 2009 (CARD Act) was signed into law. The majority of the CARD Act provisions became effective in February 2010. The CARD Act legislation contains comprehensive credit card reform related to credit card industry practices including significantly restricting banks ability to change interest rates and assess fees to reflect individual consumer risk, changing the way payments are applied and requiring changes to consumer credit card disclosures. Under the CARD Act, banks must give customers 45 days notice prior to a change in terms on their account and the grace period for credit card payments changes from 14 days to 21 days. The CARD Act also requires banks to review any accounts that were repriced since January 1, 2009 for a possible rate reduction. As announced in October 2009, we did not increase interest rates on consumer card accounts in response to provisions in the CARD Act prior to its effective date unless the customer account fell past due or was based on a variable interest rate. Within Global Card Services, the provisions in the CARD Act are expected to negatively impact net interest income, due to the restrictions on our ability to reprice credit cards based on risk, and card income due to restrictions imposed on certain fees. In July 2009, the Basel Committee on Banking Supervision released a consultative document entitled Revisions to the Basel II Market Risk Framework that would significantly increase the capital requirements for trading book activities if adopted as proposed. The proposal recommended implementation by December 31, 2010, but regulatory agencies are currently evaluating the proposed rulemaking and related impacts before establishing final rules. As a result, we cannot determine the implementation date or the final capital impact. In December 2009, the Basel Committee on Banking Supervision issued a consultative document entitled Strengthening the Resilience of the Banking Sector. If adopted as proposed, this could increase significantly the aggregate equity that bank holding companies are required to hold by disqualifying certain instruments that previously have qualified as Tier 1 capital. In addition, it would increase the level of risk-weighted assets. The proposal could also increase the capital charges imposed on certain assets potentially making certain businesses more expensive to conduct. Regulatory agencies have not opined on the proposal for implementation. We continue to assess the potential impact of the proposal. As a result of the financial crisis, the financial services industry is facing the possibility of legislative and regulatory changes that would impose significant, adverse changes on its ability to serve both retail and wholesale customers. A proposal is currently being considered to levy a tax or fee on financial institutions with assets in excess of $50 billion to repay the costs of TARP, although the proposed tax would continue even after those costs are repaid. If enacted as proposed, the tax could significantly affect our earnings, either by increasing the costs of our liabilities or causing us to reduce our assets. It remains uncertain whether the tax will be enacted, to whom it would apply, or the amount of the tax we would be required to pay. It is also unclear the extent to which the costs of such a tax could be recouped through higher pricing. Bank of America 2009 17 Table of Contents In addition, various proposals for broad-based reform of the financial regulatory system are pending. A majority of these proposals would not disrupt our core businesses, but a proposal could ultimately be adopted that adversely affects certain of our businesses. The proposals would require divestment of certain proprietary trading activities, or limit private equity investments. Other proposals, which include limiting the scope of an institution derivatives activities, or forcing certain derivatives activities to be traded on exchanges, would diminish the demand for, and profitability of, certain businesses. Several other proposals would require issuers to retain unhedged interests in any asset that is securitized, potentially severely restricting the secondary market as a source of funding for consumer or commercial lending. There are also numerous proposals pending on how to resolve a failed systemically important institution. In light of the current regulatory environment, one ratings agency has placed Bank of America and certain other banks on negative outlook, and therefore adoption of such provisions may adversely affect our access to credit markets. It remains unclear whether any of these proposals will ultimately be enacted, and what form they may take. For additional information on these items, refer to Item 1A., Risk Factors. Performance Overview Net income was $6.3 billion in 2009, compared with $4.0 billion in 2008. Including preferred stock dividends and the impact from the repayment of the U.S. government $45.0 billion preferred stock investment in the Corporation under the Troubled Asset Relief Program (TARP), income applicable to common shareholders was a net loss of $2.2 billion, or $(0.29) per diluted share. Those results compared with 2008 net income applicable to common shareholders of $2.6 billion, or $0.54 per diluted share. Revenue, net of interest expense on a fully taxable-equivalent (FTE) basis, rose to $120.9 billion representing a 63 percent increase from $74.0 billion in 2008 reflecting in part the addition of Merrill Lynch and the full-year impact of Countrywide. Net interest income on a FTE basis increased to $48.4 billion compared with $46.6 billion in 2008. The increase was the result of a favorable rate environment, improved hedge results and the acquisitions of Countrywide and Merrill Lynch, offset in part by lower asset and liability management (ALM) portfolio levels, lower consumer loan balances and an increase in nonperforming loans. The net interest yield narrowed 33 basis points (bps) to 2.65 percent. Noninterest income rose to $72.5 billion compared with $27.4 billion in 2008. Higher trading account profits, equity investment income, investment and brokerage services fees and investment banking income reflected the addition of Merrill Lynch while higher mortgage banking and insurance income reflected the full-year impact of Countrywide. Gains on sales of debt securities increased driven by sales of agency MBS and collateralized mortgage obligations (CMOs). Equity investment income benefited from pre-tax gains of $7.3 billion related to the sale of portions of our investment in China Construction Bank (CCB) and a pre-tax gain of $1.1 billion on our investment in BlackRock, Inc. (BlackRock). In addition, trading account profits benefited from decreased write-downs on legacy assets of $6.5 billion compared to the prior year. The other income (loss) category included a $3.8 billion gain from the contribution of our merchant processing business to a joint venture. This was partially offset by a decline in card income of $5.0 billion mainly due to higher credit losses on securitized credit card loans and lower fee income. In addition, noninterest income was negatively impacted by $4.9 billion in net losses mostly related to credit valuation adjustments on the Merrill Lynch structured notes. The provision for credit losses was $48.6 billion, an increase of $21.7 billion compared to 2008, reflecting deterioration in the economy and housing markets which drove higher credit costs in both the consumer and commercial portfolios. Higher reserve additions resulted from further deterioration in the purchased impaired consumer portfolios obtained through acquisitions, broad-based deterioration in the core commercial portfolio and the impact of deterioration in the housing markets on the residential mortgage portfolio. Noninterest expense increased to $66.7 billion compared with $41.5 billion in 2008. Personnel costs and other general operating expenses rose due to the addition of Merrill Lynch and the full-year impact of Countrywide. Pre-tax merger and restructuring charges rose to $2.7 billion from $935 million a year earlier due to the acquisition of Merrill Lynch. For the year, we recognized a tax benefit of $1.9 billion compared with tax expense of $420 million in 2008. The decrease in tax expense was due to certain tax benefits, as well as a shift in the geographic mix of the Corporation earnings driven by the addition of Merrill Lynch. TARP Repayment In efforts to help stabilize financial institutions, in October 2008, the U.S. Department of the Treasury (U.S. Treasury) created the TARP to invest in certain eligible financial institutions in the form of non-voting, senior preferred stock. We participated in the TARP by issuing to the U.S. Treasury non-voting perpetual preferred stock (TARP Preferred Stock) and warrants for a total of $45.0 billion. On December 2, 2009, the Corporation received approval from the U.S. Treasury and the Federal Reserve to repay the $45.0 billion investment. In accordance with the approval, on December 9, 2009, we repurchased all shares of the TARP Preferred Stock by using $25.7 billion from excess liquidity and $19.3 billion in proceeds from the sale of 1.3 billion units of Common Equivalent Securities (CES) valued at $15.00 per unit. In addition, the Corporation agreed to increase equity by $3.0 billion through asset sales in 2010 and approximately $1.7 billion through the issuance in 2010 of restricted stock in lieu of a portion of incentive cash compensation to certain of the Corporation associates as part of their 2009 year-end performance award. As a result of repurchasing the TARP Preferred Stock, the Corporation accelerated the remaining accretion of the issuance discount on the TARP Preferred Stock of $4.0 billion and recorded a corresponding charge to retained earnings and income (loss) applicable to common shareholders in the calculation of diluted earnings per common share. While participating in the TARP, we recorded $7.4 billion in dividends and accretion, including $2.7 billion in cash dividends and $4.7 billion of accretion on the TARP Preferred Stock (the remaining accretion of $4.0 billion was included as part of the $45.0 billion cash payment). Repayment will save us approximately $3.6 billion in annual dividends, including $2.9 billion in cash and $720 million of discount accretion. At the time we repurchased the TARP Preferred Stock, we did not repurchase the related warrants. The U.S. Treasury recently announced its intention to auction, during March 2010, these warrants. We issued the CES, which qualify as Tier 1 common capital, because we did not have a sufficient number of authorized common shares available for issuance at the time we repaid the TARP Preferred Stock. Each CES consisted of one depositary share representing a 1/1000th interest in a share of our Common Equivalent Junior Preferred Stock, Series S (Common Equivalent Stock) and a contingent warrant to purchase 0.0467 of a share of our common stock for a purchase price of $0.01 per share. The Corporation held a special meeting of shareholders on February 23, 2010 at which we obtained stockholder approval of an amendment to our amended and restated certificate of incorporation to increase the number of authorized shares of our common stock, and following the effective date of the amendment, on February 24, 2010, the Common Equivalent Stock converted in full into our common stock and the contingent warrants expired without having become exercisable and the CES ceased to exist. 18 Bank of America 2009 Table of Contents Recent Accounting Developments On January 1, 2010, the Corporation adopted new Financial Accounting Standards Board (FASB) guidance that results in the consolidation of entities that were off-balance sheet as of December 31, 2009. The adoption of this new accounting guidance resulted in a net incremental increase in assets on January 1, 2010, on a preliminary basis, of $100 billion, including $70 billion resulting from consolidation of credit card trusts and $30 billion from consolidation of other special purpose entities including multi- seller conduits. These preliminary amounts are net of retained interests in securitizations held on our balance sheet and an $11 billion increase in the allowance for loan losses, the majority of which relates to credit card receivables. This increase in the allowance for loan losses was recorded on January 1, 2010 as a charge net-of-tax to retained earnings for the cumulative effect of the adoption of this new accounting guidance. Initial recording of these assets and related allowance and liabilities on the Corporation balance sheet had no impact on results of operations.

(2) Global Card Services is presented on a managed basis with a corresponding offset recorded in All Other . Deposits net income narrowed due to declines in net revenue and increased noninterest expense. Net revenue declined mainly due to a lower net interest income allocation from ALM activities and spread compression as interest rates declined. This decrease was partially offset by growth in average deposits on strong organic growth and the migration of certain client deposits from GWIM partially offset by an expected decline in higher-yielding Countrywide deposits. Noninterest expense increased as a result of higher Federal Deposit Insurance Corporation (FDIC) insurance and special assessment costs. Global Card Services reported a net loss as credit costs continued to rise reflecting weak economies in the U.S., Europe and Canada. Managed net revenue declined mainly due to lower fee income driven by changes in consumer retail purchase and payment behavior in the current economic environment and the absence of one-time gains that positively impacted 2008 results. The decline was partially offset by higher net interest income as lower funding costs outpaced the decline in average managed loans. Provision for credit losses increased as economic conditions led to higher losses. Home Loans & Insurance net loss widened as higher credit costs continued to negatively impact results. Net revenue and noninterest expense increased primarily driven by the full-year impact of Countrywide and higher loan production from increased refinance activity. Provision for credit losses increased driven by continued economic and housing market weakness combined with further deterioration in the purchased impaired portfolio. Global Banking net income declined as increases in revenue driven by strong deposit growth, the impact of the Merrill Lynch acquisition and favorable market conditions for debt and equity issuances were more than offset by increased credit costs. Provision for credit losses increased driven by higher net charge-offs and reserve additions in the commercial real estate and commercial domestic portfolios. These increases reflect deterioration across a broad range of property types, industries and borrowers. Noninterest expense increased as a result of the Merrill Lynch acquisition, and higher FDIC insurance and special assessment costs. Global Markets net income increased driven by the addition of Merrill Lynch and a more favorable trading environment. Net revenue increased due to improved market conditions and new issuance capabilities due to the addition of Merrill Lynch driving increased fixed income, currency and commodity, and equity revenues. In addition, improved market conditions led to significantly lower write-downs on legacy assets compared with the prior year. GWIM net income increased driven by the addition of Merrill Lynch partially offset by a lower net interest income allocation from ALM activities, the migration of client balances to Deposits and Home Loans & Insurance, lower average equity market levels and higher credit costs. Net revenue more than doubled as a result of higher investment and brokerage services income due to the addition of Merrill Lynch, the gain on our investment in BlackRock and the lower level of support we provided for certain cash funds. Provision for credit losses increased driven by higher net charge-offs in the consumer real estate and commercial portfolios. All Other net income increased driven by higher equity investment income and increased gains on the sale of debt securities partially offset by negative credit valuation adjustments on certain Merrill Lynch structured notes as credit spreads improved. Results were also impacted by lower other-than-temporary impairment charges primarily related to non-agency CMOs. Excluding the securitization impact to show Global Card Services on a managed basis, the provision for credit losses increased due to higher credit costs related to our ALM residential mortgage portfolio. Bank of America 2008 19 Table of Contents Financial Highlights Net Interest Income Net interest income on a FTE basis increased $1.9 billion to $48.4 billion for 2009 compared to 2008. The increase was driven by the improved interest rate environment, improved hedge results, the acquisitions of Countrywide and Merrill Lynch, the impact of new draws on previously securitized accounts and the contribution from market-based net interest income related to our Global Markets business which benefited from the Merrill Lynch acquisition. These items were partially offset by the impact of deleveraging the ALM portfolio earlier in 2009, lower consumer loan levels and the adverse impact of nonperforming loans. The net interest yield on a FTE basis decreased 33 bps to 2.65 percent for 2009 compared to 2008 due to the factors related to the core businesses as described above. For more information on net interest income on a FTE basis, see Tables I and II beginning on page 95.

Card income on a held basis decreased $5.0 billion primarily due to higher credit losses on securitized credit card loans and lower fee income which was driven by changes in consumer retail purchase and payment behavior in the current economic environment. Service charges grew $722 million due to the acquisition of Merrill Lynch. Investment and brokerage services increased $6.9 billion primarily due to the acquisition of Merrill Lynch partially offset by the impact of lower valuations in the equity markets driven by the market downturn in the fourth quarter of 2008, which improved modestly in 2009, and net outflows in the cash funds. Investment banking income increased $3.3 billion due to higher debt, equity and advisory fees reflecting the increased size of the investment banking platform from the acquisition of Merrill Lynch. Equity investment income increased $9.5 billion driven by $7.3 billion in gains on sales of portions of our CCB investment and a $1.1 billion gain related to our BlackRock investment. The results were partially offset by the absence of the Visa-related gain recorded during the prior year. Trading account profits (losses) increased $18.1 billion primarily driven by favorable core trading results and reduced write-downs on legacy assets partially offset by negative credit valuation adjustments on derivative liabilities of $801 million due to improvement in the Corporation credit spreads. Mortgage banking income increased $4.7 billion driven by higher production and servicing income of $3.2 billion and $1.5 billion. These increases were primarily due to increased volume as a result of the full-year impact of Countrywide and higher refinance activity partially offset by lower MSR results, net of hedges. Insurance income increased $927 million due to the full-year impact of Countrywide property and casualty businesses. Gains on sales of debt securities increased $3.6 billion due to the favorable interest rate environment and improved credit spreads. Gains were primarily driven by sales of agency MBS and CMOs. The net loss in other decreased $1.6 billion primarily due to the $3.8 billion gain from the contribution of our merchant processing business to a joint venture, reduced support provided to cash funds and lower write-downs on legacy assets offset by negative credit valuation adjustments recorded on Merrill Lynch structured notes of $4.9 billion. Net impairment losses recognized in earnings on available-for-sale (AFS) debt securities decreased $625 million driven by lower collateralized debt obligation (CDO) related impairment losses partially offset by higher impairment losses on non-agency CMOs. Provision for Credit Losses The provision for credit losses increased $21.7 billion to $48.6 billion for 2009 compared to 2008. The consumer portion of the provision for credit losses increased $15.1 billion to $36.9 billion for 2009 compared to 2008. The increase was driven by higher net charge-offs in our consumer real estate, consumer credit card and consumer lending portfolios reflecting deterioration in the economy and housing markets. In addition to higher net charge-offs, the provision increase was also driven by higher reserve additions for deterioration in the purchased impaired and residential mortgage portfolios, new draws on previously securitized accounts as well as an approximate $800 million addition to increase the reserve coverage to approximately 12 months of charge-offs in consumer credit card. These increases were partially offset by lower reserve additions in our unsecured domestic consumer lending portfolios resulting from improved delinquencies and in the home equity portfolio due to the slowdown in the pace of deterioration. In the Countrywide and Merrill Lynch consumer purchased impaired portfolios, the additions to reserves to reflect further reductions in expected principal cash flows were $3.5 billion in 2009 compared to $750 million in 2008. The increase was primarily related to the home equity purchased impaired portfolio. The commercial portion of the provision for credit losses including the provision for unfunded lending commitments increased $6.7 billion to $11.7 billion for 2009 compared to 2008. The increase was driven by higher net charge-offs and higher additions to the reserves in the commercial real estate and commercial domestic portfolios reflecting deterioration across a broad range of property types, industries and borrowers. These increases were partially offset by lower reserve additions in the small business portfolio due to improved delinquencies. Net charge-offs totaled $33.7 billion, or 3.58 percent of average loans and leases for 2009 compared with $16.2 billion, or 1.79 percent for 2008. The increased level of net charge-offs is a result of the same factors noted above. 20 Bank of America 2009 Table of Contents Noninterest Expense Table 4 Noninterest Expense (Dollars in millions) 2009 2008 Personnel $ 31,528 $ 18,371 Occupancy 4,906 3,626 Equipment 2,455 1,655 Marketing 1,933 2,368 Professional fees 2,281 1,592 Amortization of intangibles 1,978 1,834 Data processing 2,500 2,546 Telecommunications 1,420 1,106 Other general operating 14,991 7,496 Merger and restructuring charges 2,721 935 Total noninterest expense $ 66,713 $ 41,529 Noninterest expense increased $25.2 billion to $66.7 billion for 2009 compared to 2008. Personnel costs and other general operating expenses rose due to the addition of Merrill Lynch and the full-year impact of Countrywide. Personnel expense rose due to increased revenue and the impacts of Merrill Lynch and Countrywide partially offset by a change in compensation that delivers a greater portion of incentive pay over time. Additionally, noninterest expense increased due to higher litigation costs compared to the prior year, a $425 million pre-tax charge to pay the U.S. government to terminate its asset guarantee term sheet and higher FDIC insurance costs including a $724 million special assessment in 2009. Income Tax Expense Income tax benefit was $1.9 billion for 2009 compared to expense of $420 million for 2008 and resulted in an effective tax rate of (44.0) percent compared to 9.5 percent in the prior year. The change in the effective tax rate from the prior year was due to increased permanent tax preference items as well as a shift in the geographic mix of our earnings driven by the addition of Merrill Lynch. Significant permanent tax preference items for 2009 included the reversal of part of a valuation allowance provided for acquired capital loss carryforward tax benefits, annually recurring tax-exempt income and tax credits, a loss on certain foreign subsidiary stock and the effect of audit settlements. We acquired with Merrill Lynch a deferred tax asset related to a federal capital loss carryforward against which a valuation allowance was recorded at the date of acquisition. In 2009, we recognized substantial capital gains, against which a portion of the capital loss carryforward was utilized. The income of certain foreign subsidiaries has not been subject to U.S. income tax as a result of long-standing deferral provisions applicable to active finance income. These provisions expired for taxable years beginning on or after January 1, 2010. On December 9, 2009, the U.S. House of Representatives passed a bill that would have extended these provisions as well as certain other expiring tax provisions through December 31, 2010. Absent an extension of these provisions, this active financing income earned by foreign subsidiaries after January 1, 2010 will generally be subject to a tax provision that considers the incremental U.S. income tax. The impact of the expiration of these provisions would depend upon the amount, composition and geographic mix of our future earnings and could increase our annual income tax expense by up to $1.0 billion. For more information on income tax expense, see Note 19 Income Taxes to the Consolidated Financial Statements.

At December 31, 2009, total assets were $2.2 trillion, an increase of $405.4 billion, or 22 percent, from December 31, 2008. Average total assets in 2009 increased $593.5 billion, or 32 percent, from 2008. The increases in year-end and average total assets were primarily attributable to the acquisition of Merrill Lynch, which impacted virtually all categories, but particularly federal funds sold and securities borrowed or purchased under agreements to resell, trading account assets, and debt securities. Cash and cash equivalents, which are included in all other assets in the table above, increased due to our strengthened liquidity and capital position. Partially offsetting these increases was a decrease in year-end loans and leases primarily attributable to customer payments, reduced demand and charge-offs. At December 31, 2009, total liabilities were $2.0 trillion, an increase of $351.0 billion, or 21 percent, from December 31, 2008. Average total liabilities for 2009 increased $513.7 billion, or 31 percent, from 2008. The increases in year-end and average total liabilities were attributable to the acquisition of Merrill Lynch which impacted virtually all categories, but particularly federal funds purchased and securities loaned or sold under agreements to repurchase, long-term debt and other liabilities. In addition to the impact of Merrill Lynch, deposits increased as we benefited from higher savings and movement into more liquid products due to the low rate environment. Partially offsetting these increases was a decrease in commercial paper and other short-term borrowings due in part to lower Federal Home Loan Bank (FHLB) borrowings. Federal Funds Sold and Securities Borrowed or Purchased Under Agreements to Resell Federal funds transactions involve lending reserve balances on a short-term basis. Securities borrowed and securities purchased under agreements to resell are utilized to accommodate customer transactions, earn interest rate spreads and obtain securities for settlement. Year-end and average federal funds sold and securities borrowed or purchased under agreements to resell increased $107.5 billion and $107.7 billion in 2009, attributable primarily to the acquisition of Merrill Lynch. Trading Account Assets Trading account assets consist primarily of fixed income securities (including government and corporate debt), equity and convertible instruments. Year-end and average trading account assets increased $47.9 billion and $30.5 billion in 2009, attributable primarily to the acquisition of Merrill Lynch. Debt Securities Debt securities include U.S. Treasury and agency securities, MBS, principally agency MBS, foreign bonds, corporate bonds and municipal debt. We use the debt securities portfolio primarily to manage interest rate and liquidity risk and to take advantage of market conditions that create more economically attractive returns on these investments. The year-end and average balances of debt securities increased $33.9 billion and $20.5 billion from 2008 due to net purchases of securities and the impact of the acquisition of Merrill Lynch. For additional information on our AFS debt securities, see Market Risk Management Securities beginning on page 84 and Note 5 Securities to the Consolidated Financial Statements. Loans and Leases Year-end loans and leases decreased $31.3 billion to $900.1 billion in 2009 compared to 2008 primarily due to lower commercial loans as the result of customer payments and reduced demand, lower customer merger and acquisition activity, and net charge-offs, partially offset by the addition of Merrill Lynch. Average loans and leases increased $37.9 billion to $948.8 billion in 2009 compared to 2008 primarily due to the addition of Merrill Lynch, and the full-year impact of Countrywide. The average consumer loan portfolio increased $24.4 billion due to the addition of Merrill Lynch domestic and foreign securities-based lending margin loans, Merrill Lynch consumer real estate balances, and the full-year impact of Countrywide, partially offset by lower balance sheet retention, sales and conversions of residential mortgages into retained MBS and net charge-offs. The average commercial loan and lease portfolio increased $13.5 billion primarily due to the acquisition of Merrill Lynch. For a more detailed discussion of the loan portfolio, see Credit Risk Management beginning on page 54, and Note 6 Outstanding Loans and Leases to the Consolidated Financial Statements. 22 Bank of America 2009 Table of Contents All Other Assets Year-end and average all other assets increased $247.5 billion and $396.9 billion at December 31, 2009 driven primarily by the acquisition of Merrill Lynch, which impacted various line items, including derivative assets. In addition, the increase was driven by higher cash and cash equivalents due to our strengthened liquidity and capital position. Deposits Year-end and average deposits increased $108.6 billion to $991.6 billion and $149.8 billion to $981.0 billion in 2009 compared to 2008. The increases were in domestic interest-bearing deposits and noninterest-bearing deposits. Partially offsetting these increases was a decrease in foreign interest-bearing deposits. We categorize our deposits as core and market-based deposits. Core deposits exclude negotiable CDs, public funds, other domestic time deposits and foreign interest-bearing deposits. Average core deposits increased $164.4 billion, or 24 percent, to $861.3 billion in 2009 compared to 2008. The increase was attributable to growth in our average NOW and money market accounts and IRAs and noninterest-bearing deposits due to higher savings, the consumer flight-to-safety and movement into more liquid products due to the low rate environment. Average market-based deposit funding decreased $14.6 billion to $119.7 billion in 2009 compared to 2008 due primarily to a decrease in deposits in banks located in foreign countries. Federal Funds Purchased and Securities Loaned or Sold Under Agreements to Repurchase Federal funds transactions involve borrowing reserve balances on a short-term basis. Securities loaned and securities sold under agreements to repurchase are collateralized financing transactions utilized to accommodate customer transactions, earn interest rate spreads and finance inventory positions. Year-end and average federal funds purchased and securities loaned or sold under agreements to repurchase increased $48.6 billion and $96.9 billion primarily due to the Merrill Lynch acquisition. Trading Account Liabilities Trading account liabilities consist primarily of short positions in fixed income securities (including government and corporate debt), equity and convertible instruments. Year-end trading account liabilities increased $13.7 billion in 2009, attributable primarily to increases in equity securities and foreign sovereign debt. Commercial Paper and Other Short-term Borrowings Commercial paper and other short-term borrowings provide a funding source to supplement deposits in our ALM strategy. Year-end and average commercial paper and other short-term borrowings decreased $88.5 billion to $69.5 billion and $63.9 billion to $118.8 billion in 2009 compared to 2008 due, in part, to lower FHLB balances as a result of our strong liquidity position. Long-term Debt Year-end and average long-term debt increased $170.2 billion to $438.5 billion and $215.4 billion to $446.6 billion in 2009 compared to 2008. The increases were attributable to issuances and the addition of long-term debt associated with the Merrill Lynch acquisition. For additional information on long-term debt, see Note 13 Long-term Debt to the Consolidated Financial Statements. All Other Liabilities Year-end and average all other liabilities increased $98.4 billion and $116.3 billion at December 31, 2009 driven primarily by the acquisition of Merrill Lynch, which impacted various line items, including derivative liabilities. Shareholders Equity Year-end and average shareholders equity increased $54.4 billion and $79.8 billion due to a common stock offering of $13.5 billion, $29.1 billion of common and preferred stock issued in connection with the Merrill Lynch acquisition, the issuance of CES of $19.2 billion, an increase in accumulated other comprehensive income (OCI) and net income. These increases were partially offset by repayment of TARP Preferred Stock of $45.0 billion, $30.0 billion of which was issued in early 2009, and higher preferred stock dividend payments. The increase in accumulated OCI was due to unrealized gains on AFS debt and marketable equity securities. Average shareholders equity was also impacted by the issuance of preferred stock and common stock warrants of $30.0 billion in early 2009. This preferred stock was part of the TARP repayment in December 2009.

Other companies may define or calculate supplemental financial data differently. We view net interest income and related ratios and analyses (i.e., efficiency ratio and net interest yield) on a FTE basis. Although this is a non-GAAP measure, we believe managing the business with net interest income on a FTE basis provides a more accurate picture of the interest margin for comparative purposes. To derive the FTE basis, net interest income is adjusted to reflect tax-exempt income on an equivalent before-tax basis with a corresponding increase in income tax expense. For purposes of this calculation, we use the federal statutory tax rate of 35 percent. This measure ensures comparability of net interest income arising from taxable and tax-exempt sources. As mentioned above, certain performance measures including the efficiency ratio and net interest yield utilize net interest income (and thus total revenue) on a FTE basis. The efficiency ratio measures the costs expended to generate a dollar of revenue, and net interest yield evaluates how many bps we are earning over the cost of funds. During our annual planning process, we set efficiency targets for the Corporation and each line of business. We believe the use of this non-GAAP measure provides additional clarity in assessing our results. Targets vary by year and by business, and are based on a variety of factors including maturity of the business, competitive environment, market factors, and other items (e.g., risk appetite). We also evaluate our business based upon ratios that utilize tangible equity. Return on average tangible common shareholders equity measures our earnings contribution as a percentage of common shareholders equity plus CES less goodwill and intangible assets (excluding MSRs), net of related deferred tax liabilities. Return on average tangible shareholders equity (ROTE) measures our earnings contribution as a percentage of average shareholders equity reduced by goodwill and intangible assets (excluding MSRs), net of related deferred tax liabilities. The tangible common equity ratio represents common shareholders equity plus CES less goodwill and intangible assets (excluding MSRs), net of related deferred tax liabilities divided by total assets less goodwill and intangible assets (excluding MSRs), net of related deferred tax liabilities. The tangible equity ratio represents total shareholders equity less goodwill and intangible assets (excluding MSRs), net of related deferred tax liabilities divided by total assets less goodwill and intangible assets (excluding MSRs), net of related deferred tax liabilities. Tangible book value per common share represents ending common shareholders equity plus CES less goodwill and intangible assets (excluding MSRs), net of related deferred tax liabilities divided by ending common shares outstanding plus the number of common shares issued upon conversion of CES. These measures are used to evaluate our use of equity (i.e., capital).

As discussed in the Global Markets business segment section beginning on page 35, we evaluate our market-based results and strategies on a total market-based revenue approach by combining net interest income and noninterest income for Global Markets. We also adjust for loans that we originated and subsequently sold into credit card securitizations. Noninterest income, rather than net interest income and provision for credit losses, is recorded for assets that have been securitized as we are compensated for servicing the securitized assets and record servicing income and gains or losses on securitizations, where appropriate. We believe the use of this non-GAAP presentation provides additional clarity in managing our results. An analysis of core net interest income managed basis, core average earning assets managed basis and core net interest yield on earning assets managed basis, which adjust for the impact of these two non-core items from reported net interest income on a FTE basis, is shown below. Core net interest income on a managed basis increased $2.3 billion to $52.8 billion for 2009 compared to 2008. The increase was driven by the favorable interest rate environment and the acquisitions of Merrill Lynch and Countrywide. These items were partially offset by the impact of deleveraging the ALM portfolio earlier in 2009, lower consumer loan levels and the adverse impact of our nonperforming loans. For more information on our nonperforming loans, see Credit Risk Management on page 54. On a managed basis, core average earning assets increased $130.1 billion to $1.4 trillion for 2009 compared to 2008 primarily due to the acquisitions of Merrill Lynch and Countrywide partially offset by lower loan levels and earlier deleveraging of the AFS debt securities portfolio. Core net interest yield on a managed basis decreased 19 bps to 3.69 percent for 2009 compared to 2008, primarily due to the addition of lower yielding assets from the Merrill Lynch and Countrywide acquisitions, reduced consumer loan levels and the impact of deleveraging the ALM portfolio earlier in 2009 partially offset by the favorable interest rate environment.

Business Segment Operations Segment Description and Basis of Presentation We report the results of our operations through six business segments: Deposits, Global Card Services, Home Loans & Insurance, Global Banking, Global Markets and GWIM , with the remaining operations recorded in All Other . The Corporation may periodically reclassify business segment results based on modifications to its management reporting methodologies and changes in organizational alignment. Prior period amounts have been reclassified to conform to current period presentation. We prepare and evaluate segment results using certain non-GAAP methodologies and performance measures, many of which are discussed in Supplemental Financial Data beginning on page 25. We begin by evaluating the operating results of the segments which by definition exclude merger and restructuring charges. The segment results also reflect certain revenue and expense methodologies which are utilized to determine net income. The net interest income of the business segments includes the results of a funds transfer pricing process that matches assets and liabilities with similar interest rate sensitivity and maturity characteristics. Equity is allocated to business segments and related businesses using a risk-adjusted methodology incorporating each segment stand-alone credit, market, interest rate and operational risk components. The nature of these risks is discussed further beginning on page 44. The Corporation benefits from the diversification of risk across these components which is reflected as a reduction to allocated equity for each segment. Average equity is allocated to the business segments and is affected by the portion of goodwill that is specifically assigned to them. For more information on our basis of presentation, selected financial information for the business segments and reconciliations to consolidated total revenue, net income and year-end total assets, see Note 23 Business Segment Information to the Consolidated Financial Statements.

Deposits includes the results of consumer deposit activities which consist of a comprehensive range of products provided to consumers and small businesses. In addition, Deposits includes our student lending results and an allocation of ALM activities. In the U.S., we serve approximately 59 million consumer and small business relationships through a franchise that stretches coast to coast through 32 states and the District of Columbia utilizing our network of 6,011 banking centers, 18,262 domestic-branded ATMs, telephone, online and mobile banking channels. Our deposit products include traditional savings accounts, money market savings accounts, CDs and IRAs, and noninterest- and interest-bearing checking accounts. Deposit products provide a relatively stable source of funding and liquidity. We earn net interest spread revenues from investing this liquidity in earning assets through client-facing lending and ALM activities. The revenue is allocated to the deposit products using our funds transfer pricing process which takes into account the interest rates and maturity characteristics of the deposits. Deposits also generate fees such as account service fees, non-sufficient funds fees, overdraft charges and ATM fees. During the third quarter of 2009, we announced changes in our overdraft fee policies intended to help customers limit overdraft fees. These changes negatively impacted net revenue beginning in the fourth quarter of 2009. In addition, in November 2009, the Federal Reserve issued Regulation E which will negatively impact future service charge revenue in Deposits . For more information on Regulation E, see Regulatory Overview beginning on page 17. During 2009, our active online banking customer base grew to 29.6 million subscribers, a net increase of 1.3 million subscribers from December 31, 2008 reflecting our continued focus on increasing the use of alternative banking channels. In addition, our active bill pay users paid $302.4 billion of bills online during 2009 compared to $301.1 billion during 2008. Deposits includes the net impact of migrating customers and their related deposit balances between GWIM and Deposits . During 2009, total deposits of $43.4 billion were migrated to Deposits from GWIM. Conversely, $20.5 billion of deposits were migrated from Deposits to GWIM during 2008. The directional shift was mainly due to client segmentation threshold changes resulting from the Merrill Lynch acquisition, partially offset by the acceleration in 2008 of movement of clients into GWIM as part of our growth initiatives for our more affluent customers. As of the date of migration, the associated net interest income, service charges and noninterest expense are recorded in the segment to which deposits were transferred. Net income fell $3.0 billion, or 55 percent, to $2.5 billion as net revenue declined and noninterest expense rose. Net interest income decreased $3.8 billion, or 35 percent, to $7.2 billion as a result of a lower net interest income allocation from ALM activities and spread compression as interest rates declined. Average deposits grew $49.2 billion, or 14 percent, due to strong organic growth and the net migration of certain households deposits from GWIM . Organic growth was driven by the continuing need of customers to manage their liquidity as illustrated by growth in higher spread deposits from new money as well as movement from certificates of deposits to checking accounts and other products. This increase was partially offset by the expected decline in higher-yielding Countrywide deposits. Noninterest income was flat at $6.8 billion as service charges remained unchanged for the year. The positive impacts of revenue initiatives were offset by changes in consumer spending behavior attributable to current economic conditions, as well as the negative impact of the implementation in the fourth quarter of 2009 of the new initiatives aimed at assisting customers who are economically stressed by reducing their banking fees. Noninterest expense increased $910 million, or 10 percent, due to higher FDIC insurance and special assessment costs, partially offset by lower operating costs related to lower transaction volume due to the economy and productivity initiatives. 28 Bank of America 2009 Table of Contents Global Card Services (Dollars in millions) 2009 2008 Net interest income (1) $ 20,264 $ 19,589 Noninterest income: Card income 8,555 10,033 All other income 523 1,598 Total noninterest income 9,078 11,631 Total revenue, net of interest expense 29,342 31,220 Provision for credit losses (2) 30,081 20,164 Noninterest expense 7,961 9,160 Income (loss) before income taxes (8,700 ) 1,896 Income tax expense (benefit) (1) (3,145 ) 662 Net income (loss) $ (5,555 ) $ 1,234 Net interest yield (1) 9.36 % 8.26 % Return on average equity n/m 3.15 Efficiency ratio (1) 27.13 29.34 Balance Sheet Average Total loans and leases $ 216,654 $ 236,714 Total earning assets 216,410 237,025 Total assets 232,643 258,710 Allocated equity 41,409 39,186 Year end Total loans and leases $ 201,230 $ 233,040 Total earning assets 200,988 233,094 Total assets 217,139 252,683 (1) FTE basis (2) Represents provision for credit losses on held loans combined with realized credit losses associated with the securitized loan portfolio. n/m = not meaningful Global Card Services provides a broad offering of products, including U.S. consumer and business card, consumer lending, international card and debit card to consumers and small businesses. We provide credit card products to customers in the U.S., Canada, Ireland, Spain and the United Kingdom. We offer a variety of co-branded and affinity credit and debit card products and are one of the leading issuers of credit cards through endorsed marketing in the U.S. and Europe. On May 22, 2009, the CARD Act which calls for a number of changes to credit card industry practices was signed into law. The provisions in the CARD Act are expected to negatively impact net interest income due to the restrictions on our ability to reprice credit cards based on risk, and card income due to restrictions imposed on certain fees. For more information on the CARD Act, see Regulatory Overview beginning on page 17. The Corporation reports its Global Card Services results on a managed basis which is consistent with the way that management evaluates the results of the business. Managed basis assumes that securitized loans were not sold and presents earnings on these loans in a manner similar to the way loans that have not been sold (i.e., held loans) are presented. Loan securitization is an alternative funding process that is used by the Corporation to diversify funding sources. Loan securitization removes loans from the Consolidated Balance Sheet through the sale of loans to an off-balance sheet qualifying special purpose entity (QSPE). Securitized loans continue to be serviced by the business and are subject to the same underwriting standards and ongoing monitoring as held loans. In addition, excess servicing income is exposed to similar credit risk and repricing of interest rates as held loans. Starting late in the third quarter of 2008 and continuing into the first quarter of 2009, liquidity for asset-backed securitizations became disrupted and spreads rose to historic highs which negatively impacted our credit card securitization programs. Beginning in the second quarter of 2009, conditions started to improve with spreads narrowing and liquidity returning to the marketplace, however, we did not return to the credit card securitization market during 2009. For more information, see the Liquidity Risk and Capital Management discussion beginning on page 47. Global Card Services recorded a net loss of $5.6 billion in 2009 compared to net income of $1.2 billion in 2008 due to higher provision for credit losses as credit costs continued to rise driven by weak economies in the U.S., Europe and Canada. Managed net revenue declined $1.9 billion to $29.3 billion in 2009 driven by lower noninterest income partially offset by growth in net interest income. Net interest income grew to $20.3 billion in 2009 from $19.6 billion in 2008 driven by increased loan spreads due to the beneficial impact of lower short-term interest rates on our funding costs partially offset by a decrease in average managed loans of $20.1 billion, or eight percent. Noninterest income decreased $2.6 billion, or 22 percent, to $9.1 billion driven by decreases in card income of $1.5 billion, or 15 percent, and all other income of $1.1 billion, or 67 percent. The decrease in card income resulted from lower cash advances primarily related to balance transfers, and lower credit card interchange and fee income primarily due to changes in consumer retail purchase and payment behavior in the current economic environment. This decrease was partially offset by the absence of a negative valuation adjustment on the interest-only strip recorded in 2008. In addition, all other income in 2008 included the gain associated with the Visa initial public offering (IPO). Provision for credit losses increased by $9.9 billion to $30.1 billion as economic conditions led to higher losses in the consumer card and consumer lending portfolios including a higher level of bankruptcies. Also contributing to the increase were higher reserve additions related to new draws on previously securitized accounts as well as an approximate $800 million addition to increase the reserve coverage to approximately 12 months of charge-offs in consumer credit card. These reserve additions were partially offset by the beneficial impact of reserve reductions from improving delinquency trends in the second half of 2009. Noninterest expense decreased $1.2 billion, or 13 percent, to $8.0 billion due to lower operating and marketing costs. In addition, noninterest expense in 2008 included benefits associated with the Visa IPO. Bank of America 2009 29 Table of Contents The table below and the following discussion present selected key indicators for the Global Card Services and credit card portfolios. Credit card includes U.S., Europe and Canada consumer credit card and does not include business card, debit card and consumer lending.

(2) Ratios are calculated as managed net losses divided by average outstanding managed loans during the year. Global Card Services managed net losses increased $10.9 billion to $26.7 billion, or 12.30 percent of average outstandings, compared to $15.7 billion, or 6.64 percent in 2008. This increase was driven by portfolio deterioration due to economic conditions including a higher level of bankruptcies. Additionally, consumer lending net charge-offs increased $2.1 billion to $4.3 billion, or 17.75 percent of average outstandings compared to $2.2 billion, or 7.98 percent in 2008. Lower loan balances driven by reduced marketing and tightened credit criteria also adversely impacted net charge-off ratios. Managed consumer credit card net losses increased $7.8 billion to $19.2 billion, or 11.25 percent of average credit card outstandings, compared to $11.4 billion, or 6.18 percent in 2008. The increase was driven by portfolio deterioration due to economic conditions including elevated unemployment, underemployment and a higher level of bankruptcies.

Home Loans & Insurance products are available to our customers through a retail network of 6,011 banking centers, mortgage loan officers in approximately 880 locations and a sales force offering our customers direct telephone and online access to our products. These products are also offered through our correspondent and wholesale loan acquisition channels. Home Loans & Insurance products include fixed and adjustable rate first-lien mortgage loans for home purchase and refinancing needs, reverse mortgages, home equity lines of credit and home equity loans. First mortgage products are either sold into the secondary mortgage market to investors while retaining MSRs and the Bank of America customer relationships, or are held on our balance sheet in All Other for ALM purposes. Home Loans & Insurance is not impacted by the Corporation mortgage production retention decisions as Home Loans & Insurance is compensated for the decision on a management accounting basis with a corresponding offset recorded in All Other . In addition, Home Loans & Insurance offers property, casualty, life, disability and credit insurance. While the results of Countrywide deposit operations are included in Deposits, the majority of its ongoing operations are recorded in Home Loans & Insurance . Countrywide acquired first mortgage and discontinued real estate portfolios are recorded in All Other and are managed as part of our overall ALM activities . Home Loans & Insurance includes the impact of migrating customers and their related loan balances between GWIM and Home Loans & Insurance . As of the date of migration, the associated net interest income and noninterest expense are recorded in the segment to which the customers were migrated. Total loans of $11.5 billion were migrated from GWIM in 2009 compared to $1.6 billion in 2008. The increase was mainly due to client segmentation threshold changes resulting from the Merrill Lynch acquisition. Home Loans & Insurance recorded a net loss of $3.8 billion in 2009 compared to a net loss of $2.5 billion in 2008, as growth in noninterest income and net interest income was more than offset by higher provision for credit losses and higher noninterest expense. Net interest income grew $1.7 billion, or 50 percent, driven primarily by an increase in average loans held-for-sale (LHFS) and home equity loans. The $19.1 billion increase in average LHFS was the result of higher mortgage loan volume driven by the lower interest rate environment. The growth in average home equity loans of $23.7 billion, or 23 percent, was due primarily to the migration of certain loans from GWIM to Home Loans & Insurance as well as the full-year impact of Countrywide balances. Noninterest income increased $5.9 billion to $11.9 billion driven by higher mortgage banking income which benefited from the full-year impact of Countrywide and lower current interest rates which drove higher production income. Provision for credit losses increased $5.0 billion to $11.2 billion driven by continued economic and housing market weakness particularly in geographic areas experiencing higher unemployment and falling home prices. Additionally, reserve increases in the Countrywide home equity purchased impaired loan portfolio were $2.8 billion higher in 2009 compared to 2008 reflecting further reduction in expected principal cash flows. Noninterest expense increased $4.7 billion to $11.7 billion largely due to the full-year impact of Countrywide as well as increased compensation costs and other expenses related to higher production volume and delinquencies. Partly contributing to the increase in expenses was the more than doubling of personnel and other costs in the area of our business that is responsible for assisting distressed borrowers with loan modifications or other workout solutions. Mortgage Banking Income We categorize Home Loans & Insurance mortgage banking income into production and servicing income. Production income is comprised of revenue from the fair value gains and losses recognized on our IRLCs and LHFS and the related secondary market execution, and costs related to representations and warranties in the sales transactions and other obligations incurred in the sales of mortgage loans. In addition, production income includes revenue for transfers of mortgage loans from Home Loans & Insurance to the ALM portfolio related to the Corporation mortgage production retention decisions which is eliminated in All Other . Servicing activities primarily include collecting cash for principal, interest and escrow payments from borrowers, disbursing customer draws for lines of credit and accounting for and remitting principal and interest payments to investors and escrow payments to third parties. Our home retention efforts are also part of our servicing activities, along with responding to customer inquiries and supervising foreclosures and property dispositions. Servicing income includes ancillary income earned in connection with these activities such as late fees, and MSR valuation adjustments, net of economic hedge activities. Bank of America 2009 31 Table of Contents The following table summarizes the components of mortgage banking income. Mortgage Banking Income (Dollars in millions) 2009 2008 Production income $ 5,539 $ 2,105 Servicing income: Servicing fees and ancillary income 6,200 3,531 Impact of customer payments (3,709 ) (3,314 ) Fair value changes of MSRs, net of economic hedge results 712 1,906 Other servicing-related revenue 579 194 Total net servicing income 3,782 2,317 Total Home Loans & Insurance mortgage banking income 9,321 4,422 Other business segments mortgage banking income (loss) (1) (530 ) (335 ) Total consolidated mortgage banking income $ 8,791 $ 4,087 (1) Includes the effect of transfers of mortgage loans from Home Loans & Insurance to the ALM portfolio in All Other . Production income increased $3.4 billion in 2009 compared to 2008. This increase was driven by higher mortgage volumes due in large part to Countrywide and also to higher refinance activity resulting from the lower interest rate environment, partially offset by an increase in representations and warranties expense to $1.9 billion in 2009 from $246 million in 2008. The increase in representations and warranties expense was driven by increased estimates of defaults reflecting deterioration in the economy and housing markets combined with a higher rate of repurchase or similar requests. For further information regarding representations and warranties, see Note 8 Securitizations to the Consolidated Financial Statements and the Consumer Portfolio Credit Risk Management Residential Mortgage discussion beginning on page 56. Net servicing income increased $1.5 billion in 2009 compared to 2008 largely due to the full-year impact of Countrywide which drove an increase of $2.7 billion in servicing fees and ancillary income partially offset by lower MSR performance, net of hedge activities. The fair value changes of MSRs, net of economic hedge results were $712 million and $1.9 billion in 2009 and 2008. The positive 2009 MSRs results were primarily driven by changes in the forward interest rate curve. The positive 2008 MSR results were driven primarily by the expectation that weakness in the housing market would lessen the impact of decreasing market interest rates on expected future prepayments. For further discussion on MSRs and the related hedge instruments, see Mortgage Banking Risk Management on page 86. The following table presents select key indicators for Home Loans & Insurance . Home Loans & Insurance Key Statistics (Dollars in millions, except as noted) 2009 2008 Loan production Home Loans & Insurance: First mortgage $ 357,371 $ 128,945 Home equity 10,488 31,998 Total Corporation (1) : First mortgage 378,105 140,510 Home equity 13,214 40,489 Year end Mortgage servicing portfolio (in billions) (2 ) $ 2,151 $ 2,057 Mortgage loans serviced for investors (in billions) 1,716 1,654 Mortgage servicing rights: Balance 19,465 12,733 Capitalized mortgage servicing rights (% of loans serviced for investors) 113 bps 77 bps (1) In addition to loan production in Home Loans & Insurance , the remaining first mortgage and home equity loan production is primarily in GWIM . ( 2 ) Servicing of residential mortgage loans, home equity lines of credit, home equity loans and discontinued real estate mortgage loans. First mortgage production in Home Loans & Insurance was $357.4 billion in 2009 compared to $128.9 billion in 2008. The increase of $228.4 billion was due in large part to the full-year impact of Countrywide as well as an increase in the mortgage market driven by a decline in interest rates. Home equity production was $10.5 billion in 2009 compared to $32.0 billion in 2008. The decrease of $21.5 billion was primarily due to our more stringent underwriting guidelines for home equity lines of credit and loans as well as lower consumer demand. At December 31, 2009, the consumer MSR balance was $19.5 billion, which represented 113 bps of the related unpaid principal balance as compared to $12.7 billion, or 77 bps of the related principal balance at December 31, 2008. The increase in the consumer MSR balance was driven by increases in the forward interest rate curve and the additional MSRs recorded in connection with sales of loans. This resulted in the 36 bps increase in the capitalized MSRs as a percentage of loans serviced for investors. 32 Bank of America 2009 Table of Contents Global Banking (Dollars in millions) 2009 2008 Net interest income (1) $ 11,250 $ 10,755 Noninterest income: Service charges 3,954 3,233 Investment banking income 3,108 1,371 All other income 4,723 1,437 Total noninterest income 11,785 6,041 Total revenue, net of interest expense 23,035 16,796 Provision for credit losses 8,835 3,130 Noninterest expense 9,539 6,684 Income before income taxes 4,661 6,982 Income tax expense (1) 1,692 2,510 Net income $ 2,969 $ 4,472 Net interest yield (1) 3.34 % 3.30 % Return on average equity 4.93 8.84 Efficiency ratio (1) 41.41 39.80 Balance Sheet Average Total loans and leases $ 315,002 $ 318,325 Total earning assets (2) 337,315 325,764 Total assets (2) 394,140 382,790 Total deposits 211,261 177,528 Allocated equity 60,273 50,583 Year end Total loans and leases $ 291,117 $ 328,574 Total earning assets (2) 343,057 338,915 Total assets (2) 398,061 394,541 Total deposits 227,437 215,519 (1) FTE basis (2) Total earning assets and total assets include asset allocations to match liabilities (i.e., deposits).

Global Banking also includes the results of our merchant services joint venture, as discussed below, and the economic hedging of our credit risk to certain exposures utilizing various risk mitigation tools. Our clients are supported in offices throughout the world that are divided into four distinct geographic regions: U.S. and Canada; Asia Pacific; Europe, Middle East and Africa; and Latin America. For more information on our foreign operations, see Foreign Portfolio beginning on page 74. During the second quarter of 2009, we entered into a joint venture agreement with First Data Corporation (First Data) to form Banc of America Merchant Services, LLC. The joint venture provides payment solutions, including credit, debit and prepaid cards, and check and e-commerce payments to merchants ranging from small businesses to corporate and commercial clients worldwide. We contributed approximately 240,000 merchant relationships, a sales force of approximately 350 associates, and the use of the Bank of America brand name. First Data contributed approximately 140,000 merchant relationships, 200 sales associates and state of the art technology. The joint venture and clients benefit from both companies comprehensive suite of leading payment solutions capabilities. At December 31, 2009, we owned 46.5 percent of the joint venture and we account for our investment under the equity method of accounting. The third party investor has the right to put their interest to the joint venture which would have the effect of increasing the Corporation ownership interest to 49 percent. In connection with the formation of the joint venture, we recorded a pre-tax gain of $3.8 billion which represents the excess of fair value over the carrying value of our contributed merchant processing business. Global Banking net income decreased $1.5 billion, or 34 percent, to $3.0 billion in 2009 compared to 2008 as an increase in revenue was more than offset by higher provision for credit losses and noninterest expense. Net interest income increased $495 million, or five percent, as average deposits grew $33.7 billion, or 19 percent, driven by deposit growth as our clients remain very liquid. In addition, average deposit growth benefited from a flight-to-safety in late 2008. Net interest income also benefited from improved loan spreads on new, renewed and amended facilities. These increases were partially offset by a $3.3 billion, or one percent, decline in average loan balances due to decreased client demand as clients are deleveraging and capital markets began to open up so that corporate clients could access other funding sources. In addition, net interest income was negatively impacted by a lower net interest income allocation from ALM activities and increased nonperforming loans. Noninterest income increased $5.7 billion, or 95 percent, to $11.8 billion, mainly driven by the $3.8 billion pre-tax gain related to the contribution of the merchant processing business into a joint venture, higher investment banking income and service charges. Investment banking income increased $1.7 billion due to the acquisition of Merrill Lynch and strong growth in debt and equity capital markets fees. Service charges increased $721 million, or 22 percent, driven by the Merrill Lynch acquisition and the impact of fees charged for services provided to the merchant processing joint venture. All other income increased $3.3 billion compared to the prior year from the gain related to the contribution of the merchant processing business. All other income also includes our proportionate share of the joint venture net income, where prior to formation of the joint venture these activities were reflected in card income. In addition, noninterest income benefited in 2008 from Global Banking share of the Visa IPO gain. The provision for credit losses increased $5.7 billion to $8.8 billion in 2009 compared to 2008 primarily driven by higher net charge-offs and reserve additions in the commercial real estate and commercial domestic portfolios resulting from deterioration across a broad range of property types, industries and borrowers. Noninterest expense increased $2.9 billion, or 43 percent, to $9.5 billion, primarily attributable to the Merrill Lynch acquisition and higher FDIC insurance and special assessment costs. These items were partially offset by a reduction in certain merchant-related expenses that are now incurred by the joint venture and a change in compensation that delivers a greater portion of incentive pay over time. In addition, noninterest expense in 2008 also included benefits associated with the Visa IPO. Global Banking Revenue Global Banking evaluates its revenue from two primary client views, global commercial banking and global corporate and investment banking. Global commercial banking primarily includes revenue related to our commercial and business banking clients who are generally defined as companies with sales between $2 million and $2 billion including middle-market and multinational clients as well as commercial real estate clients. Global Bank of America 2009 33 Table of Contents corporate and investment banking primarily includes revenue related to our large corporate clients including multinationals which are generally defined as companies with sales in excess of $2 billion. Additionally, global corporate and investment banking revenue also includes debt and equity underwriting and merger-related advisory services (net of revenue sharing primarily with Global Markets ). The following table presents further detail regarding Global Banking revenue. (Dollars in millions) 2009 2008 Global Banking revenue Global commercial banking $ 15,209 $ 11,362 Global corporate and investment banking 7,826 5,434 Total Global Banking revenue $ 23,035 $ 16,796 Global Banking revenue increased $6.2 billion to $23.0 billion in 2009 compared to 2008. Global Banking revenue consists of credit-related revenue derived from lending-related products and services, treasury services-related revenue primarily from capital and treasury management, and investment banking income. Global commercial banking revenue increased $3.8 billion, or 34 percent, primarily driven by the gain from the contribution of the merchant processing business to the joint venture. Credit-related revenue within global commercial banking increased $960 million to $6.7 billion due to improved loan spreads on new, renewed and amended facilities and the Merrill Lynch acquisition. Average loans and leases decreased $3.7 billion to $219.0 billion as increased balances due to the Merrill Lynch acquisition were more than offset by reduced client demand. Treasury services-related revenue within global commercial banking increased $2.9 billion to $8.5 billion driven by the $3.8 billion gain related to the contribution of the merchant services business to the joint venture, partially offset by lower net interest income and the absence of the 2008 gain associated with the Visa IPO. Average treasury services deposit balances increased $22.7 billion to $130.9 billion driven by clients managing their balances. Global corporate and investment banking revenue increased $2.4 billion in 2009 compared to 2008 driven primarily by the Merrill Lynch acquisition which resulted in increased debt and equity capital markets fees, and higher net interest income due mainly to growth in average deposits. Credit-related revenue within global corporate and investment banking increased $387 million to $2.9 billion in 2009 compared to 2008 driven by improved loan spreads and the Merrill Lynch acquisition, partially offset by the adverse impact of increased nonperforming loans and the higher cost of credit hedging. Average loans and leases remained essentially flat as reduced demand offset the impact of the Merrill Lynch acquisition. Treasury services-related revenue within global corporate and investment banking decreased $438 million to $2.5 billion in 2009 driven by lower net interest income, service fees and card income. Average deposit balances increased $11.1 billion to $80.4 billion during 2009 primarily due to clients managing their balances. Investment Banking Income Product specialists within Global Markets work closely with Global Banking on underwriting and distribution of debt and equity securities and certain other products. To reflect the efforts of Global Markets and Global Banking in servicing our clients with the best product capabilities, we allocate revenue to the two segments based on relative contribution. Therefore, to provide a complete discussion of our consolidated investment banking income, we have included the following table that presents total investment banking income for the Corporation. (Dollars in millions) 2009 2008 Investment banking income Advisory (1) $ 1,167 $ 546 Debt issuance 3,124 1,539 Equity issuance 1,964 624 6,255 2,709 Offset for intercompany fees (2) (704 ) (446 ) Total investment banking income $ 5,551 $ 2,263 (1) Advisory includes fees on debt and equity advisory, and merger and acquisitions. (2) The offset to fees paid on the Corporation transactions. Investment banking income increased $3.3 billion to $5.6 billion in 2009 compared to 2008. The increase was largely due to the Merrill Lynch acquisition and favorable market conditions for debt and equity issuances. Debt issuance fees increased $1.6 billion due primarily to leveraged finance and investment grade bond issuances. Equity issuance fees increased $1.3 billion as we benefited from the increased size of the investment banking platform. Advisory fees increased $621 million attributable to the larger advisory platform partially offset by decreased merger and acquisitions activity. 34 Bank of America 2009 Table of Contents Global Markets (Dollars in millions) 2009 2008 Net interest income (1) $ 6,120 $ 5,151 Noninterest income: Investment and brokerage services 2,552 752 Investment banking income 2,850 1,337 Trading account profits (losses) 11,675 (5,809 ) All other income (loss) (2,571 ) (5,262 ) Total noninterest income (loss) 14,506 (8,982 ) Total revenue, net of interest expense 20,626 (3,831 ) Provision for credit losses 400 (50 ) Noninterest expense 10,042 3,906 Income (loss) before income taxes 10,184 (7,687 ) Income tax expense (benefit) (1) 3,007 (2,771 ) Net income (loss) $ 7,177 $ (4,916 ) Return on average equity 23.33 % n/m Efficiency ratio (1) 48.68 n/m Balance Sheet Average Total trading-related assets ( 2 ) $ 507,648 $ 338,074 Total market-based earning assets 481,542 360,667 Total earning assets 490,406 366,195 Total assets 656,621 427,734 Allocated equity 30,765 12,839 Year end Total trading-related assets (2) $ 411,212 $ 244,174 Total market-based earning assets 404,467 237,452 Total earning assets 409,717 243,275 Total assets 538,456 306,693 (1) FTE basis (2) Includes assets which are not considered earning assets (i.e., derivative assets). n/m = not meaningful Global Markets provides financial products, advisory services, financing, securities clearing, settlement and custody services globally to our institutional investor clients in support of their investing and trading activities. We also work with our commercial and corporate clients to provide debt and equity underwriting and distribution capabilities and risk management products using interest rate, equity, credit, currency and commodity derivatives, foreign exchange, fixed income and mortgage-related products. The business may take positions in these products and participate in market-making activities dealing in government securities, equity and equity-linked securities, high-grade and high-yield corporate debt securities, commercial paper, MBS and asset-backed securities (ABS). Underwriting debt and equity, securities research and certain market-based activities are executed through our global broker/dealer affiliates which are our primary dealers in several countries. Global Markets is a leader in the global distribution of fixed income, currency and energy commodity products and derivatives. Global Markets also has one of the largest equity trading operations in the world and is a leader in the origination and distribution of equity and equity-related products. Net income increased $12.1 billion to $7.2 billion in 2009 compared to a loss of $4.9 billion in 2008 as increased noninterest income driven by trading account profits was partially offset by higher noninterest expense. Net interest income, almost all of which is market-based, increased $969 million to $6.1 billion due to growth in average market-based earning assets which increased $120.9 billion or 34 percent, driven primarily by the Merrill Lynch acquisition. Noninterest income increased $23.5 billion due to the Merrill Lynch acquisition, favorable core trading results and decreased write-downs on legacy assets partially offset by negative credit valuation adjustments on derivative liabilities due to improvement in our credit spreads in 2009. Noninterest expense increased $6.1 billion, largely attributable to the Merrill Lynch acquisition. This increase was partially offset by a change in compensation that delivers a greater portion of incentive pay over time. Sales and Trading Revenue Global Markets revenue is primarily derived from sales and trading and investment banking activities which are shared between Global Markets and Global Banking . Global Banking originates certain deal-related transactions with our corporate and commercial clients that are executed and distributed by Global Markets . In order to reflect the relative contribution of each business segment, a revenue-sharing agreement has been implemented which attributes revenue accordingly (see page 34 for a discussion of investment banking fees on a consolidated basis). In addition, certain gains and losses related to write-downs on legacy assets and select trading results are also allocated or shared between Global Markets and Global Banking . Therefore, in order to provide a complete discussion of our sales and trading revenue, the following table and related discussion present total sales and trading revenue for the consolidated Corporation. Sales and trading revenue is segregated into fixed income (investment and noninvestment grade corporate debt obligations, commercial mortgage-backed securities (CMBS), residential mortgage-backed securities (RMBS) and CDOs), currencies (interest rate and foreign exchange contracts), commodities (primarily futures, forwards, swaps and options) and equity income from equity-linked derivatives and cash equity activity. (Dollars in millions) 2009 2008 Sales and trading revenue (1, 2) Fixed income, currencies and commodities (FICC) $ 12,727 $ (7,625 ) Equity income 4,901 743 Total sales and trading revenue $ 17,628 $ (6,882 ) (1) Includes $356 million and $257 million of net interest income on a FTE basis for 2009 and 2008. (2) Includes $1.1 billion and $1.2 billion of write-downs on legacy assets that were allocated to Global Banking for 2009 and 2008. Sales and trading revenue increased $24.5 billion to $17.6 billion in 2009 compared to a loss of $6.9 billion in 2008 due to the addition of Merrill Lynch and the improving economy. Write-downs on legacy assets in 2009 were $3.8 billion with $2.7 billion included in Global Markets as compared to $10.5 billion in 2008 with $9.3 billion recorded in Global Markets . Further, we recorded negative net credit valuation adjustments on derivative liabilities of $801 million resulting from improvements in our credit spreads in 2009 compared to a gain of $354 million in 2008. FICC revenue increased $20.4 billion to $12.7 billion in 2009 compared to 2008 primarily driven by credit and structured products which continued to benefit from improved market liquidity and tighter credit spreads as well as new issuance capabilities. During 2009, we incurred $2.2 billion of losses resulting from our CDO exposure which includes our super senior, warehouse, sales and trading positions, hedging activities and counterparty credit risk valuations. This compares to $4.8 billion in CDO-related losses for 2008. Included in the above losses were $910 million and $1.1 billion of losses in 2009 and 2008 related to counterparty risk on our CDO-related exposure. Also included in the above losses were other-than-temporary impairment charges of $1.2 billion in 2009 compared to $3.3 billion in 2008 related to CDOs and retained positions classified as AFS debt securities. See the following detailed CDO exposure discussion. During 2009 we recorded $1.6 billion of losses, net of hedges, on CMBS funded debt and forward finance commitments compared to losses of $944 million in 2008. These losses were concentrated in the more difficult to hedge floating-rate debt. In addition, we recorded $670 million in losses associated with equity investments we made in acquisition-related financing transactions compared to $545 million in losses in the prior year. At December 31, 2009 and 2008, we held $5.3 billion and $6.9 billion of funded and unfunded CMBS exposure of which $4.4 billion and $6.0 billion were primarily floating-rate Bank of America 2009 35 Table of Contents acquisition-related financings to major, well-known operating companies. CMBS exposure decreased as $4.1 billion of funded CMBS debt acquired in the Merrill Lynch acquisition was partially offset by a transfer of $3.8 billion of CMBS funded debt to commercial loans held for investment as we plan to hold these positions and, to a lesser extent, by loan sales and paydowns. We incurred losses in 2009 on our leveraged loan exposures of $286 million compared to $1.1 billion in 2008. At December 31, 2009, the carrying value of our leveraged funded positions held for distribution was $2.4 billion, which included $1.2 billion from the Merrill Lynch acquisition, compared to $2.8 billion at December 31, 2008, which did not include Merrill Lynch. At December 31, 2009, 99 percent of the carrying value of the leveraged funded positions was senior secured. We recorded a loss of $100 million on auction rate securities (ARS) in 2009 compared to losses of $898 million in 2008 which reflects stabilizing valuations on ARS during the year. We have agreed to purchase ARS at par from certain customers in connection with an agreement with federal and state securities regulators. During 2009, we purchased a net $3.8 billion of ARS from our customers and at December 31, 2009, our outstanding buyback commitment was $291 million. Equity products sales and trading revenue increased $4.2 billion to $4.9 billion in 2009 compared to 2008 driven by the addition of Merrill Lynch trading and financing platforms. Collateralized Debt Obligation Exposure CDO vehicles hold diversified pools of fixed income securities and issue multiple tranches of debt securities including commercial paper, mezzanine and equity securities. Our CDO exposure can be divided into funded and unfunded super senior liquidity commitment exposure, other super senior exposure (i.e., cash positions and derivative contracts), warehouse, and sales and trading positions. For more information on our CDO liquidity commitments, see Note 9 Variable Interest Entities to the Consolidated Financial Statements. Super senior exposure represents the most senior class of commercial paper or notes that are issued by the CDO vehicles. These financial instruments benefit from the subordination of all other securities issued by the CDO vehicles. As presented in the following table, at December 31, 2009, our hedged and unhedged super senior CDO exposure before consideration of insurance, net of write-downs was $3.6 billion. Super Senior Collateralized Debt Obligation Exposure December 31, 2009 (Dollars in millions) Subprime ( 1 ) Retained Positions Total Subprime Non-Subprime ( 2 ) Total Unhedged $ 938 $ 528 $ 1,466 $ 839 $ 2,305 Hedged ( 3 ) 661 661 652 1,313 Total $ 1,599 $ 528 $ 2,127 $ 1,491 $ 3,618 (1) Classified as subprime when subprime consumer real estate loans make up at least 35 percent of the original net exposure value of the underlying collateral. (2) Includes highly rated collateralized loan obligations and CMBS super senior exposure. (3) Hedged amounts are presented at carrying value before consideration of the insurance. We value our CDO structures using the average of all prices obtained from either external pricing services or offsetting trades for approximately 89 percent and 77 percent of the CDO exposure and related retained positions. The majority of the remaining positions where no pricing quotes were available were valued using matrix pricing and projected cash flows. Unrealized losses recorded in accumulated OCI on super senior cash positions and retained positions from liquidated CDOs in aggregate increased $88 million during 2009 to $104 million at December 31, 2009. At December 31, 2009, total subprime super senior unhedged exposure of $1.466 billion was carried at 15 percent and the $839 million of non-subprime unhedged exposure was carried at 51 percent of their original net exposure amounts. Net hedged subprime super senior exposure of $661 million was carried at 13 percent and the $652 million of hedged non-subprime super senior exposure was carried at 64 percent of its original net exposure. The following table presents the carrying values of our subprime net exposures including subprime collateral content and percentages of certain vintages.

Monolines provided $3.8 billion of the purchased insurance in the form of CDS, total return swaps or financial guarantees. In addition, we held collateral in the form of cash and marketable securities of $1.1 billion related to our non-monoline purchased insurance. In the case of default, we look to the underlying securities and then to recovery on purchased insurance. The table below provides notional, receivable, counterparty credit valuation adjustment and gains (write-downs) on insurance purchased from monolines. Credit Default Swaps with Monoline Financial Guarantors December 31, 2009 (Dollars in millions) Super Senior CDOs Other Guaranteed Positions Total Notional $ 3,757 $ 38,834 $ 42,591 Mark-to-market or guarantor receivable $ 2,833 $ 8,256 $ 11,089 Credit valuation adjustment (1,873 ) (4,132 ) (6,005 ) Total $ 960 $ 4,124 $ 5,084 Credit valuation adjustment % 66 % 50 % 54 % (Write-downs) gains during 2009 $ (961 ) $ 98 $ (863 ) Monoline wrap protection on our super senior CDOs had a notional value of $3.8 billion at December 31, 2009, with a receivable of $2.8 billion and a counterparty credit valuation adjustment of $1.9 billion, or 66 percent. During 2009, we recorded $961 million of counterparty credit risk-related write-downs on these positions. At December 31, 2008, the monoline wrap on our super senior CDOs had a notional value of $2.8 billion, with a receivable of $1.5 billion and a counterparty credit valuation adjustment of $1.1 billion, or 72 percent. In addition to the monoline financial guarantor exposure related to super senior CDOs, we had $38.8 billion of notional exposure to monolines that predominantly hedge corporate collateralized loan obligation and CDO exposure as well as CMBS, RMBS and other ABS cash and synthetic exposures that were acquired from Merrill Lynch. At December 31, 2008, the monoline wrap on our other guaranteed positions was $5.9 billion of notional exposure. Mark-to-market monoline derivative credit exposure was $8.3 billion at December 31, 2009 compared to $694 million at December 31, 2008. This increase was driven by the addition of Merrill Lynch exposures as well as credit deterioration related to underlying counterparties, partially offset by positive valuation adjustments on legacy assets and terminated monoline contracts. At December 31, 2009, the counterparty credit valuation adjustment related to non-super senior CDO monoline derivative exposure was $4.1 billion which reduced our net mark-to-market exposure to $4.1 billion. We do not hold collateral against these derivative exposures. Also, during 2009 we recognized gains of $113 million for counterparty credit risk related to these positions. With the Merrill Lynch acquisition, we acquired a loan with a carrying value of $4.4 billion as of December 31, 2009 that is collateralized by U.S. super senior ABS CDOs. Merrill Lynch originally provided financing to the borrower for an amount equal to approximately 75 percent of the fair value of the collateral. The loan has full recourse to the borrower and all scheduled payments on the loan have been received. Events of default under the loan are customary events of default, including failure to pay interest when due and failure to pay principal at maturity.

Our clients have access to a range of services offered through three primary businesses: MLGWM; U.S. Trust, Bank of America Private Wealth Management (U.S. Trust); and Columbia . The results of the Retirement & Philanthropic Services business, the Corporation approximate 34 percent economic ownership interest in BlackRock and other miscellaneous items are included in Other within GWIM . As part of the Merrill Lynch acquisition, we added its financial advisors and an economic ownership interest of approximately 50 percent in BlackRock, a publicly traded investment management company. During 2009, BlackRock completed its purchase of Barclays Global Investors, an asset management business, from Barclays PLC which had the effect of diluting our ownership interest in BlackRock and, for accounting purposes, was treated as a sale of a portion of our ownership interest. As a result, upon the closing of this transaction, the Corporation economic ownership interest in BlackRock was reduced to approximately 34 percent and we recorded a pre-tax gain of $1.1 billion. Net income increased $1.1 billion, or 78 percent, to $2.5 billion as higher total revenue was partially offset by increases in noninterest expense and provision for credit losses. Net interest income increased $767 million, or 16 percent, to $5.6 billion primarily due to the acquisition of Merrill Lynch partially offset by a lower net interest income allocation from ALM activities and the impact of the migration of client balances during 2009 to Deposits and Home Loans & Insurance . GWIM average loan and deposit growth benefited from the acquisition of Merrill Lynch and the shift of client assets from off-balance sheet (e.g., money market funds) to on-balance sheet products (e.g., deposits) partially offset by the net migration of customer relationships. A more detailed discussion regarding migrated customer relationships and related balances is provided in the following MLGWM discussion. Noninterest income increased $9.5 billion to $12.6 billion primarily due to higher investment and brokerage services income driven by the Merrill Lynch acquisition, the $1.1 billion gain on our investment in BlackRock and the lower level of support provided to certain cash funds partially offset by the impact of lower average equity market levels and net outflows primarily in the cash complex. Provision for credit losses increased $397 million, or 60 percent, to $1.1 billion, reflecting the weak economy during 2009 which drove higher net charge-offs in the consumer real estate and commercial portfolios including a single large commercial charge-off. Noninterest expense increased $8.2 billion to $13.1 billion driven by the addition of Merrill Lynch and higher FDIC insurance and special assessment costs partially offset by lower revenue-related expenses. Client Assets The following table presents client assets which consist of AUM, client brokerage assets, assets in custody and client deposits. Client Assets December 31 (Dollars in millions) 2009 2008 Assets under management $ 749,852 $ 523,159 Client brokerage assets (1) 1,270,461 172,106 Assets in custody 274,472 133,726 Client deposits 224,840 176,186 Less: Client brokerage assets and assets in custody included in assets under management (346,682 ) (87,519 ) Total net client assets $ 2,172,943 $ 917,658 (1) Client brokerage assets include non-discretionary brokerage and fee-based assets. The increase in net client assets was driven by the acquisition of Merrill Lynch and higher equity market values at December 31, 2009 compared to 2008 partially offset by outflows that primarily occurred in cash and money market assets due to increasing interest rate pressure. Merrill Lynch Global Wealth Management Effective January 1, 2009, as a result of the Merrill Lynch acquisition, we combined the Merrill Lynch wealth management business and our former Premier Banking & Investments business to form MLGWM . MLGWM provides a high-touch client experience through a network of approximately 15,000 client-facing financial advisors to our affluent customers with a personal wealth profile of at least $250,000 of investable assets. The addition of Merrill Lynch created one of the largest financial advisor networks in the world. Merrill Lynch added $10.3 billion in revenue and $1.6 billion in net income during 2009. Total client balances in MLGWM , which include deposits, AUM, client brokerage assets and other assets in custody, were $1.4 trillion at December 31, 2009. MLGWM includes the impact of migrating customers and their related deposit and loan balances to or from Deposits and Home Loans & Insurance . As of the date of migration, the associated net interest income, noninterest income and noninterest expense are recorded in the segment to which the customers migrated. During 2009, total deposits of $43.4 billion were migrated to Deposits from MLGWM. Conversely, during 2008, total deposits of $20.5 billion were migrated from Deposits to MLGWM. During 2009 and 2008, total loans of $16.6 billion and $1.7 billion were migrated from MLGWM, of which $11.5 billion and $1.6 billion were migrated to Home Loans & Insurance. These changes in 2009 were mainly due to client segmentation threshold changes resulting from the Merrill Lynch acquisition. Bank of America 2009 39 Table of Contents Net income increased $271 million, or 22 percent, to $1.5 billion as increases in noninterest income and net interest income were partially offset by higher noninterest expense. Net interest income increased $1.4 billion, or 42 percent, to $4.6 billion driven by higher average deposit and loan balances due to the acquisition of Merrill Lynch partially offset by a lower net interest income allocation from ALM activities, the impact of migration to Deposits and Home Loans & Insurance , and spread compression on deposits. Noninterest income rose $6.8 billion to $7.8 billion due to an increase in investment and brokerage services income of $5.1 billion driven by the acquisition of Merrill Lynch. Provision for credit losses increased $58 million, or 10 percent, to $619 million primarily driven by increased credit costs related to the consumer real estate portfolio reflecting the weak housing market. Noninterest expense increased $7.6 billion to $9.4 billion driven by the acquisition of Merrill Lynch. In addition, noninterest expense was adversely impacted by higher FDIC insurance and special assessment costs. U.S. Trust, Bank of America Private Wealth Management U.S. Trust provides comprehensive wealth management solutions to wealthy and ultra-wealthy clients with investable assets of more than $3 million. In addition, U.S. Trust provides resources and customized solutions to meet clients wealth structuring, investment management, trust and banking needs as well as specialty asset management services (oil and gas, real estate, farm and ranch, timberland, private businesses and tax advisory). Clients also benefit from access to resources available through the Corporation including capital markets products, large and complex financing solutions, and our extensive banking platform. Net income decreased $490 million, or 74 percent, to $174 million driven by higher provision for credit losses and lower net interest income. Net interest income decreased $209 million, or 13 percent, to $1.4 billion due to a lower net interest income allocation from ALM activities partially offset by the shift of client assets from off-balance sheet (e.g., money market funds) to on-balance sheet products (e.g., deposits). Noninterest income decreased $116 million, or eight percent, to $1.3 billion driven by lower investment and brokerage services income due to lower valuations in the equity markets and a decline in transactional revenues offset by the addition of the Merrill Lynch trust business and lower losses related to ARS. Provision for credit losses increased $339 million to $442 million driven by higher net charge-offs, including a single large commercial charge-off, and higher reserve additions in the commercial and consumer real estate portfolios. Noninterest expense increased $114 million, or six percent, to $1.9 billion due to higher FDIC insurance and special assessment costs and the addition of the Merrill Lynch trust business which were partially offset by cost containment strategies and lower revenue-related expenses. Columbia Management Columbia is an asset management business serving the needs of both institutional clients and individual customers. Columbia provides asset management products and services including mutual funds and separate accounts. Columbia mutual fund offerings provide a broad array of investment strategies and products including equity, fixed income (taxable and nontaxable) and money market (taxable and nontaxable) funds. Columbia distributes its products and services to institutional clients and individuals directly through MLGWM, U.S. Trust, Global Banking and nonproprietary channels including other brokerage firms. During 2009, the Corporation reached an agreement to sell the long-term asset management business of Columbia to Ameriprise Financial, Inc., for consideration of approximately $900 million to $1.2 billion subject to certain adjustments including, among other factors, AUM net flows. This includes the management of Columbia equity and fixed income mutual funds and separate accounts. The transaction is expected to close in the second quarter of 2010, and is subject to regulatory approvals and customary closing conditions, including fund board, fund shareholder and other required client approvals. Columbia recorded a net loss of $7 million compared to a net loss of $469 million in 2008. Net revenue increased $539 million due to a reduction in losses of $917 million related to support provided to certain cash funds offset by lower investment and brokerage services income of $406 million. The decrease in investment and brokerage services income was driven by the impact of lower average equity market levels and net outflows primarily in the cash complex. Noninterest expense decreased $194 million driven by lower revenue-related expenses, such as lower sub-advisory, distribution and dealer support expenses, and reduced personnel-related expenses. Cash Funds Support Beginning in the second half of 2007, we provided support to certain cash funds managed within Columbia. The funds for which we provided support typically invested in high quality, short-term securities with a portfolio weighted-average maturity of 90 days or less, including securities issued by SIVs and senior debt holdings of financial services companies. Due to market disruptions, certain investments in SIVs and senior debt securities were downgraded by the ratings agencies and experienced a decline in fair value. We entered into capital commitments under which the Corporation provided cash to these funds in the event the net asset value per unit of a fund declined below certain thresholds. All capital commitments to these cash funds have been terminated. In 2009 and 2008, we recorded losses of $195 million and $1.1 billion related to these capital commitments. Additionally, during 2009 and 2008, we purchased $1.8 billion and $1.7 billion of certain investments from the funds. As a result of these purchases, certain cash funds, including the Money Market Funds, managed within Columbia no longer have exposure to SIVs or other troubled assets. At December 31, 2009 and 2008, we held AFS debt securities with a fair value of $902 million and $698 million of which $423 million and $279 million were classified as nonperforming AFS debt securities and had $171 million and $272 million of related unrealized losses recorded in accumulated OCI. The decline in value of these securities was driven by the lack of market liquidity and the overall deterioration of the financial markets. These unrealized losses are recorded in accumulated OCI as we expect to recover the full principal amount of such investments and it is more-likely-than-not that we will not be required to sell the investments prior to recovery. Other Other includes the results of the Retirement & Philanthropic Services business, the Corporation approximately 34 percent economic ownership interest in BlackRock and other miscellaneous items. Our investment in BlackRock is accounted for under the equity method of accounting with our proportionate share of income or loss recorded in equity investment income. Net income increased $868 million to $891 million compared to 2008. The increase was driven by higher noninterest income offset by higher noninterest expense and lower net interest income. Net interest income decreased $406 million due to the funding cost on a management accounting basis for carrying the BlackRock investment. Noninterest income increased $2.4 billion to $2.6 billion due to the addition of the Retirement & Philanthropic Services business from Merrill Lynch and earnings from BlackRock which contributed $1.3 billion during 2009, including the $1.1 billion gain previously mentioned. Noninterest expense increased $624 million to $789 million primarily driven by the addition of the Retirement & Philanthropic Services business from Merrill Lynch. 40 Bank of America 2009 Table of Contents All Other 2009 2008 (Dollars in millions) Reported Basis (1) Securitization Offset (2) As Adjusted Reported Basis (1) Securitization Offset (2) As Adjusted Net interest income (3) $ (6,922 ) $ 9,250 $ 2,328 $ (8,019 ) $ 8,701 $ 682 Noninterest income: Card income (loss) (895 ) 2,034 1,139 2,164 (2,250 ) (86 ) Equity investment income 9,020 9,020 265 265 Gains on sales of debt securities 4,440 4,440 1,133 1,133 All other income (loss) (6,735 ) 115 (6,620 ) (711 ) 219 (492 ) Total noninterest income 5,830 2,149 7,979 2,851 (2,031 ) 820 Total revenue, net of interest expense (1,092 ) 11,399 10,307 (5,168 ) 6,670 1,502 Provision for credit losses (3,431 ) 11,399 7,968 (3,769 ) 6,670 2,901 Merger and restructuring charges (4) 2,721 2,721 935 935 All other noninterest expense 1,997 1,997 189 189 Income (loss) before income taxes (2,379 ) (2,379 ) (2,523 ) (2,523 ) Income tax benefit (3) (2,857 ) (2,857 ) (1,283 ) (1,283 ) Net income (loss) $ 478 $ $ 478 $ (1,240 ) $ $ (1,240 ) (1) Provision for credit losses represents the provision for credit losses in All Other combined with the Global Card Services securitization offset.

Global Card Services is reported on a managed basis which includes a securitization impact adjustment which has the effect of assuming that loans that have been securitized were not sold and presents these loans in a manner similar to the way loans that have not been sold are presented. All Other results include a corresponding securitization offset which removes the impact of these securitized loans in order to present the consolidated results on a GAAP basis (i.e., held basis). See the Global Card Services section beginning on page 29 for information on the Global Card Services managed results. The following All Other discussion focuses on the results on an as adjusted basis excluding the securitization offset. In addition to the securitization offset discussed above, All Other includes our Equity Investments businesses and Other . Equity Investments includes Global Principal Investments, Corporate Investments and Strategic Investments. On January 1, 2009, Global Principal Investments added Merrill Lynch principal investments. The combined business is comprised of a diversified portfolio of investments in private equity, real estate and other alternative investments. These investments are made either directly in a company or held through a fund with related income recorded in equity investment income. Global Principal Investments has unfunded equity commitments amounting to $2.5 billion at December 31, 2009 related to certain of these investments. For more information on these commitments, see Note 14 Commitments and Contingencies to the Consolidated Financial Statements. Corporate Investments primarily includes investments in publicly traded debt and equity securities and funds which are accounted for as AFS marketable equity securities. Strategic Investments includes investments of $9.2 billion in CCB, $5.4 billion in Ita Unibanco Holding S.A. (Ita Unibanco), $2.5 billion in Grupo Financiero Santander, S.A. (Santander) and other investments. Our shares of Ita Unibanco are accounted for as AFS marketable equity securities. Our investment in Santander is accounted for under the equity method of accounting. In 2009, we sold 19.1 billion common shares representing our entire initial investment in CCB for $10.1 billion, resulting in a pre-tax gain of $7.3 billion. During 2008, under the terms of the CCB purchase option, we increased our ownership by purchasing approximately 25.6 billion common shares for $9.2 billion. We continue to hold the shares purchased in 2008. These shares are accounted for at cost, are recorded in other assets and are non-transferable until August 2011. We remain a significant shareholder in CCB with an approximate 11 percent ownership interest and intend to continue the important long-term strategic alliance with CCB originally entered into in 2005. As part of this alliance, we expect to continue to provide advice and assistance to CCB. Bank of America 2009 41 Table of Contents The following table presents the components of All Other equity investment income and reconciliation to the total consolidated equity investment income for 2009 and 2008 and also All Other equity investments at December 31, 2009 and 2008. Equity Investment Income (Dollars in millions) 2009 2008 Global Principal Investments $ 1,222 $ (84 ) Corporate Investments (88 ) (520 ) Strategic and other investments 7,886 869 Total equity investment income included in All Other 9,020 265 Total equity investment income included in the business segments 994 274 Total consolidated equity investment income $ 10,014 $ 539 Equity Investments December 31 2009 2008 Global Principal Investments $ 14,071 $ 3,812 Corporate Investments 2,731 2,583 Strategic and other investments 17,860 25,027 Total equity investments included in All Other $ 34,662 $ 31,422 Other includes the residential mortgage portfolio associated with ALM activities, the residual impact of the cost allocation processes, merger and restructuring charges, intersegment eliminations and the results of certain businesses that are expected to be or have been sold or are in the process of being liquidated. Other also includes certain amounts associated with ALM activities, including the residual impact of funds transfer pricing allocation methodologies, amounts associated with the change in the value of derivatives used as economic hedges of interest rate and foreign exchange rate fluctuations, impact of foreign exchange rate fluctuations related to revaluation of foreign currency-denominated debt, fair value adjustments on certain structured notes, certain gains (losses) on sales of whole mortgage loans and gains (losses) on sales of debt securities. In addition, Other includes adjustments to net interest income and income tax expense to remove the FTE effect of items (primarily low-income housing tax credits) that are reported on a FTE basis in the business segments. Other also includes a trust services business which is a client-focused business providing trustee services and fund administration to various financial services companies. First Republic results are also included in Other . First Republic, acquired as part of the Merrill Lynch acquisition, provides personalized, relationship-based banking services including private banking, private business banking, real estate lending, trust, brokerage and investment management. First Republic is a stand-alone bank that operates primarily on the west coast and in the northeast and caters to high-end customers. On October 21, 2009, we reached an agreement to sell First Republic to a number of investors, led by First Republic existing management, Colony Capital, LLC and General Atlantic, LLC. The transaction is expected to close in the second quarter of 2010 subject to regulatory approval. All Other recorded net income of $478 million in 2009 compared to a net loss of $1.2 billion in 2008 as higher total revenue driven by increases in noninterest income, net interest income and an income tax benefit were partially offset by increased provision for credit losses, merger and restructuring charges and all other noninterest expense. Net interest income increased $1.6 billion to $2.3 billion primarily due to unallocated net interest income related to increased liquidity driven in part by capital raises during 2009 and the addition of First Republic in 2009. Noninterest income increased $7.2 billion to $8.0 billion driven by higher equity investment income of $8.8 billion, increased gains on sales of debt securities of $3.3 billion and increased card income of $1.2 billion. These items were partially offset by a decrease in all other income of $6.1 billion. The increase in equity investment income was driven by a $7.3 billion gain on the sale of a portion of our CCB investment and positive valuation adjustments on public and private investments within Global Principal Investments. The decrease in all other income was driven by the $4.9 billion negative credit valuation adjustments on certain Merrill Lynch structured notes due to an improvement in credit spreads during 2009. In addition, we recorded other-than-temporary impairments of $1.6 billion related to non-agency CMOs included in the ALM debt securities portfolio during the year. Provision for credit losses increased $5.1 billion to $8.0 billion. This increase was primarily due to higher credit costs related to our ALM residential mortgage portfolio reflecting deterioration in the housing markets and the impacts of a weak economy. Merger and restructuring charges increased $1.8 billion to $2.7 billion due to the Merrill Lynch and Countrywide acquisitions. The Merrill Lynch acquisition was accounted for in accordance with new accounting guidance for business combinations effective on January 1, 2009 requiring that acquisition-related transaction and restructuring costs be charged to expense. Previously these costs were recorded as an adjustment to goodwill. This change in accounting drove a portion of the increase. We recorded $1.8 billion of merger and restructuring charges during 2009 related to the Merrill Lynch acquisition, the majority of which related to severance and employee-related charges. The remaining merger and restructuring charges related to Countrywide and ABN AMRO North America Holding Company, parent of LaSalle Bank Corporation (LaSalle). For additional information on merger and restructuring charges and systems integrations, see Note 2 Merger and Restructuring Activity to the Consolidated Financial Statements. All other noninterest expense increased $1.8 billion to $2.0 billion due to higher personnel costs and a $425 million charge to pay the U.S. government to terminate its asset guarantee term sheet. Income tax benefit in 2009 increased $1.6 billion primarily as a result of the release of a portion of a valuation allowance that was provided for an acquired capital loss carryforward. Obligations and Commitments We have contractual obligations to make future payments on debt and lease agreements. Additionally, in the normal course of business, we enter into contractual arrangements whereby we commit to future purchases of products or services from unaffiliated parties. Obligations that are legally binding agreements whereby we agree to purchase products or services with a specific minimum quantity defined at a fixed, minimum or variable price over a specified period of time are defined as purchase obligations. Included in purchase obligations are commitments to purchase loans of $9.5 billion and vendor contracts of $9.1 billion. The most significant vendor contracts include communication services, processing services and software contracts. Other long-term liabilities include our contractual funding obligations related to the Qualified Pension Plans, Nonqualified Pension Plans and Postretirement Health and Life Plans (the Plans). Obligations to the Plans are based on the current and projected obligations of the Plans, performance of the Plans assets and any participant contributions, if applicable. During 2009 and 2008, we contributed $414 million and $1.6 billion to the Plans, and we expect to make at least $346 million of contributions during 2010. 42 Bank of America 2009 Table of Contents Table 9 presents total long-term debt and other obligations at December 31, 2009.

The Plans are more fully discussed in Note 17 Employee Benefit Plans to the Consolidated Financial Statements. We enter into commitments to extend credit such as loan commitments, standby letters of credit (SBLCs) and commercial letters of credit to meet the financing needs of our customers. For a summary of the total unfunded, or off-balance sheet, credit extension commitment amounts by expiration date, see the table in Note 14 Commitments and Contingencies to the Consolidated Financial Statements. Regulatory Initiatives On November 12, 2009, the Federal Reserve issued the final rule related to changes to Regulation E and on May 22, 2009, the CARD Act was signed into law. For more information on the impact of these new regulations, see Regulatory Overview on page 17. In December 2009, the Basel Committee on Banking Supervision released consultative documents on both capital and liquidity. In addition, we will begin Basel II parallel implementation during the second quarter of 2010. For more information, see Basel Regulatory Capital Requirements on page 52. On January 21, 2010, the Federal Reserve, Office of the Comptroller of the Currency, FDIC and Office of Thrift Supervision (collectively, joint agencies) issued a final rule regarding risk-based capital and the impact of adoption of new consolidation rules issued by the FASB. The final rule eliminates the exclusion of certain asset-backed commercial paper (ABCP) program assets from risk-weighted assets and provides a reservation of authority to permit the joint agencies to require banks to treat structures that are not consolidated under the accounting standards as if they were consolidated for risk-based capital purposes commensurate with the risk relationship of the bank to the structure. In addition, the final rule allows for an optional delay and phase-in for a maximum of one year for the effect on risk-weighted assets and the regulatory limit on the inclusion of the allowance for loan and lease losses in Tier 2 capital related to the assets that must be consolidated as a result of the accounting change. The transitional relief does not apply to the leverage ratio or to assets in VIEs to which a bank provides implicit support. We have elected to forgo the phase-in period, and accordingly, we consolidated the amounts for regulatory capital purposes as of January 1, 2010. For more information on the impact of this guidance, see Impact of Adopting New Accounting Guidance on Consolidation on page 52. On December 14, 2009, we announced our intention to increase lending to small- and medium-sized businesses to approximately $21 billion in 2010 compared to approximately $16 billion in 2009. This announcement is consistent with the U.S. Treasury initiative, announced as part of the Financial Stability Plan on February 2, 2009, to help increase small business owners access to credit. As part of the initiative, the U.S. Treasury began making direct purchases of up to $15 billion of certain securities backed by Small Business Administration (SBA) loans to improve liquidity in the credit markets and purchasing new securities to ensure that financial institutions feel confident in extending new loans to small businesses. The program also temporarily raises guarantees to up to 90 percent in the SBA loan program and temporarily eliminates certain SBA loan fees. We continue to lend to creditworthy small business customers through small business credit cards, loans and lines of credit products. In response to the economic downturn, the FDIC implemented the Temporary Liquidity Guarantee Program (TLGP) to strengthen confidence and encourage liquidity in the banking system by allowing the FDIC to guarantee senior unsecured debt (e.g., promissory notes, unsubordinated unsecured notes and commercial paper) up to prescribed limits, issued by participating entities beginning on October 14, 2008, and continuing through October 31, 2009. We participated in this program; however, as announced in September 2009, due to improved market liquidity and our ability to issue debt without the FDIC guarantee, we, with the FDIC agreement, exited the program and have stopped issuing FDIC-guaranteed debt. At December 31, 2009, we still had FDIC-guaranteed debt outstanding issued under the TLGP of $44.3 billion. The TLGP also offered the Transaction Account Guarantee Program (TAGP) that guaranteed noninterest-bearing deposit accounts held at participating FDIC-insured institutions on balances in excess of $250,000. We elected to opt out of the six-month extension of the TAGP which extends the program to June 30, 2010. We exited the TAGP effective December 31, 2009. On September 21, 2009, the Corporation reached an agreement to terminate its term sheet with the U.S. government under which the U.S. government agreed in principle to provide protection against the possibility of unusually large losses on a pool of the Corporation financial instruments that were acquired from Merrill Lynch. In connection with the termination of the term sheet, the Corporation paid a total of $425 million to the U.S. government to be allocated among the U.S. Treasury, the Federal Reserve and the FDIC. In addition to exiting the TARP as discussed on page 18, terminating the U.S. Government asset guarantee term sheet and exiting the TLGP, including the TAGP, we have exited or ceased participation in market disruption liquidity programs created by the U.S. government in response to the economic downturn of 2008. We have exited or repaid borrowings under the Term Auction Facility, U.S. Treasury Temporary Liquidity Guarantee Program for Money Market Funds, ABCP Money Market Fund Liquidity Facility, Commercial Paper Federal Funding Facility, Money Market Investor Funding Facility, Term Securities Lending Facility and Primary Dealer Credit Facility. On November 17, 2009, the FDIC issued a final rule that required insured institutions to prepay on December 30, 2009 their estimated Bank of America 2009 43 Table of Contents quarterly risk-based assessments for the fourth quarter of 2009 and for all of 2010, 2011 and 2012. For the fourth quarter of 2009 and for all of 2010, the prepaid assessment rate was based on each institution total base assessment rate for the third quarter of 2009, modified to assume that the assessment rate in effect on September 30, 2009 had been in effect for the entire third quarter of 2009. The prepaid assessment rates for 2011 and 2012 are equal to the modified third quarter 2009 total base assessment rate plus three bps adjusted quarterly for an estimated five percent annual growth rate in the assessment base through the end of 2012. As the prepayment related to future periods, it was recorded in prepaid assets for financial reporting purposes and will be recognized as expense over the coverage period. On May 22, 2009, the FDIC adopted a rule designed to replenish the deposit insurance fund. This rule established a special assessment of five bps on each FDIC-insured depository institution assets minus its Tier 1 capital with a maximum assessment not to exceed 10 bps of an institution domestic deposits. This special assessment was calculated based on asset levels at June 30, 2009, and was collected on September 30, 2009. The Corporation recorded a net charge of $724 million in 2009 in connection with this assessment. Additionally, beginning April 1, 2009, the FDIC increased fees on deposits based on a revised risk-weighted methodology which increased the base assessment rates. Pursuant to the Emergency Economic Stabilization Act of 2008 (EESA), the U.S. Treasury announced the creation of the Financial Stability Plan. This plan outlined a series of key initiatives including a new Capital Assistance Program (CAP) to help ensure that banking institutions have sufficient capital. We, as well as several other large financial institutions, are subject to the Supervisory Capital Assessment Program (SCAP) conducted by federal regulators. The objective of the SCAP is to assess losses that could occur under certain economic scenarios, including economic conditions more severe than anticipated. As a result of the SCAP, in May 2009, federal regulators determined that the Corporation required an additional $33.9 billion of Tier 1 common capital to sustain more severe economic circumstances assuming a more prolonged and deeper recession over a two-year period than the majority of both private and government economists projected. We achieved the increased capital requirement during the first half of 2009 through strategic transactions that increased common capital, including the expected reductions in preferred dividends and related reduction in deferred tax asset disallowances, by approximately $39.7 billion and significantly exceeded the SCAP buffer. This Tier 1 common capital increase resulted from the exchange of approximately $14.8 billion aggregate liquidation preference of non-government preferred shares into approximately 1.0 billion common shares, an at-the-market offering of 1.25 billion common shares for $13.5 billion, a $4.4 billion benefit (including associated tax effects) related to the sale of shares of CCB, a $3.2 billion benefit (net of tax and including an approximate $800 million reduction in goodwill and intangibles) related to the gain from the contribution of our merchant processing business to a joint venture, $1.6 billion due to reduced actual and forecasted preferred dividends throughout 2009 and 2010 related to the exchange of preferred for common shares and a $2.2 billion reduction in the deferred tax asset disallowance for Tier 1 common capital from the preceding items. On March 4, 2009, the U.S. Treasury provided details related to the $75 billion Making Home Affordable program (MHA). The MHA is focused on reducing the number of foreclosures and making it easier for customers to refinance loans. The MHA consists of the Home Affordable Modification Program (HAMP) which provides guidelines on first lien loan modifications, and the Home Affordable Refinance Program (HARP) which provides guidelines for loan refinancing. The HAMP is designed to help at-risk homeowners avoid foreclosure by reducing payments. This program provides incentives to lenders to modify all eligible loans that fall under the guidelines of this program. The HARP is available to approximately four to five million homeowners who have a proven payment history on an existing mortgage owned by the Federal National Mortgage Association (FNMA) or the Federal Home Loan Mortgage Corporation (FHLMC). The HARP is designed to help eligible homeowners refinance their mortgage loans to take advantage of current lower mortgage rates or to refinance adjustable-rate mortgages (ARM) into more stable fixed-rate mortgages. As part of the MHA program, on April 28, 2009, the U.S. government announced intentions to create the second lien modification program (2MP) that will be designed to reduce the monthly payments on qualifying home equity loans and lines of credit under certain conditions, including completion of a HAMP modification on the first mortgage on the property. This program will provide incentives to lenders to modify all eligible loans that fall under the guidelines of this program. On January 26, 2010, we formally announced that we will participate in the 2MP once program details are finalized. We will modify eligible second liens regardless of whether the MHA modified first lien is serviced by Bank of America or another participating servicer. Another addition to the HAMP is the recently announced Home Affordable Foreclosure Alternatives (HAFA) program to assist borrowers with non-retention options instead of foreclosure. The HAFA program provides incentives to lenders to assist all eligible borrowers that fall under the guidelines of this program. Our first goal is to work with the borrower to determine if a loan modification or other homeownership retention solution is available before pursuing non-retention options such as short sales. Short sales are an important option for homeowners who are facing financial difficulty and do not have a viable option to remain in the home. HAFA short sale guidelines are designed to streamline and standardize the process and will be compatible with Bank of America new cooperative short sale program. As of January 2010, approximately 220,000 Bank of America customers were already in a trial-period modification under the MHA program. We will continue to help our customers address financial challenges through these government programs and our own home retention programs. Managing Risk Overview The Corporation risk management infrastructure is evolving to meet the challenges posed by the increased complexity of the financial services industry and markets, by our increased size and global footprint, and by the rapid and significant financial crisis of the past two years. We have redefined our risk framework, articulated a risk appetite approved by the Board of Directors (the Board), and begun the roll out and implementation of our risk plan. While many of these processes, and roles and responsibilities continue to evolve and mature, we will ensure that we continue to enhance our risk management process with a focus on clarity of roles and accountabilities, escalation of issues, aggregation of risk and data across the enterprise, and effective governance characterized by clarity and transparency. Given our wide range of business activities as well as the competitive dynamics, the regulatory environment and the geographic span of such activities, risk taking is an inherent activity for the Corporation. Consequently, we take a comprehensive approach to risk management. Risk management planning is fully integrated with strategic, financial and customer/client planning so that goals and responsibilities are aligned across the organization. Risk is managed in a systematic manner by focusing on the Corporation as a whole and managing risk across the enterprise and within individual business units, products, services and transactions. We maintain a governance structure that delineates the 44 Bank of America 2009 Table of Contents responsibilities for risk management activities, as well as governance and the oversight of those activities, by executive management and the Board. Economic capital is assigned to each business segment using a risk-adjusted methodology incorporating each segment stand-alone credit, market, interest rate and operational risk components, and is used to measure risk-adjusted returns. Executive management assesses, and the Board oversees, the risk-adjusted returns of each business through review and approval of strategic and financial operating plans. By allocating economic capital to and establishing a risk appetite for a line of business, we effectively manage the ability to take on risk. Businesses operate within their credit, market, compliance, and operational risk standards and limits in order to adhere to the risk appetite. These limits are based on analyses of risk and reward in each line of business, and executive management is responsible for tracking and reporting performance measurements as well as any exceptions to guidelines or limits. The Board monitors financial performance, execution of the strategic and financial operating plans, compliance with the risk appetite and the adequacy of internal controls through its committees. Our business exposes us to strategic, credit, market, liquidity, compliance, operational and reputational risk. Strategic risk is the risk that adverse business decisions, ineffective or inappropriate business plans, or failure to respond to changes in the competitive environment, business cycles, customer preferences, product obsolescence, execution and/or other intrinsic risks of business will impact our ability to meet our objectives. Credit risk is the risk of loss arising from a borrower or counterparty inability to meet its obligations. Market risk is the risk that values of assets and liabilities or revenues will be adversely affected by changes in market conditions such as interest rate movements. Liquidity risk is the inability to accommodate liability maturities and deposit withdrawals, fund asset growth and meet contractual obligations through unconstrained access to funding at reasonable market rates. Compliance risk is the risk posed by the failure to manage regulatory, legal and ethical issues that could result in monetary damages, losses or harm to our reputation or image. Operational risk is the risk of loss resulting from inadequate or failed internal processes, people and systems or external events. Reputational risk, the risk that negative publicity will adversely affect the Corporation, is managed as a natural part of managing the other six types of risk. The following sections, Strategic Risk Management on page 47, Liquidity Risk and Capital Management beginning on page 47, Credit Risk Management beginning on page 54, Market Risk Management beginning on page 79, Compliance Risk Management on page 86, and Operational Risk Management beginning on page 86, address in more detail the specific procedures, measures and analyses of the major categories of risk that the Corporation manages. On October 28, 2009, the Board approved the Risk Framework and Risk Appetite Statement for the Corporation. The Risk Framework is designed to be used by our associates to understand risk management activities, including their individual roles and accountabilities. The Risk Framework defines how risk management is integrated into our core business processes, and it defines the risk management governance structure, including management involvement. The risk management responsibilities of the lines of business, Governance and Control functions, and Corporate Audit are also clearly defined. The Risk Framework reflects how the Board-approved risk appetite influences business and risk strategy. The management process (i.e., identify and measure risk, mitigate and control risk, monitor and test risk, and report and review risk) was enhanced for execution across all business activities. The Risk Framework supports the accountability of the Corporation and its associates to ensure the integrity of assets and the quality of earnings. The Risk Appetite Statement defines the parameters under which we will take risk to maximize our long-term results by ensuring the integrity of our assets and the quality of our earnings. Our intent is for our risk appetite to reflect a through the cycle view which will be reviewed and assessed annually. Risk Management Processes and Methods To ensure that our corporate goals and objectives, risk appetite, and business and risk strategies are achieved, we utilize a risk management process that is applied in executing all business activities. All functions and roles fall into one of three categories where risk must be managed. These are lines of business, Governance and Control (Global Risk Management or other support groups) and Corporate Audit. The lines of business are responsible for identifying and managing all existing, reputational and emerging risks in their business units, since this is where most of our risk-taking occurs. Line of business management makes and executes the business plan and is closest to the changing nature of risks and, therefore, we believe is best able to implement procedures and controls that align to policies and limits. Risk self-assessments conducted by the business are used to identify risks and calibrate the severity of potential risk issues. These assessments are reviewed by the lines of business and executive management, including senior Risk executives. To the extent appropriate, the assessments are reviewed by the Board or its committees to ensure appropriate risk management and oversight, and to identify enterprise-wide issues. Our management processes, structures and policies aid us in complying with laws and regulations and provide clear lines for decision-making and accountability. Wherever practical, we attempt to house decision-making authority as close to the transaction as possible while retaining supervisory control functions from both inside and outside of the lines of business. The Governance and Control functions include our Risk Management, Finance, Treasury, Technology and Operations, Human Resources, and Legal functions. These groups are independent of the lines of business and are organized with both line of business-aligned and enterprise-wide functions. The Governance and Control functions are accountable for setting policies, standards and limits according to the Risk Appetite Statement, providing risk reporting and monitoring, and ensuring compliance. For example, in Global Risk Management, a senior risk executive is assigned to each of the lines of business and is responsible for the oversight of all the risks associated with that line of business and ensuring compliance with policies, standards and limits. Enterprise-level risk executives have responsibility to develop and implement the framework for policies and practices to assess and manage enterprise-wide credit, market, compliance and operational risks. Corporate Audit provides an independent assessment of our management and internal control systems through testing of key processes and controls across the organization. Corporate Audit activities are designed to provide reasonable assurance that resources are adequately protected; significant financial, managerial and operating information is materially complete, accurate and reliable; and employees actions are in compliance with the Corporation policies, standards, procedures, and applicable laws and regulations. We use a risk management process, applied across the execution of all business activities, that is designed to identify and measure, mitigate and control, monitor and test, and report and review risks. This process enables us to review risks in an integrated and comprehensive manner and make strategic and business decisions based on that comprehensive view. Corporate goals and objectives and risk appetite are established by executive management, approved by the Board, and are inputs to setting business and risk strategy which guide the execution of business activities. Governance, continuous feedback, and independent testing and validation provide structured controls, reporting and audit of the execution Bank of America 2009 45 Table of Contents of risk processes and business activities. Examples of tools, methods and processes used include: self-assessments conducted by the lines of business in concert with independent risk assessments by Governance and Control (part of identify and measure ); a system of controls and supervision which provides assurance that associates act in accordance with laws, regulations, policies and procedures (part of mitigate and control ); independent testing of control and mitigation plans by Credit Review and Corporate Audit (part of monitor and test ); and a summary risk report which includes key risk metrics that measure the performance of the Corporation against risk limits and the Risk Appetite Statement (part of report and review ). The formal processes used to manage risk represent only one portion of our overall risk management process. Corporate culture and the actions of our associates are also critical to effective risk management. Through our Code of Ethics, we set a high standard for our associates. The Code of Ethics provides a framework for all of our associates to conduct themselves with the highest integrity in the delivery of our products or services to our customers. We instill a risk-conscious culture through communications, training, policies, procedures, and organizational roles and responsibilities. Additionally, we continue to strengthen the linkage between the associate performance management process and individual compensation to encourage associates to work toward enterprise-wide risk goals. Board Oversight The Board oversees management of the Corporation businesses and affairs. In its oversight of the Corporation, the Board goal is to set the tone for the highest ethical standards and performance of our management, associates and the Corporation as a whole. The Board strongly believes that good corporate governance practices are important for successful business performance. Our corporate governance practices are designed to align the interests of the Board and management with those of our stockholders and to promote honesty and integrity throughout the Corporation. Over the past year, we have enhanced our corporate governance practices in many important ways, and we continue to monitor best practices to promote a high level of performance from the Board, management and our associates. The Board has adopted Corporate Governance Guidelines that embody long-standing practices of the Corporation as well as current corporate governance best practices. In 2009, the Board established a special Board committee with five non-management members (the Special Governance Committee ) to review and recommend changes in all aspects of the Board activities. In recognition of the increased complexity of our company following the major acquisitions of Merrill Lynch and Countrywide, and the challenges of the current business environment, the Board has strengthened its membership by appointing new directors who are independent of management and demonstrate significant banking, financial and investment banking expertise. In addition, the Board has assessed and further developed its structures and processes through which it fulfills its oversight role by the following: modifying committee membership and leadership to best leverage the abilities and backgrounds of the Board members; recasting the Asset Quality Committee as a more targeted and focused Credit Committee and establishing the Enterprise Risk Committee such that these two committees, together with the Audit Committee, work in complement to ensure that key aspects of risk, capital and liquidity management are specifically overseen by committees with clear and affirmative oversight responsibilities set forth in their committee charters; working with management and outside regulatory experts to redesign management reports to the Board and committees; periodically reviewing the composition of the Board in light of the Corporation business and structure to identify and nominate director candidates who possess relevant experience, qualifications, attributes and skills to the Board; and enhancing the director orientation process to include, among other changes, increased interaction with executive management and increased focus on key risks. At the Corporation, the Audit, Credit and Enterprise Risk Committees are charged with a majority of the risk oversight responsibilities on behalf of the Board. In 2009, as noted above, the Board recast the Asset Quality Committee as a more targeted and focused Credit Committee and established a new Enterprise Risk Committee. The Credit Committee oversees, among other things, the management of our credit exposures on an enterprise-wide basis, our response to trends affecting those exposures, the adequacy of the allowance for credit losses and our credit related policies. The Enterprise Risk Committee, among other things, oversees our management of and policies and procedures with respect to material risks on an enterprise-wide basis, including market risk, interest rate risk, liquidity risk and reputational risk. It also oversees our capital management and liquidity planning. The Audit Committee retains oversight responsibility for operational risk, the integrity of our consolidated financial statements, compliance, legal risk and overall policies and practices relating to risk management. In addition to the three risk oversight committees, the Compensation and Benefits Committee oversees the Corporation compensation practices in order that they do not encourage unnecessary and excessive risk taking by our associates. The Audit, Credit and Enterprise Risk Committees work in tandem to provide enterprise-wide oversight of the Corporation management and handling of risk. Each of these three committees reports regularly to the Board on risk-related matters within its responsibilities and together this provides the Board with integrated insight about our management of strategic, credit, market, liquidity, compliance, operational and reputational risks. Starting in 2009, the Board formalized its process of approving the Corporation articulation of its risk appetite, which is used internally to help the directors and management understand more clearly the Corporation tolerance for risk in each of the major risk categories, the way those risks are measured and the key controls available that influence the Corporation level of risk-taking. The Board intends to undertake this process annually going forward. The Board also approves, at a high level, following proposal by management, the Corporation framework for managing risk. At meetings of the Board and the Audit, Credit and Enterprise Risk Committees, directors receive updates from management regarding enterprise risk management, including our performance against the identified risk appetite. The Chief Risk Officer, who is responsible for instituting risk management practices that are consistent with our overall business strategy and risk appetite, and the General Counsel, who manages legal risk, both report directly to the Chief Executive Officer and lead management risk and legal risk discussions at Board and committee meetings. In addition, the Corporate General Auditor, who is responsible for assessing the company control environment over significant financial, managerial, and operating information, is independent of management and reports directly to the Audit Committee. The Corporate General Auditor also administratively reports to our Chief Executive Officer. Outside of formal meetings, Board members have regular access to senior executives, including the Chief Risk Officer and the General Counsel. 46 Bank of America 2009 Table of Contents Strategic Risk Management Strategic risk is embedded in every line of business and is part of the other major risk categories (credit, market, liquidity, compliance and operational). It is the risk that results from adverse business decisions, ineffective or inappropriate business plans, or failure to respond to changes in the competitive environment, business cycles, customer preferences, product obsolescence, regulatory environment, business strategy execution, and/or other inherent risks of the business including reputational risk. In the financial services industry, strategic risk is high due to changing customer and regulatory environments. The Corporation appetite for strategic risk is continually assessed within the context of the strategic plan, with strategic risks selectively and carefully taken to maintain relevance in the evolving marketplace. Strategic risk is managed in the context of our overall financial condition and assessed, managed and acted on by the Chief Executive Officer and executive management team. Significant strategic actions, such as material acquisitions or capital actions, are reviewed and approved by the Board. Using a plan developed by management, executive management and the Board approve a strategic plan every two to three years. Annually, executive management develops a financial operating plan and the Board reviews and approves the plan. Executive management, with Board oversight, ensures that the plans are consistent with the Corporation strategic plan, core operating tenets and risk appetite. The following are assessed in their reviews: forecasted earnings and returns on capital; the current risk profile and changes required to support the plan; current capital and liquidity requirements and changes required to support the plan; stress testing results; and other qualitative factors such as market growth rates and peer analysis. Executive management, with Board oversight, performs similar analyses throughout the year, and will define changes to the financial forecast or the risk, capital or liquidity positions as deemed appropriate to balance and optimize between achieving the targeted risk appetite and shareholder returns and maintaining the targeted financial strength. We use proprietary models to measure the capital requirements for credit, country, market, operational and strategic risks. The economic capital assigned to each line of business is based on its unique risk exposures. With oversight by the Board, executive management assesses the risk-adjusted returns of each business in approving strategic and financial operating plans. The businesses use economic capital to define business strategies, price products and transactions, and evaluate client profitability. Liquidity Risk and Capital Management Funding and Liquidity Risk Management We define liquidity risk as the potential inability to meet our contractual and contingent financial obligations, on- or off-balance sheet, as they come due. Our primary liquidity objective is to ensure adequate funding for our businesses throughout market cycles, including during periods of financial stress. To achieve that objective we analyze and monitor our liquidity risk, maintain excess liquidity and access diverse funding sources including our stable deposit base. We define excess liquidity as readily available assets, limited to cash and high-quality liquid unencumbered securities, that we can use to meet our funding requirements as those obligations arise. Global funding and liquidity risk management activities are centralized within Corporate Treasury. We believe that a centralized approach to funding and liquidity risk management enhances our ability to monitor liquidity requirements, maximizes access to funding sources, minimizes borrowing costs and facilitates timely responses to liquidity events. The Board approves the Corporation liquidity policy and contingency funding plan, including establishing liquidity risk tolerance levels. The Asset and Liability Market Risk Committee (ALMRC), in conjunction with the Board and its committees, monitors our liquidity position and reviews the impact of strategic decisions on our liquidity. ALMRC is responsible for managing liquidity risks and ensuring exposures remain within the established tolerance levels. ALMRC delegates additional oversight responsibilities to the Risk Oversight Committee (ROC), which reports to ALMRC. ROC reviews and monitors our liquidity position, cash flow forecasts, stress testing scenarios and results, and implements our liquidity limits and guidelines. For more information, refer to Board Oversight on page 46. Under this governance framework, we have developed the following funding and liquidity risk management practices: Maintain excess liquidity at the parent company and selected subsidiaries, including our bank and broker/dealer subsidiaries Determine what amounts of excess liquidity are appropriate for these entities based on analysis of debt maturities and other potential cash outflows, including those that we may experience during stressed market conditions Diversify funding sources, considering our asset profile and legal entity structure Perform contingency planning Global Excess Liquidity Sources and Other Unencumbered Assets We maintain excess liquidity available to the parent company and selected subsidiaries in the form of cash and high-quality, liquid, unencumbered securities that together serve as our primary means of liquidity risk mitigation. We call these assets our Global Excess Liquidity Sources, and we limit the composition of high-quality, liquid, unencumbered securities to U.S. government securities, U.S. agency securities, U.S. agency MBS and a select group of non-U.S. government securities. We believe we can quickly obtain cash for these securities, even in stressed market conditions, through repurchase agreements or outright sales. We hold these assets in entities that allow us to meet the liquidity requirements of our global businesses and we consider the impact of potential regulatory, tax, legal and other restrictions that could limit the transferability of funds among entities. Our Global Excess Liquidity Sources totaled $214 billion at December 31, 2009 and were maintained as presented in the table below. Table 10 Global Excess Liquidity Sources December 31, 2009 (Dollars in billions) Parent company $ 99 Bank subsidiaries 89 Broker/dealers 26 Total global excess liquidity sources $ 214 As noted above, the excess liquidity available to the parent company is held in cash and high-quality, liquid, unencumbered securities and totaled $99 billion at December 31, 2009. Typically, parent company cash is deposited overnight with Bank of America, N.A. Our bank subsidiaries excess liquidity sources at December 31, 2009 consisted of $89 billion in cash on deposit at the Federal Reserve and high-quality, liquid, unencumbered securities. These amounts are distinct from the cash deposited by the parent company, as previously described. In addition to their excess liquidity sources, our bank sub - - Bank of America 2009 47 Table of Contents sidiaries hold significant amounts of other unencumbered securities that we believe they could also use to generate liquidity, such as investment grade ABS and municipal bonds. Another way our bank subsidiaries can generate incremental liquidity is by pledging a range of other unencumbered loans and securities to certain FHLBs and the Federal Reserve Discount Window. The cash we could have obtained at December 31, 2009 by borrowing against this pool of specifically identified eligible assets was approximately $187 billion. We have established operational procedures to enable us to borrow against these assets, including regularly monitoring our total pool of eligible loan and securities collateral. Due to regulatory restrictions, liquidity generated by the bank subsidiaries may only be used to fund obligations within the bank subsidiaries and may not be transferred to the parent company or other nonbank subsidiaries. Our broker/dealer subsidiaries excess liquidity sources at December 31, 2009 consisted of $26 billion in cash and high-quality, liquid, unencumbered securities. Our broker/dealers also held significant amounts of other unencumbered securities we believe they could utilize to generate additional liquidity, including investment grade corporate bonds, ABS and equities. Liquidity held in a broker/dealer subsidiary may only be available to meet the liquidity requirements of that entity and may not be transferred to the parent company or other subsidiaries. Time to Required Funding and Stress Modeling We use a variety of metrics to determine the appropriate amounts of excess liquidity to maintain at the parent company and our bank and broker/dealer subsidiaries. The primary metric we use to evaluate the appropriate level of excess liquidity at the parent company is Time to Required Funding. This debt coverage measure indicates the number of months that the parent company can continue to meet its unsecured contractual obligations as they come due using only its Global Excess Liquidity Sources without issuing any new debt or accessing any additional liquidity sources. We define unsecured contractual obligations for purposes of this metric as senior or subordinated debt maturities issued or guaranteed by Bank of America Corporation or Merrill Lynch & Co., Inc., including certain unsecured debt instruments, primarily structured notes, which we may be required to settle for cash prior to maturity. ALMRC has established a minimum target for Time to Required Funding of 21 months. Time to Required Funding was 25 months at December 31, 2009. We also utilize liquidity stress models to assist us in determining the appropriate amounts of excess liquidity to maintain at the parent company and our bank and broker/dealer subsidiaries. We use these models to analyze our potential contractual and contingent cash outflows and liquidity requirements under a range of scenarios with varying levels of severity and time horizons. These scenarios incorporate market-wide and Corporation-specific events, including potential credit rating downgrades for the parent company and our subsidiaries. We consider and utilize scenarios based on historical experience, regulatory guidance, and both expected and unexpected future events. We consider all sources of funds that we could access during each stress scenario and focus particularly on matching available sources with corresponding liquidity requirements by legal entity. We also use the stress modeling results to manage our asset-liability profile and establish limits and guidelines on certain funding sources and businesses. Diversified Funding Sources We fund our assets primarily with a mix of deposits and secured and unsecured liabilities through a globally coordinated funding strategy. We diversify our funding globally across products, programs, markets, currencies and investor bases. We fund a substantial portion of our lending activities through our deposit base which was $992 billion at December 31, 2009. Deposits are primarily generated by our Deposits, Global Banking and GWIM segments. These deposits are diversified by clients, product types and geography. Domestic deposits may be insured by the FDIC. We consider a substantial portion of our deposits to be a stable, low-cost and consistent source of funding. We believe this deposit funding is generally less sensitive to interest rate changes, market volatility or changes in our credit ratings than wholesale funding sources. Certain consumer lending activities, primarily in our banking subsidiaries, may be funded through securitizations. Included in these consumer lending activities are the extension of mortgage, credit card, auto loans, home equity loans and lines of credit. If securitization markets are not available to us on favorable terms, we typically finance these loans with deposits or with wholesale borrowings. For additional information on securitizations see Note 8 Securitizations to the Consolidated Financial Statements. Our trading activities are primarily funded on a secured basis through repurchase and securities lending agreements. Due to the underlying collateral, we believe this financing is more cost-efficient and less sensitive to changes in our credit ratings than unsecured financing. Repurchase agreements are generally short-term and often occur overnight. Disruptions in secured financing markets for financial institutions have occurred in prior market cycles which resulted in adverse changes in terms or significant reductions in the availability of such financing. We manage the liquidity risks arising from secured funding by sourcing funding globally from a diverse group of counterparties, providing a range of securities collateral and pursuing longer durations when we finance lower-quality assets. Unsecured debt, both short- and long-term, is also an important source of funding. We may issue unsecured debt through syndicated U.S. registered offerings, U.S. registered and unregistered medium-term note programs, non-U.S. medium-term note programs, non-U.S. private placements, U.S. and non-U.S. commercial paper and through other methods. We distribute a significant portion of our debt offerings through our retail and institutional sales forces to a large, diversified global investor base. Maintaining relationships with our investors is an important aspect of our funding strategy. We may also make markets in our debt instruments to provide liquidity for investors. We issue the majority of our unsecured debt at the parent company and Bank of America, N.A. During 2009, we issued $30.2 billion and $10.5 billion of long-term senior unsecured debt at the parent company and Bank of America N.A. The primary benefits of this centralized financing strategy include greater control, reduced funding costs, wider name recognition by investors and greater flexibility to meet the variable funding requirements of subsidiaries. Where regulations, time zone differences, or other business considerations make parent company funding impractical, certain other subsidiaries may issue their own debt. We issue unsecured debt in a variety of maturities and currencies to achieve cost-efficient funding and to maintain an appropriate maturity profile. While the cost and availability of unsecured funding may be negatively impacted by general market conditions or by matters specific to the financial services industry or Bank of America, we seek to mitigate refinancing risk by actively managing the amount of our borrowings that we anticipate will mature within any month or quarter. At December 31, 2009, our long-term debt was issued in the currencies presented in the following table. 48 Bank of America 2009 Table of Contents Table 11 Long-term Debt By Major Currency December 31, 2009 (Dollars in millions) U.S. Dollar $ 281,692 Euros 99,917 Japanese Yen 19,903 British Pound 16,460 Australian Dollar 7,973 Canadian Dollar 4,894 Swiss Franc 2,666 Other 5,016 Total long-term debt $ 438,521 We use derivative transactions to manage the duration, interest rate and currency risks of our borrowings, considering the characteristics of the assets they are funding. For further details on our ALM activities, refer to Interest Rate Risk Management for Nontrading Activities beginning on page 83. We also diversify our funding sources by issuing various types of debt instruments including structured notes. Structured notes are debt obligations that pay investors with returns linked to other debt or equity securities, indices, currencies or commodities. We typically hedge the returns we are obligated to pay on these notes with derivative positions and/or in the underlying instruments so that from a funding perspective, the cost is similar to our other unsecured long-term debt. We could be required to immediately settle certain structured note obligations for cash or other securities under certain circumstances, which we consider for liquidity planning purposes. We believe, however, that a portion of such borrowings will remain outstanding beyond the earliest put or redemption date. At December 31, 2009, we had outstanding structured notes of $57 billion. Substantially all of our senior and subordinated debt obligations contain no provisions that could trigger a requirement for an early repayment, require additional collateral support, result in changes to terms, accelerate maturity, or create additional financial obligations upon an adverse change in our credit ratings, financial ratios, earnings, cash flows or stock price. The U.S. government and joint agencies have introduced various programs to stabilize and provide liquidity to the U.S. financial markets since 2007. We have participated in certain of these initiatives and we repaid our borrowings under U.S. government secured financing programs during 2009. We also participated in the FDIC TLGP which allowed us to issue senior unsecured debt that it guaranteed in return for a fee based on the amount and maturity of the debt. We issued $21.8 billion and $19.9 billion of FDIC-guaranteed long-term debt in 2009 and 2008. We have also issued short-term notes under the program. At December 31, 2009, we had $41.7 billion outstanding under the program. We no longer issue debt under this program and all of our debt issued under TLGP will mature by June 30, 2012. Under this program, our debt received the highest long-term ratings from the major credit ratings agencies which resulted in a lower total cost of issuance than if we had issued non-FDIC guaranteed long-term debt. The associated FDIC fee for the 2009 issuances was $554 million and is being amortized into expense over the stated term of the debt. For additional information on debt funding see Note 13 Long-term Debt to the Consolidated Financial Statements. Contingency Planning The Corporation maintains contingency funding plans that outline our potential responses to liquidity stress events at various levels of severity. These policies and plans are based on stress scenarios and include potential funding strategies, communication and notification procedures that we would implement in the event we experienced stressed liquidity conditions. We periodically review and test the contingency funding plans to validate efficacy and assess readiness. Our U.S. bank subsidiaries can access contingency funding through the Federal Reserve Discount Window. Certain non-U.S. subsidiaries have access to central bank facilities in the jurisdictions in which they operate. While we do not rely on these sources in our liquidity modeling, we maintain the policies, procedures and governance processes that would enable us to access these sources if necessary. Credit Ratings Our borrowing costs and ability to raise funds are directly impacted by our credit ratings. In addition, credit ratings may be important to customers or counterparties when we compete in certain markets and when we seek to engage in certain transactions including over-the-counter derivatives. It is our objective to maintain high quality credit ratings. Credit ratings and outlooks are opinions subject to ongoing review by the ratings agencies and may change from time to time based on our financial performance, industry dynamics and other factors. During 2009, the ratings agencies took numerous actions to adjust our credit ratings and outlooks, many of which were negative. The ratings agencies have indicated that our credit ratings currently reflect their expectation that, if necessary, we would receive significant support from the U.S. government. In February 2010, Standard & Poor affirmed our current credit ratings but revised the outlook to negative from stable based on their belief that it is less certain whether the U.S. government would be willing to provide extraordinary support. Other factors that influence our credit ratings include the ratings agencies assessment of the general operating environment, our relative positions in the markets in which we compete, reputation, liquidity position, the level and volatility of earnings, corporate governance and risk management policies, capital position and capital management practices. The credit ratings of Merrill Lynch & Co., Inc. from the three major credit ratings agencies are the same as those of Bank of America Corporation. The major credit ratings agencies have indicated that the primary drivers of Merrill Lynch credit ratings are Bank of America credit ratings. A reduction in our credit ratings or the ratings of certain asset-backed securitizations could potentially have an adverse effect on our access to credit markets, the related cost of funds and our businesses. If Bank of America Corporation or Bank of America, N.A. commercial paper or short-term credit ratings were downgraded by one level, our incremental cost of funds and potential lost funding could be material. The credit ratings of Bank of America Corporation and Bank of America, N.A. as of February 26, 2010 are reflected in the table below.

With the acquisition of Merrill Lynch on January 1, 2009, we acquired Merrill Lynch Bank USA and Merrill Lynch Bank & Trust Co., FSB. Effective July 1, 2009, Merrill Lynch Bank USA merged into Bank of America, N.A, with Bank of America, N.A. as the surviving entity. Effective November 2, 2009, Merrill Lynch Bank & Trust Co., FSB merged into Bank of America, N.A., with Bank of America, N.A. as the surviving entity. Further, with the acquisition of Countrywide on July 1, 2008, we acquired Countrywide Bank, FSB, and effective April 27, 2009, Countrywide Bank, FSB converted to a national bank with the name Countrywide Bank, N.A. and immediately thereafter merged with and into Bank of America, N.A., with Bank of America, N.A. as the surviving entity. Certain corporate sponsored trust companies which issue trust preferred securities (Trust Securities) are not consolidated under applicable accounting guidance. In accordance with Federal Reserve guidance, Trust Securities qualify as Tier 1 capital with revised quantitative limits that will be effective on March 31, 2011. Such limits restrict certain types of capital to 15 percent of total core capital elements for internationally active bank holding companies. In addition, the Federal Reserve revised the qualitative standards for capital instruments included in regulatory capital. Internationally active bank holding companies are those with consolidated assets greater than $250 billion or on-balance sheet exposure greater than $10 billion. At December 31, 2009, our restricted core capital elements comprised 11.8 percent of total core capital elements. Table 13 provides a reconciliation of the Corporation total shareholders equity at December 31, 2009 and 2008 to Tier 1 common capital, Tier 1 capital and total capital as defined by the regulations issued by the joint agencies. See Note 16 Regulatory Requirements and Restrictions to the Consolidated Financial Statements for more information on our regulatory capital.

(3) Balance includes a reduction of $18.7 billion and $6.7 billion related to allowance for loan and lease losses exceeding 1.25 percent of risk-weighted assets in 2009 and 2008. Balance also includes 45 percent of the pre-tax unrealized fair value adjustments on AFS marketable equity securities. At December 31, 2009, the Corporation Tier 1 common capital, Tier 1 capital, total capital and Tier 1 leverage ratios were 7.81 percent, 10.40 percent, 14.66 percent and 6.91 percent, respectively. The Corporation calculates Tier 1 common capital as Tier 1 capital including CES less preferred stock, qualifying trust preferred securities, hybrid securities and qualifying noncontrolling interest. CES is included in Tier 1 common capital based upon applicable regulatory guidance and our expectation that the underlying Common Equivalent Stock would convert into common stock following shareholder approval of additional authorized shares. Shareholders approved the increase in the number of authorized shares of common stock at the special meeting of shareholders held on February 23, 2010 and the Common Equivalent Stock converted to common stock on February 24, 2010. Tier 1 common capital increased to $120.4 billion at December 31, 2009 compared to $63.3 billion at December 31, 2008. The Tier 1 common capital ratio increased 301 bps to 7.81 percent. This increase was driven primarily by the second quarter at-the-market common stock issuance and the preferred to common stock exchanges which together represented a benefit of 185 bps and the issuance of CES which together provided a benefit of 138 bps to the Tier 1 common capital ratio. In addition, Tier 1 common capital benefited from the common stock that was issued in connection with the Merrill Lynch acquisition partially offset by an increase in risk-weighted assets due to the acquisition. Enterprise-wide Stress Testing As a part of our core risk management practices, the Corporation conducts enterprise-wide stress tests on a periodic basis to better understand earnings, capital and liquidity sensitivities to certain economic scenarios, including economic conditions that are more severe than anticipated. These enterprise-wide stress tests provide an understanding of the potential impacts to our risk profile, capital and liquidity. Scenario(s) are selected by a group comprised of senior line of business, risk and finance executives. Impacts to each line of business from each scenario are then analyzed and determined, primarily leveraging the models and processes utilized in everyday management routines. Impacts are assessed along with potential mitigating actions that may be taken in each scenario. Analysis from such stress scenarios is compiled for and reviewed through our ROC, ALMRC, and the Enterprise Risk Committee of the Board and serves to inform and be incorporated, along with other core business processes, into decision making by management and the Board. The Corporation continues to invest in and improve stress testing capabilities as a core business process. 50 Bank of America 2009 Table of Contents Off-Balance Sheet Liquidity Arrangements with Special Purpose Entities In the ordinary course of business, we support our customers financing needs by facilitating their access to the commercial paper market. In addition, we utilize certain financing arrangements to meet our balance sheet management, funding and liquidity needs. These activities utilize special purpose entities (SPEs), typically in the form of corporations, limited liability companies, or trusts, which raise funds by issuing short-term commercial paper or other debt or equity instruments to third party investors. These SPEs typically hold various types of financial assets whose cash flows are the primary source of repayment for the liabilities of the SPEs. Investors have recourse to the assets in the SPE and often benefit from other credit enhancements, such as overcollateralization in the form of excess assets in the SPE, liquidity facilities and other arrangements. As a result, the SPEs can typically obtain a favorable credit rating from the ratings agencies, resulting in lower financing costs for us and our customers. We have liquidity agreements, SBLCs and other arrangements with SPEs, as described below, under which we are obligated to provide funding in the event of a market disruption or other specified event or otherwise provide credit support to the entities. We also fund selected assets via derivative contracts with third party SPEs under which we may be required to purchase the assets at par value or the third party SPE cost to acquire the assets. We manage our credit risk and any market risk on these liquidity arrangements by subjecting them to our normal underwriting and risk management processes. Our credit ratings and changes thereto may affect the borrowing cost and liquidity of these SPEs. In addition, significant changes in counterparty asset valuation and credit standing may also affect the ability of the SPEs to issue commercial paper. The contractual or notional amount of these commitments as presented in Table 14 represents our maximum possible funding obligation and is not, in management view, representative of expected losses or funding requirements. The table below presents our liquidity exposure to unconsolidated SPEs, which include VIEs and QSPEs. VIEs are SPEs that lack sufficient equity at risk or whose equity investors do not have a controlling financial interest. QSPEs are SPEs whose activities are strictly limited to holding and servicing financial assets. As a result of our adoption of new accounting guidance on consolidation on January 1, 2010 as discussed in the following section, we consolidated all multi-seller conduits, asset acquisition conduits and credit card securitization trusts. In addition, we consolidated certain home equity securitization trusts, municipal bond trusts and credit-linked note and other vehicles. Table 14 Off-Balance Sheet Special Purpose Entities Liquidity Exposure December 31, 2009 (Dollars in millions) VIEs QSPEs Total Commercial paper conduits: Multi-seller conduits $ 25,135 $ $ 25,135 Asset acquisition conduits 1,232 1,232 Home equity securitizations 14,125 14,125 Municipal bond trusts 3,292 6,492 9,784 Collateralized debt obligation vehicles 3,283 3,283 Credit-linked note and other vehicles 1,995 1,995 Customer-sponsored conduits 368 368 Credit card securitizations 2,288 2,288 Total liquidity exposure $ 35,305 $ 22,905 $ 58,210 December 31, 2008 VIEs QSPEs Total Commercial paper conduits: Multi-seller conduits $ 41,635 $ $ 41,635 Asset acquisition conduits 2,622 2,622 Other corporate conduits 1,578 1,578 Home equity securitizations 13,064 13,064 Municipal bond trusts 3,872 2,921 6,793 Collateralized debt obligation vehicles 542 542 Customer-sponsored conduits 980 980 Credit card securitizations 946 946 Total liquidity exposure $ 49,651 $ 18,509 $ 68,160 At December 31, 2009, our total liquidity exposure to SPEs was $58.2 billion, a decrease of $10.0 billion from December 31, 2008. The decrease was attributable to decreases in commercial paper conduits due to maturities and liquidations partially offset by the acquisition of Merrill Lynch. Legacy Merrill Lynch related exposures as of December 31, 2009 were $4.9 billion in municipal bond trusts, $3.3 billion in CDO vehicles and $2.0 billion in credit-linked note and other vehicles. For more information on commercial paper conduits, municipal bond trusts, CDO vehicles, credit-linked note and other vehicles, see Note 9 Variable Interest Entities to the Consolidated Financial Statements. For more information on home equity and credit card securitizations, see Note 8 Securitizations to the Consolidated Financial Statements. Customer-sponsored conduits are established by our customers to provide them with direct access to the commercial paper market. We are typically one of several liquidity providers for a customer conduit. We do not provide SBLCs or other forms of credit enhancement to these conduits. Assets of these conduits consist primarily of auto loans and student loans. The liquidity commitments benefit from structural protections which vary depending upon the program, but given these protections, we view the exposures as investment grade quality. These commitments are included in Note 14 Commitments and Contingencies to the Consolidated Financial Statements. As we typically provide less than 20 percent of the total liquidity commitments to these conduits and do not provide other forms of support, we have concluded that we do not hold a Bank of America 2009 51 Table of Contents significant variable interest in the conduits and they are not included in our discussion of VIEs in Note 9 Variable Interest Entities to the Consolidated Financial Statements. Impact of Adopting New Accounting Guidance on Consolidation On June 12, 2009, the FASB issued new guidance on sale accounting criteria for transfers of financial assets, including transfers to QSPEs and consolidation of VIEs. As described more fully in Note 8 Securitizations to the Consolidated Financial Statements, the Corporation routinely transfers mortgage loans, credit card receivables and other financial instruments to SPEs that meet the definition of a QSPE which are not currently subject to consolidation by the transferor. Among other things, this new guidance eliminates the concept of a QSPE and as a result, existing QSPEs generally will be subject to consolidation under the new guidance. This new guidance also significantly changes the criteria by which an enterprise determines whether it must consolidate a VIE, as described more fully in Note 9 Variable Interest Entities to the Consolidated Financial Statements. A VIE is an entity, typically an SPE, which has insufficient equity at risk or which is not controlled through voting rights held by equity investors. Currently, a VIE is consolidated by the enterprise that will absorb a majority of the expected losses or expected residual returns created by the assets of the VIE. This new guidance requires that a VIE be consolidated by the enterprise that has both the power to direct the activities that most significantly impact the VIE economic performance and the obligation to absorb losses or the right to receive benefits that could potentially be significant to the VIE. This new guidance also requires that an enterprise continually reassesses, based on current facts and circumstances, whether it should consolidate the VIEs with which it is involved. The table below shows the impact on a preliminary basis of this new accounting guidance in terms of incremental GAAP assets and risk-weighted assets for those VIEs and QSPEs that we consolidated on January 1, 2010. The assets and liabilities of the newly consolidated credit card securitization trusts, multi-seller commercial paper conduits, home equity lines of credit and certain other VIEs are recorded at their respective carrying values. The Corporation has elected to account for the assets and liabilities of the newly consolidated asset acquisition commercial paper conduits, municipal bond trusts and certain other VIEs under the fair value option. Table 15 Preliminary Incremental GAAP and Risk-Weighted Assets Impact (Dollars in billions) Preliminary Incremental GAAP Assets Estimated Incremental Risk-Weighted Assets Type of VIE/QSPE Credit card securitization trusts ( 1 ) $ 70 $ 8 Asset-backed commercial paper conduits ( 2 ) 15 11 Municipal bond trusts 5 1 Home equity lines of credit 5 5 Other 5 Total $ 100 $ 25 (1) The Corporation undertook certain actions during 2009 related to its off-balance sheet credit card securitization trusts. As a result of these actions, we included approximately $63.6 billion of incremental risk-weighted assets in its risk-based capital ratios as of December 31, 2009. (2) Regulatory capital requirements changed effective January 1, 2010 for all ABCP conduits. The increase in risk-weighted assets in this table reflects the impact of these changes on all ABCP conduits, including those that were consolidated prior to January 1, 2010. In addition to recording the incremental assets and liabilities on the Corporation Consolidated Balance Sheet, we recorded an after-tax charge of approximately $6 billion to retained earnings on January 1, 2010 as the cumulative effect of adoption of these new accounting standards. The charge relates primarily to the addition of $11 billion of allowance for loan losses for the newly consolidated assets, principally credit card related. On January 21, 2010, the joint agencies issued a final rule regarding risk-based capital and the impact of adoption of the new consolidation guidance issued by the FASB. The final rule allows for a phase-in period for a maximum of one year for the effect on risk-weighted assets and the regulatory limit on the inclusion of the allowance for loan and lease losses in Tier 2 capital related to the assets that are consolidated. Our current estimate of the incremental impact is a decrease in our Tier 1 and Tier 1 common capital ratios of 65 to 75 bps. However, the final capital impact will be affected by certain factors, including, the final determination of the cumulative effect of adoption of this new accounting guidance on retained earnings, and limitations of deferred tax assets for risk-based capital purposes. The Corporation has elected to forgo the phase-in period and consolidate the amounts for regulatory capital purposes as of January 1, 2010. For more information, refer to the Regulatory Initiatives section on page 43. Basel Regulatory Capital Requirements In June 2004, the Basel II Accord was published with the intent of more closely aligning regulatory capital requirements with underlying risks, similar to economic capital. While economic capital is measured to cover unexpected losses, the Corporation also manages regulatory capital to adhere to regulatory standards of capital adequacy. The Basel II Final Rule (Basel II Rules), which was published on December 7, 2007, establishes requirements for the U.S. implementation and provided detailed capital requirements for credit and operational risk under Pillar 1, supervisory requirements under Pillar 2 and disclosure requirements under Pillar 3. The Corporation will begin Basel II parallel implementation during the second quarter of 2010. Financial institutions are required to successfully complete a minimum parallel qualification period before receiving regulatory approval to report regulatory capital using the Basel II methodology. During the parallel period, the resulting capital calculations under both the current (Basel I) rules and the Basel II Rules will be reported to the financial institutions regulatory supervisors for at least four consecutive quarterly periods. Once the parallel period is successfully completed, the financial institution will utilize Basel II as their methodology for calculating regulatory capital. A three-year transitional floor period will follow after which use of Basel I will be discontinued. In July 2009, the Basel Committee on Banking Supervision released a consultative document entitled Revisions to the Basel II Market Risk 52 Bank of America 2009 Table of Contents Framework that would significantly increase the capital requirements for trading book activities if adopted as proposed. The proposal recommended implementation by December 31, 2010, but regulatory agencies are currently evaluating the proposed rulemaking and related impacts before establishing final rules. As a result, we cannot determine the implementation date or the final capital impact. In December 2009, the Basel Committee on Banking Supervision issued a consultative document entitled Strengthening the Resilience of the Banking Sector. If adopted as proposed, this could increase significantly the aggregate equity that bank holding companies are required to hold by disqualifying certain instruments that previously have qualified as Tier 1 capital. In addition, it would increase the level of risk-weighted assets. The proposal could also increase the capital charges imposed on certain assets potentially making certain businesses more expensive to conduct. Regulatory agencies have not opined on the proposal for implementation. We continue to assess the potential impact of the proposal. Common Share Issuances and Repurchases In January 2009, the Corporation issued 1.4 billion shares of common stock in connection with its acquisition of Merrill Lynch. For additional information regarding the Merrill Lynch acquisition, see Note 2 Merger and Restructuring Activity to the Consolidated Financial Statements. In addition, during the first quarter of 2009, we issued warrants to purchase approximately 199.1 million shares of common stock in connection with preferred stock issuances to the U.S. government. For more information, see the following preferred stock discussion. During the second quarter of 2009, we issued 1.25 billion shares of common stock at an average price of $10.77 per share through an at-the-market issuance program resulting in gross proceeds of approximately $13.5 billion. In addition, we issued approximately 7.4 million shares under employee stock plans. In connection with the TARP repayment approval, the Corporation agreed to increase equity by $3.0 billion through asset sales to be approved by the Federal Reserve and contracted for by June 30, 2010. To the extent those asset sales are not completed by the end of 2010, the Corporation must raise a commensurate amount of common equity. We also agreed to raise up to approximately $1.7 billion through the issuance in 2010 of restricted stock in lieu of a portion of incentive cash compensation to certain of the Corporation associates as part of their 2009 year-end incentive payments. For more information regarding our common share issuances, see Note 15 Shareholders Equity and Earnings Per Common Share to the Consolidated Financial Statements. Common Stock Dividends The following table provides a summary of our declared quarterly cash dividends on common stock during 2009 and through February 26, 2010. Table 16 Common Stock Dividend Summary Declaration Date Record Date Payment Date Dividend Per Share January 27, 2010 March 5, 2010 March 26, 2010 $ 0.01 October 28, 2009 December 4, 2009 December 24, 2009 0.01 July 21, 2009 September 4, 2009 September 25, 2009 0.01 April 29, 2009 June 5, 2009 June 26, 2009 0.01 January 16, 2009 March 6, 2009 March 27, 2009 0.01 Preferred Stock Issuances and Exchanges During the second quarter of 2009, we completed an offer to exchange up to approximately 200 million shares of common stock at an average price of $12.70 for outstanding depositary shares of portions of certain series of preferred stock. In addition, we also entered into agreements with certain holders of other non-government perpetual preferred shares to exchange their holdings of approximately $10.9 billion aggregate liquidation preference of perpetual preferred stock into approximately 800 million shares of common stock. In total, the exchange offer and these privately negotiated exchanges covered the exchange of approximately $14.8 billion aggregate liquidation preference of perpetual preferred stock into approximately 1.0 billion shares of common stock. During the second quarter of 2009, we recorded an increase to retained earnings and net income applicable to common shareholders of approximately $580 million related to these exchanges. This represents the net of a $2.6 billion benefit due to the excess of the carrying value of our non-convertible preferred stock over the fair value of the common stock exchanged. This was partially offset by a $2.0 billion inducement to convertible preferred shareholders. The inducement represented the excess of the fair value of the common stock exchanged, which was accounted for as an induced conversion of convertible preferred stock, over the fair value of the common stock that would have been issued under the original conversion terms. On December 2, 2009, we received approval from the U.S. Treasury and Federal Reserve to repay the U.S. government $45.0 billion preferred stock investment provided under TARP. In accordance with the approval, on December 9, 2009, we repurchased all outstanding shares of Cumulative Perpetual Preferred Stock Series N, Series Q and Series R issued to the U.S. Treasury as part of the TARP. While participating in the TARP we recorded $7.4 billion in dividends and accretion on the TARP Preferred Stock and repayment will save us approximately $3.6 billion in annual dividends and accretion. We did not repurchase the related common stock warrants issued to the U.S. Treasury in connection with its TARP investment. The U.S. Treasury recently announced its intention to auction these warrants during March 2010. For more detail on the TARP Preferred Stock, refer to Note 15 Shareholders Equity and Earnings Per Common Share to the Consolidated Financial Statements. The Corporation repurchased the TARP Preferred Stock through the use of $25.7 billion in excess liquidity and $19.3 billion in proceeds from the sale of 1.3 billion units of CES valued at $15.00 per unit. The CES consisted of depositary shares representing interests in shares of Common Equivalent Junior Preferred Stock Series S (Common Equivalent Stock) and warrants (Contingent Warrants) to purchase an aggregate 60 million shares of the Corporation common stock. Each depositary share represented a 1/1000 th interest in a share of Common Equivalent Stock and each Contingent Warrant granted the holder the right to purchase 0.0467 of a share of a common stock for $.01 per share. Each depositary share entitled the holder, through the depository, to a proportional fractional interest in all rights and preferences of the Common Equivalent Stock, including conversion, dividend, liquidation and voting rights. The Corporation held a special meeting of stockholders on February 23, 2010 at which we obtained stockholder approval of an amendment to our amended and restated certificate of incorporation to increase the number of authorized shares of our common stock, and following effectiveness of the amendment, on February 24, 2010, the Common Equivalent Stock converted in full into our common stock and Bank of America 2009 53 Table of Contents the Contingent Warrants automatically expired without becoming exercisable, and the CES ceased to exist. Credit Risk Management The economic recession accelerated in late 2008 and continued to deepen into the first half of 2009 but has shown some signs of stabilization and possible improvement over the second half of the year. Consumers continued to be under financial stress as unemployment and underemployment remained at elevated levels and individuals spent longer periods without work. These factors combined with further reductions in spending by consumers and businesses, continued home price declines and turmoil in sectors of the financial markets continued to negatively impact both the consumer and commercial loan portfolios. During 2009, these conditions drove increases in net charge-offs and nonperforming loans and foreclosed properties as well as higher commercial criticized utilized exposure and reserve increases across most portfolios. The depth, breadth and duration of the economic downturn, as well as the resulting impact on the credit quality of the loan portfolios remain unclear into 2010. We continue to refine our credit standards to meet the changing economic environment. In our consumer businesses, we have implemented a number of initiatives to mitigate losses. These include increased use of judgmental lending and adjustment of underwriting, and account and line management standards and strategies, including reducing unfunded lines where appropriate. Additionally, we have increased collections, loan modification and customer assistance infrastructures to enhance customer support. In 2009, we provided home ownership retention opportunities to approximately 460,000 customers. This included completion of 260,000 customer loan modifications with total unpaid balances of approximately $55 billion and approximately 200,000 customers who were in trial-period modifications under the government Making Home Affordable program. As of January 2010, approximately 220,000 customers were in trial period modifications and more than 12,700 were in permanent modifications. Of the 260,000 modifications done during 2009, in terms of both the volume of modifications and the unpaid principal balance associated with the underlying loans most are in the portfolio serviced for investors and is not on our balance sheet. During 2008, Bank of America and Countrywide completed 230,000 loan modifications. The most common types of modifications include rate reductions, capitalization of past due amounts or a combination of rate reduction and capitalization of past due amounts, which are 17 percent, 21 percent and 40 percent, respectively, of modifications completed in 2009. We also provide rate and payment extensions, principal forbearance or forgiveness, and other actions. These modification types are generally considered TDRs except for certain short-term modifications where we expect to collect the full contractual principal and interest. A number of initiatives have also been implemented in our small business commercial domestic portfolio including changes to underwriting thresholds augmented by a judgmental decision-making process by experienced underwriters including increasing minimum FICO scores and lowering initial line assignments. We have also increased the intensity of our existing customer line management strategies. To mitigate losses in the commercial businesses, we have increased the frequency and intensity of portfolio monitoring, hedging activity and our efforts in managing an exposure when we begin to see signs of deterioration. Our lines of business and risk management personnel use a variety of tools to continually monitor the ability of a borrower or counterparty to perform under its obligations. It is our practice to transfer the management of deteriorating commercial exposures to independent Special Asset officers as a credit approaches criticized levels. Our experi - - ence has shown that this discipline generates an objective assessment of the borrower financial health and the value of our exposure, and maximizes our recovery upon resolution. As part of our underwriting process we have increased scrutiny around stress analysis and required pricing and structure to reflect current market dynamics. Given the volatility of the financial markets, we increased the frequency of various tests designed to understand what the volatility could mean to our underlying credit risk. Given the potential for single name risk associated with any disruption in the financial markets, we use a real-time counterparty event management process to monitor key counterparties. Additionally, we account for certain large corporate loans and loan commitments (including issued but unfunded letters of credit which are considered utilized for credit risk management purposes) that exceed our single name credit risk concentration guidelines under the fair value option. These loans and loan commitments are then actively managed and hedged, principally by purchasing credit default protection. By including the credit risk of the borrower in the fair value adjustments, any credit spread deterioration or improvement is recorded in other income immediately as part of the fair value adjustment. As a result, the allowance for loan and lease losses and the reserve for unfunded lending commitments are not used to capture credit losses inherent in any nonperforming or impaired loans and unfunded commitments carried at fair value. See the Commercial Loans Carried at Fair Value section on page 69 for more information on the performance of these loans and loan commitments and see Note 20 Fair Value Measurements to the Consolidated Financial Statements for additional information on our fair value option elections. The acquisition of Merrill Lynch contributed to both our consumer and commercial loans and commitments. Acquired consumer loans consisted of residential mortgages, home equity loans and lines of credit and direct/indirect loans (principally securities-based lending margin loans). Commercial exposures were comprised of both investment and non-investment grade loans and included exposures to CMBS, monolines and leveraged finance. Consistent with other acquisitions, we incorporated the acquired assets into our overall credit risk management processes. Consumer Portfolio Credit Risk Management Credit risk management for the consumer portfolio begins with initial underwriting and continues throughout a borrower credit cycle. Statistical techniques in conjunction with experiential judgment are used in all aspects of portfolio management including underwriting, product pricing, risk appetite, setting credit limits, operating processes and metrics to quantify and balance risks and returns. Statistical models are built using detailed behavioral information from external sources such as credit bureaus and/or internal historical experience. These models are a component of our consumer credit risk management process and are used, in part, to help determine both new and existing credit decisions, portfolio management strategies including authorizations and line management, collection practices and strategies, determination of the allowance for loan and lease losses, and economic capital allocations for credit risk. For information on our accounting policies regarding delinquencies, nonperforming status and charge-offs for the consumer portfolio, see Note 1 Summary of Significant Accounting Principles to the Consolidated Financial Statements. Consumer Credit Portfolio Weakness in the economy and housing markets, elevated unemployment and underemployment and tighter credit conditions resulted in deterioration across most of our consumer portfolios during 2009. However, 54 Bank of America 2009 Table of Contents during the last half of the year, the unsecured consumer portfolios within Global Card Services experienced lower levels of delinquency and by the fourth quarter consumer credit began to stabilize and in some cases improve. As part of our ongoing risk mitigation and consumer client support initiatives, we have been working with borrowers to modify their loans to terms that better align with their current ability to pay. Under certain circumstances, we identify these as TDRs which are modifications where an economic concession is granted to a borrower experiencing financial difficulty. For more information on TDRs and portfolio impacts, see Nonperforming Consumer Loans and Foreclosed Properties Activity beginning on page 62 and Note 6 Outstanding Loans and Leases to the Consolidated Financial Statements. Table 17 presents our consumer loans and leases and our managed credit card portfolio, and related credit quality information. Nonperforming loans do not include consumer credit card, consumer loans secured by personal property or unsecured consumer loans that are past due as these loans are generally charged off no later than the end of the month in which the account becomes 180 days past due. Real estate-secured past due loans, repurchased pursuant to our servicing agreement with Government National Mortgage Association (GNMA) are not reported as nonperforming as repayments are insured by the Federal Housing Administration (FHA). Additionally, nonperforming loans and accruing balances past due 90 days or more do not include the Countrywide purchased impaired loans even though the customer may be contractually past due. Loans that were acquired from Countrywide that were considered impaired were written down to fair value upon acquisition. In addition to being included in the Outstandings column in the following table, these loans are also shown separately, net of purchase accounting adjustments, for increased transparency in the Countrywide Purchased Impaired Loan Portfolio column. For additional information, see Note 6 Outstanding Loans and Leases to the Consolidated Financial Statements. Under certain circumstances, loans that were originally classified as discontinued real estate loans upon acquisition have been subsequently modified and are now included in the residential mortgage portfolio shown below. The impact of the Countrywide portfolio on certain credit statistics is reported where appropriate. Refer to the Countrywide Purchased Impaired Loan Portfolio discussion beginning on page 59 for more information. Loans that were acquired from Merrill Lynch were recorded at fair value including those that were considered impaired upon acquisition. The Merrill Lynch consumer purchased impaired loan portfolio did not materially alter the reported credit quality statistics of the consumer portfolios and is, therefore, excluded from the Countrywide Purchased Impaired Loan Portfolio column and discussion that follows. In addition, the nonperforming loans and delinquency statistics presented below include the Merrill Lynch purchased impaired loan portfolio based on the customer performance under the contractual terms of the loan. At December 31, 2009, consumer loans included $47.2 billion from Merrill Lynch of which $2.0 billion of residential mortgage and $146 million of home equity loans were included in the Merrill Lynch purchased impaired loan portfolio. There were no reported net charge-offs on these loans during 2009 as the initial fair value at acquisition date already considered the estimated credit losses.

Residential mortgages accruing past due 90 days or more represent repurchases of insured or guaranteed loans. See Residential Mortgage discussion for more detail. (3) Outstandings include foreign residential mortgages of $552 million at December 31, 2009 mainly from the Merrill Lynch acquisition. We did not have any foreign residential mortgage loans at December 31, 2008.

(6 ) Outstandings include consumer finance loans of $2.3 billion and $2.6 billion, and other foreign consumer loans of $709 million and $618 million at December 31, 2009 and 2008. n/a = not applicable Bank of America 2009 55 Table of Contents Table 18 presents net charge-offs and related ratios for our consumer loans and leases and net losses and related ratios for our managed credit card portfolio for 2009 and 2008. The reported net charge-off ratios for residential mortgage, home equity and discontinued real estate benefit from the addition of the Countrywide purchased impaired loan portfolio as the initial fair value adjustments recorded on those loans upon acquisition already included the estimated credit losses.

(2) Net charge-off ratios excluding the Countrywide purchased impaired loan portfolio were 1.82 percent and 0.36 percent for residential mortgage, 5.00 percent and 2.73 percent for home equity, 5.57 percent and 1.33 percent for discontinued real estate, and 4.52 percent and 2.29 percent for the total held portfolio for 2009 and 2008. These are the only product classifications materially impacted by the Countrywide purchased impaired loan portfolio for 2009 and 2008. For all loan and lease categories, the dollar amounts of the net charge-offs were unchanged. We believe that the presentation of information adjusted to exclude the impacts of the Countrywide purchased impaired loan portfolio is more representative of the ongoing operations and credit quality of the business. As a result, in the following discussions of the residential mortgage, home equity and discontinued real estate portfolios, we supplement certain reported statistics with information that is adjusted to exclude the impacts of the Countrywide purchased impaired loan portfolio. In addition, beginning on page 59, we separately disclose information on the Countrywide purchased impaired loan portfolio. Residential Mortgage The residential mortgage portfolio, which excludes the discontinued real estate portfolio acquired with Countrywide, makes up the largest percentage of our consumer loan portfolio at 42 percent of consumer loans and leases (43 percent excluding the Countrywide purchased impaired loan portfolio) at December 31, 2009. Approximately 15 percent of the residential portfolio is in GWIM and represents residential mortgages that are originated for the home purchase and refinancing needs of our affluent customers. The remaining portion of the portfolio is mostly in All Other and is comprised of both purchased loans as well as residential loans originated for our customers which are used in our overall ALM activities. Outstanding loans and leases decreased $5.9 billion at December 31, 2009 compared to December 31, 2008 due to lower balance sheet retention of new originations, paydowns and charge-offs as well as sales and conversions of loans into retained MBS. These decreases were offset, in part, by the acquisition of Merrill Lynch and GNMA repurchases. Merrill Lynch added $21.7 billion of residential mortgage outstandings as of December 31, 2009. At December 31, 2009 and 2008, loans past due 90 days or more and still accruing interest of $11.7 billion and $372 million were related to repurchases pursuant to our servicing agreements with GNMA where repayments are insured by the FHA. The increase was driven by the repurchase of delinquent loans from securitizations during the year as we repurchase these loans for economic reasons, with no significant detrimental impact to our risk exposure. Excluding these repurchases, the accruing loans past due 90 days or more as a percentage of consumer loans and leases would have been 0.72 percent (0.77 percent excluding the Countrywide purchased impaired loan portfolio) and 0.67 percent (0.72 percent excluding the Countrywide purchased impaired loan portfolio) at December 31, 2009 and 2008. Nonperforming residential mortgage loans increased $9.5 billion compared to December 31, 2008 due to the impacts of the weak housing markets and economic conditions and in part due to TDRs. For more information on TDRs, refer to the Nonperforming Consumer Loans and Foreclosed Properties Activity discussion on page 62 and Note 6 Outstanding Loans and Leases to the Consolidated Financial Statements. At December 31, 2009, $9.6 billion or approximately 58 percent, of the nonperforming residential mortgage loans were greater than 180 days past due and had been written down to their fair values. Net charge-offs increased $3.4 billion to $4.4 billion in 2009, or 1.74 percent (1.82 percent excluding the Countrywide purchased impaired portfolio), of total average residential mortgage loans compared to 0.36 percent (0.36 percent excluding the Countrywide purchased impaired portfolio) for 2008. These increases reflect the impacts of the weak housing markets and the weak economy. See the Countrywide Purchased Impaired Loan Portfolio discussion beginning on page 59 for more information. We mitigate a portion of our credit risk through synthetic securitizations which are cash collateralized and provide mezzanine risk protection of $2.5 billion which will reimburse us in the event that losses exceed 10 bps of the original pool balance. For further information regarding these synthetic securitizations, see Note 6 Outstanding Loans and Leases to the Consolidated Financial Statements. The reported net charge-offs for residential mortgages do not include the benefits of amounts reimbursable under cash collateralized synthetic securitizations. Adjusting for the benefit of this credit protection, the residential mortgage net charge-off ratio in 2009 would have been reduced by 25 bps and four bps in 2008. Synthetic securitizations and the protection provided by GSEs together provided risk mitigation for approximately 32 percent and 48 percent of our residential mortgage portfolio at December 31, 2009 and 2008. Our regulatory risk-weighted assets are reduced as a result of these risk protection transactions because we transferred a portion of our credit risk to unaffiliated parties. At December 31, 2009 and 2008, these 56 Bank of America 2009 Table of Contents transactions had the cumulative effect of reducing our risk-weighted assets by $16.8 billion and $34.0 billion, and strengthened our Tier 1 capital ratio by 11 bps and 24 bps and our Tier 1 common capital ratio by eight bps and 12 bps. Below is a discussion of certain risk characteristics of the residential mortgage portfolio, excluding the Countrywide purchased impaired loan portfolio, which contributed to higher losses. These characteristics include loans with high refreshed LTVs, loans which were originated at the peak of home prices in 2006 and 2007, loans to borrowers located in the states of California and Florida where we have concentrations and where significant declines in home prices have been experienced, as well as interest-only loans. Although the disclosures below address each of these risk characteristics separately, there is significant overlap in loans with these characteristics, which contributed to a disproportionate share of the losses in the portfolio. Excluding the Countrywide purchased impaired portfolio, residential mortgage loans with all of these higher risk characteristics comprised seven percent of the total residential mortgage portfolio at December 31, 2009, but have accounted for 31 percent of the residential mortgage net charge-offs in 2009. Residential mortgage loans with a greater than 90 percent but less than 100 percent refreshed LTV represented 11 percent of the residential mortgage portfolio and loans with a refreshed LTV greater than 100 percent represented 26 percent at December 31, 2009. Of the loans with a refreshed LTV greater than 100 percent, 90 percent were performing at December 31, 2009. Loans with a refreshed LTV greater than 100 per - - cent reflect loans where the outstanding book balance of the loan is greater than the most recent valuation of the property securing the loan. The majority of these loans have a refreshed LTV greater than 100 percent due primarily to home price deterioration from the weakened economy. Loans with refreshed FICO scores below 620 represented 16 percent of the residential mortgage portfolio. The 2006 and 2007 vintage loans, which represented 42 percent of our residential mortgage portfolio at December 31, 2009, continued to season and have higher refreshed LTVs and accounted for 69 percent of nonperforming residential mortgage loans at December 31, 2009 and approximately 75 percent of residential mortgage net charge-offs during 2009. The table below presents outstandings, nonperforming loans and net charge-offs by certain state concentrations for the residential mortgage portfolio. California and Florida combined represented 43 percent of the total residential mortgage portfolio and 47 percent of nonperforming residential mortgage loans at December 31, 2009, but accounted for 58 percent of the residential mortgage net charge-offs for 2009. The Los Angeles-Long Beach-Santa Ana Metropolitan Statistical Area (MSA) within California represented 12 percent and 13 percent of the total residential mortgage portfolio at December 31, 2009 and 2008. Additionally, 37 percent and 24 percent of loans in California and Florida are in reference pools of synthetic securitizations, as described above, which provide mezzanine risk protection. Table 19 Residential Mortgage State Concentrations December 31 Year Ended December 31 Outstandings Nonperforming Net Charge-offs (Dollars in millions) 2009 2008 2009 2008 2009 2008 California $ 82,329 $ 84,847 $ 5,967 $ 2,028 $ 1,726 $ 411 Florida 16,518 15,787 1,912 1,012 796 154 New York 16,278 15,539 632 255 66 5 Texas 10,737 10,804 534 315 59 20 Virginia 7,812 9,696 450 229 89 32 Other U.S./Foreign 97,378 101,377 7,101 3,218 1,614 303 Total residential mortgage loans (excluding the Countrywide purchased impaired residential mortgage loan portfolio) $ 231,052 $ 238,050 $ 16,596 $ 7,057 $ 4,350 $ 925 Total Countrywide purchased impaired residential mortgage loan portfolio (1) 11,077 10,013 Total residential mortgage loan portfolio $ 242,129 $ 248,063 (1) Represents acquired loans from Countrywide that were considered impaired and written down to fair value upon acquisition date. See page 59 for the discussion of the characteristics of the purchased impaired loans. Of the residential mortgage portfolio, $84.2 billion, or 35 percent, at December 31, 2009 are interest-only loans of which 89 percent were performing. Nonperforming balances on interest-only residential mortgage loans were $9.1 billion, or 55 percent, of total nonperforming residential mortgages. Additionally, net charge-offs on the interest-only portion of the portfolio represented 58 percent of the total residential mortgage net charge-offs for 2009. The Community Reinvestment Act (CRA) encourages banks to meet the credit needs of their communities for housing and other purposes, particularly in neighborhoods with low or moderate incomes. At December 31, 2009, our CRA portfolio comprised six percent of the total residential mortgage loan balances but comprised 17 percent of nonperforming residential mortgage loans. This portfolio also comprised 20 percent of residential mortgage net charge-offs during 2009. While approximately 32 percent of our residential mortgage portfolio carries risk mitigation protection, only a small portion of our CRA portfolio is covered by this protection. We have sold and continue to sell mortgage and other loans, including mortgage loans, to third-party buyers and to FNMA and FHLMC under agreements that contain representations and warranties related to, among other things, the process for selecting the loans for inclusion in a sale and compliance with applicable criteria established by the buyer. Such agreements contain provisions under which we may be required to either repurchase the loans or indemnify or provide other recourse to the buyer or insurer if there is a breach of the representations and warranties that materially and adversely affects the interests of the buyer or pursuant to such other standard established by the terms of such agreements. We have experienced and continue to experience increasing repurchase and similar demands from, and disputes with buyers and insurers. We expect to contest such demands that we do not believe are valid. In the event that we are required to repurchase loans that have been the subject of repurchase demands or otherwise provide indemnification or other recourse, this could significantly increase our losses and thereby affect our future earnings. For further information regarding representations and warranties, see Note 8 Securitizations to the Consolidated Financial Statements, and Item 1A., Risk Factors. Bank of America 2009 57 Table of Contents Home Equity The home equity portfolio is comprised of home equity lines of credit, home equity loans and reverse mortgages. At December 31, 2009, approximately 87 percent of the home equity portfolio was included in Home Loans & Insurance , while the remainder of the portfolio was primarily in GWIM. Outstanding balances in the home equity portfolio decreased $3.4 billion at December 31, 2009 compared to December 31, 2008 due to charge-offs and management of credit lines in the legacy portfolio partially offset by the acquisition of Merrill Lynch. Of the loans in the home equity portfolio at December 31, 2009 and 2008, approximately $26.0 billion, or 18 percent, and $23.2 billion, or 15 percent, were in first lien positions (19 percent and 17 percent excluding the Countrywide purchased impaired home equity loan portfolio). For more information on the Countrywide purchased impaired home equity loan portfolio, see the Countrywide Purchased Impaired Loan Portfolio discussion beginning on page 59. Home equity unused lines of credit totaled $92.7 billion at December 31, 2009 compared to $107.4 billion at December 31, 2008. This decrease was driven primarily by higher customer account net utilization and lower attrition as well as line management initiatives on deteriorating accounts with declining equity positions partially offset by the Merrill Lynch acquisition. The home equity line of credit utilization rate was 56 percent at December 31, 2009 compared to 52 percent at December 31, 2008. Nonperforming home equity loans increased $1.2 billion compared to December 31, 2008 due to the weak housing market and economic conditions and in part to TDRs. For more information on TDRs, refer to the Nonperforming Consumer Loans and Foreclosed Properties Activity discussion on page 62 and Note 6 Outstanding Loans and Leases to the Consolidated Financial Statements . At December 31, 2009, $721 million, or approximately 20 percent, of the nonperforming home equity loans were greater than 180 days past due and had been written down to their fair values. Net charge-offs increased $3.6 billion to $7.1 billion for 2009, or 4.56 percent (5.00 percent excluding the Countrywide purchased impaired loan portfolio) of total average home equity loans compared to 2.59 percent (2.73 percent excluding the Countrywide purchased impaired loan portfolio) in 2008. These increases were driven by continued weakness in the housing markets and the economy. There are certain risk characteristics of the home equity portfolio, excluding the Countrywide purchased impaired loan portfolio, which have contributed to higher losses. These characteristics include loans with high refreshed CLTVs, loans originated at the peak of home prices in 2006 and 2007 and loans in geographic areas that have experienced the most significant declines in home prices. Home price declines coupled with the fact that most home equity loans are secured by second lien positions have significantly reduced and, in some cases, eliminated all collateral value after consideration of the first lien position. Although the disclosures below address each of these risk characteristics separately, there is significant overlap in loans with these characteristics, which has contributed to a disproportionate share of losses in the portfolio. Excluding the Countrywide purchased impaired portfolio, home equity loans with all of these higher risk characteristics comprised 11 percent of the total home equity portfolio at December 31, 2009, but have accounted for 38 percent of the home equity net charge-offs for 2009. Home equity loans with greater than 90 percent but less than 100 percent refreshed CLTVs comprised 12 percent of the home equity portfolio while loans with refreshed CLTVs greater than 100 percent comprised 31 percent of the home equity portfolio at December 31, 2009. Net charge-offs on loans with a refreshed CLTV greater than 100 percent represented 82 percent of net charge-offs for 2009. Of those loans with a refreshed CLTV greater than 100 percent, 95 percent were performing at December 31, 2009. Home equity loans and lines of credit with a refreshed CLTV greater than 100 percent reflect loans where the balance and available line of credit of the combined loans are equal to or greater than the most recent valuation of the property securing the loan. The majority of these high refreshed CLTV ratios are due to the weakened economy and home price declines. In addition, loans with a refreshed FICO score below 620 represented 13 percent of the home equity loans at December 31, 2009. Of the total home equity portfolio, 68 percent at December 31, 2009 were interest-only loans. The 2006 and 2007 vintage loans, which represent 49 percent of our home equity portfolio, continued to season and have higher refreshed CLTVs and accounted for 62 percent of nonperforming home equity loans at December 31, 2009 and approximately 72 percent of net charge-offs for 2009. Additionally, legacy Bank of America discontinued the program of purchasing non-franchise originated home equity loans in the second quarter of 2007. These purchased loans represented only two percent of the home equity portfolio but accounted for 10 percent of home equity net charge-offs for 2009. The table below presents outstandings, nonperforming loans and net charge-offs by certain state concentrations for the home equity portfolio. California and Florida combined represented 41 percent of the total home equity portfolio and 50 percent of nonperforming home equity loans at December 31, 2009, but accounted for 60 percent of the home equity net charge-offs for 2009. In the New York area, the New York-Northern New Jersey-Long Island MSA made up 11 percent of outstanding home equity loans at December 31, 2009 but comprised only six percent of net charge-offs for 2009. The Los Angeles-Long Beach-Santa Ana MSA within California made up 11 percent of outstanding home equity loans at December 31, 2009 and 13 percent of net charge-offs for 2009.

See page 59 for the discussion of the characteristics of the purchased impaired loans. 58 Bank of America 2009 Table of Contents Discontinued Real Estate The discontinued real estate portfolio, totaling $14.9 billion at December 31, 2009, consisted of pay option and subprime loans obtained in the Countrywide acquisition. Upon acquisition, the majority of the discontinued real estate portfolio was considered impaired and written down to fair value. At December 31, 2009, the Countrywide purchased impaired loan portfolio comprised $13.3 billion, or 89 percent, of the $14.9 billion discontinued real estate portfolio. This portfolio is included in All Other and is managed as part of our overall ALM activities. See the Countrywide Purchased Impaired Loan Portfolio discussion below for more information on the discontinued real estate portfolio. At December 31, 2009, the purchased non-impaired discontinued real estate portfolio was $1.6 billion. Loans with greater than 90 percent refreshed LTVs and CLTVs comprised 25 percent of this portfolio and those with refreshed FICO scores below 620 represented 39 percent of the portfolio. California represented 37 percent of the portfolio and 30 percent of the nonperforming loans while Florida represented nine percent of the portfolio and 16 percent of the nonperforming loans at December 31, 2009. The Los Angeles-Long Beach-Santa Ana MSA within California made up 15 percent of outstanding discontinued real estate loans at December 31, 2009. Countrywide Purchased Impaired Loan Portfolio Loans acquired with evidence of credit quality deterioration since origination and for which it is probable at purchase that we will be unable to collect all contractually required payments are accounted for under the accounting guidance for purchased impaired loans, which addresses accounting for differences between contractual and expected cash flows to be collected from the Corporation initial investment in loans if those differences are attributable, at least in part, to credit quality. Evidence of credit quality deterioration as of the acquisition date may include statistics such as past due status, refreshed FICO scores and refreshed LTVs. Purchased impaired loans are recorded at fair value and the applicable accounting guidance prohibits carrying over or creation of valuation allowances in the initial accounting. The Merrill Lynch purchased impaired consumer loan portfolio did not materially alter the reported credit quality statistics of the consumer portfolios. As such, the Merrill Lynch consumer purchased impaired loans are excluded from the following discussion and credit statistics. Certain acquired loans of Countrywide that were considered impaired were written down to fair value at the acquisition date. As of December 31, 2009, the carrying value was $37.5 billion and the unpaid principal balance of these loans was $47.7 billion. Based on the unpaid principal balance, $30.6 billion have experienced no charge-offs and of these loans 82 percent, or $25.1 billion are current based on their contractual terms. Of the $5.5 billion that are not current, approximately 51 percent, or $2.8 billion are in early stage delinquency. During 2009, had the acquired portfolios not been accounted for as impaired, we would have recorded additional net charge-offs of $7.4 billion. During 2009, the Countrywide purchased impaired loan portfolio experienced further credit deterioration due to weakness in the housing markets and the impacts of a weak economy. As such, in 2009, we recorded $3.3 billion of provision for credit losses which was comprised of $3.0 billion for home equity loans and $316 million for discontinued real estate loans compared to $750 million in 2008. In addition, we wrote down Countrywide purchased impaired loans by $179 million during 2009 as losses on certain pools of impaired loans exceeded the original purchase accounting adjustment. The remaining purchase accounting credit adjustment of $487 million and the allowance of $3.9 billion results in a total credit adjustment of $4.4 billion remaining on all pools of Countrywide purchased impaired loans at December 31, 2009. For further information on the purchased impaired loan portfolio, see Note 6 Outstanding Loans and Leases to the Consolidated Financial Statements. The following discussion provides additional information on the Countrywide purchased impaired residential mortgage, home equity and discontinued real estate loan portfolios. Since these loans were written down to fair value upon acquisition, we are reporting this information separately. In certain cases, we supplement the reported statistics on these portfolios with information that is presented as if the acquired loans had not been accounted for as impaired upon acquisition. Residential Mortgage The Countrywide purchased impaired residential mortgage portfolio outstandings were $11.1 billion at December 31, 2009 and comprised 30 percent of the total Countrywide purchased impaired loan portfolio. Those loans with a refreshed FICO score below 620 represented 33 percent of the Countrywide purchased impaired residential mortgage portfolio at December 31, 2009. Refreshed LTVs greater than 90 percent after consideration of purchase accounting adjustments and refreshed LTVs greater than 90 percent based on the unpaid principal balance represented 65 percent and 80 percent of the purchased impaired residential mortgage portfolio. The table below presents outstandings net of purchase accounting adjustments and net charge-offs had the portfolio not been accounted for as impaired upon acquisition by certain state concentrations.

Bank of America 2009 59 Table of Contents Home Equity The Countrywide purchased impaired home equity outstandings were $13.2 billion at December 31, 2009 and comprised 35 percent of the total Countrywide purchased impaired loan portfolio. Those loans with a refreshed FICO score below 620 represented 21 percent of the Countrywide purchased impaired home equity portfolio at December 31, 2009. Refreshed CLTVs greater than 90 percent represented 90 percent of the purchased impaired home equity portfolio after consideration of purchase accounting adjustments and 89 percent of the purchased impaired home equity portfolio based on the unpaid principal balance at December 31, 2009.

(2) Represents additional net charge-offs had the portfolio not been accounted for as impaired upon acquisition. Pay option ARMs have interest rates that adjust monthly and minimum required payments that adjust annually (subject to resetting of the loan if minimum payments are made and deferred interest limits are reached). Annual payment adjustments are subject to a 7.5 percent maximum change. To ensure that contractual loan payments are adequate to repay a loan, the fully amortizing loan payment amount is re-established after the initial five or 10-year period and again every five years thereafter. These payment adjustments are not subject to the 7.5 percent limit and may be substantial due to changes in interest rates and the addition of unpaid interest to the loan balance. Payment advantage ARMs have interest rates that are fixed for an initial period of five years. Payments are subject to reset if the minimum payments are made and deferred interest limits are reached. If interest deferrals cause the loan principal balance to reach a certain level within the first 10 years of the loans, the payment is reset to the interest-only payment; then at the 10-year point, the fully amortizing payment is required. The difference between the frequency of changes in the loans interest rates and payments along with a limitation on changes in the minimum monthly payments to 7.5 percent per year can result in payments that are not sufficient to pay all of the monthly interest charges (i.e., negative amortization). Unpaid interest charges are added to the loan balance until the loan balance increases to a specified limit, which is no more than 115 percent of the original loan amount, at which time a new monthly payment amount adequate to repay the loan over its remaining contractual life is established. 60 Bank of America 2009 Table of Contents At December 31, 2009, the unpaid principal balance of pay option loans was $17.0 billion, with a carrying amount of $13.4 billion, including $12.5 billion of loans that were impaired upon acquisition. The total unpaid principal balance of pay option loans with accumulated negative amortization was $15.2 billion and accumulated negative amortization from the original loan balance was $1.0 billion. The percentage of borrowers electing to make only the minimum payment on option ARMs was 65 percent at December 31, 2009. We continue to evaluate our exposure to payment resets on the acquired negatively amortizing loans and have taken into consideration several assumptions regarding this evaluation (e.g., prepayment rates). We also continue to evaluate the potential for resets on the Countrywide purchased impaired pay option portfolio. Based on our expectations, 21 percent, eight percent and two percent of the pay option loan portfolio is expected to reset in 2010, 2011, and 2012, respectively. Approximately three percent are expected to reset thereafter, and approximately 66 percent are expected to repay prior to being reset. We manage these purchased impaired portfolios, including consideration for the home retention programs to modify troubled mortgages, consistent with our other consumer real estate practices. Credit Card Domestic The consumer domestic credit card portfolio is managed in Global Card Services . Outstandings in the held domestic credit card loan portfolio decreased $14.7 billion at December 31, 2009 compared to December 31, 2008 due to lower originations and transactional volume, the conversion of certain credit card loans into held-to-maturity debt securities and charge-offs partially offset by lower payment rates and new draws on previously securitized accounts. For more information on this conversion, see Note 8 Securitiza tions to the Consolidated Financial Statements. Net charge-offs increased $2.4 billion in 2009 to $6.5 billion reflecting the weak economy including elevated unemployment underemployment and higher bankruptcies. However, held domestic loans 30 days or more past due and still accruing interest decreased $668 million from December 31, 2008 driven by improvement in the last three quarters of 2009. Due to the decline in outstandings, the percentage of balances 30 days or more past due and still accruing interest increased to 7.90 percent from 7.13 percent at December 31, 2008. Managed domestic credit card outstandings decreased $24.5 billion to $129.6 billion at December 31, 2009 compared to December 31, 2008 due to lower originations and transactional volume and credit losses partially offset by lower payment rates. The $6.9 billion increase in managed net losses to $17.0 billion was driven by the same factors as described in the held discussion above. Managed loans that were 30 days or more past due and still accruing interest decreased $856 million to $9.9 billion compared to $10.7 billion at December 31, 2008. Similar to the held discussion above, the percentage of balances 30 days or more past due and still accruing interest increased to 7.61 percent from 6.96 percent at December 31, 2008 due to the decline in outstandings. Managed consumer credit card unused lines of credit for domestic credit card totaled $438.5 billion at December 31, 2009 compared to $713.0 billion at December 31, 2008. The $274.5 billion decrease was driven primarily by account management initiatives on higher risk customers in higher risk states and inactive accounts. The table below presents asset quality indicators by certain state concentrations for the managed credit card domestic portfolio. Table 24 Credit Card Domestic State Concentrations Managed Basis December 31 Year Ended December 31 Outstandings Accruing Past Due 90 Days or More Net Losses (Dollars in millions) 2009 2008 2009 2008 2009 2008 California $ 20,048 $ 24,191 $ 1,097 $ 997 $ 3,558 $ 1,916 Florida 10,858 13,210 676 642 2,178 1,223 Texas 8,653 10,262 345 293 960 634 New York 7,839 9,368 295 263 855 531 New Jersey 5,168 6,113 189 172 559 316 Other U.S. 77,076 91,007 2,806 2,666 8,852 5,434 Total credit card domestic loan portfolio $ 129,642 $ 154,151 $ 5,408 $ 5,033 $ 16,962 $ 10,054 Credit Card Foreign The consumer foreign credit card portfolio is managed in Global Card Services . Outstandings in the held foreign credit card loan portfolio increased $4.5 billion to $21.7 billion at December 31, 2009 compared to December 31, 2008 primarily due to the strengthening of certain foreign currencies, particularly the British pound against the U.S. dollar. Net charge-offs for the held foreign portfolio increased $688 million to $1.2 billion in 2009, or 6.30 percent of total average held credit card foreign loans compared to 3.34 percent in 2008. The increase was driven primarily by weak economic conditions and higher unemployment also being experienced in Europe and Canada, including a higher level of bankruptcies/insolvencies. Managed foreign credit card outstandings increased $3.1 billion to $31.2 billion at December 31, 2009 compared to December 31, 2008 primarily due to the strengthening of certain foreign currencies, partic - - ularly the British pound against the U.S. dollar. Managed consumer foreign loans that were accruing past due 90 days or more increased to $799 million, or 2.56 percent, compared to $717 million, or 2.55 percent, at December 31, 2008. The dollar increase was primarily due to the strengthening of foreign currencies, especially the British pound against the U.S. dollar, further exacerbated by continuing weakness in the European and Canadian economies. Net losses for the managed foreign portfolio increased $895 million to $2.2 billion for 2009, or 7.43 percent of total average managed credit card foreign loans compared to 4.17 percent in 2008. The increase in managed net losses was driven by the same factors as described in the held discussion above. Managed consumer credit card unused lines of credit for foreign credit card totaled $69.0 billion at December 31, 2009 compared to $80.6 billion at December 31, 2008. The $11.6 billion decrease was driven primarily by account management initiatives mainly on inactive accounts. Bank of America 2009 61 Table of Contents Direct/Indirect Consumer At December 31, 2009, approximately 45 percent of the direct/indirect portfolio was included in Global Banking (dealer financial services automotive, marine and recreational vehicle loans), 22 percent was included in Global Card Services (consumer personal loans and other non-real estate secured), 24 percent in GWIM (principally other non-real estate secured and unsecured personal loans and securities-based lending margin loans) and the remainder in Deposits (student loans). Outstanding loans and leases increased $13.8 billion to $97.2 billion at December 31, 2009 compared to December 31, 2008 primarily due to the acquisition of Merrill Lynch which included both domestic and foreign securities-based lending margin loans, partially offset by lower outstandings in the Global Card Services consumer lending portfolio. Net charge-offs increased $2.3 billion to $5.5 billion for 2009, or 5.46 per - - cent of total average direct/indirect loans compared to 3.77 percent for 2008. The dollar increase was concentrated in the Global Card Services consumer lending portfolio, driven by the effects of a weak economy including higher bankruptcies. Net charge-off ratios in the consumer lending portfolio have also been impacted by a significant slowdown in new loan production due, in part, to a tightening of underwriting criteria. Net charge-off ratios in the consumer lending portfolio were 17.75 percent during 2009, compared to 7.98 percent during 2008. The weak economy resulted in higher charge-offs in the dealer financial services portfolio. Loans that were past due 30 days or more and still accruing interest declined compared to December 31, 2008 driven by the consumer lending portfolio. The table below presents asset quality indicators by certain state concentrations for the direct/indirect consumer loan portfolio. Table 25 Direct/Indirect State Concentrations December 31 Year Ended December 31 Outstandings Accruing Past Due 90 Days or More Net Charge-offs (Dollars in millions) 2009 2008 2009 2008 2009 2008 California $ 11,664 $ 10,555 $ 228 $ 247 $ 1,055 $ 601 Texas 8,743 7,738 105 88 382 222 Florida 7,559 7,376 130 145 597 334 New York 5,111 4,938 73 69 272 162 Georgia 3,165 3,212 52 48 205 115 Other U.S./Foreign 60,994 49,617 900 773 2,952 1,680 Total direct/indirect loans $ 97,236 $ 83,436 $ 1,488 $ 1,370 $ 5,463 $ 3,114 Other Consumer At December 31, 2009, approximately 73 percent of the other consumer portfolio was associated with portfolios from certain consumer finance businesses that we have previously exited and are included in All Other . The remainder consisted of the foreign consumer loan portfolio which is mostly included in Global Card Services and deposit overdrafts which are recorded in Deposits . Nonperforming Consumer Loans and Foreclosed Properties Activity Table 26 presents nonperforming consumer loans and foreclosed properties activity during 2009 and 2008. Nonperforming loans held for sale are excluded from nonperforming loans as they are recorded at either fair value or the lower of cost or fair value. Nonperforming loans do not include consumer credit card, consumer loans secured by personal property or unsecured consumer loans that are past due as these loans are generally charged off no later than the end of the month in which the account becomes 180 days past due. Real estate-secured past due loans repurchased pursuant to our servicing agreements with GNMA are not reported as nonperforming as repayments are insured by the FHA. Additionally, nonperforming loans do not include the Countrywide purchased impaired portfolio. For further information regarding nonperforming loans, see Note 1 Summary of Significant Accounting Principles to the Consolidated Financial Statements. Total net additions to nonperforming loans in 2009 were $11.0 billion compared to $6.4 billion in 2008. The net additions to nonperforming loans in 2009 were driven primarily by the residential mortgage and home equity portfolios reflecting weak housing markets and economy, seasoning of vintages originated in periods of higher growth and performing loans that were accelerated into nonperforming loan status upon modification into a TDR. Nonperforming consumer real estate related TDRs as a percentage of total nonperforming consumer loans and foreclosed properties were 21 percent at December 31, 2009 compared to five percent at December 31, 2008 due primarily to increased modification volume during the year. The outstanding balance of a real estate secured loan that is in excess of the estimated property value, less costs to sell, is charged off no later than the end of the month in which the account becomes 180 days past due unless repayment of the loan is insured by the FHA. Property values are refreshed at least quarterly with additional charge-offs taken as needed. At December 31, 2009, $10.7 billion, or approximately 60 percent, of the nonperforming residential mortgage loans and foreclosed properties, comprised of $9.6 billion of nonperforming loans and $1.1 billion of foreclosed properties, were greater than 180 days past due and had been written down to their fair values and $790 million, or approximately 20 percent, of the nonperforming home equity loans and foreclosed properties, comprised of $721 million of nonperforming loans and $69 million of foreclosed properties, were greater than 180 days past due and had been written down to their fair values. In 2009, approximately 16 percent and six percent of the net increase in nonperforming loans were from Countrywide purchased non-impaired loans and Merrill Lynch loans that deteriorated subsequent to acquisition. While we witnessed increased levels of nonperforming loans transferred to foreclosed properties due to the lifting of various foreclosure moratoriums during 2009, the net reductions to foreclosed properties of $78 million were driven by sales of foreclosed properties and write-downs. Restructured Loans As discussed above, nonperforming loans also include certain loans that have been modified in TDRs where economic concessions have been granted to borrowers who have experienced or are expected to experience financial difficulties. These concessions typically result from the Corporation loss mitigation activities and could include reductions in the interest rate, payment extensions, forgiveness of principal, forbearance or other actions. Certain TDRs are classified as nonperforming at the time of 62 Bank of America 2009 Table of Contents restructure and may only be returned to performing status after considering the borrower sustained repayment performance for a reasonable period, generally six months. Nonperforming TDRs, excluding those loans modified in the purchased impaired portfolio, are included in Table 26. The pace of modifications slowed during the second half of 2009 due to the MHA and other programs where the loan goes through a trial period prior to formal modification. For more information on our modification programs, see Regulatory Initiatives beginning on page 43. At December 31, 2009, residential mortgage TDRs were $5.3 billion, an increase of $4.7 billion compared to December 31, 2008. Nonperforming TDRs increased $2.7 billion during 2009 to $2.9 billion. Nonperforming residential mortgage TDRs comprised approximately 17 percent and three percent of total residential mortgage nonperforming loans and foreclosed properties at December 31, 2009 and 2008. Residential mortgage TDRs that were performing in accordance with their modified terms and excluded from nonperforming loans in Table 26 were $2.3 billion, an increase of $2.0 billion compared to December 31, 2008. At December 31, 2009, home equity TDRs were $2.3 billion, an increase of $2.0 billion compared to December 31, 2008. Nonperforming TDRs increased $1.4 billion during 2009 to $1.7 billion. Nonperforming home equity TDRs comprised 44 percent and 11 percent of total home equity nonperforming loans and foreclosed properties at December 31, 2009 and 2008. Home equity TDRs that were performing in accordance with their modified terms and excluded from nonperforming loans in Table 26 were $639 million compared to $1 million at December 31, 2008. Discontinued real estate TDRs totaled $78 million at December 31, 2009. This was an increase of $7 million from December 31, 2008. Of these loans, $43 million were nonperforming while the remaining $35 million were classified as performing at December 31, 2009. We also work with customers that are experiencing financial difficulty by renegotiating consumer credit card and consumer lending loans, while ensuring that we remain within Federal Financial Institutions Examination Council (FFIEC) guidelines. These renegotiated loans are excluded from Table 26 as we do not classify consumer non-real estate unsecured loans as nonperforming. For further information regarding these restructured and renegotiated loans, see Note 6 Outstanding Loans and Leases to the Consolidated Financial Statements. Certain modifications of loans in the purchased impaired loan portfolio result in removal of the loan from the purchased impaired portfolio pool and subsequent classification as a TDR. These modified loans are excluded from Table 26. For more information on TDRs, renegotiated and modified loans, refer to Note 6 Outstanding Loans and Leases to the Consolidated Financial Statements.

(2) 2009 includes $465 million of nonperforming loans acquired from Merrill Lynch. (3) Consumer loans may be restored to performing status when all principal and interest is current and full repayment of the remaining contractual principal and interest is expected, or when the loan otherwise becomes well-secured and is in the process of collection. Certain TDRs are classified as nonperforming at the time of restructure and may only be returned to performing status after considering the borrower sustained repayment performance for a reasonable period, generally six months. (4) Our policy is not to classify consumer credit card and consumer loans not secured by real estate as nonperforming; therefore, the charge-offs on these loans have no impact on nonperforming activity. (5) Approximately half of the 2009 and 2008 nonperforming loans are greater than 180 days past due and have been charged off to approximately 68 percent and 71 percent of original cost. (6) Our policy is to record any losses in the value of foreclosed properties as a reduction in the allowance for credit losses during the first 90 days after transfer of a loan into foreclosed properties. Thereafter, all losses in value are recorded as noninterest expense. New foreclosed properties in the table above are net of $818 million and $436 million of charge-offs in 2009 and 2008 taken during the first 90 days after transfer. (7) 2009 includes $21 million of foreclosed properties acquired from Merrill Lynch. 2008 includes $952 million of foreclosed properties acquired from Countrywide. Bank of America 2009 63 Table of Contents Commercial Portfolio Credit Risk Management Credit risk management for the commercial portfolio begins with an assessment of the credit risk profile of the borrower or counterparty based on an analysis of its financial position. As part of the overall credit risk assessment, our commercial credit exposures are assigned a risk rating and are subject to approval based on defined credit approval standards. Subsequent to loan origination, risk ratings are monitored on an ongoing basis, and if necessary, adjusted to reflect changes in the financial condition, cash flow, risk profile or outlook of a borrower or counterparty. In making credit decisions, we consider risk rating, collateral, country, industry and single name concentration limits while also balancing the total borrower or counterparty relationship. Our lines of business and risk management personnel use a variety of tools to continuously monitor the ability of a borrower or counterparty to perform under its obligations. We use risk rating aggregations to measure and evaluate concentrations within portfolios. In addition, risk ratings are a factor in determining the level of assigned economic capital and the allowance for credit losses. For information on our accounting policies regarding delinquencies, nonperforming status and charge-offs for the commercial portfolio, see Note 1 Summary of Significant Accounting Principles to the Consolidated Financial Statements. Management of Commercial Credit Risk Concentrations Commercial credit risk is evaluated and managed with a goal that concentrations of credit exposure do not result in undesirable levels of risk. We review, measure and manage concentrations of credit exposure by industry, product, geography and customer relationship. Distribution of loans and leases by loan size is an additional measure of portfolio risk diversification. We also review, measure and manage commercial real estate loans by geographic location and property type. In addition, within our international portfolio, we evaluate borrowings by region and by country. Tables 31, 34, 38, 39 and 40 summarize our concentrations. Additionally, we utilize syndication of exposure to third parties, loan sales, hedging and other risk mitigation techniques to manage the size and risk profile of the loan portfolio. As part of our ongoing risk mitigation initiatives, we attempt to work with clients to modify their loans to terms that better align with their current ability to pay. In situations where an economic concession has been granted to a borrower experiencing financial difficulty, we identify these loans as TDRs. We account for certain large corporate loans and loan commitments (including issued but unfunded letters of credit which are considered utilized for credit risk management purposes) that exceed our single name credit risk concentration guidelines under the fair value option. Lending commitments, both funded and unfunded, are actively managed and monitored, and as appropriate, credit risk for these lending relationships may be mitigated through the use of credit derivatives, with the Corporation credit view and market perspectives determining the size and timing of the hedging activity. In addition, credit protection is purchased to cover the funded portion as well as the unfunded portion of certain other credit exposures. To lessen the cost of obtaining our desired credit protection levels, credit exposure may be added within an industry, borrower or counterparty group by selling protection. These credit derivatives do not meet the requirements for treatment as accounting hedges. They are carried at fair value with changes in fair value recorded in other income. Commercial Credit Portfolio During 2009, continued housing value declines and economic stress impacted our commercial portfolios which experienced higher levels of losses. Broad-based economic pressures, including further reductions in spending by consumers and businesses, have also impacted commercial credit quality indicators. Loan balances continued to decline in 2009 as businesses aggressively managed their working capital and production capacity by maintaining low inventories, deferring capital spending and rationalizing staff and physical locations. Additionally, borrowers increasingly accessed the capital markets for financing while reducing their use of bank credit facilities. Risk mitigation strategies further contributed to the decline in loan balances. Increases in nonperforming loans were largely driven by continued deterioration in the commercial real estate and commercial domestic portfolios. Nonperforming loans and utilized reservable criticized exposures increased from 2008 levels; however, during the second half of 2009 the pace of increase slowed for nonperforming loans while reservable criticized exposure declined in the fourth quarter. The loans and leases net charge-off ratios increased across all commercial portfolios. The increase in commercial real estate net charge-offs during 2009 compared to 2008 was driven by both the non-homebuilder and homebuilder portfolios, although homebuilder portfolio net charge-offs declined in the second half of 2009 compared to the first half of 2009. The increases in commercial domestic and commercial foreign net charge-offs were diverse in terms of borrowers and industries. The acquisition of Merrill Lynch increased our concentrations to certain industries and countries. For more detail on the Merrill Lynch impact, see the Industry Concentrations discussion beginning on page 70 and the Foreign Portfolio discussion beginning on page 74. There were also increased concentrations within both investment and non-investment grade exposures including monolines, and certain leveraged finance and CMBS positions. 64 Bank of America 2009 Table of Contents Table 27 presents our commercial loans and leases, and related credit quality information at December 31, 2009 and 2008. Loans that were acquired from Merrill Lynch that were considered impaired were written down to fair value upon acquisition. In addition to being included in the Outstandings column below, these loans are also shown separately, net of purchase accounting adjustments, for increased transparency, in the Merrill Lynch Purchased Impaired Loan Portfolio column. Nonperforming loans and accruing balances 90 days or more past due do not include Merrill Lynch purchased impaired loans even though the customer may be contractually past due. The portion of the Merrill Lynch port - - folio that was not impaired at acquisition was recorded at fair value in accordance with fair value accounting. This adjustment to fair value incorporates the interest rate, creditworthiness of the borrower and market liquidity compared to the contractual terms of the non-impaired loans at the date of acquisition. For more information, see Note 2 Merger and Restructuring Activity and Note 6 Outstanding Loans and Leases to the Consolidated Financial Statements. The acquisition of Countrywide and related purchased impaired loan portfolio did not impact the commercial portfolios.

See Note 20 Fair Value Measurements to the Consolidated Financial Statements for additional discussion of fair value for certain financial instruments. Table 28 presents net charge-offs and related ratios for our commercial loans and leases for 2009 and 2008. The reported net charge-off ratios for commercial domestic, commercial real estate and commercial foreign were impacted by the addition of the Merrill Lynch purchased impaired loan portfolio as the initial fair value adjustments recorded on those loans upon acquisition would have already included the estimated credit losses.

These are the only product classifications impacted by the Merrill Lynch purchased impaired loan portfolio in 2009. (3) Although the Merrill Lynch purchased impaired portfolio was recorded at fair value at acquisition on January 1, 2009, actual credit losses have exceeded the initial purchase accounting estimates. Included above are net charge-offs related to the Merrill Lynch purchased impaired portfolio in 2009 of $55 million for commercial domestic, $88 million for commercial real estate and $90 million for commercial foreign.

Bank of America 2009 65 Table of Contents Table 29 presents commercial credit exposure by type for utilized, unfunded and total binding committed credit exposure. Commercial utilized credit exposure includes funded loans, standby letters of credit, financial guarantees, bankers acceptances and commercial letters of credit for which the bank is legally bound to advance funds under prescribed conditions, during a specified period. Although funds have not been advanced, these exposure types are considered utilized for credit risk management purposes. Total commercial committed credit exposure decreased by $10.1 billion, or one percent, at December 31, 2009 compared to December 31, 2008. The decrease was largely driven by reductions in loans and leases partially offset by an increase in derivatives due to the acquisition of Merrill Lynch. Total commercial utilized credit exposure decreased to $494.4 billion at December 31, 2009 compared to $498.7 billion at December 31, 2008. Funded loans and leases declined due to limited demand for acquisition financing and capital expenditures in the large corporate and middle-market portfolios and as clients utilized the improved capital markets more extensively for their funding needs. With the economic outlook remaining uncertain, businesses are aggressively managing working capital and production capacity, maintaining low inventories and deferring capital spending. The increase in derivative assets was driven by the acquisition of Merrill Lynch substantially offset during 2009 by maturing transactions, mark-to-market adjustments from changing interest and foreign exchange rates, as well as narrower credit spreads. The loans and leases funded utilization rate was 57 percent at December 31, 2009 compared to 58 percent at December 31, 2008.

(2) Total commercial utilized exposure at December 31, 2009 and 2008 includes loans and issued letters of credit accounted for under the fair value option and is comprised of loans outstanding of $4.9 billion and $5.4 billion, and letters of credit with a notional amount of $1.7 billion and $1.4 billion. (3) Total commercial unfunded exposure at December 31, 2009 and 2008 includes loan commitments accounted for under the fair value option with a notional amount of $25.3 billion and $15.5 billion. (4) Excludes unused business card lines which are not legally binding. (5) Derivative assets are carried at fair value, reflect the effects of legally enforceable master netting agreements, and have been reduced by cash collateral of $58.4 billion and $34.8 billion at December 31, 2009 and 2008. Not reflected in utilized and committed exposure is additional derivative collateral held of $16.2 billion and $13.4 billion which consists primarily of other marketable securities at December 31, 2009 and 2008. (6) Total commercial committed assets held-for-sale exposure consists of $9.0 billion and $12.1 billion of commercial LHFS exposure (e.g., commercial mortgage and leveraged finance) and $5.3 billion and $2.3 billion of assets held-for-sale exposure at December 31, 2009 and 2008. Table 30 presents commercial utilized reservable criticized exposure by product type. Criticized exposure corresponds to the Special Mention, Substandard and Doubtful asset categories defined by regulatory authorities. In addition to reservable loans and leases, excluding those accounted for under the fair value option, exposure includes SBLCs, financial guarantees, bankers acceptances and commercial letters of credit for which we are legally bound to advance funds under prescribed conditions, during a specified period. Although funds have not been advanced, these exposure types are considered utilized for credit risk management purposes. Total commercial utilized reservable criticized exposure rose by $21.7 billion primarily due to increases in commercial real estate and commercial domestic. Commercial real estate increased $10.0 billion primarily due to the non-homebuilder portfolio which has been impacted by the weak economy partially offset by a decrease in the homebuilder portfolio. The $9.3 billion increase in commercial domestic reflects deterioration across various lines of business and industries, primarily in Global Banking. At December 31, 2009, approximately 85 percent of the loans within criticized reservable utilized exposure are secured.

(2) Excludes small business commercial domestic exposure. 66 Bank of America 2009 Table of Contents Commercial Domestic (excluding Small Business) At December 31, 2009, approximately 81 percent of the commercial domestic loan portfolio, excluding small business, was included in Global Banking (business banking, middle-market and large multinational corporate loans and leases) and Global Markets (acquisition, bridge financing and institutional investor services). The remaining 19 percent was mostly in GWIM (business-purpose loans for wealthy individuals). Outstanding commercial domestic loans, excluding loans accounted for under the fair value option, decreased driven primarily by reduced customer demand within Global Banking, partially offset by the acquisition of Merrill Lynch. Nonperforming commercial domestic loans increased $2.9 billion compared to December 31, 2008. Net charge-offs increased $1.7 billion in 2009 compared to 2008. The increases in nonperforming loans and net charge-offs were broad-based in terms of borrowers and industries. The acquisition of Merrill Lynch accounts for a portion of the increase in nonperforming loans and reservable criticized exposure. Commercial Real Estate The commercial real estate portfolio is predominantly managed in Global Banking and consists of loans made primarily to public and private developers, homebuilders and commercial real estate firms. Outstanding loans and leases, excluding loans accounted for under the fair value option, increased $4.7 billion at December 31, 2009 compared to December 31, 2008, primarily due to the acquisition of Merrill Lynch partially offset by portfolio attrition and losses. The portfolio remains diversified across property types and geographic regions. California and Florida represent the two largest state concentrations at 21 percent and seven percent for loans and leases at December 31, 2009. For more information on geographic or property concentrations, refer to Table 31. For the year, nonperforming commercial real estate loans increased $3.4 billion and utilized reservable criticized exposure increased $10.0 billion from December 31, 2008 across most property types and was attributable to the continuing impact of the housing slowdown, elevated unemployment and deteriorating vacancy and rental rates across most non-homebuilder property types and geographies during 2009. The increase in nonperforming loans was driven by the retail, office, multi-use, and land and land development portfolios. The increase in utilized reservable criticized exposure was driven by the office, retail and multi-family rental property types, offset by a $1.9 billion decrease in the homebuilder portfolio. For 2009, net charge-offs were up $1.8 billion compared to 2008 driven by increases in net charge-offs in both the non-homebuilder and the homebuilder portfolios. The following table presents outstanding commercial real estate loans by geographic region and property type. Commercial real estate primarily includes commercial loans and leases secured by non owner-occupied real estate which are dependent on the sale or lease of the real estate as the primary source of repayment.

(2) The geographically diversified category is comprised primarily of unsecured outstandings to real estate investment trusts and national home builders whose portfolios of properties span multiple geographic regions. (3) Primarily includes properties in the states of Colorado, Utah, Hawaii, Wyoming and Montana. (4) Includes commercial real estate loans accounted for under the fair value option of $90 million and $203 million at December 31, 2009 and 2008. (5) Homebuilder includes condominiums and residential land. (6) Represents loans to borrowers whose primary business is commercial real estate, but the exposure is not secured by the listed property types or is unsecured. During 2009, deterioration within the commercial real estate portfolio shifted from the homebuilder portfolio to the non-homebuilder portfolio. Non-homebuilder credit quality indicators and appraised values weakened in 2009 due to deteriorating property fundamentals and increased loss severities, whereas homebuilder credit quality indicators, while remaining elevated, began to stabilize. The non-homebuilder portfolio remains most at risk as occupancy and rental rates continued to deteriorate due to the current economic environment and restrained business hiring and capital investment. We have adopted a number of proactive risk mitigation initiatives to reduce utilized and potential exposure in the commercial real estate portfolios. Bank of America 2009 67 Table of Contents The following table presents commercial real estate credit quality data by non-homebuilder and homebuilder property types. Commercial real estate primarily includes commercial loans secured by non owner-occu - - pied real estate which is dependent on the sale or lease of the real estate as the primary source of repayment.

(2) Utilized reservable criticized exposure corresponds to the Special Mention, Substandard and Doubtful asset categories defined by regulatory authorities. This is defined as loans, excluding those accounted for under the fair value option, SBLCs and bankers acceptances. (3) Net charge-off ratios are calculated as net charge-offs divided by average outstanding loans excluding loans accounted for under the fair value option during the year for each loan and lease category. (4) Represents loans to borrowers whose primary business is commercial real estate, but the exposure is not secured by the listed property types or is unsecured. (5) Homebuilder includes condominiums and residential land. At December 31, 2009, we had total committed non-homebuilder exposure of $84.4 billion compared to $84.1 billion at December 31, 2008. The increase was due to the Merrill Lynch acquisition, largely offset by repayments and net charge-offs. Non-homebuilder nonperforming loans and foreclosed properties were $4.8 billion, or 7.73 percent of total non-homebuilder loans and foreclosed properties at December 31, 2009 compared to $1.2 billion, or 2.21 percent at December 31, 2008, with the increase driven by deterioration in the shopping center/retail, office, and land and land development portfolios. Non-homebuilder utilized reservable criticized exposure increased $11.9 billion to $18.1 billion, or 27.27 percent of total non-homebuilder utilized reservable exposure at December 31, 2009 compared to $6.3 billion, or 10.66 percent, at December 31, 2008. The increase was driven primarily by office, shopping center/retail and multi-family rental property types which have been the most adversely affected by high unemployment and the slowdown in consumer spending. For the non-homebuilder portfolio, net charge-offs increased $1.3 billion for 2009 compared to 2008 with the increase concentrated in non-homebuilder land and land development, office, shopping center/retail and multi-family rental property types. Within our total non-homebuilder exposure, at December 31, 2009, we had total committed non-homebuilder construction and land development exposure of $24.5 billion compared to $27.8 billion at December 31, 2008. Non-homebuilder construction and land development exposure is mostly secured and diversified across property types and geographies. Assets in the non-homebuilder construction and land development portfolio face significant challenges in the current rental market. Weak rental demand and cash flows and declining property valuations have resulted in increased levels of reservable criticized exposure and nonperforming loans and foreclosed properties. Nonperforming loans and foreclosed properties and utilized reservable criticized exposure for the non-homebuilder construction and land development portfolio increased $2.0 billion and $6.1 billion from December 31, 2008 to $2.6 billion and $8.9 billion at December 31, 2009. At December 31, 2009, we had committed homebuilder exposure of $10.4 billion compared to $16.2 billion at December 31, 2008 of which $7.3 billion and $11.0 billion were funded secured loans. The decline in homebuilder committed exposure was driven by repayments, charge-offs, reduced new home construction and continued risk mitigation initiatives. Homebuilder nonperforming loans and foreclosed properties stabilized due to the slowdown in the rate of home price declines. Homebuilder utilized reservable criticized exposure decreased by $1.9 billion driven by higher net charge-offs. The nonperforming loans, leases and foreclosed properties and the utilized reservable criticized ratios for the homebuilder portfolio were 42.16 percent and 74.44 percent at December 31, 2009 compared to 27.07 percent and 66.33 percent at December 31, 2008. Lower loan balances and exposures in 2009 drove a portion of the increase in the ratios. Net charge-offs for the homebuilder portfolio increased $524 million in 2009 from 2008. Commercial Foreign The commercial foreign loan portfolio is managed primarily in Global Banking . Outstanding loans, excluding loans accounted for under the fair value option, decreased due to repayments as borrowers accessed the capital markets to refinance bank debt and aggressively managed working capital and investment spending, partially offset by the acquisition of Merrill Lynch. Reduced merger and acquisition activity was also a factor contributing to modest new loan origination. Net charge-offs increased primarily due to deterioration in the portfolio, particularly in financial services, consumer dependent and housing-related sectors. For additional information on the commercial foreign portfolio, refer to the Foreign Portfolio discussion beginning on page 74. 68 Bank of America 2009 Table of Contents Small Business Commercial Domestic The small business commercial domestic loan portfolio is comprised of business card and small business loans primarily managed in Global Card Services . In 2009, small business commercial domestic net charge-offs increased $956 million from 2008. The portfolio deterioration was primarily driven by the impacts of a weakened economy. Approximately 77 percent of the small business commercial domestic net charge-offs for 2009 were credit card related products, compared to 75 percent in 2008. Commercial Loans Carried at Fair Value The portfolio of commercial loans accounted for under the fair value option is managed in Global Markets . The $477 million decrease in the fair value loan portfolio in 2009 was driven primarily by reduced corporate borrowings under bank credit facilities. We recorded net gains of $515 million resulting from changes in the fair value of the loan portfolio during 2009 compared to net losses of $780 million for 2008. These gains and losses were primarily attributable to changes in instrument-specific credit risk and were predominantly offset by net gains or net losses from hedging activities. In addition, unfunded lending commitments and letters of credit had an aggregate fair value of $950 million and $1.1 billion at December 31, 2009 and 2008 and were recorded in accrued expenses and other liabilities. The associated aggregate notional amount of unfunded lending commitments and letters of credit accounted for under the fair value option was $27.0 billion and $16.9 billion at December 31, 2009 and 2008 with the increase driven by the acquisition of Merrill Lynch. Net gains resulting from changes in fair value of commitments and letters of credit of $1.4 billion were recorded during 2009 compared to net losses of $473 million for 2008. These gains and losses were primarily attributable to changes in instrument-specific credit risk. Nonperforming Commercial Loans, Leases and Foreclosed Properties Activity The following table presents the additions and reductions to nonperforming loans, leases and foreclosed properties in the commercial portfolio during 2009 and 2008. The $16.2 billion in new nonaccrual loans and leases for 2009 was primarily attributable to increases within non-homebuilder commercial real estate property types such as shopping centers/retail, office, land and land development, and multi-use and within commercial domestic excluding small business, where the increases were broad-based across industries and lines of business. Approximately 90 percent of commercial nonperforming loans, leases and foreclosed properties are secured and approximately 35 percent are contractually current. In addition, commercial nonperforming loans are carried at approximately 75 percent of their unpaid principal balance before consideration of the allowance for loan and lease losses as the carrying value of these loans has been reduced to the estimated net realizable value.

(2) Includes small business commercial domestic activity. (3) Commercial loans and leases may be restored to performing status when all principal and interest is current and full repayment of the remaining contractual principal and interest is expected, or when the loan otherwise becomes well-secured and is in the process of collection. TDRs are generally classified as performing after a sustained period of demonstrated payment performance. (4) Business card loans are not classified as nonperforming; therefore, the charge-offs on these loans have no impact on nonperforming activity. (5) Outstanding commercial loans and leases exclude loans accounted for under the fair value option. Bank of America 2009 69 Table of Contents At December 31, 2009, the total commercial TDR balance was $577 million. Nonperforming TDRs increased $442 million while performing TDRs increased $78 million during 2009. Nonperforming TDRs of $486 million are included in Table 33. Industry Concentrations Table 34 presents commercial committed and commercial utilized credit exposure by industry and the total net credit default protection purchased to cover the funded and the unfunded portion of certain credit exposure. Our commercial credit exposure is diversified across a broad range of industries. Industry limits are used internally to manage industry concentrations and are based on committed exposure and capital usage that are allocated on an industry-by-industry basis. A risk management framework is in place to set and approve industry limits, as well as to provide ongoing monitoring. The Credit Risk Committee (CRC) oversees industry limits governance. Total commercial committed exposure decreased $10.1 billion in 2009 across most industries. Those industries that experienced increases in total commercial committed exposure in 2009 were driven by the Merrill Lynch acquisition. Diversified financials, our largest industry concentration, experienced an increase in committed exposure of $7.6 billion, or seven percent at December 31, 2009 compared to 2008. The total committed credit exposure increase was driven by the Merrill Lynch portfolio which contributed $34.7 billion, largely the result of $28.8 billion in capital markets industry exposure, primarily comprised of derivatives. This was offset, in part, by a reduction in legacy Bank of America positions of $27.1 billion, the majority of which came from a $21.2 billion reduction in capital markets industry exposure including the cancellation of $8.8 billion in facilities to legacy Merrill Lynch. Real estate, our second largest industry concentration, experienced a decrease in committed exposure of $12.4 billion, or 12 percent at December 31, 2009 compared to 2008. An $18.6 billion decrease in legacy Bank of America committed exposure, driven primarily by decreases in homebuilder, unsecured commercial real estate and commercial construction and land development exposure, was partially offset by the acquisition of Merrill Lynch. Real estate construction and land development exposure comprised 31 percent of the total real estate industry committed exposure at December 31, 2009. For more information on the commercial real estate and related portfolios, refer to the commercial real estate discussion beginning on page 67. The insurance and utilities committed exposure increased primarily due to the acquisition of Merrill Lynch. Refer to the Global Markets discussion beginning on page 35 and to the monoline and related exposure discussion below for more information. Retailing committed exposure declined 16 percent at December 31, 2009 compared to 2008, driven by the retirement of several large retail exposures and paydowns as retailers and wholesalers worked to reduce inventory levels. Monoline and Related Exposure Monoline exposure is reported in the insurance industry and managed under insurance portfolio industry limits. Direct loan exposure to monolines consisted of revolvers in the amount of $41 million and $126 million at December 31, 2009 and 2008. We have indirect exposure to monolines primarily in the form of guarantees supporting our loans, investment portfolios, securitizations, credit-enhanced securities as part of our public finance business and other selected products. Such indirect exposure exists when we purchase credit protection from monolines to hedge all or a portion of the credit risk on certain credit exposures including loans and CDOs. We underwrite our public finance exposure by evaluating the underlying securities. We also have indirect exposure to monoline financial guarantors, primarily in the form of guarantees supporting our mortgage and other loan sales. Indirect exposure may exist when we purchase credit protection from monoline financial guarantors to hedge all or a portion of the credit risk on certain mortgage and other loan exposures. A loss may occur when we are required to repurchase a loan and the market value of the loan has declined or when we are required to indemnify or provide recourse for a guarantor loss. We have experienced and continue to experience increasing repurchase demands from and disputes with monoline financial guarantors. We expect to contest such demands that we do not believe are valid. In the event that we are required to repurchase loans that have been the subject of repurchase demands or otherwise provide indemnification or other recourse, this could significantly increase our losses and thereby affect our future earnings. For further information regarding representations and warranties, see Note 8 Securitizations to the Consolidated Financial Statements and Item 1A., Risk Factors. Monoline derivative credit exposure at December 31, 2009 had a notional value of $42.6 billion compared to $9.6 billion at December 31, 2008. Mark-to-market monoline derivative credit exposure was $11.1 billion at December 31, 2009 compared to $2.2 billion at December 31, 2008, driven by the addition of Merrill Lynch exposures as well as credit deterioration related to underlying counterparties and spread widening in both wrapped CDO and structured finance related exposures. At December 31, 2009, the counterparty credit valuation adjustment related to monoline derivative exposure was $6.0 billion, which reduced our net mark-to-market exposure to $5.1 billion. We do not hold collateral against these derivative exposures. For more information on our monoline exposure, see the Global Markets discussion beginning on page 35. We also have indirect exposure as we invest in securities where the issuers have purchased wraps (i.e., insurance). For example, municipalities and corporations purchase protection in order to enhance their pricing power which has the effect of reducing their cost of borrowing. If the ratings agencies downgrade the monolines, the credit rating of the bond may fall and may have an adverse impact on the market value of the security. In the case of default, we first look to the underlying securities and then to recovery on the purchased insurance. Investments in securities issued by municipalities and corporations with purchased wraps at December 31, 2009 and 2008 had a notional value of $5.0 billion and $6.0 billion. Mark-to-market investment exposure was $4.9 billion at December 31, 2009 compared to $5.7 billion at December 31, 2008. 70 Bank of America 2009 Table of Contents Table 34 Commercial Credit Exposure by Industry (1, 2, 3) December 31 Commercial Utilized Total Commercial Committed (Dollars in millions) 2009 2008 2009 2008 Diversified financials $ 68,876 $ 50,327 $ 110,948 $ 103,306 Real estate (4) 75,049 79,766 91,479 103,889 Government and public education 44,151 39,386 61,446 58,608 Capital goods 23,834 27,588 47,413 52,522 Healthcare equipment and services 29,584 31,280 46,370 46,785 Consumer services 28,517 28,715 44,164 43,948 Retailing 23,671 30,736 42,260 50,102 Commercial services and supplies 23,892 24,095 34,646 34,867 Individuals and trusts 25,191 22,752 33,678 33,045 Materials 16,373 22,825 32,898 38,105 Insurance 20,613 11,223 28,033 17,855 Food, beverage and tobacco 14,812 17,257 27,985 28,521 Utilities 9,217 8,230 25,229 19,272 Energy 9,605 11,885 23,619 22,732 Banks 20,299 22,134 23,384 26,493 Media 11,236 8,939 22,832 19,301 Transportation 13,724 13,050 19,597 18,561 Religious and social organizations 8,920 9,539 11,371 12,576 Pharmaceuticals and biotechnology 2,875 3,721 10,343 10,111 Consumer durables and apparel 4,374 6,219 9,829 10,862 Technology hardware and equipment 3,135 3,971 9,671 10,371 Telecommunication services 3,558 3,681 9,478 8,036 Software and services 3,216 4,093 9,306 9,590 Food and staples retailing 3,680 4,282 6,562 7,012 Automobiles and components 2,379 3,093 5,339 6,081 Other 3,596 9,962 7,390 12,781 Total commercial credit exposure by industry $ 494,377 $ 498,749 $ 795,270 $ 805,332 Net credit default protection purchased on total commitments (5) $ (19,025 ) $ (9,654 ) (1) Total commercial utilized and total commercial committed exposure includes loans and letters of credit accounted for under the fair value option and are comprised of loans outstanding of $4.9 billion and $5.4 billion, and issued letters of credit with a notional amount of $1.7 billion and $1.4 billion at December 31, 2009 and 2008. In addition, total commercial committed exposure includes unfunded loan commitments with a notional amount of $25.3 billion and $15.5 billion at December 31, 2009 and 2008. (2) Includes small business commercial domestic exposure. (3) At December 31, 2009, total commercial utilized and total commercial committed exposure included $88.5 billion and $114.2 billion of exposure due to the acquisition of Merrill Lynch which included $31.7 billion and $34.7 billion in diversified financials and $12.3 billion and $13.0 billion in insurance with the remaining exposure spread across various industries. (4) Industries are viewed from a variety of perspectives to best isolate the perceived risks. For purposes of this table, the real estate industry is defined based upon the borrowers or counterparties primary business activity using operating cash flow and primary source of repayment as key factors. (5) Represents net notional credit protection purchased. Refer to the Risk Mitigation discussion beginning on page 71 for additional information. Risk Mitigation Credit protection is purchased to cover the funded portion as well as the unfunded portion of certain credit exposure. To lessen the cost of obtaining our desired credit protection levels, credit exposure may be added within an industry, borrower or counterparty group by selling protection. At December 31, 2009 and 2008, we had net notional credit default protection purchased in our credit derivatives portfolio to hedge our funded and unfunded exposures for which we elected the fair value option as well as certain other credit exposures of $19.0 billion and $9.7 billion. The increase from December 31, 2008 is primarily driven by the acquisition of Merrill Lynch. The mark-to-market impacts, including the cost of net credit default protection hedging our credit exposure, resulted in net losses of $2.9 billion in 2009 compared to net gains of $993 million in 2008. The average Value-at-Risk (VAR) for these credit derivative hedges was $76 million in 2009 compared to $24 million in 2008. The average VAR for the related credit exposure was $130 million in 2009 compared to $57 million in 2008. The year-over-year increase in VAR was driven by the combination of the Merrill Lynch and Bank of America businesses in 2009. There is a diversification effect between the net credit default protection hedging our credit exposure and the related credit exposure such that the combined average VAR was $89 million in 2009. Refer to the Trading Risk Management discussion beginning on page 80 for a description of our VAR calculation for the market-based trading portfolio. Bank of America 2009 71 Table of Contents Tables 35 and 36 present the maturity profiles and the credit exposure debt ratings of the net credit default protection portfolio at December 31, 2009 and 2008. The distribution of debt rating for net notional credit default protection purchased is shown as a negative and the net notional credit protection sold is shown as a positive amount.

(3) In addition to names which have not been rated, NR includes $2.3 billion and $948 million in net credit default swaps index positions at December 31, 2009 and 2008. While index positions are principally investment grade, credit default swaps indices include names in and across each of the ratings categories. In addition to our net notional credit default protection purchased to cover the funded and unfunded portion of certain credit exposures, credit derivatives are used for market-making activities for clients and establishing positions intended to profit from directional or relative value changes. We execute the majority of our credit derivative positions in the over-the-counter market with large, multinational financial institutions, including broker/dealers and, to a lesser degree, with a variety of other investors. Because these transactions are executed in the over-the-counter market, we are subject to settlement risk. We are also subject to credit risk in the event that these counterparties fail to perform under the terms of these contracts. In most cases, credit derivative transactions are executed on a daily margin basis. Therefore, events such as a credit downgrade (depending on the ultimate rating level) or a breach of credit covenants would typically require an increase in the amount of collateral required of the counterparty (where applicable), and/or allow us to take additional protective measures such as early termination of all trades. 72 Bank of America 2009 Table of Contents The notional amounts presented in Table 37 represent the total contract/notional amount of credit derivatives outstanding and include both purchased and written credit derivatives. The credit risk amounts are measured as the net replacement cost in the event the counterparties with contracts in a gain position to us fail to perform under the terms of those contracts. The addition of Merrill Lynch drove the increase in counterparty credit risk for purchased credit derivatives and the increase in the contract/notional amount. For information on the performance risk of our written credit derivatives, see Note 4 Derivatives to the Consolidated Financial Statements. The credit risk amounts discussed above and noted in the table below take into consideration the effects of legally enforceable master netting agreements while amounts disclosed in Note 4 Derivatives to the Consolidated Financial Statements are shown on a gross basis. Credit risk reflects the potential benefit from offsetting exposure to non-credit derivative products with the same counterparties that may be netted upon the occurrence of certain events, thereby reducing the Corporation overall exposure.

These adjustments are necessary as the market quotes on derivatives do not fully reflect the credit risk of the counterparties to the derivative assets. We consider collateral and legally enforceable master netting agreements that mitigate our credit exposure to each counterparty in determining the counterparty credit risk valuation adjustment. All or a portion of these counterparty credit risk valuation adjustments are reversed or otherwise adjusted in future periods due to changes in the value of the derivative contract, collateral and creditworthiness of the counterparty. During 2009, credit valuation gains (losses) were recognized in trading account profits (losses) related to counterparty credit risk on derivative assets. For additional information on gains or losses related to the counterparty credit risk on derivative assets, refer to Note 4 Derivatives to the Consolidated Financial Statements . For information on our monoline counterparty credit risk, see the discussion beginning on pages 37 and 70, and for information on our CDO-related counterparty credit risk, see the Global Markets discussion beginning on page 35. Bank of America 2009 73 Table of Contents Foreign Portfolio Our foreign credit and trading portfolio is subject to country risk. We define country risk as the risk of loss from unfavorable economic and political conditions, currency fluctuations, social instability and changes in government policies. A risk management framework is in place to measure, monitor and manage foreign risk and exposures. Management oversight of country risk including cross-border risk is provided by the Regional Risk Committee, a subcommittee of the CRC. The following table sets forth total foreign exposure broken out by region at December 31, 2009 and 2008. Foreign exposure includes credit exposure net of local liabilities, securities, and other investments issued by or domiciled in countries other than the U.S. Total foreign exposure can be adjusted for externally guaranteed outstandings and certain collateral types. Exposures which are assigned external guarantees are reported under the country of the guarantor. Exposures with tangible collateral are reflected in the country where the collateral is held. For securities received, other than cross-border resale agreements, outstandings are assigned to the domicile of the issuer of the securities. Resale agreements are generally presented based on the domicile of the counterparty consistent with FFIEC reporting requirements. Table 38 Regional Foreign Exposure (1, 2, 3) December 31 (Dollars in millions) 2009 2008 Europe $ 170,796 $ 66,472 Asia Pacific 47,645 39,774 Latin America 19,516 11,378 Middle East and Africa 3,906 2,456 Other 15,799 10,988 Total $ 257,662 $ 131,068 (1) Local funding or liabilities are subtracted from local exposures consistent with FFIEC reporting requirements. (2) Exposures have been reduced by $34.3 billion and $19.6 billion at December 31, 2009 and 2008 for the cash applied as collateral to derivative assets. (3) Generally, resale agreements are presented based on the domicile of the counterparty, consistent with FFIEC reporting requirements. Cross-border resale agreements where the underlying securities are U.S. Treasury securities, in which case the domicile is the U.S., are excluded from this presentation. Our total foreign exposure was $257.7 billion at December 31, 2009, an increase of $126.6 billion from December 31, 2008. Our foreign exposure remained concentrated in Europe, which accounted for $170.8 billion, or 66 percent, of total foreign exposure. The European exposure was mostly in Western Europe and was distributed across a variety of industries. Asia Pacific was our second largest foreign exposure at $47.6 billion, or 18 percent. Latin America accounted for $19.5 billion, or eight percent, of total foreign exposure. The increases of $104.3 billion, $7.9 billion and $8.1 billion in our foreign exposure in Europe, Asia Pacific and Latin America, respectively, from December 31, 2008 were primarily due to the acquisition of Merrill Lynch. For more information on our Asia Pacific and Latin America exposure, see the discussion of the foreign exposure to selected countries defined as emerging markets below. As shown in Table 39, at December 31, 2009 and 2008, the United Kingdom had total cross-border exposure of $60.7 billion and $13.3 billion, representing 2.73 percent and 0.73 percent of our total assets. The United Kingdom was the only country where the total cross-border exposure exceeded one percent of our total assets at December 31, 2009. The increase of $47.4 billion was primarily due to the acquisition of Merrill Lynch. At December 31, 2009, Germany and France, with total cross-border exposure of $18.9 billion and $17.4 billion, representing 0.85 percent and 0.78 percent of total assets were the only other countries that had total cross-border exposure which exceeded 0.75 percent of our total assets. Exposure includes cross-border claims by our foreign offices including loans, acceptances, time deposits placed, trading account assets, securities, derivative assets, other interest-earning investments and other monetary assets. Amounts also include unused commitments, SBLCs, commercial letters of credit and formal guarantees. Sector definitions are consistent with FFIEC reporting requirements for preparing the Country Exposure Report.

Derivative assets were collateralized by other marketable securities of $18 million and $124 million at December 31, 2009 and 2008. 74 Bank of America 2009 Table of Contents As presented in Table 40, foreign exposure to borrowers or counterparties in emerging markets increased $4.7 billion to $50.6 billion at December 31, 2009, compared to $45.8 billion at December 31, 2008. The increase was due to the acquisition of Merrill Lynch partially offset by the sale of CCB common shares in 2009. Foreign exposure to borrowers or counterparties in emerging markets represented 20 percent and 35 percent of total foreign exposure at December 31, 2009 and 2008.

(3) Derivative assets are carried at fair value and have been reduced by the amount of cash collateral applied of $557 million and $152 million at December 31, 2009 and 2008. At December 31, 2009 and 2008, there were $616 million and $531 million of other marketable securities collateralizing derivative assets. (4) Generally, cross-border resale agreements are presented based on the domicile of the counterparty, consistent with FFIEC reporting requirements. Cross-border resale agreements where the underlying securities are U.S. Treasury securities, in which case the domicile is the U.S., are excluded from this presentation. (5) Cross-border exposure includes amounts payable to the Corporation by borrowers or counterparties with a country of residence other than the one in which the credit is booked, regardless of the currency in which the claim is denominated, consistent with FFIEC reporting requirements. (6) Local country exposure includes amounts payable to the Corporation by borrowers with a country of residence in which the credit is booked, regardless of the currency in which the claim is denominated. Local funding or liabilities are subtracted from local exposures consistent with FFIEC reporting requirements. Total amount of available local liabilities funding local country exposure at December 31, 2009 was $17.6 billion compared to $12.6 billion at December 31, 2008. Local liabilities at December 31, 2009 in Asia Pacific, Latin America, and Middle East and Africa were $16.3 billion, $857 million and $449 million, respectively, of which $8.7 billion were in Singapore, $2.1 billion were in Hong Kong, $1.5 billion were in both China and India, $1.3 billion were in South Korea, and $734 million were in Mexico. There were no other countries with available local liabilities funding local country exposure greater than $500 million. (7) No country included in Other Asia Pacific, Other Latin America, Other Middle East and Africa, and Other Central and Eastern Europe had total foreign exposure of more than $500 million. Bank of America 2009 75 Table of Contents At December 31, 2009 and 2008, 53 percent and 73 percent of the emerging markets exposure was in Asia Pacific. Emerging markets exposure in Asia Pacific decreased by $6.5 billion driven by the sale of CCB common shares in 2009. Our exposure in China was primarily related to our equity investment in CCB which accounted for $9.2 billion and $19.7 billion at December 31, 2009 and 2008. For more information on our CCB investment, refer to the All Other discussion beginning on page 41. At December 31, 2009, 35 percent of the emerging markets exposure was in Latin America compared to 20 percent at December 31, 2008. Latin America emerging markets exposure increased by $8.3 billion due to the acquisition of Merrill Lynch. Our exposure in Brazil was primarily related to the carrying value of our investment in Ita Unibanco, which accounted for $5.4 billion and $2.5 billion of exposure in Brazil at December 31, 2009 and 2008. Our equity investment in Ita Unibanco represents five percent and eight percent of its outstanding voting and non-voting shares at December 31, 2009 and 2008. Our exposure in Mexico was primarily related to our 24.9 percent investment in Santander, which is classified as securities and other investments in Table 40, and accounted for $2.5 billion and $2.1 billion of exposure in Mexico at December 31, 2009 and 2008. At December 31, 2009 and 2008, seven percent and six percent of the emerging markets exposure was in Middle East and Africa, with the increase of $1.3 billion due to the acquisition of Merrill Lynch. At December 31, 2009 and 2008, five percent and one percent of the emerging markets exposure was in Central and Eastern Europe which increased by $1.6 billion due to the acquisition of Merrill Lynch. Provision for Credit Losses The provision for credit losses increased $21.7 billion to $48.6 billion for 2009 compared to 2008. The consumer portion of the provision for credit losses increased $15.1 billion to $36.9 billion for 2009 compared to 2008. The increase was driven by higher net charge-offs in our consumer real estate, consumer credit card and consumer lending portfolios, reflecting deterioration in the economy and housing markets. In addition to higher net charge-offs, the provision increase was also driven by higher reserve additions for deterioration in the purchased impaired and residential mortgage portfolios, new draws on previously securitized accounts as well as an approximate $800 million addition to increase the reserve coverage to approximately 12 months of charge-offs in consumer credit card. These increases were partially offset by lower reserve additions in our unsecured domestic consumer lending portfolios resulting from improved delinquencies and in the home equity portfolio due to the slowdown in the pace of deterioration. In the Countrywide and Merrill Lynch consumer purchased impaired portfolios, the additions to reserves to reflect further reductions in expected principal cash flows were $3.5 billion in 2009 compared to $750 million in 2008. The increase was primarily related to the home equity purchased impaired portfolio. The commercial portion of the provision for credit losses including the provision for unfunded lending commitments increased $6.7 billion to $11.7 billion for 2009 compared to 2008. The increase was driven by higher net charge-offs and higher additions to the reserves in the commercial real estate and commercial domestic portfolios, reflecting deterioration across a broad range of property types, industries and borrowers. These increases were partially offset by lower reserve additions in the small business portfolio due to improved delinquencies. Allowance for Credit Losses The allowance for loan and lease losses excludes loans accounted for under the fair value option as fair value adjustments related to loans measured at fair value include a credit risk component. The allowance for loan and lease losses is allocated based on two components. We evaluate the adequacy of the allowance for loan and lease losses based on the combined total of these two components. The first component of the allowance for loan and lease losses covers those commercial loans, excluding loans accounted for under the fair value option, that are either nonperforming or impaired, or consumer real estate loans that have been modified in a TDR. These loans are subject to impairment measurement at the loan level based on the present value of expected future cash flows discounted at the loan contractual effective interest rate (or collateral value or observable market price). When the values are lower than the carrying value of that loan, impairment is recognized. For purposes of computing this specific loss component of the allowance, larger impaired loans are evaluated individually and smaller impaired loans are evaluated as a pool using historical loss experience for the respective product types and risk ratings of the loans. The second component of the allowance for loan and lease losses covers performing consumer and commercial loans and leases excluding loans accounted for under the fair value option. The allowance for commercial loan and lease losses is established by product type after analyzing historical loss experience by internal risk rating, current economic conditions, industry performance trends, geographic or obligor concentrations within each portfolio segment, and any other pertinent information. The commercial historical loss experience is updated quarterly to incorporate the most recent data reflective of the current economic environment. As of December 31, 2009, quarterly updates to historical loss experience resulted in an increase in the allowance for loan and lease losses most significantly in the commercial real estate portfolio. The allowance for consumer and certain homogeneous commercial loan and lease products is based on aggregated portfolio segment evaluations, generally by product type. Loss forecast models are utilized that consider a variety of factors including, but not limited to, historical loss experience, estimated defaults or foreclosures based on portfolio trends, delinquencies, economic trends and credit scores. These loss forecast models are updated on a quarterly basis to incorporate information reflecting the current economic environment. As of December 31, 2009, quarterly updates to the loss forecast models resulted in increases in the allowance for loan and lease losses in the consumer real estate and foreign credit card portfolios and reductions in the allowance for the Global Card Services consumer lending and domestic credit card portfolios. We monitor differences between estimated and actual incurred loan and lease losses. This monitoring process includes periodic assessments by senior management of loan and lease portfolios and the models used to estimate incurred losses in those portfolios. Additions to the allowance for loan and lease losses are made by charges to the provision for credit losses. Credit exposures deemed to be uncollectible are charged against the allowance for loan and lease losses. Recoveries of previously charged off amounts are credited to the allowance for loan and lease losses. The allowance for loan and lease losses for the consumer portfolio as presented in Table 42 was $27.8 billion at December 31, 2009, an increase of $11.1 billion from December 31, 2008. This increase was primarily related to the impact of the weak economy and deterioration in 76 Bank of America 2009 Table of Contents the housing markets, which drove reserve builds for higher losses across most consumer portfolios. With respect to the Countrywide and Merrill Lynch consumer purchased impaired portfolios, updating of our expected principal cash flows resulted in an increase in reserves of $3.5 billion in the home equity, discontinued real estate, and residential mortgage portfolios. The allowance for commercial loan and lease losses was $9.4 billion at December 31, 2009, a $3.0 billion increase from December 31, 2008. The increase in allowance levels was driven by reserve increases on the commercial real estate and commercial domestic portfolios within Global Banking . The allowance for loan and lease losses as a percentage of total loans and leases outstanding was 4.16 percent at December 31, 2009, compared to 2.49 percent at December 31, 2008. The increase in the ratio was primarily driven by consumer reserve increases for higher losses in the residential mortgage, consumer card and home equity portfolios, reflecting deterioration in the housing markets and the impact of the weak economy. The increase was also the result of reserve increases in the commercial real estate and commercial domestic portfolios reflecting broad-based deterioration across various borrowers, industries, and property types. In addition, the December 31, 2009 and 2008 ratios include the impact of the purchased impaired portfolio. Excluding the impacts of the purchased impaired portfolio, the allowance for loan and lease losses as a percentage of total loans and leases outstanding was 3.88 percent at December 31, 2009, compared to 2.53 percent at December 31, 2008. Reserve for Unfunded Lending Commitments In addition to the allowance for loan and lease losses, we also estimate probable losses related to unfunded lending commitments excluding commitments accounted for under the fair value option, such as letters of credit and financial guarantees, and binding unfunded loan commitments. Unfunded lending commitments are subject to the same assessment as funded loans, except utilization assumptions are considered. The reserve for unfunded lending commitments is included in accrued expenses and other liabilities on the Consolidated Balance Sheet with changes to the reserve generally made through the provision for credit losses. The reserve for unfunded lending commitments at December 31, 2009 was $1.5 billion compared to $421 million at December 31, 2008. The increase was largely driven by the fair value of the acquired Merrill Lynch unfunded lending commitments. Bank of America 2009 77 Table of Contents Table 41 presents a rollforward of the allowance for credit losses for 2009 and 2008.

(2) Includes small business commercial domestic recoveries of $65 million and $39 million in 2009 and 2008. (3) Allowance for loan and lease losses includes $3.9 billion and $750 million of valuation allowance for consumer purchased impaired loans at December 31, 2009 and 2008. Excluding the valuation allowance for purchased impaired loans, allowance for loan and lease losses as a percentage of total nonperforming loans and leases would have been 99 percent and 136 percent at December 31, 2009 and 2008. For more information on the impact of purchased impaired loans on asset quality, see Consumer Portfolio Credit Risk Management beginning on page 54 and Commercial Portfolio Credit Risk Management beginning on page 64. (4) The 2009 amount includes a $750 million reduction in the allowance for loan and lease losses related to credit card loans of $8.5 billion which were exchanged for a $7.8 billion held-to-maturity debt security that was issued by the Corporation U.S. Credit Card Securitization Trust and retained by the Corporation. This reduction was partially offset by a $340 million increase associated with the reclassification to other assets of the December 31, 2008 amount expected to be reimbursed under residential mortgage cash collateralized synthetic securitizations. The 2008 amount includes the $1.2 billion addition of the Countrywide allowance for loan losses as of July 1, 2008. (5) The 2009 amount represents the fair value of the acquired Merrill Lynch unfunded lending commitments excluding those accounted for under the fair value option, net of accretion and the impact of funding previously unfunded portions. (6) Outstanding loan and lease balances and ratios do not include loans accounted for under the fair value option. Loans measured at fair value were $4.9 billion and $5.4 billion at December 31, 2009 and 2008. Average loans measured at fair value were $6.9 billion and $4.9 billion for 2009 and 2008. n/a = not applicable 78 Bank of America 2009 Table of Contents For reporting purposes, we allocate the allowance for credit losses across products.

(5) Includes $3.9 billion and $750 million related to purchased impaired loans at December 31, 2009 and 2008. Market Risk Management Market risk is the risk that values of assets and liabilities or revenues will be adversely affected by changes in market conditions such as market movements. This risk is inherent in the financial instruments associated with our operations and/or activities including loans, deposits, securities, short-term borrowings, long-term debt, trading account assets and liabilities, and derivatives. Market-sensitive assets and liabilities are generated through loans and deposits associated with our traditional banking business, customer and other trading operations, ALM process, credit risk mitigation activities and mortgage banking activities. In the event of market volatility, factors such as underlying market movements and liquidity have an impact on the results of the Corporation. Our traditional banking loan and deposit products are nontrading positions and are generally reported at amortized cost for assets or the amount owed for liabilities (historical cost). However, these positions are still subject to changes in economic value based on varying market conditions, primarily changes in the levels of interest rates. The risk of adverse changes in the economic value of our nontrading positions is managed through our ALM activities. We have elected to account for certain assets and liabilities under the fair value option. For further information on the fair value of certain financial assets and liabilities, see Note 20 Fair Value Measurements to the Consolidated Financial Statements. Our trading positions are reported at fair value with changes currently reflected in income. Trading positions are subject to various risk factors, which include exposures to interest rates and foreign exchange rates, as well as mortgage, equity, commodity, issuer and market liquidity risk factors. We seek to mitigate these risk exposures by using techniques that encompass a variety of financial instruments in both the cash and derivatives markets. The following discusses the key risk components along with respective risk mitigation techniques. Interest Rate Risk Interest rate risk represents exposures to instruments whose values vary with the level or volatility of interest rates. These instruments include, but are not limited to, loans, debt securities, certain trading-related assets and liabilities, deposits, borrowings and derivative instruments. Hedging instruments used to mitigate these risks include related derivatives such as options, futures, forwards and swaps. Foreign Exchange Risk Foreign exchange risk represents exposures to changes in the values of current holdings and future cash flows denominated in other currencies. The types of instruments exposed to this risk include investments in foreign subsidiaries, foreign currency-denominated loans and securities, future cash flows in foreign currencies arising from foreign exchange transactions, foreign currency-denominated debt and various foreign exchange derivative instruments whose values fluctuate with changes in the level or volatility of currency exchange rates or foreign interest rates. Hedging instruments used to mitigate this risk include foreign exchange options, currency swaps, futures, forwards, foreign currency- denominated debt and deposits. Bank of America 2009 79 Table of Contents Mortgage Risk Mortgage risk represents exposures to changes in the value of mortgage-related instruments. The values of these instruments are sensitive to prepayment rates, mortgage rates, agency debt ratings, default, market liquidity, other interest rates and interest rate volatility. Our exposure to these instruments takes several forms. First, we trade and engage in market-making activities in a variety of mortgage securities including whole loans, pass-through certificates, commercial mortgages, and CMOs including CDOs using mortgages as underlying collateral. Second, we originate a variety of MBS which involves the accumulation of mortgage-related loans in anticipation of eventual securitization. Third, we may hold positions in mortgage securities and residential mortgage loans as part of the ALM portfolio. Fourth, we create MSRs as part of our mortgage origination activities. See Note 1 Summary of Significant Accounting Principles and Note 22 Mortgage Servicing Rights to the Consolidated Financial Statements for additional information on MSRs. Hedging instruments used to mitigate this risk include options, futures, forwards, swaps, swaptions and securities. Equity Market Risk Equity market risk represents exposures to securities that represent an ownership interest in a corporation in the form of domestic and foreign common stock or other equity-linked instruments. Instruments that would lead to this exposure include, but are not limited to, the following: common stock, exchange traded funds, American Depositary Receipts, convertible bonds, listed equity options (puts and calls), over-the-counter equity options, equity total return swaps, equity index futures and other equity derivative products. Hedging instruments used to mitigate this risk include options, futures, swaps, convertible bonds and cash positions. Commodity Risk Commodity risk represents exposures to instruments traded in the petroleum, natural gas, power and metals markets. These instruments consist primarily of futures, forwards, swaps and options. Hedging instruments used to mitigate this risk include options, futures and swaps in the same or similar commodity product, as well as cash positions. Issuer Credit Risk Issuer credit risk represents exposures to changes in the creditworthiness of individual issuers or groups of issuers. Our portfolio is exposed to issuer credit risk where the value of an asset may be adversely impacted by changes in the levels of credit spreads, by credit migration, or by defaults. Hedging instruments used to mitigate this risk include bonds, CDS and other credit fixed income instruments. Market Liquidity Risk Market liquidity risk represents the risk that expected market activity changes dramatically and, in certain cases, may even cease to exist. This exposes us to the risk that we will not be able to transact in an orderly manner and may impact our results. This impact could further be exacerbated if expected hedging or pricing correlations are impacted by the disproportionate demand or lack of demand for certain instruments. We utilize various risk mitigating techniques as discussed in more detail in Trading Risk Management. Trading Risk Management Trading-related revenues represent the amount earned from trading positions, including market-based net interest income, which are taken in a diverse range of financial instruments and markets. Trading account assets and liabilities and derivative positions are reported at fair value. For more information on fair value, see Note 20 Fair Value Measurements to the Consolidated Financial Statements. Trading-related revenues can be volatile and are largely driven by general market conditions and customer demand. Trading-related revenues are dependent on the volume and type of transactions, the level of risk assumed, and the volatility of price and rate movements at any given time within the ever-changing market environment. The Global Markets Risk Committee (GRC), chaired by the Global Markets Risk Executive, has been designated by ALMRC as the primary governance authority for Global Markets Risk Management including trading risk management. The GRC focus is to take a forward-looking view of the primary credit and market risks impacting Global Markets and prioritize those that need a proactive risk mitigation strategy. Market risks that impact lines of business outside of Global Markets are monitored and governed by their respective governance authorities. At the GRC meetings, the committee considers significant daily revenues and losses by business along with an explanation of the primary driver of the revenue or loss. Thresholds are established for each of our businesses in order to determine if the revenue or loss is considered to be significant for that business. If any of the thresholds are exceeded, an explanation of the variance is made to the GRC. The thresholds are developed in coordination with the respective risk managers to highlight those revenues or losses which exceed what is considered to be normal daily income statement volatility. 80 Bank of America 2009 Table of Contents The following histogram is a graphic depiction of trading volatility and illustrates the daily level of trading-related revenue for the twelve months ended December 31, 2009 as compared with the twelve months ended December 31, 2008. During the twelve months ended December 31, 2009, positive trading-related revenue was recorded for 88 percent of the trading days of which 72 percent were daily trading gains of over $25 million, six percent of the trading days had losses greater than $25 million and the largest loss was $100 million. This can be compared to the twelve months ended December 31, 2008, where positive trading-related revenue was recorded for 66 percent of the trading days of which 39 percent were daily trading gains of over $25 million, 17 percent of the trading days had losses greater than $25 million and the largest loss was $173 million. The increase in daily trading gains of over $25 million in 2009 compared to 2008 was driven by more favorable market conditions. To evaluate risk in our trading activities, we focus on the actual and potential volatility of individual positions as well as portfolios. VAR is a key statistic used to measure market risk. In order to manage day-to-day risks, VAR is subject to trading limits both for our overall trading portfolio and within individual businesses. All limit excesses are communicated to management for review. A VAR model simulates the value of a portfolio under a range of hypothetical scenarios in order to generate a distribution of potential gains and losses. VAR represents the worst loss the portfolio is expected to experience based on historical trends with a given level of confidence and depends on the volatility of the positions in the portfolio and on how strongly their risks are correlated. Within any VAR model, there are significant and numerous assumptions that will differ from company to company. In addition, the accuracy of a VAR model depends on the availability and quality of historical data for each of the positions in the portfolio. A VAR model may require additional modeling assumptions for new products which do not have extensive historical price data or for illiquid positions for which accurate daily prices are not consistently available. A VAR model is an effective tool in estimating ranges of potential gains and losses on our trading portfolios. There are however many limitations inherent in a VAR model as it utilizes historical results over a defined time period to estimate future performance. Historical results may not always be indicative of future results and changes in market conditions or in the composition of the underlying portfolio could have a material impact on the accuracy of the VAR model. To ensure that the VAR model reflects current market conditions, we update the historical data underlying our VAR model on a bi-weekly basis and regularly review the assumptions underlying the model. We continually review, evaluate and enhance our VAR model to ensure that it reflects the material risks in our trading portfolio. Nevertheless, due to the limitations mentioned above, we have historically used the VAR model as only one of the components in managing our trading risk and also use other techniques such as stress testing and desk level limits. Periods of extreme market stress influence the reliability of these techniques to various degrees. The accuracy of the VAR methodology is reviewed by backtesting (i.e., comparing actual results against expectations derived from historical data) the VAR results against the daily profit and loss. Graphic representation of the backtesting results with additional explanation of backtesting excesses are reported to the GRC. Backtesting excesses occur when trading losses exceed VAR. Senior management reviews and evaluates the results of these tests. Bank of America 2009 81 Table of Contents The following graph shows daily trading-related revenue and VAR for the twelve months ended December 31, 2009. Actual losses did not exceed daily trading VAR in the twelve months ended December 31, 2009. Actual losses exceeded daily trading VAR two times in the twelve months ended December 31, 2008. (1) Our VAR model uses a historical simulation approach based on three years of historical data and an expected shortfall methodology equivalent to a 99 percent confidence level. Statistically, this means that losses will exceed VAR, on average, one out of 100 trading days, or two to three times each year. Table 43 presents average, high and low daily trading VAR for 2009 and 2008. Table 43 Trading Activities Market Risk VAR 2009 2008 VAR VAR (Dollars in millions) Average High (1) Low (1) Average High (1) Low (1) Foreign exchange $ 20.3 $ 55.4 $ 6.1 $ 7.7 $ 11.7 $ 5.0 Interest rate 73.7 136.7 43.6 28.9 68.3 12.4 Credit 183.3 338.7 123.9 84.6 185.2 44.1 Real estate/mortgage 51.1 81.3 32.4 22.7 43.1 12.8 Equities 44.6 87.6 23.6 28.0 63.9 15.5 Commodities 20.2 29.1 16.0 8.2 17.7 2.4 Portfolio diversification (187.0 ) (69.4 ) Total market-based trading portfolio (2) $ 206.2 $ 325.2 $ 117.9 $ 110.7 $ 255.7 $ 64.1 (1) The high and low for the total portfolio may not equal the sum of the individual components as the highs or lows of the individual portfolios may have occurred on different trading days. (2) The table above does not include credit protection purchased to manage our counterparty credit risk. The increase in average VAR during 2009 as compared to 2008 resulted from the acquisition of Merrill Lynch. In periods of market stress, the GRC members communicate daily to discuss losses and VAR limit excesses. As a result of this process, the lines of business may selectively reduce risk. Where economically feasible, positions are sold or macroeconomic hedges are executed to reduce the exposure. Counterparty credit risk is an adjustment to the mark-to-market value of our derivative exposures reflecting the impact of the credit quality of counterparties on our derivative assets. Since counterparty credit exposure is not included in the VAR component of the regulatory capital allocation, we do not include it in our trading VAR, and it is therefore not included in the daily trading-related revenue illustrated in our histogram or used for backtesting. Trading Portfolio Stress Testing Because the very nature of a VAR model suggests results can exceed our estimates, we also stress test our portfolio. Stress testing estimates the value change in our trading portfolio that may result from abnormal market movements. Various scenarios, categorized as either historical or hypothetical, are regularly run and reported for the overall trading portfolio and individual businesses. Historical scenarios simulate the impact of price changes which occurred during a set of extended historical market events. Generally, a 10-business-day window or longer, representing the most severe point during the crisis, is selected for each historical scenario. Hypothetical scenarios provide simulations of anticipated shocks from predefined market stress events. These stress events include shocks to underlying market risk variables which may be well beyond the shocks found in the historical data used to calculate the VAR. As with the histor - - 82 Bank of America 2009 Table of Contents ical scenarios, the hypothetical scenarios are designed to represent a short-term market disruption. Scenarios are reviewed and updated as necessary in light of changing positions and new economic or political information. In addition to the value afforded by the results themselves, this information provides senior management with a clear picture of the trend of risk being taken given the relatively static nature of the shocks applied. Stress testing for the trading portfolio is also integrated with the enterprise-wide stress testing. A process has been established to ensure consistency between the scenarios used for the trading portfolio and those used for enterprise-wide stress testing. The scenarios used for enterprise-wide stress testing purposes differ from the typical trading portfolio scenarios in that they have a longer time horizon and the results are forecasted over multiple periods for use in consolidated capital and liquidity planning. For additional information on enterprise-wide stress testing, see page 50. Interest Rate Risk Management for Nontrading Activities Interest rate risk represents the most significant market risk exposure to our nontrading exposures. Our overall goal is to manage interest rate risk so that movements in interest rates do not adversely affect core net interest income managed basis. Interest rate risk is measured as the potential volatility in our core net interest income managed basis caused by changes in market interest rates. Client-facing activities, primarily lending and deposit-taking, create interest rate sensitive positions on our balance sheet. Interest rate risk from these activities, as well as the impact of changing market conditions, is managed through our ALM activities. Simulations are used to estimate the impact on core net interest income managed basis using numerous interest rate scenarios, balance sheet trends and strategies. These simulations evaluate how these scenarios impact core net interest income managed basis on short-term financial instruments, debt securities, loans, deposits, borrowings and derivative instruments. In addition, these simulations incorporate assumptions about balance sheet dynamics such as loan and deposit growth and pricing, changes in funding mix, and asset and liability repricing and maturity characteristics. These simulations do not include the impact of hedge ineffectiveness. Management analyzes core net interest income managed basis forecasts utilizing different rate scenarios with the baseline utilizing the forward interest rates. Management frequently updates the core net interest income managed basis forecast for changing assumptions and differing outlooks based on economic trends and market conditions. Thus, we continually monitor our balance sheet position in an effort to maintain an acceptable level of exposure to interest rate changes. We prepare forward-looking forecasts of core net interest income managed basis. These baseline forecasts take into consideration expected future business growth, ALM positioning, and the direction of interest rate movements as implied by forward interest rates. We then measure and evaluate the impact that alternative interest rate scenarios have on these static baseline forecasts in order to assess interest rate sensitivity under varied conditions. The spot and 12-month forward monthly rates used in our respective baseline forecasts at December 31, 2009 and 2008 are presented in the following table. Table 44 Forward Rates December 31 2009 2008 Federal Funds Three- Month LIBOR 10-Year Swap Federal Funds Three- Month LIBOR 10-Year Swap Spot rates 0.25 % 0.25 % 3.97 % 0.25 % 1.43 % 2.56 % 12-month forward rates 1.14 1.53 4.47 0.75 1.41 2.80 During 2009, the spread between the spot three-month London InterBank Offered Rate (LIBOR) and the Federal Funds target rate converged. We are typically asset sensitive to Federal Funds and Prime rates, and liability sensitive to LIBOR. Net interest income benefits as the spread between Federal Funds and LIBOR narrows. Table 45 below reflects the pre-tax dollar impact to forecasted core net interest income managed basis over the next twelve months from December 31, 2009 and 2008, resulting from a 100 bp gradual parallel increase, a 100 bp gradual parallel decrease, a 100 bp gradual curve flattening (increase in short-term rates or decrease in long-term rates) and a 100 bp gradual curve steepening (decrease in short-term rates or increase in long-term rates) from the forward market curve. For further discussion of core net interest income managed basis see page 27.

The estimated exposure is reported on a managed basis and reflects impacts that may be realized primarily in net interest income and card income on the Consolidated Statement of Income. This sensitivity analysis excludes any impact that could occur in the valuation of retained interests in the Corporation securitizations due to changes in interest rate levels. For additional information on securitizations, see Note 8 Securitizations to the Consolidated Financial Statements. Our core net interest income managed basis was asset sensitive to a parallel move in interest rates at both December 31, 2009 and 2008. Beyond what is already implied in the forward market curve, the interest rate risk position has become more exposed to declining rates since December 31, 2008 driven by the acquisition of Merrill Lynch and the actions taken to strengthen our capital and liquidity position. As part of our ALM activities, we use securities, residential mortgages, and interest rate and foreign exchange derivatives in managing interest rate sensitivity. Securities The securities portfolio is an integral part of our ALM position and is primarily comprised of debt securities and includes MBS and to a lesser extent corporate, municipal and other investment grade debt securities. At December 31, 2009, AFS debt securities were $301.6 billion compared to $276.9 billion at December 31, 2008. During 2009 and 2008, we purchased AFS debt securities of $185.1 billion and $184.2 billion, sold $159.4 billion and $119.8 billion, and had maturities and received paydowns of $59.9 billion and $26.1 billion. We realized $4.7 billion and $1.1 billion in gains on sales of debt securities during 2009 and 2008. In addition, we securitized $14.0 billion and $26.1 billion of residential mortgage loans into MBS which we retained during 2009 and 2008. Accumulated OCI includes $1.5 billion in after-tax gains at December 31, 2009, including $628 million of net unrealized losses related to AFS debt securities and $2.1 billion of net unrealized gains related to AFS marketable equity securities. Total market value of the AFS debt securities was $301.6 billion at December 31, 2009 with a weighted-average duration of 4.5 years and primarily relates to our MBS portfolio. The amount of pre-tax accumulated OCI loss related to AFS debt securities decreased by $8.3 billion during 2009 to $1.0 billion. For those securities that are in an unrealized loss position, we have the intent and ability to hold these securities to recovery and it is more likely than not that we will not be required to sell the securities prior to recovery. We recognized $2.8 billion of other-than-temporary impairment losses through earnings on AFS debt securities during 2009 compared to $3.5 billion during 2008. We also recognized $326 million of other-than-temporary impairment losses on AFS marketable equity securities during 2009 compared to $661 million during 2008. The impairment of AFS debt and marketable equity securities is based on a variety of factors, including the length of time and extent to which the market value has been less than cost; the financial condition of the issuer of the security and its ability to recover market value; and our intent and ability to hold the security to recovery. Based on our evaluation of the above and other relevant factors, and after consideration of the losses described in the paragraph above, we do not believe that the AFS debt and marketable equity securities that are in an unrealized loss position at December 31, 2009 are other-than-temporarily impaired. We adopted new accounting guidance related to the recognition and presentation of other-than-temporary impairment of debt securities as of January 1, 2009. As prescribed by the new guidance, at December 31, 2009, we recognized the credit component of other-than-temporary impairment of debt securities in earnings and the non-credit component in OCI for those securities which we do not intend to sell and it is more likely than not that we will not be required to sell the security prior to recovery. For more information on the adoption of the new guidance, see Note 1 Summary of Significant Accounting Principles to the Consolidated Financial Statements. Residential Mortgage Portfolio At December 31, 2009, residential mortgages were $242.1 billion compared to $248.1 billion at December 31, 2008. We retained $26.6 billion and $27.3 billion in first mortgages originated by Home Loans & Insurance during 2009 and 2008. We securitized $14.0 billion and $26.1 billion of residential mortgage loans into MBS which we retained during 2009 and 2008. During 2009, we had no purchases of residential mortgages related to ALM activities compared to purchases of $405 million during 2008. We sold $5.9 billion of residential mortgages during 2009 of which $5.1 billion were originated residential mortgages and $771 million were previously purchased from third parties. These sales resulted in gains of $47 million. This compares to sales of $30.7 billion during 2008 which were comprised of $22.9 billion in originated residential mortgages and $7.8 billion in mortgages previously purchased from third parties. These sales resulted in gains of $496 million. We received paydowns of $42.3 billion and $26.3 billion in 2009 and 2008. In addition to the residential mortgage portfolio, we incorporated the discontinued real estate portfolio that was acquired in connection with the Countrywide acquisition into our ALM activities. This portfolio balance was $14.9 billion and $20.0 billion at December 31, 2009 and 2008. Interest Rate and Foreign Exchange Derivative Contracts Interest rate and foreign exchange derivative contracts are utilized in our ALM activities and serve as an efficient tool to manage our interest rate and foreign exchange risk. We use derivatives to hedge the variability in cash flows or changes in fair value on our balance sheet due to interest rate and foreign exchange components. For additional information on our hedging activities, see Note 4 Derivatives to the Consolidated Financial Statements. Our interest rate contracts are generally non-leveraged generic interest rate and foreign exchange basis swaps, options, futures and forwards. In addition, we use foreign exchange contracts, including cross-currency interest rate swaps and foreign currency forward contracts, to mitigate the foreign exchange risk associated with foreign currency-denominated assets and liabilities. Table 46 reflects the notional amounts, fair value, weighted-average receive fixed and pay fixed rates, expected maturity and estimated duration of our open ALM derivatives at December 31, 2009 and 2008. These amounts do not include derivative hedges on our net investments in consolidated foreign operations and MSRs. Changes to the composition of our derivatives portfolio during 2009 reflect actions taken for interest rate and foreign exchange rate risk management. The decisions to reposition our derivatives portfolio are based upon the current assessment of economic and financial conditions including the interest rate environment, balance sheet composition and trends, and the relative mix of our cash and derivative positions. The notional amount of our option positions increased to $6.5 billion at December 31, 2009 from $5.0 billion at December 31, 2008. Changes in the levels of the option positions were driven by swaptions acquired as a result of the Merrill Lynch acquisition. Our interest rate swap positions (including foreign exchange contracts) were a net receive fixed position of $52.2 billion at December 31, 2009 compared to a net receive fixed position of $50.3 billion at December 31, 2008. Changes in the notional levels of our interest rate swap position were driven by the net addition of 84 Bank of America 2009 Table of Contents $104.4 billion in pay fixed swaps, $83.4 billion in U.S. dollar-denominated receive fixed swaps and the net addition of $22.9 billion in foreign currency-denominated receive fixed swaps. The notional amount of our foreign exchange basis swaps was $122.8 billion and $54.6 billion at December 31, 2009 and 2008. The $42.9 billion increase in same-currency basis swap positions was primarily due to the acquisition of Merrill Lynch. Our futures and forwards net notional position, which reflects the net of long and short positions, was a long position of $10.6 billion compared to a short position of $8.8 billion at December 31, 2008. The following table includes derivatives utilized in our ALM activities including those designated as accounting and economic hedging instruments. The fair value of net ALM contracts increased $5.8 billion to a gain of $12.3 billion at December 31, 2009 from a gain of $6.4 billion at December 31, 2008. The increase was primarily attributable to changes in the value of U.S. dollar-denominated receive fixed interest rate swaps of $1.9 billion, foreign exchange basis swaps of $1.4 billion, pay fixed interest rate swaps of $1.2 billion, foreign exchange contracts of $1.1 billion, option products of $174 million and same-currency basis swaps of $107 million. The increase was partially offset by a loss from changes in the value of futures and forward rate contracts of $66 million.

At December 31, 2008, there were no forward starting pay or receive fixed swap positions. (2) Does not include basis adjustments on fixed-rate debt issued by the Corporation and hedged under fair value hedges pursuant to derivatives designated as hedging instruments that substantially offset the fair values of these derivatives. (3) At December 31, 2009, same-currency basis swaps consist of $42.9 billion in both foreign currency and U.S. dollar-denominated basis swaps in which both sides of the swap are in the same currency. There were no same-currency basis swaps at December 31, 2008. (4) Foreign exchange basis swaps consist of cross-currency variable interest rate swaps used separately or in conjunction with receive fixed interest rate swaps. (5) Does not include foreign currency translation adjustments on certain foreign debt issued by the Corporation which substantially offset the fair values of these derivatives.

Option products of $5.0 billion at December 31, 2008 are comprised completely of purchased caps. (7) Foreign exchange contracts include foreign currency-denominated and cross-currency receive fixed interest rate swaps as well as foreign currency forward rate contracts. Total notional was comprised of $46.0 billion in foreign currency-denominated and cross-currency receive fixed swaps and $57.7 billion in foreign currency forward rate contracts at December 31, 2009, and $23.1 billion in foreign currency-denominated and cross-currency receive fixed swaps and $78 million in foreign currency forward rate contracts at December 31, 2008. (8) Reflects the net of long and short positions. Bank of America 2009 85 Table of Contents We use interest rate derivative instruments to hedge the variability in the cash flows of our assets and liabilities, and other forecasted transactions (cash flow hedges). From time to time, we also utilize equity-indexed derivatives accounted for as derivatives designated as cash flow hedges to minimize exposure to price fluctuations on the forecasted purchase or sale of certain equity investments. The net losses on both open and terminated derivative instruments recorded in accumulated OCI, net-of-tax, were $2.5 billion and $3.5 billion at December 31, 2009 and 2008. These net losses are expected to be reclassified into earnings in the same period when the hedged cash flows affect earnings and will decrease income or increase expense on the respective hedged cash flows. Assuming no change in open cash flow derivative hedge positions and no changes to prices or interest rates beyond what is implied in forward yield curves at December 31, 2009, the pre-tax net losses are expected to be reclassified into earnings as follows: $937 million, or 23 percent within the next year, 66 percent within five years, and 88 percent within 10 years, with the remaining 12 percent thereafter. For more information on derivatives designated as cash flow hedges, see Note 4 Derivatives to the Consolidated Financial Statements. In addition to the derivatives disclosed in Table 46 we hedge our net investment in consolidated foreign operations determined to have functional currencies other than the U.S. dollar using forward foreign exchange contracts that typically settle in 90 days, cross currency basis swaps and by issuing foreign currency-denominated debt. We recorded after-tax losses from derivatives and foreign currency-denominated debt in accumulated OCI associated with net investment hedges which was offset by after-tax unrealized gains in accumulated OCI associated for changes in the value of our net investments in consolidated foreign entities at December 31, 2009. Mortgage Banking Risk Management We originate, fund and service mortgage loans, which subject us to credit, liquidity and interest rate risks, among others. We determine whether loans will be held for investment or held for sale at the time of commitment and manage credit and liquidity risks by selling or securitizing a portion of the loans we originate. Interest rate and market risk can be substantial in the mortgage business. Fluctuations in interest rates drive consumer demand for new mortgages and the level of refinancing activity, which in turn affects total origination and service fee income. Typically, a decline in mortgage interest rates will lead to an increase in mortgage originations and fees and a decrease in the value of the MSRs driven by higher prepayment expectations. Hedging the various sources of interest rate risk in mortgage banking is a complex process that requires complex modeling and ongoing monitoring. IRLCs and the related residential first mortgage LHFS are subject to interest rate risk between the date of the IRLC and the date the loans are sold to the secondary market. To hedge interest rate risk, we utilize forward loan sale commitments and other derivative instruments including purchased options. These instruments are used as economic hedges of IRLCs and residential first mortgage LHFS. At December 31, 2009 and 2008, the notional amount of derivatives economically hedging the IRLCs and residential first mortgage LHFS was $161.4 billion and $97.2 billion. MSRs are nonfinancial assets created when the underlying mortgage loan is sold to investors and we retain the right to service the loan. We use certain derivatives such as interest rate options, interest rate swaps, forward settlement contracts, euro dollar futures, as well as mortgage-backed and U.S. Treasury securities as economic hedges of MSRs. The notional amounts of the derivative contracts and other securities designated as economic hedges of MSRs at December 31, 2009 were $1.3 trillion and $67.6 billion, for a total notional amount of $1.4 trillion. At December 31, 2008, the notional amounts of the derivative contracts and other securities designated as economic hedges of MSRs were $1.0 trillion and $87.5 billion, for a total notional amount of $1.1 trillion. In 2009, we recorded losses in mortgage banking income of $3.8 billion related to the change in fair value of these economic hedges as compared to gains of $8.6 billion for 2008. For additional information on MSRs, see Note 22 Mortgage Servicing Rights to the Consolidated Financial Statements and for more information on mortgage banking income, see the Home Loans & Insurance discussion beginning on page 31. Compliance Risk Management Compliance risk is the risk posed by the failure to manage regulatory, legal and ethical issues that could result in monetary damages, losses or harm to our reputation or image. The Seven Elements of a Compliance Program provides the framework for the compliance programs that are consistently applied across the enterprise to manage compliance risk. This framework includes a common approach to commitment and accountability, policies and procedures, controls and supervision, monitoring, regulatory change management, education and awareness and reporting. We approach compliance risk management on an enterprise and line of business level. The Operational Risk Committee provides oversight of significant compliance risk issues. Within Global Risk Management, Global Compliance Risk Management develops and guides the strategies, policies and practices for assessing and managing compliance risks across the organization. Through education and communication efforts, a culture of compliance is emphasized across the organization. We also mitigate compliance risk through a broad-based approach to process management and improvement. The lines of business are responsible for all the risks within the business line, including compliance risks. Compliance Risk executives, working in conjunction with senior line of business executives, have developed key tools to address and measure compliance risks and to ensure compliance with laws and regulations in each line of business. Operational Risk Management Operational risk is the risk of loss resulting from inadequate or failed internal processes, people, systems or external events. Successful operational risk management is particularly important to diversified financial services companies because of the nature, volume and complexity of the financial services business. Under the Basel II Rules, an operational loss event is an event that results in loss and is associated with any of the following seven operational loss event categories: internal fraud; external fraud; employment practices and workplace safety; clients, products and business practices; damage to physical assets; business disruption and system failures; and execution, delivery and process management. Losses in these categories are captured and mapped to four overall risk categories: people, process, systems and external events. Specific examples of loss events include robberies, internal fraud, processing errors and physical losses from natural disasters. We approach operational risk management from two perspectives: the enterprise and line of business. The Operational Risk Committee, which reports to the Audit Committee of the Board, is responsible for operational risk policies, measurement and management, and control processes. Within Global Risk Management, Global Operational Risk Management develops and guides the strategies, policies, practices, controls and monitoring tools for assessing and managing operational risks across the organization. For selected risks, we use specialized support groups, such as Enterprise Information Management and Supply Chain Management, to 86 Bank of America 2009 Table of Contents develop risk management practices, such as an information security program and a supplier program to ensure that suppliers adopt appropriate policies and procedures when performing work on our behalf. These specialized groups also assist the lines of business in the development and implementation of risk management practices specific to the needs of the individual businesses. These groups also work with line of business executives and risk executives to develop and guide appropriate strategies, policies, practices, controls and monitoring tools for each line of business. Additionally, where appropriate, we purchase insurance policies to mitigate the impact of operational losses when and if they occur. These insurance policies are explicitly incorporated in the structural features of our operational risk evaluation. As insurance recoveries, especially given recent market events, are subject to legal and financial uncertainty, the inclusion of these insurance policies are subject to reductions in the mitigating benefits expected within our operational risk evaluation. The lines of business are responsible for all the risks within the business line, including operational risks. Operational risk executives, working in conjunction with senior line of business executives, have developed key tools to help identify, measure, mitigate and monitor risk in each line of business. Examples of these include personnel management practices, data reconciliation processes, fraud management units, transaction processing monitoring and analysis, business recovery planning and new product introduction processes. In addition, the lines of business are responsible for monitoring adherence to corporate practices. Line of business management uses a self-assessment process, which helps to identify and evaluate the status of risk and control issues, including mitigation plans, as appropriate. The goal of the self-assessment process is to periodically assess changing market and business conditions, to evaluate key risks impacting each line of business and assess the controls in place to mitigate the risks. In addition to information gathered from the self-assessment process, key operational risk indicators have been developed and are used to help identify trends and issues on both an enterprise and a line of business level. ASF Framework In December 2007, the American Securitization Forum (ASF) issued the Streamlined Foreclosure and Loss Avoidance Framework for Securitized Adjustable Rate Mortgage Loans (the ASF Framework). The ASF Framework was developed to address a large number of subprime loans that are at risk of default when the loans reset from their initial fixed interest rates to variable rates. The objective of the framework is to provide uniform guidelines for evaluating a large number of loans for refinancing in an efficient manner while complying with the relevant tax regulations and off-balance sheet accounting standards for loan securitizations. The ASF Framework targets loans that were originated between January 1, 2005 and July 31, 2007, have an initial fixed interest rate period of 36 months or less and which are scheduled for their first interest rate reset between January 1, 2008 and July 31, 2010. The ASF Framework categorizes the targeted loans into three segments. Segment 1 includes loans where the borrower is likely to be able to refinance into any available mortgage product. Segment 2 includes loans where the borrower is current but is unlikely to be able to refinance into any readily available mortgage product. Segment 3 includes loans where the borrower is not current. If certain criteria are met, ASF Framework loans in Segment 2 are eligible for fast-track modification under which the interest rate will be kept at the existing initial rate, generally for five years following the interest rate reset date. Upon evaluation, if targeted loans do not meet specific criteria to be eligible for one of the three segments, they are categorized as other loans, as shown in the table below. These criteria include the occupancy status of the borrower, structure and other terms of the loan. In January 2008, the SEC Office of the Chief Accountant issued a letter addressing the accounting issues relating to the ASF Framework. The letter concluded that the SEC would not object to continuing off-balance sheet accounting treatment for Segment 2 loans modified pursuant to the ASF Framework. For those current loans that are accounted for off-balance sheet that are modified, but not as part of the ASF Framework, the servicer must perform on an individual basis, an analysis of the borrower and the loan to demonstrate it is probable that the borrower will not meet the repayment obligation in the near term. Such analysis provides sufficient evidence to demonstrate that the loan is in imminent or reasonably foreseeable default. The SEC Office of the Chief Accountant issued a letter in July 2007 stating that it would not object to continuing off-balance sheet accounting treatment for these loans. Prior to the acquisition of Countrywide on July 1, 2008, Countrywide began making fast-track loan modifications under Segment 2 of the ASF Framework in June 2008 and the off-balance sheet accounting treatment of QSPEs that hold those loans was not affected. In addition, other workout activities relating to subprime ARMs including modifications (e.g., interest rate reductions and capitalization of interest) and repayment plans were also made. These initiatives have continued subsequent to the acquisition in an effort to work with all of our customers that are eligible and affected by loans that meet the requisite criteria. These foreclosure prevention efforts will reduce foreclosures and the related losses providing a solution for customers and protecting investors. As of December 31, 2009, the principal balance of beneficial interests issued by the QSPEs that hold subprime ARMs totaled $70.5 billion and the fair value of beneficial interests related to those QSPEs held by the Corporation totaled $9 million. The following table presents a summary of loans in QSPEs that hold subprime ARMs as of December 31, 2009 as well as workout and other activity for the subprime loans by ASF categorization for 2009. Prior to the acquisition of Countrywide on July 1, 2008, we did not originate or service significant subprime residential mortgage loans, nor did we hold a significant amount of beneficial interests in QSPEs of subprime residential mortgage loans.

Many of our significant accounting principles require complex judgments to estimate the values of assets and liabilities. We have procedures and processes in place to facilitate making these judgments. The more judgmental estimates are summarized below. We have identified and described the development of the variables most important in the estimation processes that, with the exception of accrued taxes, involve mathematical models to derive the estimates. In many cases, there are numerous alternative judgments that could be used in the process of determining the inputs to the models. Where alternatives exist, we have used the factors that we believe represent the most reasonable value in developing the inputs. Actual performance that differs from our estimates of the key variables could impact net income. Separate from the possible future impact to net income from input and model variables, the value of our lending portfolio and market sensitive assets and liabilities may change subsequent to the balance sheet date, often significantly, due to the nature and magnitude of future credit and market conditions. Such credit and market conditions may change quickly and in unforeseen ways and the resulting volatility could have a significant, negative effect on future operating results. These fluctuations would not be indicative of deficiencies in our models or inputs. Allowance for Credit Losses The allowance for credit losses, which includes the allowance for loan and lease losses and the reserve for unfunded lending commitments, represents management estimate of probable losses inherent in the Corporation lending activities excluding those accounted for under the fair value option. Changes to the allowance for credit losses are reported in the Consolidated Statement of Income in the provision for credit losses. Our process for determining the allowance for credit losses is discussed in the Credit Risk Management section beginning on page 54 and Note 1 Summary of Significant Accounting Principles to the Consolidated Financial Statements. Due to the variability in the drivers of the assumptions used in this process, estimates of the portfolio inherent risks and overall collectability change with changes in the economy, individual industries, countries and borrowers or counterparties ability and willingness to repay their obligations. The degree to which any particular assumption affects the allowance for credit losses depends on the severity of the change and its relationship to the other assumptions. Key judgments used in determining the allowance for credit losses include: (i) risk ratings for pools of commercial loans and leases, (ii) market and collateral values and discount rates for individually evaluated loans, (iii) product type classifications for consumer and commercial loans and leases, (iv) loss rates used for consumer and commercial loans and leases, (v) adjustments made to address current events and conditions, (vi) considerations regarding domestic and global economic uncertainty, and (vii) overall credit conditions. Our allowance for loan and lease losses is sensitive to the risk ratings assigned to commercial loans and leases. Assuming a downgrade of one level in the internal risk rating for commercial loans and leases, except loans and leases already risk-rated Doubtful as defined by regulatory authorities, the allowance for loan and lease losses would increase by approximately $4.9 billion at December 31, 2009. The allowance for loan and lease losses as a percentage of total loans and leases at December 31, 2009 was 4.16 percent and this hypothetical increase in the allowance would raise the ratio to approximately 4.70 percent. Our allowance for loan and lease losses is also sensitive to the loss rates used for the consumer and commercial portfolios. A 10 percent increase in the loss rates used on the consumer and commercial loan and lease portfolios covered by the allowance would increase the allowance for loan and lease losses at December 31, 2009 by approximately $2.9 billion of which $2.6 billion would relate to consumer and $266 million to commercial. Purchased impaired loans are initially recorded at fair value. Applicable accounting guidance prohibits carry-over or creation of valuation allowances in the initial accounting. However, subsequent decreases in the expected principal cash flows from the date of acquisition result in a charge to the provision for credit losses and a corresponding increase to the allowance for loan and lease losses. Our purchased impaired portfolio is also subjected to stress scenarios to evaluate the potential impact given certain events. A one percent decrease in the expected principal cash flows could result in approximately a $200 million impairment of the portfolio of which approximately $100 million would relate to our discontinued real estate portfolio. These sensitivity analyses do not represent management expectations of the deterioration in risk ratings or the increases in loss rates but are provided as hypothetical scenarios to assess the sensitivity of the allowance for loan and lease losses to changes in key inputs. We believe the risk ratings and loss severities currently in use are appropriate and that the probability of a downgrade of one level of the internal risk ratings for commercial loans and leases within a short period of time is remote. The process of determining the level of the allowance for credit losses requires a high degree of judgment. It is possible that others, given the same information, may at any point in time reach different reasonable conclusions. Mortgage Servicing Rights MSRs are nonfinancial assets that are created when a mortgage loan is sold and we retain the right to service the loan. We account for consumer MSRs at fair value with changes in fair value recorded in the Consolidated Statement of Income in mortgage banking income. Commercial-related and residential reverse mortgage MSRs are accounted for using the amortization method (i.e., lower of cost or market) with impairment recognized as a reduction of mortgage banking income. At December 31, 2009, our total MSR balance was $19.8 billion. We determine the fair value of our consumer MSRs using a valuation model that calculates the present value of estimated future net servicing income. The model incorporates key economic assumptions including estimates of prepayment rates and resultant weighted average lives of the MSRs, and the option-adjusted spread (OAS) levels. These variables can, and generally do change from quarter to quarter as market conditions and projected interest rates change. These assumptions are subjective in nature and changes in these assumptions could materially affect our net income. For example, decreasing the prepayment rate assumption used in the valuation of our consumer MSRs by 10 percent while keeping all other assumptions unchanged could have resulted in an estimated increase of $895 million in mortgage banking income at December 31, 2009. We manage potential changes in the fair value of MSRs through a comprehensive risk management program. The intent is to mitigate the effects of changes in the fair value of MSRs through the use of risk management instruments. To reduce the sensitivity of earnings to interest rate and market value fluctuations, securities as well as certain derivatives such as options and interest rate swaps may be used as economic hedges of the MSRs, but are not designated as accounting hedges. These instruments are carried at fair value with changes in fair value recognized in mortgage banking income. The impact provided above does not reflect any hedge strategies that may be undertaken to mitigate such risk. 88 Bank of America 2009 Table of Contents For additional information on MSRs, including the sensitivity of weighted average lives and the fair value of MSRs to changes in modeled assumptions, see Note 22 Mortgage Servicing Rights to the Consolidated Financial Statements. Fair Value of Financial Instruments We determine the fair values of financial instruments based on the fair value hierarchy under applicable accounting guidance which requires an entity to maximize the use of observable inputs and minimize the use of unobservable inputs when measuring fair value. Applicable accounting guidance establishes three levels of inputs used to measure fair value. We carry trading account assets and liabilities, derivative assets and liabilities, AFS debt and marketable equity securities, certain MSRs, and certain other assets at fair value. Also, we account for certain corporate loans and loan commitments, LHFS, commercial paper and other short-term borrowings, securities financing agreements, asset-backed secured financings, long-term deposits, and long-term debt under the fair value option. For more information, see Note 20 Fair Value Measurements to the Consolidated Financial Statements. The fair values of assets and liabilities include adjustments for market liquidity, credit quality and other deal specific factors, where appropriate. Valuations of products using models or other techniques are sensitive to assumptions used for the significant inputs. Where market data is available, the inputs used for valuation reflect that information as of our valuation date. Inputs to valuation models are considered unobservable if they are supported by little or no market activity. In periods of extreme volatility, lessened liquidity or in illiquid markets, there may be more variability in market pricing or a lack of market data to use in the valuation process. To ensure the prudent application of estimates and management judgment in determining the fair value of assets and liabilities, we have in place various processes and controls that include: a model validation policy that requires review and approval of quantitative models used for deal pricing; financial statement fair value determination and risk quantification; a trading product valuation policy that requires verification of all traded product valuations; and a periodic review and substantiation of daily profit and loss reporting for all traded products. Primarily through validation controls, we utilize both broker and pricing service inputs which can and do include both market-observable and internally-modeled values and/or value inputs. Our reliance on this information is tempered by the knowledge of how the broker and/or pricing service develops its data with a higher degree of reliance applied to those that are more directly observable and lesser reliance applied to those developed through their own internal modeling. Similarly, broker quotes that are executable are given a higher level of reliance than indicative broker quotes, which are not executable. These processes and controls are performed independently of the business. Trading account assets and liabilities are carried at fair value based primarily on actively traded markets where prices are from either direct market quotes or observed transactions. Liquidity is a significant factor in the determination of the fair value of trading account assets and liabilities. Market price quotes may not be readily available for some positions, or positions within a market sector where trading activity has slowed significantly or ceased. Situations of illiquidity generally are triggered by market perception of credit uncertainty regarding a single company or a specific market sector. In these instances, fair value is determined based on limited available market information and other factors, principally from reviewing the issuer financial statements and changes in credit ratings made by one or more of the ratings agencies. Trading account profits (losses), which represent the net amount earned from our trading positions, can be volatile and are largely driven by general market conditions and customer demand. Trading account profits (losses) are dependent on the volume and type of transactions, the level of risk assumed, and the volatility of price and rate movements at any given time within the ever-changing market environment. To evaluate risk in our trading activities, we focus on the actual and potential volatility of individual positions as well as portfolios. At a portfolio and corporate level, we use trading limits, stress testing and tools such as VAR modeling, which estimates a potential daily loss that we do not expect to exceed with a specified confidence level, to measure and manage market risk. For more information on VAR, see Trading Risk Management beginning on page 80. The fair values of derivative assets and liabilities traded in the over-the-counter market are determined using quantitative models that require the use of multiple market inputs including interest rates, prices, and indices to generate continuous yield or pricing curves and volatility factors, which are used to value the positions. The majority of market inputs are actively quoted and can be validated through external sources including brokers, market transactions and third-party pricing services. Estimation risk is greater for derivative asset and liability positions that are either option-based or have longer maturity dates where observable market inputs are less readily available or are unobservable, in which case quantitative-based extrapolations of rate, price or index scenarios are used in determining fair values. The Corporation incorporates within its fair value measurements of over-the-counter derivatives the net credit differential between the counterparty credit risk and our own credit risk. The value of the credit differential is determined by reference to existing direct market reference costs of credit, or where direct references are not available a proxy is applied consistent with direct references for other counterparties that are similar in credit risk. An estimate of severity of loss is also used in the determination of fair value, primarily based on historical experience adjusted for any more recent name specific expectations. Level 3 Assets and Liabilities Financial assets and liabilities whose values are based on prices or valuation techniques that require inputs that are both unobservable and are significant to the overall fair value measurement are classified as Level 3 under the fair value hierarchy established in applicable accounting guidance. The Level 3 financial assets and liabilities include private equity investments, consumer MSRs, ABS, highly structured, complex or long-dated derivative contracts, structured notes and certain CDOs, for which there is not an active market for identical assets from which to determine fair value or where sufficient, current market information about similar assets to use as observable, corroborated data for all significant inputs into a valuation model are not available. In these cases, the fair values of these Level 3 financial assets and liabilities are determined using pricing models, discounted cash flow methodologies, a net asset value approach for certain structured securities, or similar techniques, for which the determination of fair value requires significant management judgment or estimation. In 2009, there were no changes to the quantitative models, or uses of such models, that resulted in a material adjustment to the Consolidated Statement of Income. Level 3 assets, before the impact of counterparty netting related to our derivative positions, were $103.6 billion and $59.4 billion at December 31, 2009 and 2008 and represented approximately 14 percent and 10 percent of assets measured at fair value (or five percent and three percent of total assets). Level 3 liabilities, before the impact of counterparty netting related to our derivative positions, were $21.8 billion and $8.0 billion as of December 31, 2009 and 2008 and represented approximately 10 percent and nine percent of the liabilities measured at fair value (or approximately one percent of total liabilities). At December 31, 2009, $21.1 billion, or 12 percent, of trading account assets were Bank of America 2009 89 Table of Contents classified as Level 3 assets, and $396 million or less than one percent of trading account liabilities were classified as Level 3 liabilities. At December 31, 2009, $23.0 billion, or 29 percent, of derivative assets were classified as Level 3 assets, and $15.2 billion and 35 percent of derivative liabilities were classified as Level 3 liabilities. See Note 20 Fair Value Measurements to the Consolidated Financial Statements for a tabular presentation of the fair values of Level 1, 2 and 3 assets and liabilities at December 31, 2009 and 2008 and detail of Level 3 activity for the years ended December 31, 2009, 2008 and 2007. In 2009, we recognized gains of $10.6 billion on Level 3 assets and liabilities which were primarily gains on net derivatives and consumer MSRs partially offset by losses on long-term debt. We also recorded unrealized gains of $3.3 billion (pre-tax) in accumulated OCI on Level 3 assets and liabilities during the year, which were driven primarily by improved market-observability as liquidity returned to the market related to non-agency MBS. The gains in net derivatives were driven by high origination volumes of held-for-sale mortgage loans and by positive valuation adjustments on our IRLCs. The increase in the consumer MSR balance benefited from changes in the forward interest rate curve. Losses of $2.3 billion on long-term debt were driven by the impact of market movements and from improved credit spreads on certain Merrill Lynch structured notes. Level 3 financial instruments, such as our consumer MSRs, may be economically hedged with derivatives not classified as Level 3, therefore, gains or losses associated with Level 3 financial instruments may be offset by gains or losses associated with financial instruments classified in other levels of the fair value hierarchy. The gains and losses recorded in earnings did not have a significant impact on our liquidity or capital resources. A review of fair value hierarchy classifications is conducted on a quarterly basis. Transfers into or out of Level 3 are made if the significant inputs used in the financial models measuring the fair values of the assets and liabilities became unobservable or observable, respectively, in the current marketplace. These transfers are effective as of the beginning of the quarter. In 2009, several transfers were made into or out of Level 3. Long-term debt of $4.3 billion was transferred out of Level 3 due to the decreased significance of unobservable inputs on certain structured notes. Net derivative assets of $5.7 billion were transferred into Level 3 due to the impact of significant unobservable inputs in the overall valuation of certain derivative products in the marketplace. Global Principal Investments Global Principal Investments is included within Equity Investments in All Other on page 41. Global Principal Investments is comprised of a diversified portfolio of investments in privately-held and publicly-traded companies at all stages of their life cycle. These investments are made either directly in a company or held through a fund. Some of these companies may need access to additional cash to support their long-term business models. Market conditions and company performance may impact whether funding is available from private investors or the capital markets. At December 31, 2009, this portfolio totaled $14.1 billion including $12.4 billion, of non-public investments. Investments with active market quotes are carried at estimated fair value; however, the majority of our investments do not have publicly available price quotes and, therefore, the fair value is unobservable. Valuation of these investments requires significant management judgment. We initially value these investments at transaction price and adjust valuations when evidence is available to support such adjustments. Such evidence includes transactions in similar instruments, market comparables, completed or pending third-party transactions in the underlying investment or comparable entities, subsequent rounds of financing, recapitalizations and other transactions across the capital structure, and changes in financial ratios or cash flows. Invest - - ments are carried at estimated fair value with changes recorded in equity investment income in the Consolidated Statement of Income. Accrued Income Taxes Accrued income taxes, reported as a component of accrued expenses and other liabilities on our Consolidated Balance Sheet, represents the net amount of current income taxes we expect to pay to or receive from various taxing jurisdictions attributable to our operations to date. We currently file income tax returns in more than 100 jurisdictions and consider many factors including statutory, judicial and regulatory guidance , in estimating the appropriate accrued income taxes for each jurisdiction. In applying the applicable accounting guidance, we monitor relevant tax authorities and change our estimate of accrued income taxes due to changes in income tax laws and their interpretation by the courts and regulatory authorities. These revisions of our estimate of accrued income taxes, which also may result from our income tax planning and from the resolution of income tax controversies, may be material to our operating results for any given period. Goodwill and Intangible Assets The nature of and accounting for goodwill and intangible assets are discussed in detail in Note 1 Summary of Significant Accounting Principles and Note 10 Goodwill and Intangible Assets to the Consolidated Financial Statements. Goodwill is reviewed for potential impairment at the reporting unit level on an annual basis which for the Corporation is performed as of June 30 or in interim periods if events or circumstances indicate a potential impairment. A reporting unit is a business segment or one level below. As reporting units are determined after an acquisition or evolve with changes in business strategy, goodwill is assigned and it no longer retains its association with a particular acquisition. All of the revenue streams and related activities of a reporting unit, whether acquired or organic, are available to support the value of the goodwill. The Corporation common stock price, consistent with common stock prices in the financial services industry, has been more volatile over the past 18 months primarily due to the deterioration in the financial markets in 2008 as the overall economy moved into a recession, followed in 2009 by stabilization and improvement in some sectors of the economy. During this period, our market capitalization remained below our recorded book value. The fair value of all reporting units as of the June 30, 2009 annual impairment test was estimated to be $262.8 billion and the common stock market capitalization of the Corporation as of that date was $114.2 billion ($149.6 billion at December 31, 2009, including CES). The implied control premium or the amount a buyer is willing to pay over the current market price of a publicly traded stock to obtain control, was 52 percent after taking into consideration the outstanding preferred stock of $58.7 billion as of June 30, 2009. As none of our reporting units are publicly traded, individual reporting unit fair value determinations are not directly correlated to the Corporation stock price. Although we believe it is reasonable to conclude that market capitalization could be an indicator of fair value over time, we do not believe that recent fluctuations in our market capitalization as a result of the market dislocation are reflective of actual cash flows and the fair value of our individual reporting units. Estimating the fair value of reporting units and the assets, liabilities and intangible assets of a reporting unit is a subjective process that involves the use of estimates and judgments, particularly related to cash flows, the appropriate discount rates and an applicable control premium. The fair values of the reporting units were determined using a combination of valuation techniques consistent with the market approach and the income approach and included the use of independent valuation specialists. Measurement of the fair values of the assets, liabilities and intangibles of a reporting unit was consistent with the requirements of the 90 Bank of America 2009 Table of Contents fair value measurements accounting guidance and includes the use of estimates and judgments. The fair values of the intangible assets were determined using the income approach. The market approach we used results in an estimate of the fair value of the individual reporting units by incorporating any combination of the tangible capital, book capital and earnings multiples from comparable publicly traded companies in similar industries to that of the reporting unit. The relative weight assigned to these multiples varies among the reporting units based upon qualitative and quantitative characteristics, primarily the size and relative profitability of the respective reporting unit as compared to the comparable publicly traded companies. Since the fair values determined under the market approach are representative of a noncontrolling interest, a control premium was added to arrive at the fair values of the reporting units on a controlling basis. For purposes of the income approach, discounted cash flows were calculated by taking the net present value of estimated cash flows using a combination of historical results, estimated future cash flows and an appropriate terminal value. Our discounted cash flow analysis employs a capital asset pricing model in estimating the discount rate (i.e., cost of equity financing) for each reporting unit. The inputs to this model include the risk-free rate of return; beta, a measure of the level of non-diversifiable risk associated with comparable companies for each specific reporting unit; market equity risk premium and in certain cases an unsystematic (company-specific) risk factor. The unsystematic risk factor is the input that specifically addresses uncertainty related to our projections of earnings and growth, including the uncertainty related to loss expectations. We utilized discount rates that we believe adequately reflect the risk and uncertainty in the financial markets generally and specifically in our internally developed forecasts. Expected rates of equity returns were estimated based on historical market returns and risk/return rates for similar industries to that of the reporting unit. We use our internal forecasts to estimate future cash flows and actual results may differ from forecasted results. We perform our annual goodwill impairment test for all reporting units as of June 30 each year. In performing the first step of the annual impairment analysis, we compared the fair value of each reporting unit to its current carrying amount, including goodwill. To determine fair value, we used a combination of a market approach and an income approach. Under the market approach, we compared earnings and equity multiples of the individual reporting units to multiples of public companies comparable to the individual reporting units. The control premiums used in the June 30, 2009 annual impairment test ranged from 25 percent to 35 percent. Under the income approach, we updated our assumptions to reflect the current market environment. The discount rates used in the June 30, 2009 annual impairment test ranged from 11 percent to 20 percent depending on the relative risk of a reporting unit. Growth rates developed by management for each reporting unit and/or individual revenue and expense items ranged from two percent to 10 percent. For certain revenue and expense items that have been significantly affected by the current economic environment, management developed separate long-term forecasts. Based on the results of step one of the impairment test, we determined that the carrying amount of the Home Loans & Insurance and Global Card Services reporting units, including goodwill, exceeded their fair value. The carrying amount of the reporting unit, fair value of the reporting unit and goodwill for Home Loans & Insurance were $16.5 billion, $14.3 billion and $4.8 billion, respectively, and for Global Card Services were $41.4 billion, $41.3 billion and $22.3 billion, respectively. Because the carrying amount exceeded the fair value, we performed step two of the goodwill impairment test for these reporting units as of June 30, 2009. For all other reporting units, step two was not required as their fair value exceeded their carrying amount in step one indicating there was no impairment. In step two, we compared the implied fair value of each reporting unit goodwill with the carrying amount of that goodwill. We determined the implied fair value of goodwill for a reporting unit by assigning the fair value of the reporting unit to all of the assets and liabilities of that unit, including any unrecognized intangible assets, as if the reporting unit had been acquired in a business combination. The excess of the fair value of the reporting unit over the amounts assigned to its assets and liabilities is the implied fair value of goodwill. Based on the results of step two of the impairment test as of June 30, 2009, we determined that goodwill was not impaired in the Home Loans & Insurance or Global Card Services reporting units. In estimating the fair value of the reporting units in step one of the goodwill impairment analysis, we note that the fair values can be sensitive to changes in the projected cash flows and assumptions. In some instances, minor changes in the assumptions could impact whether the fair value of a reporting unit is greater than its carrying amount. Furthermore, a prolonged decrease or increase in a particular assumption could eventually lead to the fair value of a reporting unit being less than its carrying amount. Also, to the extent step two of the goodwill analysis is required, changes in the estimated fair values of the individual assets and liabilities may impact other estimates of fair value for assets or liabilities and result in a different amount of implied goodwill, and ultimately the amount of goodwill impairment, if any. Given the results of our annual impairment test and due to continued stress on Home Loans & Insurance and Global Card Services as a result of current market conditions, we concluded that we should perform an additional impairment analysis for these two reporting units as of December 31, 2009. In step one of the goodwill impairment analysis, the fair value of Home Loans & Insurance was estimated with equal weighting assigned to the market approach and the income approach. The fair value of Global Card Services was estimated under the income approach. Under the market approach valuation for Home Loans & Insurance , significant assumptions were consistent with the assumptions used in our annual impairment tests as of June 30, 2009 and included market multiples and a control premium. In the Global Card Services valuation under the income approach, the significant assumptions included the discount rate, terminal value, expected loss rates and expected new account growth. Consistent with the June 30, 2009 annual impairment test, the carrying amount exceeded the fair value for Home Loans & Insurance requiring that we perform step two. Although Global Card Services passed step one of the goodwill impairment analysis, to further substantiate the value of the goodwill balance, we also performed the step two analysis for this reporting unit. The carrying amount of the reporting unit, fair value of the reporting unit and goodwill for Home Loans & Insurance were $27.3 billion, $20.3 billion and $4.8 billion, respectively, and for Global Card Services were $43.4 billion, $47.3 billion and $22.3 billion, respectively. The estimated fair value as a percent of the carrying amount at December 31, 2009 was 74 percent for Home Loans & Insurance and 109 percent for Global Card Services. The increase in the fair value of Global Card Services during the fourth quarter of 2009 was primarily attributable to improvement in market conditions and the economic outlook for the reporting unit. Under step two of the goodwill impairment analysis for both reporting units, significant assumptions in measuring the fair value of the assets and liabilities of the reporting units including discount rates, loss rates, interest rates and new account growth were updated in light of the improvement in economic conditions. Based on the results of step two of our impairment tests, there was no goodwill impairment as of December 31, 2009. If economic conditions deteriorate or other events adversely impact the business models and the related assumptions including discount Bank of America 2009 91 Table of Contents rates, loss rates, interest rates and new account growth used to value these reporting units, there could be a change in the valuation of our goodwill and intangible assets and may possibly result in the recognition of impairment losses. With any assumption change, when a prolonged change in performance causes the fair value of the reporting unit to fall below the carrying amount of goodwill, goodwill impairment will occur. Consolidation and Accounting for Variable Interest Entities Under applicable accounting guidance, a VIE is consolidated by the entity that will absorb a majority of the variability created by the assets of the VIE. The calculation of variability is based on an analysis of projected probability-weighted cash flows based on the design of the particular VIE. Scenarios in which expected cash flows are less than or greater than the expected outcomes create expected losses or expected residual returns. The entity that will absorb a majority of expected variability (the sum of the absolute values of the expected losses and expected residual returns) consolidates the VIE and is referred to as the primary beneficiary. A variety of qualitative and quantitative assumptions are used to estimate projected cash flows and the relative probability of each potential outcome, and to determine which parties will absorb expected losses and expected residual returns. Critical assumptions, which may include projected credit losses and interest rates, are independently verified against market observable data where possible. Where market observable data is not available, the results of the analysis become more subjective. As certain events occur, we reconsider which parties will absorb variability and whether we have become or are no longer the primary beneficiary. The consolidation status of a VIE may change as a result of such reconsideration events, which occur when VIEs acquire additional assets, issue new variable interests or enter into new or modified contractual arrangements. A reconsideration event may also occur when we acquire new or additional interests in a VIE. See the Impact of Adopting New Accounting Guidance on Consolidation section on page 52 for a discussion of new accounting that significantly changes the criteria for consolidation effective January 1, 2010. 2008 Compared to 2007 The following discussion and analysis provides a comparison of our results of operations for 2008 and 2007. This discussion should be read in conjunction with the Consolidated Financial Statements and related Notes. Tables 6 and 7 contain financial data to supplement this discussion. Overview Net Income Net income totaled $4.0 billion in 2008 compared to $15.0 billion in 2007. Including preferred stock dividends, income applicable to common shareholders was $2.6 billion, or $0.54 per diluted share. Those results compared with 2007 net income available to common shareholders of $14.8 billion, or $3.29 per diluted share. The return on average common shareholders equity was 1.80 percent in 2008 compared to 11.08 percent in 2007. Net Interest Income Net interest income on a FTE basis increased $10.4 billion to $46.6 billion for 2008 compared to 2007. The increase was driven by strong loan growth, as well as the acquisitions of Countrywide and LaSalle, and the contribution from market-based net interest income related to our Global Markets business, which benefited from the steepening of the yield curve and product mix. The net interest yield on a FTE basis increased 38 bps to 2.98 percent for 2008 compared to 2007, due to the improvement in market-based yield, the beneficial impact of the current interest rate environment and loan growth. Partially offsetting these increases were the additions of lower yielding assets from the Countrywide and LaSalle acquisitions. Noninterest Income Noninterest income decreased $5.0 billion to $27.4 billion in 2008 compared to 2007. Card income decreased $763 million primarily due to the negative impact of higher credit costs on securitized credit card loans and the related unfavorable change in value of the interest-only strip as well as decreases in interchange income and late fees. Partially offsetting these decreases was higher debit card income. Service charges grew $1.4 billion resulting from growth in new deposit accounts and the beneficial impact of the LaSalle acquisition. Investment and brokerage services decreased $175 million primarily due to the absence of fees related to the sale of a business that we sold in late 2007 and the impact of significantly lower valuations in the equity markets, partially offset by the full year impact of the U.S. Trust and LaSalle acquisitions. Investment banking income decreased $82 million due to reduced advisory fees related to the slowing economy. Equity investment income decreased $3.5 billion due to a reduction in gains from our Global Principal Investments portfolio attributable to the lack of liquidity in the marketplace when compared to 2007 and other-than-temporary impairments taken on certain AFS marketable equity securities. Trading account losses increased $1.0 billion in 2008 driven by losses related to CDO exposure and the continuing impact of the market disruptions on various parts of Global Markets . Mortgage banking income increased $3.2 billion in large part as a result of the Countrywide acquisition which contributed significantly to increases in servicing income of $1.7 billion and production income of $1.5 billion. Insurance premiums increased $1.1 billion primarily due to the Countrywide acquisition. Gains on sales of debt securities increased $944 million driven by the sales of MBS and CMOs. Other income decreased $2.9 billion due to Global Markets related write-downs and $1.1 billion associated with the support provided to certain cash funds managed within GWIM . In addition, 2008 was impacted by the absence of the $1.5 billion gain from the sale of a business in 2007. These items were partially offset by the gain of $776 million related to the Visa IPO. Net impairment losses recognized in earnings on AFS debt securities increased $3.1 billion primarily due to CDO related write-downs. Provision for Credit Losses The provision for credit losses increased $18.4 billion to $26.8 billion for 2008 compared to 2007 due to an increase of $9.8 billion in net charge-offs and higher additions to the reserve. The majority of the reserve additions were in consumer and small business portfolios, reflecting increased weakness in the housing markets and the slowing economy. Reserves were also increased on commercial portfolios for deterioration in the homebuilder and non homebuilder commercial portfolios within Global Banking . 92 Bank of America 2009 Table of Contents Noninterest Expense Noninterest expense increased $4.0 billion to $41.5 billion for 2008 compared to 2007, primarily due to the acquisitions of Countrywide and LaSalle, which increased various expense categories, partially offset by a reduction in performance-based incentive compensation expense and the impact of certain benefits associated with the Visa IPO transactions. Income Tax Expense Income tax expense was $420 million for 2008 compared to $5.9 billion for 2007 resulting in effective tax rates of 9.5 percent and 28.4 percent. The effective tax rate decrease was due to permanent tax preference amounts (e.g., tax exempt income and tax credits) offsetting a higher percentage of our pre-tax income. Business Segment Operations Deposits Net income increased $438 million, or nine percent, to $5.5 billion compared to 2007 driven by higher net interest income and noninterest income partially offset by an increase in noninterest expense. Net interest income increased $755 million, or seven percent, driven by a higher contribution from our ALM activities and growth in average deposits partially offset by the impact of competitive deposit pricing. Average deposits grew $33.3 billion, or 10 percent, due to organic growth, including customers flight-to-safety, as well as the acquisitions of Countrywide and LaSalle. Organic growth was partially offset by the migration of customer relationships and related deposit balances to GWIM . Noninterest income increased $683 million, or 11 percent, to $6.9 billion driven by an increase of $798 million, or 13 percent, in service charges primarily as a result of increased volume, new demand deposit account growth and the addition of LaSalle. Noninterest expense increased $433 million, or five percent, to $8.8 billion compared to 2007, primarily due to the LaSalle and Countrywide acquisitions, combined with an increase in accounts and transaction volumes. Global Card Services Net income decreased $3.0 billion, or 71 percent, to $1.2 billion compared to 2007 as growth in net interest income and noninterest income was more than offset by an $8.5 billion increase in provision for credit losses. Net interest income grew $3.0 billion, or 18 percent, to $19.6 billion driven by higher managed average loans of $22.3 billion, or 10 percent, combined with the beneficial impact of the decrease in short-term interest rates on our funding costs. Noninterest income increased $485 million, or four percent, to $11.6 billion as other income benefited from the $388 million gain related to Global Card Services allocation of the Visa IPO gain as well as a $283 million gain on the sale of a card portfolio. These increases were partially offset by the decrease in card income of $137 million, or one percent, due to the unfavorable change in the value of the interest-only strip and decreases in interchange income driven by reduced retail volume and late fees. These decreases were partially offset by higher debit card income due to new account and card growth, increased usage and the addition of LaSalle. Provision for credit losses increased $8.5 billion, or 73 percent, to $20.2 billion compared to 2007 primarily driven by portfolio deterioration and higher bankruptcies from impacts of the slowing economy, a lower level of foreign securitizations and growth-related seasoning of the portfolio. Noninterest expense decreased $217 million, or two percent, to $9.2 billion compared to 2007, as the impact of certain benefits associated with the Visa IPO transactions and lower marketing expense were partially offset by higher personnel and technology-related expenses from increased customer assistance and collections infrastructure. Home Loans & Insurance Home Loans & Insurance net income decreased $2.6 billion to a net loss of $2.5 billion compared to 2007 as growth in noninterest income and net interest income was more than offset by higher provision for credit losses and an increase in noninterest expense. Net interest income grew $1.4 billion, or 74 percent, driven primarily by an increase in average home equity loans and LHFS. The growth in average home equity loans of $32.9 billion, or 45 percent, and a $5.5 billion increase in LHFS were attributable to the Countrywide and LaSalle acquisitions as well as increases in our home equity portfolio as a result of slower prepayment speeds and organic growth. Noninterest income increased $4.2 billion to $6.0 billion compared to 2007 driven by increases in mortgage banking income and insurance income. Mortgage banking income grew $3.1 billion due primarily to the acquisition of Countrywide combined with increases in the value of MSR economic hedge instruments partially offset by a decrease in the value of MSRs. Insurance income increased $1.1 billion due to the acquisition of Countrywide. Provision for credit losses increased $5.3 billion to $6.3 billion compared to 2007. This increase was driven primarily by higher losses inherent in the home equity portfolio reflecting deterioration in the housing markets particularly in geographic areas that have experienced higher levels of declines in home prices. This drove more severe charge-offs as borrowers defaulted. Noninterest expense increased $4.4 billion to $7.0 billion primarily driven by the Countrywide acquisition. Global Banking Net income increased $341 million, or eight percent, to $4.5 billion in 2008 compared to 2007 as increased total revenue and lower noninterest expense were partially offset by an increase in provision for credit losses. Net interest income increased $2.1 billion, or 24 percent, driven by growth in average loans and leases of $64.1 billion, or 25 percent, and average deposits of $29.6 billion, or 20 percent. The increases in average loans and leases and average deposits were driven by the LaSalle acquisition and organic growth. Noninterest income decreased $42 million, or one percent, as Global Banking share of write-downs on legacy assets was partially offset by an increase in service charges and the $388 million gain related to Global Banking allocation of the Visa IPO gain. The increase in service charges was driven by organic growth, changes in our pricing structure and the LaSalle acquisition. The provision for credit losses increased $2.5 billion to $3.1 billion in 2008 compared to 2007. The increase was primarily driven by reserve additions and higher charge-offs primarily due to the continued weakness in the housing markets on the homebuilder portfolio. Also contributing to this increase were higher commercial domestic and foreign net charge-offs which increased from very low 2007 levels and higher net charge-offs and reserve increases in the retail dealer-related loan portfolios due to deterioration and seasoning of the portfolio. Noninterest expense decreased $874 million, or 12 percent, primarily due to lower incentive compensation and the impact of certain benefits associated with the Visa IPO transactions, partially offset by the addition of LaSalle. Global Markets Global Markets recognized a net loss of $4.9 billion in 2008 compared to a net loss of $3.8 billion in 2007 as increased net interest income and reduced noninterest expense were more than offset by increased sales and trading losses. Sales and trading revenue was a net loss of $6.9 billion in 2008 as compared to a net loss of $2.6 billion in 2007. These decreases were driven by losses related to CDO exposure, our hedging activities including counterparty credit risk valuations and the continuing impact of the market disruptions on various parts of our business including the severe volatility, illiquidity and credit dislocations that Bank of America 2009 93 Table of Contents were experienced in the debt and equity markets in the fourth quarter of 2008. Partially offsetting these declines were favorable results in our rates and currencies products which benefited from volatility in interest rates and foreign exchange markets which also drove favorable client flows. Noninterest expense declined $834 million primarily due to lower performance-based incentive compensation. Global Wealth & Investment Management Net income decreased $527 million, or 27 percent, to $1.4 billion in 2008 as increases in net interest income and investment and brokerage services income were more than offset by losses associated with the support provided to certain cash funds, increases in provision for credit losses and noninterest expense as well as losses related to the buyback of ARS. Net interest income increased $877 million, or 22 percent, to $4.8 billion due to higher margin on ALM activities, the acquisitions of U.S. Trust Corporation and LaSalle, and growth in average deposit and loan balances partially offset by spread compression driven by deposit mix and competitive deposit pricing. GWIM average deposit growth benefited from the migration of customer relationships and related balances from Deposits , organic growth and the U.S. Trust Corporation and LaSalle acquisitions. Noninterest income decreased $625 million, or 17 percent, to $3.0 billion driven by $1.1 billion in losses during 2008 related to the support provided to certain cash funds and losses of $181 million related to the buyback of ARS. These losses were partially offset by an increase of $278 million in investment and brokerage services resulting from the U.S. Trust Corporation acquisition partially offset by the impact of significantly lower valuations in the equity markets. Provision for credit losses increased $649 million to $664 million as a result of higher credit costs due to the deterioration in the housing markets and the impacts of a slower economy. Noninterest expense increased $419 million, or nine percent, to $4.9 billion due to the addition of U.S. Trust Corporation and LaSalle, and higher initiative spending partially offset by lower discretionary incentive compensation. All Other Net income decreased $4.5 billion to a net loss of $1.2 billion due to a decrease in total revenue combined with increases in provision for credit losses and merger and restructuring charges. Net interest income increased $113 million primarily due to increased net interest income related to our functional activities partially offset by the reclassification to card income related to our funds transfer pricing for Global Card Services securitizations. Noninterest income declined $3.3 billion to $820 million driven by decreases in equity investment income of $3.5 billion and all other income (loss) of $1.2 billion partially offset by increases in gains on sales of debt securities of $953 million and card income of $653 million. Excluding the securitization offset to present Global Card Services on a managed basis provision for credit losses increased $3.2 billion to $2.9 billion primarily due to higher credit costs related to our ALM, residential mortgage portfolio reflecting deterioration in the housing markets and the impacts of a slowing economy. Additionally, deterioration in our Countrywide discontinued real estate portfolio subsequent to the July 1, 2008 acquisition as well as the absence of 2007 reserve reductions also contributed to the increase in provision. Merger and restructuring charges increased $525 million to $935 million due to the integration costs associated with the Countrywide and LaSalle acquisitions. 94 Bank of America 2009 Table of Contents Statistical Tables Table I Year-to-date Average Balances and Interest Rates FTE Basis 2009 2008 2007 (Dollars in millions) Average Balance Interest Income/ Expense Yield/ Rate Average Balance Interest Income/ Expense Yield/ Rate Average Balance Interest Income/ Expense Yield/ Rate Earning assets Time deposits placed and other short-term investments $ 27,465 $ 713 2.60 % $ 10,696 $ 440 4.11 % $ 13,152 $ 627 4.77 % Federal funds sold and securities borrowed or purchased under agreements to resell 235,764 2,894 1.23 128,053 3,313 2.59 155,828 7,722 4.96 Trading account assets 217,048 8,236 3.79 186,579 9,259 4.96 187,287 9,747 5.20 Debt securities (1) 271,048 13,224 4.88 250,551 13,383 5.34 186,466 10,020 5.37 Loans and leases (2) : Residential mortgage (3) 249,335 13,535 5.43 260,244 14,657 5.63 264,650 15,112 5.71 Home equity 154,761 6,736 4.35 135,060 7,606 5.63 98,765 7,385 7.48 Discontinued real estate 17,340 1,082 6.24 10,898 858 7.87 n/a n/a n/a Credit card domestic 52,378 5,666 10.82 63,318 6,843 10.81 57,883 7,225 12.48 Credit card foreign 19,655 2,122 10.80 16,527 2,042 12.36 12,359 1,502 12.15 Direct/Indirect consumer (4) 99,993 6,016 6.02 82,516 6,934 8.40 70,009 6,002 8.57 Other consumer (5) 3,303 237 7.17 3,816 321 8.41 4,510 389 8.64 Total consumer 596,765 35,394 5.93 572,379 39,261 6.86 508,176 37,615 7.40 Commercial domestic 223,813 8,883 3.97 220,561 11,702 5.31 180,102 12,884 7.15 Commercial real estate (6) 73,349 2,372 3.23 63,208 3,057 4.84 42,950 3,145 7.32 Commercial lease financing 21,979 990 4.51 22,290 799 3.58 20,435 1,212 5.93 Commercial foreign 32,899 1,406 4.27 32,440 1,503 4.63 24,491 1,452 5.93 Total commercial 352,040 13,651 3.88 338,499 17,061 5.04 267,978 18,693 6.98 Total loans and leases 948,805 49,045 5.17 910,878 56,322 6.18 776,154 56,308 7.25 Other earning assets 130,063 5,105 3.92 75,972 4,161 5.48 71,305 4,629 6.49 Total earning assets (7) 1,830,193 79,217 4.33 1,562,729 86,878 5.56 1,390,192 89,053 6.41 Cash and cash equivalents 196,237 45,354 33,091 Other assets, less allowance for loan and lease losses 411,087 235,896 178,790 Total assets $ 2,437,517 $ 1,843,979 $ 1,602,073 Interest-bearing liabilities Domestic interest-bearing deposits: Savings $ 33,671 $ 215 0.64 % $ 32,204 $ 230 0.71 % $ 32,316 $ 188 0.58 % NOW and money market deposit accounts 358,847 1,557 0.43 267,818 3,781 1.41 220,207 4,361 1.98 Consumer CDs and IRAs 218,041 5,054 2.32 203,887 7,404 3.63 167,801 7,817 4.66 Negotiable CDs, public funds and other time deposits 37,661 473 1.26 32,264 1,076 3.33 20,557 974 4.74 Total domestic interest-bearing deposits 648,220 7,299 1.13 536,173 12,491 2.33 440,881 13,340 3.03 Foreign interest-bearing deposits: Banks located in foreign countries 19,397 144 0.74 37,657 1,063 2.82 42,788 2,174 5.08 Governments and official institutions 7,580 18 0.23 13,004 311 2.39 16,523 812 4.91 Time, savings and other 55,026 346 0.63 51,363 1,385 2.70 43,443 1,767 4.07 Total foreign interest-bearing deposits 82,003 508 0.62 102,024 2,759 2.70 102,754 4,753 4.63 Total interest-bearing deposits 730,223 7,807 1.07 638,197 15,250 2.39 543,635 18,093 3.33 Federal funds purchased, securities loaned or sold under agreements to repurchase and other short-term borrowings 488,644 5,512 1.13 455,710 12,362 2.71 424,814 21,967 5.17 Trading account liabilities 72,207 2,075 2.87 72,915 2,774 3.80 82,721 3,444 4.16 Long-term debt 446,634 15,413 3.45 231,235 9,938 4.30 169,855 9,359 5.51 Total interest-bearing liabilities (7) 1,737,708 30,807 1.77 1,398,057 40,324 2.88 1,221,025 52,863 4.33 Noninterest-bearing sources: Noninterest-bearing deposits 250,743 192,947 173,547 Other liabilities 204,421 88,144 70,839 Shareholders equity 244,645 164,831 136,662 Total liabilities and shareholders equity $ 2,437,517 $ 1,843,979 $ 1,602,073 Net interest spread 2.56 % 2.68 % 2.08 % Impact of noninterest-bearing sources 0.09 0.30 0.52 Net interest income/yield on earning assets $ 48,410 2.65 % $ 46,554 2.98 % $ 36,190 2.60 % (1) Yields on AFS debt securities are calculated based on fair value rather than the cost basis.

Bank of America 2009 107 Table of Contents Glossary Alt-A Mortgage Alternative-A mortgage, a type of U.S. mortgage that, for various reasons, is considered riskier than A-paper, or prime , and less risky than subprime, the riskiest category. Alt-A interest rates, which are determined by credit risk, therefore tend to be between those of prime and subprime home loans. Typically, Alt-A mortgages are characterized by borrowers with less than full documentation, lower credit scores and higher LTVs. Asset-Backed Commercial Paper Money Market Fund Liquidity Facility (AMLF) A lending program created by the Federal Reserve on September 19, 2008 that provides nonrecourse loans to U.S. financial institutions for the purchase of U.S. dollar-denominated high-quality asset-backed commercial paper from money market mutual funds under certain conditions. This program is intended to assist money market funds that hold such paper in meeting demands for redemptions by investors and to foster liquidity in the asset-backed commercial paper market and money markets more generally. Financial institutions generally bear no credit risk associated with commercial paper purchased under the AMLF. Assets in Custody Consist largely of custodial and non-discretionary trust assets excluding brokerage assets administered for customers. Trust assets encompass a broad range of asset types including real estate, private company ownership interest, personal property and investments. Assets Under Management (AUM) The total market value of assets under the investment advisory and discretion of GWIM which generate asset management fees based on a percentage of the assets market values. AUM reflect assets that are generally managed for institutional, high net-worth and retail clients and are distributed through various investment products including mutual funds, other commingled vehicles and separate accounts. At-the-market Offering A form of equity issuance where an exchange-listed company incrementally sells newly issued shares into the market through a designated broker/dealer at prevailing market prices, rather than via a traditional underwritten offering of a fixed number of shares at a fixed price all at once. Bridge Financing A loan or security that is expected to be replaced by permanent financing (debt or equity securities, loan syndication or asset sales) prior to the maturity date of the loan. Bridge loans may include an unfunded commitment, as well as funded amounts, and are generally expected to be retired in one year or less. CDO-squared A type of CDO where the underlying collateral includes tranches of other CDOs. Client Brokerage Assets Include client assets which are held in brokerage accounts. This includes non-discretionary brokerage and fee-based assets which generate brokerage income and asset management fee revenue. Client Deposits Includes GWIM client deposit accounts representing both consumer and commercial demand, regular savings, time, money market, sweep and foreign accounts. Committed Credit Exposure Includes any funded portion of a facility plus the unfunded portion of a facility on which the lender is legally bound to advance funds during a specified period under prescribed conditions. Core Net Interest Income Managed Basis Net interest income on a fully taxable-equivalent basis excluding the impact of market-based activities and certain securitizations. Credit Default Swap (CDS) A derivative contract that provides protection against the deterioration of credit quality and allows one party to receive payment in the event of default by a third party under a borrowing arrangement. Credit Card Accountability Responsibility and Disclosure Act of 2009 (CARD Act) Legislation signed into law on May 22, 2009 to provide changes to credit card industry practices including significantly restricting credit card issuers ability to change interest rates and assess fees to reflect individual consumer risk, change the way payments are applied and requiring changes to consumer credit card disclosures. The majority of the provisions became effective in February 2010. Derivative A contract or agreement whose value is derived from changes in an underlying index such as interest rates, foreign exchange rates or prices of securities. Derivatives utilized by the Corporation include swaps, financial futures and forward settlement contracts, and option contracts. Emergency Economic Stabilization Act of 2008 (EESA) Legislation signed into law on October 3, 2008 authorizing the U.S. Secretary of the Treasury to, among other things, establish the Troubled Asset Relief Program. Excess Servicing Income For certain assets that have been securitized, interest income, fee revenue and recoveries in excess of interest paid to the investors, gross credit losses and other trust expenses related to the securitized receivables are all classified as excess servicing income, which is a component of card income. Excess servicing income also includes the changes in fair value of the Corporation card related retained interests. Financial Stability Plan A plan announced on February 10, 2009 by the U.S. Treasury pursuant to the EESA which outlines a series of initiatives including the Capital Assistance Program (CAP); the creation of a new Public-Private Investment Program (PPIP); the expansion of the Term Asset-Backed Securities Loan Facility (TALF); the extension of the FDIC Temporary Liquidity Guarantee Program (TLGP) to October 31, 2009; the Small Business and Community Lending Initiative; a broad program to stabilize the housing market by encouraging lower mortgage rates and making it easier for homeowners to refinance and avoid foreclosure; and a new framework of governance and oversight related to the use of funds of the Financial Stability Plan. Interest-only Strip A residual interest in a securitization trust representing the right to receive future net cash flows from securitized assets after payments to third party investors and net credit losses. These arise when assets are transferred to a SPE as part of an asset securitization transaction qualifying for sale treatment under GAAP. Interest Rate Lock Commitment (IRLC) Commitment with a loan applicant in which the loan terms, including interest rate and price, are guaranteed for a designated period of time subject to credit approval. Loan-to-value (LTV) A commonly used credit quality metric that is reported in terms of ending and average LTV. Ending LTV is calculated as the outstanding carrying value of the loan at the end of the period divided by the estimated value of the property securing the loan. Estimated property values are primarily determined by utilizing the Case-Schiller Home Index, a widely used index based on data from repeat sales of single family homes. Case-Schiller indices are updated quarterly and are reported on a three-month or one-quarter lag. An additional metric related to LTV is combined loan-to-value (CLTV) which is similar to the LTV metric, yet combines the outstanding balance on the residential mortgage loan and the outstanding carrying value on the home equity loan or available line of credit, both of which are secured by the same property, divided by the estimated value of the property. A LTV of 100 percent reflects a loan that is currently secured by a property valued at an amount exactly equal to the carrying value or available line of the loan. Under certain circumstances, estimated values can also be determined by utilizing an automated valuation method (AVM) or Mortgage Risk Assessment Corporation (MRAC) index. An AVM is a tool that estimates the value of a prop - - 108 Bank of America 2009 Table of Contents erty by reference to large volumes of market data including sales of comparable properties and price trends specific to the MSA in which the property being valued is located. The MRAC index is similar to the Case-Schiller Home Index in that it is an index that is based on data from repeat sales of single family homes and is reported on a lag. Letter of Credit A document issued on behalf of a customer to a third party promising to pay the third party upon presentation of specified documents. A letter of credit effectively substitutes the issuer credit for that of the customer. Making Home Affordable Program (MHA) A U.S. Treasury program to reduce the number of foreclosures and make it easier for homeowners to refinance loans. The program is comprised of the Home Affordable Modification Program (HAMP) which provides guidelines on loan modifications and is designed to help at-risk homeowners avoid foreclosure by reducing monthly mortgage payments and provides incentives to lenders to modify all eligible loans that fall under the program guidelines and the Home Affordable Refinance Program (HARP) which is available to homeowners who have a proven payment history on an existing mortgage owned by FNMA or FHLMC and is designed to help eligible homeowners refinance their mortgage loans to take advantage of current lower mortgage rates or to refinance ARMs into more stable fixed-rate mortgages. In addition, the Second Lien Program is a part of the MHA. For more information on this program see the separate definition for the Second Lien Program. Managed Basis Managed basis assumes that securitized loans were not sold and presents earnings on these loans in a manner similar to the way loans that have not been sold (i.e., held loans) are presented. Noninterest income, both on a held and managed basis, also includes the impact of adjustments to the interest-only strip that are recorded in card income. Managed Net Losses Represent net charge-offs on held loans combined with realized credit losses associated with the securitized loan portfolio. Mortgage Servicing Right (MSR) The right to service a mortgage loan when the underlying loan is sold or securitized. Servicing includes collections for principal, interest and escrow payments from borrowers and accounting for and remitting principal and interest payments to investors. Net Interest Yield Net interest income divided by average total interest-earning assets. Nonperforming Loans and Leases Includes loans and leases that have been placed on nonaccrual status, including nonaccruing loans whose contractual terms have been restructured in a manner that grants a concession to a borrower experiencing financial difficulties (troubled debt restructurings or TDRs). Loans accounted for under the fair value option, purchased impaired loans and loans held-for-sale are not reported as nonperforming loans and leases. Past due consumer credit card loans, consumer loans secured by personal property, unsecured consumer loans, consumer loans secured by real estate where repayments are insured by the Federal Housing Administration and business card loans are not placed on nonaccrual status and are, therefore, not reported as nonperforming loans and leases. Option-adjusted Spread (OAS) The spread that is added to the discount rate so that the sum of the discounted cash flows equals the market price, thus, it is a measure of the extra yield over the reference discount factor (i.e., the forward swap curve) that a company is expected to earn by holding the asset. Primary Dealer Credit Facility (PDCF) A facility announced on March 16, 2008 by the Federal Reserve to provide discount window loans to primary dealers that settle on the same business day and mature on the following business day, in exchange for a specified range of eligible collateral. The rate paid on the loan is the same as the primary credit rate at the Federal Reserve Bank of New York. In addition, primary dealers are subject to a frequency-based fee after they exceed 45 days of use. The frequency-based fee is calculated on an escalating scale and communicated to the primary dealers in advance. The PDCF was available to primary dealers until February 1, 2010. Purchased Impaired Loan A loan purchased as an individual loan, in a portfolio of loans or in a business combination with evidence of deterioration in credit quality since origination for which it is probable, upon acquisition, that the investor will be unable to collect all contractually required payments. These loans are written down to fair value at the acquisition date. Qualifying Special Purpose Entity (QSPE) A SPE whose activities are strictly limited to holding and servicing financial assets and which meets the other criteria under applicable accounting guidance. A QSPE is generally not required to be consolidated by any party. Return on Average Common Shareholders Equity Measure of the earnings contribution as a percentage of average common shareholders equity. Second Lien Program (2MP) A MHA program announced on April 28, 2009 by the U.S. Treasury that focuses on creating a comprehensive affordability solution for homeowners. By focusing on shared efforts with lenders to reduce second mortgage payments, pay-for-success incentives for servicers, investors and borrowers, and a payment schedule for extinguishing second mortgages, the 2MP is designed to help up to 1.5 million homeowners. The program is designed to ensure that first and second lien holders are treated fairly and consistently with priority of liens, and offers automatic modification of a second lien when a first lien is modified. Details of the program are still being finalized as of the time of this filing. Securitize/Securitization A process by which financial assets are sold to a SPE, which then issues securities collateralized by those underlying assets, and the return on the securities issued is based on the principal and interest cash flow of the underlying assets. Structured Investment Vehicle (SIV) An entity that issues short duration debt and uses the proceeds from the issuance to purchase longer-term fixed income securities. Subprime Loans Although a standard industry definition for subprime loans (including subprime mortgage loans) does not exist, the Corporation defines subprime loans as specific product offerings for higher risk borrowers, including individuals with one or a combination of high credit risk factors, such as low FICO scores (generally less than 620 for secured products and 660 for unsecured products), high debt to income ratios and inferior payment history. Super Senior CDO Exposure Represents the most senior class of commercial paper or notes that are issued by CDO vehicles. These financial instruments benefit from the subordination of all other securities, including AAA-rated securities, issued by CDO vehicles. Treasury Temporary Guarantee Program for Money Market Funds (TTGP) A voluntary and temporary program announced on September 19, 2008 by the U.S. Treasury which provided for a guarantee to investors that they would receive $1.00 for each money market fund share held as of September 19, 2008 in the event that a participating fund no longer had a $1.00 per share net asset value and liquidated.
