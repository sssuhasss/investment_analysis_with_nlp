ITEM 7. MANAGEMENT S DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS OF FINANCIAL CONDITION AND RESULTS OF OPERATIONS General Information On October 29, 2008 (the Closing Date ), we completed our merger (the Merger ) with Northwest, creating the world largest airline. We now offer service to 378 worldwide destinations in 66 countries and expect to serve more than 170 million passengers each year. Combined with the reach of SkyTeam, our global airline alliance, and our codeshare partners, our customers can fly to 570 destinations in 111 countries. The Merger better positions us to manage through economic cycles and volatile oil prices, invest in our fleet, improve services for customers and achieve our strategic objectives. Year in Review For 2008, we reported a consolidated net loss of $8.9 billion, which reflects (1) a $7.3 billion non-cash charge from an impairment of goodwill and other intangible assets, (2) $1.1 billion in primarily non-cash Merger-related charges, (3) significantly increased fuel costs and (4) weakened demand due to the onset of a global recession. During 2008, fuel prices fluctuated dramatically. Fuel is one of our most significant costs. At the beginning of the year, crude oil prices hovered around $100 per barrel, escalating to $145 per barrel by mid-summer. We were not able to increase revenues through ticket prices, fuel surcharges or other passenger service fees to cover all of our higher fuel costs. Accordingly, we reduced capacity by 5% in the second half of the year compared to our 2008 plan. As part of this capacity reduction, we removed 31 aircraft from our operating fleet, of which 22 have been sold or returned to the lessors and nine remain temporarily grounded or held for sale. We also offered voluntary workforce reduction programs to our U.S. based non-pilot employees during the year. These programs helped us right-size our workforce to the capacity reductions. Approximately 4,200 employees, or 8% of our pre-Merger workforce, elected to participate in these programs. Throughout the summer months, fuel prices remained at record high levels and were forecasted to continue to rise. Based on this outlook, we added fuel hedges to protect against further escalating fuel costs. However, fuel prices fell dramatically during the third and fourth quarters, creating sizable losses on our fuel hedge contracts in the fourth quarter. Losses on our derivative contracts that relate to jet fuel purchases in 2009 are deferred on our Consolidated Balance Sheet for 2008 and will be recognized in 2009 when the hedged jet fuel is purchased and consumed. Northwest Merger We believe the Merger will generate approximately $2 billion in annual revenue and cost synergies by 2012 from more effective aircraft utilization, a more comprehensive and diversified route system and cost synergies from reduced overhead and improved operational efficiency. We expect to realize the following benefits from integrating the operations of Delta and Northwest: As a globally-balanced airline, we are better positioned to compete in the Open Skies environment by combining Delta strengths in the south, mountain west and northeast United States, Europe and Latin America with Northwest presence in the midwest and northwest United States and Asia; We expect the combined company to have the financial strength and flexibility to weather cyclical conditions in the airline industry; and Delta and Northwest complementary networks and common membership in the SkyTeam alliance are expected to ease the combination of operations that have complicated past mergers within the airline industry. 30 Table of Contents Index to Financial Statements In connection with the closing of the Merger, we awarded to substantially all U.S. based Delta and Northwest employees an aggregate of 101 million shares of common stock. This award recognizes the critical role of our employees in assisting us achieve our financial, operational and customer service goals. As a result of this award, we recorded $791 million in one-time primarily non-cash charges to restructuring and Merger-related items. We expect to incur one-time cash costs of approximately $500 million over approximately three years to integrate the two airlines. We plan to integrate the operations of Northwest into Delta as promptly as is feasible, which we anticipate we will substantially complete in 2010. Outlook We believe a combination of lower fuel prices, capacity reductions, and merger synergies better positions us to effectively manage our business through the current economic crisis. Nevertheless, we expect to report a significant loss in the March 2009 quarter primarily due to fuel hedge losses coupled with the impact of the global recession, which has weakened demand for air travel, and the first quarter traditionally being our weakest quarter due to seasonality. Fuel Prices and Other Costs In 2009, we expect to use approximately four billion gallons of jet fuel. At that level of consumption, a $1 change in the average annual per barrel price of crude oil can impact our financial results by approximately $100 million. Accordingly, the volatility of fuel prices will continue to have a major impact on our financial results. As discussed above, at current market prices we will recognize losses on hedge contracts that we entered into in 2008 when fuel prices were much higher. The majority of these losses will be recognized in the first half of 2009, as the hedged fuel is purchased and consumed. In January 2009, we have added new hedges that reflect current market prices, approximating 16% of our estimated 2009 consumption. Should fuel prices remain at their current levels, we will realize significant savings in fuel costs compared to 2008. We expect higher pension expense in 2009 compared to 2008 from a decline in the value of our defined benefit plan assets driven by market conditions and increases in certain other operating expenses in 2009 compared to 2008 due to timing delays between the reduction in capacity and our ability to remove certain capacity-related costs. We also expect to record approximately $260 million of higher interest expense related to increased amortization of debt discount, reflecting lower fair value of Northwest debt as of the Closing Date. Demand and Capacity The global economic recession has resulted in weaker demand for air travel. Our demand began to slow during the December 2008 quarter and we believe worsening global economic conditions in 2009 will substantially reduce U.S. airline industry revenues in 2009 compared to 2008. As a result, we have announced plans to further reduce capacity by 6-8% in 2009 compared to 2008 (which reflect planned reductions in domestic capacity of 8-10% and international capacity of 3-5%). If economic conditions continue to worsen, we expect to make additional reductions to our capacity. We believe we have flexibility in our network and fleet to remove additional capacity if the environment warrants. In December 2008, we announced additional voluntary workforce reduction programs for U.S. based non-pilot employees to align staffing with the planned capacity reductions. Approximately 2,100 employees elected to participate. We expect to record between $40 million and $50 million in restructuring charges during the March 2009 quarter for these programs. 31 Table of Contents Index to Financial Statements Merger Synergies As discussed above, we expect to generate significant synergies from the Merger. Our key early integration efforts will focus on (1) technology, (2) employees, (3) standardizing our fleet across the two airlines and (4) achieving a single operating certificate. We believe that we will recognize $500 million in synergy benefits in 2009, primarily in the second half of the year. Our ability to realize the synergies will depend, among other things, on our successfully aligning technologies of the two airlines, receiving a single operating certificate and resolving labor representation differences while maintaining productive employee relations. We have made significant progress regarding integration of our workgroups, including reaching joint collective bargaining agreements and integrated seniority lists with our pilots and flight dispatchers and reaching agreement on a seniority list with our meteorologists. Recently, the NMB accepted a request by the Aircraft Mechanics Fraternal Association ( AMFA ) to terminate AMFA certification to represent pre-merger NWA aircraft maintenance technicians and related employees, which will allow us to integrate these workgroups promptly. In addition, the Delta flight attendant seniority committee has reached a position on a combined seniority list that we believe is consistent with the position of the Association of Flight Attendants ( AFA ), which was certified to represent the NWA flight attendants prior to the merger. The integration of some portions of the rest of the Delta and NWA workforces may be challenging in part because representation and seniority integration issues must be resolved and two of the unions, the AFA and the International Association of Machinists and Aerospace Workers, which represents NWA airport employees and other categories of ground employees, have not said when they will seek to proceed to resolve those issues. Background and Combined Financial Results of the Predecessor and Successor In September 2005, we and substantially all of our subsidiaries (the Delta Debtors ) filed voluntary petitions for reorganization under Chapter 11 of the U.S. Bankruptcy Code (the Bankruptcy Code ). On April 30, 2007 (the Effective Date ), the Delta Debtors emerged from bankruptcy. References in this Form 10-K to Successor refer to Delta on or after May 1, 2007, after giving effect to (1) the cancellation of Delta common stock issued prior to the Effective Date; (2) the issuance of new Delta common stock and certain debt securities in accordance with the Delta Debtors Joint Plan of Reorganization ( Delta Plan of Reorganization ); and (3) the application of fresh start reporting. References to Predecessor refer to Delta prior to May 1, 2007. Upon emergence from Chapter 11, we adopted fresh start reporting in accordance with American Institute of Certified Public Accountants Statement of Position 90-7, Financial Reporting by Entities in Reorganization under the Bankruptcy Code ( SOP 90-7 ). The adoption of fresh start reporting resulted in our becoming a new entity for financial reporting purposes. Due to our adoption of fresh start reporting on April 30, 2007, the accompanying Consolidated Statements of Operations include the results of operations for (1) the year ended December 31, 2008 of the Successor, (2) the eight months ended December 31, 2007 of the Successor, (3) the four months ended April 30, 2007 of the Predecessor and (4) the year ended December 31, 2006 of the Predecessor. For purposes of management discussion and analysis of the results of operations in this Form 10-K, we combined the results of operations for the four months ended April 30, 2007 of the Predecessor with the eight months ended December 31, 2007 of the Successor. We then compare (1) Delta results of operations for the year ended December 31, 2008 with the 2007 combined results and (2) the 2007 combined results with the Predecessor results of operations for the year ended December 31, 2006. We also discuss significant fresh start reporting adjustments ( Fresh Start Adjustments ), which impacted comparability. We believe the 2007 combined results of operations provide management and investors with a more meaningful perspective on Delta financial and operational performance than if we did not combine the results of operations of the Predecessor and the Successor in this manner. Similarly, we combine the financial results of the Predecessor and the Successor when discussing our sources and uses of cash for the year ended December 31, 2007. 32 Table of Contents Index to Financial Statements Results of Operations 2008 Compared to 2007 Combined Operating Revenue (in millions) Year Ended December 31, 2008 Combined Increase Increase due to Northwest Operations October 30 to December 31, 2008 Increase (Decrease) Excluding Northwest Operations Year Ended December 31, 2007 Operating Revenue: Passenger: Mainline $ 15,137 $ 12,758 $ 2,379 $ 1,396 $ 983 Regional affiliates 4,446 4,170 276 334 (58 ) Total passenger revenue 19,583 16,928 2,655 1,730 925 Cargo 686 482 204 96 108 Other, net 2,428 1,744 684 199 485 Total operating revenue $ 22,697 $ 19,154 $ 3,543 $ 2,025 $ 1,518 Northwest Operations. As a result of the Merger, our results of operations for 2008 include Northwest operations for the period from October 30 to December 31, 2008, increasing our operating revenue $2.0 billion. The addition of Northwest to our operations for that period increased available seat miles ( ASMs ), or capacity, 10% for the full year. (in millions) Year Ended December 31, 2008 Increase (Decrease) Year Ended December 31, 2008 vs. 2007 Combined Passenger Mile Yield PRASM Load Factor Passenger Revenue: North America $ 8,707 4 % 6 % 2.1 pts Atlantic 4,390 9 % 7 % (1.2 )pts Latin America 1,362 13 % 16 % 2.1 pts Pacific 678 4 % 4 % 0.2 pts Total Mainline 15,137 6 % 7 % 1.0 pts Regional carriers 4,446 5 % 6 % 0.8 pts Total passenger revenue $ 19,583 5 % 6 % 1.0 pts Mainline Passenger Revenue. Mainline passenger revenue increased primarily due to (1) the inclusion of Northwest operations, (2) fare increases in response to increased fuel charges, (3) pricing and scheduling initiatives and (4) our increased service to international destinations. The increase in passenger revenue reflects a rise of 6% and 7% in passenger mile yield and passenger revenue per available seat mile ( PRASM ), respectively. North American Passenger Revenue . North American passenger revenue increased 8%, driven by a 2.1 point increase in load factor and a 6% increase in PRASM on a 1% increase in capacity. The passenger mile yield increased 4%. The increases in passenger revenue and PRASM reflect (1) the inclusion of Northwest operations and (2) fare increases, higher yields and our reduction of domestic flights in response to high fuel prices and the slowing economy. Excluding Northwest operations, we reduced domestic capacity by 7% for the year. International Passenger Revenue . International passenger revenue increased 38%, driven by a 27% increase in capacity due to growth in our international operations and the inclusion of Northwest operations, and a 9% increase in PRASM. The passenger mile yield increased 9%. These results reflect an increase in yields due to fuel surcharges and increases in service to international destinations, primarily in the Atlantic and Latin America markets, from the restructuring of our route network. Excluding Northwest operations, we increased international capacity by 14% for the year. 33 Table of Contents Index to Financial Statements Regional carriers . Passenger revenue of regional affiliates increased due to the inclusion of Northwest operations. Excluding Northwest operations, regional carriers revenue declined $58 million primarily due to an 8% decrease in capacity in response to high fuel prices and the slowing economy, as well as the termination of certain contract carrier agreements. Cargo . Cargo revenue increased due to the inclusion of Northwest operations and an increase in fuel surcharges, improved yields, and higher international volume. Other, net . Other, net revenue increased primarily due to the inclusion of Northwest operations. Excluding Northwest operations, other, net revenue increased $485 million primarily due to (1) new or increased administrative service charges and baggage handling fees, (2) growth in aircraft maintenance and staffing services to third parties and (3) higher SkyMiles program revenue.

As a result of the Merger, 2008 includes Northwest operations for the period from October 30 to December 31, 2008, increasing operating expense $2.1 billion. The addition of Northwest for that period increased capacity 10% for the full year. Restructuring and merger-related items. Restructuring and merger-related items totaled a $1.1 billion charge, primarily consisting of the following: Merger-related charges. $978 million in one-time primarily non-cash charges relating to the issuance or vesting of employee equity awards in connection with the Merger. Severance and related costs. $114 million in restructuring and related charges in connection with two voluntary workforce reduction programs for U.S. non-pilot employees announced in March 2008 in which approximately 4,200 employees elected to participate. Facilities and other. $25 million in facilities charges primarily related to accruals for future lease obligations for previously announced plans to close operations in Concourse C at the Cincinnati Northern Kentucky International Airport (the Cincinnati Airport ). Contract carrier restructuring. $14 million in charges associated with the early termination of certain capacity purchase agreements with contract carriers. Impairments. During the March 2008 quarter, we experienced a significant decline in market capitalization driven primarily by record fuel prices and overall airline industry conditions. In addition, the announcement of our intention to merge with Northwest established a stock exchange ratio based on the relative valuation of Delta and Northwest. As a result of these indicators, we determined goodwill was impaired and recorded a non-cash charge of $6.9 billion. In addition to the goodwill impairment charge, in the June 2008 quarter, we recorded a non-cash charge of $357 million to reduce the carrying value of certain intangible assets based on their revised estimated fair values. Fuel expense . Fuel expense, including contract carriers, increased $2.2 billion, primarily due to higher average fuel prices, partially offset by fuel hedge gains and reduced consumption from lower capacity. Fuel prices averaged $3.18 per gallon, including fuel hedge gains of $134 million, for 2008, compared to $2.24 per gallon, including fuel hedge gains of $51 million, for 2007. Salaries and related costs. A $109 million increase primarily from a 6% average increase in pilots and flight attendants to staff increased international flying, annual pay increases for all pilot and non-pilot non-management employees, and increases in group insurance rates, partially offset by a 3% average decrease in headcount primarily related to two voluntary workforce reduction programs. Aircraft maintenance materials and outside repairs. A $73 million increase primarily due to growth in our third party maintenance and repair business. Passenger service. A $67 million increase primarily associated with (1) the increased cost of catering on international flights, (2) product upgrades in our Business Elite cabins and (3) unfavorable foreign currency exchange rates. Profit sharing. A $158 million charge related to our broad-based employee profit sharing plan in 2007. We did not record any profit sharing expense in 2008. This plan provides that, for each year in which we have an annual pre-tax profit (as defined), we will pay at least 15% of that profit to eligible employees. Operating Income and Operating Margin We reported an operating loss of $8.3 billion for 2008 and operating income of $1.1 billion for 2007. Operating margin, which is the ratio of operating (loss) income to operating revenues, was (37)% and 6% for 2008 and 2007, respectively. 35 Table of Contents Index to Financial Statements Other (Expense) Income Other expense, net for 2008 was $727 million, compared to $492 million for 2007. This change is attributable to (1) a $53 million, or 8%, increase in interest expense primarily due to a higher level of debt outstanding, including Northwest debt for the period from October 30 to December 31, 2008 and the borrowing of the entire amount of our $1.0 billion revolving credit facility (the Revolving Facility ), partially offset by the repayment of our debtor-in-possession financing facilities (the DIP Facility ) and other higher floating rate debt in connection with our emergence from Chapter 11, (2) a $36 million decrease in interest income primarily from lower cash balances prior to the Merger and lower interest rates compared to 2007 and (3) a $146 million increase to miscellaneous, net due to the following: (in millions) Increase (Decrease) 2008 vs. 2007 Combined Miscellaneous, net Unfavorable foreign currency exchange rates $ 72 Impairments of our investments in The Reserve Primary Fund and insured auction rate securities 34 Mark-to-market adjustments on the ineffective portion of our fuel hedge contracts 21 Northwest non-operating expense from October 30 to December 31, 2008 12 Other 7 Total miscellaneous, net $ 146 Reorganization Items, Net Reorganization items, net totaled a $1.2 billion gain for 2007, primarily consisting of the following: Emergence gain. A net $2.1 billion gain due to our emergence from bankruptcy, comprised of (1) a $4.4 billion gain related to the discharge of liabilities subject to compromise in connection with the settlement of claims, (2) a $2.6 billion charge associated with the revaluation of our SkyMiles frequent flyer obligation and (3) a $238 million gain from the revaluation of our remaining assets and liabilities to fair value. Aircraft financing renegotiations and rejections . A $440 million charge for estimated claims primarily associated with the restructuring of the financing arrangements for 143 aircraft and adjustments to prior claims estimates. Contract carrier agreements . A net charge of $163 million in connection with amendments to certain contract carrier agreements. Emergence compensation . In accordance with Delta Plan of Reorganization, we made $130 million in lump-sum cash payments to approximately 39,000 eligible non-contract, non-management employees. We also recorded an additional charge of $32 million related to our portion of payroll related taxes associated with the issuance, as contemplated by Delta Plan of Reorganization, of approximately 14 million shares of common stock to those employees. Pilot collective bargaining agreement . An $83 million allowed general, unsecured claim in connection with the agreement between Comair, Inc., our wholly owned subsidiary ( Comair ), and the Air Line Pilots Association ( ALPA ) to reduce Comair pilot labor costs. 36 Table of Contents Index to Financial Statements Facility leases . A net $43 million gain, which primarily reflects (1) a $126 million net gain related to our settlement agreement with the Massachusetts Port Authority partially offset by (2) a net $80 million charge from an allowed general, unsecured claim in connection with the settlement relating to the restructuring of certain of our lease and other obligations at the Cincinnati Airport. Income Tax Benefit (Provision) We recorded an income tax benefit of $119 million for 2008 as a result of the impairment of our indefinite-lived intangible assets. The impairment of goodwill did not result in an income tax benefit as goodwill is not deductible for income tax purposes. We did not record an income tax benefit for the remainder of our loss for 2008, as it is fully reserved by a valuation allowance. For 2007, we recorded an income tax provision totaling $207 million. We have recorded a full valuation allowance against our net deferred tax assets, excluding the effect of the deferred tax liabilities that are unable to be used as a source of income against these deferred tax assets, based on our belief that it is more likely than not that the asset will not be realized in the future. We will continue to assess the need for a full valuation allowance in future periods. In accordance with SOP 90-7, any reduction in the valuation allowance as a result of the recognition of deferred tax assets is adjusted through goodwill, followed by other indefinite-lived intangible assets until the net carrying cost of these assets is zero. Accordingly, during 2007, we reduced goodwill by $211 million with respect to the realization of pre-emergence deferred tax assets. Results of Operations 2007 Combined Compared to 2006 Fresh Start Adjustments During the eight months ended December 31, 2007, Fresh Start Adjustments resulted in a $157 million increase to pre-tax income for the year ended December 31, 2007. The Fresh Start Adjustments consist of the following: (in millions) Increase (Decrease) to Pre-tax Income for 2007 Operating revenue $ 188 Operating expense Aircraft fuel expense and related taxes (46 ) Depreciation 127 Amortization (146 ) Aircraft maintenance materials and outside repairs (52 ) Other 19 Total operating expense (98 ) Operating income 90 Other income (primarily interest expense) 67 Income before income taxes $ 157 SkyMiles Frequent Flyer Program . We revalued our frequent flyer award liability to estimated fair value and changed our accounting policy from an incremental cost method to a deferred revenue method. Fair value represents the estimated price that third parties would require us to pay for them to assume the obligation of redeeming miles under the SkyMiles program. Fresh Start Adjustments for the SkyMiles program (including the change in accounting policy for that program) increased operating revenue by $188 million. 37 Table of Contents Index to Financial Statements Fuel Hedging . Prior to the adoption of fresh start reporting on April 30, 2007, we recorded as a component of stockholders deficit in other comprehensive loss $46 million of deferred gains related to our fuel hedging program. This gain would have been recognized as an offset to fuel expense as the underlying fuel hedge contracts were settled. However, as required by fresh start reporting, accumulated other comprehensive loss prior to emergence from Chapter 11 was reset to zero. Accordingly, Fresh Start Adjustments resulted in a non-cash increase to fuel expense of $46 million. Depreciation . We revalued property and equipment to fair value, which reduced the net book value of these assets by $1.0 billion. In addition, we adjusted the depreciable lives of flight equipment to reflect revised estimated useful lives. As a result, depreciation expense decreased by $127 million. Amortization of Intangible Assets . We valued our intangible assets at fair value, which increased the net book value of intangible assets (excluding goodwill) by $2.9 billion, of which $956 million relates to amortizable intangible assets. As a result, amortization expense increased by $146 million. Aircraft Maintenance Materials and Outside Repairs . We changed the way we account for certain maintenance parts that were previously capitalized and depreciated. After emergence, we expense these parts as they are placed on the aircraft. This change resulted in an increase in aircraft maintenance materials and outside repairs expense of $52 million. Interest Expense . The revaluation of our debt and capital lease obligations resulted in a decrease in interest expense due to the amortization of premiums from adjusting these obligations to fair value. During 2007, $33 million in future premium credits were accelerated in connection with accounting for (1) an amendment to certain financing arrangements and (2) the prepayment of certain secured debt. As a result, interest expense decreased by $70 million. Other Fresh Start Adjustments . We recorded other Fresh Start Adjustments relating primarily to the revaluation of our aircraft leases. These adjustments increased operating expense by $19 million and non-operating expense by $3 million. Accounting Adjustments During 2006, we recorded certain out-of-period adjustments ( Accounting Adjustments ) in our Consolidated Financial Statements that affect the comparability of our results for the years ended December 31, 2007 and 2006. These adjustments resulted in a net non-cash charge approximating $310 million to our Consolidated Statement of Operations for the year ended December 31, 2006, consisting of: A $112 million charge in landing fees and other rents. This adjustment is associated primarily with our airport facility leases at New York-JFK. It resulted from historical differences associated with recording escalating rent expense based on actual rent payments instead of on a straight-line basis over the lease term. A $108 million net charge related to the sale of mileage credits under our SkyMiles frequent flyer program. This includes an $83 million decrease in passenger revenue, a $106 million decrease in other, net revenue, and an $81 million decrease in other operating expense. This net charge primarily resulted from the reconsideration of our position with respect to the timing of recognizing revenue associated with the sale of mileage credits that we expect will never be redeemed for travel. A $90 million charge in salaries and related costs to adjust our accrual for postemployment healthcare benefits. This adjustment is due to healthcare payments applied to this accrual over several years, which should have been expensed as incurred. We believe the Accounting Adjustments, considered individually and in the aggregate, are not material to our Consolidated Financial Statements for the year ended December 31, 2006. In making this assessment, we 38 Table of Contents Index to Financial Statements considered qualitative and quantitative factors, including our substantial net loss in that year, the non-cash nature of the Accounting Adjustments, our substantial stockholders deficit at December 31, 2006, and our status as a debtor-in-possession under Chapter 11 of the Bankruptcy Code during that year. Operating Revenue Combined Predecessor Increase (Decrease) % Increase (Decrease) (in millions) Year Ended December 31, 2007 Year Ended December 31, 2006 Operating Revenue: Passenger: Mainline $ 12,758 $ 11,640 $ 1,118 10 % Regional affiliates 4,170 3,853 317 8 % Total passenger revenue 16,928 15,493 1,435 9 % Cargo 482 498 (16 ) (3 )% Other, net 1,744 1,541 203 13 % Total operating revenue $ 19,154 $ 17,532 $ 1,622 9 % Operating revenue totaled $19.2 billion for 2007, a $1.6 billion, or 9%, increase compared to 2006. Passenger revenue increased 9% on a 3% increase in ASMs, or capacity, and a 1.9 point increase in load factor. The increase in passenger revenue reflects a rise of 4% and 7% in passenger mile yield and PRASM, respectively. Mainline passenger revenue increased primarily due to (1) strong passenger demand, (2) our increased service to international destinations, (3) increased SkyMiles revenue associated with Fresh Start Adjustments discussed above and (4) the negative impact of Accounting Adjustments recorded in 2006 as discussed above. Passenger revenue of regional affiliates increased primarily due to increased flying by our contract carriers, which resulted in an 8% increase in revenue passenger miles ( RPMs ), or traffic, on 7% greater capacity. Other, net revenue increased primarily due to (1) increased SkyMiles revenue due to a change in accounting methodology and Fresh Start Adjustments discussed above, (2) increased administrative service charges and baggage handling fees, (3) growth in aircraft maintenance and staffing services to third parties and (4) the negative impact of Accounting Adjustments recorded in 2006 as discussed above. Combined Increase (Decrease) Year Ended December 31, 2007 Combined vs. 2006 (in millions) Year Ended December 31, 2007 Passenger Revenue RPMs ASMs Passenger Mile Yield PRASM Load Factor Passenger Revenue: North America $ 12,062 3 % % (3 )% 3 % 7 % 2.5pts International 4,745 28 % 17 % 16 % 9 % 11 % 1.0pts Charter 121 1 % 21 % 12 % (17 )% (9 )% 3.2pts Total passenger revenue $ 16,928 9 % 5 % 3 % 4 % 7 % 1.9 pts North American Passenger Revenue . North American passenger revenue increased 3%, driven by a 2.5 point increase in load factor and a 7% increase in PRASM on a 3% decline in capacity. The passenger mile yield increased 3%. The increases in passenger revenue and PRASM reflect (1) strong passenger demand and (2) revenue and network productivity improvements, including right-sizing capacity to better meet customer demand and the continued restructuring of our route network to reduce less productive short haul domestic flights and reallocate widebody aircraft to international routes. As a result of our efforts to right-size capacity in domestic markets, we increased flying by our contract carriers. 39 Table of Contents Index to Financial Statements International Passenger Revenue . International passenger revenue increased 28%, generated by a 17% increase in RPMs on a 16% increase in capacity and an 11% increase in PRASM. The passenger mile yield increased 9%. These results reflect increases in service to international destinations, primarily in the Atlantic and Latin America markets, from the restructuring of our route network. Our mix of domestic versus international capacity was 67% and 33%, respectively, for 2007, compared to 71% and 29%, respectively, for 2006. Operating Expense Combined Predecessor Increase (Decrease) % Increase (Decrease) (in millions) Year Ended December 31, 2007 Year Ended December 31, 2006 Operating Expense: Aircraft fuel and related taxes $ 4,686 $ 4,433 $ 253 6 % Salaries and related costs 4,189 4,365 (176 ) (4 )% Contract carrier arrangements 3,152 2,656 496 19 % Depreciation and amortization 1,164 1,276 (112 ) (9 )% Contracted services 996 918 78 8 % Aircraft maintenance materials and outside repairs 983 921 62 7 % Passenger commissions and other selling expenses 933 888 45 5 % Landing fees and other rents 725 881 (156 ) (18 )% Passenger service 338 332 6 2 % Aircraft rent 246 316 (70 ) (22 )% Profit sharing 158 158 NM Restructuring, asset writedowns, pension settlements and related items, net 13 (13 ) (100 )% Other 488 475 13 3 % Total operating expense $ 18,058 $ 17,474 $ 584 3 % Operating expense was $18.1 billion for 2007, a $584 million, or 3%, increase compared to 2006. Operating capacity increased 3% to 151.8 billion ASMs due mainly to increases in service to international destinations, primarily in the Atlantic and Latin America markets, from the restructuring of our route network and higher contract carrier flying from our initiatives to right-size capacity. Cost per available seat mile ( CASM ) increased 1% to 11.90 . Aircraft fuel and related taxes . Aircraft fuel and related taxes increased primarily due to higher average fuel prices and increased Mainline consumption. These increases were partially offset by gains on our fuel hedging derivatives. Fuel prices averaged $2.21 per gallon, including fuel hedge gains of $51 million, for 2007, compared to $2.10 per gallon, including fuel hedge losses of $108 million, for 2006. Salaries and related costs . The decrease in salaries and related costs reflects a decline of (1) $382 million due to benefit cost reductions for our pilot and non-pilot employees and (2) $90 million due to a charge during 2006 associated with Accounting Adjustments discussed above. These decreases were partially offset by (1) expense associated with share-based compensation resulting from equity awards granted upon emergence from bankruptcy and (2) an 8% increase in Mainline headcount due to our expansion at New York-JFK and our assumption of Atlantic Southeast Airlines, Inc. ( ASA ) ramp operations in Atlanta. Contract carrier arrangements . Contract carrier arrangements expense increased due to a 16% growth in contract carrier flying from our business plan initiatives to right-size capacity in domestic markets and due to higher average fuel prices. Fuel prices for our contract carriers averaged $2.37 per gallon for 2007, compared to $2.22 per gallon for 2006. 40 Table of Contents Index to Financial Statements Depreciation and amortization. Depreciation expense decreased primarily due to (1) a lower depreciable asset base resulting from $127 million in Fresh Start Adjustments discussed above and (2) 2006 adjustments to accelerate depreciation on certain limited life parts and aircraft. These decreases were partially offset by amortization expense of $146 million related to intangibles created in connection with the Fresh Start Adjustments discussed above. Contracted services . The increase in contracted services is primarily due to (1) higher outsourcing related to information technology, cargo handling services and our aircraft cleaning services, (2) international expansion and (3) New York-JFK facility improvements. Landing fees and other rents. Landing fees and other rents decreased primarily due to a charge recorded in 2006 associated with Accounting Adjustments discussed above and due to benefits of restructuring certain contracts and lease obligations in bankruptcy. Aircraft Rent. The decline in aircraft rent expense is primarily due to the renegotiation and rejection of certain leases in connection with our restructuring under Chapter 11 and Fresh Start Adjustments discussed above. Profit sharing . Our broad-based employee profit sharing plan provides that, for each year in which we have an annual pre-tax profit (as defined), we will pay at least 15% of that profit to eligible employees. Based on our pre-tax earnings, we accrued $158 million under the profit sharing plan for 2007. Operating Income and Operating Margin We reported operating income of $1.1 billion and $58 million for 2007 and 2006, respectively. Operating margin, which is the ratio of operating income to operating revenues, was 6% and less than 1% for 2007 and 2006, respectively. Other (Expense) Income Other expense, net for 2007 was $492 million, compared to $820 million for 2006. This change is substantially attributable to (1) a 25%, or $218 million, net decrease in interest expense primarily due to the repayment of the DIP Facility in connection with our emergence from Chapter 11 and Fresh Start Adjustments discussed above, partially offset by interest expense on borrowings under a senior secured exit financing facility, which we entered into in conjunction with our emergence from bankruptcy (the Exit Facilities ), (2) a $59 million increase in interest income primarily from interest earned due to bankruptcy initiatives that was classified within reorganization items, net, in 2006 and (3) a $51 million increase to miscellaneous, net, primarily related to fuel hedge losses in 2006 and foreign currency gains in 2007 due to an increased number of transactions denominated in foreign currencies. Reorganization Items, Net Reorganization items, net totaled a $1.2 billion gain for 2007. For additional information about these items, see Results of Operations 2008 Compared to 2007 Combined. Reorganization items, net totaled a $6.2 billion charge for 2006, primarily consisting of the following: Pilot pension termination . $2.2 billion and $801 million allowed general, unsecured claims in connection with our settlement agreements with the Pension Benefit Guaranty Corporation ( the PBGC ) and a group representing retired pilots, respectively. Charges for these claims were offset by $1.3 billion in settlement gains associated with the derecognition of the previously recorded obligations for the qualified defined benefit pension plan for Delta pilots (the Delta Pilot Plan ) and the related pilot non-qualified plans upon the termination of these plans. 41 Table of Contents Index to Financial Statements Pilot collective bargaining agreement . A $2.1 billion allowed general, unsecured claim in connection with our comprehensive agreement with ALPA reducing our pilot labor costs. Aircraft financing renegotiations and rejections . A $1.7 billion charge for estimated claims associated with restructuring the financing arrangements for 188 aircraft and the rejection of 16 aircraft leases. Retiree healthcare benefit claims . A $539 million charge for allowed general, unsecured claims in connection with agreements that we reached with committees representing both pilot and non-pilot retired employees reducing their postretirement healthcare benefits. Income Tax (Provision) Benefit For 2007, we recorded an income tax provision totaling $207 million. For additional information about this provision, see Results of Operations 2008 Compared to 2007 Combined. For 2006, we recorded an income tax benefit totaling $765 million. The amount primarily reflects a decrease to our deferred tax asset valuation allowances from the reversal of accrued pension liabilities associated with the Delta Pilot Plan and pilot non-qualified plan obligations upon each plan termination. Financial Condition and Liquidity Our cash and cash equivalents and short-term investments were $4.5 billion at December 31, 2008 compared to $2.8 billion at December 31, 2007. This increase primarily reflects our Merger with Northwest, in which we acquired $2.4 billion of cash and cash equivalents, $1.0 billion we received from American Express for an advance purchase of SkyMiles and the borrowing of $1.0 billion under the Revolving Facility that is a part of our senior secured exit financing facilities (the Exit Facilities ), partially offset by $1.2 billion of fuel hedge margin that we were required to post with counterparties. The counterparties under our fuel hedge contracts have the right to require us to secure our obligations under those contracts by posting the margin associated with any loss position on those contracts. Our contracts related to the margin balance as of the end of 2008 generally settle during the first half of 2009. If fuel prices continue to fall, we may be required to post additional collateral under those contracts. We expect to meet our cash needs for 2009 from cash flows from operations, cash and cash equivalents, short-term investments and financing arrangements. We have an undrawn $500 million revolving credit facility. With respect to our aircraft order commitments at December 31, 2008, we have financing commitments from third parties, cancellation rights or definitive agreements to sell certain aircraft to third parties immediately following delivery of those aircraft to us by the manufacturer. While we do not currently anticipate a need to access the capital markets to meet our cash needs in 2009, the continued credit crisis and related turmoil in the global financial system may restrict our ability to access the markets at a time when we would like, or need, to do so. These conditions could have an impact on our flexibility to react to changing economic and business conditions. In addition, our ability to obtain additional financing on acceptable terms for future needs could be affected by the fact that substantially all of our assets are subject to liens. The financing agreements of Delta and its subsidiaries contain certain affirmative, negative and financial covenants. We were in compliance with all covenants as of December 31, 2008. 42 Table of Contents Index to Financial Statements Significant Liquidity Events Significant liquidity events during 2008 were as follows: American Express Agreement. In December 2008, we entered into a multi-year extension of our exclusive Co-brand Credit Card relationship with American Express (the American Express Agreement ). As part of the American Express Agreement, we received $1.0 billion from American Express for an advance purchase of SkyMiles. We also expect to receive an additional $1.0 billion benefit from contract improvements through 2010. Exit financing facility. In August 2008, we borrowed the entire amount of our $1.0 billion Revolving Facility under the Exit Facilities to increase our financial flexibility. Hedge Margin. In accordance with our fuel and interest rate hedge contracts, we were required to post $1.1 billion of margin with counterparties. Northwest financing facility . In October 2008, Northwest entered into a $500 million revolving credit facility (the Revolving Credit Facility ), which matures at the earlier of (1) October 2009 (with respect to $300 million of such facility) or October 2011 (with respect to $200 million of such facility) or (2) the date that Northwest Airlines, Inc., is no longer a separate legal entity and an operating airline, including when it is merged with and into Delta Air Lines, Inc. As of December 31, 2008, there were no outstanding borrowings under the facility. For additional information regarding these matters, see Notes 4 and 6 of the Notes to the Consolidated Financial Statements. Combined Sources and Uses of Cash Cash flows from operating activities Cash used in operating activities totaled $1.7 billion for 2008, and cash provided by operating activities was $1.4 billion for 2007. Cash used in operating activities for 2008 reflects (1) an increase in aircraft fuel payments due to record high fuel prices for most of the year, (2) the posting of $1.1 billion in margin with counterparties primarily from our estimated fair value loss position on our fuel hedge contracts at December 31, 2008, (3) the payment of $438 million in premiums for fuel hedge derivatives entered into during 2008, (4) a $444 million decrease in advance ticket sales due to the slowing economy and (5) the payment of $158 million in 2008 under our broad-based employee profit sharing plan related to 2007. Cash used in operating activities was partially offset by cash flows driven by a $3.5 billion increase in operating revenue, $2.0 billion of which is directly attributable to Northwest operations since the Closing Date. Cash flows from operating activities in 2007 reflect $875 million in cash used under Delta Plan of Reorganization to satisfy bankruptcy-related obligations under our comprehensive agreement with ALPA and settlement agreement with the PBGC. Cash flows from operating activities during 2007 also reflect (1) the release of $804 million from restricted cash pursuant to an amendment to our Visa/Mastercard credit card processing agreement, (2) revenue and network productivity improvements, including right-sizing capacity to better meet customer demand and the continued restructuring of our route network to reduce less productive short haul domestic flights and reallocate widebody aircraft to international routes and (3) a $476 million decrease in short-term investments primarily from sales of auction rate securities. Cash flows from investing activities Cash provided by investing activities totaled $1.6 billion for 2008, and cash used in investing activities was $625 million for 2007. Cash provided by investing activities in 2008 reflects (1) the inclusion of $2.4 billion in cash and cash equivalents from Northwest in the Merger and (2) $609 million in restricted cash and cash 43 Table of Contents Index to Financial Statements equivalents, primarily related to $500 million of cash from a Northwest borrowing that was released from escrow. These inflows were partially offset by investments of $1.3 billion for flight equipment and $241 million for ground property and equipment. Cash used in investing activities in 2007 reflects investments of $810 million for flight equipment and advanced payments for aircraft commitments and $226 million for ground property and equipment. During 2007, restricted cash decreased by $185 million. In addition, we received $34 million and $83 million from the sale of our investments in priceline.com Incorporated and ARINC Incorporated, respectively. Cash flows from financing activities Cash provided by financing activities totaled $1.7 billion for 2008, and cash used in financing activities was $120 million in 2007. Cash provided by financing activities in 2008 primarily reflects (1) $1.0 billion in borrowings under the Revolving Facility, (2) $1.0 billion received under the American Express Agreement for an advance purchase of SkyMiles, and (3) $1.0 billion from aircraft financing. Cash provided by financing activities was partially offset by the repayment of $1.6 billion of long-term debt and capital lease obligations. Cash used in financing activities in 2007 primarily reflects (1) the repayment of the DIP Facility with a portion of the proceeds available under the Exit Facilities and existing cash, (2) the prepayment of $863 million of secured debt with a portion of the proceeds from the sale of enhanced equipment trust certificates and (3) scheduled principal payments on long-term debt and capital lease obligations. During 2007, we also received $181 million in proceeds from an amendment to certain financing arrangements in which the outstanding principal amount was increased to $415 million and the interest rate we pay under this facility was reduced. Contractual Obligations The following table summarizes our contractual obligations as of December 31, 2008 that relate to debt, operating leases, aircraft order commitments, capital leases, contract carrier obligations, other material, noncancelable purchase obligations and other commitments. The table does not include commitments that are contingent on events or other factors that are uncertain or unknown at this time, some of which are discussed in footnotes to this table and in the text immediately following the footnotes. Contractual Obligations by Year (in millions) 2009 2010 2011 2012 2013 After 2013 Total Long-term debt (1) $ 1,984 $ 3,333 $ 2,884 $ 3,700 $ 1,321 $ 7,644 $ 20,866 Contract carrier obligations (2) 2,130 2,130 2,170 2,130 2,060 9,610 20,230 Operating lease payments (3) 1,646 1,559 1,326 1,204 1,059 5,664 12,458 Aircraft order commitments (4) 1,520 990 60 110 90 130 2,900 Capital lease obligations (5) 135 134 129 98 64 264 824 Other purchase obligations (6) 267 82 64 58 39 82 592 Other commitments (7) 40 40 40 40 20 180 Total (8) $ 7,722 $ 8,268 $ 6,673 $ 7,340 $ 4,653 $ 23,394 $ 58,050 (1) Interest payments, excluding the impact of our interest rate hedges, related to long-term debt are included in the table. The principal portion of these obligations is included in our Consolidated Balance Sheets. Estimated amounts for future interest and related payments in connection with our long-term debt obligations are based on the fixed and variable interest rates specified in the associated debt agreements. Estimates on variable rate interest were calculated using implied short-term LIBOR based on LIBOR at December 31, 2008. Also included in the table are other debt-related payments, which represent credit enhancements required in conjunction with certain financing agreements. (2) This amount represents our minimum fixed obligations under our contract carrier agreements with ASA, Chautauqua Airlines, Inc. ( Chautauqua ), Freedom Airlines, Inc. ( Freedom ), Pinnacle Airlines, Inc. ( Pinnacle ), Shuttle America Corporation ( Shuttle America ) and SkyWest Airlines, Inc. ( SkyWest Airlines ) (excluding contract carrier aircraft lease payments accounted for as operating leases). 44 Table of Contents Index to Financial Statements (3) This amount includes our noncancelable operating leases and our lease payments related to aircraft under our contract carrier agreements with ASA, Chautauqua, Freedom, Pinnacle, Shuttle America and SkyWest Airlines. (4) We have excluded from the table our order of 18 B-787-8 aircraft. The Boeing Company ( Boeing ) has informed us that Boeing will be unable to meet the contractual delivery schedule for these aircraft. We are in discussions with Boeing regarding this situation. Our firm orders to purchase 33 B-737-800 aircraft include 31 B-737-800 aircraft, which we have entered into definitive agreements to sell to two third parties immediately following delivery of these aircraft to us by the manufacturer. We have not received any notice that these parties have defaulted on their purchase obligations. These sales will reduce our future commitments by approximately $1.3 billion during the period from 2009 through 2011 ($490 million, $730 million and $40 million for 2009, 2010 and 2011, respectively). (5) Interest payments related to capital lease obligations are included in the table. The present value of these obligations, excluding interest, is included on our Consolidated Balance Sheets. (6) Includes purchase obligations pursuant to which we are required to make minimum payments for goods and services, including but not limited to insurance, outsourced human resource services, marketing, maintenance, technology, sponsorships and other third party services and products. (7) Represents commitments to certain vendors for which we are obligated to generate specified amounts of revenue related to ticket booking fees. (8) In addition to the contractual obligations included in the table, we have significant cash obligations that are not included in the table. For example, we will pay wages required under collective bargaining agreements, fund pension plans (as discussed below) purchase capacity under contract carrier arrangements (as discussed below), settle tax contingency reserves (as discussed below) and pay credit card processing fees and fees for other goods and services, including those related to fuel, maintenance and commissions. While we are parties to legally binding contracts regarding these goods and services, the actual commitment is contingent on certain factors such as volume and/or variable rates that are uncertain or unknown at this time. Therefore, these items are not included in the table. In addition, purchase orders made in the ordinary course of business are excluded from the table and any amounts which we are liable for under the purchase orders are included in current liabilities on our Consolidated Balance Sheets. Payments under our profit-sharing plan or pursuant to our 2007 Performance Compensation Plan are contingent on factors unknown at this time and, therefore, are not included in this table. The following items are not included in the table above: Pension Plans. We sponsor qualified defined contribution ( DC Plans ) and defined benefit pension plans ( DB Plans ) for eligible employees and retirees. Our funding obligations for these plans are governed by ERISA. Estimates of pension plan funding requirements can vary materially from actual funding requirements because the estimates are based on various assumptions, including those described below. DC Plans. During 2008, we contributed approximately $215 million to our DC Plans or directly to employees that otherwise would have been contributed to the DC Plans on their behalf, but for limits imposed by the Internal Revenue Code. In 2009, we expect to contribute approximately $300 million related to our DC Plans. DB Plans. During 2008, we contributed approximately $115 million to our DB Plans, which include a defined benefit pension plan for eligible non-pilot Delta employees and retirees (the Delta Non-Pilot Plan ) and defined benefit pension plans for eligible Northwest employees and retirees (the Northwest Pension Plans ). These plans have been frozen for future benefit accruals. The Pension Protection Act of 2006 allows commercial airlines to elect alternative funding rules ( Alternative Funding Rules ) for defined benefit plans that are frozen. Under the Alternative Funding Rules, the unfunded liability for a frozen defined benefit plan may be funded over a fixed 17-year period and is calculated using an 8.85% interest rate. Delta elected the Alternative Funding Rules for the Delta Non-Pilot Plan, effective April 1, 2007; and Northwest elected the Alternative Funding Rules for the Northwest Pension Plans, effective October 1, 2006. The Alternative Funding Rules allow us to reduce the funding obligations for the Delta Non-Pilot Plan and the Northwest Pension Plans over the next several years compared to what our funding obligations would be under rules applicable to other DB plans. While the Alternative Funding Rules also make our funding obligations for these plans more predictable, our estimates of future funding requirements of the Delta Non-Pilot Plan and 45 Table of Contents Index to Financial Statements Northwest Pension Plans are based on various assumptions concerning factors outside our control, including, among other things, the market performance of assets; statutory requirements; and demographic data for participants, including the number of participants and the rate of participant attrition. Results that vary significantly from our assumptions could have a material impact on our future funding obligations. We estimate that the funding requirements for the Delta Non-Pilot Plan and the Northwest Pension Plans will total approximately $275 million in 2009. Due primarily to the recent decline in the investment markets, we expect our contributions to these plans to significantly increase for 2010 and thereafter. Contract Carrier Agreements . During the year ended December 31, 2008, seven regional air carriers ( Contract Carriers ) operated for us (in addition to our wholly-owned subsidiaries, Comair, Inc. ( Comair ), Compass Airlines, Inc. ( Compass ) and Mesaba Aviation, Inc. ( Mesaba )) pursuant to capacity purchase agreements. Under these agreements, the regional air carriers operate some or all of their aircraft using our flight designator codes, and we control the scheduling, pricing, reservations, ticketing and seat inventories of those aircraft and retain the revenues associated with those flights. We pay those airlines an amount, as defined in the applicable agreement, which is based on a determination of their cost of operating those flights and other factors intended to approximate market rates for those services. The above table shows our minimum fixed obligations under these capacity purchase agreements (excluding Comair, Compass and Mesaba). The obligations set forth in the table contemplate minimum levels of flying by the Contract Carriers under the respective agreements and also reflect assumptions regarding certain costs associated with the minimum levels of flying such as for fuel, labor, maintenance, insurance, catering, property tax and landing fees. Accordingly, our actual payments under these agreements could differ materially from the minimum fixed obligations set forth in the table above. For information regarding payments we may be required to make in connection with certain terminations of our capacity purchase agreements with Chautauqua and Shuttle America, see Contingencies Related to Termination of Contract Carrier Agreements in Note 8 of the Notes to the Consolidated Financial Statements. FIN 48. We adopted FASB Interpretation No. 48, Accounting for Uncertainty in Income Taxes an interpretation of FASB Statement No. 109, on January 1, 2007. The total amount of unrecognized tax benefits on the Consolidated Balance Sheet at December 31, 2008 is $29 million. We have accrued $5 million for the payment of interest and $8 million for the payment of penalties related to these unrecognized tax benefits. We are currently under audit by the Internal Revenue Service for the 2005 through 2007 tax years. The audit is substantially complete and is expected to close in early 2009. Legal Contingencies . We are involved in various legal proceedings relating to employment practices, environmental issues and other matters concerning our business. We cannot reasonably estimate the potential loss for certain legal proceedings because, for example, the litigation is in its early stages or the plaintiff does not specify the damages being sought. Other Contingent Obligations under Contracts . In addition to the contractual obligations discussed above, we have certain contracts for goods and services that require us to pay a penalty, acquire inventory specific to us or purchase contract specific equipment, as defined by each respective contract, if we terminate the contract without cause prior to its expiration date. Because these obligations are contingent on our termination of the contract without cause prior to its expiration date, no obligation would exist unless such a termination occurs. For additional information about other contingencies not discussed above, as well as information related to general indemnifications, see Note 8 of the Notes to the Consolidated Financial Statements. 46 Table of Contents Index to Financial Statements Application of Critical Accounting Policies Critical Accounting Estimates The preparation of financial statements in conformity with accounting principles generally accepted in the United States of America requires management to make certain estimates and assumptions. We periodically evaluate these estimates and assumptions, which are based on historical experience, changes in the business environment and other factors that management believes to be reasonable under the circumstances. Actual results may differ materially from these estimates. Frequent Flyer Programs. We have a frequent flyer program (the SkyMiles Program ) offering incentives to increase travel on Delta. This program allows participants to earn mileage credits by flying on Delta, Contract Carriers and participating airlines, as well as through participating companies such as credit card companies, hotels and car rental agencies. We also sell mileage credits to other airlines and to non-airline businesses. Mileage credits can be redeemed for free or upgraded air travel on Delta and participating airlines, for membership in our Crown Room Club and for other program awards. In the Merger, we assumed Northwest frequent flyer program (the WorldPerks Program ). We are consolidating the SkyMiles and WorldPerks Programs, which will ultimately provide for the combining of miles from each program at a one-to-one ratio. The WorldPerks Program is accounted for under the same methodology as the SkyMiles Program. We use the residual method for revenue recognition of mileage credits. The fair value of the mileage credit component is determined based on prices at which we sell mileage credits to other airlines, currently $0.0054 per mile and is re-evaluated at least annually. Under the residual method, the portion of the revenue from the sale of mileage credits that approximates fair value is deferred and recognized as passenger revenue when miles are redeemed and services are provided based on the weighted- average price of all miles that have been deferred. The portion of the revenue received in excess of the fair value is recognized in income immediately and classified as other, net revenue. For mileage credits which we estimate are not likely to be redeemed ( Breakage ), we recognize the associated value proportionally during the period in which the remaining mileage credits are expected to be redeemed. The estimate of Breakage is based on historical redemption patterns. A change in assumptions as to the period over which mileage credits are expected to be redeemed, the actual redemption activity for mileage credits or our estimate of the fair value of mileage credits expected to be redeemed could have a material impact on our revenue in the year in which the change occurs and in future years. At December 31, 2008, the aggregate deferred revenue balance associated with our frequent flyer programs was $5.1 billion. A hypothetical 1% change in our outstanding number of miles estimated to be redeemed would result in a $49 million impact on our deferred revenue liability. Purchase Accounting Measurements. On the Closing Date, Northwest revalued its assets and liabilities at fair value in accordance with Statement of Financial Accounting Standards ( SFAS ) No. 141, Business Combinations ( SFAS 141 ). These changes in value did not result in gains or losses, but were instead an input to the calculation of goodwill related to the excess of purchase price over the fair value of the tangible and identifiable intangible assets acquired and liabilities assumed from Northwest in the Merger. Additional changes in the fair values of these assets and liabilities from the current estimated values, as well as changes in other assumptions, could significantly impact the reported value of goodwill. The fair value of Northwest debt and capital lease obligations was determined by estimating the present value of amounts to be paid at appropriate interest rates as of the Closing Date. These rates were determined with swap rates, LIBOR rates and market spreads as of the Closing Date. The market spreads, which were determined with the assistance of third party financial institutions, took into consideration the credit risk and the structure of the instruments as well as the underlying collateral supporting the instruments. 47 Table of Contents Index to Financial Statements Fair value measurements for goodwill and other intangible assets included significant unobservable inputs, which generally include a five-year business plan, 12-months of historical revenues and expenses by city pair, projections of available seat miles, revenue passenger miles, load factors, and operating costs per available seat mile and a discount rate. One of the significant inputs underlying the intangible fair value measurements performed on the Closing Date is the discount rate. We determined the discount rate using the weighted average cost of capital of the airline industry, which was measured using a Capital Asset Pricing Model ( CAPM ). The CAPM in the valuation of goodwill and indefinite-lived intangibles utilized a 50% debt and 50% equity structure. The historical average debt-to-equity structure of the major airlines since 1990 is also approximately 50% debt and 50% equity, which was similar to Northwest debt-to-equity structure at emergence from Chapter 11. The return on debt was measured using a bid-to-yield analysis of major airline corporate bonds. The expected market rate of return for equity was measured based on the risk free rate, the airline industry beta, and risk premiums based on the Federal Reserve Statistical Release H. 15 or Ibbotson Stocks, Bonds, Bills, and Inflation Valuation Yearbook, Edition 2008. These factors resulted in a 13% discount rate. This compares to an 11% discount rate used at emergence by Northwest. The fair value of Northwest pension and postretirement plans was determined by measuring the plans funded status as of the closing of the Merger. Any excess projected benefit obligation over the fair value of plan assets was recognized as a liability. One of the significant assumptions in determining our projected benefit obligation is the discount rate. We determined the discount rate primarily by reference to annualized rates earned on high quality fixed income investments and yield-to-maturity analysis specific to estimated future benefit payments, which resulted in a weighted average discount rate of 7.8%. Other significant assumptions include the healthcare cost trend rate, retirement age, and mortality assumptions. These assumptions are discussed further in Note 10 of the Notes to the Consolidated Financial Statements. Derivative Instruments. In an effort to manage our exposure to changes in aircraft fuel prices, we periodically enter into derivative instruments comprised of crude oil, heating oil and jet fuel swap, collar, and call option contracts to hedge a portion of our projected aircraft fuel requirements, including those of our Contract Carriers under capacity purchase agreements. We record our derivative contracts in accordance with SFAS No. 133, Accounting for Derivative Instruments and Hedging Activity ( SFAS 133 ). Our fuel derivative instruments are valued using market data derived from quantitative models and processes to generate forward curves and volatilities. We believe our fuel hedge contracts will be highly effective during their term in offsetting changes in cash flow attributable to the volatility in jet fuel prices. We perform both a prospective and retrospective assessment to this effect, at least quarterly, including assessing the possibility of counterparty default. If we determine that a derivative is no longer expected to be highly effective, we discontinue hedge accounting prospectively and recognize subsequent changes in the fair value of the hedge on our Consolidated Statements of Operations. As a result of our effectiveness assessment at December 31, 2008, we believe our hedge contracts will continue to be highly effective in offsetting changes in cash flow attributable to the volatility in jet fuel prices. 48 Table of Contents Index to Financial Statements Goodwill and Other Intangible Assets. Goodwill reflects (1) the excess of the reorganization value of the Successor over the fair value of tangible and identifiable intangible assets, net of liabilities, from the adoption of fresh start reporting, adjusted for impairment, and (2) the excess of purchase price over the fair values of the tangible and identifiable intangible assets acquired and liabilities assumed from Northwest in the Merger. The following table reflects the change in the carrying amount of goodwill for the year ended December 31, 2008: (in millions) Total Balance at December 31, 2007 $ 12,104 Impairment charge (6,939 ) Northwest Merger 4,572 Other (6 ) Balance at December 31, 2008 $ 9,731 During the March 2008 quarter, we experienced a significant decline in market capitalization driven primarily by record fuel prices and overall airline industry conditions. In addition, the announcement of our intention to merge with Northwest established a stock exchange ratio based on the relative valuation of Delta and Northwest. For additional information about the Merger, see Note 2 of the Notes to the Consolidated Financial Statements. We determined that these factors combined with further increases in fuel prices were an indicator that a goodwill impairment test was required pursuant to SFAS No. 142, Goodwill and Other Intangible Assets ( SFAS 142 ). As a result, we estimated fair value based on a discounted projection of future cash flows, supported with a market-based valuation. We determined that goodwill was impaired and recorded a non-cash charge of $6.9 billion for the year ended December 31, 2008. In estimating fair value, we based our estimates and assumptions on the same valuation techniques employed and levels of inputs used to estimate the fair value of goodwill upon adoption of fresh start reporting. Identifiable intangible assets reflect intangible assets (1) recorded as a result of our adoption of fresh start reporting upon emergence from bankruptcy and (2) acquired in the Merger. Indefinite-lived assets are not amortized. Definite-lived intangible assets are amortized on a straight-line basis or under the undiscounted cash flows method over the estimated economic life of the respective agreements and contracts. In addition to the goodwill impairment charge, we recorded a non-cash charge of $357 million ($238 million after tax) for the year ended December 31, 2008 to reduce the carrying value of certain intangible assets based on their revised estimated fair values. In accordance with SFAS 142, we apply a fair value-based impairment test to the net book value of goodwill and indefinite-lived intangible assets on an annual basis and, if certain events or circumstances indicate that an impairment loss may have been incurred, on an interim basis. The annual impairment test date for our goodwill and indefinite-lived intangible assets is October 1. In evaluating our goodwill for impairment, we first compare our one reporting unit fair value to its carrying value. We estimate the fair value of our reporting unit by considering (1) our market capitalization, (2) any premium to our market capitalization an investor would pay for a controlling interest ( Control Premium ), (3) the potential value of synergies and other benefits that could result from such interest, (4) market multiple and recent transaction values of peer companies and (5) projected discounted future cash flows, if reasonably estimable. If the reporting unit fair value exceeds its carrying value, no further testing is required. If, however, the reporting unit carrying value exceeds its fair value, we then determine the amount of the impairment charge, if any. We recognize an impairment charge if the carrying value of the reporting unit goodwill exceeds its implied fair value. We perform the impairment test for our indefinite-lived intangible assets by comparing the asset fair value to its carrying value. Fair value is estimated based on recent market transactions where available or projected discounted future cash flows. We recognize an impairment charge if the asset carrying value exceeds its estimated fair value. 49 Table of Contents Index to Financial Statements At October 1, 2008, we performed an impairment test of our goodwill and indefinite-lived intangible assets, which resulted in no impairment charge. For both goodwill and indefinite-lived intangible assets, changes in assumptions or circumstances, including, but not limited to, (1) negative trends in our market capitalization, (2) volatile fuel prices, (3) declining passenger mile yields, (4) lower demand as a result of the weakening U.S. and global economy, (5) interruption to our operations due to an employee strike, terrorist attack, or other reasons and/or (6) consolidation of competitors within the industry, which are not offset by other factors such as improved yield or an increase in Control Premiums, could result in an impairment in the year in which the change occurs and in future years. For additional information about our accounting policy for goodwill and other intangible assets, see Notes 1 and 5 of the Notes to the Consolidated Financial Statements. Long-Lived Assets . Our flight equipment and other long-lived assets have a recorded value of $20.6 billion on our Consolidated Balance Sheet at December 31, 2008. This value is based on various factors, including the assets estimated useful lives and their estimated salvage values. In accordance with SFAS No. 144, Accounting for the Impairment or Disposal of Long-Lived Assets ( SFAS 144 ), we record impairment losses on long-lived assets used in operations when events and circumstances indicate the assets might be impaired and the estimated future cash flows generated by those assets are less than their carrying amounts. If we decide to permanently remove flight equipment or other long-lived assets from operations, these assets will be evaluated under SFAS 144 and could result in an impairment. The impairment loss recognized is the amount by which the asset carrying amount exceeds its estimated fair value. In order to evaluate potential impairment as required by SFAS 144, we group assets at the fleet type level (the lowest level for which there are identifiable cash flows) and then estimate future cash flows based on projections of passenger yield, fuel costs, labor costs and other relevant factors. We estimate aircraft fair values using published sources, appraisals and bids received from third parties, as available. For additional information about our accounting policy for the impairment of long-lived assets, see Notes 1 and 5 of the Notes to the Consolidated Financial Statements. Income Tax Valuation Allowance and Contingencies . In accordance with SFAS No. 109, Accounting for Income Taxes, deferred tax assets should be reduced by a valuation allowance if it is more likely than not that some portion or all of the deferred tax assets will not be realized. The future realization of our net deferred tax assets depends on the availability of sufficient future taxable income. In making this determination, we consider all available positive and negative evidence and make certain assumptions. We consider, among other things, our deferred tax liabilities, the overall business environment, our historical earnings and losses, our industry historically cyclical periods of earnings and losses, and potential, current and future tax planning strategies. Our income tax provisions are based on calculations and assumptions that are subject to examination by the Internal Revenue Service and other tax authorities. Although we believe that the positions taken on previously filed tax returns are reasonable, we have established tax and interest reserves in recognition that various taxing authorities may challenge the positions we have taken, which could result in additional liabilities for taxes and interest. We review the reserves as circumstances warrant and adjust the reserves as events occur that affect our potential liability, such as lapsing of applicable statutes of limitations, conclusion of tax audits, a change in exposure based on current calculations, identification of new issues, release of administrative guidance or the rendering of a court decision affecting a particular issue. We would adjust the income tax provision in the period in which the facts that give rise to the revision become known. Prior to January 1, 2009, in the event that an adjustment to the income tax provision relates to a pre-emergence tax position or Northwest Merger-related tax position, we would adjust goodwill followed by other indefinite-lived intangible assets until the net carrying value of these assets is zero. Beginning January 1, 2009, any adjustments to the income tax provision in regard to pre-emergence tax positions will be made through the income tax provision pursuant to SFAS No. 141 (revised 2007), Business Combinations ( SFAS 141R ). For additional information about income taxes, see Notes 1 and 9 of the Notes to the Consolidated Financial Statements. 50 Table of Contents Index to Financial Statements Pension Plans . We sponsor DB Plans for our eligible employees and retirees. We currently estimate that expense for our DB Plans in 2009 will be approximately $420 million. The effect of our DB Plans on our Consolidated Financial Statements is subject to many assumptions. We believe the most critical assumptions are (1) the weighted average discount rate and (2) the expected long-term rate of return on the assets of our DB Plans. For additional information regarding these assumptions, see Note 10 of the Notes to the Consolidated Financial Statements. We determine our weighted average discount rate on our measurement date primarily by reference to annualized rates earned on high quality fixed income investments and yield-to-maturity analysis specific to our estimated future benefit payments. We used a weighted average discount rate of 6.49% and 6.37% at December 31, 2008 and 2007, respectively. Additionally, our weighted average discount rate for net periodic benefit cost in each of the past three years has varied from the rate selected on our measurement date, ranging from 5.67% to 7.19% between 2006 and 2008, due to remeasurements throughout the year. The impact of a 0.50% change in our weighted average discount rate is shown in the table below. The expected long-term rate of return on the assets of our DB Plans is based primarily on plan specific investment studies using historical returns on our DB Plans assets with forward looking estimates based on existing financial market conditions and forecasts. Modest excess return expectations versus some market indices are incorporated into the return projections based on the actively managed structure of the investment programs and their records of achieving such returns historically. We review our rate of return on plan asset assumptions annually. These assumptions are largely based on the asset category rate-of-return assumptions developed annually with our pension investment advisors, however, our annual investment performance for one particular year does not, by itself, significantly influence our evaluation. The investment strategy for pension plan assets is to utilize a diversified mix of global public and private equity portfolios, public and private fixed income portfolios, and private real estate and natural resource investments to earn a long-term investment return that meets or exceeds a 9% annualized return target. The impact of a 0.50% change in our expected long-term rate of return is shown in the table below. Change in Assumption Effect on 2009 Pension Expense Effect on Accrued Pension Liability at December 31, 2008 0.50% decrease in discount rate +$8 million +$929 million 0.50% increase in discount rate -$12 million -$878 million 0.50% decrease in expected return on assets +$34 million 0.50% increase in expected return on assets -$34 million For additional information about our pension plans, see Note 10 of the Notes to the Consolidated Financial Statements. Recently Issued Accounting Pronouncements In March 2008, the Financial Accounting Standards Board (the FASB ) issued SFAS No. 161, Disclosures about Derivative Instruments and Hedging Activities an amendment to FASB Statement 133 ( SFAS 161 ). SFAS 161 changes the disclosure requirements for derivative instruments and hedging activities. Entities are required to provide enhanced disclosures about (1) how and why an entity uses derivative instruments, (2) how derivative instruments and related hedged items are accounted for under SFAS 133, and (3) how derivative instruments and related hedged items affect an entity financial position, financial performance and cash flows. SFAS 161 is effective for fiscal years and interim periods beginning on January 1, 2009. We currently provide significant information about our hedging activities and use of derivatives in our quarterly and annual filings. Accordingly, we expect the adoption of SFAS 161 will not have a material impact on our consolidated financial statements and disclosures. 51 Table of Contents Index to Financial Statements In December 2007, the FASB issued SFAS 141R. SFAS 141R provides guidance for recognizing and measuring goodwill acquired in a business combination and requires disclosure of information to enable users of the financial statements to evaluate the nature and financial effects of the business combination. It also revises the treatment of valuation allowance adjustments related to income tax benefits in existence prior to a business combination or prior to the adoption of fresh start reporting. Under SFAS 141, any reduction in the valuation allowance as a result of the recognition of deferred tax assets is adjusted through goodwill, followed by other indefinite-lived intangible assets until the net carrying costs of these assets is zero. By contrast, SFAS 141R requires that any reduction in this valuation allowance be reflected through the income tax provision. SFAS 141R is effective for fiscal years beginning on January 1, 2009. For additional information regarding SFAS 141R, see Note 9 of the Notes to the Consolidated Financial Statements. Glossary of Defined Terms ASM Available Seat Mile. A measure of capacity.
