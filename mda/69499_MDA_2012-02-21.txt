Executive Overview Mylan ranks among the leading generic and specialty pharmaceutical companies in the world, offering one of the industry broadest and highest quality product portfolios, a robust pipeline and a global commercial footprint that spans approximately 150 countries and territories. With a workforce of more than 18,000 employees and external contractors, Mylan has attained leading positions in key international markets through its wide array of dosage forms and delivery systems, significant manufacturing capacity, global scale and commitment to quality and customer service. Through our subsidiary Mylan Laboratories Limited (formerly 51 Table of Contents known as Matrix Laboratories Limited), Mylan operates one of the world largest active pharmaceutical ingredient ( API ) manufacturers with respect to the number of drug master files filed with regulatory agencies. This capability makes Mylan one of only two global generics companies with a comprehensive, vertically integrated supply chain. We hold a leading generics sales position in three of the world largest pharmaceutical markets, those being the United States ( U.S. ), France and the United Kingdom ( U.K. ), and we also hold leading sales positions in several other key generics markets, including Australia, Belgium, Italy, Portugal and Spain. Mylan has two segments, Generics and Specialty. Generics primarily develops, manufactures, sells and distributes generic or branded generic pharmaceutical products in tablet, capsule, injectable or transdermal patch form, as well as API. Specialty engages mainly in the manufacture and sale of branded specialty nebulized and injectable products. We also report in Corporate/Other certain research and development expenses, general and administrative expenses, litigation settlements, amortization of intangible assets and certain purchase-accounting items, impairment charges, and other items not directly attributable to the segments. Acquisition of the Respiratory Delivery Platform On December 23, 2011, we completed the acquisition of the exclusive worldwide rights to develop, manufacture and commercialize a generic equivalent to GlaxoSmithKline Advair Diskus and Seretide Diskus incorporating Pfizer Inc. ( Pfizer ) proprietary dry powder inhaler delivery platform (the Respiratory Delivery Platform ). Advair Diskus and Seretide Diskus are inhaled fixed-dose combinations of Fluticasone Propionate and Salmeterol delivered via a dry powder inhaler and are used to treat asthma and COPD (chronic obstructive pulmonary disorder). The acquisition of the Respiratory Delivery Platform fills an important strategic gap in our product portfolio and will expand our focus on difficult-to-produce, limited competition products, and it will serve as a base for our respiratory franchise. The Respiratory Delivery Platform and scientific expertise will also be used to develop additional branded specialty products, building upon the capabilities and assets that we have in place within our Specialty segment. As part of the agreement, we will fund the remaining development and capital requirements to bring the products to market. This transaction was accounted for as a purchase of a business with a total purchase consideration of approximately $348 million. This amount consisted of an initial cash payment of approximately $22 million, approximately $4 million in assumed liabilities and contingent consideration with an estimated fair value of approximately $322 million to be paid upon the achievement of future development and commercial milestones and the sharing of future profits. Senior Credit Agreement Refinancing and Receivables Agreement In November 2011, we entered into a credit agreement (the Senior Credit Agreement ) with a syndication of banks which provided $1.25 billion in U.S. Term Loans (the U.S. Term Loans ) and contains a $1.25 billion revolving facility (the Revolving Facility, and together with the U.S. Term Loans, the Senior Credit Facilities ). The proceeds of the U.S. Term Loans and borrowings under the Revolving Facility were used to repay amounts outstanding under the 2007 Amended and Restated Credit Agreement (the Prior Credit Agreement ) and to pay the related fees and expenses of the foregoing transactions. In February 2012, we entered into an agreement with a syndication of banks to borrow up to $300 million secured by certain U.S. accounts receivable. This agreement has a maturity of three years and is a committed facility. Financial Summary For the year ended December 31, 2011, Mylan reported total revenues of $6.13 billion compared to $5.45 billion for 2010. This represents an increase of $679.3 million, or 12.5%. Consolidated gross profit for the 52 Table of Contents current year was $2.56 billion, compared to $2.22 billion in the prior year, an increase of $346.0 million, or 15.6%. For the current year, earnings from operations were $1.01 billion as compared to $721.6 million in the prior year, an increase of $283.9 million or 39.3%. The net earnings attributable to Mylan Inc. common shareholders for the current year were $536.8 million, and earnings per diluted share were $1.22. In the prior year, net earnings attributable to Mylan Inc. common shareholders were $223.6 million, or earnings of $0.68 per diluted share. A more detailed discussion of the company financial results can be found below in the section titled Results of Operations. Included in the results for 2011 and 2010 are the following items of note: 2011: Amortization expense, primarily related to purchased intangible assets associated with acquisitions, of $364.8 million, which includes a $16.2 million in-process research and development asset impairment charge; Interest expense of $49.8 million, primarily related to the amortization of the discounts on our convertible debt instruments and 2018 Senior Notes, net of amortization of the premium on our 2020 Senior Notes; Net charges related to the settlement of litigation of $48.6 million; Charges, related to the 2011 refinancing transactions of $34.0 million, primarily swap termination fees and the write-off of deferred financing costs included in other (expense) income, net; Additional expenses, primarily restructuring related items totaling $57.1 million; and Tax expense of $198.1 million related to the above items and other income tax related items. 2010: Amortization expense, primarily related to purchased intangible assets associated with acquisitions, of $309.2 million; Interest expense of $60.0 million, primarily related to the amortization of the discounts on our convertible debt instruments and 2018 Senior Notes, net of amortization of the premium on our 2020 Senior Notes; Net charges related to the settlement of litigation of $127.1 million; Charges, related to the 2010 refinancing transactions, of $37.4 million, primarily swap termination fees and the write-off of deferred financing costs included in other (expense) income, net; Costs related to the acquisition of Bioniche Pharma Holdings Limited ( Bioniche Pharma ) in September 2010 of $12.7 million; Additional expenses, primarily restructuring, product transfers and loss on sale of certain non-operating assets totaling $68.5 million; and Tax expense of $252.8 million related to the above items and other income tax related items; and For comparative purposes, 2009 included the following items of note: Amortization expense, primarily related to purchased intangible assets associated with acquisitions, of $282.5 million; Interest expense of $42.9 million relating to the amortization of the discounts on our convertible debt instruments; 53 Table of Contents Other revenue of approximately $28.5 million resulting from the cancellation of product development agreements for which the revenue had been previously deferred; Net charges related to the settlement of litigation of $225.7 million; An upfront payment of $18.0 million made with respect to the execution of a co-development agreement; Rebranding costs associated with a migration to the Mylan brand for the former Merck Generics business totaling $21.4 million; Additional costs, primarily restructuring, totaling $60.7 million; Tax expense of $207.5 million related to the above items and other income tax related items; and Income tax expense of approximately $65.0 million related to losses recognized as a result of reorganizations among certain of our foreign subsidiaries. 2011 Compared to 2010 Total Revenues and Gross Profit For the year ended December 31, 2011, Mylan reported total revenues of $6.13 billion compared to $5.45 billion in the prior year. Total revenues include both net revenues and other revenues from third parties. Third party net revenues for the current year were $6.11 billion compared to $5.40 billion for the prior year, representing an increase of $702.0 million, or 13.0%. Other third party revenues for the current year were $23.5 million compared to $46.3 million in the prior year, a decrease of $22.8 million, primarily due to a decrease in royalty income in 2011. Mylan revenues are impacted by the effect of foreign currency translation, primarily reflecting changes in the U.S. dollar in comparison to the functional currencies of Mylan Euro-denominated subsidiaries, as well as the currencies of Mylan subsidiaries in Australia, Japan and India. The favorable impact of foreign currency translation on current year total revenues was approximately 2%. In arriving at net revenues, gross revenues are reduced by provisions for estimates, including discounts, rebates, promotions, price adjustments, returns and chargebacks. See the section titled Application of Critical Accounting Policies in this Item 7, for a thorough discussion of our methodology with respect to such provisions. For 2011, the most significant amounts charged against gross revenues were $2.13 billion related to chargebacks and $1.26 billion related to incentives offered to our direct customers, such as promotions and volume related incentives. For 2010, the most significant amounts charged against gross revenues were for chargebacks in the amount of $2.07 billion and incentives offered to our direct customers in the amount of $1.27 billion. Gross profit for the current year was $2.56 billion and gross margins were 41.8%. For 2010, gross profit was $2.22 billion, and gross margins were 40.7%. Gross profit for the current year is impacted by purchase accounting and other special items recorded during 2011, of approximately $373.2 million, which consisted primarily of amortization related to purchased intangible assets associated with acquisitions. Excluding such items, gross margins would have been approximately 48%. Prior year gross profit is also impacted by similar purchase accounting and other special items in the amount of $315.9 million. Excluding such items, gross margins in the prior year would have also been approximately 47%. The increase in gross margins is primarily the result of new products launched in the North American region of our Generics segment and favorable pricing on the EpiPen Auto-Injector in our Specialty segment and the continued vertical integration and leveraging of our manufacturing platform. From time to time, a limited number of our products may represent a significant portion of our net revenues, gross profit and net earnings. Generally, this is due to the timing of new product launches and the amount, if any, 54 Table of Contents of additional competition in the market. Our top ten products in terms of sales, in the aggregate, represented approximately 23% of total revenues in both 2011 and 2010. Generics Segment Net Revenues For the current year, Generics third party net revenues were $5.56 billion compared to $4.98 billion in the prior year, an increase of $577.4 million, or 11.6%. Translating Generics 2011 third party net revenues at prior year comparative period foreign current exchange rates would have resulted in year-over-year growth of approximately 9%. Generics sales are derived primarily in or from the U.S. and Canada (collectively North America ), Europe, Middle East and Africa (collectively, EMEA ) and India, Australia, Japan, and New Zealand (collectively, Asia Pacific ). Third party net revenues from North America were $2.86 billion for the current year, compared to $2.36 billion for the prior year, representing an increase of $496.1 million, or 21.0%. The increase in current year net revenues was primarily driven by new product launches and increased volume, including incremental revenue from the Bioniche Pharma acquisition in September 2010, together totaling approximately $427.9 million in the current year. During 2011, we launched approximately 50 new products in North America. Products generally contribute most significantly to revenues and gross margin at the time of their launch, even more so in periods of market exclusivity, or in periods of limited generic competition. As such, the timing of new product introductions can have a significant impact on Mylan financial results. The entrance into the market of additional competition generally has a negative impact on the volume and pricing of the affected products. Additionally, pricing is often affected by factors outside of the Company control. In the current year, lower pricing, generally the result of increased competition, partially offset the favorable volume realized on sales of existing products. The effect of foreign currency translation was insignificant within North America. Third party net revenues from EMEA were $1.47 billion in 2011, compared to $1.55 billion in 2010, a decrease of $79.9 million, or 5.2%. However, translating current year third party net revenues from EMEA at prior year exchange rates would result in a decrease of approximately $146 million, or 9%. This decrease was the result of unfavorable pricing in nearly all of the European markets in which Mylan operates. Revenue from the launch of new products throughout Europe served to offset unfavorable volume on existing products in certain markets, primarily France, the United Kingdom and Germany. Local currency revenues from Mylan business in France decreased as compared to the prior year as a result of the impact of lower pricing and volume due to an increasingly competitive market, partially offset by new product launches. Despite the competitive market conditions, the market share in France remained relatively stable in 2011 as compared to 2010, and we remain the market leader. In Italy, excluding the effect of foreign currency, third party net revenues increased more than 20% as a result of successful product launches and increased market penetration, which has favorably affected sales volume. Italy is one of the fastest growing markets in Europe. Our growth in Italy outpaced the market in terms of both volume and sales value. In Spain, another fast-growing market, we saw significant growth in our market share in terms of volume, while our share in terms of value remained constant. This is due, in part, to government-imposed price reductions which resulted in overall unfavorable pricing. This unfavorable pricing was partially offset by revenue from new products and incremental volume on our existing portfolio. In addition to Spain and Italy, certain other markets in which we do business have recently undergone government-imposed price reductions, and further government-imposed price reductions are expected in the future. Such measures, along with the tender systems discussed below, are likely to have a negative impact on 55 Table of Contents sales and gross profit in these markets. However, pro-generic government initiatives in certain markets could help to offset some of this unfavorable effect by potentially increasing rates of generic substitution. A number of markets in which we operate have implemented or may implement tender systems for generic pharmaceuticals in an effort to lower prices. Generally speaking, tender systems can have an unfavorable impact on revenue and profitability. Under such tender systems, manufacturers submit bids which establish prices for generic pharmaceutical products. Upon winning the tender, the winning company will receive a preferential reimbursement for a period of time. The tender system often results in companies underbidding one another by proposing low pricing in order to win the tender. Additionally, the loss of a tender by a third party to whom we supply API can also have a negative impact on our sales and profitability. Sales, primarily in Germany, continue to be negatively affected by the impact of tender systems. In Asia Pacific, third party net revenues were $1.24 billion in 2011, compared to $1.07 billion in 2010, an increase of $161.2 million, or 15.0%. Excluding the favorable effect of foreign currency translation, calculated as described above, the increase was approximately $113 million, or 11%. This increase was primarily driven by higher third party sales by Mylan Laboratories Limited. At Mylan Laboratories Limited, the increase in third party net revenues is due to double-digit growth, excluding the effect of foreign currency, in sales of both anti-retroviral ( ARV ) finished dosage form ( FDF ) generic products, which are used in the treatment of HIV/AIDS, and API. In addition to third party sales, the Asia Pacific region also supplies both FDF generic products and API to Mylan subsidiaries in conjunction with Mylan vertical integration strategy. Intercompany revenues recognized by the Asia Pacific region were $216.7 million in 2011, compared to $162.2 million in the prior year. These intercompany sales eliminate within, and therefore are not included in, Generics or consolidated net revenues. In Japan, third party net revenues increased mainly as a result of favorable volume. In Australia, local currency sales decreased versus the prior year as sales growth from new products was offset by lower pricing. As in EMEA, government-imposed price reductions in Japan and Australia have had, and could continue to have, a negative impact on sales and gross profit in these markets. Specialty Segment Net Revenues For the current year, Specialty reported third party net revenues of $547.4 million, an increase of $124.6 million, or 29.5%, from the prior year of $422.8 million. The most significant contributor to Specialty revenues continues to be the EpiPen Auto-Injector, which is used in the treatment of severe allergic reactions, including anaphylaxis. The EpiPen Auto-Injector is the number one epinephrine auto-injector for the treatment of severe allergic reactions with more than 95% market share in the U.S. and more than 90% market share worldwide. Specialty realized increased sales of the EpiPen Auto-Injector as a result of favorable pricing and increased volume. In addition to the continued strong sales of the EpiPen Auto-Injector, the increase in third-party sales included higher sales volumes of Perforomist Solution, Dey maintenance therapy for patients with moderate to severe chronic obstructive pulmonary disease. Operating Expenses Research and development ( R&D ) expense in 2011 was $294.7 million, compared to $282.1 million in the same prior year period, an increase of $12.6 million, with approximately $6 million of this increase due to the unfavorable impact from foreign currency, and the remainder due to the inclusion of Bioniche Pharma for a full year. As it relates to the 2011 R&D expense, we continue to invest in new FDF products and API, while increasing our investment in our biologics and specialty platforms. 56 Table of Contents Selling, general and administrative ( SG&A ) expense for the current year was $1.21 billion, compared to $1.09 billion for the prior year, an increase of $128.0 million. In addition to incremental expense as a result of foreign currency and the Bioniche Pharma acquisition, SG&A increased primarily due to increased payroll and benefit costs, legal costs and higher marketing expense in the Specialty segment, in conjunction with various advertising campaigns related to the EpiPen Auto-Injector. Litigation Settlements, net During 2011, we recorded net litigation charges of $48.6 million, compared to $127.1 million during the prior year. In 2011, the net charges for litigation settlements principally related to an adverse ruling for an anti-competition claim in France, which resulted in a charge of $24.0 million and a patent infringement claim, which resulted in a charge of $18.0 million. In 2010, we recorded pre-tax charges of $66.0 million in 2010 related to settlements in principal to resolve certain claims and estimated potential losses on other claims related to our outstanding pricing litigation. In addition, in 2010, the Company recorded pre-tax charges of approximately $41.0 million to reserve for estimated potential losses and settlements in principle related to certain product liability claims. Interest Expense Interest expense for 2011 totaled $335.9 million, compared to $331.5 million for 2010. The increase is primarily due to a full year of interest associated with the 2017, 2018 and 2020 Senior Notes debt offerings in 2010, partially offset by a decrease in the amortization of discounts. Included in interest expense for the current year and the prior year are $49.8 million and $60.0 million primarily related to the amortization of the discounts on our convertible debt instruments and the 2018 Senior Notes, net of amortization of the premium on our 2020 Senior Notes. Other (Expense) Income, net Other (expense) income, net, was expense of $14.9 million in the current year compared to expense of $34.2 million in the prior year. Generally included in other (expense) income, net, are certain foreign exchange gains and losses and interest and dividend income. Additionally, included in the current year are charges associated with the termination of certain interest rate swaps totaling $13.9 million and the write-off of previously deferred financing fees of $20.1 million related to the refinancing of the senior credit facility. The prior year includes a $4.9 million loss on the sale of certain non-operating assets, charges associated with the termination of certain interest rate swaps totaling $18.6 million and the write-off of previously deferred financing fees of $18.8 million. Income Tax Expense We recorded income tax expense of $115.8 million in 2011 compared to expense of $10.4 million in 2010, an increase of $105.4 million. This increase was primarily due to a higher effective tax rate and an increase in pre-tax income. The increase in the effective tax rate was the result of a greater amount of 2010 net reductions in previously established reserves for uncertain tax positions as compared to 2011. In both periods, the decreases to our tax reserves were due to favorable rulings from taxing authorities, expirations of statutes of limitations, and participation in voluntary disclosure agreements with certain tax jurisdictions. Additional factors affecting the Company effective tax rate were changes in losses by certain foreign subsidiaries for which the Company has not recorded a tax benefit and differing levels of income in tax jurisdictions with differing statutory tax rates. 2010 Compared to 2009 Total Revenues and Gross Profit For the year ended December 31, 2010, Mylan reported total revenues of $5.45 billion compared to $5.09 billion in 2009. Total revenues include both net revenues and other revenues from third parties. Third party 57 Table of Contents net revenues for 2010 were $5.40 billion compared to $5.02 billion for 2009, representing an increase of $388.9 million, or 7.8%. Other third party revenues for 2010 were $46.3 million compared to $77.4 million in 2009, a decrease of $31.1 million. In 2009, within Generics, we recognized $28.5 million of incremental other revenue resulting from the cancellation of product development agreements for which the revenue had been previously deferred. During 2010, no such revenue was recognized. The favorable impact of foreign currency translation on total revenues was less than 1%. In arriving at net revenues, gross revenues were reduced by provisions for estimates, including discounts, rebates, promotions, price adjustments, returns and chargebacks. For 2010, the most significant amounts charged against gross revenues were for chargebacks in the amount of $2.07 billion. For 2009, the most significant amounts charged against gross revenues were for chargebacks in the amount of $1.89 billion. Gross profit for 2010 was $2.22 billion and gross margins were 40.7%. For 2009, gross profit was $2.07 billion, and gross margins were also 40.7%. Gross profit for 2010 was impacted by certain purchase accounting related items recorded during the year of approximately $309.2 million, which consisted primarily of amortization related to purchased intangible assets associated with acquisitions. Excluding such items, gross margins would have been approximately 46%. Gross profit for 2009 was also impacted by similar purchase accounting related items in the amount of $282.5 million. Excluding such items, gross margins in 2009 would have also been approximately 46%. From time to time, a limited number of our products may represent a significant portion of our net revenues, gross profit and net earnings. Generally, this is due to the timing of new product launches and the amount, if any, of additional competition in the market. Our top ten products in terms of sales, in the aggregate, represented approximately 23% of total revenues in 2010. Generics Segment Net Revenues For 2010, Generics third party net revenues were $4.98 billion compared to $4.61 billion in 2009, an increase of $371.4 million, or 8.1%. Translating Generics 2010 third party net revenues at prior year comparative period foreign currency exchange rates would have resulted in year-over-year growth of approximately 7% or $320 million. This increase is due principally to new product launches and, to a lesser extent, revenue from acquired businesses, together totaling approximately $269 million. Third party net revenues from existing products were relatively constant year over year, with the increase in volume almost fully offset by lower pricing. Third party net revenues from North America were $2.36 billion for 2010, compared to $2.09 billion for 2009, representing an increase of $265.0 million, or 12.6%. The increase in 2010 net revenues was driven principally by new product launches, and to a lesser extent, revenue from acquired businesses, together totaling approximately $213 million. North American third party net revenues from existing products were relatively constant year over year with increased volume as a result of Mylan ability to continue to be a stable and reliable source of supply to the market, almost fully offset by lower pricing. The effect of foreign currency translation was insignificant within North America. The entrance into the market of additional competition generally has a negative impact on the volume and pricing of the affected products. Such competition, including additional generic competition on divalproex sodium extended-release ( divalproex ER ) tablets, the generic version of Abbott Laboratories Depakote ER, which entered the market in August 2009, contributed to the lower pricing. Products generally contribute most significantly to revenues and gross margin at the time of their launch, even more so in periods of market exclusivity, as was the case with divalproex ER, or in periods of limited generic competition. As such, the timing of new product introductions can have a significant impact on Mylan financial results. 58 Table of Contents Upon receiving final approval from the FDA in July 2010, Mylan commenced immediate shipment of minocycline ER. Mylan also reached settlement and license agreements with Medicis resolving patent litigation relating to minocycline ER, and the Company ceased additional distribution. Pursuant to the terms of the agreements, Medicis released Mylan from any liability related to the prior sales of the product, and Mylan had the right to market minocycline ER in the U.S. beginning in November 2011, or earlier under certain circumstances. As a result of significant uncertainties surrounding the pricing and market conditions with respect to this product, we were not able to reasonably estimate the amount of potential price adjustments, including product returns. Therefore, revenues on shipments of this product were deferred until the resolution of such uncertainties. Such uncertainties were resolved upon our customers sale of this product. As a result, the Company had recognized revenue only upon our customers sale of this product. Third party net revenues from EMEA were $1.55 billion in 2010, compared to $1.64 billion in 2009, a decrease of $90.8 million, or 5.5%. However, translating 2010 third party net revenues from EMEA at 2009 exchange rates would result in a decrease of approximately $24 million, or 1%. This decrease was mainly the result of unfavorable pricing in many of the European markets in which Mylan operates, partially offset by new product launches throughout EMEA and a strong performance in Italy. Excluding the unfavorable effect of foreign currency translation, our business in France experienced a low single digit year over year decline in third party net revenues primarily due to unfavorable pricing as a result of increased competition. Such competition in France included the launch, by brand companies, of generic versions of their own products. Despite this local currency decline during 2010, the market share of our French business remained relatively stable in 2010 as compared to 2009. In Italy, excluding the effect of foreign currency, third party sales increased by approximately 43% as a result of successful product launches and increased market penetration, which had favorably affected sales volume. In addition, our Italian business benefitted from certain regulatory changes in early 2010 which resulted in an overall positive pricing effect. In June 2010, additional regulatory changes were introduced which decreased prices on certain products, partially offsetting these positive pricing impacts. Sales in Germany were negatively affected by the continued implementation of tender systems in that country, while certain of our subsidiaries, in particular, the Netherlands, have benefited from recent tenders. In Asia Pacific, third party net revenues were $1.07 billion in 2010, compared to $877.1 million in 2009, an increase of $197.2 million, or 22.5%. Excluding the favorable effect of foreign currency translation, calculated as described above, the increase was approximately $108 million, or 12%. This increase is primarily driven by higher third party sales by Mylan Laboratories Limited. At Mylan Laboratories Limited, the increase in third party net revenues was due to double-digit growth, excluding the effect of foreign currency, in sales of both ARV FDF generic products, which are used in the treatment of HIV/AIDS, and API. In addition to third party sales, the Asia Pacific region also supplied both FDF generic products and API to Mylan subsidiaries in conjunction with Mylan vertical integration strategy. Intercompany revenues recognized by the Asia Pacific region were $162.2 million in 2010, compared to $67.8 million in 2009. These intercompany sales eliminate within, and therefore are not included in, Generics or consolidated net revenues. In Japan, third party net revenues were favorably impacted by increasing government promotion of generic drugs through incentives to pharmacies, as well as through new product launches. In Australia, the impact of new product launches and favorable product mix were more than offset by the impact of government-imposed price reductions as local currency third party net revenues experienced a low single digit year over year decrease. As in EMEA, both Japan and Australia underwent government-imposed price reductions which have had a negative impact on sales and gross profit in these markets. 59 Table of Contents Specialty Segment Net Revenues For 2010, Specialty reported third party net revenues of $422.8 million, an increase of $17.5 million, or 4.3%, from 2009 of $405.3 million. Intercompany sales by Specialty totaled $61.8 million in 2010 compared to $40.8 million in 2009. The increase was due to the fact that certain generic products previously sold to third parties by Specialty are now sold to Mylan subsidiaries in North America who, in turn, sell the products to third parties. These generic products contributed $46.8 million to total revenues of the Specialty Segment in 2009. Excluding the sale of such products from 2009 third party net revenues would have resulted in an increase in third party net revenues in 2010 of $64.3 million or 17.9%. The most significant contributor to Specialty revenues during 2010 was the EpiPen Auto-Injector. The EpiPen Auto-Injector was the number one epinephrine auto-injector for the treatment of severe allergic reactions with more than 95% market share in the U.S. and more than 90% market share worldwide. Specialty realized increased sales of the EpiPen Auto-Injector as a result of favorable pricing and increased volume. In addition to the continued strong sales of the EpiPen Auto-Injector, the increase in third-party sales included higher sales volumes of Perforomist Inhalation Solution, Dey maintenance therapy for patients with moderate to severe chronic obstructive pulmonary disease. Operating Expenses R&D expense in 2010 was $282.1 million, compared to $275.3 million in 2009, an increase of $6.8 million, with almost one-third of this increase due to the unfavorable impact from foreign currency. Included in R&D in 2009 was an up-front payment of $18.0 million related to our execution of a co-development agreement. Excluding this payment, as well as the effect of foreign currency, R&D increased due primarily to costs associated with higher volumes of internal and external product development and resulting submissions and R&D expense related to Bioniche Pharma. SG&A expense for 2010 was $1.09 billion, compared to $1.05 billion for 2009, an increase of $36.5 million. SG&A increased primarily as a result of increased legal costs and higher professional fees, including those related to the acquisition of Bioniche Pharma, and an unfavorable impact from foreign currency, partially offset by cost savings which resulted from restructuring programs undertaken in prior years. Litigation Settlements, net During 2010, we recorded net litigation charges of $127.1 million, compared to $225.7 million during 2009. Litigation settlements, net, during 2010 consisted primarily of charges related to the outstanding pricing litigation and product liability-related matters. With regard to our outstanding pricing litigation, the Company recorded pre-tax charges of $66.0 million in 2010 and $160.0 million in 2009 related to settlements in principal to resolve certain claims and estimated potential losses on other claims. In addition, the Company recorded pre-tax charges of approximately $41.0 million in 2010 to reserve for estimated potential losses and settlements in principle related to certain product liability claims. Also included in 2009 was a pre-tax charge of $121.0 million, related to the settlement of an investigation by the U.S. Department of Justice concerning calculations of Medicaid drug rebates, partially offset by certain litigation-related recoveries. Interest Expense Interest expense for 2010 totaled $331.5 million, compared to $318.5 million for 2009. The increase was primarily due to higher interest associated with the 2010 debt offerings and the amortization of discounts. Included in interest expense for 2010 and 2009 were $60.0 million and $42.9 million primarily related to the amortization of the discounts on our convertible debt instruments and the 2018 Senior Notes, net of amortization of the premium on our 2020 Senior Notes. 60 Table of Contents Other (Expense) Income, net Other (expense) income, net, was expense of $34.2 million in 2010 compared to income of $22.1 million in 2009. Generally included in other (expense) income, net, are interest and dividend income and foreign exchange transaction gains and losses. Additionally, included in 2010 was a $4.9 million loss on the sale of certain non-operating assets, charges associated with the termination of certain interest rate swaps totaling $18.6 million and the write-off of previously deferred financing fees of $18.8 million related to the repayment of the senior credit facility debt. Other income in 2009 included a favorable adjustment of $13.9 million to the restructuring reserve as a result of a reduction in the estimated remaining spending on accrued projects, as well as a net gain of $10.4 million realized on the termination of two joint ventures by our Mylan Laboratories Limited subsidiary, partially offset by an $11.7 million loss on the sale, by Mylan Laboratories Limited, of a majority owned subsidiary. Income Tax Expense We recorded income tax expense of $10.4 million in 2010, compared to a $20.8 million benefit for 2009. 2010 included a net foreign tax credit of $28.0 million, while 2009 included a $65.0 million tax benefit related to losses recognized as a result of reorganizations among certain of our foreign subsidiaries. In addition to these items, the change in the provision year over year was driven primarily by changes in losses of certain foreign subsidiaries for which we have not recognized the related income tax benefit and different levels of income in different tax jurisdictions. Also, there were net decreases to our tax reserves due to favorable tax rulings from taxing authorities, expirations of statutes of limitations, and participation in voluntary disclosure agreements with certain tax jurisdictions. Liquidity and Capital Resources Our primary source of liquidity is cash provided by operations, which was $720.4 million for the year ended December 31, 2011. We believe that cash provided by operating activities and available liquidity will continue to allow us to meet our needs for working capital, capital expenditures, interest and principal payments on debt obligations and other cash needs. Nevertheless, our ability to satisfy our working capital requirements and debt service obligations, or fund planned capital expenditures, will substantially depend upon our future operating performance (which will be affected by prevailing economic conditions), and financial, business and other factors, some of which are beyond our control. Net cash provided by operating activities decreased by $211.0 million to $720.4 million for the year ended December 31, 2011, as compared to $931.4 million for the year ended December 31, 2010. The net decrease in cash provided by operating activities was principally due to the following: a net increase in the amount of cash used by changes in accounts receivable of $340.7 million, as a result of higher receivable balances at December 31, 2011, due principally to the increase in sales in the fourth quarter of 2011, and cash received for deferred revenue in 2010; the receipt of an income tax refund in the first quarter of 2010 of approximately $99 million and lower income taxes paid as a result of anticipated tax benefits on indemnified litigation; a net increase of $125.9 million in the amount of cash used by changes in inventory balances. At December 31, 2011, inventories increased to support an expected increase in future demand combined with anticipated new product launches in 2012; a payment, during 2011, of $60.4 million to Merck KGaA related to the income tax benefits on indemnified litigation; and payments for existing litigation matters totaling $80.8 million. These net decreases were partially offset by an increase in net earnings of $193.3 million, an increase in non-cash depreciation and amortization expense of $87.9 million, and a net increase of $110.6 million in cash 61 Table of Contents provided by changes in trade accounts payable due to a corresponding increase in inventory and the timing of payments. For 2012, the timing of litigation settlements, income taxes and amounts due to Merck KGaA related to the anticipated income tax benefits on indemnified litigation may lead to a reduction of $100 million or more in cash flows from operations as compared to 2011. Net cash provided by operating activities increased by $326.3 million to $931.4 million for the year ended December 31, 2010 as compared to $605.1 million for the year ended December 31, 2009. The net increase in cash provided by operating activities was principally due to the following : an increase in net income of $97.8 million; a net increase in the amount of cash provided by changes in accounts receivable of $197.7 million, as a result of the timing of both sales and cash collections; a net increase in the amount of cash provided by changes in income taxes of $136.0 million, driven primarily by the receipt of an income tax refund in the first quarter of 2010 of approximately $99 million and lower income taxes paid as a result of anticipated tax benefits on the indemnified litigation; a net increase in the amount of cash provided by changes in deferred income taxes of $165.9 million due to a lower amount of net deferred tax assets generated during 2010; a net decrease of $114.8 million in the amount of cash generated through changes in inventory balances. In the current year, inventories increased to support an expected increase in future demand, whereas in the prior year inventory balances decreased as a result of the timing of shipments near year end; and a net decrease of $168.9 million in the amount of cash provided by changes in other assets and liabilities. The current year includes a reduction, as a result of continued spending, in certain restructuring reserves, as well as the payment of approximately $69 million with respect to the Company pricing litigation settlements. Cash used in investing activities was $332.0 million for the year ended December 31, 2011 as compared to $725.4 million for the year ended December 31, 2010, a decrease of $393.4 million. This decrease is the result of less cash paid for acquisitions in 2011 in the amount of $482.3 million, offset by an increase in current year capital expenditures of $87.1 million. In 2010, we acquired Bioniche Pharma, a privately held, global injectable pharmaceutical company, for $543.7 million. In 2011, cash paid for acquisitions totaled $80.5 million. Additionally, non-cash investing activities in 2011 included the acquisition of intangible assets through contingent consideration in the amount of approximately $376.1 million, most of which relates to our acquisition of the Respiratory Delivery Platform. Capital expenditures, primarily for property, plant and equipment, were $279.8 million in the current year. The increase over 2010 is the result of our previously announced planned expansions and integration plans, and includes the timing of expenditures. While there can be no assurance that current expectations will be realized, we expect to continue to invest in our future growth and expect capital expenditures for 2012 to be between $300 million and $400 million. Cash used in financing activities was $645.0 million for year ended December 31, 2011 as compared to cash provided by financing activities of $100.4 million for the year ended December 31, 2010, a net decrease of $745.4 million . Cash used in financing activities consists primarily of approximately $350.0 million to repurchase approximately 14.8 million shares of common stock as part of a repurchase program authorized in the second quarter of 2011, $201.8 million in net repayments on our debt, and $150.0 million to amend and exchange warrants outstanding under the Cash Convertible Notes. In the prior year, net proceeds from the issuance of long term debt yielded a cash inflow of $241.2 million, which was partially offset by preferred dividend payments of $139.0 million. 62 Table of Contents We believe that through the refinancing of our Prior Credit Agreement, and several capital market transactions completed in 2010 and 2011, Mylan debt maturity schedule was substantially improved. The Company has approximately $694 million due in 2012, of which $600 million relates to a convertible note maturing on March 15, 2012, and approximately $94 million due in 2013. Our current intention is to repay such amounts at maturity using available liquidity or our Receivables Facility. As of December 31, 2011, because the closing price of our common stock for at least 20 trading days in the period of 30 consecutive trading days ending on the last trading day in the December 31, 2011 period was more than 130% of the applicable conversion reference price of $13.32 at December 31, 2011, the $575.0 million of Cash Convertible Notes were currently convertible. Although the Company experience is that convertible debentures are not normally converted by investors until close to their maturity date, it is possible that debentures could be converted prior to their maturity date if, for example, a holder perceives the market for the debentures to be weaker than the market for the common stock. Upon an investor election to convert, the Company is required to pay the full conversion value in cash. The amount payable per $1,000 notional bond would be calculated as the product of (1) the conversion reference rate (currently 75.0751) and (2) the average Daily Volume Weighted Average Price per share of common stock for a specified period following the conversion date. Any payment above the principal amount is matched by a convertible note hedge. Should holders elect to convert, we intend to draw on our revolving credit facility to fund any principal payments. The facility is a secured revolving credit agreement expiring in November 2016, with available capacity of $1.2 billion at December 31, 2011. We are involved in various legal proceedings that are considered normal to our business. While it is not possible to predict the outcome of such proceedings, an adverse outcome in any of these proceedings could materially affect our financial position and results of operations, including our operating cash flow. We have approximately $200 million accrued for such legal contingencies. Additionally, for certain contingencies assumed in conjunction with the acquisition of the former Merck Generics business, Merck KGaA, the seller, has indemnified Mylan. The inability or denial of Merck KGaA to pay on an indemnified claim could have a material adverse effect on our financial position, results of operations or cash flows. We are actively pursuing, and are currently involved in, joint projects related to the development, distribution and marketing of both generic and branded products. Many of these arrangements provide for payments by us upon the attainment of specified milestones. While these arrangements help to reduce the financial risk for unsuccessful projects, fulfillment of specified milestones or the occurrence of other obligations may result in fluctuations in cash flows. We are continuously evaluating the potential acquisition of products, as well as companies, as a strategic part of our future growth. Consequently, we may utilize current cash reserves or incur additional indebtedness to finance any such acquisitions, which could impact future liquidity. In addition, on an ongoing basis, we review our operations including the evaluation of potential divestitures of products and businesses as part of our future strategy. Any divestitures could impact future liquidity. At December 31, 2011 and December 31, 2010, we had $79.8 million and $85.4 million outstanding under existing letters of credit. Additionally, as of December 31, 2011, we had $80.4 million available under the $125.0 million subfacility on our Senior Credit Agreement for the issuance of letters of credit. 63 Table of Contents Mandatory minimum repayments remaining on the outstanding borrowings under the term loans and notes at December 31, 2011, excluding the discounts, premium and conversion features, are as follows for each of the periods ending December 31: U.S. Term Loans Senior Convertible Notes Cash Convertible Notes 2017 Senior Notes 2018 Senior Notes 2020 Senior Notes Total (In thousands) 2012 $ 93,750 $ 600,000 $ $ $ $ $ 693,750 2013 93,750 93,750 2014 125,000 125,000 2015 187,500 575,000 762,500 2016 750,000 750,000 Thereafter 550,000 800,000 1,000,000 2,350,000 Total $ 1,250,000 $ 600,000 $ 575,000 $ 550,000 $ 800,000 $ 1,000,000 $ 4,775,000 The Senior Credit Agreement contains customary affirmative covenants for facilities of this type, including among others, covenants pertaining to the delivery of financial statements, notices of default and certain material events, maintenance of business and insurance, collateral matters and compliance with laws, as well as customary negative covenants for facilities of this type, including limitations on the incurrence of indebtedness and liens, mergers and certain other fundamental changes, investments and loans, acquisitions, transactions with affiliates, dispositions of assets, payments of dividends and other restricted payments, prepayments or amendments to the terms of specified indebtedness and changes in our lines of business. The Senior Credit Agreement contains financial covenants requiring maintenance of a minimum interest coverage ratio and a maximum consolidated leverage ratio. We have been compliant with the financial covenants during 2011, and we expect to remain in compliance for the next twelve months. Contractual Obligations The following table summarizes our contractual obligations at December 31, 2011 and the effect that such obligations are expected to have on our liquidity and cash flows in future periods: Total Less than One Year One- Three Years Three- Five Years Thereafter (In thousands) Operating leases $ 120,090 $ 35,511 $ 46,652 $ 20,743 $ 17,184 Long-term debt 4,778,665 695,163 220,870 2,062,632 1,800,000 Scheduled interest payments 1,425,649 216,312 415,840 522,236 271,261 Other Commitments (1) 1,278,357 242,596 277,574 282,424 475,763 $ 7,602,761 $ 1,189,582 $ 960,936 $ 2,888,035 $ 2,564,208 (1) Other commitments include agreements to purchase third-party manufactured products and open purchase orders at December 31, 2011. The chart above does not include short-term borrowings held by Mylan Laboratories Limited in the amount of approximately $128.1 million, which represent working capital facilities with several banks, which are secured first by Mylan Laboratories Limited current assets and second by Mylan Laboratories Limited property, plant and equipment and has a weighted average interest rate of 5.4%. Additionally, due to the uncertainty with respect to the timing of future cash flows associated with our unrecognized tax benefits at December 31, 2011, we are unable to make reasonably reliable estimates of the period of cash settlement with the respective taxing authority. As such, $162.9 million of unrecognized tax benefits have been excluded from the contractual obligations table above. 64 Table of Contents We lease certain property under various operating lease arrangements that expire generally over the next five years. These leases generally provide us with the option to renew the lease at the end of the lease term. At December 31, 2011, the $937.2 million of debt related to the Cash Convertible Notes reported in our financial statements consists of $477.2 million of debt ($575.0 million face amount, net of $97.8 million discount) and a liability with a fair value of $460.0 million related to the bifurcated conversion feature. The bifurcated conversion feature is not included in contractual obligations as there is an offsetting hedge asset. Holders may convert their notes subject to certain conversion provisions including (i) during any quarter if the closing price of our common stock exceeds 130% of the respective conversion price per share during a defined period at the end of the previous quarter; (ii) during a defined period following five consecutive trading days in which the trading price per $1,000 principal amount was less than 98% of the product of the closing price of our common stock on such day and the applicable conversion reference rate; (iii) if we make specified distributions to holders of our common stock including sales of rights or common stock on a preferential basis, certain distribution of assets or other securities or rights to all holders of our common stock or certain transactions resulting in substantially all shares of our common stock being converted into cash, securities or other property; or (iv) upon a change of control or if our securities cease to be traded on a major U.S. stock exchange. The amount payable per $1,000 notional bond would be calculated as the product of (1) the conversion reference rate (currently 75.0751) and (2) the average Daily Volume Weighted Average Price per share of common stock for a specified period following the conversion date. Any payment above the principal amount is matched by a convertible note hedge. At December 31, 2011, the $594.0 million of debt related to the Senior Convertible Notes reported in our financial statements is net of a $6.0 million discount. Scheduled interest payments represent the estimated interest payments related to our outstanding borrowings under term loans, notes and other debt. Variable debt interest payments are estimated using current interest rates. We are contractually obligated to make potential future development, regulatory and commercial milestone, royalty and/or profit sharing payments in conjunction with collaborative agreements or acquisitions we have entered into with third parties. The most significant of these relates to the potential future consideration related to the Respiratory Delivery Platform. These payments are contingent upon the occurrence of certain future events and, given the nature of these events, it is unclear when, if ever, we may be required to pay such amounts. These contingent payments have not been included in the table above. The amount of contingent consideration accrued was $376.1 million at December 31, 2011. In addition, the Company expects to incur approximately $30-40 million of annual accretion expense related to the increase in the net present value of the contingent consideration liability. We have entered into an exclusive collaboration on the development, manufacturing, supply and commercialization of multiple, high value generic biologic compounds for the global marketplace. Mylan has committed to provide funding related to the collaboration over the next several years and amounts could be substantial. Additionally, we have entered into product development agreements under which we have agreed to share in the development costs as they are incurred by our partners. As the timing of cash expenditures is dependent upon a number of factors, many of which are outside of our control, it is difficult to forecast the amount of payments to be made over the next few years, which could be significant. We periodically enter into licensing agreements with other pharmaceutical companies for the manufacture, marketing and/or sale of pharmaceutical products. These agreements generally call for us to pay a percentage of amounts earned from the sale of the product as a royalty. Mylan sponsors various defined benefit pension plans in several countries. Benefit formulas are based on varying criteria on a plan by plan basis. We fund non-domestic pension liabilities in accordance with laws and regulations applicable to those plans, which typically results in these plans being unfunded. The amount accrued related to these benefits was $49.4 million at December 31, 2011. We are unable to determine when these amounts will require payment as the timing of cash expenditures is dependent upon a number of factors, many of which are outside of our control. 65 Table of Contents We have entered into employment and other agreements with certain executives and other employees that provide for compensation and certain other benefits. These agreements provide for severance payments under certain circumstances. Impact of Currency Fluctuations and Inflation Because Mylan results are reported in U.S. Dollars, changes in the rate of exchange between the U.S. Dollar and the local currencies in the markets in which Mylan operates, mainly the Euro, Australian Dollar, Indian Rupee, Japanese Yen, Canadian Dollar, and Pound Sterling, affect Mylan results as noted previously. Application of Critical Accounting Policies Our significant accounting policies are described in Note 2 to Consolidated Financial Statements and were prepared in accordance with accounting principles generally accepted in the United States of America ( GAAP ). Included within these policies are certain policies which contain critical accounting estimates and, therefore, have been deemed to be critical accounting policies. Critical accounting estimates are those which require management to make assumptions about matters that were uncertain at the time the estimate was made and for which the use of different estimates, which reasonably could have been used, or changes in the accounting estimates that are reasonably likely to occur from period to period could have a material impact on our financial condition or results of operations. We have identified the following to be our critical accounting policies: the determination of net revenue provisions, intangible assets, goodwill and contingent consideration, income taxes, and the impact of existing legal matters. Net Revenue Provisions Net revenues are recognized for product sales when title and risk of loss have transferred to the customer and when provisions for estimates, including discounts, sales allowances, price adjustments, returns, chargebacks and other promotional programs are reasonably determinable. Accruals for these provisions are presented in the Consolidated Financial Statements as reductions in determining net revenues and in accounts receivable and other current liabilities. Accounts receivable are presented net of allowances relating to these provisions, which were $763.0 million and $751.8 million at December 31, 2011 and 2010. Other current liabilities include $147.9 million and $167.0 million at December 31, 2011 and 2010, for certain sales allowances and other adjustments that are paid to indirect customers. The following is a rollforward of the most significant provisions for estimated sales allowances during 2011: Balance at 12/31/2010 Checks/ Credits Issued to Third Parties Current Provision Related to Sales Made in the Current Period Effects of Foreign Exchange Balance at 12/31/2011 (In thousands) Chargebacks $ 276,012 $ (2,162,291 ) $ 2,133,127 $ (175 ) $ 246,673 Incentives offered to direct customers $ 318,094 $ (1,239,540 ) $ 1,258,389 $ (2,234 ) $ 334,709 Returns $ 114,893 $ (162,945 ) $ 176,879 $ (194 ) $ 128,633 We do not anticipate any significant changes to the methodologies that we use to measure chargebacks, incentives offered to direct customers or returns; however, the balances within these reserves can fluctuate significantly through the consistent application of our methodologies. Historically, we have not recorded in any current period any material amounts related to adjustments made to prior period reserves. Should any material amounts from any prior period be recorded in any current period such amounts will be disclosed. 66 Table of Contents The reserve for chargebacks at December 31, 2010, included amounts related to products launched near year-end. The absence of similar reserves at December 31, 2011 is the reason for the overall decrease in this balance. The accruals for incentives offered to direct customers and for returns both increased in the current year mainly as a result of an increase in related sales. Provisions for estimated discounts, sales allowances, promotional and other credits require a lower degree of subjectivity and are less complex in nature, yet, combined, represent a significant portion of the overall provisions. These provisions are estimated based on historical payment experience, historical relationships to revenues, estimated customer inventory levels and contract terms. Such provisions are determinable due to the limited number of assumptions and consistency of historical experience. Others, such as chargebacks and returns, require management to make more subjective judgments and evaluate current market conditions. These provisions are discussed in further detail below. Chargebacks The provision for chargebacks is the most significant and complex estimate used in the recognition of revenue. Mylan markets products directly to wholesalers, distributors, retail pharmacy chains, mail order pharmacies and group purchasing organizations. We also market products indirectly to independent pharmacies, managed care organizations, hospitals, nursing homes and pharmacy benefit management companies, collectively referred to as indirect customers. Mylan enters into agreements with its indirect customers to establish contract pricing for certain products. The indirect customers then independently select a wholesaler from which to actually purchase the products at these contracted prices. Alternatively, certain wholesalers may enter into agreements with indirect customers that establish contract pricing for certain products, which the wholesalers provide. Under either arrangement, Mylan will provide credit to the wholesaler for any difference between the contracted price with the indirect party and the wholesaler invoice price. Such credit is called a chargeback, while the difference between the contracted price and the wholesaler invoice price is referred to as the chargeback rate. The provision for chargebacks is based on expected sell-through levels by our wholesaler customers to indirect customers, as well as estimated wholesaler inventory levels. For the latter, in most cases, inventory levels are obtained directly from certain of our largest wholesalers. Additionally, internal estimates are prepared based upon historical buying patterns and estimated end-user demand. Such information allows us to estimate the potential chargeback that we may ultimately owe to our customers given the quantity of inventory on hand. We continually monitor our provision for chargebacks and evaluate our reserve and estimates as additional information becomes available. A change of 5% in the estimated sell-through levels by our wholesaler customers and in the estimated wholesaler inventory levels would have an effect on our reserve balance of approximately $13 million. Returns Consistent with industry practice, we maintain a return policy that allows our customers to return product within a specified period prior to and subsequent to the expiration date. Although application of the policy varies from country to country in accordance with local practices, generally, product may be returned for a period beginning six months prior to its expiration date to up to one year after its expiration date. The majority of our product returns occurs as a result of product dating, which falls within the range set by our policy, and are settled through the issuance of a credit to our customer. Although the introduction of additional generic competition does not give our customers the right to return product outside of our established policy, we do recognize that such competition could ultimately lead to increased returns. We analyze this on a case-by-case basis, when significant, and make adjustments to increase our reserve for product returns as necessary. Our estimate of the provision for returns is based upon our historical experience with actual returns, which is applied to the level of sales for the period that corresponds to the period during which our customers may return product. This period is known by us based on the shelf lives of our products at the time of shipment. Additionally, we consider factors such as levels of inventory in the distribution channel, product dating and expiration period, size and maturity of the market prior to a product launch, entrance into the market of additional generic competition, changes in formularies or launch of over-the-counter products, and make adjustments to the provision for returns in the event that it appears that actual product returns may differ from our established reserves. We obtain data with respect to the level of inventory in the channel directly from certain of our largest customers. A change of 5% in the estimated product return rate used in our calculation of our return reserve would have an effect on our reserve balance of approximately $6 million. 67 Table of Contents Intangible Assets, Goodwill and Contingent Consideration We account for acquired businesses using the purchase method of accounting, which requires that the assets acquired and liabilities assumed be recorded at the date of acquisition at their respective estimated fair values. The cost to acquire a business has been allocated to the underlying net assets of the acquired business based on estimates of their respective fair values. For business acquisitions subsequent to 2009, amounts allocated to acquired in-process research and development ( IPR&D ) are capitalized at the date of acquisition. Intangible assets are amortized over the expected life of the asset. Any excess of the purchase price over the estimated fair values of the net assets acquired is recorded as goodwill. The judgments made in determining the estimated fair value assigned to each class of assets acquired and liabilities assumed, as well as asset lives, can materially impact our results of operations. Fair values and useful lives are determined based on, among other factors, the expected future period of benefit of the asset, the various characteristics of the asset and projected cash flows. Because this process involves management making estimates with respect to future sales volumes, pricing, new product launches, government reform actions, anticipated cost environment and overall market conditions, and because these estimates form the basis for the determination of whether or not an impairment charge should be recorded, these estimates are considered to be critical accounting estimates. We record contingent consideration resulting from a business combination at its fair value on the acquisition date. Each reporting period thereafter, we revalue these obligations and record increases or decreases in their fair value as an adjustment to contingent consideration expense within the Consolidated Statements of Operations. Changes in the fair value of the contingent consideration obligations can result from adjustments to the discount rates, payment periods and adjustments in the probability of achieving future development steps, regulatory approvals, market launches, sales targets and profitability. These fair value measurements represent Level 3 measurements as they are based on significant inputs not observable in the market. Significant judgment is employed in determining the assumptions utilized as of the acquisition date and for each subsequent measurement period. Accordingly, changes in assumptions described above, could have a material impact on our consolidated results of operations. Goodwill and intangible assets, including IPR&D, are reviewed for impairment annually and/or when events or other changes in circumstances indicate that the carrying amount of the assets may not be recoverable. Impairment of goodwill and indefinite-lived intangibles is determined to exist when the fair value is less than the carrying value of the net assets being tested. Impairment of definite-lived intangibles is determined to exist when undiscounted cash flows related to the assets are less than the carrying value of the assets being tested. Future events and decisions may lead to asset impairment and/or related costs. Goodwill is allocated among and evaluated for impairment at the reporting unit level, which is defined as an operating segment or one level below an operating segment. Mylan has four reporting units, of which three are included in the Generics segment with the remaining reporting unit consisting of our Specialty segment. As of the date of our most recent annual impairment test, April 1, 2011, approximately 90% of Mylan total goodwill is allocated to the three reporting units within the Generics segment as follows: North America ($810 million), EMEA ($1,229 million) and Asia Pacific ($1,295 million), with the remainder ($322 million) allocated to our Specialty segment and reporting unit. The first step of our annual impairment analysis consisted of a comparison of the estimated fair value of the individual reporting units with their carrying amount, including goodwill. In estimating each reporting unit fair value, we performed extensive valuation analyses, utilizing both income and market-based approaches, in our goodwill assessment process. We utilize an average of the two methods in estimating the fair value of the individual reporting units. The following describes the valuation methodologies used to derive the estimated fair value of the reporting units. 68 Table of Contents Income Approach : Under this approach to determine fair value, we discounted the expected future cash flows of each reporting unit. We used a discount rate, which reflected the overall level of inherent risk and the rate of return an outside investor would have expected to earn. To estimate cash flows beyond the final year of our model, we used a terminal value approach. Under this approach, we used estimated earnings before interest, taxes, depreciation and amortization ( EBITDA ) in the final year of our model, adjusted to estimate a normalized cash flow, applied a perpetuity growth assumption, and discounted by a perpetuity discount factor to determine the terminal value. We incorporated the present value of the resulting terminal value into our estimate of fair value. Market-Based Approach : The Company also utilizes a market-based approach to estimate fair value, principally utilizing the guideline company method which focuses on comparing our risk profile and growth prospects to a select group of publicly traded companies with reasonably similar guidelines. The Company performed its annual impairment test as of April 1, 2011, and the estimated fair value of three of the four reporting units was well in excess of the carrying value of these reporting units. For the Asia Pacific reporting unit, the estimated fair value of this business exceeded its carrying value by approximately 10%. The Asia Pacific reporting unit has been impacted by government pricing reform measures in Australia and Japan and increased levels of competition. As it relates to the income approach for the Asia Pacific unit, we forecasted cash flows for the next nine years. During the forecast period, the revenue compound annual growth rate ( CAGR ) was approximately 10%. A terminal value year was calculated with a 4% revenue growth rate. The CAGR in EBITDA margins was approximately 1% over the period of estimated cash flows. The discount rate utilized was 11.5%. Under the market-based approach, we utilized an estimated range of market multiples of 7.5 to 9.5 times EBITDA plus a control premium of 10%. The averaging of the two valuation methods did not significantly impact the estimated fair value of the Asia Pacific reporting unit. Due to declining actual and projected revenue and cash flows in the Asia Pacific and EMEA reporting units, the Company concluded that potential goodwill impairment indicators existed as of December 31, 2011. As a result, the Company performed an interim goodwill impairment analysis during the fourth quarter of 2011. As it relates to the income approach for the EMEA unit, we forecasted cash flows for the next ten years. During the forecast period, the revenue CAGR was approximately 4%. A terminal value year was calculated with a 3% revenue growth rate. The discount rate utilized was 9.0%. Under the market-based approach, we utilized an estimated range of market multiples of 8.0 to 9.5 times EBITDA plus a control premium of 15%. The estimated fair value of the EMEA reporting unit exceeded its carrying value by approximately 40%. The excess fair value of the EMEA reporting unit over its carrying value, however, declined by approximately 30% as compared to the results of the annual impairment test. As it relates to the Asia Pacific reporting unit, the significant assumptions utilized in the interim goodwill impairment test performed in the fourth quarter were consistent with the annual impairment test. The interim impairment test included updated projected operating results, and the discount rate utilized was 11.0%. Consistent with the results of the annual impairment test, the estimated fair value of this reporting unit exceeded its carrying value by approximately 10%. The determination of the fair value of the reporting units requires us to make significant estimates and assumptions that affect the reporting unit expected future cash flows. These estimates and assumptions primarily include, but are not limited to, market multiples, control premiums, the discount rate, terminal growth rates, operating income before depreciation and amortization, and capital expenditures forecasts. Due to the inherent uncertainty involved in making these estimates, actual results could differ from those estimates. In addition, changes in underlying assumptions, especially as it relates to the key assumptions detailed, could have a significant impact on the fair value of the reporting units. In the event the estimated fair value of a reporting unit is less than the carrying value, additional analysis would be required. The additional analysis would compare the carrying amount of the reporting unit goodwill 69 Table of Contents with the implied fair value of that goodwill. The implied fair value of goodwill is the excess of the fair value of the reporting unit over the fair value amounts assigned to all of the assets and liabilities of that unit as if the reporting unit was acquired in a business combination and the fair value of the reporting unit represented the purchase price. If the carrying value of goodwill exceeds its implied fair value, an impairment loss equal to such excess would be recognized, which would likely materially impact the Company reported results of operations. As a result of the interim goodwill impairment test performed for the Asia Pacific and EMEA reporting units, we have also assessed the recoverability of certain long-lived assets contained with these two reporting units. Any impairment of these assets must be considered prior to our impairment review of goodwill. The assessment for impairment is based on our ability to recover the carrying value of the long-lived assets by analyzing the expected future undiscounted pre-tax cash flows specific to the asset grouping. We assess the recoverability of the carrying value of long-lived assets at the lowest level for which identifiable undiscounted cash flows are largely independent of the cash flows of other assets and liabilities. For the Asia Pacific and EMEA reporting units, this assessment is generally performed at the country level within the reporting units. If these cash flows are less than the carrying value of long-lived assets within the asset group, an impairment loss is measured based on the difference between the estimated fair value and carrying value. Significant management judgment is involved in estimating the recoverability of these assets and is dependent upon the accuracy of the assumptions used in making these estimates, as well as how the estimates compare to the eventual future operating performance of the specific asset grouping. While the results of our analysis performed in the fourth quarter of 2011 indicate that the undiscounted pre-tax cash flows in the individual asset groupings were sufficient to support the recoverability of the long-lived assets, our operating units in Japan and Portugal remain at risk for potential impairment charges if projected operating results are not achieved. Any future long-lived assets impairment charges would likely materially impact the Company reported Results of Operations. Income Taxes We compute our income taxes based on the statutory tax rates and tax planning opportunities available to Mylan in the various jurisdictions in which we generate income. Significant judgment is required in determining our income taxes and in evaluating our tax positions. We establish reserves in accordance with Mylan policy regarding accounting for uncertainty in income taxes. Our policy provides that the tax effects from an uncertain tax position be recognized in Mylan financial statements, only if the position is more likely than not of being sustained upon audit, based on the technical merits of the position. We adjust these reserves in light of changing facts and circumstances, such as the settlement of a tax audit. Our provision for income taxes includes the impact of reserve provisions and changes to reserves. Favorable resolution would be recognized as a reduction to our provision for income taxes in the period of resolution. Management assesses the available positive and negative evidence to estimate if sufficient future taxable income will be generated to utilize the existing deferred tax assets. A significant piece of objective negative evidence evaluated was the cumulative loss incurred in certain taxing jurisdictions over the three-year period ended December 31, 2011. Such objective evidence limits the ability to consider other subjective evidence such as our projections for future growth. Based on this evaluation, as of December 31, 2011, a valuation allowance of $231.4 million has been recorded in order to measure only the portion of the deferred tax asset that more likely than not will be realized. The amount of the deferred tax asset considered realizable, however, could be adjusted if estimates of future taxable income during the carryforward period are reduced or if objective negative evidence in the form of cumulative losses is no longer present and additional weight may be given to subjective evidence such as projections for growth. The resolution of tax reserves and changes in valuation allowances could be material to Mylan results of operations or financial position. A variance of 5% between estimated reserves and valuation allowances and 70 Table of Contents actual resolution and realization of these tax items would have an effect on our reserve balance and valuation allowance of approximately $9 million and $12 million, respectively. Legal Matters Mylan is involved in various legal proceedings, some of which involve claims for substantial amounts. An estimate is made to accrue for a loss contingency relating to any of these legal proceedings if it is probable that a liability was incurred as of the date of the financial statements and the amount of loss can be reasonably estimated. Because of the subjective nature inherent in assessing the outcome of litigation and because of the potential that an adverse outcome in a legal proceeding could have a material adverse effect on our financial position, results of operations, and our cash flow, such estimates are considered to be critical accounting estimates. A variance of 5% between estimated and recorded litigation reserves (excluding indemnified claims) and actual resolution of certain legal matters would have an effect on our litigation reserve balance of approximately $10 million. Recent Accounting Pronouncements In June and December 2011, the Financial Accounting Standards Board issued revised accounting guidance for the presentation of comprehensive income. Under this guidance, an entity has the option to present the total of comprehensive income, the components of net income, and the components of other comprehensive income either in a single continuous statement of comprehensive income or in two separate but consecutive statements. The guidance eliminates the option to present the components of other comprehensive income as a part of the statement of changes in stockholders equity. The amended guidance is effective for fiscal years beginning after December 15, 2011, and it must be applied retrospectively. The guidance is not expected to have a material effect on our financial condition or results of operations, though it will change our financial statement presentation.
