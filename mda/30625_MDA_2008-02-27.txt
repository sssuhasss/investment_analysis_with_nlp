ITEM 7. MANAGEMENT S DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS OF FINANCIAL CONDITION AND RESULTS OF OPERATIONS The following discussion and analysis is provided to increase the understanding of, and should be read in conjunction with, the accompanying consolidated financial statements and notes. Please see Risk Factors and Forward-Looking Statements sections for a discussion of the risks, uncertainties and assumptions associated with these statements. Unless otherwise noted, all amounts discussed herein are consolidated. EXECUTIVE OVERVIEW We are an established industry leader with a strong product portfolio of pumps, valves, seals, automation and aftermarket services in support of global infrastructure industries including oil and gas, chemical, power generation and water management, as well as general industrial markets where our products add value. Our products are integral to the movement, control and protection of the flow of materials in our customers critical processes. Our business model is influenced by the capital spending of these industries for the placement of new products into service and aftermarket services for existing operations. The worldwide installed base of our products is an important source of aftermarket revenue, where products are expected to ensure the maximum operating time of many key industrial processes. The aftermarket business includes parts, service solutions, product life cycle solutions and other value added services, and is generally a higher margin business and a key component to our profitable growth. We have experienced favorable conditions in 2007 in all of our focus industries, especially oil and gas. Market pricing for crude oil and natural gas, in particular, has supported increased capital investment in the oil and gas market, resulting in many new projects and expansion opportunities. Favorable market conditions have resulted in corresponding growth, much of which is in the developing areas of the world where new oil and gas reserves are under development. We have seen a particular increase in investment in complex recovery reserves such as tar sands, deepwater and heavy oil where our products are well positioned. We believe the outlook for our business remains favorable; however, we believe that oil and gas prices will fluctuate in the future and such volatility could have a negative impact on our business in some or all of the geographical areas in which we conduct business. We continue to execute on our strategy to increase our presence in all regions of the global market to capture aftermarket business through the current installed base, as well as to secure new capital projects and process plant expansions. The opportunity to increase our installed base of new products and drive recurring aftermarket business in future years is a critical by-product of the favorable market conditions we have seen. Although we have experienced strong demand for our products and services in recent periods, we face challenges affecting many companies in our industry with a significant multinational presence, such as economic, political and other risks. We currently employ approximately 15,000 employees in more than 55 countries who are focused on key strategies that reach across the business. See Our Strategies section of this Management Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations ( MD&A ) for a discussion of our key strategies. We continue to build on our geographic breadth through the implementation of additional Quick Response Centers ( QRCs ) with the goal to be positioned as near to the customers as possible for service and support in order to capture this important aftermarket business. Along with ensuring that we have the local capability to sell, install and service our equipment in remote regions, it becomes equally imperative to continuously improve our global operations. Our global supply chain capability is being expanded to meet global customer demands and ensure the quality and timely delivery of our products. Significant efforts are underway to reduce the supply base and drive processes across our divisions to find areas of synergy and cost reduction. In addition, we are improving our supply chain management capability to ensure it can meet global customer demands. We continue to focus on improving on-time delivery and quality, while reducing warranty costs as a percentage of sales across our global operations through a focused Continuous Improvement Process ( CIP ) initiative. The goal of the CIP and lean manufacturing initiatives are to maximize service fulfillment to customers through on-time delivery, reduced cycle time and quality at the highest internal productivity. This program is a key factor in our margin expansion plans. RECENT DEVELOPMENTS As discussed in Note 13 to our consolidated financial statements included in this Annual Report on Form 10-K for the year ended December 31, 2007 ( Annual Report ), a number of putative class action lawsuits were filed against us, certain of our former officers, our independent auditors and the lead underwriters of our most recent 27 Table of Contents public stock offerings, alleging securities laws violations. By Orders dated November 13, 2007 and January 4, 2008, the trial court granted summary judgment in favor of us and all other defendants on all of the plaintiffs claims. The trial court also denied the plaintiffs request for class certification. We strongly believe that any appeal or other effort by the plaintiffs to overturn the trial court denial of class certification or entry of judgment would be without merit, and intend to oppose any such effort vigorously. Additionally, on January 2, 2008, the court entered an order granting our motion to dismiss all claims under a related shareholder derivative lawsuit that was originally filed on March 14, 2006 and allowed the plaintiffs an opportunity to replead. A notice of entry of the dismissal order was served on the plaintiffs on January 15, 2008. We have resolved investigations by the Securities and Exchange Commission ( SEC ) and the Department of Justice ( DOJ ) relating to products that two of our foreign subsidiaries delivered to Iraq from 1996 through 2003 under the United Nations Oil-for-Food Program. We negotiated a settlement with the SEC in which, without admitting or denying the SEC allegations, we agreed to (i) a stipulated judgment enjoining us from future violations of the internal control and recordkeeping provisions of the federal securities laws, (ii) pay disgorgement of $2,720,861 plus prejudgment interest of $853,364 and (iii) pay a civil money penalty of $3 million. Separately, we negotiated a resolution with DOJ. The resolution results in a deferred prosecution agreement under which we will pay a monetary penalty of $4,000,000. BUSINESS OVERVIEW Our Company We believe that we are a world-leading manufacturer and aftermarket service provider of comprehensive flow control systems. We develop and manufacture precision-engineered flow control equipment such as pumps, valves and seals, for critical service applications that require high reliability. We use our manufacturing platform to offer a broad array of aftermarket equipment services such as installation, advanced diagnostics, repair and retrofitting. Operations are conducted through three business segments that are referenced throughout this MD&A: Flowserve Pump Division ( FPD ): engineered and industrial pumps, pump systems, submersible motors and related services; Flow Control Division ( FCD ): engineered and industrial valves, control valves, actuators, controls and related services; and Flow Solutions Division ( FSD ): mechanical seals, auxiliary systems and parts and related services. Our product portfolio is built on more than 50 well-respected brand names such as Worthington, IDP, Valtek, Limitorque, and Durametallic. This portfolio is believed to be one of the most comprehensive in the industry. The products and services are sold either directly or through designated channels to more than 10,000 companies, including some of the world leading engineering and construction firms, original equipment manufacturers, distributors and end users. Our Markets Our products and services are used in several distinct industries: oil and gas, chemical, power generation and water management, as well as a number of other industries that are collectively refer to as general industries . Demand for most of our products depends on the level of new capital investment and planned maintenance expenditures by our customers. The level of capital expenditures depends, in turn, on capital infrastructure projects driven by the need for oil and gas, power and water, as well as general economic conditions. These are related to the phase of the cycle in their industries and the expectations of future market behavior. The levels of maintenance spend are driven by the reliability of the equipment, planned downtime for maintenance and the required capacity utilization of the process. The oil and gas industry represented approximately 41% and 43% of our bookings in 2007 and 2006, respectively. High petroleum prices generally drove additional investment in upstream (exploration and production) petroleum projects and significantly contributed to the increase in bookings. Many of these projects were in Asia, Africa, the Middle East and Latin America and reflect opportunities with national, international and other major oil companies. Based on the current and future expectations of oil and gas price levels as compared with historical 28 Table of Contents levels, oil and gas companies are encouraged to evaluate new resources and technologies and explore different options such as oil sands, deepwater, heavy oil and the Arctic region. In the downstream segment of the industry (refining and transportation), we experienced increased investment in 2007 due to a greater global demand for larger amounts of refined products stimulated by the rapid economic growth in developing countries and general demand growth in the rest of the world. The available refining capacity is not adequate to meet the current demand growth forecasts for the developing markets like China and India. The refineries are additionally pressured by new clean fuel regulations, which result in activities such as revamps and upgrades to address these environmental concerns. These situations have been positive for our products as oil and gas companies try to address the supply to the market with increased capacity and the right quality of products to meet tightening regulations. The outlook for this segment of the oil and gas industry is heavily dependent on the demand growth from the developing geographies. The chemical industry represented approximately 17% and 15% of our bookings in 2007 and 2006, respectively. Even with the increase in oil feedstock, this industry has been able to pass along price increases for their products, allowing profitability among major chemical companies to maintain levels supportive of capital investment. In the North American market, the weakness of the dollar has provided a platform of global competitiveness for domestically based chemical companies. This demand has driven increased capital investments to upgrade facilities and expand output capacity. The investment in new manufacturing facilities in China has also contributed to the growth in this industry. Although the global chemical industry is in a more mature phase of its cycle, output growth predictions provided by independent third parties for 2008 are modestly higher than for 2007. As for the emerging field of biotechnologies, we are seeing increased investments for pilot operations and research to bring these alternative products to market. We are currently working with key customers in this area in the development of products to serve this future industry. The outlook for the chemical industry remains favorable on a global scale; however, regional economic slowdowns and exchange rate changes could have an adverse impact on this industry in the respective markets. The power industry represented approximately 12% and 13% of our bookings in 2007 and 2006, respectively. This industry continued to see capital investment growth due the increased power demands in the developing countries such as China and India and capacity increases in mature markets including the United States ( U.S. ). Many of the projects in 2007 were designed as coal-fired power plants due to the increasing costs of natural gas and the long lead time for clean-coal and nuclear. The revenue opportunity from sales of our products at a coal-fired plant typically can be three times that of a natural gas power plant. Planned investments in nuclear power generators increased over the past year with a significant increase in proposed power plant projects. In the U.S., more than 30 submittals to the Nuclear Regulatory Commission are expected for new nuclear power plants. China is projected to develop projects to bring on line as many as two nuclear plants per year for the next 20 years, according to government sources. Our product offerings have maintained N-stamp certification (required for nuclear applications) through the slowdown in nuclear power plant construction allowing us to continue to support the aftermarket business for existing facilities. This positions us well for the pending growth in investment in nuclear globally. We are seeing increased activity in alternative energy sources such as geothermal and coal gasification where we are working with key customers in the development of products to serve this portion of the power industry. The outlook for the power industry is favorable due to the increasing power demand in the developing countries and infrastructure improvements needed in the mature markets. However, economic slowdowns or recessions could delay the demand for additional power pushing major capital projects out into the future. Worldwide demand for fresh water and water treatment continues to create requirements for new facilities or for upgrades of existing systems, many of which require products that we offer, especially pumps. We believe we are a global leader in the desalination market, which is an important source of fresh water in the Mediterranean area and the Middle East. We expect that this trend in desalination will expand from the traditional areas, as previously mentioned, to other coastal areas around the globe. This is a significant market for pump and valve actuation products. In both 2007 and 2006, the water market represented approximately 6% of our bookings. General industries comprises a variety of different businesses, including mining and ore processing, pulp and paper, food and beverage and other smaller applications, none of which individually represents more than 5% of total bookings in 2007 and 2006. General industries also includes sales to distributors, whose end customers operate 29 Table of Contents in the industries we primarily serve. General industries represented approximately 24% and 23% of our bookings in 2007 and 2006, respectively. In 2007, we saw favorable growth in these businesses with the mining and ore processing industry showing increased investment. This portion of our business tends to have stable performance due to the diversity of industries and their respective different business cycles. Our customers include engineering contractors, original equipment manufacturers, end users and distributors. Sales to engineering contractors and original equipment manufacturers are typically for large project orders and critical applications, as are certain sales to distributors. Project orders are typically procured for customers either directly from us or indirectly through contractors for new construction projects or facility enhancement projects. The quick turnaround business, which we also refer to as the book and ship business, is defined as orders that are received from the customer (booked) and shipped within three months of receipt. These orders are typically for more standard products, parts or services. Each of our three business segments generates certain levels of this type of business. In the sale of aftermarket products and services, we benefit from a large installed base of our pumps, seals and valves, which require maintenance, repair and replacement parts. We use our manufacturing platform to offer a broad array of aftermarket equipment services such as installation, advanced diagnostics, repair and retrofitting. In geographic regions where we are positioned to provide quick response, we believe customers have traditionally relied on us, rather than our competitors, for aftermarket products due to our highly engineered and customized products. However, the aftermarket for standard products is competitive with common standards providing easier replacement of the installed products. Proximity of service centers, timeliness of delivery and quality are important considerations for aftermarket products and services. Therefore we continue to expand our global QRC network to improve our ability to capture this important aftermarket business. The reporting of trends by product type, customer type and business type is based upon analytical review of individual operational results and knowledge of their respective businesses, as we do not formally track revenues by any of these categories. These trends are analyzed as a secondary reporting mechanism that is not derived directly from our general ledger system. Our Strategies Our overarching objective is to grow our position as a product and integrated solutions provider in the flow control industry. This objective includes continuing to sell products by building on existing sales relationships and marketing the power of our portfolio of products and services. It also includes delivering specific end-user solutions that help customers attain their business goals by ensuring maximum reliability at a decreased cost of ownership. Sustainable, profitable growth is being driven using strategies that are well communicated throughout our company. These strategies include: organic growth, globalization, process excellence, portfolio management and strategic acquisitions, organizational capability and technology/innovation. The key elements of these strategies are outlined below. Organic Growth Organic growth is an important initiative focused on growing revenues from the existing portfolio of products and services, as well as through the development of new customer-driven products and services. An overarching goal is to focus on opportunities that can maximize the organic growth from existing customers and to evaluate potential new customer-partnering initiatives that maximize the capture of the product total life cycle. We are one of the few pump, valve and seal companies that can offer customers a differentiated option of products and services, as well as offer an additional option that includes any combination of products and solution support packages across a broad portfolio. The combined pump and seal end-user teams have historically been successful in delivering new solution programs and increasing organic aftermarket growth. We seek to capture additional market share by creating mutually beneficial opportunities for us and our customers through sourcing and maintenance alliance programs pursuant to which we provide all or an agreed portion of customers parts and servicing needs. These customer alliances enable us to develop long-term professional relationships with our customers and serve as an effective platform for introducing new products and services to our customers and generating additional sales. 30 Table of Contents We also seek to continue to review our substantial installed pump, seal and valve base as a means to expand the aftermarket services business, as customers are increasingly using third-party aftermarket service providers to reduce their fixed costs and improve profitability. To date, the aftermarket services business has provided us with a steady source of revenues and cash flows at higher margins than original equipment sales. This allows us to be in frequent contact with customers, building on the knowledge of customer needs and providing cross-selling opportunities. We are building on our established presence through an extensive QRC global network to provide the immediate parts, service and technical support required to effectively manage and win the aftermarket business created from our installed base. New product and service development is driven through our product management organization, working in concert with engineering, operations and sales. The goal is to increase our revenues from new products and services developed during the last five years. The new product development process has made significant progress in demonstrating a pipeline of new and modified products and services. Globalization The globalization business initiative has several facets that include: expanding our global presence to capture business in the developing geographic market areas (China, Russia, Latin America, Middle East and Africa); utilizing low-cost sourcing opportunities to remain competitive in the global economy; and attracting and retaining the global intellectual capital required to support our global growth plans in new geographical areas. We believe there are attractive opportunities in international markets, particularly in Latin America, the Middle East and Asia-Pacific and intend to continue to utilize our global presence to further penetrate these markets. In 2007, we signed a joint venture agreement with Changsha Pump Works in China to focus on the growing power and water industries in China. In the aftermarket services business, we seek to strategically add QRCs sites in order to provide rapid response, fast delivery and onsite field repair on a global scale for our customers. In 2007, we added four QRCs expanding our ability to effectively deliver aftermarket support globally. Of particular note, we broke ground on a new QRC campus in Dubai located in the Jebel Ali Free Trade Zone. This facility will support aftermarket requirements for all three product divisions in the Middle East region. We are focused on shifting, as appropriate, certain manufacturing and engineering functions to, and increasing the supply of materials and components from, lower cost areas such as India, China, Mexico, Latin America and Eastern Europe. In 2007 these areas accounted for approximately 15% of our direct materials spending, compared to approximately 5% in 2001. We are focused on utilizing supply chain management to reduce procurement costs, including expanding purchases utilizing e-Commerce and further consolidating the procurement of goods at a better value. In addition, we have expanded our China presence with additional sales and supply chain professionals and growth plans. These growth plans include acquisition or development of new capabilities that will enhance the penetration of products in China for oil and gas and power projects, as well as provide a base for the export of products. Process Excellence The process excellence initiative encapsulates ongoing programs that drive increased customer fulfillment and yield internal productivity. This initiative includes: driving improved customer fulfillment through metrics such as on-time delivery, cost reduction, quality, cycle time reduction and warranty cost reduction as a percentage of sales; continuing to develop a culture of continuous improvement that delivers maximum productivity and cost efficiencies; and implementing global functional competencies to drive standardized processes. 31 Table of Contents We seek to increase our operational efficiency through our CIP initiative, which utilizes tools such as Six Sigma methodology, lean manufacturing and capacity management to improve quality and processes, reduce product cycle times and lower costs. Recognizing that employees are our most valuable resource in achieving operational excellence goals, we have instituted broad CIP training. To date, more than 1,300 employees are CIP-trained or certified as Green Belts or Black Belts and are deployed on CIP projects throughout our company in operations and the front office of the business. As a result of the CIP initiatives, we have developed and implemented processes to reduce our engineering and manufacturing process cycle time, improve on-time delivery and service response time, lower inventory levels and reduce costs. We have also experienced success in sharing and applying best practices achieved in one business segment and deploying those ideas to other segments of the business. We continue to make progress in standardizing processes and simplifying our information technology platform. Standard processes have been designed and agreed to by our Manufacturing, Supply Chain, Sales and Service and Finance departments, creating a standard blueprint for our company. We continue to implement these processes using a common enterprise resource planning ( ERP ) software platform. Since 2004, we have successfully reduced our overall ERP footprint from 59 platforms to 37 platforms (excluding the impact of platform reductions resulting from dispositions). We seek to continue to improve our working capital utilization, with a particular focus on improving the management of accounts receivable and inventory. See further discussion in the Liquidity and Capital Resources section of this MD&A. Portfolio Management and Strategic Acquisitions The continued management of our portfolio of products and services is critical to our success. We will continue to rationalize our portfolio of products and services to ensure alignment with market requirements. We will continue to make the necessary research and development ( R&D ) investments to expand the scope of our product offerings and our deployment of advanced technologies. We will also continue to evaluate acquisitions, joint ventures and other strategic investment opportunities to broaden our product portfolio, service capabilities, geographic presence or operational capabilities to meet the growing needs of our customers. In 2007, we sold non-core assets related to the rail business of our wholly-owned Australian subsidiary, Thompsons, Kelly and Lewis, Pty. Ltd. ( TKL ). The TKL rail assets were a part of our larger Australian pump business. The TKL pump business was retained and remains a core part of our business. Organizational Capability We believe there are several elements in our strategic efforts to continuously enhance our organizational capability, including: building our succession planning along with our competency and performance management capabilities, with a focus on key positions and critical talent pools; utilizing these capabilities to drive our training programs and facilitate our cross-divisional and functional development assignments; developing talent acquisition programs to address critical talent needs to support our global growth; capturing the intellectual capital in the current workforce and sharing it within our company and with customers as a competitive advantage; creating a total compensation program that provides our associates with equitable opportunities that are competitive and linked to performance; and building a diversified organization with a strong ethical and compliance culture based on transparency and trust. We continue to focus on training through the distribution of electronic learning packages in multiple languages for our Code of Business Conduct, workplace harassment, facility safety, anti-bribery and Foreign Corrupt Practices Act, export compliance and other regulatory and compliance programs. In addition, in 2006 we launched a new rotating equipment specialist program aimed at capturing internal intellectual capital and improving the capabilities of the internal workforce in an effort to provide better service to our customers. This is a comprehensive program 32 Table of Contents that will continue through 2007 and 2008 with the goal of educating more than 2,000 of our front line employees across the globe. Technology/Innovation The infusion of advanced technologies into new product and services development has become a core requirement as we evaluate our R&D investments. The objective is to improve the percentage of new products as a function of revenue, utilizing technological innovation to improve overall product lifecycle management and total cost of ownership for our customers. A cross-divisional technology council is in place to explore new technologies and their potential applications in our industry. The team also has the objective of ensuring that the technologies developed are available for wide use across our company to maximize the return on investments. One major focus of applying advanced technology is in adding self-diagnostic capabilities into our products. This includes the intelligence required to provide customers with advanced warning of required maintenance, allowing their operations to reach optimal productivity. We are teaming with universities and experts in the appropriate research fields to accelerate the required learning and to shorten the development time in leveraging the value of applied technologies in our products and services. Our intent is to be a market leader in the application of advanced technology to improve product performance and return on investment for our customers. OUR RESULTS OF OPERATIONS Bookings and Backlog 2007 2006 2005 (Amounts in millions) Bookings continuing operations $ 4,318.7 $ 3,617.0 $ 2,931.9 Bookings discontinued operations(1) 90.4 Total bookings 4,318.7 3,617.0 3,022.3 Backlog (at period end) 2,276.6 1,630.0 994.1 (1) Bookings for discontinued operations in 2005 represent certain non-core service operations, collectively called the General Services Group ( GSG ), which was previously included in FCD. GSG was sold effective December 31, 2005, and we treated this disposition as discontinued operations for the year then ended. We define a booking as the receipt of a customer order that contractually engages us to perform activities on behalf of our customer with regard to manufacture, service or support. Total bookings in 2007 increased by $701.7 million, or 19.4%, as compared with 2006. The increase includes currency benefits of approximately $208 million. Increased bookings are primarily attributable to strength in the oil and gas and chemical markets for all of our divisions. Additionally, the power industry continues to be strong for FPD and FCD, and the water and mining industries are contributing to the growth in FPD. Bookings for continuing operations in 2006 increased $685.1 million, or 23.4%, as compared with 2005. Total bookings in 2006 increased by $594.7 million, or 19.7%, as compared with 2005. The increase includes currency benefits of approximately $24 million. Total bookings in 2005 include $90.4 million of bookings for GSG, a discontinued operation that was sold effective December 31, 2005. Increased bookings are primarily attributable to strength in the oil and gas industry, which has positively impacted each of our divisions, particularly in North America and the Middle East. The power, chemical and water industries have also contributed to the improvement. Backlog represents the accumulation of uncompleted customer orders. Backlog of $2.3 billion at December 31, 2007 increased by $646.6 million, or 39.7%, as compared with 2006. Currency effects provided an increase of approximately $140 million. The increase in total bookings reflects an increase in project work and orders for engineered products, which naturally have longer lead times, as well as expanded lead times at the request of certain customers. By the end of 2008, we expect to ship over 88% of this backlog. Backlog of $1.6 billion at December 31, 2006 increased by $635.9 million, or 64.0%, as compared with 2005. Currency effects provided an increase of approximately $101 million. The increase resulted primarily from increased bookings as discussed above. 33 Table of Contents Sales 2007 2006 2005 (Amounts in millions) Sales $ 3,762.7 $ 3,061.1 $ 2,695.3 Sales in 2007 increased by $701.6 million, or 22.9%, as compared with 2006. The increase includes currency benefits of approximately $178 million. The increase is primarily attributable to continued strength in the oil and gas markets, which has positively impacted both original equipment and aftermarket sales for FPD. Additionally, FCD is experiencing strong project sales across all valve markets and FSD is experiencing increased aftermarket and project sales in Europe, the Middle East and Africa ( EMA ) and North America, respectively. In 2007, original equipment and aftermarket sales increased 27% and 18%, respectively, as compared with 2006. Sales in 2006 increased by $365.8 million, or 13.6%, as compared with 2005. The increase includes currency benefits of approximately $39 million. The increase in sales is primarily attributable to continued strength in the oil and gas industry, particularly in North America and the Middle East, which has significantly impacted FPD and FCD. FCD has also been positively impacted by strength in the process valve industry, particularly in Asia. Additional capacity has enabled FSD to increase its aftermarket sales. Sales to international customers, including export sales from the U.S., were approximately 66% of sales in 2007 compared with 67% of sales in 2006 and 65% of sales in 2005. Sales to EMA were approximately 38%, 42% and 39% in 2007, 2006 and 2005, respectively. Sales into the Asia Pacific region were approximately 16%, 15% and 14% in 2007, 2006 and 2005, respectively. We believe that our sales to international customers will increase as a percentage of total sales, as we believe our highest revenue growth opportunities are in Asia, the Middle East and Latin America. Gross Profit and Gross Profit Margin 2007 2006 2005 (Amounts in millions) Gross profit $ 1,247.7 $ 1,007.3 $ 870.6 Gross profit margin 33.2 % 32.9 % 32.3 % Gross profit in 2007 increased by $240.4 million, or 23.9%, as compared with 2006. Gross profit margin in 2007 of 33.2% increased from 32.9% in 2006. Gross profit margin in 2007 was positively impacted by higher sales, which favorably impacts our absorption of fixed manufacturing costs, as well as various CIP and supply chain initiatives. Our CIP initiative is driving increased throughput on existing capacity, reduced cycle time, lean manufacturing and reduced warranty costs as a percentage of sales. Our supply chain initiatives focus on materials costs savings through low cost supply sources, long-term supply agreements and product outsourcing. While both original equipment and aftermarket sales increased, the rate of growth of original equipment sales exceeded that of aftermarket sales. As a result, original equipment sales increased to 63% of total sales in 2007, as compared with 62% in 2006. The aftermarket business consistently provides more favorable gross profit margins than original equipment sales. Gross profit in 2006 increased by $136.7 million, or 15.7%, as compared with 2005. Gross profit margin in 2006 of 32.9% increased from 32.3% in 2005. Gross profit margin in 2006 was positively impacted by various CIP and supply chain initiatives. Gross profit margin in 2006 was also positively impacted by pricing increases in FCD and FSD, as well as increased sales in all of our divisions, which positively impacts our absorption of fixed costs. These were partially offset by an increase in original equipment sales, primarily by FPD, which generally carries a lower margin. Selling, General and Administrative Expense ( SG&A ) 2007 2006 2005 (Amounts in millions) SG&A expense $ 856.5 $ 782.5 $ 684.3 SG&A expense as a percentage of sales 22.8 % 25.6 % 25.4 % SG&A is impacted by growth in our underlying business, various initiatives to improve organizational capability, compliance and systems and infrastructure improvements. In each of the three years presented, at least 34 Table of Contents 53% of SG&A consisted of employee-related costs, which includes payroll, benefits and incentive payments. SG&A in 2007 increased by $74.0 million, or 9.5%, as compared with 2006. Currency effects provided an increase of approximately $29 million. The increase in SG&A is primarily attributable to an increase in employee-related costs of $62.8 million due to continued investment in sales and engineering personnel and other in-house capabilities to drive long-term growth, as well as annual merit increases, equity compensation arising from improved performance and a higher stock price and annual and long-term incentive compensation plans, as well as a $7.3 million increase in third party commissions, in support of increased bookings and sales. This was partially offset by a $5.9 million pre-tax gain recorded by FPD on the sale of our TKL rail assets. A decrease of $12.1 million in audit fees was partially offset by an increase of $5.2 million in professional fees related to R&D. Legal fees and accrued resolution costs to governmental authorities related to our foreign subsidiaries involvement with the United Nations Oil-for-Food Program of approximately $11 million were partially offset by net gains from certain legal matters. For additional discussion of legal matters, see the Recent Developments section of this MD&A and Note 13 to our consolidated financial statements included in this Annual Report. SG&A as a percentage of sales in 2007 improved 280 basis points as compared with the same period in 2006. The decrease is primarily attributable to leverage from higher sales and the gain on the sale of our TKL rail assets, as well as ongoing efforts to contain costs and the stock modification and realignment charges recorded in 2006 that did not recur. SG&A in 2006 increased by $98.2 million, or 14.4%, as compared with 2005. Currency effects provided an increase of approximately $6 million. The increase is primarily attributable to an increase in employee-related costs of $54.0 million as follows: development of in-house capabilities for tax, Sarbanes-Oxley compliance, internal audit, and financial planning and analysis; increased marketing and engineering personnel to support increased sales; increased equity incentive arising from higher share price ($6.5 million primarily related to restricted stock) and the adoption of Statement of Financial Accounting Standards ( SFAS ) No. 123(R), Share-Based Payment ($6.9 million related to stock options); costs associated with our expansion in Asia; and severance charges related to an outsourcing initiative ($1.3 million). The increase is also due to an increase in travel expenses of $12.1 million, due to increased global selling and marketing activity to support overall business growth and increased compliance initiatives, an $8.0 million increase in information technology expenses related to infrastructure and ERP application upgrades and a $11.4 million increase in legal fees and expenses, partially offset by a $12.6 million decrease in finance-related professional fees due to the development of in-house capabilities discussed above. Additionally, we incurred charges of $11.6 million associated with the relocation of product lines to different facilities and the severance of redundant personnel in Europe, which accounts for 40 basis points of our SG&A as a percentage of sales. Net Earnings from Affiliates 2007 2006 2005 (Amounts in millions) Net earnings from affiliates $ 18.7 $ 14.8 $ 12.5 Net earnings from affiliates represents our joint venture interests in Asia and the Middle East. Net earnings from affiliates in 2007 increased by $3.9 million as compared with 2006. The improvement in earnings is primarily attributable to an FCD joint venture in India and an FPD joint venture in Japan. Net earnings from affiliates in 2006 increased by $2.3 million as compared with 2005. The improvement in earnings is primarily attributable to an FSD joint venture in Korea and an FPD joint venture in Japan. Operating Income 2007 2006 2005 (Amounts in millions) Operating income $ 409.9 $ 239.6 $ 198.8 Operating income as a percentage of sales 10.9 % 7.8 % 7.4 % Operating income in 2007 increased by $170.3 million, or 71.1%, as compared with 2006. The increase includes currency benefits of approximately $32 million. The increase is primarily a result of the $240.4 million increase in gross profit, partially offset by the $74.0 million increase in SG&A, discussed above. 35 Table of Contents Operating income in 2006 increased by $40.8 million, or 20.5%, as compared with 2005. The increase includes currency benefits of approximately $6 million. The increase is primarily a result of the $136.7 million increase in gross profit, partially offset by the $98.2 million increase in SG&A, discussed above. Interest Expense, Interest Income and Loss on Early Extinguishment of Debt 2007 2006 2005 (Amounts in millions) Interest expense $ (60.1 ) $ (65.7 ) $ (74.1 ) Interest income 4.3 7.6 3.4 Loss on early extinguishment of debt (0.4 ) (0.7 ) (27.7 ) Interest expense in 2007 decreased by $5.6 million as compared with 2006, primarily as a result of lower average outstanding debt. Interest expense decreased by $8.4 million in 2006 as compared with 2005, as a result of the refinancing of our 12.25% Senior Subordinated Notes in August 2005 with the proceeds of borrowings under our Credit Facilities. See further discussion of our refinancing in Note 11 to our consolidated financial statements included in this Annual Report. At December 31, 2007 approximately 71% of our debt was at fixed rates, including the effects of $395.0 million of notional interest rate swaps. Interest income in 2007 decreased by $3.3 million as compared with 2006 due primarily to a lower average cash balance. Interest income in 2006 increased by $4.2 million as compared with 2005 due to significantly higher average cash balances. During 2007, we incurred charges of $0.4 million as a result of an amendment to our Credit Facilities in August 2007, which improved the terms of our revolving line of credit. See further discussion of our amendment in the Liquidity and Capital Resources section of this MD&A and in Note 11 to our consolidated financial statements included in this Annual Report. During 2006, we incurred charges of $0.7 million on debt repayments and extinguishment primarily as a result of our repayments of amounts outstanding under our European Investment Bank ( EIB ) credit facility. During 2005, we incurred a charge of $27.7 million as a result of debt repayments and extinguishment related to our 2005 refinancing. Other Income (Expense), net 2007 2006 2005 (Amounts in millions) Other income (expense), net $ 6.4 $ 6.4 $ (8.4 ) Other income (expense), net in 2007 did not change compared with 2006. During 2007, the U.S. dollar exchange rate weakened versus the Euro. Other income (expense), net in 2006 increased by $14.8 million to income of $6.4 million as compared with 2005, primarily due to a $14.2 million increase in unrealized gains on forward exchange contracts, due in part to a $3.3 million gain on the settlement of the derivative contract related to our EIB credit facility. Tax Expense and Tax Rate 2007 2006 2005 (Amounts in millions) Provision for income taxes $ 104.3 $ 73.2 $ 40.6 Effective tax rate 29.0 % 39.1 % 44.1 % The 2007 effective tax rate differed from the federal statutory rate of 35% primarily due to the net impact of foreign operations, which includes the impacts of lower foreign tax rates and the net favorable results from various tax audits, and changes in valuation allowance estimates. These improvements were partially offset by additional reserves established for uncertain tax positions pursuant to our adoption of Financial Accounting Standards Board ( FASB ) Financial Interpretation ( FIN ) No. 48, Accounting for Uncertainty in Income Taxes an Interpretation of FASB Statement No. 109. See additional discussion of uncertain tax positions in Note 11 to our consolidated financial statements included in this Annual Report. The 2006 effective tax rate differed from the federal statutory rate of 35% primarily due to the net impact of foreign operations and certain U.S. non-deductible expenses. 36 Table of Contents The 2005 effective tax rate differed from the federal statutory rate of 35% primarily due to Extraterritorial Income ( ETI ) exclusion benefits of $1.9 million, state income tax benefits of $1.7 million resulting primarily from net reductions in valuation allowances and $11.5 million of net tax impact from foreign operations. We have operations in European and Asian countries that provide various tax incentives. In 2003, we were granted a preferential tax rate of approximately 10% in Switzerland for certain sales and marketing activities. This incentive did not provide a benefit after 2006. During 2004, we received a 5-year, 10% tax rate in Singapore for income in excess of a prescribed base amount generated from certain regional headquarter activities, subject to certain employment and investment requirements. In India, we were granted 100% tax exemptions for profits derived from export sales and certain manufacturing operations in prescribed areas for a period of 10 years. The Indian tax exemptions expire in 2011 and 2007, respectively. On May 17, 2006, the Tax Increase Prevention and Reconciliation Act of 2005 was signed into law, creating an exclusion from U.S. taxable income for certain types of foreign related party payments of dividends, interest, rents, and royalties which, prior to 2006, have been subject to U.S. taxation. This exclusion is effective for the years 2006 through 2008, and applies to certain of our related party payments. Our effective tax rate is based upon current earnings and estimates of future taxable earnings for each domestic and international location. Changes in any of these and other factors, including our ability to utilize foreign tax credits and net operating losses or results from tax audits, could impact the tax rate in future periods. As of December 31, 2007 we have foreign tax credits of $16.6 million, expiring in 2010 through 2016 against which we recorded $0.3 million in valuation allowances. Additionally, we have recorded other U.S. net deferred tax assets of $61.8 million, which relate to net operating losses, tax credits and other deductible temporary differences that are available to reduce taxable income in future periods, most of which do not have a definite expiration. Should we not be able to utilize all or a portion of these credits and losses, our effective tax rate would be negatively impacted. It is reasonably possible that within the next 12 months the effective tax rate will be impacted by the resolution of some or all of the matters audited by various taxing authorities. We estimate we could record a reduction in our tax expense of approximately $17 million to $32 million within the next 12 months. Net Earnings and Earnings Per Share 2007 2006 2005 (Amounts in millions) Income from continuing operations $ 255.8 $ 114.0 $ 51.4 Net earnings(1) 255.8 115.0 17.1 Net earnings per share from continuing operations diluted 4.46 2.00 0.91 Net earnings per share diluted 4.46 2.02 0.30 Average diluted shares 57.3 56.9 56.7 (1) Net earnings in 2006 includes a gain of $1.0 million from discontinued operations, representing the reduction in the loss on the sale of GSG as a result of the resolution of the contingent sales price. Net earnings in 2005 includes a $31.8 million loss from discontinued operations, net of tax, is due primarily to the impairment of certain assets owned by GSG, which is more fully discussed in Note 2 to our consolidated financial statements included in this Annual Report. Income from continuing operations in 2007 increased by $141.8 million to $255.8 million, or $4.46 per diluted share, as compared with 2006. The increase is primarily attributable to the $170.3 million increase in operating income, partially offset by the $31.1 million increase in tax expense, as discussed above. Income from continuing operations in 2006 increased by $62.6 million to $114.0 million, or $2.00 per diluted share, as compared with 2005. The increase is primarily attributable to the $40.8 million increase in operating income and the $27.0 million decrease in loss on debt repayment and extinguishment, partially offset by the $32.6 million increase in tax expense, as discussed above. 37 Table of Contents Other Comprehensive Income (Expense) 2007 2006 2005 (Amounts in millions) Other comprehensive income (expense) $ 69.0 $ 63.5 $ (63.7 ) Other comprehensive income (expense) in 2007 increased by $5.5 million to income of $69.0 million as compared with 2006. This was primarily due to the continued weakening of the U.S. dollar exchange rate versus the Euro during 2007. An increase in pension and other postretirement income, due primarily to an increased discount rate, was mostly offset by a decline in results from interest rate hedging activity. Other comprehensive income (expense) in 2006 increased by $127.2 million to income of $63.5 million as compared with 2005. The increase is due primarily to the weakening of the U.S. dollar exchange rate versus the Euro and the British pound during 2006. Pension and other postretirement income of $23.9 million in 2006 increased from expense of $31.9 million in 2005, primarily as a result of an increased discount rate. Business Segments We conduct our business through three business segments that represent our major product areas. We evaluate segment performance and allocate resources based on each segment operating income. See Note 17 to our consolidated financial statements included in this Annual Report for further discussion of our segments. The key operating results for our three business segments, FPD, FCD and FSD are discussed below. Flowserve Pump Division Segment Results Through FPD, we design, manufacture, distribute and service engineered and industrial pumps and pump systems and submersible motors (collectively referred to as original equipment or OE ). FPD also manufactures replacement parts and related equipment, and provides a full array of support services (collectively referred to as aftermarket ). FPD has 28 manufacturing facilities worldwide, of which eight are located in North America, 11 in Europe, four in Latin America and five in Asia. FPD also has 76 service centers, including those co-located in a manufacturing facility, in 24 countries. We believe that we are the largest pump manufacturer serving the oil and gas, chemical and power generation industries, and the third largest pump manufacturer overall. Flowserve Pump Division 2007 2006 2005 (Amounts in millions) Bookings $ 2,551.4 $ 2,110.9 $ 1,575.7 Sales 2,095.4 1,617.7 1,398.4 Gross profit 596.6 457.4 395.8 Gross profit margin 28.5 % 28.3 % 28.3 % Segment operating income 274.2 172.7 149.8 Segment operating income as a percentage of sales 13.1 % 10.7 % 10.7 % Backlog (at period end) 1,775.3 1,263.3 703.5 Bookings in 2007 increased by $440.5 million, or 20.9%, as compared with 2006. The increase includes currency benefits of approximately $133 million. The increase is attributable to EMA, North America and Latin America, which increased $262.2 million (including currency benefits of approximately $111 million), $106.7 million and $59.6 million (including currency benefits of approximately $5 million), respectively. The highest rates of growth occurred in EMA and Latin America. Both original equipment and aftermarket bookings continue to be strong, increasing 25% and 14%, respectively, as compared with 2006. Increased bookings were led by continued strength in oil and gas, chemical, water and general industry markets. Of the $2.6 billion of total bookings in 2007, approximately 51% were from oil and gas, 15% power, 10% water, 8% chemical and 16% general industries. Bookings in 2006 increased by $535.2 million, or 34.0%, as compared with 2005. The increase includes currency benefits of approximately $15 million. The increase is primarily due to an increase in EMA of $360.1 million (including currency benefits of approximately $13 million), which is attributable to strength in the oil and gas, power and water industries and an increase of $131.1 million in North America, which is primarily attributable to the oil and gas industry. The increase in bookings includes a 46% increase in original equipment bookings, attributable to all regions, and an 18% increase in aftermarket bookings, particularly in EMA. Of the 38 Table of Contents $2.1 billion of total bookings in 2006, approximately 54% were from oil and gas, 16% power, 9% water, 6% chemical and 15% general industries. Sales in 2007 increased by $477.7 million, or 29.5%, as compared with 2006. The increase includes currency benefits of approximately $108 million. The increase is primarily attributable to EMA, North America and Latin America, which increased $300.7 million (including currency benefits of approximately $88 million), $129.5 million and $51.3 million (including currency benefits of approximately $5 million), respectively. The highest rate of growth occurred in Latin America. Both original equipment and aftermarket sales show continued strength, increasing 38% and 21%, respectively, as compared with the same period in 2006. The increases in EMA and North America are due to strength in the oil and gas industry. Sales in 2006 increased by $219.3 million, or 15.7%, as compared with 2005. The increase includes currency benefits of approximately $24 million. The increase is primarily attributable to EMA and North America, which increased $141.1 million (including currency benefits of approximately $20 million) and $59.7 million, respectively. Oil and gas sales to the Middle East region have contributed the most significant growth in EMA, while domestic oil and gas sales have contributed the most significant growth in North America. Original equipment increased to approximately 56% of sales in 2006, as compared with approximately 53% of sales in 2005. Gross profit in 2007 increased by $139.2 million, or 30.4%, as compared with 2006. Gross profit margin in 2007 of 28.5% increased from 28.3% in 2006. The increase is primarily attributable to increased sales, which favorably increases our absorption of fixed manufacturing costs, and our ability to implement modest price increases late in 2006, which allowed us to mitigate the impact of increased metals and other supply chain costs. This was partially offset by the significant growth in original equipment sales in 2007. While both original equipment and aftermarket sales increased, original equipment sales growth exceeded the growth in aftermarket for the period. As a result, original equipment sales increased to 60% of total sales as compared with 57% of total sales for the same period in 2006. The aftermarket business consistently provides more favorable gross margins than original equipment sales. Gross profit in 2006 increased by $61.6 million, or 15.6%, as compared with 2005. Gross profit margin in 2006 of 28.3% was comparable to 2005. In 2006, gross profit margin was positively impacted by higher sales, which favorably impacts our absorption of fixed costs, as well as CIP and supply chain initiatives. However, these were offset by a 23% increase in sales of original equipment, which carries a lower margin. Aftermarket sales increased by 8%. Operating income in 2007 increased by $101.5 million, or 58.8%, as compared with 2006. The increase includes currency benefits of approximately $18 million. The increase was due primarily to increased gross profit of $139.2 million, partially offset by a $40.5 million increase in SG&A. The increase in SG&A is primarily attributable to $22.5 million in higher selling costs, driven by an increase in sales and engineering personnel to support the global growth of our business and increased commissions resulting from increased sales levels, additional total R&D costs of $4.9 million, improvements to our ERP systems and additional compensation expense related to annual and long-term incentive plans. This was partially offset by a $5.9 million pre-tax gain on the sale of our TKL rail assets, which is included in SG&A. SG&A as a percentage of sales in 2007 improved 220 basis points as compared with 2006. The improvement in SG&A is attributable to leverage from higher sales, as well as ongoing efforts to contain costs, the gain on the sale of the TKL rail assets and severance charges recorded in 2006 that did not recur. Operating income in 2006 increased by $22.9 million, or 15.3%, as compared with 2005. The increase includes currency benefits of approximately $4 million. The increase is primarily a result of the $61.6 million improvement in gross profit, partially offset by increased commission expenses and travel to support increased bookings and sales, expenses related to stock options and increased information technology project costs. Also, 2006 includes $5.0 million of severance costs associated with the termination of redundant personnel in Europe, which accounts for 30 basis points of our SG&A as a percentage of sales. Backlog of $1.8 billion in 2007 increased by $512.0 million, or 40.5%, as compared with 2006. Currency provided an increase of approximately $114 million. The increase in backlog reflects an increase in orders of engineered products, which naturally have longer lead times, as well as expanded lead times at the request of certain customers. Backlog of $1.3 billion in 2006 increased by $559.8 million, or 79.6%, as compared with 2005. Currency provided an increase of approximately $82 million. The increase in backlog is primarily attributable to the growth in bookings discussed above. 39 Table of Contents Flow Control Division Segment Results Our second largest business segment is FCD, which designs, manufactures and distributes a broad portfolio of engineered and industrial valves, control valves, actuators, controls and related services. FCD leverages its experience and application know-how by offering a complete menu of engineered services to complement its expansive product portfolio. FCD has a total of 40 manufacturing and service facilities in 19 countries around the world, with only five of its 20 manufacturing operations located in the U.S. Based on independent industry sources, we believe that we are the third largest industrial valve supplier on a global basis. Flow Control Division 2007 2006 2005 (Amounts in millions) Bookings continuing operations $ 1,245.7 $ 1,060.9 $ 936.0 Bookings discontinued operations 90.4 Total bookings 1,245.7 1,060.9 1,026.4 Sales 1,163.2 994.8 894.3 Gross profit 405.8 338.3 287.7 Gross profit margin 34.9 % 34.0 % 32.2 % Segment operating income 163.7 115.9 92.1 Segment operating income as a percentage of sales 14.1 % 11.6 % 10.3 % Backlog (at period end) 414.8 314.3 240.6 Total bookings in 2007 increased by $184.8 million, or 17.4%, as compared with 2006. The increase includes currency benefits of approximately $56 million. The growth in bookings is primarily attributable to the sustained strength of our key end-markets. Increased project activity in the global oil and gas market, specifically in the Middle East and China, and growth in the pulp and paper market, both in Latin American and Asia, drove improved control valve bookings. Power valve bookings benefited from elevated maintenance repair operations ( MRO ) business for both the nuclear and fossil fuel power generation markets. Bookings improvement in the process valve market resulted from strength in the Chinese coal gasification and purification industries. Growth in China has contributed to bookings improvement across all aspects of our valve portfolio. Of the $1.2 billion of total bookings in 2007, approximately 33% were from chemical, 35% general industry, 20% oil and gas and 12% power. Bookings for continuing operations in 2006 increased by $124.9 million, or 13.3%, as compared with 2005. Total bookings in 2006 increased by $34.5 million, or 3.4%, as compared with 2005. The increase includes currency benefits of approximately $6 million. Total bookings in 2005 includes $90.4 million of bookings for GSG, a discontinued operation. The increase is primarily attributable to continued strengthening of several of our key end-markets. Increased bookings in the process valve market resulted from growth in the China chemical and coal gasification industries, as well as across the board strength in the North American and Middle Eastern oil and gas markets. Growth in the Russian district heating market, increased project business in the U.S. and Western European steam recovery systems, improved project business in the European chemical market, and improvements in the Asian pulp and paper industries also contributed to the increase. Of the $1.1 billion of total bookings in 2006, approximately 40% were from general industry, 29% chemical, 19% oil and gas and 12% power. Sales in 2007 increased by $168.4 million, or 16.9%, as compared with 2006. This increase includes currency benefits of approximately $52 million. The increase is principally the result of strength in both project and MRO business across all significant areas of our valve portfolio. Continued growth in Asia, particularly in the coal gasification, petrochemical and acetic acid markets, drove improvement in process valve sales. Strong project sales in the oil and gas industry, specifically in North America, the Middle East and China, also contributed to the improvement. Sales of control valves increased due to the satisfaction of large orders in the Australian mining and Asian pulp and paper markets. Increased capacity enabled fulfillment of significant Russian district heating orders placed in the later half of 2006, contributing to the growth in power valve sales. Sales in 2006 increased by $100.5 million, or 11.2%, as compared with 2005. This increase includes currency benefits of approximately $10 million. The increase is primarily attributable to notable improvements in the process valve industry, specifically in the Middle Eastern petroleum and German chemical markets, as well as the North American oil and gas industry. Also contributing to the growth in the process valves business were strong sales in 40 Table of Contents Asia chemical market, specifically acetic acid and coal gasification projects in China. Successful completion of several projects in the North American power industry also helped drive the improvement, as well as improvements in both the Asian oil and gas and European fine chemicals markets. Gross profit in 2007 increased by $67.5 million, or 20.0%, as compared with 2006. Gross profit margin in 2007 of 34.9% increased from 34.0% in 2006. The increase reflects the aforementioned higher sales levels, which favorably impacts our leverage of fixed manufacturing costs, increased efficiency as a result of our successful relocation of several product lines in 2006, and strong focus on the successful implementation of various CIP, lean manufacturing and supply chain management initiatives. Gross profit margin was also positively impacted by our ability to implement modest price increases in the first half of 2007, which enabled us to mitigate the impact of increased metals and other supply chain costs. Gross profit in 2006 increased by $50.6 million, or 17.6%, as compared with 2005. Gross profit margin in 2006 of 34.0% increased from 32.2% in 2005. The increase is due to the increase in sales, which favorably impacts our absorption of fixed costs. Strong focus on realizing margin improvements on aftermarket sales for our installed base, improved sharing of materials pricing risk with our customers, our successful implementation of various other CIP and supply chain initiatives and implementation of broad-based price increases in the latter-half of 2005 also contributed to the improvement. Operating income in 2007 increased by $47.8 million, or 41.2% as compared with 2006. This increase includes currency benefits of approximately $9 million. The increase is primarily attributable to the aforementioned $67.5 million improvement in gross profit, offset in part by higher SG&A costs, which increased $21.7 million (including negative currency effects of approximately $10 million) as compared with the same period in 2006. The increase is principally attributable to the $14.8 million of increased selling costs, primarily related to increased salary and higher external commission expense resulting from increased sales and bookings levels, as well as additional compensation expense related to our annual and long-term incentive plans. Also contributing to the increase was $4.8 million of increased total R&D costs, as well as increased legal fees and expenses related to compliance matters. Partially offsetting these increases was $6.6 million of realignment costs recognized in 2006 that did not recur. SG&A as a percentage of sales in 2007 improved 140 basis points as compared with 2006. The improvement is attributable to leverage from higher sales, as well as ongoing efforts to contain costs and realignment charges recorded in 2006 that did not recur. Operating income in 2006 increased by $23.8 million, or 25.8% as compared with 2005. This increase includes currency benefits of approximately $1 million. The increase is primarily attributable to the $50.6 million improvement in gross profit, partially offset by higher SG&A, driven primarily by increased headcount, which contributed an additional $8.5 million of compensation costs, a $1.7 million increase in information technology project costs, a $2.3 million increase in travel costs, a $1.5 million increase in equity-based incentive compensation and higher external commission expense resulting from increased sales. In 2006, we recognized $1.2 million in bad debt expense related to the bankruptcy of a single customer. Also, 2006 includes $6.6 million of costs associated with the relocation of product lines to different facilities, which accounts for 70 basis points of our SG&A as a percentage of sales. Backlog of $414.8 million at December 31, 2007 increased by $100.5 million, or 32.0%, as compared with 2006. Currency effects provided an increase of approximately $21 million. The increase in backlog is primarily attributable to increased volume, an increase in the number of project orders and longer lead times for some of the more significant oil and gas projects. Backlog of $314.3 million at December 31, 2006 increased by $73.7 million, or 30.6%, as compared with 2005. Currency effects provided an increase of approximately $16 million. The increase in backlog is primarily attributable to increased bookings, as discussed above. Flow Solutions Division Segment Results Through FSD, we engineer, manufacture and sell mechanical seals, auxiliary systems and parts, and provide related services, principally to process industries and general industrial markets, with similar products sold internally in support of FPD. FSD has added to its global operations and has nine manufacturing operations, four of which are located in the U.S. FSD operates 70 QRCs worldwide (including 5 that are co-located in a manufacturing facility), including 24 sites in North America, 18 in Europe, and the remainder in Latin America and Asia. Our ability to rapidly deliver mechanical sealing technology through global engineering tools, locally sited QRCs and 41 Table of Contents on-site engineers represents a significant competitive advantage. This business model has enabled FSD to establish a large number of alliances with multi-national customers. Based on independent industry sources, we believe that we are the second largest mechanical seal supplier in the world. Flow Solutions Division 2007 2006 2005 (Amounts in millions) Bookings $ 592.5 $ 505.0 $ 463.4 Sales 564.5 496.6 443.6 Gross profit 252.6 219.0 194.9 Gross profit margin 44.7 % 44.1 % 43.9 % Segment operating income 111.5 98.5 87.5 Segment operating income as a percentage of sales 19.8 % 19.8 % 19.7 % Backlog (at period end) 109.4 74.4 61.2 Bookings in 2007 increased by $87.5 million, or 17.3%, as compared with 2006. This increase includes currency benefits of approximately $19 million. The $77.2 million increase in customer bookings is due primarily to increases of $45.3 million and $31.9 million in project and aftermarket bookings, respectively. A $10.3 million increase in interdivision bookings (which are eliminated and are not included in consolidated bookings as disclosed above) also contributed to the increase. All regions have exhibited growth in project type customer bookings, with the strongest rates of growth occurring in the oil and gas and mining markets of North America, Latin America and Asia; in the chemical market of Asia; and in the general industry markets of all regions. Increases in aftermarket customer bookings have occurred primarily in EMA and Asia. Of the $592.5 million of bookings in 2007, approximately 45% were from oil and gas, 23% chemical, and 32% general industries. Bookings in 2006 increased by $41.6 million, or 9.0%, as compared with 2005. This increase includes currency benefits of approximately $4 million. This increase is due to a $28.7 million increase in customer bookings, which is primarily attributable to EMA and Latin America, as well as a $12.9 million increase in interdivision bookings. The increase is attributable to growth from projects including OE and end user markets with the majority of the increase coming from regions outside North America. Success in the end user market continues to be a strength based on the FSD business model, which places a premium on servicing customers locally through an increasing network of QRCs. During the period we added, rebuilt, upgraded or relocated 15 QRCs to further improve our ability to service our customers in their locale. The bookings improvement continues to reflect FSD ability to establish long-term customer alliance programs, including fixed fee contracts. This strategy of signing special fixed fee alliances in conjunction with the higher levels of local service that comes from the strategically located QRCs has led to market share gains in 2006 over 2005. Of the $505.0 million of bookings in 2006, approximately 48% were from oil and gas, 27% chemical and 25% general industries. Sales in 2007 increased by $67.9 million, or 13.7%, as compared with 2006. The increase includes currency benefits of approximately $18 million. The increase is primarily attributable to an increase in aftermarket customer sales in EMA. Increased customer project sales in North America of $13.8 million, increased project customer sales in Latin America and increased overall customer sales in Asia, as well as a $12.3 million increase in interdivision sales (which are eliminated and are not included in consolidated sales as disclosed above) all contributed to the increase. Sales in 2006 increased by $53.0 million, or 11.9%, as compared with 2005. The increase includes currency benefits of approximately $5 million. The increase is attributable to a $44.4 million increase in customer sales, primarily in North America and EMA, our two largest markets, as well as an $8.6 million increase in interdivision sales. The increase in customer sales is primarily attributable to aftermarket sales, where FSD has expanded capacity to enable it to meet customer demand for fast turnaround. Additionally, sales growth occurred in the project business and original equipment. Aftermarket and original equipment sales growth occurred in the oil and gas, chemical and mineral and ore processing industries. Gross profit in 2007 increased by $33.6 million, or 15.3%, as compared with 2006. Gross profit margin in 2007 of 44.7% increased from 44.1% in 2006. The improvements are due to a slight product shift towards the higher margin aftermarket business in EMA, which combined with a price increase earlier in 2007 and improved 42 Table of Contents absorption of fixed manufacturing costs resulting from higher sales, has offset downward margin pressures related to materials costs and a shift in North American sales towards lower margin project business. Gross profit in 2006 increased by $24.1 million, or 12.4%, as compared with 2005. Gross profit margin in 2006 of 44.1% increased slightly from 43.9% in 2005 primarily as a result of various supply chain initiatives and our ability to pass along price increases. Operating income in 2007 increased by $13.0 million, or 13.2%, as compared with 2006. The increase includes currency benefits of $5 million. The improvement in 2007 reflects the $33.6 million increase in gross profit discussed above, partially offset by a $20.4 increase in SG&A, which is attributable to an $11.5 million increase related to sales and engineering personnel and related expenses to support the global growth of our business; additional compensation related to our annual and long-term incentive plans; and an increase in legal fees and expenses related to compliance matters. SG&A as a percentage of sales in 2007 increased 60 basis points as compared with 2006. The increase is primarily attributable to compliance matters and increased depreciation of information technology upgrades, which is partially offset by increased sales. Operating income in 2006 increased by $11.0 million, or 12.6%, as compared with 2005. The increase includes currency benefits of less than $1 million. The improvement in 2006 reflects the $24.1 million increase in gross profit, partially offset by an increase in SG&A, which is attributable to increases in our global engineering and sales functions to both support our sales growth and maintain the level of service and support response that gives us our competitive advantage. Backlog of $109.4 million at December 31, 2007 increased by $35.0 million, or 47.0%, as compared with 2006. Currency provided an increase of approximately $6 million. Backlog at December 31, 2007 includes $18.1 million of interdivision backlog (which is eliminated and not included in consolidated backlog as disclosed above). The increase in backlog is primarily a result of growth in project bookings with significantly longer lead times. Backlog of $74.4 million at December 31, 2006 increased by $13.2 million, or 21.6%, as compared with 2005. Currency provided an increase of approximately $3 million. Backlog at December 31, 2006 includes $14.7 million of interdivision backlog (which is eliminated and not included in consolidated backlog as disclosed above). The increase in backlog is primarily attributable to the increased bookings discussed above. Capacity expansions in Latin America, Asia-Pacific and EMA in 2006 helped to significantly increase shipments, helping to limit the increase in backlog. LIQUIDITY AND CAPITAL RESOURCES 2007 2006 2005 (Amounts in millions) Net cash flows provided by operating activities $ 417.4 $ 163.2 $ 127.4 Net cash flows used by investing activities (77.1 ) (77.7 ) (39.3 ) Net cash flows used by financing activities (49.8 ) (114.5 ) (53.3 ) Cash Flow Analysis Cash generated by operations and borrowings available under our existing revolving line of credit are our primary sources of short-term liquidity. Our sources of operating cash generally include the sale of our products and services and the conversion of our working capital, particularly accounts receivable and inventories. Our total cash balance at December 31, 2007 was $370.6 million, compared with $67.0 million in 2006 and $92.9 million in 2005. The cash flows provided by operating activities in 2007 as compared with 2006 primarily reflect a $140.7 million increase in net income and a $105.3 million increase in cash flows from working capital, particularly due to increased accrued liabilities, reflecting increases in advanced cash received from our customers, which is partially offset by our investment in inventory, especially project-related work in process inventory required to support future shipments of products in backlog. Further, operating cash flows in 2007 reflect a decrease of $20.2 million in contributions to U.S. pension plans as compared with 2006. The cash flows provided by operating activities in 2006 primarily reflect a $98.0 million increase in net income, offset by a $32.6 million decrease in cash flows from working capital, particularly due to higher inventory of $98.4 million, especially project-related work in process inventory required to support future shipments of products in backlog. Further, operating cash flows in 2006 reflect a decrease of $8.5 million in funding of 43 Table of Contents U.S. pension plans as compared with 2005 and an increase in equity compensation ($11.3 million) due to the expensing of stock options under SFAS No. 123(R) also had positive impacts on cash flows from operating activities. Our goal for days sales receivables outstanding ( DSO ) is 60 days. For the fourth quarter of 2007, we achieved a DSO of 54 days as compared with 56 days for the same period in 2006. For reference purposes based on 2007 sales, an improvement of one day could provide approximately $12 million in cash. Increases in inventory used $101.8 million of cash flow for 2007 compared with uses of $98.4 million and $20.6 million in 2006 and 2005, respectively. Inventory turns were 4.4 times at December 31, 2007, compared with 4.4 times and 4.8 times at December 31, 2006 and 2005 respectively, reflecting the substantial increase in sales, partially offset by the large increase in inventory. For reference purposes based on 2007 data, an improvement of one turn could yield approximately $127 million in cash. Cash outflows for investing activities were $77.1 million, $77.7 million and $39.3 million in 2007, 2006 and 2005, respectively, due primarily to capital expenditures. Capital expenditures during 2007 were $89.0 million, an increase of $15.4 million as compared with 2006, which reflects increased spending to support capacity expansion, ERP application upgrades, information technology infrastructure and cost reduction opportunities. Cash outflows in 2007 were partially offset by $13.4 million of proceeds from disposals of assets. Cash outflows for financing activities were $49.8 million in 2007 compared with $114.5 million in 2006 and $53.3 million in 2005. The decrease in outflows in 2007 results primarily from reduced payments on long-term debt, partially offset by payment of cash dividends. The outflow in 2006 is primarily a result of the debt paydown and the repurchase of common shares. Our cash needs for the next 12 months are expected to increase for the following: Increased capital expenditures Increased capital expenditures in 2008 will be in support of information technology infrastructure and geographic capacity expansion, Share repurchase program On February 26, 2008, the Board of Directors authorized a new program to repurchase up to $300.0 million of our outstanding common stock over an unspecified period. The program is expected to commence by the second quarter of 2008. On September 29, 2006, the Board of Directors authorized a program to repurchase up to 2.0 million shares of our outstanding common stock. Two million shares were repurchased, including 0.7 million shares repurchased in 2007, and the program was concluded in the second quarter of 2007. Increased quarterly cash dividends On February 26, 2008, the Board of Directors authorized an increase in the quarterly cash dividend to $0.25 per share payable quarterly beginning on April 9, 2008. Quarterly cash dividends of $0.15 per share were declared in each quarter of 2007. While we currently intend to pay regular quarterly dividends in the foreseeable future, any future dividends will be reviewed individually and declared by our Board of Directors at its discretion, dependent on its assessment of our financial condition and business outlook at the applicable time. Accounts receivable factoring During the fourth quarter of 2007, we gave notice of our intent to terminate our major factoring facilities during 2008. We plan to terminate all factoring agreements by the end of 2008. Increased pension contributions Our pension contributions are currently expected to be higher in 2008 as compared with 2007, but will be re-evaluated later in 2008. We believe cash flows from operating activities, combined with availability under our revolving line of credit and our existing cash balances, will be sufficient to enable us to meet our cash flow needs for the next 12 months. However, cash flows from operations could be adversely affected by economic, political and other risks associated with sales of our products, operational factors, competition, regulatory actions, fluctuations in foreign exchange rates and fluctuations in interest rates, among other factors. Payments for Acquisitions We regularly evaluate acquisition opportunities of various sizes. The cost and terms of any financing to be raised in conjunction with any acquisition, including our ability to raise economical capital, is a critical consideration in any such evaluation. 44 Table of Contents During 2007, we completed one small acquisition for $2.3 million. During 2006, we completed four small asset acquisitions for an aggregate purchase price of $8.0 million. Assets acquired primarily include inventory, fixed assets and intangible assets. Capital Expenditures 2007 2006 2005 (Amounts in millions) Capital expenditures $ 89.0 $ 73.5 $ 49.3 Depreciation expense 67.8 60.5 59.8 Capital expenditures are funded primarily by operating cash flows and, to a lesser extent, by bank borrowings. In 2007, our capital expenditures were focused on increased spending to support capacity expansion, ERP application upgrades, information technology infrastructure and cost reduction opportunities. In 2006, our capital expenditures were focused on similar uses. In 2005, our capital expenditures were focused on new product development, information technology infrastructure and cost reduction opportunities. In previous years, capital expenditures were less than depreciation expense due to excess capacity and the upgrading of equipment through integration processes. In 2008, we expect that our capital expenditures will focus on geographic and capacity expansion, ERP application upgrades, information technology infrastructure and cost reduction opportunities and are expected to be between approximately $115 million and $125 million. Certain of our facilities may face capacity constraints in the foreseeable future, which may lead to higher capital expenditure levels. Financing Debt, including capital lease obligations, consisted of: December 31, 2007 2006 (Amounts in millions) Term Loan, interest rate of 6.40% in 2007 and 6.88% in 2006 $ 555,379 $ 558,220 Capital lease obligations and other 2,597 6,349 Debt and capital lease obligations 557,976 564,569 Less amounts due within one year 7,181 8,050 Total debt due after one year $ 550,795 $ 556,519 Credit Facilities As described in Note 11 to our consolidated financial statements included in this Annual Report, on August 12, 2005, we entered into Credit Facilities comprised of a $600.0 million term loan maturing on August 10, 2012 and a $400.0 million revolving line of credit, which can be utilized to provide up to $300.0 million in letters of credit, expiring on August 12, 2010. We refer to these credit facilities collectively as our Credit Facilities. We used the proceeds of borrowings under our Credit Facilities to refinance our 12.25% Senior Subordinated Notes and indebtedness outstanding under our previous credit facilities. Further, we replaced the letter of credit agreement that guaranteed our EIB credit facility with a letter of credit issued as part of the Credit Facilities. On August 6, 2007, we amended our Credit Facilities to, among other things, reduce the applicable margin applied to borrowings under the revolving line of credit, as well as extend the maturity date of the revolving line of credit, by two years to August 12, 2012. The amendment also eliminates all mandatory debt repayment requirements and the restriction on capital expenditures. The amendment further replaces the dollar limitation on acquisitions and certain restricted payments, with a limitation based on pro forma compliance with the required leverage ratio in both cases. Borrowings under our Credit Facilities bear interest at a rate equal to, at our option, either (1) the base rate (which is based on greater of the prime rate most recently announced by the administrative agent under our Credit Facilities or the Federal Funds rate plus 0.50%) or (2) London Interbank Offered Rate ( LIBOR ) plus an applicable margin determined by reference to the ratio of our total debt to consolidated Earnings Before Interest, Taxes, Depreciation and Amortization ( EBITDA ), which as of December 31, 2007 was 1.00% and 1.50% for borrowings 45 Table of Contents under our revolving line of credit and term loan, respectively. At both December 31, 2007 and 2006, we had no amounts outstanding under the revolving line of credit. We had outstanding letters of credit of $115.1 million and $83.9 million at December 31, 2007 and 2006, respectively, which reduced our borrowing capacity to $284.9 million and $316.1 million, respectively. In connection with our Credit Facilities, we have entered into $395.0 million of notional amount of interest rate swaps at December 31, 2007 to hedge exposure of floating interest rates. European Letter of Credit Facility On September 14, 2007, we entered into an unsecured European Letter of Credit Facility ( European LOC ) to issue letters of credit in an aggregate face amount not to exceed 150.0 million at any time, with an initial commitment of 80.0 million. The aggregate commitment of the European LOC may be increased up to 150.0 million as may be agreed among the parties, and may be decreased by us at our option without any premium, fee or penalty. The European LOC will be used for contingent obligations solely in respect of surety and performance bonds, bank guarantees and similar obligations. We had outstanding letters of credit drawn on the European LOC of 35.0 million as of December 31, 2007. We will pay certain fees for the letters of credit written against the European LOC based upon the ratio of our total debt to consolidated EBITDA. As of December 31, 2007 the annual fees equaled 0.5% plus a fronting fee of 0.1%. Debt Prepayments and Repayments We made scheduled repayments of $2.8 million, $0 and $1.5 million in 2007, 2006 and 2005, respectively. We made mandatory repayments of $0, $15.3 million and $0 in 2007, 2006 and 2005, respectively. Mandatory repayments in 2006 consisted of $14.4 million, using the net cash proceeds from the sale of GSG, and $0.9 million, using excess cash flows as defined by the Credit Facilities. We made no optional prepayments in 2007. In 2006, we made optional prepayments of $5.0 million under our Credit Facilities, and we terminated our EIB Credit Facility and repaid the outstanding principle balance of $85.0 million. In 2005, we made optional prepayments of $20.0 million under our Credit Facilities and optional payments of $18.4 million under other financing arrangements. We may prepay loans under our Credit Facilities in whole or in part, without premium or penalty. Accounts Receivable Factoring Through our European subsidiaries, we engage in non-recourse factoring of certain accounts receivable. The various agreements have different terms, including options for renewal and mutual termination clauses. Our Credit Facilities, which are fully described in Note 11 to our consolidated financial statements included in this Annual Report, limit factoring volume to $75.0 million at any given point in time as defined by our Credit Facilities. During the fourth quarter of 2007, we gave notice of our intent to terminate our major factoring facilities during 2008. We plan to terminate all factoring agreements by the end of 2008. Debt Covenants and Other Matters Our Credit Facilities contain leverage and interest coverage financial covenants. Under the leverage covenant, the maximum permitted leverage ratio stepped down in the fourth quarter of 2006. On August 7, 2007 our Credit Facilities were amended to, among other things, permit a maximum leverage ratio of 3.25 times debt to EBITDA with no further reductions. Under the interest coverage covenant, the minimum required interest coverage ratio stepped up in the fourth quarter of 2006, with a further step-up beginning in the fourth quarter of 2007. Compliance with these financial covenants under our Credit Facilities is tested quarterly. Our Credit Facilities include events of default usual for these types of credit facilities, including nonpayment of principal or interest, violation of covenants, incorrectness of representations and warranties, cross defaults and cross acceleration, bankruptcy, material judgments, Employee Retirement Income Security Act of 1974, as amended ( ERISA ), events, actual or asserted invalidity of the guarantees or the security documents and certain changes of control of our company. The occurrence of any event of default could result in the acceleration of our and the guarantors obligations under the Credit Facilities. We complied with the covenants through December 31, 2007. Our European LOC contains covenants restricting the ability of certain foreign subsidiaries to issue debt, incur liens, sell assets, merge, consolidate, make certain investments, pay dividends, enter into agreements with negative 46 Table of Contents pledge clauses or engage in any business activity other than our existing business. The European LOC also incorporates by reference the covenants contained in our Credit Facilities. Our European LOC includes events of default usual for these types of letter of credit facilities, including nonpayment of any fee or obligation, violation of covenants, incorrectness of representations and warranties, cross defaults and cross acceleration, bankruptcy, material judgments, ERISA events, actual or asserted invalidity of the guarantees and certain changes of control of our company. The occurrence of any event of default could result in the termination of the commitments and an acceleration of our obligations under the European LOC. We complied with the covenants through December 31, 2007. CONTRACTUAL OBLIGATIONS AND COMMERCIAL COMMITMENTS The following table presents a summary of our contractual obligations at December 31, 2007: Payments Due by Period Beyond 5 Within 1 Year 1-3 Years 3-5 Years Years Total (Amounts in millions) Long-term debt $ 5.7 $ 11.4 $ 538.3 $ $ 555.4 Fixed interest payments(1) 2.5 1.9 4.4 Variable interest payments(2) 34.9 68.5 45.2 148.6 Capital lease obligations 0.2 0.5 0.7 Operating leases 34.5 50.0 27.8 15.2 127.5 Purchase obligations:(3) Inventory 517.5 11.1 528.6 Non-inventory 55.7 3.3 0.3 59.3 Retirement and postretirement benefits(4) 44.3 94.5 94.8 236.4 470.0 Total $ 695.3 $ 241.2 $ 706.4 $ 251.6 $ 1,894.5 (1) Fixed interest payments include payments (receipts) on synthetically fixed rate debt. (2) Variable interest payments under our Credit Facilities were estimated using a base rate of three-month LIBOR as of December 31, 2007. (3) Purchase obligations are presented at the face value of the purchase order, excluding the effects of early termination provisions. Actual payments could be less than amounts presented herein. (4) Retirement and postretirement benefits represent estimated benefit payments for our U.S. and non-U.S. defined benefit plans and our postretirement medical plan, as more fully described below and in Note 12 to our consolidated financial statements included in this Annual Report. As of December 31, 2007, the gross liability for uncertain tax positions under FIN No. 48 is approximately $145 million. We do not expect a material payment related to these obligations to be made within the next twelve months. We are unable to provide a reasonably reliable estimate of the timing of future payments relating to the non-current FIN No. 48 obligations. The following table presents a summary of our commercial commitments at December 31, 2007: Commitment Expiration by Period Beyond 5 Within 1 Year 1-3 Years 3-5 Years Years Total (Amounts in millions) Letters of credit $ 332.8 $ 118.3 $ 27.4 $ 2.3 $ 480.8 Surety bonds 29.6 0.3 1.0 30.9 Total $ 362.4 $ 118.6 $ 28.4 $ 2.3 $ 511.7 We expect to satisfy these commitments through performance under our contracts. 47 Table of Contents PENSION AND POSTRETIREMENT BENEFITS OBLIGATIONS Our pension plans and postretirement benefit plans are accounted for using actuarial valuations required by SFAS No. 87, Employers Accounting for Pensions, and SFAS No. 106, Employers Accounting for Postretirement Benefits Other Than Pensions. We consider accounting for retirement plans critical because management is required to make significant subjective judgments about a number of actuarial assumptions, including discount rates, salary growth, long-term return on plan assets, retirement, turnover, health care cost trend rates and mortality rates. Depending on the assumptions and estimates used, the pension and postretirement benefit expense could vary within a range of outcomes and have a material effect on reported earnings. In addition, the assumptions can materially affect accumulated benefit obligations and future cash funding. Plan Description We and certain of our subsidiaries have defined benefit pension plans and defined contribution plans for regular full-time and part-time employees. The defined benefit pension plan in the U.S. is the Flowserve Corporation Pension Plan and the defined contribution plan in the U.S. is the Flowserve Corporation Retirement Savings Plan. Approximately 66% of total defined benefit pension plan assets and 54% of benefit obligations are related to the U.S. plan as of December 31, 2007. The assets for the U.S. plan are held in a single trust with a common asset allocation. Unless specified otherwise, the references in this section are to total plans (i.e., the U.S. plan together with international plans). Benefits under our defined benefit pension plans are based primarily on years of credited service and on participants compensation. Assets under our defined benefit pension plans consist primarily of equity and fixed-income securities. At December 31, 2007, the estimated fair market value of plan assets for our defined benefit plans increased to $382.3 million from $365.1 million at December 31, 2006. Assets were allocated as follows: U.S. Plan Non-U.S. Plans Asset category 2007 2006 2007 2006 Equity securities 65 % 65 % 50 % 50 % Fixed income 25 % 25 % 47 % 38 % Other 10 % 10 % 3 % 12 % The projected benefit obligation for our defined benefit pension plans was $555.0 million and $544.5 million as of December 31, 2007 and 2006, respectively. The estimated prior service benefit for the defined benefit pension plans that will be amortized from accumulated other comprehensive loss into pension expense in 2008 is $1.3 million. The estimated net loss for the defined benefit pension plans that will be amortized from accumulated other comprehensive loss into pension expense in 2008 is $4.7 million. None of our common stock is directly held by these plans. We sponsor a defined benefit postretirement health care plan covering most current retirees and a limited number of future retirees in the U.S. This plan provides for medical and dental benefits and is administered through insurance companies. We fund the plan as benefits are paid, such that the plans hold no assets in any period presented. Accordingly, we have no investment strategy or targeted allocations for plan assets. The benefits under the plan are not available to new employees or most existing employees. The accumulated postretirement benefit obligation for our defined benefit postretirement health care plan was $62.3 million and $71.4 million as of December 31, 2007 and 2006, respectively. Accrual Accounting and Significant Assumptions Consistent with the requirements of SFAS No. 87, we account for pension benefits using the accrual method, recognizing pension expense before the payment of benefits to retirees. The accrual method of accounting for pension benefits necessarily requires actuarial assumptions concerning future events that will determine the amount and timing of the benefit payments. 48 Table of Contents Our key assumptions used in calculating our cost of pension benefits are the discount rate, the rate of compensation increase, and the expected long-term rate of return on plan assets. We, in consultation with our actuaries, evaluate the key actuarial assumptions and other assumptions used in calculating the cost of pension benefits, such as discount rate, expected return on plan assets for funded plans, life expectancy of participants and assumed rate of wage increases, and determine such assumptions as of December 31 of each year to calculate liability information as of that date and pension expense for the following year. Depending on the assumptions used, the pension expense could vary within a range of outcomes and have a material effect on reported earnings. In addition, the assumptions can materially affect accumulated benefit obligations and future cash funding. Actual results in any given year may differ from those estimated because of economic and other factors. The assumed discount rate used for determining future pension obligations is based on indices of AA-rated corporate bonds, except for one foreign location, which uses government bonds. The assumed rate of compensation increase used for determining future pension obligations reflects an estimate of the change in actual future compensation levels due to general price levels, productivity, seniority and other factors. The expected long-term rate of return on assets was determined by assessing the rates of return for each targeted asset class and return premiums generated by active portfolio management. In 2007, net pension expense for our defined benefit pension plans included in income from continuing operations was $32.1 million compared with $33.7 million in 2006 and $28.6 million in 2005. The postretirement benefit (gain) expense for the postretirement health care plan was $(0.1) million in 2007 compared with $0.7 million in 2006 and $0.8 million in 2005. The following are assumptions related to our defined benefit pension plans for the year ended December 31, 2007: U.S. Plan Non-U.S. Plans Weighted average assumptions used to determine benefit obligations: Discount rate 6.25 % 5.61 % Rate of increase in compensation levels 4.50 3.32 Weighted average assumptions used to determine net cost: Long-term rate of return on assets 7.75 % 5.91 % Discount rate 5.75 4.78 Rate of increase in compensation levels 4.50 3.23 The following provides a sensitivity analysis of alternative assumptions on the U.S. qualified and aggregate non-U.S. pension plans and U.S. postretirement plans. Effect of Discount Rate Changes and Constancy of Other Assumptions: 0.5% 0.5% Increase Decrease (Amounts in millions) U.S. defined benefit pension plan: Effect on pension expense $ (1.0 ) $ 0.9 Effect on Projected Benefit Obligation (11.5 ) 12.0 Non-U.S. defined benefit pension plans: Effect on pension expense (1.1 ) 1.3 Effect on Projected Benefit Obligation (19.2 ) 21.7 U.S. Postretirement medical plans: Effect on postretirement medical expense (0.3 ) (0.3 ) Effect on Projected Benefit Obligation (1.9 ) 1.9 49 Table of Contents Effect of Changes in the Expected Return on Assets and Constancy of Other Assumptions: 0.5% 0.5% Increase Decrease (Amounts in millions) U.S. defined benefit pension plan: Effect on pension expense $ (1.1 ) $ 1.1 Effect on Projected Benefit Obligation N/A N/A Non-U.S. defined benefit pension plans: Effect on pension expense (0.6 ) 0.6 Effect on Projected Benefit Obligation N/A N/A U.S. Postretirement medical plans: Effect on postretirement medical expense N/A N/A Effect on Projected Benefit Obligation N/A N/A As discussed below, accounting principles generally accepted in the U.S. ( GAAP ) provides that differences between expected and actual returns are recognized over the average future service of employees. At December 31, 2007, we increased our assumed discount rate for the U.S. plan from 5.75% to 6.25% consistent with increased 10-year bond yields and our average rate for non-U.S. plans from 4.78% to 5.61%. We maintained our average assumed rate of compensation increase at 4.5% for the U.S. plan. We increased the expected rate of return on U.S. plan assets from 7.5% for 2006 to 7.75% for 2007, primarily to reflect expected long-term equity returns. We expect that the net pension expense for our defined benefit pension plans included in earnings before income taxes will be $0.2 million lower in 2008 than the $32.1 million in 2007, reflecting, among other things, the increase in the assumed discount rate. We expect the 2008 expense for the postretirement health care plan to be $1.4 million. We have used the same assumed discount rates of 5.75% and 5.50% at December 31, 2007 and 2006, respectively, in calculating our cost of pension benefits and our cost of other postretirement benefits for U.S. plans. The assumed ranges for the annual rates of increase in per capita health care costs were 8.8% for 2007, 9.0% for 2006 and 8.0% for 2005, with a gradual decrease to 5.0% for 2012 and future years. If actual costs are higher than those assumed, this will likely put modest upward pressure on our expense for retiree health care. Plan Funding Our funding policy for defined benefit plans is to contribute at least the amounts required under applicable laws and local customs. We contributed $30.1 million, $45.7 million and $53.1 million to our defined benefit plans in 2007, 2006 and 2005, respectively. In 2008, we expect to contribute approximately $30 million to our qualified U.S. pension plan, and we expect to contribute approximately $13 million to our non-U.S. pension plans. On August 17, 2006, President Bush signed into law the Pension Protection Act of 2006 (the PPA ). Among other things, the PPA established minimum funding standards for defined benefit plans for plan years beginning after 2007 and provided for accelerated vesting of employer contributions to defined contribution plans beginning in 2007. For further discussions on retirement benefits, see Note 12 to our consolidated financial statements included in this Annual Report. OUR CRITICAL ACCOUNTING ESTIMATES The process of preparing financial statements in conformity with GAAP requires the use of estimates and assumptions to determine reported amounts of certain assets, liabilities, revenues and expenses and the disclosure of related contingent assets and liabilities. These estimates and assumptions are based upon information available at the time of the estimates or assumptions, including our historical experience, where relevant. The most significant estimates made by management include; timing and amount of revenue recognition; deferred taxes, tax valuation allowances and tax reserves; reserves for contingent losses; retirement and postretirement benefits; and valuation of goodwill, indefinite-lived intangible assets and other long-lived assets. The significant estimates are reviewed 50 Table of Contents quarterly by management with oversight by our Disclosure Control Committee, an internal committee comprised of members of senior management, and the Disclosure Control Committee presents its views to the Audit Committee of our Board of Directors. Because of the uncertainty of factors surrounding the estimates, assumptions and judgments used in the preparation of our financial statements, actual results may differ from the estimates, and the difference may be material. Our critical accounting policies are those policies that are both most important to our financial condition and results of operations and require the most difficult, subjective or complex judgments on the part of management in their application, often as a result of the need to make estimates about the effect of matters that are inherently uncertain. We believe that the following represent our critical accounting policies. For a summary of all of our significant accounting policies, see Note 1 to our consolidated financial statements included in this Annual Report. Management and our external auditors have discussed our critical accounting policies with the Audit Committee of our Board of Directors. Revenue Recognition Revenues for product sales are recognized when the risks and rewards of ownership are transferred to the customers, which is based on the contractual delivery terms agreed to with the customer and fulfillment of all but inconsequential or perfunctory actions. In addition, our policy requires persuasive evidence of an arrangement, a fixed or determinable sales price and reasonable assurance of collectibility. For contracts containing multiple elements, each having a determinable fair value, we recognize revenue in an amount equal to the element pro rata share of the contract fair value in accordance with the contractual delivery terms for each element. Freight charges billed to customers are included in sales and the related shipping costs are included in cost of sales in our consolidated statements of income. Revenues for long-term contracts, which include contracts that exceed certain internal thresholds regarding the size and duration of the project and provide for the receipt of progress billings from the customer, are recorded on the percentage of completion method with progress measured on a cost-to-cost basis. Percentage of completion revenue represents less than 14% of our consolidated sales in 2007. Revenue on service and repair contracts is recognized after services have been agreed to by the customer and rendered. Revenues generated under fixed fee service and repair contracts are recognized on a ratable basis over the term of the contract. These contracts can range in duration, but generally extend for up to five years. Fixed fee service contracts represent less than 1% of our consolidated sales in 2007. In certain instances, we provide guaranteed completion dates under the terms of our contracts. Failure to meet contractual delivery dates can result in late delivery penalties or non-recoverable costs. In instances where the payment of such costs are deemed to be probable, we perform a project profitability analysis accounting for such costs as a reduction of realizable revenues, which could potentially cause estimated total project costs to exceed projected total revenues realized from the project. In such instances, we would record reserves to cover such excesses in the period they are determined, which would adversely affect our results of operations and financial position. In circumstances where the total projected reduced revenues still exceed total projected costs, the incurrence of unrealized incentive fees or non-recoverable costs generally reduces profitability of the project at the time of subsequent revenue recognition. Our reported results would change if different estimates were used for contract costs or if different estimates were used for contractual contingencies. Deferred Taxes, Tax Valuation Allowances and Tax Reserves We recognize valuation allowances to reduce the carrying value of deferred tax assets to amounts that we expect are more likely than not to be realized. Our valuation allowances primarily relate to the deferred tax assets established for certain tax credit carryforwards and net operating loss carryforwards for U.S. and non-U.S. subsidiaries, and we evaluate the realizability of our deferred tax assets by assessing the related valuation allowance and by adjusting the amount of these allowances, if necessary. We assess such factors as our forecast of future taxable income and available tax planning strategies that could be implemented to realize the net deferred tax assets in determining the sufficiency of our valuation allowances. Failure to achieve forecasted taxable income in the applicable tax jurisdictions could affect the ultimate realization of deferred tax assets and could result in an increase in our effective tax rate on future earnings. Implementation of different tax structures in certain jurisdictions could, if successful, result in future reductions of certain valuation allowances. 51 Table of Contents The amount of income taxes we pay is subject to ongoing audits by federal, state and foreign tax authorities, which often result in proposed assessments. Significant judgment is required in determining income tax provisions and evaluating tax positions. We establish reserves for open tax years for uncertain tax positions that may be subject to challenge by various tax authorities. The consolidated tax provision and related accruals include the impact of such reasonably estimable losses and related interest and penalties as deemed appropriate. On January 1, 2007, we adopted FIN No. 48, which addresses the determination of whether tax benefits claimed or expected to be claimed on a tax return should be recorded in the financial statements. Under FIN No. 48, we may recognize the tax benefit from an uncertain tax position only if it is more likely than not that the tax position will be sustained on examination by the taxing authorities. The determination is based on the technical merits of the position and presumes that each uncertain tax position will be examined by the relevant taxing authority that has full knowledge of all relevant information. The tax benefits recognized in the financial statements from such a position are measured based on the largest benefit that has a greater than fifty percent likelihood of being realized upon ultimate settlement. FIN No. 48 also provides guidance on derecognition, classification, interest and penalties on income taxes, accounting in interim periods and requires increased disclosures. We believe we have adequately provided for any reasonably foreseeable outcome related to these matters, and our future results may include favorable or unfavorable adjustments to our estimated tax liabilities. To the extent that the expected tax outcome of these matters changes, such changes in estimate will impact the income tax provision in the period in which such determination is made. Reserves for Contingent Loss Liabilities are recorded for various contingencies arising in the normal course of business when it is both probable that a loss has been incurred and such loss is estimable. Assessments of reserves are based on information obtained from our independent and in-house experts, including recent legal decisions and loss experience in similar situations. The recorded legal reserves are susceptible to changes due to new developments regarding the facts and circumstances of each matter, changes in political environments, legal venue and other factors. Recorded environmental reserves could change based on further analysis of our properties, technological innovation and regulatory environment changes. Retirement and Postretirement Benefits Determination of the value of our retirement and postretirement benefits liabilities is based on actuarial valuations. Inherent in these valuations are key assumptions that are assessed annually in the fourth quarter and which include: discount rates; expected return on plan assets for funded plans; life expectancy of participants; assumed rate of wage increases; and assumed rate of health care cost increases. We evaluate, in conjunction with our professional advisors, prevailing market conditions in countries where plans are maintained, including appropriate rates of return, interest rates and medical inflation rates. Specifically for our U.S. plan, we assess such market factors as changes in the cash balance interest crediting rate, borrowing rates for investment grade corporate and industrial companies, assumptions used by Fortune 500 companies, our actual wage increases in recent years, expected rates of return for each targeted asset class held by the plans and return premiums generated by active investment management. For the non-U.S. plans we perform similar analyses, but also factor in local laws and requirements. We also compare our significant assumptions with our peers and discuss our key assumptions, prior to their incorporation into actuarial calculations, with the Finance Committee of our Board of Directors. We evaluate the funded status of each retirement plan using current assumptions and determine the appropriate funding level considering applicable regulatory requirements, tax deductibility, reporting considerations, cash flow requirements and other factors. 52 Table of Contents Valuation of Goodwill, Indefinite-Lived Intangible Assets and Other Long-Lived Assets We record all assets and liabilities acquired in purchase acquisitions, including goodwill, indefinite-lived intangibles and other intangibles at fair value, as required by SFAS No. 141, Business Combinations. The initial recording of goodwill and intangibles requires subjective judgments concerning estimates of the fair value of the acquired assets. Goodwill and indefinite-lived intangible assets are not amortized, but are subject to annual impairment tests. We test the value of goodwill and indefinite-lived intangible assets for impairment as of December 31 each year or whenever events or circumstances indicate such assets may be impaired. The test for goodwill impairment involves significant judgment in estimating projections of fair value generated through future performance of each of the reporting units, which correlate to our operating segments. The test of indefinite-lived intangibles involves significant judgment in estimating projections of future sales levels. Impairment losses for goodwill are recognized whenever the implied fair value of goodwill is less than the carrying value. Impairment losses for intangibles are recognized whenever the estimated fair value is less than the carrying value. In calculating the fair value of the reporting units using the present value of estimated future cash flows, we rely on a number of factors including operating results, business plans, economic projections, anticipated future cash flows and market data used in discounting those cash flows. Inherent uncertainties exist in determining and applying such factors. The discount rate used in the projection of fair value represents an internally estimated weighted average cost of capital of 9.3%. The net realizable value of other long-lived assets, including property, plant and equipment, is reviewed periodically, when indicators of potential impairments are present, based upon an assessment of the estimated future cash flows related to those assets, utilizing methodologies similar to that for goodwill and indefinite-lived assets. Additional considerations related to our long-lived assets include expected maintenance and improvements, changes in expected uses and ongoing operating performance and utilization. Due to uncertain market conditions and potential changes in strategy and product portfolio, it is possible that forecasts used to support asset carrying values may change in the future, which could result in non-cash charges that would adversely affect our results of operations and financial condition. ACCOUNTING DEVELOPMENTS We have presented the information about accounting pronouncements not yet implemented in Note 1 to our consolidated financial statements included in this Annual Report. OUTLOOK FOR 2008 Our future results of operations and other forward-looking statements contained in this Annual Report, including this MD&A, involve a number of risks and uncertainties in particular, the statements regarding our goals and strategies, new product introductions, plans to cultivate new businesses, future economic conditions, revenue, pricing, gross margin and costs, capital spending, depreciation and amortization, R&D expenses, potential impairment of investments, the tax rate and pending tax and legal proceedings. Our future results of operations may also be affected by the amount, type and valuation of the share-based awards granted, as well as the amount of awards forfeited due to employee turnover. In addition to the various important factors discussed above, a number of other factors could cause actual results to differ materially from our expectations. See the risks described in Risk Factors in Part I, Item 1A included in this Annual Report. We experienced continued strengthening in our markets in 2007, and we remain optimistic about our markets and our performance in 2008, considering that the economic opportunities in many of our geographic and core industrial markets continue to be strong. As a result of these factors, our revenues are expected to increase from 2007, excluding currency fluctuations. For additional discussion on our markets, see the Business Overview Our Markets section of this MD&A. Our bookings increased 19.4% in 2007 as compared with 2006, which should translate into increased revenue in 2008. However, as a booking represents a contract that can be modified or canceled, there is no guarantee that the increase in bookings will result in the same increase in revenues. Additionally, as lead times have extended, the timing for conversion of a booking into revenue is extending accordingly. We expect our operating income to increase in 2008 as compared with 2007, although there are a numbers of factors that could have a significant impact on our operating income in 2008. Our 2008 operating income should 53 Table of Contents continue to benefit from increased sales, which favorably impacts our absorption of fixed manufacturing costs, as well as a number of operational improvement programs and increased utilization of our facilities. In addition, continuation of our end user strategy, selective contract bidding and implemented price increases should also positively contribute to our operating income in 2008. However, a number of significant costs and certain other expenses will negatively impact our operating income in 2008. These include selected investments in technology infrastructure to consolidate our ERP systems; professional fees incurred in the implementation of tax strategies; an increase in R&D spending; and higher wage and benefit costs due to inflation and share-based compensation. Additionally, the large proportion of original equipment business booked in 2007 by FPD may reduce gross profit margin as those products are shipped in 2008 and beyond. On August 7, 2007, we amended our Credit Facilities to, among other things, reduce the applicable margin applied to borrowings under the revolving line of credit, as well as extend the maturity date of the revolving line of credit by two years, to August 12, 2012. All of our borrowings under our Credit Facilities carry a floating rate of interest. As of December 31, 2007 we had $395.0 million of derivative contracts to convert a portion of floating interest rates to fixed interest rates to reduce our exposure to interest rate volatility. As a result of reducing the volatility of the interest expense and reducing the applicable margin applied to our borrowings, we expect our interest expense in 2008 will be comparable to 2007. However, because a portion of our debt carries a floating rate of interest, the debt is subject to volatility in rates, which could negatively impact interest expense. Our results of operations may also be impacted by unfavorable foreign currency exchange rate movements. See Item 7A. Quantitative and Qualitative Disclosures about Market Risk. We expect to generate sufficient cash from operations to fund our business, capital expenditures, dividend payments, debt payments and pension plan contribution obligations and reduce our utilization of accounts receivable factoring arrangements. We seek to continue to improve our working capital utilization, with a particular focus on improving the management of accounts receivable and inventory, and requiring progress billings from customers on long lead time projects. However, the amount of cash generated or consumed by working capital is dependent on our level of revenues, backlog, customer acceptance and other factors. In 2008, our capital expenditures are focused on strategic initiatives to pursue new markets, geographic expansion, capacity expansion, ERP application upgrades, information technology infrastructure and cost reduction opportunities and are expected to be between approximately $115 million and $125 million, before consideration of any acquisition activity. While current pension regulations allow us latitude in the amount of contributions, we currently anticipate that our minimum contribution to our qualified U.S. pension plan will be approximately $30 million in 2008. We currently anticipate that our contributions to our non-U.S. pension plans will be approximately $13 million in 2008. We have $5.6 million in scheduled repayments in 2008 under our Credit Facilities. We expect to comply with the covenants under our Credit Facilities in 2008. See the Liquidity and Capital Resources section of this MD&A for further discussion of our debt covenants. As we have discussed in this and prior publicly filed reports, we are currently subject to lawsuits, internal investigations and regulatory investigations in the U.S. and in foreign countries, which could negatively impact our cash flows and results of operations. We believe we are currently dealing with these matters appropriately, and we are diligently striving to achieve the most favorable results. In February 2007, the Board of Directors approved a quarterly dividend of $0.15 a share. Additional dividends of $0.15 a share were approved in May, August and November of 2007. Each quarter the Board of Directors will continue to evaluate paying a dividend as a method to return capital to our shareholders. We expect that our corporate representatives will, from time to time, meet privately with investors, investment analysts, the media and others, and may reiterate the forward-looking statements contained in this Outlook for 2008 section and elsewhere in this Annual Report, including any such statements that are incorporated by reference in this Annual Report. At the same time, we will keep this Annual Report and our most current Business Outlook publicly available on our Investor Relations web site (www.intc.com). The public can continue to rely on the Business Outlook published on the web site as representing our current expectations on matters covered, unless we publish a notice stating otherwise. Statements in the Business Outlook and other forward-looking statements in this Annual Report are subject to revision during the course of the year in our quarterly earnings releases and SEC filings and at other times. 54 Table of Contents
