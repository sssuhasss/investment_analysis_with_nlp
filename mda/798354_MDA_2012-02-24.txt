Results of operations . This section contains an analysis of our results of operations by comparing the results for the year ended December 31, 2011 to the results for the year ended December 31, 2010, and comparing the results for the year ended December 31, 2010 to the results for the year ended December 31, 2009. Liquidity and capital resources . This section provides an analysis of our cash flows and a discussion of our outstanding debt and commitments at December 31, 2011. 19 Table of Contents Overview Company Background We are a leading global provider of financial services technology. We provide account processing systems, electronic payments processing products and services, Internet and mobile banking systems, and related services. We serve approximately 16,000 clients worldwide including banks, thrifts, credit unions, investment management firms, leasing and finance companies, retailers, merchants and government agencies. The majority of our revenue is generated from recurring account- and transaction-based fees under contracts that generally have terms of three to five years, and we have experienced high contract renewal rates with our clients. The majority of the services we provide are necessary for our clients to operate their business and are, therefore, non-discretionary in nature. Our operations are primarily in the United States and are comprised of the Payments and Industry Products ( Payments ) segment, the Financial Institution Services ( Financial ) segment and the Corporate and Other segment. The Payments segment primarily provides electronic bill payment and presentment services, debit and other card-based payment products and services, Internet and mobile banking software and services, and other electronic payments software and services including account-to-account transfers and person-to-person payments. Our businesses in this segment also provide investment account processing services for separately managed accounts, card and print personalization services, and fraud and risk management products and services. The Financial segment provides banks, thrifts and credit unions with account processing services, item processing and source capture services, loan origination and servicing products, cash management and consulting services, and other products and services that support numerous types of financial transactions. The Corporate and Other segment primarily consists of unallocated corporate expenses, amortization of acquisition-related intangible assets and intercompany eliminations. In September 2011, we acquired CashEdge Inc. ( CashEdge ), a leading provider of consumer and business payments solutions such as account-to-account transfer, account opening and funding, data aggregation, small business invoicing and payments, and person-to-person payments, for approximately $460 million, net of cash acquired. The acquisition of CashEdge is expected to advance our digital payments strategies. In the first quarter of 2011, we acquired Mobile Commerce Ltd. ( M-Com ), an international mobile banking and payments provider, and two other companies for an aggregate purchase price of approximately $50 million. M-Com enhances our mobile and payments capabilities, and the other acquired companies add to or enhance specific products or services that we already provide. Enterprise Priorities We continue to implement a series of strategic initiatives to help accomplish our mission of providing integrated technology and services solutions that enable best-in-class results for our clients. These strategic initiatives include active portfolio management of our various businesses, enhancing the overall value of our existing client relationships, improving operational effectiveness, being disciplined in our allocation of capital, and differentiating our products and services through innovation. Our key enterprise priorities for 2012 are: (i) to deliver improved financial performance including an increased level of high quality revenue growth; (ii) to further center the Fiserv culture on growth resulting in more clients and deeper client relationships and to secure a higher share of strategic solutions; and (iii) to provide innovative solutions that increase differentiation and enhance results for our clients. Industry Trends Market and regulatory conditions have continued to create a difficult operating environment for financial institutions and other businesses in the United States and internationally. As a result, financial institutions have 20 Table of Contents exercised caution in their information technology spending. Despite this environment, in 2011, our revenue increased 5%, to $4.3 billion, as compared to 2010; net income per share from continuing operations increased 2% to $3.40, which included a charge of $0.37 per share for the loss on early debt extinguishment, as compared to 2010; and net cash provided by operating activities from continuing operations was $953 million. We believe this revenue growth demonstrates the resilience of our recurring fee-based revenue model, the largely non-discretionary nature of our products and services, and mild improvement in the general condition of the financial industry. In recent years, many of our financial institution clients have finalized their spending decisions later in the year. As a result, we have seen, and expect to continue to see, a larger percentage of our annual revenue occurring in the second half of the year. We believe that financial institutions are increasingly focused on technology solutions that we provide to help them win and retain customers, generate incremental revenue and enhance their operating efficiency. We anticipate that we will benefit over the long term from the trend of financial institutions moving from in-house transaction processing solutions to outsourced solutions. In each of 2010 and 2009, approximately 1% of all financial institutions in the United States failed or were subject to government action. The number of government actions and the average size of institutions impacted by such actions decreased in 2011 as compared to 2010. These reductions resulted in the loss of a small number of our clients. In 2012, we believe that the number of government actions will continue to decline as compared to 2011. Bank failures and forced consolidations have been, to some extent, offset by a general decline in the level of acquisition activity among financial institutions. A consolidation benefits us when a newly combined institution is processed on our platform, or elects to move to one of our platforms, and negatively impacts us when a competing platform is selected. Consolidations and acquisitions also impact our financial results due to early contract termination fees in our multi-year client contracts. These fees are primarily generated when an existing client is acquired by another financial institution and can vary from period to period based on the number and size of clients that are acquired and how early in the contract term the contract is terminated. We generally do not receive contract termination fees when a financial institution is subject to a government action. In addition, legislation such as the Dodd-Frank Wall Street Reform and Consumer Protection Act has generated, and will continue to generate, numerous new regulations that will impact the financial industry. It is too early, however, to fully determine the overall impact of this complex legislation on us or our clients over the long term. Business Developments We continue to invest in the development of new and strategic products in categories such as payments, including person-to-person payments; Mobiliti for mobile banking and payments services; account processing, including Acumen, our next generation account processing platform for large credit unions; and others that we believe will increase value to our clients and enhance the capabilities of our existing solutions. We believe our wide range of market-leading solutions along with the investments we are making in new and differentiated products will favorably position us and our clients to capitalize on opportunities in the marketplace. Critical Accounting Policies General Our consolidated financial statements and accompanying notes have been prepared in accordance with accounting principles generally accepted in the United States. The preparation of these financial statements requires our management to make estimates, judgments and assumptions that affect the reported amount of assets, liabilities, revenue and expenses. We continually evaluate the accounting policies and estimates that we use to prepare our consolidated financial statements. We base our estimates on historical experience and assumptions that we believe are reasonable in light of current circumstances. Actual amounts and results could differ materially from these estimates. 21 Table of Contents Acquisitions We allocate the purchase price of acquired businesses to the assets acquired and liabilities assumed in the transaction at their estimated fair values. The estimates used to determine the fair value of long-lived assets, such as intangible assets, can be complex and require significant judgments. We use information available to us to make fair value determinations and engage independent valuation specialists, when necessary, to assist in the fair value determination of significant acquired long-lived assets. We are also required to estimate the useful lives of intangible assets to determine the amount of acquisition-related intangible asset amortization expense to record in future periods. We periodically review the estimated useful lives assigned to our intangible assets to determine whether such estimated useful lives continue to be appropriate. Goodwill and Acquired Intangible Assets We review the carrying value of goodwill for impairment annually and whenever events or changes in circumstances indicate the carrying value may not be recoverable. In 2011, we early adopted guidance from the Financial Accounting Standards Board related to the assessment of qualitative factors in evaluating goodwill for impairment. The adoption of this guidance did not impact our consolidated financial statements. When reviewing goodwill for impairment, we first assess numerous qualitative factors to determine whether it is more likely than not that the fair value of our reporting units are less than their respective carrying values. Examples of qualitative factors that we assess include our share price, our financial performance, market and competitive factors in our industry and other events specific to our reporting units. If it is concluded that it is more likely than not that the fair value of a reporting unit is less than its carrying value, then we perform a quantitative two-step goodwill impairment test. The first step in this test is to compare the fair value of the reporting unit to its carrying value. We determine the fair value of a reporting unit based on the present value of estimated future cash flows. If the fair value of the reporting unit exceeds the carrying value of the unit net assets, goodwill of that reporting unit is not impaired and further testing is not required. If the carrying value of the reporting unit net assets exceeds the fair value of the unit, then we perform the second step of the impairment test to determine the implied fair value of the reporting unit goodwill and any impairment charge. Determining the fair value of a reporting unit involves judgment and the use of significant estimates and assumptions, which include assumptions regarding the revenue growth rates and operating margins used to calculate estimated future cash flows, risk-adjusted discount rates and future economic and market conditions. Our most recent impairment assessment in the fourth quarter of 2011 determined that our goodwill was not impaired. Based on the most recent fair value estimates, the fair value of each of our reporting units exceeded its carrying value by a substantial margin. We review acquired intangible assets for impairment whenever events or changes in circumstances indicate the carrying amount of the asset may not be recoverable. Recoverability is assessed by comparing the carrying amount of the asset to the undiscounted future cash flows expected to be generated by the asset. Measurement of any impairment loss is based on estimated fair value. Given the significance of our goodwill and intangible asset balances, an adverse change in fair value could result in an impairment charge, which could be material to our consolidated financial statements. Based on our impairment assessments in 2011, we determined that our acquired intangible assets were not impaired. Revenue Recognition The majority of our revenue is generated from monthly account- and transaction-based fees. Deferred revenue consists primarily of advance billings for services. Revenue is recognized as services are provided. Revenue is primarily recognized under service agreements that are long-term in nature, generally three to five years, and that do not require management to make significant judgments or assumptions. Given the nature of our business and the rules governing revenue recognition, our revenue recognition practices do not involve significant estimates that materially affect our results of operations. Additional information about our revenue recognition policies is included in Note 1 to the consolidated financial statements. 22 Table of Contents Other We do not participate in, nor have we created, any off-balance sheet variable interest entities or other off-balance sheet financing, other than letters of credit. We use derivative financial instruments for managing our exposure to changes in interest rates, managing our ratio of fixed to floating-rate debt and foreign exchange rate risks. We do not enter into any derivative financial instruments for speculative purposes. Results of Operations Components of Revenue and Expenses The following summary describes the components of revenue and expenses as presented in our consolidated statements of income. A description of our revenue recognition policies is included in Note 1 to the consolidated financial statements. Processing and Services Processing and services revenue, which in 2011 represented 82% of our consolidated revenue, is primarily generated from account- and transaction-based fees under contracts that generally have terms of three to five years. Revenue is recognized when the related transactions are processed and services have been performed. Processing and services revenue is most reflective of our business performance because a significant amount of our total operating profit is generated by these services. Cost of processing and services includes costs directly associated with providing services to clients and includes the following: personnel; equipment and data communication; infrastructure costs, including costs to maintain software applications; client support; depreciation and amortization; and other operating expenses. Product Product revenue, which in 2011 represented 18% of our consolidated revenue, is derived from integrated print and card production (13%) and software licenses (5%). Cost of product includes costs directly associated with the products sold and includes the following: costs of materials and software development; personnel; infrastructure costs; depreciation and amortization; and other costs directly associated with product revenue. Selling, General and Administrative Expenses Selling, general and administrative expenses primarily consist of: salaries, wages and related expenses paid to sales personnel, administrative employees, and management; advertising and promotional costs; depreciation and amortization; and other selling and administrative expenses. 23 Table of Contents Financial Results The following table presents certain amounts included in our consolidated statements of income, the relative percentage that those amounts represent to revenue and the change in those amounts from year to year. This information should be read together with the consolidated financial statements and accompanying notes.

Total Revenue Total revenue increased $204 million, or 5%, in 2011 and increased $56 million, or 1%, in 2010 compared to the prior years. The increase in total revenue during 2011 was primarily due to 8% revenue growth in our Payments segment and 3% revenue growth in our Financial segment, in each case, as compared to 2010. The increase in total revenue during 2010 was primarily due to 2% revenue growth in our Payments segment as compared to 2009. Revenue from acquired companies contributed $30 million and $3 million to revenue in 2011 and 2010, respectively. Revenue in our Payments segment increased $173 million, or 8%, in 2011 and increased $48 million, or 2%, in 2010 compared to the prior years. Revenue from acquired companies totaled $26 million and positively impacted revenue growth by approximately one percentage point in 2011. Revenue growth in our Payments segment during 2011 and 2010 was primarily driven by our recurring revenue businesses as processing and services revenue increased $99 million, or 6%, and $58 million, or 4%, in 2011 and 2010, respectively. The growth in both years was primarily due to new clients and increased transaction volumes from existing clients in our electronic payments businesses, including our electronic banking and card services businesses. In addition, higher postage pass-through revenue, which is included in both product revenue and cost of product, in our output solutions business contributed approximately three percentage points of growth in this segment in 2011. In 2010, Payments segment revenue growth of 2% was negatively impacted by lower product revenue in our output solutions business, which decreased $10 million, or 2%, as compared to 2009. 25 Table of Contents Revenue in our Financial segment increased $53 million, or 3%, in 2011 and increased $9 million, or 0.5%, in 2010 compared to the prior years. Revenue growth in our Financial segment was favorably impacted by increases of $42 million and $31 million, or 2% in each of 2011 and 2010, in processing and services revenue due primarily to increased revenue in our bank and credit union account processing businesses and, in 2010, by higher contract termination fee revenue. Revenue growth was negatively impacted by volume declines in our check processing business in 2011 and 2010. In 2011, Financial segment revenue growth was favorably impacted by an $11 million increase in product revenue, primarily due to higher software license revenue, and in 2010, product revenue was negatively impacted by a decline in software license revenue compared to the prior year periods. Total Expenses Total expenses increased $215 million, or 7%, in 2011 compared to 2010 and decreased $5 million, or 0.2%, in 2010 compared to 2009. Total expenses as a percentage of total revenue were 77.0%, 75.6% and 76.8% in 2011, 2010 and 2009, respectively. Cost of processing and services as a percentage of processing and services revenue increased to 54.8% in 2011 and decreased to 54.3% in 2010 from 55.4% in 2009. In 2011 and 2010, cost of processing and services as a percentage of processing and services revenue was favorably impacted by increased operating leverage in our recurring revenue businesses, operating efficiency initiatives across the company, and the implementation of strategic initiatives that lowered our overall cost structure. In 2011, cost of processing and services as a percentage of processing and services revenue was negatively impacted by increased expenses associated with the development and support of new and existing products and services and increased employee compensation costs. These new products and services include Mobiliti for mobile banking and payments services and Acumen, our next generation account processing platform for large credit unions. Cost of product as a percentage of product revenue was 75.7% in 2011 compared to 74.2% in 2010 and 71.7% in 2009. The increase in cost of product in 2011 was primarily due to an increase in postage pass-through revenue and expenses in our output solutions business. Cost of product was relatively unchanged in 2010 compared to 2009. Cost of product as a percentage of product revenue, however, increased in 2010 due primarily to a decline in higher-margin software license revenue. Selling, general and administrative expenses increased $59 million, or 8%, and decreased $11 million, or 1%, in 2011 and 2010, respectively, compared to the prior years. The increase in selling, general and administrative expenses in 2011 compared to 2010 was primarily in our Corporate and Other segment due to $18 million of employee severance expenses, increased employee compensation and commission costs totaling $15 million, and higher merger and integration costs of $12 million. The decrease in selling, general and administrative expenses in 2010 compared to 2009 was primarily due to lower employee severance expenses and a $5 million gain on the sale of a facility which reduced expenses in 2010. Operating Income and Operating Margin Total operating income decreased $11 million, or 1%, in 2011 and increased $61 million, or 6%, in 2010 compared to the prior years. Operating income in 2011 was negatively impacted by higher expenses in our Corporate and Other segment and favorably impacted by operating income growth of 5% and 4% in our Payments and Financial segments, respectively. Operating margin decreased to 23.0% in 2011 from 24.4% in 2010 and increased in 2010 from 23.2% in 2009. The operating margin decline of 140 basis points in 2011 was primarily due to increased operating losses in our Corporate and Other segment. The operating margin improvement of 120 basis points in 2010 was due in part to operational effectiveness activities and the implementation of strategic initiatives that lowered our overall cost structure. Operating income in our Payments segment increased $31 million, or 5%, and $8 million, or 1%, in 2011 and 2010, respectively, compared to the prior years. Operating margins were 27.5%, 28.3% and 28.6% in 2011, 2010 26 Table of Contents and 2009, respectively, and decreased 80 basis points in 2011 and 30 basis points in 2010. Payments segment operating income in 2011 and 2010 was favorably impacted by improved revenue growth and increased operating leverage and scale efficiencies in our electronic payments businesses. Operating margins in 2011 and 2010 were negatively impacted by increased expenses associated with the development and support of new and existing products and services. In addition, operating margin in the Payments segment in 2011 was negatively impacted by approximately 80 basis points due to increased postage pass-through costs, which are included in both revenue and expenses. Operating income in our Financial segment increased $22 million, or 4%, in each of 2011 and 2010 compared to the prior years. Operating margins improved in both years and were 30.6%, 30.3% and 29.3% in 2011, 2010 and 2009, respectively. These improvements in operating income and operating margin were primarily due to improved revenue growth and cost efficiencies in our bank and credit union account and item processing businesses. In addition, in 2011, operating income and operating margin were positively impacted by higher software license revenue and negatively impacted by increased expenses associated with our new Acumen account processing platform. In 2010, operating income and margins were positively impacted by an increase in higher-margin contract termination fee revenue and negatively impacted by a decrease in higher-margin software license revenue. The operating loss in our Corporate and Other segment increased $64 million in 2011 and decreased $31 million in 2010 compared to the prior years. The operating loss increase in 2011 was primarily due to employee severance costs of $18 million, higher merger and integration costs of $17 million, a $9 million increase in amortization of acquisition-related intangible assets and a $5 million gain on the sale of a facility recorded in 2010. The operating loss decrease in 2010 compared to 2009 was primarily due to a $21 million decrease in employee severance expenses and lower merger and integration costs associated with our acquisition of CheckFree Corporation ( CheckFree ). Interest Expense Interest expense decreased $10 million, or 5%, and $22 million, or 10%, in 2011 and 2010, respectively, compared to the prior years. These decreases were primarily due to lower average interest rates in 2011 and 2010 as compared to the prior years and, in 2010, a reduction in average outstanding borrowings as compared to 2009. Loss on Early Debt Extinguishment In June 2011, we purchased $700 million aggregate principal amount of our 6.125% senior notes due in November 2012 in a tender offer for $754 million, and in July 2011, we redeemed the remaining $300 million aggregate principal amount of these notes for $322 million. In October 2010, we purchased $250 million aggregate principal amount of our 6.125% senior notes due in November 2012 for $276 million. We recorded pre-tax losses on early debt extinguishment for the premiums paid and other costs associated with these transactions of $85 million in 2011 and $26 million in 2010. Income Tax Provision Our effective income tax rate for continuing operations was 35.1% in 2011, 38.0% in 2010 and 37.2% in 2009. The lower effective tax rate in 2011 compared to 2010 was primarily due to the resolution of tax audits and changes in state tax laws. The higher effective tax rate in 2010 compared to 2009 was primarily due to a tax benefit recognized in 2009 in connection with the final settlement of a CheckFree purchase accounting income tax reserve. Income from Investment in Unconsolidated Affiliate Our 49% share of the income of StoneRiver Group, L.P. ( StoneRiver ) was $18 million, $14 million and $12 million in 2011, 2010 and 2009, respectively. In 2011, the $4 million increase in income was primarily due to a $3 million gain on the sale of a business by StoneRiver. 27 Table of Contents Income (Loss) from Discontinued Operations Income (loss) from discontinued operations totaled $(19) million, $(10) million and $3 million in 2011, 2010 and 2009, respectively. In 2009, we recognized a $25 million after-tax gain from the sale of a business. Net Income Per Share - Diluted from Continuing Operations Net income per share-diluted from continuing operations was $3.40 in 2011 compared to $3.34 in 2010 and $3.04 in 2009. Net income per share-diluted from continuing operations was negatively impacted by losses on early debt extinguishment of $0.37 per share and $0.11 per share in 2011 and 2010, respectively. In addition, net income per share-diluted from continuing operations was negatively impacted in 2011 by $0.08 per share due to employee severance expenses. The amortization of acquisition-related intangible assets also reduced net income per share-diluted from continuing operations by $0.69, $0.60 and $0.58 in 2011, 2010 and 2009, respectively. Liquidity and Capital Resources Our primary liquidity needs are: (i) to fund normal operating expenses; (ii) to meet the principal and interest requirements of our outstanding indebtedness; and (iii) to fund capital expenditures and operating lease payments. We believe these needs will be satisfied using our cash flow generated by operations, our cash and cash equivalents at December 31, 2011 of $337 million, and available borrowings under our revolving credit facility. Years Ended December 31, Increase (Decrease) (In millions) 2011 2010 $ % Income from continuing operations $ 491 $ 506 $ (15 ) Depreciation and amortization 349 339 10 Share-based compensation 39 39 - Loss on early debt extinguishment 85 26 59 Dividend from unconsolidated affiliate 12 40 (28 ) Working capital (20 ) (8 ) (12 ) Other (3 ) 16 (19 ) Operating cash flow $ 953 $ 958 $ (5 ) (1 %) Capital expenditures $ 192 $ 175 $ 17 10 % Our net cash provided by operating activities from continuing operations, or operating cash flow, decreased $5 million, or 1%, to $953 million in 2011 from $958 million in 2010. In 2011, our operating cash flow was negatively impacted by a $28 million decrease in the portion of StoneRiver dividends that are included in operating cash flow and a $12 million increase in working capital compared to 2010. Our current policy is to use our operating cash flow to repay debt and to fund capital expenditures, acquisitions and share repurchases, rather than to pay dividends. Our capital expenditures of $192 million and $175 million in 2011 and 2010, respectively, were less than 5% of our total revenue in each year. The $17 million increase in capital expenditures in 2011 was primarily due to equipment purchases associated with a new data center. In 2011, we acquired CashEdge, M-Com, and two other companies for an aggregate purchase price of $511 million, net of cash acquired. In 2011 and 2010, we received cash dividends of $54 million and $61 million, respectively, from StoneRiver.

At December 31, 2011, our long-term debt consisted primarily of $1.1 billion senior term loan borrowings and $2.25 billion of senior notes. We were in compliance with all financial debt covenants in 2011. Senior Term Loan We maintain an unsecured senior term loan facility with a syndicate of banks. Term loan borrowings under this facility bear interest at a variable rate based on LIBOR plus a specified margin or the bank base rate and mature in November 2012. The weighted-average variable interest rate on the term loan borrowings was 1.0% at December 31, 2011. The term loan facility contains various restrictions and covenants substantially similar to those contained in the revolving credit facility described below. At December 31, 2011, a portion of our term loan borrowings, $925 million, was classified in our consolidated balance sheet as long-term debt because we have the intent to refinance this debt on a long-term basis and could do so under our revolving credit facility that expires in 2014. Senior Notes In June 2011, we issued $1.0 billion of senior notes comprised of $600 million of 3.125% senior notes due in June 2016 and $400 million of 4.75% senior notes due in June 2021, which pay interest semi-annually on June 15 and December 15 of each year. In September 2010, we issued $300 million of 3.125% senior notes due in October 2015 and $450 million of 4.625% senior notes due in October 2020, which pay interest semi-annually on April 1 and October 1 of each year. Our 6.8% senior notes due in November 2017 pay interest at the stated rate on May 20 and November 20 of each year. The interest rates applicable to the senior notes are subject to an increase of up to two percent in the event that our credit rating is downgraded below investment grade. The indenture governing the senior notes contains covenants that, among other matters, limit: our ability to consolidate or merge into, or convey, transfer or lease all or substantially all of our properties and assets to, another person; our and certain of our subsidiaries ability to create or assume liens; and our and certain of our subsidiaries ability to engage in sale and leaseback transactions. 29 Table of Contents In June 2011, we purchased $700 million aggregate principal amount of our 6.125% senior notes due in November 2012 in a tender offer for $754 million, and in July 2011, we redeemed the remaining $300 million aggregate principal amount of these notes for $322 million. Revolving Credit Facility We maintain a $1.0 billion revolving credit facility with a syndicate of banks. Borrowings under this facility bear interest at a variable rate based on LIBOR plus a specified margin or the bank base rate (2.3% at December 31, 2011). There are no significant commitment fees and no compensating balance requirements. The facility expires in September 2014. As of December 31, 2011, there were letters of credit totaling $28 million and no borrowings outstanding under the facility. The revolving credit facility contains various restrictions and covenants that require us, among other things, to (i) limit our consolidated indebtedness to no more than three and one-half times consolidated net earnings before interest, taxes, depreciation and amortization and certain other adjustments and (ii) maintain consolidated net earnings before interest, taxes, depreciation and amortization and certain other adjustments of at least three times consolidated interest expense. Interest Rate Hedge Contracts We maintain interest rate swap agreements ( Swaps ) with total notional values of $1.0 billion to hedge against changes in interest rates and forward-starting interest rate swap agreements ( Forward-Starting Swaps ) with total notional values of $550 million to hedge against changes in interest rates applicable to forecasted fixed rate borrowings. The Swaps and Forward-Starting Swaps expire in September 2012 and have been designated by us as cash flow hedges. The Swaps effectively fix the interest rates on floating rate term loan borrowings at a weighted-average rate of approximately 5.0%, prior to financing spreads and related fees. The Forward-Starting Swaps effectively fix the benchmark interest rate on forecasted five-year and ten-year borrowings at weighted-average rates of approximately 3.2% and 3.9%, respectively. Shelf Registration Statement In 2010, we filed a shelf registration statement with the Securities and Exchange Commission. Under the registration statement, we may sell common stock, preferred stock and debt securities, or a combination thereof. Each time we sell securities pursuant to the shelf registration statement, we will provide a prospectus supplement that will contain specific information about the terms of the securities being offered and of the offering. We may offer and sell the securities pursuant to this prospectus from time to time in one or more of the following ways: through underwriters or dealers, through agents, directly to purchasers or through a combination of any of these methods of sales. Proceeds from the sale of these securities may be used to repay debt or for working capital, acquisitions or general corporate purposes. Other Access to capital markets impacts our cost of capital, our ability to refinance maturing debt and our ability to fund future acquisitions. Our ability to access capital on favorable terms depends on a number of factors, including general market conditions, interest rates, credit ratings on our debt securities, perception of our potential future earnings and the market price of our common stock. As of December 31, 2011, we had a credit rating of Baa2 with a stable outlook from Moody Investors Service, Inc. ( Moody ) and BBB- with a stable outlook from Standard & Poor Ratings Services ( S&P ) on our senior unsecured debt securities. The interest rate payable on our senior notes is subject to adjustment from time to time if Moody or S&P downgrades (or subsequently upgrades) the debt rating applicable to the notes. If the ratings from Moody or S&P decrease below investment grade, the per annum interest rate on the notes is subject to increase by up to 2.0%. In no event will the per annum interest rate be reduced below the original interest rate applicable to the senior notes nor will the total increase in the per annum interest rate exceed 2.0% above the original interest rate. 30 Table of Contents Off-Balance Sheet Arrangements and Contractual Obligations We do not have any off-balance sheet arrangements other than letters of credit.
