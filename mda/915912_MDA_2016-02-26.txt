ITEM 7. MANAGEMENT'S DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS OF FINANCIAL CONDITION AND RESULTS OF OPERATIONS Management's Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations ("MD&A") is intended to help provide an understanding of our business, financial condition and results of operations. This MD&A should be read in conjunction with our Consolidated Financial Statements and the accompanying Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements included elsewhere in this report. This report, including the following MD&A, contains forward-looking statements regarding future events or trends that should be read in conjunction with the factors described under "Forward-Looking Statements" included in this report. Actual results or developments could differ materially from those projected in such statements as a result of the factors described under "Forward-Looking Statements" as well as the risk factors described in Item 1A. "Risk Factors" of this report. Capitalized terms used without definition have the meanings provided elsewhere in this Form 10-K. Executive Overview Business Description We develop, redevelop, acquire, own and operate multifamily apartment communities primarily in New England, the New York/New Jersey metro area, the Mid-Atlantic, the Pacific Northwest, and Northern and Southern California. We focus on leading metropolitan areas that we believe are characterized by growing employment in high wage sectors of the economy, lower housing affordability and a diverse and vibrant quality of life. We believe these market characteristics offer the opportunity for superior risk-adjusted returns on apartment community investment relative to other markets. We seek to create long-term shareholder value by accessing capital on cost effective terms; deploying that capital to develop, redevelop and acquire apartment communities in our selected markets; operating apartment communities; and selling communities when they no longer meet our long-term investment strategy or when pricing is attractive. Our strategic vision is to be the leading apartment company in select US markets, providing a range of distinctive living experiences that customers value. We pursue this vision by targeting what we believe are the best markets and submarkets, leveraging our strategic capabilities in market research and consumer insight and being disciplined in our capital allocation and balance sheet management. Our communities are predominately upscale and generally command among the highest rents in their markets. However, we also pursue the ownership and operation of apartment communities that target a variety of customer segments and price points, consistent with our goal of offering a broad range of products and services. We regularly evaluate the allocation of our investments by the amount of invested capital and by product type within our individual markets. Financial Highlights For the year ended December 31, 2015 , net income attributable to common stockholders was $742,038,000 , an increase of $58,471,000 , or 8.6% , over the prior year. The increase is primarily attributable to an increase in NOI from newly developed and existing operating communities, and gains from net insurance recoveries and the extinguishment of debt, partially offset by a decrease in equity in income of unconsolidated real estate entities For the year ended December 31, 2015 , Established Communities NOI increased by $53,656,000 , or 5.8% , over the prior year. The increase was driven by an increase in rental revenue of 5.0% , partially offset by an increase in operating expenses of 3.0% over 2014 . During 2015 , we raised approximately $1,823,743,000 of gross capital through the issuance of unsecured notes, settlement of the forward equity contract to sell 4,500,000 shares of common stock at a weighted average sales price of $146.54 per share, borrowing the final $50,000,000 available under the Term Loan and asset sales, exclusive of proceeds from the disposition of joint ventures. The funds raised from asset sales consist of the proceeds from the sale of three communities, two undeveloped land parcels and air rights, for gross sales proceeds of $289,320,000 . We believe that our current capital structure will continue to provide financial flexibility to access capital on attractive terms. We believe our development activity will continue to create long-term value. During 2015 , we completed the development of 13 communities for an aggregate total capitalized cost of $1,312,700,000 . We also started the development of 13 communities, which are expected to be completed for an estimated total capitalized cost of $1,191,500,000 . In addition, during 2015 we completed the redevelopment of four communities for a total investment of $59,600,000 , excluding costs incurred prior to the redevelopment. 43 Table of Contents We believe that our balance sheet strength, as measured by our current level of indebtedness, our current ability to service interest and other fixed charges, and our current moderate use of financial encumbrances (such as secured financing) provide us with adequate access to liquidity from the capital markets. We expect to be able to meet our reasonably foreseeable liquidity needs, as they arise, through a combination of one or more of the following sources: existing cash on hand; operating cash flows; borrowings under our Credit Facility; secured debt; the issuance of corporate securities (which could include unsecured debt, preferred equity and/or common equity); the sale of apartment communities; or through the formation of joint ventures. See the discussion under Liquidity and Capital Resources. During the year ended December 31, 2015 , we sold three communities, containing an aggregate of 851 apartment homes for an aggregate gross sales price of $265,500,000 and an aggregate gain in accordance with GAAP of $115,625,000 . We also sold two undeveloped land parcels and air rights, representing the right to increase density for future residential development, for $23,820,000 , resulting in a gain in accordance with GAAP of $9,647,000 . Communities Overview As of December 31, 2015 we owned or held a direct or indirect ownership interest in 285 apartment communities containing 83,696 apartment homes in 11 states and the District of Columbia, of which 26 communities were under construction and nine communities were under reconstruction. Of these communities, 20 were owned by entities that were not consolidated for financial reporting purposes, including six owned by subsidiaries of Fund II and nine owned by the U.S. Fund. In addition, we owned a direct or indirect ownership interest in Development Rights to develop an additional 32 wholly-owned communities that, if developed as expected, will contain an estimated 9,634 apartment homes. Our real estate investments consist primarily of current operating apartment communities, Development Communities and Development Rights. Our current operating communities are further distinguished as Established Communities, Other Stabilized Communities, Lease-Up Communities and Redevelopment Communities. Established Communities are generally operating communities that are consolidated for financial reporting purposes and were owned and had stabilized occupancy and operating expenses as of the beginning of the prior year, which allows the performance of these communities to be compared between years. Other Stabilized Communities are generally all other consolidated operating communities that have stabilized occupancy and operating expenses during the current year, but had not achieved stabilization as of the beginning of the prior year. Lease-Up Communities consist of communities where construction is complete but stabilization has not been achieved. Redevelopment Communities consist of communities where substantial redevelopment is in progress or is planned to begin during the current year. A more detailed description of our reportable segments and other related operating information can be found in Note 8, "Segment Reporting," of our Consolidated Financial Statements. Although each of these categories is important to our business, we generally evaluate overall operating, industry and market trends based on the operating results of Established Communities, for which a detailed discussion can be found in "Results of Operations" as part of our discussion of overall operating results. We evaluate our current and future cash needs and future operating potential based on acquisition, disposition, development, redevelopment and financing activities within Other Stabilized, Redevelopment and Development Communities. Discussions related to current and future cash needs and financing activities can be found in "Liquidity and Capital Resources." NOI of our current operating communities is one of the financial measures that we use to evaluate community performance. NOI is affected by the demand and supply dynamics within our markets, our rental rates and occupancy levels and our ability to control operating costs. Our overall financial performance is also impacted by the general availability and cost of capital and the performance of newly developed, redeveloped and acquired apartment communities. 44 Table of Contents Results of Operations Our year-over-year operating performance is primarily affected by both overall and individual geographic market conditions and apartment fundamentals and is reflected in changes in NOI of our Established Communities; NOI derived from acquisitions and development completions; the loss of NOI related to disposed communities; and capital market and financing activity.

Net income attributable to common stockholders increased $330,426,000 , or 93.6% , in 2014 from 2013 primarily due to an increase in income from unconsolidated real estate entities resulting from the gains on sales of communities in various ventures, including the Company promoted interests, increased NOI from newly developed and acquired communities, losses on an interest rate contract in the prior year not present in 2014, a decrease in expensed acquisition costs related to the Archstone Acquisition and a decrease in depreciation expense related to in-place leases acquired as part of the Archstone Acquisition. NOI is considered by management to be an important and appropriate supplemental performance measure to net income because it helps both investors and management to understand the core operations of a community or communities prior to the allocation of any corporate-level or financing-related costs. NOI reflects the operating performance of a community and allows for an easy comparison of the operating performance of individual assets or groups of assets. In addition, because prospective buyers of real estate have different financing and overhead structures, with varying marginal impacts to overhead as a result of acquiring real estate, NOI is considered by many in the real estate industry to be a useful measure for determining the value of a real estate asset or group of assets. We define NOI as total property revenue less direct property operating expenses, including property taxes, and excluding corporate-level income (including management, development and other fees), corporate-level property management and other indirect operating expenses, investments and investment management expenses, expensed acquisition, development and other pursuit costs, net interest expense, gain (loss) on extinguishment of debt, loss on interest rate contract, general and administrative expense, joint venture income (loss), depreciation expense, corporate income tax expense, casualty (gain) loss and impairment loss, net, gain on sale of real estate assets, gain on sale of discontinued operations, income from discontinued operations and net operating income from real estate assets sold or held for sale, not classified as discontinued operations. NOI does not represent cash generated from operating activities in accordance with GAAP. Therefore, NOI should not be considered an alternative to net income as an indication of our performance. NOI should also not be considered an alternative to net cash flow from operating activities, as determined by GAAP, as a measure of liquidity, nor is NOI indicative of cash available to fund cash needs. Reconciliations of NOI for the years ended December 31, 2015 , 2014 and 2013 to net income for each year are as follows (dollars in thousands): For the year ended 12/31/15 12/31/14 12/31/13 Net income $ 741,733 $ 697,327 $ 352,771 Indirect operating expenses, net of corporate income 56,973 49,055 41,554 Investments and investment management expense 4,370 4,485 3,990 Expensed acquisition, development and other pursuit costs, net of recoveries 6,822 (3,717 ) 45,050 Interest expense, net (1) 175,615 180,618 172,402 (Gain) loss on extinguishment of debt, net (26,736 ) 412 14,921 Loss on interest rate contract 51,000 General and administrative expense 42,396 41,425 39,573 Equity in (income) loss of unconsolidated real estate entities (70,018 ) (148,766 ) 11,154 Depreciation expense (1) 477,923 442,682 560,215 Income tax expense 1,861 9,368 Casualty (gain) loss and impairment loss, net (10,542 ) Gain on sale of real estate assets (125,272 ) (85,415 ) (240 ) Gain on sale of discontinued operations (37,869 ) (278,231 ) Income from discontinued operations (310 ) (16,713 ) Net operating income from real estate assets sold or held for sale, not classified as discontinued operations (10,920 ) (27,357 ) (31,388 ) Net operating income $ 1,264,205 $ 1,121,938 $ 966,058 _________________________________ (1) Includes amounts associated with assets sold or held for sale, not classified as discontinued operations. The NOI increases for both 2015 and 2014 , as compared to the prior year, consist of changes in the following categories (dollars in thousands): 46 Table of Contents Full Year 2015 2014 Established Communities $ 53,656 $ 22,728 Other Stabilized Communities 28,129 74,322 Development and Redevelopment Communities 60,482 58,830 Total $ 142,267 $ 155,880 The increase in our Established Communities' NOI in 2015 and 2014 is due to increased rental rates, partially offset by decreased economic occupancy and increased operating expenses. Rental and other income increased in both 2015 and 2014 compared to the prior years due to additional rental income generated from newly developed and existing operating communities and an increase in rental rates at our Established Communities. Overall Portfolio The weighted average number of occupied apartment homes for consolidated communities increased to 64,211 apartment homes for 2015 , as compared to 61,686 homes for 2014 and 57,240 homes for 2013 . The weighted average monthly revenue per occupied apartment home increased to $2,388 for 2015 as compared to $2,254 in 2014 and $2,171 in 2013 . Established Communities Rental revenue increased $66,136,000 , or 5.0% , to $1,382,895,000 for 2015 from $1,316,759,000 in the prior year. The increase is due to an increase in average rental rates of 5.3% to $2,358 per apartment home, partially offset by a decrease in economic occupancy of 0.3% to 95.6% . Rental revenue increased $36,096,000 , or 3.9% , for 2014 , as compared to the prior year. Economic occupancy takes into account the fact that apartment homes of different sizes and locations within a community have different economic impacts on a community's gross revenue. Economic occupancy is defined as gross potential revenue less vacancy loss, as a percentage of gross potential revenue. Gross potential revenue is determined by valuing occupied homes at leased rates and vacant homes at market rents. We experienced increases in rental revenue for all of our Established Communities' regions in 2015 as compared to the prior year, as discussed in more detail below. The Metro New York/New Jersey region accounted for approximately 27.6% of the Established Community rental revenue for 2015 and experienced a rental revenue increase of 3.4% for 2015 over the prior year. Average rental rates increased 4.0% to $2,928 per apartment home, and were partially offset by a 0.6% decrease in economic occupancy to 95.6% for 2015 as compared to 2014 . While New York City is absorbing a larger pipeline of new apartment deliveries, suburban markets surrounding the city are more insulated from this new competition, and we expect to see continued growth over the prior year in the Metro New York/New Jersey region in 2016. The Northern California region accounted for approximately 19.8% of the Established Community rental revenue for 2015 and experienced a rental revenue increase of 9.5% for 2015 over the prior year. Average rental rates increased 10.4% to $2,593 per apartment home, and were partially offset by a 0.9% decrease in economic occupancy to 95.4% for 2015 as compared to 2014 . Although we project job growth to moderate and new apartment deliveries to remain elevated, we expect the Northern California region will continue to produce strong revenue growth in 2016. The Southern California region accounted for approximately 18.2% of the Established Community rental revenue for 2015 and experienced a rental revenue increase of 6.3% for 2015 over the prior year. Average rental rates increased 6.5% to $1,984 per apartment home, and were partially offset by a 0.2% decrease in economic occupancy to 95.8% for 2015 as compared to 2014 . Southern California has seen steady job growth and limited new apartment supply, which we expect will continue to support favorable operating results during 2016. The Mid-Atlantic region accounted for approximately 15.1% of the Established Community rental revenue for 2015 and experienced a rental revenue increase of 0.8% for 2015 over the prior year. Average rental rates increased 0.5% to $2,070 per apartment home, and economic occupancy increased 0.3% to 95.6% for 2015 as compared to 2014 . Although new apartment supply will remain elevated, accelerating job growth is expected to support continued modest growth in 2016. The New England region accounted for approximately 13.8% of the Established Community rental revenue for 2015 and experienced a rental revenue increase of 4.5% for 2015 over the prior year. Average rental rates increased 4.1% to $2,283 per apartment home, and economic occupancy increased 0.4% to 95.7% for 2015 as compared to 2014 . Stable job growth in the Boston metro area is expected to support healthy apartment demand in 2016. The Fairfield market continues to experience moderate economic growth due to the area greater exposure to the financial services sector, which has experienced slower job growth during this recovery than other industries. 47 Table of Contents The Pacific Northwest region accounted for approximately 5.5% of the Established Community rental revenue for 2015 and experienced a rental revenue increase of 7.1% for 2015 over the prior year. Average rental rates increased 7.3% to $1,945 per apartment home, and were partially offset by a 0.2% decrease in economic occupancy to 95.1% for 2015 as compared to 2014 . We believe that healthy rental revenue growth will continue in 2016, although it may be tempered by the delivery of new apartment homes. Management, development and other fees decreased $1,103,000 or 10.0% , and $452,000 , or 3.9% , in 2015 and 2014 , respectively, as compared to the prior years. The decrease in 2015 was primarily due to lower property and asset management fees earned as a result of dispositions from Fund I and Fund II, partially offset by an increase in disposition fees in 2015 related to the sale of communities owned within the Residual JV. The decrease in 2014 was primarily due to lower property and asset management fees earned as a result of dispositions from Fund I and Fund II, partially offset by increased property and asset management fees related to the Archstone Acquisition for related private real estate investment management funds (the U.S. Fund and the AC JV). Direct property operating expenses, excluding property taxes increased $31,471,000 , or 9.1% , and $50,696,000 , or 17.2% , in 2015 and 2014 , respectively, as compared to the prior years. The increases in 2015 and 2014 were primarily due to the addition of newly developed and acquired apartment communities. The increase in 2015 was also due to snow removal and other costs related to the severe winter storms in our Northeast markets during the first quarter of 2015. For Established Communities, direct property operating expenses, excluding property taxes, increased $8,207,000 , or 3.1% , and $7,475,000 , or 4.0% , in 2015 and 2014 , respectively, as compared to the prior years. The increase in 2015 was primarily due to increased repairs and maintenance costs, payroll and benefit costs, and insurance costs, as well as snow removal and other costs related to the severe winter storms in our Northeast markets during the first quarter of 2015. The increase in 2014 was primarily due to increased repairs and maintenance, utilities and payroll costs. Property taxes increased $14,865,000 , or 8.3% , and $19,860,000 , or 12.5% , in 2015 and 2014 , respectively, as compared to the prior years. The increases in 2015 and 2014 were primarily due to the addition of newly developed apartment communities, coupled with increased tax rates and assessments across our portfolio. The increase in 2015 was also due to successful appeals and reductions of supplemental taxes in the prior year in excess of the current year. The increase in 2014 was partially offset by reductions in expected supplemental billings related to communities acquired as part of the Archstone Acquisition. For Established Communities, property taxes increased $3,829,000 , or 2.8% , and $6,206,000 , or 6.7% , in 2015 and 2014 , respectively, as compared to the prior years. The increase in 2015 was primarily due to successful appeals and reductions of supplemental taxes in the prior year period in excess of the current year, related primarily to the Company West Coast markets. The increase in 2014 was primarily due to higher rates and assessments, as well as refunds received in the prior year in excess of the current year period. For communities in California, property tax changes are determined by the change in the California Consumer Price Index, with increases limited by law (Proposition 13). Massachusetts also has laws in place to limit property tax increases. We evaluate property tax increases internally and also engage third-party consultants to assist in our evaluations. We appeal property tax increases when appropriate. Corporate-level property management and other indirect operating expenses increased $6,719,000 , or 11.1% , and $7,236,000 , or 13.6% , in 2015 and 2014 , respectively, as compared to the prior years. The increases in 2015 and 2014 were primarily due to an increase in compensation related costs including certain employee separation costs. The increase in 2014 was also due to increased activities related to re-branding and corporate initiatives, and was also impacted as the first full year of operations following the Archstone Acquisition. Investments and investment management costs decreased $115,000 , or 2.6% , in 2015 and increased by $495,000 , or 12.4% , in 2014 as compared to the prior years. The decrease in 2015 was primarily due to a decline in our investment fund management activity, partially offset by an increase in compensation costs. The increase in 2014 was primarily due to an increase in compensation costs, partially offset by a decline in our investment fund management activity. Expensed acquisition, development and other pursuit costs, net of recoveries primarily reflect the costs incurred related to our asset investment activity, abandoned pursuit costs, which include costs incurred for development pursuits not yet considered probable for development, as well as the abandonment of Development Rights, acquisition pursuits and disposition pursuits, offset by any recoveries associated with acquisitions for periods prior to our ownership. These costs can be volatile, particularly in periods of increased acquisition activity, periods of economic downturn or when there is limited access to capital, and the costs may vary significantly from period to period. These costs increased $10,539,000 in 2015 and decreased $48,767,000 in 2014 , as compared to the prior years. The increase in 2015 was primarily due to receipts in 2014 related to communities acquired as part of the Archstone Acquisition for periods prior to the Company ownership, which are primarily comprised of property tax and mortgage insurance refunds, as well as increased costs associated with the acquisition of real estate and abandonment of pursuits, as compared to the prior year. The decrease in 2014 as compared to the prior year was due to the Archstone Acquisition in 2013, as well as 48 Table of Contents receipts in 2014 related to communities acquired as part of the Archstone Acquisition for periods prior to the Company ownership discussed above. Interest expense, net decreased $5,003,000 , or 2.8% , and increased $8,216,000 , or 4.8% , in 2015 and 2014 , respectively, as compared to the prior years. This category includes interest costs offset by capitalized interest pertaining to development and redevelopment activity, amortization of premium/discount on debt, and interest income. The decrease in 2015 was primarily due to the repayment of secured indebtedness in 2015 and increased capitalized interest as a result of our increased development activity, partially offset by an increase in the aggregate principal amount of unsecured debt outstanding resulting from the issuance of $875,000,000 principal amount of indebtedness during the year. The increase in 2014 was primarily due to increased unsecured debt outstanding, partially offset by an increase in capitalized interest related to our increased development activity. (Gain) loss on the extinguishment of debt, net reflects prepayment penalties, the write-off of unamortized deferred financing costs and premiums from our debt repurchase and retirement activity, or payments to acquire our outstanding debt at amounts above or below the carrying basis of the debt acquired, excluding costs related to debt secured by assets sold or held for sale. The gain of $26,736,000 for 2015 was primarily due to the write-off of unamortized mark to market adjustments, net of unamortized deferred financing costs and any applicable related prepayment penalties associated with the early repayment of certain debt assumed as part of the Archstone Acquisition. Loss on interest rate contract reflects the loss recorded by the Company related to the forward interest rate protection agreement that matured in May 2013. Based on changes in the Company's capital markets outlook in 2013, the Company did not issue the anticipated debt for which the interest rate protection agreement was transacted. Depreciation expense increased $35,241,000 , or 8.0% , in 2015 and decreased $117,533,000 , or 21.0% , in 2014 , as compared to the prior years. The increase in 2015 was primarily due to the addition of newly developed apartment communities. The decrease in 2014 was primarily due to the impact of amortization for lease intangibles in 2013 not present in 2014, from communities acquired as part of the Archstone Acquisition. General and administrative expense ("G&A") increased $971,000 , or 2.3% , and $1,852,000 , or 4.7% , in 2015 and 2014 , respectively, as compared to the prior years. The increase in 2015 was primarily due to legal settlement proceeds received in 2014 not present in the current year, partially offset by a decrease in compensation expense, including severance, in 2015 as compared to the prior year. The increase in 2014 was primarily due to an increase in compensation expense, partially offset by legal recoveries in 2014 not present in the prior year. Casualty (gain) loss and impairment loss, net for 2015 consists of Edgewater insurance proceeds received, partially offset by (i) incident and demolition expenses and the write-off of the net book value of the fixed assets destroyed in the fire at Edgewater, (ii) property and casualty damages incurred across several communities in our Northeast markets related to severe winter storms, and (iii) an impairment charge recognized for a parcel of land sold during 2015. Equity in income (loss) of unconsolidated entities decreased by $78,748,000 in 2015 and increased $159,920,000 in 2014 , as compared to the prior years. The decrease in 2015 and increase in 2014 were primarily due to both gains on, and our promoted interests from, the sale of communities in various ventures, including Avalon Chrystie Place, in 2014 in excess of gains on dispositions in 2015. The decrease in 2015 was partially offset by amounts received related to the modification of the joint venture agreement for the entity that owns Avalon at Mission Bay North II to eliminate our promoted interest in future distributions, as well as the settlement of outstanding legal claims and net gains on the sales of communities in various ventures. The increase in 2014 was also due to expensed transaction costs associated with the Archstone Acquisition that were incurred in 2013 through the unconsolidated joint venture entities owned with Equity Residential that were not present in 2014. Gain on sale of real estate increased in 2015 and 2014 as compared to the prior years. The increase in 2015 was a result of the gain on sale of air rights, representing the right to increase density for future residential development, and two undeveloped land parcels. The increase in 2014 was due to changes in volume and associated gains on the sale of land parcels. Gain on sale of communities increased in 2015 and 2014 as compared to the prior years. The amount of gain realized in a given period depends on many factors, including the number of communities sold, the size and carrying value of the communities sold and the market conditions in the local area. Prior to our adoption of ASU 2014-08 as of January 1, 2014, gain on sale of communities was presented in gain on sale of discontinued operations. Income tax expense decreased by $7,507,000 in 2015 and increased by $9,368,000 in 2014 , as compared to the prior years. The decrease in 2015 and increase in 2014 were both primarily due to 2014 federal income tax expense amounts related to dispositions of the Company's direct and indirect interests in certain real estate assets acquired in the Archstone Acquisition, which were owned through a taxable REIT subsidiary. 49 Table of Contents Income from discontinued operations represents the net income generated by real estate sold and qualifying as discontinued operations during the period from January 1, 2013 through December 31, 2015 . Income from discontinued operations decreased in 2015 and 2014 , as compared to the prior years due to the change in accounting guidance for discontinued operations as discussed above. Gain on sale of discontinued operations decreased in 2015 and 2014 , as compared to the prior years. After our adoption of ASU 2014-08 as of January 1, 2014, gain on sale of communities is presented separately from gain on sale of discontinued operations. Net loss (income) attributable to noncontrolling interests resulted in an allocation of loss of $305,000 in 2015 , an allocation of income of $13,760,000 in 2014 and an allocation of loss of $370,000 in 2013 , respectively. The amount for 2014 includes our joint venture partners' 84.8% interest in the gain on the sale of a Fund I community that was consolidated for financial reporting purposes, in the amount of $14,132,000. Liquidity and Capital Resources We employ a disciplined approach to our liquidity and capital management. When we source capital, we take into account both our view of the most cost effective alternative then available and our desire to maintain a balance sheet that provides us with flexibility. Our principal short-term liquidity needs are to fund: development and redevelopment activity in which we are currently engaged; the minimum dividend payments on our common stock required to maintain our REIT qualification under the Code; debt service and principal payments either at maturity or opportunistically before maturity; and normal recurring operating and corporate overhead expenses. Factors affecting our liquidity and capital resources are our cash flows from operations, financing activities and investing activities (including dispositions) as well as general economic and market conditions. Operating cash flow has historically been determined by: (i) the number of apartment homes currently owned, (ii) rental rates, (iii) occupancy levels and (iv) operating expenses with respect to apartment homes. The timing and type of capital markets activity in which we engage, as well as our plans for development, redevelopment, acquisition and disposition activity, are affected by changes in the capital markets environment, such as changes in interest rates or the availability of cost-effective capital. We regularly review our liquidity needs, the adequacy of cash flows from operations and other expected liquidity sources to meet these needs. We had unrestricted cash and cash equivalents of $400,507,000 at December 31, 2015 , a decrease of $108,953,000 from $509,460,000 at December 31, 2014 . The following discussion relates to changes in cash due to operating, investing and financing activities, which are presented in our Consolidated Statements of Cash Flows included elsewhere in this report. Operating Activities Net cash provided by operating activities increased to $1,056,754,000 in 2015 from $886,641,000 in 2014 . The increase was driven primarily by increased NOI from existing and newly developed communities and the timing of payments of corporate obligations. Investing Activities Net cash used in investing activities of $1,199,517,000 in 2015 is related to investments in assets primarily through development and redevelopment, partially offset by proceeds received for dispositions and distributions from unconsolidated joint ventures. In 2015 , we invested $1,625,191,000 in the following areas: we invested approximately $1,569,326,000 in the development and redevelopment of communities including $475,150,000 for the acquisition of direct interests in land for development; and we had capital expenditures of 55,865,000 for our operating communities and non-real estate assets. These amounts are partially offset by: proceeds from dispositions of $282,163,000 ; insurance recoveries for property damage claims related to Edgewater of $44,142,000; and net distributions from unconsolidated joint ventures in the amount of $102,599,000 . Financing Activities Net cash provided by financing activities totaled $33,810,000 in 2015 . The net cash used/provided is primarily due to: proceeds from the issuance of unsecured notes in the aggregate principal amount of $823,088,000; 50 Table of Contents issuance of common stock in the amount of $690,184,000 , including $659,423,000 from the settlement of the Forward, and borrowing the final $50,000,000 available under the $300,000,000 variable rate unsecured term loan (the Term Loan ). These amounts are partially offset by: repayment of secured notes in the amount of $850,963,000 ; payment of cash dividends in the amount of $655,248,000 ; and redemption of preferred interest obligation in the amount of $14,410,000 . Variable Rate Unsecured Credit Facility As of December 31, 2015 , we had a $1,300,000,000 revolving variable rate unsecured credit facility with a syndicate of banks (the "Credit Facility") which was scheduled to mature in April 2017. In January 2016, we extended the maturity of the Credit Facility from April 2017 to April 2020 , and amended other provisions in the Credit Facility. In addition, pursuant to an option available under the terms of the Credit Facility, with the approval of the syndicate of lenders, we increased the aggregate facility size from $1,300,000,000 to $1,500,000,000 (the "Credit Facility Increase"). We may further extend the term for up to nine months, provided we are not in default and upon payment of a $1,500,000 extension fee. In connection with the Credit Facility Increase, the applicable margin over reference rates used to determine the applicable interest rates on our borrowings from time to time decreased. The Credit Facility bears interest at varying levels based on the London Interbank Offered Rate ("LIBOR"), rating levels achieved on our unsecured notes and on a maturity schedule selected by us. The current stated pricing is LIBOR plus 0.825% per annum ( 1.25% at January 31, 2016 assuming a one month borrowing rate). The stated spread over LIBOR can vary from LIBOR plus 0.80% to LIBOR plus 1.55% based on our credit ratings. In addition, a competitive bid option is available for borrowings up to 65% of the Credit Facility amount, which allows banks that are part the lender consortium to bid to make loans at a rate that is lower than the stated rate if market conditions allow. In connection with the Credit Facility Increase, the annual facility fee was also amended to lower the fee to 0.125% from 0.15% , approximately $1,875,000 annually based on the $1,500,000,000 facility size and based on our current credit rating). We did not have any borrowings outstanding under the Credit Facility and had $50,299,000 outstanding in letters of credit that reduced our borrowing capacity as of January 31, 2016 . Financial Covenants We are subject to financial and other covenants contained in the Credit Facility, the Term Loan and the indenture under which our unsecured notes were issued. The principal financial covenants include the following: limitations on the amount of total and secured debt in relation to our overall capital structure; limitations on the amount of our unsecured debt relative to the undepreciated basis of real estate assets that are not encumbered by property-specific financing; and minimum levels of debt service coverage. We were in compliance with these covenants at December 31, 2015 . In addition, our secured borrowings may include yield maintenance, defeasance, or prepayment penalty provisions, which would result in us incurring an additional charge in the event of a full or partial prepayment of outstanding principal before the scheduled maturity. These provisions in our secured borrowings are generally consistent with other similar types of debt instruments issued during the same time period in which our borrowings were secured. Continuous Equity Offering Program In August 2012, we commenced a third continuous equity program ("CEP III"), under which were authorized by our Board of Directors to sell up to $750,000,000 of shares of our common stock from time to time during a 36 -month period. CEP III expired in August 2015, and we had no sales under the program during the year ended December 31, 2015 . In December 2015, we commenced a fourth continuous equity program ("CEP IV") under which we may sell up to $1,000,000,000 of our common stock from time to time. Actual sales will depend on a variety of factors to be determined, including market conditions, the trading price of our common stock and determinations of the appropriate sources of funding. In conjunction with CEP IV, we engaged sales agents who will receive compensation of up to 2.0% of the gross sales price for shares sold. CEP IV 51 Table of Contents also allows us to enter into forward sale agreements up to $1,000,000,000 in aggregate sales price of our common stock. We will physically settle each forward sale agreement on one or more dates prior to the maturity date of that particular forward sale agreement, in which case we will expect to receive aggregate net cash proceeds at settlement equal to the number of shares underlying the particular forward agreement multiplied by the relevant forward sale price. However, we may also elect to cash settle or net share settle a forward sale agreement. In connection with each forward sale agreement, we will pay the relevant forward seller, in the form of a reduced initial forward sale price, commission of up to 2.0% of the sales prices of all borrowed shares of common stock sold. As of December 31, 2015 , we had no sales under the program and had not entered into any forward sale agreements. As of January 31, 2016 , we had $1,000,000,000 of shares remaining authorized for issuance under this program. Forward Equity Contract On September 9, 2014, based on a market closing price of $155.83 per share on that date, we entered into a forward contract to sell 4,500,000 shares of common stock for an initial forward price of $151.74 per share, net of offering fees and discounts (the "Forward"). The sales price and proceeds achieved were determined on the dates of settlement, with adjustments during the term of the contract for the Company dividends as well as for a daily interest factor that varied with changes in the Fed Funds rate. During the year ended December 31, 2015 , we issued 4,500,000 shares of common stock at a weighted average sales price of $146.54 per share, for net proceeds of $659,423,000 , in settlement of the Forward. Forward Interest Rate Swap Agreements During 2015 , we entered into $600,000,000 of forward interest rate swap agreements to reduce the impact of variability in interest rates on a portion of our expected debt issuance activity in 2016 and 2017. At maturity of the agreements, we expect to cash settle the contracts and either pay or receive cash for the then current fair value. Assuming that we issue the debt as expected, the impact from settling these positions will then be recognized over the life of the issued debt as a yield adjustment. During January and February 2016, we entered into $450,000,000 additional forward interest rate swap agreements to reduce the impact of variability of interest rates on an incremental portion of expected debt activity in 2016 and 2017. Future Financing and Capital Needs Debt Maturities One of our principal long-term liquidity needs is the repayment of long-term debt at maturity. For both our unsecured and secured notes, a portion of the principal of these notes may be repaid prior to maturity. Early retirement of our unsecured or secured notes could result in gains or losses on extinguishment. If we do not have funds on hand sufficient to repay our indebtedness as it becomes due, it will be necessary for us to refinance or otherwise provide liquidity to satisfy the debt at maturity. This refinancing may be accomplished by uncollateralized private or public debt offerings, equity issuances, additional debt financing that is secured by mortgages on individual communities or groups of communities or borrowings under our Credit Facility or Term Loan. Although we believe we will have the capacity to meet our currently anticipated liquidity needs, we cannot assure you that additional debt financing or debt or equity offerings will be available or, if available, that they will be on terms we consider satisfactory. The following debt activity occurred during 2015 : In January 2015, in conjunction with the disposition of Avalon on Stamford Harbor, another operating community, AVA Belltown, was substituted as collateral for the disposed community's outstanding fixed rate secured mortgage loan. In March 2015, we borrowed the final $50,000,000 available under the Term Loan, maturing in March 2021 . In April 2015, we repaid an aggregate of $481,582,000 principal amount of secured indebtedness, which includes eight fixed rate mortgage loans secured by eight wholly-owned operating communities, at par. The indebtedness had an aggregate effective interest rate of 3.12% , and a stated maturity date of November 2015 . We incurred a gain on the early debt extinguishment of $8,724,000 , representing the excess of the write-off of unamortized premium from the debt assumed in the Archstone Acquisition. In May 2015, we issued $525,000,000 principal amount of unsecured notes in a public offering under our existing shelf registration statement for net proceeds of approximately $520,653,000 . The notes mature in June 2025 and were issued at a 3.45% coupon interest rate. In June 2015, we repaid a $15,778,000 fixed rate secured mortgage note with an effective interest rate of 7.50% at par in advance of its February 2041 maturity date, recognizing a charge of $455,000 for a prepayment penalty and write-off of unamortized deferred financing costs. 52 Table of Contents In June 2015, we repaid a $7,805,000 fixed rate secured mortgage note with an effective interest rate of 7.84% at par and without penalty in advance of its May 2027 maturity date, recognizing a charge of $263,000 for the write-off of unamortized deferred financing costs. In June 2015, we repaid the $74,531,000 fixed rate secured mortgage note secured by Edgewater, with an effective interest rate of 5.95% at par and without penalty in advance of its May 2019 maturity date, recognizing a charge of $259,000 for the write-off of unamortized deferred financing costs. In July 2015, we repaid a $140,346,000 fixed rate secured mortgage note with an effective interest rate of 5.56% in advance of its May 2053 maturity date, resulting in a recognized gain of $18,987,000 , consisting of the write off of unamortized premium net of unamortized deferred financing costs of $30,215,000 , partially offset by a prepayment penalty of $11,228,000 . In November 2015, we issued $300,000,000 principal amount of unsecured notes in a public offering under our existing shelf registration statement for net proceeds of approximately $297,072,000 . The notes mature in November 2025 and were issued at a 3.5% coupon interest rate. In December 2015, we repaid a $46,938,000 fixed rate secured mortgage note with an effective interest rate of 6.23% , at par, pursuant to its scheduled maturity date. In December 2015, we repaid a $56,492,000 fixed rate secured mortgage note with an effective interest rate of 6.13% , at par, pursuant to its scheduled maturity date. The following table details our consolidated debt maturities for the next five years, excluding our Credit Facility and amounts outstanding related to communities classified as held for sale, for debt outstanding at December 31, 2015 (dollars in thousands) as compared to the amounts of debt outstanding as of at December 31, 2014 . We are not directly or indirectly (as borrower or guarantor) obligated in any material respect to pay principal or interest on the indebtedness of any unconsolidated entities in which we have an equity or other interest. 53 Table of Contents All-In interest rate (1) Principal maturity date Balance Outstanding (2) Community 12/31/2014 12/31/2015 2016 2017 2018 2019 2020 Thereafter Tax-exempt

There is also an associated earlier credit enhancement maturity date. (5) Variable rates are given as of December 31, 2015 . (6) Financed by variable rate debt, but interest rate is capped through an interest rate protection agreement. (7) Borrowing was repaid at par in accordance with its scheduled maturity. (8) In January 2016, another community, Avalon at Stratford, was substituted as collateral for the outstanding borrowing. (9) In conjunction with the disposition of Avalon on Stamford Harbor in January 2015, this community was substituted as collateral for the outstanding borrowing. 55 Table of Contents (10) In April 2015, we repaid this borrowing at par in advance of its maturity date. (11) In July 2015, we elected to repay this borrowing in advance of its maturity date, incurring a prepayment penalty of $11,228,000. Future Financing and Capital Needs Portfolio and Capital Markets Activity In 2016, we expect to meet our liquidity needs from a variety of internal and external sources, including (i) real estate dispositions, (ii) cash balances on hand as well as cash generated from our operating activities, (iii) borrowing capacity under our Credit Facility and (iv) secured and unsecured debt financings. Additional sources of liquidity in 2016 may include the issuance of common and preferred equity. Our ability to obtain additional financing will depend on a variety of factors such as market conditions, the general availability of credit, the overall availability of credit to the real estate industry, our credit ratings and credit capacity, as well as the perception of lenders regarding our long or short-term financial prospects. Before beginning new construction or reconstruction activity, including activity related to communities owned by unconsolidated joint ventures, we intend to plan adequate financing to complete these undertakings, although we cannot assure you that we will be able to obtain such financing. In the event that financing cannot be obtained, we may have to abandon Development Rights, write off associated pre-development costs that were capitalized and/or forego reconstruction activity. In such instances, we will not realize the increased revenues and earnings that we expected from such Development Rights or reconstruction activity and significant losses could be incurred. From time to time we use joint ventures to hold or develop individual real estate assets. We generally employ joint ventures primarily to mitigate asset concentration or market risk and secondarily as a source of liquidity. We may also use joint ventures related to mixed-use land development opportunities where our partners bring development and operational expertise to the venture. Each joint venture or partnership agreement has been individually negotiated, and our ability to operate and/or dispose of a community in our sole discretion may be limited to varying degrees depending on the terms of the joint venture or partnership agreement. We cannot assure you that we will achieve our objectives through joint ventures. In evaluating our allocation of capital within our markets, we sell assets that do not meet our long-term investment criteria or when capital and real estate markets allow us to realize a portion of the value created over the past business cycle and redeploy the proceeds from those sales to develop and redevelop communities. Because the proceeds from the sale of communities may not be immediately redeployed into revenue generating assets that we develop, redevelop or acquire, the immediate effect of a sale of a community for a gain is to increase net income, but reduce future total revenues, total expenses and NOI until such time as the proceeds have been redeployed into revenue generating assets. We believe that the temporary absence of future cash flows from communities sold will not have a material impact on our ability to fund future liquidity and capital resource needs. 56 Table of Contents Unconsolidated Real Estate Investments and Off-Balance Sheet Arrangements Unconsolidated Investments The Funds were established to engage in real estate acquisition programs through discretionary investment funds. We believe this investment format provides the following attributes: (i) third-party joint venture equity as an additional source of financing to expand and diversify our portfolio; (ii) additional sources of income in the form of property management and asset management fees and, potentially, incentive distributions if the performance of the Funds exceeds certain thresholds; and (iii) additional visibility into the transactions occurring in multifamily assets that helps us with other investment decisions related to our wholly-owned portfolio. Fund I had nine institutional investors, including us. One of our wholly-owned subsidiaries was the general partner of Fund I and had a 15.2% combined general partner and limited partner equity interest. Fund I was our principal vehicle for acquiring apartment communities from its formation in March 2005 through the close of its investment period in March 2008. Fund I disposed of the last of its communities in 2014, and was dissolved in April 2015. Fund II has six institutional investors, including us. One of our wholly-owned subsidiaries is the general partner of Fund II and, excluding costs incurred in excess of our equity in the underlying net assets of Fund II, we have an equity investment of $50,443,000 (net of distributions), representing a 31.3% combined general partner and limited partner equity interest. Fund II served as the exclusive vehicle for acquiring apartment communities from its formation in 2008 through the close of its investment period in August 2011. Fund II has a term that expires in August 2020, assuming the exercise of two, one-year extension options. During the year ended December 31, 2015 , Fund II sold four communities containing an aggregate of 1,460 apartment homes for an aggregate sales price of $300,100,000 . Our share of the total gain in accordance with GAAP was $29,726,000 . In conjunction with the disposition of these communities, Fund II repaid $69,036,000 of related secured indebtedness in advance of the scheduled maturity dates, which resulted in charges for a prepayment penalty and write off of deferred financing costs, of which our portion was approximately $1,400,000 . In 2016, Fund II sold Eaves Rancho San Diego, located in El Cajon, CA, containing 676 apartment homes for $158,000,000 . The U.S. Fund has six institutional investors, including us. We are the general partner of the U.S. Fund and, excluding costs incurred in excess of our equity in the underlying net assets of the U.S. Fund, we have an equity investment of $68,683,000 (net of distributions), representing a 28.6% combined equity interest. The U.S. Fund was formed in July 2011 and is fully invested. The U.S. Fund has a term that expires in July 2023, assuming the exercise of two, one-year extension options. We acquired our interest in the U.S. Fund as part of the Archstone Acquisition. In December 2015, a subsidiary of the U.S. Fund obtained a $51,300,000 variable rate, interest only, mortgage note maturing in December 2020, which is secured by Avalon Marina Bay, which has been converted to an effective fixed rate borrowing with an interest rate swap. In 2016, the U.S. Fund sold Archstone Boca Town Center, located in Boca Raton, FL, containing 252 apartment homes for $56,300,000 , and Avalon Kips Bay, located in New York, NY, containing 209 apartment homes for $173,000,000 . The AC JV has four institutional investors, including us. Excluding costs incurred in excess of our equity in the underlying net assets of the AC JV, we have an equity investment of $52,148,000 (net of distributions), representing a 20.0% equity interest. The AC JV was formed in 2011. During 2015, we received $20,680,000 from the joint venture partner associated with MVP I, LLC, the entity that owns Avalon at Mission Bay North II, upon agreement with the partner to modify the joint venture agreement to eliminate our promoted interest from associated distributions for future return calculations. Prospectively, earnings and distributions will be based on our 25.0% equity interest in the venture. During 2015 , SWIB, the joint venture for which we have an 8.0% indirect interest in through the Residual JV, sold the final four communities containing 1,410 apartment homes, for an aggregate sales price of $283,700,000 . Our proportionate share of the gain in accordance with GAAP for the four dispositions was $3,853,000 . In conjunction with the disposition of these communities, SWIB repaid $148,866,000 of related indebtedness on its credit facility in advance of the scheduled maturity dates. In addition, during 2015 , we recognized equity in income of unconsolidated real estate entities of $10,601,000 associated with the settlement of outstanding legal claims against third parties and land sales in the Residual JV. As of December 31, 2015 , we had investments in the following unconsolidated real estate accounted for under the equity method of accounting. Refer to Note 5, Investments in Real Estate Entities, of the Consolidated Financial Statements located elsewhere in this report, which includes information on the aggregate assets, liabilities and equity, as well as operating results, and our proportionate share of their operating results. For ventures holding operating apartment communities as of December 31, 2015 , detail of the real estate and associated funding underlying our unconsolidated investments is presented in the following table (dollars in thousands). 57 Table of Contents Debt (2) Unconsolidated Real Estate Investments Company Ownership Percentage # of Apartment Homes Total Capitalized Cost (1) Principal Amount Type Interest Rate (3) Maturity Date Fund II 1.

(9) Borrowing is comprised of four mortgage loans made by the equity investors in the venture in proportion to their equity interests. (10) In June 2015, MVP I, LLC obtained a $103,000 fixed rate loan, with a maturity date of July 2025, and used the proceeds and cash on hand to repay its existing $105,000 , variable rate loan which was scheduled to mature in December 2015, at par. 58 Table of Contents Off-Balance Sheet Arrangements In addition to our investment interests in consolidated and unconsolidated real estate entities, we have certain off-balance sheet arrangements with the entities in which we invest. Additional discussion of these entities can be found in Note 5, "Investments in Real Estate Entities," of our Consolidated Financial Statements located elsewhere in this report. We have not guaranteed the debt of our unconsolidated real estate entities, as referenced in the table above, nor do we have any obligation to fund this debt should the unconsolidated real estate entities be unable to do so. In the future, in the event the unconsolidated real estate entities were unable to meet their obligations under a loan, we cannot predict at this time whether we would provide any voluntary support, or take any other action, as any such action would depend on a variety of factors, including the amount of support required and the possibility that such support could enhance the return of the unconsolidated real estate entities and/or our returns by providing time for performance to improve. With respect to Fund II, each individual mortgage loan was made to a special purpose, single asset subsidiary of Fund II. Each mortgage loan provides that it is the obligation of the respective subsidiary only, except under exceptional circumstances (such as fraud or misapplication of funds) in which case Fund II could also have obligations with respect to the mortgage loan. In no event do the mortgage loans provide for recourse against investors in Fund II, including against us or our wholly-owned subsidiaries that invest in Fund II. A default by Fund II or a Fund II subsidiary on any loan to it would not constitute a default under any of our loans or any loans of our other non-Fund subsidiaries or affiliates. If Fund II or a subsidiary of Fund II were unable to meet its obligations under a loan, the value of our investment in Fund II would likely decline. If a Fund II subsidiary or Fund II were unable to meet its obligations under a loan, we and/or the other investors might evaluate whether it was in our respective interests to voluntarily support Fund II through additional equity contributions and/or take other actions to avoid a default under a loan or the consequences of a default (such as foreclosure of a Fund II asset). In addition, as part of the formation of Fund II, we provided to one of the limited partners a guarantee. The guarantee provided that if, upon final liquidation of Fund II, the total amount of all distributions to that partner during the life of Fund II (whether from operating cash flow or property sales) did not equal a minimum of the total capital contributions made by that partner, then we would pay the partner an amount equal to the shortfall, but in no event more than 10% of the total capital contributions made by the partner. During the year ended December 31, 2015 , the limited partner transferred its investment interest to an unrelated third party. The guarantee was not transferred with the investment interest, so we have no further obligation under the guarantee. There are no other material lines of credit, side agreements, financial guarantees or any other derivative financial instruments related to or between our unconsolidated real estate entities and us. In evaluating our capital structure and overall leverage, management takes into consideration our proportionate share of the indebtedness of unconsolidated entities in which we have an interest. Contractual Obligations Scheduled contractual obligations required for the next five years and thereafter are as follows as of December 31, 2015 (dollars in thousands): Payments due by period Total Less than 1 Year 1-3 Years 3-5 Years More than 5 Years Debt Obligations $ 6,481,291 $ 282,419 $ 1,070,243 $ 1,297,574 $ 3,831,055 Interest on Debt Obligations 1,420,913 241,423 390,254 261,225 528,011 Capital Lease Obligations (1) (2) 69,785 2,098 19,931 2,136 45,620 Operating Lease Obligations (1) 1,245,596 21,056 41,436 39,569 1,143,535 $ 9,217,585 $ 546,996 $ 1,521,864 $ 1,600,504 $ 5,548,221 _________________________________ (1) Includes land leases expiring between October 2026 and March 2142 . Amounts do not include any adjustment for purchase options available under the land leases. (2) Aggregate capital lease payments include $29,069 in interest costs. 59 Table of Contents Inflation and Deflation Substantially all of our apartment leases are for a term of one year or less. In an inflationary environment, this may allow us to realize increased rents upon renewal of existing leases or the beginning of new leases. Short-term leases generally minimize our risk from the adverse effects of inflation, although these leases generally permit residents to leave at the end of the lease term and therefore expose us to the effects of a decline in market rents. Similarly, in a deflationary rent environment, we may be exposed to declining rents more quickly under these shorter-term leases. Federal Income Tax Law Changes and Updates The following discussion updates the disclosures under Federal Income Tax Considerations and Consequences of Your Investment in the prospectus dated February 19, 2015 contained in our Registration Statement on Form S-3 filed with the SEC on February 19, 2015. The discussion in the last sentence under Federal Income Tax Considerations and Consequences of Your Investment-Other U.S. Federal Income Tax Withholding and Reporting Requirements on page 61 is replaced with the following sentence: Withholding under this legislation will apply after December 31, 2018 with respect to the gross proceeds of a disposition of property that can produce U.S. source interest or dividends and currently applies with respect to other withholdable payments. The discussion under Federal Income Tax Considerations and Consequences of Your Investment-Taxation of AvalonBay as a REIT-Ownership of Partnership Interests by a REIT on page 47 is supplemented by inserting the paragraph below at the end of that subsection: Under the Code, a partnership that is not treated as a corporation under the publicly traded partnership rules generally is not subject to U.S. federal income tax; instead, each partner is allocated its distributive share of the partnership items of income, gain, loss, deduction and credit and is required to take such items into account in determining the partner income. However, a recent law change enacted under the Bipartisan Budget Act of 2015, effective for taxable years beginning after December 31, 2017, requires the partnership to pay the hypothetical increase in partner-level taxes (including interest and penalties) resulting from an adjustment of partnership tax items on audit or in other tax proceedings, unless the partnership elects an alternative method under which the taxes resulting from the adjustment (and interest and penalties) are assessed at the partner level. Many uncertainties remain as to the application of these rules, including the application of the alternative method to partners that are REITs, and the impact they will have on us. However, it is possible, that partnerships in which we invest may be subject to U.S. federal income tax, interest and penalties in the event of a U.S. federal income tax audit as a result of these law changes. Recent legislation modifies several of the REIT rules discussed in the prospectus. The Protecting Americans from Tax Hikes Act of 2015 (the Act ) was enacted on December 18, 2015 and contains several provisions pertaining to REIT qualification and taxation. Some of these implicate certain tax-related disclosure contained in the prospectus and are briefly summarized below: For taxable years beginning after December 31, 2015, the Act expands the exclusion of certain hedging income from the REIT gross income tests to include income from hedges of previously acquired hedges that a REIT entered to manage risk associated with liabilities or property that have been extinguished or disposed. For taxable years beginning before January 1, 2018, no more than 25% of the value of our assets may consist of stock or securities of one or more taxable REIT subsidiaries. For taxable years beginning after December 31, 2017, the Act reduces this limit to 20%. At this time, the securities we own in our taxable REIT subsidiaries do not, in the aggregate, exceed 20% of the total value of our assets. For taxable years beginning after December 31, 2015, for purposes of the REIT asset tests, the Act provides that debt instruments issued by publicly offered REITs will constitute real estate assets. However, unless such a debt instrument is secured by a mortgage or otherwise would have qualified as a real estate asset under prior law, (i) interest income and gain from such a debt instrument is not qualifying income for purposes of the 75% gross income test and (ii) all such debt instruments may represent no more than 25% of the value of our total assets. For taxable years beginning after December 31, 2015, certain obligations secured by a mortgage on both real property and personal property will be treated as a qualifying real estate asset and give rise to qualifying income for purposes of the 75% gross income test if the fair market value of such personal property does not exceed 15% of the total fair market value of all such property. A 100% excise tax is imposed on redetermined TRS service income, which is income of a taxable REIT subsidiary attributable to services provided to, or on behalf of its associated REIT and which would otherwise be increased on distribution, apportionment, or allocation under Section 482 of the Code. 60 Table of Contents For distributions made in taxable years beginning after December 31, 2014, the preferential dividend rules no longer to apply to us. Additional exceptions to the rules under the Foreign Investment in Real Property Act ( FIRPTA ) were introduced for non-U.S. persons that constitute qualified shareholders (within the meaning of Section 897(k)(3) of the Code) or qualified foreign pension funds (within the meaning of Section 897(l)(2) of the Code). After February 16, 2016, the FIRPTA withholding rate under Section 1445 of the Code for dispositions of U.S. real property interests is increased from 10% to 15%. The Act increases from 5% to 10% the maximum stock ownership of the REIT that a non-U.S. shareholder may hold to avail itself of the FIRPTA exception for shares regularly traded on an established securities market. For assets we acquired from a C corporation in a carry-over basis transaction, the Act permanently reduces the recognition period during which we could be subject to corporate tax on any built-in gains recognized on the sale of such assets from 10 years to 5 years. Forward-Looking Statements This Form 10-K contains "forward-looking statements" as that term is defined under the Private Securities Litigation Reform Act of 1995. You can identify forward-looking statements by our use of the words "believe," "expect," "anticipate," "intend," "estimate," "assume," "project," "plan," "may," "shall," "will" and other similar expressions in this Form 10-K, that predict or indicate future events and trends and that do not report historical matters. These statements include, among other things, statements regarding our intent, belief or expectations with respect to: our potential development, redevelopment, acquisition or disposition of communities; the timing and cost of completion of apartment communities under construction, reconstruction, development or redevelopment; the timing of lease-up, occupancy and stabilization of apartment communities; the pursuit of land on which we are considering future development; the anticipated operating performance of our communities; cost, yield, revenue, NOI and earnings estimates; our declaration or payment of distributions; our joint venture and discretionary fund activities; our policies regarding investments, indebtedness, acquisitions, dispositions, financings and other matters; our qualification as a REIT under the Internal Revenue Code; the real estate markets in Northern and Southern California and markets in selected states in the Mid-Atlantic, New England, Metro New York/New Jersey and Pacific Northwest regions of the United States and in general; the availability of debt and equity financing; interest rates; general economic conditions including the potential impacts from current economic conditions; trends affecting our financial condition or results of operations; and the impact of legal proceedings relating to the Edgewater fire and related matters. We cannot assure the future results or outcome of the matters described in these statements; rather, these statements merely reflect our current expectations of the approximate outcomes of the matters discussed. We do not undertake a duty to update these forward-looking statements, and therefore they may not represent our estimates and assumptions after the date of this report. You should not rely on forward-looking statements because they involve known and unknown risks, uncertainties and other factors, some of which are beyond our control. These risks, uncertainties and other factors may cause our actual results, performance or achievements to differ materially from the anticipated future results, performance or achievements expressed or implied by these forward-looking 61 Table of Contents statements. You should carefully review the discussion under Item 1A. "Risk Factors" in this report for further discussion of risks associated with forward-looking statements. Some of the factors that could cause our actual results, performance or achievements to differ materially from those expressed or implied by these forward-looking statements include, but are not limited to, the following: our expectations and assumptions as of the date of this filing regarding the outcome of investigations and/or legal proceedings resulting from the Edgewater fire, as well as the ultimate cost and timing of replacing the Edgewater building and achieving stabilized occupancy in the event the Company chooses to rebuild this community, are subject to change and could materially affect our current expectations regarding the impact of the fire on our business, financial condition and results of operations; we may fail to secure development opportunities due to an inability to reach agreements with third parties to obtain land at attractive prices or to obtain desired zoning and other local approvals; we may abandon or defer development opportunities for a number of reasons, including changes in local market conditions which make development less desirable, increases in costs of development, increases in the cost of capital or lack of capital availability, resulting in losses; construction costs of a community may exceed our original estimates; we may not complete construction and lease-up of communities under development or redevelopment on schedule, resulting in increased interest costs and construction costs and a decrease in our expected rental revenues; occupancy rates and market rents may be adversely affected by competition and local economic and market conditions which are beyond our control; financing may not be available on favorable terms or at all, and our cash flows from operations and access to cost effective capital may be insufficient for the development of our pipeline which could limit our pursuit of opportunities; our cash flows may be insufficient to meet required payments of principal and interest, and we may be unable to refinance existing indebtedness or the terms of such refinancing may not be as favorable as the terms of existing indebtedness; we may be unsuccessful in our management of Fund II, the U.S. Fund, the AC JV or the REIT vehicles that are used with each respective joint venture; and we may be unsuccessful in managing changes in our portfolio composition. Critical Accounting Policies The preparation of financial statements in conformity with GAAP requires management to use judgment in the application of accounting policies, including making estimates and assumptions. If our judgment or interpretation of the facts and circumstances relating to various transactions had been different, or different assumptions were made, it is possible that different accounting policies would have been applied, resulting in different financial results or a different presentation of our financial statements. Below is a discussion of the accounting policies that we consider critical to an understanding of our financial condition and operating results that may require complex or significant judgment in their application or require estimates about matters which are inherently uncertain. A discussion of our significant accounting policies, including further discussion of the accounting policies described below, can be found in Note 1, "Organization and Basis of Presentation," of our Consolidated Financial Statements. Principles of Consolidation We may enter into various joint venture agreements with unrelated third parties to hold or develop real estate assets. We must determine for each of these ventures whether to consolidate the entity or account for our investment under the equity or cost basis of accounting. We determine whether to consolidate certain entities based on our rights and obligations under the joint venture agreements, applying the applicable accounting guidance. For investment interests that we do not consolidate, we evaluate the guidance to determine the accounting framework to apply. The application of the rules in evaluating the accounting treatment for each joint venture is complex and requires substantial management judgment. Therefore, we believe the decision to choose an appropriate accounting framework is a critical accounting estimate. If we were to consolidate the joint ventures that we accounted for using the equity method, excluding the Residual JV, at December 31, 2015 , our assets would have increased by $1,232,958,000 and our liabilities would have increased by $967,676,000 . 62 Table of Contents We would be required to consolidate those joint ventures currently not consolidated for financial reporting purposes if the facts and circumstances changed, including but not limited to the following reasons, none of which are currently expected to occur: For entities not considered to be variable interest entities, the nature of the entity changed such that it would be considered a variable interest entity and we were considered the primary beneficiary. For entities in which we do not hold a controlling voting and/or variable interest, the contractual arrangement changed resulting in our investment interest being either a controlling voting and/or variable interest. We evaluate our accounting for investments on a regular basis including when a significant change in the design of an entity occurs. Cost Capitalization We capitalize costs during the development of assets. Capitalization begins when we determine that development of a future asset is probable and continues until the asset, or a portion of the asset, is delivered and is ready for its intended use. For redevelopment efforts, we capitalize costs either (i) in advance of taking apartment homes out of service when significant renovation of the common area has begun and continue until the redevelopment is completed, or (ii) when an apartment home is taken out of service for redevelopment and continue until the redevelopment is completed and the apartment home is available for a new resident. Rental income and operating expenses incurred during the initial lease-up or post-redevelopment lease-up period are fully recognized in earnings as they accrue. We defer external costs associated with originating new leases, recognizing the impact of these costs in earnings over the term of the lease. During the development and redevelopment efforts we capitalize all direct costs and indirect costs which have been incurred as a result of the development and redevelopment activities. These costs include interest and related loan fees, property taxes as well as other direct and indirect costs. Interest is capitalized for any project-specific financing, as well as for general corporate financing to the extent of our aggregate investment in the projects. Indirect project costs, which include personnel and office and administrative costs that are clearly associated with our development and redevelopment efforts, are also capitalized. Capitalized indirect costs associated with our development and redevelopment activities are comprised primarily of compensation related costs for associates dedicated to our development and redevelopment efforts and total $43,943,000 , $37,433,000 and $38,128,000 for 2015 , 2014 and 2013 , respectively. The estimation of the direct and indirect costs to capitalize as part of our development and redevelopment activities requires judgment and, as such, we believe cost capitalization to be a critical accounting estimate. There may be a change in our operating expenses in the event that there are changes in accounting guidance governing capitalization or changes to our levels of development or redevelopment activity. If changes in the accounting guidance limit our ability to capitalize costs or if we reduce our development and redevelopment activities without a corresponding decrease in indirect project costs, there may be an increase in our operating expenses. For example, if in 2015 our development activities decreased by 10%, and there were no corresponding decrease in our indirect project costs, our costs charged to expense would have increased by $4,394,000 . We capitalize pre-development costs incurred in pursuit of Development Rights. These costs include legal fees, design fees and related overhead costs. Future development of these pursuits is dependent upon various factors, including zoning and regulatory approval, rental market conditions, construction costs and availability of capital. Pre-development costs incurred for pursuits for which future development is not yet considered probable are expensed as incurred. In addition, if the status of a Development Right changes, making future development no longer probable, any capitalized pre-development costs are written off with a charge to expense. Due to the subjectivity in determining whether a pursuit will result in the development of an apartment community, and therefore should be capitalized, the accounting for pursuit costs is a critical accounting estimate. If we had determined that 10% of our capitalized pursuit costs were associated with Development Rights that were no longer probable of occurring, net income for the year ended December 31, 2015 would have decreased by $3,758,000 . Abandoned Pursuit Costs & Asset Impairment We evaluate our real estate and other long-lived assets for impairment when potential indicators of impairment exist. If events or circumstances indicate that the carrying amount of a property may not be recoverable, we assess its recoverability by comparing the carrying amount of the property to its estimated undiscounted future cash flows. If the carrying amount exceeds the aggregate undiscounted future cash flows, we recognize an impairment loss to the extent the carrying amount exceeds the estimated fair value of the property. We assess land held for development for impairment if our intent changes with respect to the development of the land. We evaluate our unconsolidated investments for impairment, considering both the carrying value of the investment, estimated to be the expected proceeds that it would receive if the entity were dissolved and the net assets were liquidated, as well as our proportionate share of any impairment of assets held by unconsolidated investments. 63 Table of Contents We expense costs related to abandoned pursuits, which include the abandonment of Development Rights and disposition pursuits. These costs can vary greatly, and the costs incurred in any given period may be significantly different in future years. Our focus on value creation through real estate development presents an impairment risk in the event of a future deterioration of the real estate and/or capital markets or a decision by us to reduce or cease development. We cannot predict the occurrence of future events that may cause an impairment assessment to be performed, or the likelihood of any future impairment charges, if any. You should also review Item 1A. Risk Factors in this Form 10-K. REIT Status We are a Maryland corporation that has elected to be treated, for federal income tax purposes, as a REIT. We elected to be taxed as a REIT under the Internal Revenue Code for the year ended December 31, 1994 and have not revoked such election. A corporate REIT is a legal entity which holds real estate interests and must meet a number of organizational and operational requirements, including a requirement that it currently distribute at least 90% of its adjusted taxable income to stockholders. As a REIT, we generally will not be subject to corporate level federal income tax on taxable income if we distribute 100% of our taxable income to our stockholders over time periods allowed under the Code. If we fail to qualify as a REIT in any taxable year, we will be subject to federal and state income taxes at regular corporate rates (subject to any applicable alternative minimum tax) and may not be able to elect to qualify as a REIT for four subsequent taxable years. For example, if we failed to qualify as a REIT in 2015 , our net income would have decreased by approximately $298,299,000 . Our qualification as a REIT requires management to exercise significant judgment and consideration with respect to operational matters and accounting treatment. Therefore, we believe our REIT status is a critical accounting estimate. Acquisition of Investments in Real Estate We account for acquisitions of investments in real estate in accordance with the authoritative guidance for the initial measurement, which requires the identifiable assets acquired, the liabilities assumed, and any noncontrolling interest in the acquiree to be recognized at fair value. Typical assets and liabilities acquired include land, building, furniture, fixtures and equipment and identified intangible assets and liabilities, consisting of the value of above-below market leases and in-place leases. In making estimates of fair values for purposes of allocating purchase price, we utilize various sources, including our own analysis of recently acquired and existing comparable properties in our portfolio and other market data. 64 Table of Contents
