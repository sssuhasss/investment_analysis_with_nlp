Item 7. Management Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations The following discussion and analysis should be read in conjunction with our consolidated financial statements and related combined notes included in this Annual Report on Form 10-K. References in this Annual Report to "NU," the "Company," "we," "us" and "our" refer to Northeast Utilities and its subsidiaries. All per share amounts are reported on a diluted basis. Refer to the Glossary of Terms included in this Annual Report on Form 10-K for abbreviations and acronyms used throughout this Management's Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations . The only common equity securities that are publicly traded are common shares of NU. The earnings and EPS of each business discussed below do not represent a direct legal interest in the assets and liabilities allocated to such business but rather represent a direct interest in our assets and liabilities as a whole. EPS by business is a financial measure not recognized under GAAP that is calculated by dividing the Net Income Attributable to Controlling Interest of each business by the weighted average diluted NU common shares outstanding for the period. The discussion below also includes non-GAAP financial measures referencing our 2012, 2011, and 2010 earnings and EPS excluding certain impacts related to NU's merger with NSTAR, a 2011 non-recurring charge at CL&P for the establishment of a reserve to provide bill credits to its residential customers and donations to charitable organizations, and certain non-recurring benefits from the settlement of tax issues in 2010. We use these non-GAAP financial measures to evaluate and to provide details of earnings results by business and to more fully compare and explain our 2012, 2011 and 2010 results without including the impact of these non-recurring items. Due to the nature and significance of these items on Net Income Attributable to Controlling Interest, we believe that the non-GAAP presentation is more representative of our financial performance and provides additional and useful information to readers of this report in analyzing historical and future performance by business. These non-GAAP financial measures should not be considered as an alternative to reported Net Income Attributable to Controlling Interest or EPS determined in accordance with GAAP as an indicator of operating performance. Reconciliations of the above non-GAAP financial measures to the most directly comparable GAAP measures of consolidated diluted EPS and Net Income Attributable to Controlling Interest are included under "Financial Condition and Business Analysis Overview Consolidated" in Management's Discussion and Analysis , herein. Financial Condition and Business Analysis Merger with NSTAR: On April 10, 2012, NU and NSTAR completed our merger. Pursuant to the terms and conditions of the Agreement and Plan of Merger, as amended (the Merger Agreement), NSTAR merged into NSTAR LLC, becoming a wholly-owned subsidiary of NU. Unless otherwise noted, the results of NSTAR LLC and its subsidiaries, hereinafter referred to as "NSTAR," are included from the date of merger, April 10, 2012, through December 31, 2012 throughout this Management's Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations . The transaction was structured as a merger of equals in a tax-free exchange of shares. Pursuant to the Merger Agreement, NU issued to NSTAR shareholders 1.312 NU common shares for each issued and outstanding NSTAR common share. As a result, NU issued approximately 136 million common shares to the NSTAR shareholders. Executive Summary The following items in this executive summary are explained in more detail in this Annual Report: Results and Outlook: We earned $525.9 million, or $1.89 per share, in 2012, compared with $394.7 million, or $2.22 per share, in 2011. Excluding after-tax merger-related costs of $107.6 million, or $0.39 per share, we earned $633.5 million, or $2.28 per share, in 2012. Excluding after-tax merger-related costs of $11.3 million, or $0.06 per share, and a non-recurring charge at CL&P of $17.9 million, or $0.10 per share, we earned $423.9 million, or $2.38 per share, in 2011. The non-recurring 2011 charge at CL&P relates to the establishment of a reserve to provide bill credits to its residential customers and donations to charitable organizations (storm fund reserve). Improved earnings results in 2012 were due primarily to the inclusion of NSTAR effective April 10, 2012 as well as higher transmission segment earnings as a result of increased investments in the transmission infrastructure. The addition of NSTAR effective April 10, 2012 provided an earnings contribution of $182.9 million in 2012. Due to the timing of the merger closing, NSTAR results for the first three months of 2012 are not reflected in NU 2012 results. Our transmission segment earned $249.7 million, or $0.90 per share, in 2012, compared with $199.6 million, or $1.12 per share, in 2011. Our electric distribution segment, which includes generation, earned $292.3 million, or $1.04 per share, in 2012, compared with $189.1 million, or $1.06 per share, in 2011. The 2012 results include $51.1 million, or $0.19 per share, of after-tax merger settlement agreement costs and the 2011 results include the CL&P storm fund reserve. 32 Our natural gas distribution segment earned $30.8 million, or $0.11 per share, in 2012, compared with $31.7 million, or $0.18 per share, in 2011. The 2012 results include $2.1 million, or $0.01 per share, of after-tax merger settlement agreement costs. NU parent and other companies recorded net losses of $46.9 million, or $0.16 per share, in 2012, compared with net losses of $25.7 million, or $0.14 per share, in 2011. The 2012 and 2011 results include $54.4 million, or $0.19 per share, and $11.3 million, or $0.06 per share, respectively, of after-tax merger costs. We project capital expenditures of approximately $5 billion from 2013 through 2015. Of the $5 billion, we expect to invest approximately $2.5 billion in our electric and natural gas distribution segments, and $2.3 billion in our electric transmission segment. In addition, we project capital expenditures of approximately $1.6 billion from 2016 through 2017 in our electric transmission segment. Legislative, Regulatory, Policy and Other Items: On June 15, 2012, Connecticut enacted the "Enhancing Emergency Preparedness and Response Act," which is intended to enhance the state emergency preparedness and response in the event of natural disasters. Among numerous provisions, the bill required the PURA to establish emergency performance standards for utilities and allows the PURA to levy penalties for failure to meet those standards. On August 1, 2012, efforts to settle a complaint filed at FERC by various New England parties concerning the base ROE earned by New England transmission owners ended without a settlement. Soon thereafter, litigation began before a FERC trial judge. In the fourth quarter of 2012, additional testimony and complaints were filed. On January 18, 2013, the FERC trial staff filed testimony and analysis recommending a base ROE of 9.66 percent based on the midpoint of their analysis with a range of reasonableness of 6.82 percent to 12.51 percent. Hearings are scheduled for May 2013, a trial judge ruling is due in September 2013, and a FERC decision is expected in 2014. On August 1, 2012, PURA issued a final decision in the investigation of CL&P performance related to both Tropical Storm Irene and the October 2011 snowstorm. The decision concluded that CL&P was deficient and inadequate in its preparation, response, and communication to both storms, and identified certain penalties that could be imposed on CL&P during its next rate case. However, PURA will consider and weigh the extent to which CL&P has taken steps to improve current practices in future storm response in determining any potential penalties. We believe such steps to improve current storm preparation and response practices have been successfully executed in recent storms, and that CL&P's response to these 2011 storms was prudent and consistent with industry standards, and that it is probable that it will be able to recover its deferred costs. On August 3, 2012, Massachusetts Governor Patrick signed into law "An Act Relative to Competitively Priced Electricity in the Commonwealth." The Act establishes distribution rate case requirements for both electric and natural gas utility companies, as well as limiting settlement agreements, establishes new timing on rate case proceedings, and establishes requirements for all distribution companies to enter into additional long-term renewable energy distribution contracts. On August 6, 2012, Massachusetts Governor Patrick signed into law "An Act relative to emergency service response of public utility companies" to help improve utility companies emergency response and communication, as well as indicate how any assessed penalties will be provided to customers. On October 29, 2012, Hurricane Sandy caused extensive damage to our electric distribution system across all three states resulting in deferred storm restoration costs of $204 million. Approximately 1.5 million of our 3.1 million electric distribution customers were without power during or following the storm. We believe the storm restoration costs meet the criteria for specific cost recovery in each state in which we operate and, as a result, we do not expect the storm to have a material impact on our results of operations. On December 11, 2012, in separate orders issued by the DPU, NSTAR Electric and WMECO received penalties of $4.1 million and $2 million, respectively, related to the investigation into the electric utilities responses to Tropical Storm Irene and the October 2011 snowstorm. The DPU stated that NSTAR Electric failed to communicate and prioritize restoration efforts in both storms and WMECO failed to prioritize restoration efforts in the October snowstorm. On December 28, 2012, NSTAR Electric and WMECO each filed appeals arguing the DPU penalties should be vacated. While we believe NSTAR Electric and WMECO should ultimately prevail upon appeal, we are unable to conclusively state that a favorable outcome is probable. On January 16, 2013, PURA approved the $300 million plan CL&P filed on July 9, 2012 to improve the resiliency of the CL&P electric distribution system. The plan is consistent with the terms of the Connecticut settlement agreement among NU, NSTAR, and various Connecticut state agencies. On February 8, 2013, a blizzard caused damage to the electric delivery systems of CL&P and NSTAR Electric. We have estimated that approximately 71,000 and 350,000 of CL&P and NSTAR Electric's distribution customers, respectively, were without power during or following the storm. We believe that this storm will cost between $100 million to $120 million, with approximately 90 percent of those costs relating to NSTAR Electric. We expect the storm restoration costs to meet the criteria for specific cost 33 recovery in each state in which we operate and, as a result, we do not expect the storm to have a material impact on our results of operations. On February 19, 2013, Connecticut issued a final comprehensive energy strategy (strategy). The strategy includes a series of policy proposals that aim to expand energy choices, including natural gas, improve environmental conditions, create clean energy jobs, and enhance the quality of life for customers in the state. Many of the recommendations in the strategy will require actions by the PURA and potentially the legislature. NPT has identified a new route in the northern-most part of the project route where PSNH did not own any rights of way. We expect to file the new route with the DOE in the first quarter of 2013, and we believe that NPT will be completed in early 2017. We estimate the costs of the Northern Pass transmission project will be approximately $1.2 billion. Liquidity: Cash and cash equivalents totaled $45.7 million as of December 31, 2012, compared with $6.6 million as of December 31, 2011, while cash capital expenditures totaled $1.5 billion in 2012, compared with $1.1 billion in 2011. Cash flows provided by operating activities in 2012 totaled $1.05 billion, compared with operating cash flows of $901.1 million in 2011 (amounts are net of RRB payments). The improved cash flows were due primarily to the addition of NSTAR, which contributed $450.8 million of operating cash flows (net of RRB payments) to NU since the date of the merger, April 10, 2012. Offsetting the favorable NSTAR cash flow impact was an increase in storm restoration costs, NUSCO Pension Plan cash contributions, 2012 customer bill credits and NU Parent merger transaction cost payments. In 2012, we issued $850 million of new long-term debt consisting of $400 million by NSTAR Electric, $300 million by NU Parent, and $150 million by WMECO. These new issuances were used primarily to repay $716.8 million of existing long-term debt, of which $663 million matured in 2012 ($400 million at NSTAR Electric and $263 million at NU Parent) and WMECO tax-exempt PCRBs of $53.8 million scheduled to mature in 2028. Additionally, CL&P remarketed $62 million of tax-exempt PCRBs in April 2012 and redeemed $116.4 million of tax-exempt PCRBs in October 2012. As of December 31, 2012, approximately $730 million of NU's current liabilities relate to long-term debt that will be paid in the next 12 months. On March 26, 2012, CL&P entered into a five-year $300 million unsecured revolving credit facility. The credit facility is intended to finance short-term borrowings that CL&P incurred to fund costs of restoring power following Tropical Storm Irene and the October 2011 snowstorm. As of December 31, 2012, CL&P had $89 million in borrowings outstanding under this credit facility. On July 25, 2012, NU and certain of its subsidiaries jointly entered into a five-year $1.15 billion revolving credit facility, and NSTAR Electric entered into a five-year $450 million revolving credit facility. The new facilities expire on July 25, 2017 and will be used primarily to backstop NU $1.15 billion commercial paper program and NSTAR Electric $450 million commercial paper program. As of December 31, 2012, NU and NSTAR Electric had $1.15 billion and $276 million in borrowings outstanding under their respective commercial paper programs. On January 15, 2013, CL&P issued $400 million of 2.5 percent first mortgage bonds that will mature on January 15, 2023. The proceeds, net of issuance costs, were used to repay CL&P revolving credit facility borrowings of $89 million and $305.8 million of its commercial paper program borrowings. On February 5, 2013, our Board of Trustees approved a common dividend payment of $0.3675 per share, payable March 28, 2013 to shareholders of record as of March 1, 2013. The dividend represented an increase of 7.1 percent over the $0.343 per share quarterly dividend paid in December 2012. 34 Overview Consolidated: A summary of our earnings by business, which also reconciles the non-GAAP financial measures of consolidated non-GAAP earnings and EPS, as well as EPS by business, to the most directly comparable GAAP measures of consolidated Net Income Attributable to Controlling Interest and diluted EPS, for 2012, 2011 and 2010 is as follows: For the Years Ended December 31, 2012 (1) 2011 2010 (Millions of Dollars, Except Per Share Amounts) Amount Per Share Amount Per Share Amount Per Share Net Income Attributable to Controlling Interest (GAAP) $ 525.9 $ 1.89 $ 394.7 $ 2.22 $ 387.9 $ 2.19 Regulated Companies $ 626.0 $ 2.25 $ 438.3 $ 2.46 $ 384.0 $ 2.16 NU Parent and Other Companies 7.5 0.03 (14.4) (0.08) (2.4) (0.00) Non-GAAP Earnings 633.5 2.28 423.9 2.38 381.6 2.16 Merger and Related Costs (after-tax) (107.6) (0.39) (11.3) (0.06) (9.4) (0.06) Storm Fund Reserve - - (17.9) (0.10) - - Non-Recurring Tax Settlements - - - - 15.7 0.09 Net Income Attributable to Controlling Interest (GAAP) $ 525.9 $ 1.89 $ 394.7 $ 2.22 $ 387.9 $ 2.19 (1) Results include the operations of NSTAR from the date of merger, April 10, 2012, through December 31, 2012. The after-tax merger and related costs for 2012 consisted of the following charges: Transaction and integration-related costs of $34 million at NU parent related to investment advisory fees, attorney fees, and consulting costs; Change in control costs and other compensation costs of $13.5 million at NU parent and NSTAR; A $23.6 million charge at CL&P related to the Connecticut settlement agreement, pursuant to which CL&P agreed to forego recovery of $40 million (pre-tax) of deferred storm restoration costs associated with Tropical Storm Irene and the October 2011 snowstorm; A $14.8 million charge at CL&P for customer bill credits related to the Connecticut settlement agreement; An aggregate of $12.8 million of charges at NSTAR Electric, NSTAR Gas, and WMECO for customer bill credits related to the Massachusetts settlement agreement; and An $8.9 million charge at NU parent for the establishment of a fund to advance Connecticut energy goals related to the Connecticut settlement agreement. Excluding the impacts of the 2012 and 2011 merger and related settlement agreement costs and the 2011 storm fund reserve, our 2012 earnings increased by $209.6 million, as compared to 2011, due primarily to the inclusion of NSTAR effective April 10, 2012, and higher transmission segment earnings as a result of increased investments in the transmission infrastructure. On an earnings per share basis, the 2012 NSTAR earnings contribution of $182.9 million ($204.5 million in non-GAAP earnings) was partially offset by the issuance of approximately 136 million common shares to close the merger. Offsetting these favorable earnings impacts were lower retail electric and firm natural gas sales due primarily to significantly milder weather in the first quarter of 2012, compared with the first quarter of 2011, higher pension and healthcare costs, higher depreciation and property taxes. Regulated Companies: Our Regulated companies consist of the electric distribution, natural gas distribution, and transmission segments. Generation activities of PSNH and WMECO are included in our electric distribution segment. A summary of our segment earnings for 2012, 2011 and 2010 is as follows: For the Years Ended December 31, (Millions of Dollars) 2012 (1) 2011 2010 Net Income - Regulated Companies (GAAP) $ 572.8 $ 420.4 $ 384.0 Electric Distribution $ 343.4 $ 207.0 $ 173.5 Transmission 249.7 199.6 177.8 Natural Gas Distribution 32.9 31.7 32.7 Net Income - Regulated Companies (Non-GAAP) 626.0 438.3 384.0 Merger Settlement Agreement Costs (after-tax) (2) (53.2) - - Storm Fund Reserve (3) - (17.9) - Net Income - Regulated Companies (GAAP) $ 572.8 $ 420.4 $ 384.0 (1) Results include NSTAR Electric and NSTAR Gas earnings from the date of merger, April 10, 2012, through December 31, 2012. (2) Merger settlement agreement costs are attributable to the electric distribution segment ($51.1 million) and the natural gas distribution segment ($2.1 million). (3) The storm fund reserve is attributable to the electric distribution segment. 35 The higher 2012 transmission segment earnings, as compared to 2011, were due primarily to the inclusion of the NSTAR Electric transmission business and increased investments in the transmission infrastructure, including GSRP, which is under construction in western Massachusetts and northern Connecticut. Our electric distribution segment earned $292.3 million in 2012, compared with $189.1 million in 2011. Excluding the impacts of the 2012 merger settlement agreement costs and the 2011 storm fund reserve, our electric distribution segment earned $343.4 million in 2012 and $207 million in 2011. The higher earnings were due primarily to the addition of NSTAR Electric. Excluding $10.9 million of after-tax merger settlement agreement costs, which related to customer bill credits, NSTAR Electric distribution business earned $150.2 million from April 10, 2012 through December 31, 2012. For further information regarding NSTAR Electric earnings, see "Results of Operations NSTAR Electric Company and Subsidiaries Earnings Summary" in this Management's Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations. Offsetting this favorable earnings impact was lower retail revenue, which was primarily the result of warmer than normal weather in the first quarter of 2012 as compared to colder than normal weather in the first quarter of 2011. In addition, our electric distribution segment had higher pension and employee benefit costs, higher depreciation and property taxes, and the DPU October snowstorm penalty ($2 million pre-tax) imposed on WMECO in December 2012, partially offset by the favorable impacts of the CL&P and PSNH 2010 distribution rate case decisions. As a result of these decisions, the CL&P rates increased effective July 1, 2011, which resulted in a full year favorable impact to earnings in 2012, while the PSNH rates increased effective July 1, 2012. Our natural gas distribution segment earned $30.8 million in 2012, compared with $31.7 million in 2011. Excluding the impact of the merger settlement agreement costs, our natural gas distribution segment earned $32.9 million in 2012. The higher earnings were due primarily to the addition of NSTAR Gas results. Excluding $2.1 million of after-tax merger settlement agreement costs, which related to customer bill credits, NSTAR Gas earnings were $6.6 million from April 10, 2012 through December 31, 2012. Offsetting this favorable earnings impact was a decrease in total firm natural gas sales, which was primarily the result of warmer than normal weather in the first quarter of 2012 as compared to colder than normal weather in the first quarter of 2011, and higher pension expense, depreciation and property taxes. These costs were partially offset by lower operations and maintenance costs as well as the favorable impact of the Yankee Gas 2011 rate case decision resulting in the additional increase to annualized rates effective July 1, 2012. A summary of our retail electric GWh sales and percentage changes, as well as changes in CL&P, NSTAR Electric, PSNH and WMECO retail electric GWh sales, and our firm natural gas sales and percentage changes in million cubic feet, as well as changes in Yankee Gas and NSTAR Gas sales in million cubic feet, for 2012, as compared to 2011, is as follows: For the Year Ended December 31, 2012 Compared to 2011 Sales (GWh) Percentage NU Electric 2012 (1) 2011 Increase Residential 19,719 14,766 33.5% Commercial 24,117 14,301 68.6% Industrial 5,462 4,418 23.6% Other 420 327 28.6% Total 49,718 33,812 47.0% For the Year Ended December 31, 2012 Compared to 2011 CL&P NSTAR Electric (2) PSNH WMECO Electric Percentage Increase/ (Decrease) Percentage Increase/ (Decrease) Percentage Increase/ (Decrease) Percentage Increase/ (Decrease) Residential (1.1)% 0.2 % (0.1)% (1.0)% Commercial (1.2)% (1.7)% 0.0 % 0.7 % Industrial 0.5 % (4.6)% 0.7 % (0.9)% Other 2.3 % (12.2)% (1.0)% (5.7)% Total (0.9)% (1.4)% 0.1 % (0.3)% (1) NU retail electric sales include the sales of NSTAR Electric from the date of merger, April 10, 2012, through December 31, 2012. (2) Results for NSTAR Electric represent its standalone retail electric sales for the year ended December 31, 2012 and 2011. 36 For the Year Ended December 31, 2012 Compared to 2011 Sales (million cubic feet) Percentage NU Firm Natural Gas 2012 (1) 2011 Increase Residential 22,535 13,508 66.8% Commercial 27,906 17,175 62.5% Industrial 19,453 16,197 20.1% Total 69,894 46,880 49.1% Total, Net of Special Contracts (2) 64,140 38,197 67.9% For the Year Ended December 31, 2012 Compared to 2011 Yankee Gas NSTAR Gas (3) Firm Natural Gas Percentage Increase/ (Decrease) Percentage Decrease Residential (7.6)% (10.7)% Commercial (3.5)% (2.9)% Industrial (2.5)% (0.4)% Total (4.3)% (6.2)% Total, Net of Special Contracts (2) 2.3 % (1) NU firm natural gas sales include the sales of NSTAR Gas from the date of merger, April 10, 2012, through December 31, 2012. (2) Special contracts are unique to the customers who take service under such an arrangement and generally specify the amount of distribution revenue to be paid to Yankee Gas regardless of the customers usage. (3) NSTAR Gas sales data for the year ended December 31, 2012 compared to 2011 has been provided for comparative purposes only. Weather and, to a lesser extent, fluctuations in fuel costs, conservation measures, and economic conditions affect sales to our customers. Industrial sales are less sensitive to temperature variations than residential and commercial sales. Weather impacts electric sales primarily during the summer and natural gas sales during the winter in our service territories (natural gas sales are more sensitive to temperature variations than electric sales). Customer heating or cooling usage may not directly correlate with historical levels or with the level of degree-days that occur, particularly when weather patterns experienced are consistently colder or warmer. In addition, our electric and natural gas businesses are sensitive to variations in daily weather, are highly influenced by New England seasonal weather variations, and are susceptible to damage from major storms and other natural events and disasters that could adversely affect our ability to provide energy. Our consolidated retail electric and firm natural gas sales were higher in 2012, as compared to 2011, due to the inclusion of NSTAR Electric and NSTAR Gas sales, respectively, from the date of merger, April 10, 2012, through December 31, 2012. Actual retail electric sales for CL&P, NSTAR Electric and WMECO decreased in 2012, as compared to 2011, due primarily to the warmer than normal weather in the first quarter of 2012, as compared to colder than normal weather in the first quarter of 2011, while actual retail electric sales for PSNH were 0.1 percent higher than last year. In 2012, heating degree days were 11 percent lower in Connecticut and western Massachusetts, 7 percent lower in the Boston metropolitan area, and 9 percent lower in New Hampshire, as compared to 2011. On a weather normalized basis (based on 30-year average temperatures), the average NU combined consolidated total retail electric sales decreased 0.2 percent in 2012, as compared to 2011, assuming NSTAR Electric had been part of the NU combined electric distribution system for all periods under consideration. We believe these decreases were due primarily to increased conservation efforts among all our customer classes and the continued installation of distributed generation at our commercial and industrial customers facilities. For WMECO, the fluctuations in retail electric sales no longer impact earnings as the DPU approved a sales decoupling plan effective February 1, 2011. Under this decoupling plan, WMECO now has an established annual level of baseline distribution delivery service revenues of $125.4 million that it is able to recover. This effectively breaks the relationship between sales volume and revenues recognized. Our firm natural gas sales are subject to many of the same influences as our retail electric sales, but have benefitted from lower natural gas prices and customer growth across all three customer classes. In 2012, excluding the impact of NSTAR Gas sales, actual sales decreased, as compared to 2011, due primarily to the warmer than normal weather in the first quarter of 2012, as compared to colder than normal weather in the first quarter of 2011. On a weather normalized basis, Yankee Gas 2012 sales increased due primarily to customer growth, lower cost of natural gas, the migration of interruptible customers switching to firm service rates, and the addition of gas-fired distributed generation in Yankee Gas service territory. On a weather-normalized basis, the average NU combined consolidated total firm natural gas sales increased 2.7 percent in 2012, as compared to 2011, assuming NSTAR Gas had been part of the NU combined natural gas distribution system for all periods under consideration. 37 NU Parent and Other Companies: NU parent and other companies (which includes our competitive businesses held by NU Enterprises and, from April 10, 2012, NSTAR LLC) recorded net losses of $46.9 million in 2012, compared with net losses of $25.7 million in 2011. Excluding the impact of the 2012 and 2011 merger and related settlement agreement costs, NU parent and other companies recorded earnings of $7.5 million and net losses of $14.4 million, respectively. The NU parent merger and related settlement agreement costs primarily included fees paid to investment advisors and attorneys, a charge for the establishment of a fund to advance Connecticut energy goals related to the Connecticut settlement agreement, and change in control costs and other compensation costs. Excluding merger and related settlement agreement costs, improved results were due primarily to lower interest expense, a lower effective tax rate and the inclusion of NSTAR Communications. Major Storm Restoration Costs: A storm must meet certain criteria specific to each state and utility company to be declared a major storm. Once a storm is declared major, all qualifying expenses incurred during storm restoration efforts, if deemed prudent, are deferred and recovered from customers in future periods. In Connecticut, qualifying storm restoration costs must exceed $5 million for a storm to be declared as a major storm. In Massachusetts, qualifying storm costs must exceed $1 million for NSTAR Electric and $300,000 for WMECO and an emergency response plan must be initiated for a storm to be declared a major storm. In New Hampshire, (1) at least 10 percent of customers must be without power with at least 200 concurrent locations requiring repairs (trouble spots), or (2) at least 300 concurrent trouble spots must be reported for a storm to be declared a major storm. On October 29, 2012, Hurricane Sandy caused extensive damage to our electric distribution system across all three states resulting in deferred storm restoration costs of $204 million ($159.9 million for CL&P, $27.8 million for NSTAR Electric, $12.1 million for PSNH, and $4.2 million for WMECO). Approximately 1.5 million of our 3.1 million electric distribution customers were without power during or following the storm, with approximately 850,000 of those customers in Connecticut, approximately 472,000 in Massachusetts, and approximately 137,000 in New Hampshire. We expect the storm restoration costs to meet the criteria for specific cost recovery in Connecticut, Massachusetts, and New Hampshire and, as a result, we do not expect the storm to have a material impact on the results of operations of CL&P, NSTAR Electric, PSNH or WMECO. Each operating company will seek recovery of these deferred storm restoration costs through its applicable regulatory recovery process. Liquidity Consolidated: Cash and cash equivalents totaled $45.7 million as of December 31, 2012, compared with $6.6 million as of December 31, 2011. On March 22, 2012, NU parent issued $300 million of 18-month floating rate Series D Senior Notes with a maturity date of September 20, 2013 and a coupon rate based on the three-month LIBOR rate plus a credit spread of 75 basis points, which resets every three months. As of December 31, 2012, the interest rate on these notes was 1.059 percent. The proceeds, net of issuance costs, were used to repay the NU parent $263 million Series A Senior Notes that matured on April 1, 2012, to repay short-term borrowings and for other general corporate purposes. On March 22, 2012, the FERC approved CL&P's application requesting to increase its total short-term borrowing capacity from a maximum of $450 million to a maximum of $600 million through December 31, 2013. On March 26, 2012, CL&P entered into a five-year $300 million unsecured revolving credit facility. The credit facility is intended to finance short-term borrowings that CL&P incurred to fund costs of restoring power following Tropical Storm Irene and the October 2011 snowstorm. Under this new facility, CL&P can borrow either on a short-term or a long-term basis subject to any necessary regulatory approval, and may borrow at prime rates or LIBOR-based rates, plus an applicable margin based on the higher of S&P or Moody credit ratings. As of December 31, 2012, CL&P had $89 million in borrowings outstanding under this credit facility. The weighted-average interest rate on these borrowings as of December 31, 2012 was 3.325 percent. On April 2, 2012, CL&P remarketed $62 million of tax-exempt PCRBs that were subject to mandatory tender on that date. The PCRBs, which mature on May 1, 2031, carry a coupon rate of 1.55 percent during the current three-year fixed-rate period, and are subject to mandatory tender for purchase on April 1, 2015. On May 16, 2012, the FERC granted authorization to allow NSTAR Electric to issue total short-term debt securities in an aggregate principal amount not to exceed $655 million outstanding at any one time, effective October 23, 2012 through October 23, 2014. On July 25, 2012, NU, CL&P, NSTAR LLC, NSTAR Gas, PSNH, WMECO, and Yankee Gas jointly entered into a five-year $1.15 billion revolving credit facility. The new facility replaced (1) the NSTAR LLC revolving credit facility of $175 million that served to backstop a commercial paper program utilized by NSTAR LLC and was scheduled to expire on December 31, 2012, (2) the NSTAR Gas revolving credit facility of $75 million that expired on June 8, 2012, and (3) the CL&P, PSNH, WMECO, and Yankee Gas joint $400 million and NU parent $500 million unsecured revolving credit facilities that were scheduled to expire on September 24, 2013. The new facility expires on July 25, 2017. We expect the new facility to be used primarily to backstop the $1.15 billion commercial paper program at NU, which commenced July 25, 2012. As of December 31, 2012, NU had $1.15 billion in borrowings outstanding under this commercial paper program. The weighted-average interest rate on these borrowings as of December 31, 2012 was 0.46 percent, which is generally based on money market rates. As of December 31, 2012, there were inter-company loans of $987.5 million from NU to its subsidiaries ($405.1 million for CL&P, $63.3 million for PSNH, and $31.9 million for WMECO). 38 On July 25, 2012, NSTAR Electric entered into a five-year $450 million revolving credit facility. This new facility serves to backstop NSTAR Electric existing $450 million commercial paper program. The new facility expires on July 25, 2017. This new facility replaced a prior $450 million NSTAR Electric revolving credit facility that was scheduled to expire on December 31, 2012. As of December 31, 2012, NSTAR Electric had $276 million in short-term borrowings outstanding under its commercial paper program, leaving $174 million of available borrowing capacity. The weighted-average interest rate on these borrowings as of December 31, 2012 was 0.31 percent, which is generally based on money market rates. On July 31, 2012, the DPU approved NSTAR Electric's application for a new two-year financing plan that provides for the issuance of long-term debt securities in an aggregate amount not to exceed $600 million prior to December 31, 2013. On October 1, 2012, CL&P redeemed at par four different series of tax-exempt PCRBs totaling $116.4 million. The PCRBs carried coupons that ranged from 5.85 percent to 5.95 percent and maturity dates that ranged from 2016 through 2028. On October 1, 2012, WMECO redeemed at par $53.8 million of tax-exempt PCRBs. The PCRBs had a maturity date of 2028 and a coupon of 5.85 percent. On October 4, 2012, WMECO issued at a premium $150 million of senior unsecured notes at a yield of 2.673 percent that will mature on September 15, 2021. The senior unsecured notes are part of the same series of WMECO existing 3.5 percent coupon Series F Notes that were initially issued in September 2011. As a result, the aggregate principal amount of WMECO outstanding Series F Notes now totals $250 million. On October 15, 2012, NSTAR Electric issued at a discount $400 million of 2.375 percent Debentures at a yield of 2.406 percent that will mature on October 15, 2022. The proceeds, net of issuance costs, were used to pay $400 million of 4.875 percent Debentures that matured on October 15, 2012. On January 15, 2013, CL&P issued $400 million of 2.5 percent first mortgage bonds that will mature on January 15, 2023. The proceeds, net of issuance costs, were used to repay CL&P revolving credit facility borrowings of $89 million and $305.8 million of its commercial paper program borrowings. NU, CL&P, NSTAR Electric, PSNH and WMECO use their available capital resources to fund their respective construction expenditures, meet debt requirements, pay costs, including storm-related costs, pay dividends and fund other corporate obligations, such as pension contributions. The current growth in NU transmission construction expenditures utilizes a significant amount of cash for projects that have a long-term return on investment and recovery period. In addition, NU Regulated companies operate in an environment where recovery of its electric and natural gas distribution construction expenditures takes place over an extended period of time. This impacts the timing of the revenue stream designed to fully recover the total investment plus a return on the equity portion of the cost and related financing costs. These factors have resulted in NU current liabilities exceeding current assets by approximately $1.4 billion, $268 million, $198 million and $60 million at NU, CL&P, NSTAR Electric and WMECO, respectively, as of December 31, 2012. As of December 31, 2012, approximately $730 million of NU's current liabilities relates to long-term debt that will be paid in the next 12 months, consisting of $550 million for NU parent, $55 million for WMECO, and $125 million for CL&P. NU, with its strong credit ratings, has several options available in the financial markets to repay or refinance these maturities with the issuance of new long-term debt. NU, CL&P, NSTAR Electric, and WMECO will reduce their short-term borrowings with cash received from operating cash flows or with the issuance of new long-term debt, as deemed appropriate given our capital requirements and maintenance of our credit rating and profile. Management expects the future operating cash flows of NU and its subsidiaries, along with the access to financial markets, will be sufficient to meet any future operating requirements and capital investment forecasted opportunities. Cash flows provided by operating activities in 2012 totaled $1.05 billion, compared with operating cash flows of $901.1 million in 2011 and $832.6 million in 2010 (all amounts are net of RRB payments, which are included in financing activities on the accompanying consolidated statements of cash flows). The improved cash flows were due primarily to the addition of NSTAR, which contributed $450.8 million of operating cash flows (net of RRB payments) to NU since the date of the merger, April 10, 2012. Offsetting the favorable NSTAR cash flow impact was an increase of $100.6 million in cash disbursements made in 2012, compared to 2011, associated with CL&P, PSNH and WMECO storm restoration costs related to Tropical Storm Irene, the October 2011 snowstorm, and Hurricane Sandy, NUSCO Pension Plan cash contributions of $197.4 million in 2012, compared to $143.6 million in 2011, a total of $28 million of bill credits in 2012 to customers of CL&P and WMECO related to the merger, and $27 million in bill credits provided to CL&P residential customers in 2012 related to the October 2011 snowstorm. In addition, there were approximately $42 million of NU parent transaction cost payments related to the merger. The improved cash flows from 2010 to 2011 were due primarily to the impact of the CL&P and PSNH 2010 distribution rate case decisions that were effective July 1, 2010, the WMECO distribution rate case decision that was effective February 1, 2011, and income tax refunds of $76.6 million in 2011 largely attributable to accelerated depreciation tax benefits, compared to income tax payments of $84.5 million in 2010. Offsetting these benefits was $143.6 million of Pension Plan cash contributions in 2011, compared to $45 million in 2010, and approximately $157 million of cash disbursements made in 2011 associated with Tropical Storm Irene and the October snowstorm. 39 A summary of the current credit ratings and outlooks by Moody's, S&P and Fitch for senior unsecured debt of NU parent, NSTAR Electric, and WMECO and senior secured debt of CL&P and PSNH is as follows: Moody's S&P Fitch Current Outlook Current Outlook Current Outlook NU Parent Baa2 Stable BBB+ Stable BBB+ Stable CL&P A3 Stable A Stable A Stable NSTAR Electric A2 Stable A- Stable A+ Stable PSNH A3 Stable A Stable A Stable WMECO Baa2 Stable A- Stable A- Stable On February 14, 2013, S&P revised its criteria for rating utility first mortgage bonds, resulting in one-level upgrades of CL&P and PSNH first mortgage bonds by S&P. We paid common dividends of $375 million in 2012, compared with $194.6 million in 2011. This reflects an increase of approximately 17 percent in our common dividend beginning in the second quarter of 2012 following an increase of approximately 7 percent in the first quarter of 2012. On February 5, 2013, our Board of Trustees approved a common dividend payment of $0.3675 per share, payable March 28, 2013 to shareholders of record as of March 1, 2013. The dividend represented an increase of 7.1 percent over the $0.343 per share quarterly dividend paid in December 2012. In 2012, CL&P, NSTAR LLC, PSNH, and WMECO paid $100.5 million, $141 million, $90.7 million, and $9.4 million, respectively, in common dividends to NU parent. Since April 10, 2012, NSTAR Electric and NSTAR Gas have paid $159.9 million and $12 million, respectively, in common dividends to NSTAR LLC. NU parent made equity contributions to CL&P and WMECO of $25 million and $50 million, respectively. Cash capital expenditures included on the accompanying consolidated statements of cash flows and described in this "Liquidity" section do not include amounts incurred on capital projects but not yet paid, cost of removal, AFUDC related to equity funds, and the capitalized portions of pension and PBOP expense or income. A summary of our cash capital expenditures by company for the years ended December 31, 2012, 2011 and 2010 is as follows: For the Years Ended December 31, (Millions of Dollars) 2012 (1) 2011 2010 CL&P $ 449.1 $ 424.9 $ 380.3 NSTAR Electric 324.3 N/A N/A PSNH 203.9 241.8 296.3 WMECO 264.2 238.0 115.2 Natural Gas 148.7 98.2 82.5 NPT 33.5 24.9 7.5 Other 48.6 48.9 72.7 Total $ 1,472.3 $ 1,076.7 $ 954.5 (1) Cash capital expenditures include NSTAR from the date of merger, April 10, 2012, through December 31, 2012. The increase in our cash capital expenditures was the result of the addition of NSTAR capital expenditures, effective April 10, 2012, and higher transmission segment cash capital expenditures of $113.8 million, primarily at WMECO and CL&P. Business Development and Capital Expenditures Consolidated: Our consolidated capital expenditures, including amounts incurred but not paid, cost of removal, AFUDC, and the capitalized portions of pension and PBOP expense or income (all of which are non-cash factors), totaled $1.5 billion in 2012, $1.2 billion in 2011, and $1 billion in 2010. These amounts included $43.1 million in 2012, $51.9 million in 2011, and $68.7 million in 2010, related to our corporate service companies, NUSCO and RRR. 40 Transmission Business : Transmission business capital expenditures increased by $189.6 million in 2012, compared with 2011, due primarily to increases at CL&P and WMECO related to the construction of GSRP and the addition of NSTAR Electric's capital expenditures since April 10, 2012. A summary of transmission capital expenditures by company in 2012, 2011 and 2010 is as follows: For the Years Ended December 31, (Millions of Dollars) 2012 (1) 2011 2010 CL&P $ 182.5 $ 128.6 $ 107.2 NSTAR Electric 160.7 N/A N/A PSNH 55.7 68.1 49.1 WMECO 214.7 236.8 95.2 NPT 35.4 25.9 9.4 Total Transmission Segment $ 649.0 $ 459.4 $ 260.9 (1) Transmission capital expenditures include NSTAR Electric from the date of merger, April 10, 2012, through December 31, 2012. NEEWS: GSRP, a project that involves the construction of 115 kV and 345 kV overhead lines by CL&P and WMECO from Ludlow, Massachusetts to Bloomfield, Connecticut, is the first, largest and most complicated project within the NEEWS family of projects. The $718 million project is expected to be fully placed in service in late 2013. As of December 31, 2012, the project was approximately 93 percent complete and we have placed $298 million in service. The Interstate Reliability Project, which includes CL&P construction of an approximately 40-mile, 345 kV overhead line from Lebanon, Connecticut to the Connecticut-Rhode Island border in Thompson, Connecticut where it will connect to transmission enhancements being constructed by National Grid, is our second major NEEWS project. All siting applications have been filed by CL&P and National Grid. On January 2, 2013, the Connecticut Siting Council issued a final decision and order approving the Connecticut portion of the project. Decisions in Rhode Island and Massachusetts are expected between the end of 2013 and early 2014. The $218 million project is expected to be placed in service in late 2015. Included as part of NEEWS are associated reliability related projects, approximately $70 million of which have been placed in service and approximately $30 million of which are in various phases of construction and will continue to go into service through 2013. Through December 31, 2012, CL&P and WMECO had capitalized $212 million and $518.1 million, respectively, in costs associated with NEEWS, of which $79.4 million and $183.4 million, respectively, were capitalized in 2012. Greater Hartford Central Connecticut Project (GHCC): In August 2012, ISO-NE presented its preliminary needs analysis for the GHCC to the ISO-NE Planning Advisory Committee. The results showed severe thermal overloads and voltage violations in each of the four study areas now and in the near future. A combination of 345 kV and 115 kV transmission solutions are being considered to address these reliability concerns and a set of preferred solutions are expected to be identified by ISO-NE in 2013. Approximately $300 million has been included in our five-year capital program for future projects being identified to enhance these reliability concerns, which have recently been confirmed by ISO-NE. Cape Cod Reliability Projects: Transmission projects serving Cape Cod in the Southeastern Massachusetts (SEMA) reliability region consist of an expansion and upgrade of NSTAR Electric's existing transmission infrastructure including construction of a new 345 kV transmission line that will cross the Cape Cod Canal (The Lower SEMA Transmission Project) as well as a new 115kV transmission line and other 115kV upgrades in the center of Cape Cod. All regulatory and licensing and permitting is complete for the Lower SEMA Transmission Project. Construction commenced in September 2012 and is expected to be completed by mid-2013. The total estimated construction cost for the Cape Cod projects is approximately $150 million. Northern Pass: Northern Pass is NPT's planned HVDC transmission line from the Qu bec-New Hampshire border to Franklin, New Hampshire and an associated alternating current radial transmission line between Franklin and Deerfield, New Hampshire. Northern Pass will interconnect at the Qu bec-New Hampshire border with a planned HQ HVDC transmission line. Effective April 10, 2012, as a result of the merger, NUTV owned 100 percent of NPT. NPT has identified a new route in the northern-most part of the project route where PSNH did not own any rights of way. We expect to file the new route with the DOE in the first quarter of 2013, and we believe that NPT will be completed in early 2017. We estimate the costs of the Northern Pass transmission project will be approximately $1.2 billion (including capitalized AFUDC). Greater Boston Reliability and Boston Network Improvements: As a result of continued analysis of the transmission needs to enhance system reliability and improve capacity in eastern Massachusetts, NSTAR Electric expects to implement a series of new transmission initiatives over the next five years. We have included $479 million in our five-year capital program related to these initiatives. 41 Distribution Business : A summary of distribution capital expenditures by company for 2012, 2011 and 2010 is as follows: For the Year Ended December 31, (Millions of Dollars) 2012 (1) 2011 2010 CL&P: Basic Business $ 69.2 $ 166.6 $ 126.2 Aging Infrastructure 177.8 112.3 104.0 Load Growth 65.8 59.6 75.2 Total CL&P 312.8 338.5 305.4 NSTAR Electric: Basic Business 47.3 N/A N/A Aging Infrastructure 111.5 N/A N/A Load Growth 17.4 N/A N/A Total NSTAR Electric 176.2 N/A N/A PSNH: Basic Business 25.3 47.7 41.2 Aging Infrastructure 50.2 25.3 19.5 Load Growth 20.2 25.8 23.1 Total PSNH 95.7 98.8 83.8 WMECO: Basic Business 12.7 24.2 17.5 Aging Infrastructure 18.5 11.5 10.5 Load Growth 6.5 6.1 5.1 Total WMECO 37.7 41.8 33.1 Total - Electric Distribution (excluding Generation) 622.4 479.1 422.3 Total - Natural Gas 162.9 102.8 94.6 Other Distribution 0.1 1.0 2.0 Total Electric and Natural Gas 785.4 582.9 518.9 PSNH Generation: Clean Air Project 22.0 101.1 149.7 Other 7.9 23.7 27.4 Total PSNH Generation 29.9 124.8 177.1 WMECO Generation 0.7 11.7 10.1 Total Distribution Segment $ 816.0 $ 719.4 $ 706.1 (1) Distribution capital expenditures include NSTAR Electric and NSTAR Gas from the date of merger, April 10, 2012, through December 31, 2012. For the electric distribution business, basic business includes the relocation of plant, the purchase of meters, tools, vehicles, information technology, transformer replacements, and equipment facilities. Aging infrastructure relates to reliability and the replacement of overhead lines, plant substations, underground cable replacement, and equipment failures. Load growth includes requests for new business and capacity additions on distribution lines and substation overloads. Clean Air Project: In June 2012, PSNH placed into service the last major elements of the Clean Air Project at Merrimack Station, a $421 million project that is utilizing wet scrubber technology to significantly reduce mercury and sulfur emissions from the station two coal units. The scrubber has been operating since the end of September 2011 and has reduced mercury and sulfur emissions by more than 95 percent. CL&P System Resiliency Plan: On January 16, 2013, PURA approved the $300 million plan CL&P filed to improve the resiliency of its electric distribution system. Consistent with the terms of the Connecticut settlement agreement, the plan includes vegetation management (both enhanced tree trimming and trimming on a shorter cycle), structural hardening (strengthening field structures through upgrades to the current structure design and material standards as well as upgrades to the poles and conductors), and electrical hardening (upgrading electrical distribution conductors and protective devices on overhead circuits). CL&P expects to complete the plan in five years in two separate phases. Phase 1 of the plan, which will be primarily focused on vegetation management, is estimated to cost $32 million in 2013 and $53 million in 2014. Phase 2 of the plan is estimated to cost the remaining $215 million over the period from 2015 through 2017. 42 Projected Capital Expenditures : A summary of the projected capital expenditures for the Regulated companies' electric transmission business for 2013 through 2017 and for their distribution business for 2013 through 2015, including our corporate service companies' capital expenditures on behalf of the Regulated companies, is as follows: Year (Millions of Dollars) 2013 2014 2015 2016 2017 2013-2017 Total CL&P Transmission $ 193 $ 243 $ 157 $ 135 $ 89 $ 817 NSTAR Electric Transmission 211 198 278 222 248 1,157 PSNH Transmission 92 147 102 63 15 419 WMECO Transmission 95 102 77 11 2 287 NPT 45 84 235 394 447 1,205 Total Transmission $ 636 $ 774 $ 849 $ 825 $ 801 $ 3,885 Electric Distribution 670 648 635 Generation 30 30 34 Natural Gas 170 160 161 Total Distribution $ 870 $ 838 $ 830 Corporate Service Companies $ 84 $ 62 $ 55 Total $ 1,590 $ 1,674 $ 1,734 Actual capital expenditures could vary from the projected amounts for the companies and periods above. FERC Regulatory Issues FERC Base ROE Complaint: On September 30, 2011, several New England state attorneys general, state regulatory commissions, consumer advocates and other parties filed a joint complaint with the FERC under Sections 206 and 306 of the Federal Power Act alleging that the base ROE used in calculating formula rates for transmission service under the ISO-NE Open Access Transmission Tariff by New England transmission owners, including CL&P, NSTAR Electric, PSNH and WMECO, is unjust and unreasonable. The complainants asserted that the current 11.14 percent rate, which became effective in 2006, is excessive due to changes in the capital markets and are seeking an order to reduce the rate, which would be effective September 30, 2011 through December 31, 2012. In response, the New England transmission owners filed testimony and analysis based on standard FERC methodology and precedent, demonstrating that the base ROE of 11.14 percent remained just and reasonable. On May 3, 2012, the FERC issued an order establishing hearing and settlement procedures for the complaint. The settlement proceedings were subsequently terminated, as the parties had reached an impasse in their efforts to reach a settlement. In August 2012, the FERC trial judge assigned to the complaint established a schedule for the trial phase of the proceedings. Complainant testimony supporting a base ROE of 9 percent was filed on October 1, 2012. Additional testimony was filed on October 1, 2012 by a group of Massachusetts municipal electric companies, which recommended a base ROE of 8.2 percent. The New England transmission owners filed testimony and analysis on November 20, 2012, demonstrating they believe that the current base ROE continues to be just and reasonable. On January 18, 2013, the FERC trial staff filed testimony and analysis recommending a base ROE of 9.66 percent based on the midpoint of their analysis with a range of reasonableness of 6.82 percent to 12.51 percent. Hearings on this complaint are scheduled for May 2013 and a trial judge recommended decision is due in September 2013. A decision from FERC commissioners is expected in 2014. Refunds to customers, if any, as a result of a reduction in the NU transmission companies base ROE would be retroactive to October 1, 2011. On December 27, 2012, several additional parties filed a separate complaint concerning the New England transmission owners' base ROE with the FERC. This new complaint seeks to reduce the New England transmission owner base transmission ROE effective January 1, 2013, and to consolidate this new complaint with the joint complaint filed on September 30, 2011. The New England transmission owners have asked the FERC to reject this new complaint. The FERC has not yet acted on this request. As of December 31, 2012, CL&P, NSTAR Electric, PSNH, and WMECO had approximately $2.1 billion of aggregate shareholder equity invested in their transmission facilities. As a result, each 10 basis point change in the authorized base ROE would change annual consolidated earnings by an approximate $2.1 million. We cannot at this time predict the ultimate outcome of this proceeding or the estimated impact on CL&P s, NSTAR Electric s, PSNH s, or WMECO respective financial position, results of operations or cash flows. FERC Order No. 1000 : On October 25, 2012, ISO-NE and a majority of the New England transmission owners, including CL&P, NSTAR Electric, PSNH and WMECO, made a comprehensive compliance filing as required by FERC Order No. 1000 and Order No. 1000-A, issued on July 21, 2011 and May 17, 2012, respectively. The compliance filing first seeks to preserve the existing reliability planning process in New England, based on FERC previous approval of transmission owners rights under the Transmission Operating Agreement with ISO-NE, and the superiority of the current planning process, which has resulted in major transmission construction, large reliability benefits and reduction of market costs. The filing also contains a new process for public policy transmission planning that incorporates opportunities for competing, non-incumbent projects and cost allocation among the supporting states. In mid-January 2013, ISO-NE and the majority of New England transmission owners filed answers to various stakeholders that submitted protests to the compliance filing. We cannot predict the final outcome or impact on us; however implementation of FERC goals in New England, including within our service territories, may expose us to competition for construction of transmission projects, additional regulatory considerations, and potential delay with respect to future transmission projects. 43 Regulatory Developments and Rate Matters Federal: EPA Proposed NPDES Permit: PSNH maintains a NPDES permit consistent with requirements of the Clean Water Act for Merrimack Station. In 1997, PSNH filed in a timely manner for a renewal of this permit. As a result, the existing permit was administratively continued. On September 29, 2011, the EPA issued a draft renewal NPDES permit for PSNH's Merrimack Station for public review and comment. The proposed permit contains many significant conditions to future operation. The proposed permit would require PSNH to install a closed-cycle cooling system (including cooling towers) at the station. The EPA estimated that the net present value cost to install this system and operate it over a 20-year period would be approximately $112 million. On October 27, 2011, the EPA extended the initial 60-day period for public review and comment on the draft permit for an additional 90 days until February 28, 2012. PSNH and other electric utility groups filed thousands of pages of comments contesting EPA draft permit requirements. PSNH stated that the data and studies supplied to the EPA demonstrate the fact that a closed-cycle cooling system is not warranted. The EPA does not have a set deadline to consider comments and to issue a final permit. Merrimack Station is permitted to continue to operate under its present permit pending issuance of the final permit and subsequent resolution of matters appealed by PSNH and other parties. Due to the site specific characteristics of PSNH's other fossil generating stations, we believe it is unlikely that they would face similar permitting determinations. Major Storms: 2013, 2012 and 2011 Major Storms: On August 28, 2011, Tropical Storm Irene caused extensive damage to our distribution system. Approximately 800,000 CL&P, PSNH and WMECO customers were without power at the peak of the outages, with approximately 670,000 of those customers in Connecticut. Approximately 500,000 customer outages occurred on the NSTAR Electric distribution system in its aftermath. On October 29, 2011, an unprecedented storm inundated our service territory with heavy snow causing significant damage to our distribution and transmission systems. Approximately 1.2 million of CL&P, PSNH and WMECO electric distribution customers were without power at the peak of the outages, with 810,000 of those customers in Connecticut, 237,000 in New Hampshire, and 140,000 in western Massachusetts. In terms of customer outages, this was the most severe storm in CL&P history, surpassing Tropical Storm Irene; the third most severe in PSNH history; and the most severe in WMECO's history. The storm also caused approximately 200,000 customer outages on the NSTAR Electric distribution system. On October 29, 2012, Hurricane Sandy caused extensive damage to our electric distribution system across all three states. Approximately 1.5 million of our 3.1 million electric distribution customers were without power during or following the storm, with approximately 850,000 of those customers in Connecticut, approximately 472,000 in Massachusetts, and approximately 137,000 in New Hampshire. As of December 31, 2012, deferred storm restoration costs related to these major storms that are deferred for future recovery at CL&P, NSTAR Electric, PSNH, and WMECO were as follows: (Millions of Dollars) Tropical Storm Irene October Snowstorm Hurricane Sandy Total CL&P $ 108.6 $ 173.0 $ 159.9 $ 441.5 NSTAR Electric 21.9 13.9 27.8 63.6 PSNH 6.8 15.5 12.1 34.4 WMECO 3.2 23.3 4.2 30.7 Total $ 140.5 $ 225.7 $ 204.0 $ 570.2 On February 8, 2013, a blizzard caused damage to the electric delivery systems of CL&P and NSTAR Electric. We have estimated that approximately 71,000 and 350,000 of CL&P and NSTAR Electric's distribution customers, respectively, were without power during or following the storm. We believe that this storm will cost between $100 million to $120 million, with approximately 90 percent of those costs relating to NSTAR Electric. Management expects the costs to meet the criteria for specific cost recovery in Connecticut and Massachusetts and, as a result, does not expect the storm to have a material impact on the results of operations of CL&P or NSTAR Electric. Each operating company will seek recovery of these anticipated deferred storm costs through its applicable regulatory recovery process. The magnitude of these storms restoration costs and damages met the criteria for cost deferral in Connecticut, New Hampshire, and Massachusetts and as a result, the storms had no material impact on the results of operations of CL&P, NSTAR Electric, PSNH and WMECO. As covered by the Connecticut settlement agreement, CL&P agreed to forego recovery of $40 million (pre-tax) of the deferred storm restoration costs associated with Tropical Storm Irene and the October 2011 snowstorm. We believe our response to all storms was prudent and therefore we believe it is probable that CL&P, NSTAR Electric, PSNH and WMECO will be allowed to recover the deferred storm restoration costs. Each operating company will seek recovery of its estimated deferred storm restoration costs through its applicable regulatory recovery process. 44 Connecticut: Standard Service and Last Resort Service Rates: CL&P's residential and small commercial customers who do not choose competitive suppliers are served under SS rates, and large commercial and industrial customers who do not choose competitive suppliers are served under LRS rates. Effective January 1, 2013, the PURA approved a decrease to CL&P total average SS rate of approximately 4.5 percent and an increase to CL&P total average LRS rate of approximately 15.3 percent. The energy supply portion of the total average SS rate decreased from 8.443 cents per kWh to 7.68 cents per kWh while the energy supply portion of the total average LRS rate increased from 6.06 cents per kWh to 7.679 cents per kWh. These changes were due primarily to the market conditions for the procurement of energy. CL&P is fully recovering from customers the costs of its SS and LRS services. CTA and SBC Reconciliation : On December 12, 2012, PURA approved CL&P 2011 CTA and SBC reconciliation as filed on March 30, 2012, which compared CTA and SBC revenues to revenue requirements. Prospectively, PURA has required CL&P to include only the billed revenues when filing its future CTA and SBC reconciliations. This adjustment to the filing will have no impact to CL&P financial position, results of operations or cash flows. CL&P will file its 2012 CTA and SBC reconciliation in March 2013. FMCC Filing: Semi-annually, CL&P files with PURA its FMCC filing, which reconciles actual FMCC revenues and charges and GSC revenues and expenses, for the six-month period under consideration. The filing identifies a total net over or under recovery, which includes the remaining uncollected or non-refunded portions from previous filings. On February 22, 2013, CL&P filed with PURA its semi-annual FMCC filing for the period July 1, 2012 through December 31, 2012. This filing also reflects the January 1, 2012 through June 30, 2012 amounts as approved by PURA in the previous semi-annual filing. The filing identified a total net over recovery of $7.9 million for the period. PURA has not established a schedule for review of this filing, however, we do not expect the outcome of the PURA's review to have a material adverse impact on CL&P's financial position, results of operations or cash flows. Conservation Adjustment Mechanism: On November 7, 2012, CL&P filed an application with PURA for the establishment of a CAM. The CAM would collect the costs associated with expanded energy efficiency programs beyond that already collected through the statutory charge and the revenues lost because of the expanded energy efficiency programs. Procurement Fee Rate Proceedings: In prior years, CL&P submitted to the PURA its proposed methodology to calculate the variable incentive portion of its transition service procurement fee, which was effective for the years 2004, 2005 and 2006, and requested approval of the pre-tax $5.8 million 2004 incentive fee. At the time, CL&P had not recorded amounts related to the 2005 and 2006 procurement fee in earnings. CL&P recovered the $5.8 million pre-tax amount, which was recorded in 2005 earnings, through a CTA reconciliation process. On January 15, 2009, the PURA issued a final decision in this docket reversing its December 2005 draft decision and stated that CL&P was not eligible for the procurement incentive compensation for 2004. A $5.8 million pre-tax charge (approximately $3.5 million net of tax) was recorded in the 2008 earnings of CL&P, and an obligation to refund the $5.8 million to customers was established as of December 31, 2008. CL&P filed an appeal of this decision on February 26, 2009. On February 4, 2010, the Connecticut Superior Court reversed the PURA decision. The Court remanded the case back to the PURA for the correction of several specific errors. On February 22, 2010, the PURA appealed the Connecticut Superior Court February 4, 2010 decision to the Connecticut Appellate Court, which then transferred the appeal to the Connecticut Supreme Court. In lieu of a decision from the Connecticut Supreme Court, the parties involved, including CL&P, agreed to resolve all issues associated with the 2004, 2005 and 2006 procurement fee and settle the matter. On October 2, 2012, the PURA issued a decision approving the parties joint settlement agreement. As a result of the joint settlement agreement, CL&P is allowed to retain $11.5 million of procurement incentives for the years 2004, 2005 and 2006. PURA Storm Review: On August 1, 2012, PURA issued a final decision in the investigation of CL&P performance related to both Tropical Storm Irene and the October 2011 snowstorm. The decision concluded that CL&P was deficient and inadequate in its preparation, response, and communication in both storms, and identified certain penalties that could be imposed on CL&P during its next rate case, including a reduction in allowed regulatory ROE and the disallowance of certain deferred storm restoration costs. However, PURA will consider and weigh the extent to which CL&P has taken steps in its restructuring of storm management and the establishment of new practices for execution in future storm response in determining any potential penalties. We believe such steps to improve current storm preparation and response practices have been successfully executed in recent storms. At this time, we cannot estimate the impact on CL&P financial position, results of operations or cash flows. We continue to believe that CL&P's response to these 2011 storms was prudent and consistent with industry standards, and that it is probable that it will be able to recover its deferred costs. System Resiliency Plan: On January 16, 2013, PURA approved the $300 million plan CL&P filed on July 9, 2012 to improve the resiliency of the CL&P electric distribution system. For further information, see "Business Development and Capital Expenditures Distribution Business" in this Management's Discussion and Analysis. PURA Establishment of Performance Standards for Electric and Gas Companies Docket: On November 1, 2012, PURA issued its report to the Connecticut legislature concerning specific standards for acceptable performance for electric and gas companies under emergency situations. Emergency situations were defined as more than 10 percent of electric customers and 1 percent of gas customers being without service for more than 48 consecutive hours. The performance standards the electric and gas companies, including CL&P and Yankee Gas, were directed to incorporate into their emergency response plans (ERP), and implement into their operations, include (1) the National Incident Management System and utilization of the Incident Command System, (2) scalable action and trigger points for various levels of outages, (3) a damage assessment model and mode of delivery, (4) guidelines for setting 45 restoration priorities, (5) a description of how the utility will insure safety for the public and utility employees, (6) a storm matrix for various storm levels that identify the mutual aid and/or contractor resources necessary to restore customers within a prescribed period of time, (7) written communication protocols for timely and accurate information exchange between the EDC and a pre-determined list of state and local agencies and other utilities during emergency events, (8) training and drills/exercises to be conducted annually on a local level and every 3 years on a state-wide level, and (9) a written report to be filed with PURA within 60 days after the end of an event in order to assist in lessons learned and continual improvement. Electric and gas companies, including CL&P and Yankee Gas, will be subject to penalties levied by PURA for failure to meet these performance standards. Massachusetts: Basic Service Rates: Electric distribution companies in Massachusetts are required to obtain and resell power to retail customers through Basic Service for those customers who choose not to buy energy from a competitive energy supplier. Basic Service rates are reset every six months (every three months for large commercial and industrial customers). The price of Basic Service is intended to reflect the average competitive market price for electric power. NSTAR Electric and WMECO fully recover their energy costs through DPU-approved regulatory rate mechanisms. DPU Storm Penalties: On December 11, 2012, in separate orders issued by the DPU, NSTAR Electric and WMECO received penalties related to the investigation into the electric utilities responses to Tropical Storm Irene and the October 2011 snowstorm. The DPU ordered penalties of $4.1 million and $2 million for NSTAR Electric and WMECO, respectively, stating that NSTAR Electric failed to communicate and prioritize restoration efforts in both storms and WMECO failed to prioritize restoration efforts in the October snowstorm. These penalties were ordered to be assessed in the form of customer credits in 2013. On December 28, 2012, NSTAR Electric and WMECO each filed appeals with the SJC arguing the DPU penalties should be vacated. In their filings, NSTAR Electric and WMECO stated that the DPU decision to assess the penalties was in error as the assessments were arbitrary and not supported by substantial evidence. While we believe that NSTAR Electric and WMECO should ultimately prevail upon appeal, we are unable to conclusively state that a favorable outcome is probable. Therefore, NSTAR Electric and WMECO recorded $4.1 million and $2 million, respectively, in pre-tax penalty charges as of December 31, 2012. DPU Safety and Reliability Programs (CPSL): Since 2006, NSTAR Electric has been recovering incremental costs related to the Double Pole Inspection, Replacement/Restoration and Transfer Program and the Underground Electric Safety Program, which included stray-voltage remediation, manhole inspections, repairs, and upgrades, in accordance with this DPU approved program. Recovery of these CPSL costs is subject to review and approval by the DPU through a rate-reconciling mechanism. From 2006 through December 31, 2011, cumulative costs associated with the CPSL program resulted in an incremental revenue requirement to customers of approximately $83 million. These amounts included incremental operations and maintenance costs and the related revenue requirement for specific capital investments relative to the CPSL programs. On May 28, 2010, the DPU issued an order on NSTAR Electric 2006 CPSL cost recovery filing (the May 2010 Order). The May 2010 Order was the basis NSTAR Electric used for recognizing revenue for the CPSL programs. On October 8, 2010, NSTAR Electric submitted a Compliance Filing with the DPU reconciling the cumulative CPSL program activity for the periods 2006 through 2009 in order to determine a proposed rate adjustment effective on January 1, 2011. The DPU allowed the proposed rates for the CPSL programs to go into effect on that date, subject to final reconciliation of CPSL program costs through a future DPU proceeding. NSTAR Electric updated the October 2010 filing with final activity through 2011 in February 2013. NSTAR Electric cannot predict the timing of any subsequent DPU order related to its CPSL filings for the period 2006 through 2011. Therefore, NSTAR Electric continued to record its 2006 through 2011 revenues under the CPSL programs based on the May 2010 Order. While we do not believe that any subsequent DPU order would result in revenue recognition that is materially different than the amounts already recognized, it is reasonably possible that an order could have a material impact on NSTAR Electric results of operations, financial position and cash flows. The April 4, 2012 DPU-approved comprehensive merger settlement agreement with the Massachusetts Attorney General concerning the Merger stipulates that NSTAR Electric must incur a revenue requirement of at least $15 million per year for 2012 through 2015 in order to continue these programs. CPSL revenues will end once NSTAR Electric has recovered its 2015-related CPSL costs. Realization of these revenues is subject to maintaining certain performance metrics over the four-year period and DPU approval. As of December 31, 2012, NSTAR Electric was in compliance with the performance metrics and has recognized the entire $15 million revenue requirement during 2012, which we believe is probable of approval from the DPU. Basic Service Bad Debt Adder: In accordance with a generic DPU order, electric utilities in Massachusetts recover the energy-related portion of bad debt costs in their Basic Service rates. On February 7, 2007, NSTAR Electric filed its 2006 Basic Service reconciliation with the DPU proposing an adjustment related to the increase of its Basic Service bad debt charge-offs. On June 28, 2007, the DPU issued an order approving the implementation of a revised Basic Service rate. However, the DPU instructed NSTAR Electric to reduce distribution rates by an amount equal to the increase in its Basic Service bad debt charge-offs. This adjustment to NSTAR Electric distribution rates would eliminate the fully reconciling nature of the Basic Service bad debt adder. NSTAR Electric deferred the unrecovered costs associated with energy-related bad debt as a regulatory asset, which totaled approximately $34 million as of December 31, 2011, as NSTAR Electric had concluded that these costs were probable of recovery in future rates. On June 18, 2010, NSTAR Electric filed an appeal of the DPU order with the SJC, which was heard by the SJC in 46 December 2011. On April 11, 2012, the SJC issued a procedural order waiving its standing 130-day rule for issuance of an order on the matter. Due to the delay, NSTAR Electric concluded that while an ultimate outcome on the matter in its favor remained more likely than not, it could no longer be deemed probable. As a result, NSTAR Electric recognized a reserve of $28 million ($17 million after-tax) as a charge to Operations and Maintenance in the first quarter of 2012 to reserve the related regulatory asset on its balance sheet. On June 4, 2012, the SJC vacated the DPU's June 28, 2007 order and remanded the matter to the DPU for a "statement of reasons, including subsidiary findings, of its conclusion of law and relevant facts." The continued uncertainty of the outcome of the DPU proceeding leaves NU and NSTAR Electric unable to conclude that it is probable that the previously reserved amount will ultimately be recovered and therefore NSTAR Electric will continue to maintain a reserve on this amount until the ultimate outcome is determined by the DPU. Renewable Energy Contract: On November 26, 2012, the DPU approved NSTAR Electric renewable energy contract with Cape Wind Associates, LLC, which has a term of 15 years, to purchase 129 MW of renewable energy from an offshore wind energy facility once it is constructed and placed in service. New Hampshire: Distribution Rates : In 2012, PSNH filed for a step increase and a change in its accrual to its major storm reserve fund. On June 27, 2012, the NHPUC approved an annualized distribution rate increase of $7.1 million, effective July 1, 2012, for the step increase. Additionally, PSNH was allowed a $3.5 million increase in the annual accrual to its major storm reserve fund effective July 1, 2012. ES and SCRC Rates: On December 12, 2012, PSNH filed an updated request to its September 28, 2012 preliminary request with the NHPUC to adjust its ES and SCRC rates effective with services rendered on and after January 1, 2013. PSNH updated request proposed to increase the current ES billing rate to reflect projected costs for 2013 and to decrease the current SCRC billing rate to reflect the full amortization of RRBs at the end of April 2013. The net impact to customers that purchase energy from PSNH is a net increase of 1.287 cents per kWh in total rates. On December 28, 2012, the NHPUC approved the request. ES Temporary Rates: On November 22, 2011, the NHPUC opened a docket to review the Clean Air Project including the establishment of temporary rates for near-term recovery of Clean Air Project costs, a prudence review of PSNH's overall construction program, and establishment of permanent rates for recovery of prudently incurred Clean Air Project costs. On April 10, 2012, the NHPUC issued an order authorizing temporary rates, effective April 16, 2012, which recover a significant portion of the Clean Air Project costs, including a return on equity. The docket will continue for a comprehensive prudence review of the Clean Air Project and the establishment of a permanent rate. The temporary rates will remain in effect until a permanent rate allowing full recovery of all prudently incurred costs is approved. At that time, the NHPUC will reconcile recoveries collected under the temporary rates with final approved rates. The NHPUC had suspended the procedural schedule for the prudence review pending issuance of an order on preliminary substantive and procedural matters. On December 24, 2012, the NHPUC issued an Order ruling on the requirement of PSNH to respond to a number of discovery requests that PSNH had objected to, and deciding that PSNH had legal authority to seek a variance from the Clean Air Project Mandate in the event of "economic infeasibility." PSNH has sought rehearing of that December 24 th Order. The NHPUC is considering PSNH rehearing request, and has again suspended the procedural schedule. PSNH expects hearings to commence in this proceeding on or about the third quarter of 2013. We cannot predict the outcome of the Clean Air Project prudence review, but believe all costs were incurred appropriately and are probable of recovery. ES Filing : On July 26, 2011, the NHPUC ordered PSNH to file a rate proposal that would mitigate the impact of customer migration expected to occur when the ES rate is higher than market prices. On January 26, 2012, the NHPUC rejected the PSNH proposal and ordered PSNH to file a new proposal no later than June 30, 2012, addressing certain issues raised by the NHPUC. On April 27, 2012, PSNH filed its proposed Alternative Default Energy Rate that addresses customer migration, with an effective date of July 1, 2012. The proposal, if implemented, would result in no impact to earnings and would allow for an increased contribution to fixed costs for all ES customers. On May 24, 2012, the NHPUC suspended the effectiveness of the proposed rates pending hearings. Hearings were held on October and November 2012 and a final decision is expected in the first quarter of 2013. Default ES Rate: On January 18, 2013, the NHPUC opened a docket to investigate market conditions affecting PSNH energy service rate, how PSNH will maintain just and reasonable rates in light of those conditions, and any impact of PSNH generation ownership on the New Hampshire competitive electric market. The NHPUC noted that this proceeding will not undertake to determine whether continued ownership and operation of generation is in PSNH retail customers economic interest. No schedule or procedural process has been established for this proceeding. Legislative and Policy Matters Federal: Moving Ahead for Progress in the 21st Century Act: On July 6, 2012, President Obama signed the "Moving Ahead for Progress in the 21 st Century" Act, which included provisions that impact how minimum required contributions to qualified pension plans are calculated. The legislation allows NU to use a higher discount rate to calculate the plan's funded target liability, resulting in lower cash contribution 47 requirements. We have evaluated the impact of the legislation on future cash contributions to the NUSCO and NSTAR Pension Plans and will continue to follow our policy to fund these plans on an annual basis that is at least equal to the amounts that will satisfy the federal requirements, as amended by this legislation. 2013 Legislation : On January 2, 2013, President Obama signed into law the "American Taxpayer Relief Act of 2012," which extends certain tax rules allowing the accelerated deduction of depreciation from the "American Recovery and Reinvestment Act of 2009" to businesses through 2013. This extended stimulus is expected to provide us with cash flow benefits of between $200 million to $250 million in 2013 and 2014. We are still evaluating the other provisions of this legislation, which are not expected to have a significant impact on our financial position, results of operations or cash flows. Connecticut: Enhancing Emergency Preparedness and Response Act : On June 15, 2012, Connecticut enacted the "Enhancing Emergency Preparedness and Response Act," which is intended to enhance the state emergency preparedness and response in the event of natural disasters. Among numerous provisions, the bill requires the PURA to establish emergency performance standards for utilities and allows the PURA to levy penalties of up to 2.5 percent of annual distribution revenues for failure to meet performance standards. For further information, see "Regulatory Developments and Rate Matters Connecticut" in this Management's Discussion and Analysis. Comprehensive Energy Strategy : On February 19, 2013, Connecticut issued a final comprehensive energy strategy (strategy). The strategy includes a series of policy proposals that aim to expand energy choices, improve environmental conditions, create clean energy jobs, and enhance the quality of life for customers in the state. It also includes a seven-year initiative for expanding natural gas use with a goal of providing nearly 300,000 utility customers with access to natural gas, building an estimated 900 miles of new natural gas mains, and estimates of capital costs to be incurred by natural gas utility companies to connect customers on or near natural gas mains. In addition to natural gas expansion, the strategy also calls for a significant expansion of energy efficiency investment in Connecticut, a review of Connecticut Renewable Energy Portfolio Standards (possibly including Canadian hydroelectric generation as a qualifying resource), and investment in alternative fuel transportation. Many of the recommendations in the strategy will require actions by the PURA and potentially the legislature. As such, the full impact of the strategy is not reflected in our electric distribution, transmission or natural gas business segments five-year capital program. Massachusetts: Energy Act : On August 3, 2012, Massachusetts Governor Patrick signed into law "An Act Relative to Competitively Priced Electricity in the Commonwealth" (Energy Act). The more significant provisions of the Energy Act impacting our Massachusetts operating companies and customers are as follows: Requires electric utility companies to file a distribution rate case every five years and natural gas companies every 10 years, limiting those companies to one settlement agreement in a 10-year period; Extends the distribution rate case review period to 10 months; Requires all distribution companies, through a competitive bidding process and subject to DPU approval, to enter into additional cost-effective long-term renewable energy contracts with terms of 10 to 20 years. Electric utility companies will be allowed a remuneration of 2.75 percent of the annual payments under the contracts to compensate them for accepting the financial obligation of the contracts; Orders the DPU to open a proceeding for each electric and natural gas utility company to identify reconciliation factors and establish cost recovery from each customer class under cost-based criteria; and Allows electric utility or distribution companies to construct, own and operate no more than 25 MW of solar generation facilities, a decrease from the initial allowance of up to 50 MW of solar generation facilities, subject to DPU approval, and requires that construction be completed prior to June 30, 2015. Storm Response Act : On August 6, 2012, Massachusetts Governor Patrick signed into law "an act relative to emergency service response of public utility companies" (Storm Response Act), to help improve utility companies emergency response and communication. The Storm Response Act codified certain emergency response plan (ERP) provisions, which require utility companies to submit an annual ERP for DPU review and approval. The ERP will describe storm or emergency responsibilities of utility company employees, customer communication processes and systems, and deployment of resources. The Storm Response Act also requires that all future financial penalties levied on utility companies by the DPU for violation of DPU storm and emergency service performance standards will be provided to customers, and that transmission companies performing vegetation management activities within a right-of-way comply with certain notification provisions. We are currently evaluating this act and its potential impacts on NSTAR Electric s, NSTAR Gas and WMECO financial positions, results of operations and cash flows; however, we do not expect the impacts to be material. Critical Accounting Policies The preparation of financial statements in conformity with GAAP requires management to make estimates, assumptions and, at times, difficult, subjective or complex judgments. Changes in these estimates, assumptions and judgments, in and of themselves, could materially impact our financial position, results of operations or cash flows. Our management communicates to and discusses with the Audit Committee of our Board of Trustees significant matters relating to critical accounting policies. Our critical accounting policies are 48 discussed below. See the combined notes to our consolidated financial statements for further information concerning the accounting policies, estimates and assumptions used in the preparation of our consolidated financial statements. Regulatory Accounting: The accounting policies of the Regulated companies conform to GAAP applicable to rate-regulated enterprises and reflect the effects of the rate-making process. The application of accounting guidance applicable to rate-regulated enterprises results in recording regulatory assets and liabilities. Regulatory assets represent the deferral of incurred costs that are probable of future recovery in customer rates. In some cases, we record regulatory assets before approval for recovery has been received from the applicable regulatory commission. We must use judgment to conclude that costs deferred as regulatory assets are probable of future recovery. We base our conclusion on certain factors, including, but not limited to, regulatory precedent. Regulatory liabilities represent revenues received from customers to fund expected costs that have not yet been incurred or probable future refunds to customers. We use our best judgment when recording regulatory assets and liabilities; however, regulatory commissions can reach different conclusions about the recovery of costs, and those conclusions could have a material impact on our consolidated financial statements. We believe it is probable that the Regulated companies will recover the regulatory assets that have been recorded. If we determined that we could no longer apply the accounting guidance applicable to rate-regulated enterprises to our operations, or that we could not conclude that it is probable that costs would be recovered or reflected in future rates, the costs would be charged to earnings in the period in which the determination is made. For further information, see Note 3, "Regulatory Accounting," to the consolidated financial statements. Unbilled Revenues: The determination of retail energy sales to residential, commercial and industrial customers is based on the reading of meters, which occurs regularly throughout the month. Billed revenues are based on these meter readings and the majority of recorded annual revenues is based on actual billings. Because customers are billed throughout the month based on pre-determined cycles rather than on a calendar month basis, an estimate of electricity or natural gas delivered to customers for which the customers have not yet been billed is calculated as of the balance sheet date. Unbilled revenues represent an estimate of electricity or natural gas delivered to customers but not yet billed. Unbilled revenues are included in Operating Revenues on the statement of income and are assets on the balance sheet that are reclassified to Accounts Receivable in the following month as customers are billed. Such estimates are subject to adjustment when actual meter readings become available, when there is a change in estimates and under other circumstances. The Regulated companies estimate unbilled sales monthly using the daily load cycle method. The daily load cycle method allocates billed sales to the current calendar month based on the daily load for each billing cycle. The billed sales are subtracted from total month load, net of delivery losses, to estimate unbilled sales. Unbilled revenues are estimated by first allocating unbilled sales to the respective customer classes, then applying an estimated rate by customer class to those sales. The estimate of unbilled revenues is sensitive to numerous factors, such as energy demands, weather and changes in the composition of customer classes that can significantly impact the amount of revenues recorded. For further information, see Note 1K, "Summary of Significant Accounting Policies - Revenues," to the consolidated financial statements. Pension and PBOP: NUSCO and NSTAR Electric sponsor pension plans covering certain of our employees. In addition, NUSCO and NSTAR Electric & Gas sponsor PBOP plans to provide certain health care benefits, primarily medical and dental, and life insurance benefits to retired employees. For each of these plans, the development of the benefit obligation, funded status and net periodic benefit cost is based on several significant assumptions. We evaluate these assumptions at least annually and adjust them as necessary. Changes in these assumptions could have a material impact on our financial position, results of operations or cash flows. Pre-tax net periodic benefit expense (excluding SERP) for the Pension Plans was $234.9 million, $127.7 million and $80.4 million for the years ended December 31, 2012, 2011 and 2010, respectively. The pre-tax net periodic benefit expense for the PBOP Plans was $72.3 million, $43.6 million and $41.6 million for the years ended December 31, 2012, 2011 and 2010, respectively. NSTAR pension and PBOP expense is included in NU consolidated amounts from the date of the merger, April 10, 2012, through December 31, 2012. We develop key assumptions for purposes of measuring liabilities as of December 31 st and expenses for the subsequent year. These assumptions include the long-term rate of return on plan assets, discount rate, compensation/progression rate, and health care cost trend rates and are discussed below. Long-Term Rate of Return on Plan Assets : In developing this assumption, we consider historical and expected returns and input from our actuaries and consultants. Our expected long-term rate of return on assets is based on assumptions regarding target asset allocations and corresponding expected rates of return for each asset class. We routinely review the actual asset allocations and periodically rebalance the investments to the targeted asset allocations when appropriate. For the year ended December 31, 2012, our aggregate expected long-term rate of return assumptions of 8.25 percent on the NUSCO Pension and PBOP Plans and 7.30 percent for the NSTAR Pension and PBOP Plans were used to determine our Pension and PBOP expense. For the forecasted 2013 pension 49 and PBOP expense, our expected long-term rate of return of 8.25 percent for all plans was used, which reflects a change in target asset allocations within both the NUSCO and NSTAR Pension and PBOP Plans. Discount Rate : Payment obligations related to the Pension Plans and PBOP Plans are discounted at interest rates applicable to the expected timing of each plan cash flows. The discount rate that is utilized in determining the pension and PBOP obligations is based on a yield-curve approach. This approach is based on a population of bonds with an average rating of AA based on bond ratings by Moody s, S&P and Fitch, and uses bonds with above median yields within that population. The discount rates determined on this basis are 4.24 percent for the NUSCO Pension Plan, 4.13 percent for the NSTAR Pension Plan, 4.04 percent for the NUSCO PBOP Plans and 4.35 percent for the NSTAR PBOP Plan as of December 31, 2012. Compensation/Progression Rate : This assumption reflects the expected long-term salary growth rate, which impacts the estimated benefits that pension plan participants receive in the future. We used a compensation/progression rate of 3.5 percent as of December 31, 2012 and 2011 for the NUSCO Pension Plan and 4 percent for the NSTAR Pension Plan as of December 31, 2012, which reflects our current expectation of future salary increases, including consideration of the levels of increases built into collective bargaining agreements. Actuarial Determination of Expense : Pension and PBOP expense is determined by our actuaries and consists of service cost and prior service cost, interest cost based on the discounting of the obligations, amortization of actuarial gains and losses and amortization of the net transition obligation, offset by the expected return on plan assets. Actuarial gains and losses represent differences between assumptions and actual information or updated assumptions. We determine the expected return on plan assets for the NUSCO Pension and PBOP Plans by applying our assumed rate of return to a four-year rolling average of plan asset fair values, which reduces year-to-year volatility. This calculation recognizes investment gains or losses over a four-year period from the years in which they occur. Investment gains or losses for this purpose are the difference between the calculated expected return and the actual return or loss based on the change in the fair value of assets during the year. As of December 31, 2012, investment gains and losses that remain to be reflected in the calculation of plan assets over the next four years were losses of $224.4 million and gains of $0.7 million for the NUSCO Pension Plan and PBOP Plans, respectively. As investment gains and losses are reflected in the average plan asset fair values, they are subject to amortization with other unrecognized actuarial gains or losses. The plans currently amortize unrecognized actuarial gains or losses as a component of pension and PBOP expense over the average future employee service period. As of December 31, 2012, the net unrecognized actuarial losses on the NUSCO Pension and PBOP Plan liabilities were $1.1 billion and $176.5 million, respectively. For the NSTAR Pension and PBOP Plans, the entire difference between the actual and expected return on plan assets as of December 31, 2012 is immediately reflected as a component of unrecognized actuarial gains or losses to be amortized over the estimated average future service period of the employees. As of December 31, 2012, the net unrecognized actuarial losses on the NSTAR Pension and PBOP Plan liabilities were approximately $724 million and $176 million, respectively. Forecasted Expenses and Expected Contributions : Based upon the assumptions and methodologies discussed above, we estimate that the combined expense for the Pension and PBOP Plans will be $241 million and $46 million, respectively, in 2013. Pension and PBOP expense for subsequent years will depend on future investment performance, changes in future discount rates and other assumptions, and various other factors related to the populations participating in the plans. Pension and PBOP expense charged to earnings is net of the amounts capitalized. We expect to continue our policy to contribute to the NUSCO PBOP Plans at the amount of PBOP expense excluding any curtailments and the NSTAR PBOP Plan at an amount that approximates benefit payments. NU's policy is to fund the Pension Plans annually in an amount at least equal to an amount that will satisfy the federal requirements. NU made contributions to the NUSCO Pension Plan totaling $197.4 million in 2012, of which $87.7 million was contributed by PSNH. NSTAR Electric contributed $25 million to the NSTAR Pension Plan in 2012. Our Pension Plan funded ratio (the value of plan assets divided by the funding target in accordance with the requirements and guidelines of the PPA) was 94.8 percent and 100.2 percent as of January 1, 2012 for the NUSCO Pension Plan and NSTAR Pension Plan, respectively. We currently estimate that aggregate contributions of $285 million to the Pension Plans will be made in 2013. Fluctuations in the average discount rate used to calculate expected contributions to the Pension Plans can have a significant impact on the amounts. Sensitivity Analysis : The following represents the hypothetical increase to the Pension Plans (excluding SERP) and PBOP Plans reported annual cost as a result of a change in the following assumptions by 50 basis points: Pension Plan Cost PBOP Plan Cost (Millions of Dollars) As of December 31, Assumption Change 2012 2011 2012 2011 NU Consolidated Lower long-term rate of return $ 15.0 $ 10.3 $ 3.1 $ 1.3 Lower discount rate $ 22.0 $ 14.2 $ 6.7 $ 2.3 Higher compensation increase $ 10.4 $ 6.5 N/A N/A NSTAR Plans Lower long-term rate of return $ 4.8 N/A $ 1.7 N/A Lower discount rate $ 6.8 N/A $ 4.1 N/A Higher compensation increase $ 3.6 N/A N/A N/A 50 Changes in pension and PBOP costs would not impact net income for the NSTAR Plans as their expenses are fully recovered in rates, which reconcile each year relative to the change in costs. Health Care Cost : For the NUSCO PBOP Plans, the health care cost trend rate assumption is 7 percent, subsequently decreasing by 50 basis points per year to an ultimate rate of 5 percent in 2017. For the NSTAR PBOP Plan, the health care cost trend rate is 7.10 percent, subsequently decreasing to an ultimate rate of 4.50 percent in 2024. The effect of a hypothetical increase in the health care cost trend rate by one percentage point would be to have increased service and interest cost components of PBOP Plan expense by $8.9 million in 2012, with a $126.5 million impact on the postretirement benefit obligation. See Note 10A, "Employee Benefits - Pension Benefits and Postretirement Benefits Other Than Pensions," to the consolidated financial statements for more information. Goodwill: We recorded approximately $3.2 billion of goodwill associated with the merger with NSTAR on April 10, 2012. NU had existing goodwill of $0.3 billion related to Yankee Gas. NU has identified its reporting units for purposes of allocating goodwill as Electric Distribution, Electric Transmission and Natural Gas Distribution. Our reporting units for purposes of allocating and testing goodwill are consistent with our operating segments underlying our reportable segments. Electric Distribution and Electric Transmission reporting units include values for the respective components of CL&P, NSTAR Electric, PSNH and WMECO. The Natural Gas reporting unit includes the carrying values of NSTAR Gas and Yankee Gas. We are required to test goodwill balances for impairment at least annually by applying a fair value-based test that requires us to use estimates and judgment. We have selected October 1 st of each year as the annual goodwill impairment testing date. Goodwill impairment is deemed to exist if the carrying value of a reporting unit exceeds its estimated fair value and if the implied fair value of goodwill based on the estimated fair value of the reporting unit is less than the carrying amount of the goodwill. If goodwill were deemed to be impaired, it would be written down in the current period to the extent of the impairment. We performed an impairment analysis as of October 1, 2012 for the Electric Distribution, Electric Transmission and Natural Gas Distribution reporting units. We determined that the fair value of the reporting units substantially exceeded the carrying values and no impairment exists. In performing the evaluation, we estimated the fair values of the reporting units and compared them to the carrying values of the reporting units, including goodwill. We estimated the fair values of the reporting units using a discounted cash flow approach and a market approach that analyzed company information and market transactions. This evaluation requires the input of several critical assumptions, including cash flow projections, operating cost escalation rates, rates of return, future growth rates, a risk-adjusted discount rate, long-term earnings and merger multiples of comparable companies. We determine the discount rate using the capital asset pricing model methodology. This methodology uses a weighted average cost of capital in which the ROE is developed using risk-free rates, equity premiums and a beta representing the reporting unit volatility relative to the overall market. The resulting discount rate is intended to be comparable to a rate that would be applied by a market participant. The discount rate may change from year to year as it is based on external market conditions. The 2012 goodwill impairment analysis resulted in a significant excess of fair value of our reporting units over the carrying value. The estimated fair value of our reporting units is sensitive to changes in assumptions, such as discount rates, peer company financial results, recent market transactions and forecasted cash flows. Income Taxes: Income tax expense is estimated annually for each of the jurisdictions in which we operate. This process involves estimating current and deferred income tax expense or benefit and the impact of temporary differences resulting from differing treatment of items for financial reporting and income tax return reporting purposes. Such differences are the result of timing of the deduction for expenses, as well as any impact of permanent differences, non-tax deductible expenses, or other items, including items that directly impact our tax return as a result of a regulatory activity (flow-through items). The temporary differences and flow-through items result in deferred tax assets and liabilities that are included in the consolidated balance sheets. The income tax estimation process impacts all of our segments. We record income tax expense quarterly using an estimated annualized effective tax rate. A reconciliation of expected tax expense at the statutory federal income tax rate to actual tax expense recorded is included in Note 11, "Income Taxes," to the consolidated financial statements. We also account for uncertainty in income taxes, which applies to all income tax positions previously filed in a tax return and income tax positions expected to be taken in a future tax return that have been reflected on our balance sheets. We follow generally accepted accounting principles to address the methodology to be used in recognizing, measuring and classifying the amounts associated with tax positions that are deemed to be uncertain, including related interest and penalties. The determination of whether a tax position meets the recognition threshold under this guidance is based on facts and circumstances available to us. Once a tax position meets the recognition threshold, the tax benefit is measured using a cumulative probability assessment. Assigning probabilities in measuring a recognized tax position and evaluating new information or events in subsequent periods requires significant judgment and could change previous conclusions used to measure the tax position estimate. New information or events may include tax examinations or appeals (including information gained from those examinations), developments in case law, settlements of tax positions, changes in tax law and regulations, rulings by taxing authorities and statute of limitation expirations. Such information or events may have a significant impact on our financial position, results of operations and cash flows. 51 Accounting for Environmental Reserves: Environmental reserves are accrued when assessments indicate it is probable that a liability has been incurred and an amount can be reasonably estimated. Adjustments made to estimates of environmental liabilities could have a significant impact on earnings. We estimate these liabilities based on findings through various phases of the assessment, considering the most likely action plan from a variety of available remediation options (ranging from no action required to full site remediation and long-term monitoring), current site information from our site assessments, remediation estimates from third party engineering and remediation contractors, and our prior experience in remediating contaminated sites. Our estimates incorporate currently enacted state and federal environmental laws and regulations and data released by the EPA and other organizations. The estimates associated with each possible action plan are judgmental in nature partly because there are usually several different remediation options from which to choose. Our estimates are subject to revision in future periods based on actual costs or new information from other sources, including the level of contamination at the site, the extent of our responsibility or the extent of remediation required, recently enacted laws and regulations or a change in cost estimates due to certain economic factors. For further information, see Note 12A, "Commitments and Contingencies - Environmental Matters," to the consolidated financial statements. Fair Value Measurements: We follow fair value measurement guidance that defines fair value as the price that would be received for the sale of an asset or paid to transfer a liability in an orderly transaction between market participants at the measurement date (an exit price). We have applied this guidance to our Company's derivative contracts that are recorded at fair value, marketable securities held in NU supplemental benefit trust and WMECO spent nuclear fuel trust, the marketable securities held in CYAPC's and YAEC's nuclear decommissioning trusts, our valuations of investments in our pension and PBOP plans, and nonrecurring fair value measurements of nonfinancial assets such as goodwill and AROs. Changes in fair value of the regulated company derivative contracts are recorded as Regulatory Assets or Liabilities, as we expect to recover the costs of these contracts in rates. These valuations are sensitive to the prices of energy and energy-related products in future years for which markets have not yet developed and assumptions are made. We use quoted market prices when available to determine fair values of financial instruments. If quoted market prices are not available, fair value is determined using quoted prices for similar instruments in active markets, quoted prices for identical or similar instruments that are not active and model-derived valuations. When quoted prices in active markets for the same or similar instruments are not available, we value derivative contracts using models that incorporate both observable and unobservable inputs. Significant unobservable inputs utilized in the models include energy and energy-related product prices for future years for long-dated derivative contracts, future contract quantities under full requirements and supplemental sales contracts, and market volatilities. Discounted cash flow valuations incorporate estimates of premiums or discounts, reflecting risk adjusted profit that would be required by a market participant to arrive at an exit price, using available historical market transaction information. Valuations of derivative contracts also reflect our estimates of nonperformance risk, including credit risk. For further information on market risk, see Item 7A, "Quantitative and Qualitative Disclosures about Market Risk," included in this Annual Report on Form 10-K. For further information on derivative contracts and marketable securities, see Note 1I, "Summary of Significant Accounting Policies - Derivative Accounting," Note 5, "Derivative Instruments," and Note 6, "Marketable Securities," to the consolidated financial statements.

(b) Estimated interest payments on fixed-rate debt are calculated by multiplying the coupon rate on the debt by its scheduled notional amount outstanding for the period of measurement. Estimated interest payments on floating-rate debt are calculated by multiplying the average of the 2012 floating-rate resets on the debt by its scheduled notional amount outstanding for the period of measurement. This same rate is then assumed for the remaining life of the debt. (c) The capital lease obligations include imputed interest for NU and CL&P. (d) Amounts are not included on our consolidated balance sheets. (e) Other than the net mark-to-market changes on derivative contracts held by both the Regulated companies and NU Enterprises, these obligations are not included on our consolidated balance sheets. (f) Does not include unrecognized tax benefits for NU and CL&P as of December 31, 2012, as we cannot make reasonable estimates of the periods or the potential amounts of cash settlement with the respective taxing authorities. Also does not include an NU contingent commitment of approximately $40 million to an energy investment fund, which would be invested under certain conditions, as we cannot make reasonable estimates of the periods or the investment contributions. (g) Amount represents open purchase orders, excluding those obligations that are included in the capital leases, operating leases and estimated future annual long-term contractual costs. These payments are subject to change as certain purchase orders include estimates based on projected quantities of material and/or services that are provided on demand, the timing of which cannot be determined. Because payment timing cannot be determined, we include all open purchase order amounts in 2013. (h) These amounts represent NU's estimated minimum pension contributions to its qualified Pension Plan required under federal legislation. Contributions in 2014 through 2017 and thereafter will vary depending on many factors, including the performance of existing plan assets, valuation of the plan's liabilities and long-term discount rates, and are subject to change. (i) Excludes other long-term liabilities, including the unrecognized tax benefits described above, deferred contractual obligations, environmental reserves, employee medical insurance reserves ($17.4 million at NU and $11.3 million at CL&P), workers compensation and long-term disability insurance reserves ($50 million at NU and $19.9 million at CL&P) and the ARO liability reserves as we cannot make reasonable estimates of the timing of payments.

The year ended December 31, 2012 amounts include the operations of NSTAR from the date of the merger, April 10, 2012, through December 31, 2012: Comparison of 2012 to 2011 : Operating Revenues and Expenses For the Years Ended December 31, (Millions of Dollars) 2012 (a) 2011 Increase/ Percent (Decrease) Operating Revenues $ 6,273.8 $ 4,465.7 $ 1,808.1 40.5 % Operating Expenses: Purchased Power, Fuel and Transmission 2,084.4 1,657.9 426.5 25.7 Operations and Maintenance 1,583.1 1,095.4 487.7 44.5 Depreciation 519.0 302.2 216.8 71.7 Amortization of Regulatory Assets, Net 79.8 91.1 (11.3) (12.4) Amortization of Rate Reduction Bonds 142.0 69.9 72.1 (b) Energy Efficiency Programs 313.1 131.4 181.7 (b) Taxes Other Than Income Taxes 434.2 323.6 110.6 34.2 Total Operating Expenses 5,155.6 3,671.5 1,484.1 40.4 Operating Income $ 1,118.2 $ 794.2 $ 324.0 40.8 % (a) The 2012 results include the operations of NSTAR from the date of the merger, April 10, 2012, through December 31, 2012. (b) Percent greater than 100 percent not shown as it is not meaningful. Operating Revenues For the Years Ended December 31, (Millions of Dollars) 2012 (a) 2011 Increase Percent Electric Distribution $ 4,716.5 $ 3,343.1 $ 1,373.4 41.1 % Natural Gas Distribution 572.9 430.8 142.1 33.0 Total Distribution 5,289.4 3,773.9 1,515.5 40.2 Transmission 861.5 635.4 226.1 35.6 Total Regulated Companies 6,150.9 4,409.3 1,741.6 39.5 Other and Eliminations 122.9 56.4 66.5 (b) Total Operating Revenues $ 6,273.8 $ 4,465.7 $ 1,808.1 40.5 % (a) The 2012 results include the operations of NSTAR from the date of the merger, April 10, 2012, through December 31, 2012. (b) Percent greater than 100 percent not shown as it is not meaningful. A summary of our retail electric sales and firm natural gas sales were as follows: For the Years Ended December 31, 2012 (a) 2011 Increase Percent Retail Electric Sales in GWh 49,718 33,812 15,906 47.0 % Firm Natural Gas Sales in Million Cubic Feet 69,894 46,880 23,014 49.1 % (a) Includes the retail electric and firm natural gas sales of NSTAR from the date of the merger, April 10, 2012, through December 31, 2012. Our Operating Revenues increased in 2012, as compared to 2011, due primarily to the addition of NSTAR, which included electric distribution revenues of approximately $1.7 billion, transmission revenues of approximately $50 million, natural gas revenues of approximately $200 million and other revenues of approximately $15 million, and the consolidation of CYAPC and YAEC revenues of approximately $40 million. Excluding the impact of NSTAR's operations and the consolidation of CYAPC and YAEC, our Operating Revenues decreased due to the following: Lower electric distribution segment revenues related to the portions that are included in regulatory commission approved tracking mechanisms that recover certain incurred costs and do not impact earnings. The tracking mechanisms allow for rates to be changed periodically with overcollections refunded to customers or undercollections recovered from customers in future periods. The tracked electric distribution revenues decreased due primarily to lower energy and supply-related costs ($241.8 million), lower CL&P CTA revenues ($46.3 million), lower wholesale revenues ($44.4 million), lower retail transmission revenues ($17.8 million), partially offset by higher CL&P FMCC delivery-related revenues ($82.4 million), higher SCRC revenues at PSNH ($34.2 million) and higher CL&P retail SBC revenues ($22.5 million). 54 A decrease in natural gas segment revenues due primarily to a 4.3 percent decrease in Yankee Gas' sales volume related to the warmer than normal weather in the heating season of 2012, as compared to the heating season of 2011. In addition, there was a decrease in the cost of natural gas, which is fully recovered in revenues from sales to our customers. Partially offset by: Improved transmission segment revenues resulting from a higher level of investment in transmission infrastructure and the recovery of higher overall expenses, which are tracked and result in a related increase in revenues. The increase in expenses is directly related to the increase in transmission plant, primarily at WMECO, including costs associated with higher property taxes, depreciation and operation and maintenance expenses. An increase at PSNH related to the sale of oil to a third party ($20.8 million) in the second quarter of 2012, resulting in a benefit to customers through lower ES rates that does not impact earnings. The portion of electric distribution segment revenues that impacts earnings increased $8.8 million due primarily to CL&P regulatory incentives of $11.5 million and C&LM incentives of $6.2 million at CL&P, partially offset by a decrease in retail electric sales related to the warmer than normal winter weather in 2012, as compared to the winter of 2011. Purchased Power, Fuel and Transmission increased in 2012, as compared to 2011, due primarily to the following: 2012 Increase/(Decrease) (Millions of Dollars) Compared to 2011 The addition of NSTAR's operations $ 640.0 Lower GSC supply costs, partially offset by higher CfD costs at CL&P (124.3) Lower natural gas costs and lower sales at Yankee Gas (45.4) Lower purchased transmission costs and lower Basic Service costs at WMECO (25.4) Lower purchased power costs, partially offset by higher transmission costs at PSNH (8.6) Other and eliminations (9.8) $ 426.5 Operations and Maintenance increased in 2012, as compared to 2011, due primarily to the addition of NSTAR's operations, which included operating expenses of $320.8 million and maintenance expense of $50.4 million. Excluding the impact of NSTAR's operations, Operations and Maintenance increased due primarily to: Higher NU parent and other companies' expenses ($70.1 million) that were due primarily to the increase in costs related to the completion of NU merger with NSTAR ($55.9 million) and higher costs at NU unregulated contracting business related to an increased level of work in 2012 ($16.3 million). The establishment of a reserve related to major storm restoration costs ($40 million) at CL&P and bill credits to customers at CL&P and WMECO ($25 million and $3 million, respectively) as a result of the Connecticut and Massachusetts settlement agreements. In addition, there were higher electric distribution business expenses ($31.6 million) mainly as a result of general and administrative expenses primarily related to higher pension costs. Partially offsetting these increases was the absence in 2012 of the storm fund reserve established in 2011 to provide bill credits to residential customers as a result of the October 2011 snowstorm and to provide contributions to certain Connecticut charitable organizations ($30 million) at CL&P, a decrease in the amortization of the regulatory deferral allowed in the 2010 rate case decision ($21.4 million) at CL&P and lower maintenance costs at PSNH generation business due to less planned outage maintenance in 2012 ($17.8 million). Depreciation increased in 2012, as compared to 2011, due primarily to the addition of NSTAR's utility plant balances ($148.4 million) and an increase as a result of the consolidation of CYAPC and YAEC ($40.3 million). Excluding the impact of NSTAR and the consolidation of CYAPC and YAEC, Depreciation increased due primarily to higher utility plant balances resulting from completed construction projects placed into service. Amortization of Regulatory Assets, Net decreased in 2012, as compared to 2011, due primarily to a decrease in ES and TCAM amortization at PSNH ($46.9 million and $20.2 million, respectively), and higher CTA transition costs ($21.5 million) and lower CTA revenues ($46.3 million) at CL&P. Partially offsetting these decreases was an increase related to the addition of NSTAR's operations ($87.5 million), lower SBC costs ($7.6 million) and higher retail SBC revenues ($22.5 million) at CL&P, and an increase in SCRC amortization at PSNH ($13.5 million). Amortization of RRBs increased in 2012, as compared to 2011, due primarily to the addition of NSTAR Electric amortization ($67.7 million). 55 Energy Efficiency Programs increased in 2012, as compared to 2011, due primarily to the addition of NSTAR's operations ($169.4 million). In addition, there was an increase in expenses at WMECO attributable to an increase in spending in accordance with DPU approved energy efficiency programs. The increase in energy efficiency spending is recovered in rates and therefore does not impact earnings. Taxes Other Than Income Taxes increased in 2012, as compared to 2011, due primarily to the addition of NSTAR's operations ($96.4 million). In addition, there was an increase in property taxes as a result of an increase in Property, Plant and Equipment related to our regulated capital programs and an increase in the property tax rates. Interest Expense For the Years Ended December 31, Increase/ (Millions of Dollars) 2012 (a) 2011 (Decrease) Percent Interest on Long-Term Debt $ 316.9 $ 231.6 $ 85.3 36.8 % Interest on RRBs 6.2 8.6 (2.4) (27.9) Other Interest 6.8 10.2 (3.4) (33.3) $ 329.9 $ 250.4 $ 79.5 31.7 % (a) The 2012 results include the operations of NSTAR from the date of the merger, April 10, 2012, through December 31, 2012. Interest Expense increased in 2012, as compared to 2011, due primarily to the addition of NSTAR's operations ($70.6 million). The additional increase in Interest on Long-Term Debt was a result of the $260 million in new long-term debt issuances in September 2011 and higher short-term borrowings resulting in higher interest expense. Other Income, Net For the Years Ended December 31, (Millions of Dollars) 2012 (a) 2011 Decrease Percent Other Income, Net $ 19.7 $ 27.7 $ (8.0) (28.9) % (a) The 2012 results include the operations of NSTAR from the date of the merger, April 10, 2012, through December 31, 2012. Other Income, Net decreased in 2012, as compared to 2011, due primarily to lower AFUDC related to equity funds at PSNH as the Clean Air Project was placed into service in September 2011, partially offset by net gains on the NU supplemental benefit trust in 2012, compared to net losses in 2011. Income Tax Expense For the Years Ended December 31, (Millions of Dollars) 2012 (a) 2011 Increase Percent Income Tax Expense $ 274.9 $ 171.0 $ 103.9 60.8 % (a) The 2012 results include the operations of NSTAR from the date of the merger, April 10, 2012, through December 31, 2012. Income Tax Expense increased in 2012, as compared to 2011, due primarily to higher pre-tax earnings ($141.4 million), less favorable adjustments for prior year taxes ($21.3 million) and lower items that directly impact our tax return as a result of regulatory actions (flow-through items) ($3.4 million), partially offset by Connecticut and Massachusetts settlement agreement impacts ($41 million) and merger impacts ($19.9 million). 56 Comparison of 2011 to 2010 : Operating Revenues and Expenses For the Years Ended December 31, Increase/ (Millions of Dollars) 2011 2010 (Decrease) Percent Operating Revenues $ 4,465.7 $ 4,898.2 $ (432.5) (8.8) % Operating Expenses: Purchased Power, Fuel and Transmission 1,657.9 2,034.5 (376.6) (18.5) Operations and Maintenance 1,095.4 1,001.4 94.0 9.4 Depreciation 302.2 300.7 1.5 0.5 Amortization of Regulatory Assets, Net 91.1 90.1 1.0 1.1 Amortization of Rate Reduction Bonds 69.9 232.9 (163.0) (70.0) Energy Efficiency Programs 131.4 124.0 7.4 6.0 Taxes Other Than Income Taxes 323.6 314.7 8.9 2.8 Total Operating Expenses 3,671.5 4,098.3 (426.8) (10.4) Operating Income $ 794.2 $ 799.9 $ (5.7) (0.7) % Operating Revenues For the Years Ended December 31, Increase/ (Millions of Dollars) 2011 2010 (Decrease) Percent Electric Distribution $ 3,343.1 $ 3,802.0 $ (458.9) (12.1) % Natural Gas Distribution 430.8 434.3 (3.5) (0.8) Total Distribution 3,773.9 4,236.3 (462.4) (10.9) Transmission 635.4 625.6 9.8 1.6 Total Regulated Companies 4,409.3 4,861.9 (452.6) (9.3) Other and Eliminations 56.4 36.3 20.1 55.4 NU $ 4,465.7 $ 4,898.2 $ (432.5) (8.8) % A summary of our retail electric sales and firm natural gas sales were as follows: For the Years Ended December 31, Increase/ 2011 2010 (Decrease) Percent Retail Electric Sales in GWh 33,812 34,230 (418) (1.2) % Firm Natural Gas Sales in Million Cubic Feet (1) 46,880 43,406 3,474 8.0 % (1) The 2010 sales volumes for commercial customers have been adjusted to conform to current year presentation. Our Operating Revenues decreased in 2011, as compared to 2010, due primarily to: Lower electric distribution segment revenues related to the portions that are included in regulatory commission approved tracking mechanisms that recover certain incurred costs and do not impact earnings. The tracking mechanisms allow for rates to be changed periodically with overcollections refunded to customers or undercollections recovered from customers in future periods. The tracked electric distribution revenues decreased due primarily to lower energy and supply-related costs ($365.3 million), lower CTA revenues and stranded cost recoveries ($175.3 million), lower wholesale revenues ($85.2 million) and lower retail other revenues ($37.9 million), partially offset by higher CL&P FMCC delivery-related revenues ($28.6 million), higher retail transmission revenues ($12.2 million) and higher other tracked revenues ($28.7 million). Partially offset by: The portion of electric distribution segment revenues that impacts earnings increased $135.5 million due primarily to the rate case decisions that were effective during 2011. Improved transmission segment revenues resulting from a higher level of investment in transmission infrastructure and the recovery of higher overall expenses, which are tracked and result in a related increase in revenues. The increase in expenses is directly related to the increase in transmission plant, including costs associated with higher property taxes, depreciation and operation and maintenance expenses. These were partially offset by a refund to transmission wholesale customers, compared to a recovery from those customers in 2010. The transmission rates provide for an annual reconciliation and recovery or refund of projected costs to actual costs. The difference between projected costs and actual costs are recovered from, or refunded to, customers each year. 57 Purchased Power, Fuel and Transmission decreased in 2011, as compared to 2010, due primarily to the following: 2011 Increase/(Decrease) (Millions of Dollars) Compared to 2010 Lower GSC supply costs and purchased power costs, partially offset by higher CfD and other costs at CL&P $ (310.2) Lower energy prices, a slight increase in ES customer migration to third party suppliers and lower retail sales for PSNH's remaining ES customers (61.6) Lower Basic Service costs at WMECO (14.1) Lower natural gas costs at Yankee Gas (15.1) Other and eliminations 24.4 $ (376.6) Operations and Maintenance increased in 2011, as compared to 2010, due primarily to: Higher electric distribution expenses ($50.4 million) and higher natural gas expenses ($3.8 million), primarily related to CL&P establishment of a $30 million storm fund reserve to provide bill credits to its residential customers who remained without power after noon on Saturday, November 5, 2011, as a result of the October 2011 snowstorm and to provide contributions to certain Connecticut charitable organizations. There were also higher boiler equipment and maintenance costs at PSNH generation business related to the absence in 2011 of insurance proceeds received in 2010 related to turbine damage, which reduced 2010 costs ($7.4 million). In addition, there were higher pension costs and higher general and administrative expenses. Partially offsetting these increases were lower costs that are recovered through distribution tracking mechanisms that have no earnings impact ($17.7 million), such as uncollectible expenses and customer Energy Independence Act incentives. In addition, there were lower transmission segment expenses ($8.1 million). The partial amortization in 2011 of the allowed regulatory deferral, which was recorded in maintenance expense in 2010, as a result of the June 30, 2010 CL&P rate case decision ($54.9 million). Higher NU parent and other companies expenses ($27.3 million) due primarily to higher costs at NU unregulated electrical contracting business related to an increased level of work in 2011 ($19.6 million), partially offset by a decrease in costs related to NU's then pending merger with NSTAR ($2.1 million). Depreciation increased in 2011, as compared to 2010, due primarily to higher depreciation rates being used at PSNH and WMECO in 2011 as a result of distribution rate case decisions that were effective during 2011 and higher utility plant balances resulting from completed construction projects placed into service. Partially offsetting these increases was a lower depreciation rate being used at CL&P as a result of the distribution rate case decision that was effective July 1, 2010. Amortization of Regulatory Assets, Net increased in 2011, as compared to 2010, due primarily to lower CTA transition costs ($197.7 million) partially offset by lower retail CTA revenue ($154.6 million) at CL&P, the absence in 2011 of the impact from the 2010 Healthcare Act related to income taxes ($26 million) and increases in ES amortization ($11.4 million) and TCAM amortization ($5.9 million) at PSNH. Partially offsetting these increases was lower amortization related to the previously deferred unrecovered stranded generation costs at CL&P ($38.2 million) and lower amortization of the SBC balance at CL&P ($29.7 million). Amortization of Rate Reduction Bonds decreased in 2011, as compared to 2010, due to the maturity of CL&P RRBs in December 2010 and lower principal balances on the remaining PSNH and WMECO RRBs outstanding. Energy Efficiency Programs increased in 2011, as compared to 2010, due primarily to an increase in expenses attributable to an increase in spending in accordance with DPU approved energy efficiency programs at WMECO. Taxes Other Than Income Taxes increased in 2011, as compared to 2010, due primarily to an increase in property taxes as a result of an increase in Property, Plant and Equipment related to our capital program and an increase in the tax rate, offset by a decrease in the Connecticut Gross Earnings Tax due primarily to lower transmission segment revenues and lower CTA revenues in 2011, as compared to 2010. Interest Expense For the Years Ended December 31, Increase/ (Millions of Dollars) 2011 2010 (Decrease) Percent Interest on Long-Term Debt $ 231.6 $ 231.1 $ 0.5 0.2 % Interest on RRBs 8.6 20.6 (12.0) (58.3) Other Interest 10.2 (14.4) 24.6 (a) $ 250.4 $ 237.3 $ 13.1 5.5 % (a) Percent greater than 100 percent not shown since it is not meaningful. 58 Interest Expense increased in 2011, as compared to 2010, due primarily to higher Other Interest in 2011, as compared to 2010, due to the prior year inclusion of a tax-related benefit, partially offset by lower Interest on RRBs in 2011, as compared to 2010, resulting from the maturity of CL&P RRBs in December 2010 and lower principal balances on the remaining PSNH and WMECO RRBs outstanding. Other Income, Net For the Years Ended December 31, (Millions of Dollars) 2011 2010 Decrease Percent Other Income, Net $ 27.7 $ 41.9 $ (14.2) (33.9) % Other Income, Net decreased in 2011, as compared to 2010, due primarily to net losses on the NU supplemental benefit trust in 2011, compared to net gains in 2010, and the 2011 classification of C&LM and Energy Independence Act incentives; partially offset by higher AFUDC related to equity funds. Income Tax Expense For the Years Ended December 31, (Millions of Dollars) 2011 2010 Decrease Percent Income Tax Expense $ 171.0 $ 210.4 $ (39.4) (18.7) % Income Tax Expense decreased in 2011, as compared to 2010, due primarily to the absence in 2011 of the impact from the 2010 Healthcare Act ($25.2 million), adjustments for prior year's taxes including adjustments to reconcile estimated taxes accrued to actual amounts reflected in our filed tax returns (return to provision adjustments) ($16.3 million), lower flow-through items ($4.6 million) and lower pre-tax earnings ($2.1 million); partially offset by higher state income taxes ($9.6 million). 59 RESULTS OF OPERATIONS THE CONNECTICUT LIGHT AND POWER COMPANY AND SUBSIDIARY The following table provides the amounts and variances in operating revenues and expense line items for the consolidated statements of income for CL&P included in this Annual Report on Form 10-K for the years ended December 31, 2012, 2011, and 2010: Comparison of 2012 to 2011 : Operating Revenues and Expenses For the Years Ended December 31, (Millions of Dollars) 2012 2011 Increase/ Percent (Decrease) Operating Revenues $ 2,407.4 $ 2,548.4 $ (141.0) (5.5) % Operating Expenses: Purchased Power and Transmission 858.2 982.5 (124.3) (12.7) Operations and Maintenance 635.7 580.7 55.0 9.5 Depreciation 166.9 157.8 9.1 5.8 Amortization of Regulatory Assets, Net 14.4 61.0 (46.6) (76.4) Energy Efficiency Programs 89.3 90.3 (1.0) (1.1) Taxes Other Than Income Taxes 215.9 212.9 3.0 1.4 Total Operating Expenses 1,980.4 2,085.2 (104.8) (5.0) Operating Income $ 427.0 $ 463.2 $ (36.2) (7.8) % Operating Revenues CL&P's retail sales were as follows: For the Years Ended December 31, 2012 2011 Decrease Percent Retail Sales in GWh 22,109 22,315 (206) (0.9) % CL&P's Operating Revenues decreased in 2012, as compared to 2011, due primarily to: A $133.6 million decrease in distribution revenues related to the portions that are included in PURA approved tracking mechanisms that recover certain incurred costs and do not impact earnings. The tracking mechanisms allow for rates to be changed periodically with overcollections refunded to customers or undercollections recovered from customers in future periods. The tracked distribution revenues decreased due primarily to lower GSC and FMCC supply-related revenues ($150.8 million), lower CTA revenues ($46.3 million), lower wholesale revenues ($33.5 million), and lower retail transmission revenues ($4.3 million). The lower GSC and FMCC supply-related revenues were due primarily to lower customer rates resulting from lower average supply prices and lower sales related to additional customer migration to third party electric suppliers in 2012. Partially offsetting these decreases were higher FMCC delivery-related revenues ($82.4 million) and higher retail SBC revenues ($22.5 million). Partially offset by: A $7.6 million increase in the portion of distribution revenues that impacts earnings in 2012, compared to 2011, due primarily to regulatory incentives of $11.5 million and C&LM incentives of $6.2 million, partially offset by lower sales volume related to warmer than normal winter weather in 2012, as compared to the winter of 2011. A $7.2 million increase in transmission revenues resulting from an increased level of investment in transmission infrastructure and the recovery of higher overall expenses, which are subject to tracking mechanisms or processes (tracked) and result in a related increase in revenues. The increase in expenses is directly related to the increase in transmission plant, including costs associated with higher property taxes, depreciation and operation and maintenance expenses. Purchased Power and Transmission decreased in 2012, as compared to 2011, due primarily to the following: 2012 Increase/(Decrease) (Millions of Dollars) Compared to 2011 GSC Supply Costs $ (112.0) Deferred Fuel Costs (33.4) Transmission Costs (26.8) Purchased Power Contracts (19.4) CfD Costs 70.7 Other (3.4) $ (124.3) The decrease in GSC supply costs was due to lower average supply prices and lower sales. The lower sales were due primarily to additional customer migration to third party electric suppliers. These GSC supply costs are the contractual amounts CL&P must pay to 60 various suppliers that have been awarded the right to supply SS and LRS load through a competitive solicitation process. These costs are included in PURA approved tracking mechanisms and do not impact earnings. Operations and Maintenance increased in 2012, as compared to 2011, due primarily to the establishment of a reserve related to major storm restoration costs ($40 million) and a bill credit to customers ($25 million) in the second quarter of 2012 as a result of the Connecticut settlement agreement . In addition, there were higher distribution business expenses as a result of higher general and administrative expenses primarily related to an increase in pension costs ($20.2 million) and higher routine distribution maintenance ($19.4 million). There were also higher distribution costs related to customer Energy Independence Act incentives, which are tracked and fully recoverable through tracking mechanisms ($6.5 million). Partially offsetting these increases was the absence in 2012 of the storm fund reserve established in 2011 to provide bill credits to residential customers as a result of the October 2011 snowstorm ($30 million) and a decrease in the amortization of the regulatory deferral allowed in the 2010 rate case decision ($21.4 million). Depreciation increased in 2012, as compared to 2011, due primarily to higher utility plant balances resulting from completed construction projects placed into service related to CL&P capital programs. Amortization of Regulatory Assets, Net decreased in 2012, as compared to 2011, due primarily to higher CTA transition costs ($21.5 million) and lower CTA revenues ($46.3 million). Partially offsetting these impacts were lower SBC costs ($7.6 million) and higher retail SBC revenues ($22.5 million). Interest Expense For the Years Ended December 31, Increase/ (Millions of Dollars) 2012 2011 (Decrease) Percent Interest on Long-Term Debt $ 124.9 $ 131.9 $ (7.0) (5.3) % Other Interest 8.2 0.8 7.4 (a) $ 133.1 $ 132.7 $ 0.4 0.3 % (a) Percent greater than 100 percent not shown since it is not meaningful. Interest on Long-Term Debt decreased in 2012, as compared to 2011, due primarily to the refinancing of the PCRBs at a lower interest rate in October 2011. Other Interest increased in 2012, as compared to 2011, due primarily to the absence of tax-related benefits recognized in 2011 and an increase in short-term borrowings resulting in higher interest expense. Income Tax Expense For the Years Ended December 31, (Millions of Dollars) 2012 2011 Increase Percent Income Tax Expense $ 94.4 $ 90.0 $ 4.4 4.9 % Income Tax Expense increased in 2012, as compared to 2011, due primarily to less favorable adjustments for prior year taxes ($22.4 million), an increase to pre-tax earnings ($13.8 million), partially offset by Connecticut settlement agreement impacts ($26.6 million), and lower state tax and other impacts ($5.2 million). 61 Comparison of 2011 to 2010 : Operating Revenues and Expenses For the Years Ended December 31, (Millions of Dollars) 2011 2010 Increase/ (Decrease) Percent Operating Revenues $ 2,548.4 $ 2,999.1 $ (450.7) (15.0) % Operating Expenses: Purchased Power and Transmission 982.5 1,292.7 (310.2) (24.0) Operations and Maintenance 580.7 494.2 86.5 17.5 Depreciation 157.8 172.1 (14.3) (8.4) Amortization of Regulatory Assets, Net 61.0 78.9 (17.9) (22.7) Amortization of Rate Reduction Bonds - 167.0 (167.0) (100.0) Energy Efficiency Programs 90.3 92.3 (2.0) (2.2) Taxes Other Than Income Taxes 212.9 214.2 (1.3) (0.6) Total Operating Expenses 2,085.2 2,511.4 (426.2) (17.0) Operating Income $ 463.2 $ 487.7 $ (24.5) (5.0) % Operating Revenues CL&P's retail sales were as follows: For the Years Ended December 31, 2011 2010 Decrease Percent Retail Sales in GWh 22,315 22,666 (351) (1.5) % CL&P's Operating Revenues decreased in 2011, as compared to 2010, due primarily to: A $545.4 million decrease in distribution revenues related to the portions that are included in PURA approved tracking mechanisms that recover certain incurred costs and do not impact earnings. The tracked distribution revenues decreased due primarily to lower GSC and FMCC supply-related revenues ($316.4 million), lower CTA revenues ($165.5 million), lower wholesale revenues ($81.7 million) and lower retail other revenues ($38.4 million). The lower GSC and FMCC supply-related revenues were due primarily to lower customer rates resulting from lower average supply prices and additional customer migration to third party electric suppliers in 2011, as compared to 2010. These lower revenues were partially offset by higher FMCC delivery-related revenues ($28.6 million) and higher retail transmission revenues ($14 million). The tracking mechanisms allow for rates to be changed periodically with overcollections refunded to customers or undercollections recovered from customers in future periods. A $15.7 million decrease in transmission segment revenues was due primarily to a refund to transmission wholesale customers, compared to a recovery from those customers in 2010. The transmission rates provide for an annual reconciliation and recovery or refund of projected costs to actual costs. The difference between projected costs and actual costs are recovered from, or refunded to, customers each year. This decrease was partially offset by increased transmission segment revenues due to a higher level of investment in the transmission infrastructure. Partially offset by: The portion of distribution revenues that impacts earnings increased $110.4 million in 2011, as compared to 2010, due primarily to the retail rate increase effective January 1, 2011. Purchased Power and Transmission decreased in 2011, as compared to 2010, due primarily to the following: 2011 Increase/(Decrease) (Millions of Dollars) Compared to 2010 GSC Supply Costs $ (325.8) Purchased Power Costs (60.4) CfD Costs 54.9 Transmission Costs 13.2 Deferred Fuel Costs 10.5 Other (2.6) $ (310.2) The decrease in GSC supply costs was due primarily to lower average supply prices and additional customer migration to third party electric suppliers in 2011, as compared to 2010. These GSC supply costs are the contractual amounts CL&P must pay to various suppliers that have been awarded the right to supply SS and LRS load through a competitive solicitation process. These costs are included in PURA approved tracking mechanisms and do not impact earnings. Operations and Maintenance increased in 2011, as compared to 2010, as a result of higher distribution expenses ($60.4 million). Included in these costs was the establishment of a $30 million storm fund reserve to provide bill credits to its residential customers who 62 remained without power after noon on Saturday, November 5, 2011, as a result of the October 2011 snowstorm and to provide contributions to certain Connecticut charitable organizations, higher general and administrative expenses, including higher pension costs. In addition, there was an increase related to the partial amortization in 2011 of the allowed regulatory deferral, which was recorded in maintenance expense in 2010, as a result of the June 30, 2010 rate case decision ($54.9 million). Partially offsetting these increases were lower costs that are recovered through distribution tracking mechanisms and have no earnings impact ($16.4 million) and lower transmission segment expenses ($7.4 million). Depreciation decreased in 2011, as compared to 2010, due primarily to a lower depreciation rate being used as a result of the 2010 distribution rate case decision that was effective July 1, 2010, partially offset by higher utility plant balances resulting from completed construction projects placed into service. Amortization of Regulatory Assets, Net decreased in 2011, as compared to 2010, due primarily to lower amortization related to the previously deferred unrecovered stranded generation costs ($38.2 million) and lower amortization of the SBC balance ($29.7 million). Partially offsetting these decreases were lower CTA transition costs ($197.7 million), partially offset by lower retail CTA revenue ($154.6 million), and the absence in 2011 of the impact from the 2010 Healthcare Act related to income taxes ($12 million). Amortization of Rate Reductions Bonds decreased in 2011, as compared to 2010, due to the maturity of RRBs in December 2010. Taxes Other Than Income Taxes decreased in 2011, as compared to 2010, due primarily to a decrease in the Connecticut Gross Earnings Tax due primarily to lower transmission segment revenues and lower CTA revenues in 2011, as compared to 2010, partially offset by an increase in property taxes as a result of an increase in Property, Plant and Equipment related to CL&P capital program and an increase in the tax rate. Interest Expense For the Years Ended December 31, (Millions of Dollars) 2011 2010 Increase/ (Decrease) Percent Interest on Long-Term Debt $ 131.9 $ 134.6 $ (2.7) (2.0) % Interest on RRBs - 7.5 (7.5) (100.0) Other Interest 0.8 (4.4) 5.2 (a) $ 132.7 $ 137.7 $ (5.0) (3.6) % (a) Percent greater than 100 percent not shown since it is not meaningful Interest Expense decreased in 2011, as compared to 2010, due primarily to the absence of Interest on RRBs in 2011, as CL&P's RRBs matured in December 2010, and lower Interest on Long-Term Debt in 2011 related to lower interest rates on the refinancing of the PCRBs. Partially offsetting these decreases was higher Other Interest in 2011, as compared to 2010, due to the prior year inclusion of a tax-related benefit. Other Income, Net For the Years Ended December 31, (Millions of Dollars) 2011 2010 Decrease Percent Other Income, Net $ 9.7 $ 26.7 $ (17.0) (63.7) % Other Income, Net decreased in 2011, as compared to 2010, due primarily to net losses on the NU supplemental benefit trust in 2011, compared to net gains in 2010, as well as the 2011 classification of C&LM and Energy Independence Act incentives. Income Tax Expense For the Years Ended December 31, (Millions of Dollars) 2011 2010 Decrease Percent Income Tax Expense $ 90.0 $ 132.4 $ (42.4) (32.0) % Income Tax Expense decreased in 2011, as compared to 2010, due primarily to the absence in 2011 of the impact from the 2010 Healthcare Act ($13.2 million), adjustments for prior year taxes including return to provision ($16.7 million), a decrease in pre-tax earnings ($7.3 million) and lower flow-through and other impacts ($5.2 million). LIQUIDITY CL&P had cash flows provided by operating activities of $211.9 million in 2012, compared with cash flows provided by operating activities of $513.3 million in 2011. The reduced cash flows were due primarily to $223.1 million of cash disbursements for storm restoration costs primarily associated with Tropical Storm Irene, the October 2011 snowstorm, and Hurricane Sandy made in 2012, as compared to approximately $132 million in 2011, $27 million in bill credits provided to residential customers in February 2012 related to the October 2011 snowstorm, $25 million in bill credits to customers associated with the Connecticut settlement agreement and changes in traditional working capital amounts principally due to the changes in the timing of payments of accounts payable and accrued liabilities. In addition, CL&P had lower recovery of its deferred operation and maintenance costs of $23.1 million in 2012, as 63 compared to 2011, a negative cash flow impact of $38.9 million resulting from changes in reserves for transmission refunds in 2012, as compared to 2011, and a decrease in income tax refunds of $14.6 million in 2012, as compared to 2011. CL&P had cash flows provided by operating activities in 2011 of $513.3 million, compared with operating cash flows of $501.7 million in 2010 (2010 amount is net of RRB payments, which is included in financing activities). The improved cash flows in 2011 were due primarily to the impact of the PURA July 1, 2010 distribution rate case decision, which increased CL&P customer rates effective January 1, 2011, and income tax receipts in 2011 of $27.5 million largely attributable to accelerated depreciation tax benefits, compared to income tax payments of $71.5 million in 2010. Offsetting these benefits was approximately $132 million of cash disbursements for storm restoration costs associated with Tropical Storm Irene and the October 2011 snowstorm. Cash capital expenditures included on the accompanying consolidated statements of cash flows do not include amounts incurred on capital projects but not yet paid, cost of removal, the AFUDC related to equity funds, and the capitalized portions of pension and PBOP expense or income. CL&P's cash capital expenditures totaled $449.1 million in 2012, compared with $424.9 million in 2011. On March 22, 2012, the FERC approved CL&P's application requesting to increase its total short-term borrowing capacity from a maximum of $450 million to a maximum of $600 million through December 31, 2013. On March 26, 2012, CL&P entered into a five-year $300 million unsecured revolving credit facility. The credit facility is intended to finance short-term borrowings that CL&P incurred to fund costs of restoring power following Tropical Storm Irene and the October 2011 snowstorm. Under this new facility, CL&P can borrow either on a short-term or a long-term basis subject to any necessary regulatory approval, and may borrow at prime rates or LIBOR-based rates, plus an applicable margin based on the higher of S&P or Moody credit ratings. As of December 31, 2012, CL&P had $89 million in borrowings outstanding under this credit facility. The weighted-average interest rate on these borrowings as of December 31, 2012 was 3.325 percent. On April 2, 2012, CL&P remarketed $62 million of tax-exempt PCRBs that were subject to mandatory tender on that date. The PCRBs, which mature on May 1, 2031, carry a coupon rate of 1.55 percent during the current three-year fixed-rate period, and are subject to mandatory tender for purchase on April 1, 2015. On July 25, 2012, NU, CL&P, NSTAR LLC, NSTAR Gas, PSNH, WMECO, and Yankee Gas jointly entered into a five-year $1.15 billion revolving credit facility. The new facility replaced (1) the NSTAR LLC revolving credit facility of $175 million that served to backstop a commercial paper program utilized by NSTAR LLC and was scheduled to expire on December 31, 2012, (2) the NSTAR Gas revolving credit facility of $75 million that expired on June 8, 2012, and (3) the CL&P, PSNH, WMECO, and Yankee Gas joint $400 million and NU parent $500 million unsecured revolving credit facilities that were scheduled to expire on September 24, 2013. The new facility expires on July 25, 2017. As of December 31, 2012, CL&P had $405.1 million in intercompany short-term borrowings under the NU commercial paper program. The weighted average interest rate on these borrowings as of December 31, 2012 was 0.46 percent. On October 1, 2012, CL&P redeemed at par four different series of tax-exempt PCRBs totaling $116.4 million. The PCRBs carried coupons that ranged from 5.85 percent to 5.95 percent and maturities that ranged from 2016 through 2028. On January 15, 2013, CL&P issued $400 million of 2.5 percent first mortgage bonds that will mature on January 15, 2023. The proceeds, net of issuance costs, were used to repay CL&P revolving credit facility borrowings of $89 million and $305.8 million of its commercial paper program borrowings. Financing activities in 2012 included $100.5 million in common stock dividends paid to NU parent, an increase in intercompany short-term borrowings of $346.6 million, and an increase in short-term notes payable of $58 million. CL&P uses available capital resources to fund its construction expenditures, meet debt requirements, pay costs, including storm-related costs, pay dividends and fund its other obligations. The current growth in CL&P transmission construction expenditures utilizes a significant amount of cash for projects that have a long-term return on investment and recovery period. In addition, CL&P operates in an environment where recovery of its distribution construction expenditures takes place over an extended period of time. As well, the future recovery of its deferred storm-related costs, which must be approved by the PURA, will take place over a six-year period for those costs deferred as a result of 2011 activity (as covered by the Connecticut Settlement Agreement) and over an extended period of time for those storm restoration costs incurred related to Hurricane Sandy. This impacts the timing of the revenue stream designed to fully recover the total investment plus a return on the equity portion of the cost and related financing costs. These factors have resulted in CL&P current liabilities exceeding current assets by approximately $268 million as of December 31, 2012. As of December 31, 2012, $125 million of CL&P's current liabilities relates to long-term debt that will be paid in the next 12 months. CL&P, with its strong credit ratings, has several options available in the financial markets to repay or refinance these maturities with the issuance of new long-term debt. CL&P will reduce its short-term borrowings with cash received from operating cash flows or with the issuance of new long-term debt, as deemed appropriate given our capital requirements and maintenance of our credit rating and profile. Management expects the future operating cash flows of CL&P, along with the access to financial markets, will be sufficient to meet any future operating requirements and capital investment forecasted opportunities. 64 RESULTS OF OPERATIONS NSTAR ELECTRIC COMPANY AND SUBSIDIARIES The following table provides the amounts and variances in operating revenues and expense line items for the consolidated statements of income for NSTAR Electric included in this Annual Report on Form 10-K for the years ended December 31, 2012, 2011, and 2010: Operating Revenues and Expenses For the Years Ended December 31, (Millions of Dollars) 2012 2011 Increase/ Percent (Decrease) Operating Revenues $ 2,301.0 $ 2,403.1 $ (102.1) (4.2) % Operating Expenses: Purchased Power and Transmission 788.3 905.2 (116.9) (12.9) Operations and Maintenance 431.8 387.5 44.3 11.4 Depreciation 171.1 163.4 7.7 4.7 Amortization of Regulatory Assets, Net 117.7 83.0 34.7 41.8 Amortization of Rate Reduction Bonds 90.3 90.3 - - Energy Efficiency Programs 201.2 175.7 25.5 14.5 Taxes Other Than Income Taxes 119.2 111.8 7.4 6.6 Total Operating Expenses 1,919.6 1,916.9 2.7 0.1 Operating Income $ 381.4 $ 486.2 $ (104.8) (21.6) % Operating Revenues NSTAR Electric's retail sales were as follows: For the Years Ended December 31, 2012 2011 Decrease Percent Retail Sales in GWh 21,209 21,502 (293) (1.4) % NSTAR Electric's Operating Revenues decreased in 2012, as compared to 2011, due primarily to: A $104.7 million decrease in distribution revenues related to the portions that are included in DPU approved tracking mechanisms that recover certain incurred costs and do not impact earnings. The tracking mechanisms allow for rates to be changed periodically with overcollections refunded to customers or undercollections recovered from customers in future periods. This decrease primarily related to lower purchased power and transmission costs ($34.2 million), lower retail transmission revenues ($19.8 million), lower PAM revenues ($19.1 million), lower transition revenues ($14.7 million), partially offset by an increase in energy efficiency program revenues ($8.3 million). Partially offset by: A $2.8 million increase in transmission revenues resulting from an increased level of investment in transmission infrastructure and the recovery of higher overall expenses, which are tracked and result in a related increase in revenues. The increase in expenses is directly related to the increase in transmission plant, including costs associated with higher property taxes, depreciation and operation and maintenance expenses. Purchased Power and Transmission decreased in 2012, as compared to 2011, due primarily to the following: 2012 Increase/(Decrease) (Millions of Dollars) Compared to 2011 Basic Service Costs $ (53.8) Purchased Power Contracts (45.5) Transmission Costs (29.6) Deferred Fuel Costs 15.7 Other (3.7) $ (116.9) The decrease in Basic Service costs was due primarily to lower average supply prices and additional customer migration to third party electric suppliers and the decrease in purchased power contracts was due primarily to the expiration of certain contracts. The decrease in transmission costs was due primarily to a lower transmission cost deferral that will be recovered in future periods. The increase in deferred fuel costs was due primarily to lower average supply prices, as compared to the prices projected when Basic Service rates were set. These costs are included in DPU approved tracking mechanisms and do not impact earnings. 65 Operations and Maintenance increased in 2012, as compared to 2011, due primarily to the cumulative adjustment recorded to establish a reserve against the regulatory asset related to Basic Service bad debt costs ($28 million). In addition, first quarter 2012 adjustments were recognized for changes in accounting estimates related primarily to the allowance for doubtful accounts, workers compensation, employee medical benefits, and general liability claims ($18.7 million). In addition, a bill credit to customers ($15 million) was recorded in the second quarter of 2012 as a result of the Massachusetts settlement agreement. Also contributing to the increase in costs was an incident in March 2012 involving a substation fire in the Back Bay/Prudential area of Boston ($11.8 million). These increases were partially offset by lower PAM-related amortizations ($23.1 million). Amortization of Regulatory Assets, Net , increased in 2012, as compared to 2011, due primarily to higher amortization related to transition costs. Energy Efficiency Programs increased in 2012, as compared to 2011, due primarily to the establishment of a reserve to reflect a billing adjustment made in the fourth quarter of 2012, and an increase in energy efficiency costs in accordance with the three-year program guidelines established by the DPU. All costs are fully recovered through DPU tracking mechanisms and therefore do not impact earnings. Interest Expense For the Years Ended December 31, Increase/ (Millions of Dollars) 2012 2011 (Decrease) Percent Interest on Long-Term Debt $ 87.1 $ 90.0 $ (2.9) (3.2) % Interest on RRBs 3.6 7.2 (3.6) (50.0) Other Interest (20.6) (27.8) 7.2 25.9 $ 70.1 $ 69.4 $ 0.7 1.0 % Other Interest expense increased in 2012, as compared to 2011, due primarily to a reduction in regulatory interest income primarily from deferred transition costs ($5.9 million) and reduced interest income from legal matters ($3.2 million), partially offset by a decrease in the interest expense related to tax issues ($2 million) due to the receipt of a 2001 through 2007 tax settlement in June 2011. Income Tax Expense For the Years Ended December 31, (Millions of Dollars) 2012 2011 Decrease Percent Income Tax Expense $ 124.0 $ 165.7 $ (41.7) (25.2) % Income Tax Expense decreased in 2012, as compared to 2011, due primarily to lower pre-tax earnings ($33.6 million), Massachusetts settlement agreement impacts ($5.9 million) and merger impacts ($1.2 million). EARNINGS SUMMARY For the Years Ended December 31, (Millions of Dollars) 2012 2011 2010 Income Before Merger Settlement Agreement Costs $ 201.1 $ 252.5 $ 248.6 Merger Settlement Agreement Costs (after-tax) (10.9) - - Net Income $ 190.2 $ 252.5 $ 248.6 The after-tax merger settlement agreement costs in 2012 consisted of approximately $17.9 million (pre-tax) of charges for customer bill credits related to the Massachusetts settlement agreement, transaction and integration-related costs, and compensation costs. Excluding the merger settlement agreement costs, NSTAR Electric 2012 earnings were $51.4 million lower than 2011 due primarily to the first quarter 2012 adjustments recorded to establish a reserve against the regulatory asset related to Basic Service bad debt costs ($17 million), and for changes in accounting estimates related primarily to the allowance for doubtful accounts, workers compensation, employee medical benefits, and general liability claims ($11.4 million). Also contributing to the increase in costs was an incident in March 2012 involving a substation fire in the Back Bay/Prudential area of Boston ($7.2 million), a reserve recorded relating to lost base revenues based on developments during hearings in the merger proceeding ($3 million) and higher depreciation and property taxes ($17.3 million). These factors are partially offset by higher transmission revenues due to an increased level of investment in transmission infrastructure ($6.2 million). 66 NSTAR Electric 2011 earnings were $252.5 million, compared to $248.6 million in 2010. Major factors on an after-tax basis that contributed to the $3.9 million, increase include: higher transmission revenues ($10.9 million); higher lost base revenues and performance incentives related to the impacts of the Energy Efficiency Programs ($7 million); and the absence in 2011 of the cumulative impact of a true-up adjustment resulting from a DPU order in May 2010 related to NSTAR Electric transition revenue for the years 2006 through 2009 ($3 million). These increases were partially offset by: lower distribution revenues (0.7 percent decrease in sales) due to cooler summer weather in 2011, as compared to the summer of 2010, and the impact of energy conservation programs ($5.4 million); higher depreciation and property taxes ($7.3 million); and higher operations and maintenance expenses ($8.8 million). CAPITAL EXPENDITURES A summary of capital expenditures, including amounts incurred but not paid, cost of removal, AFUDC, and the capitalized portions of pension and PBOP expense or income, is as follows: For the Years Ended December 31, (Millions of Dollars) 2012 2011 2010 Transmission $ 192.1 $ 162.5 $ 87.2 Distribution: Basic Business 64.2 58.5 54.7 Aging Infrastructure 145.8 132.8 124.2 Load Growth 21.2 19.3 18.0 Total Distribution 231.2 210.6 196.9 Total $ 423.3 $ 373.1 $ 284.1 LIQUIDITY NSTAR Electric had cash flows provided by operating activities of $506.9 million in 2012 and $662 million in 2011 (amounts are net of RRB payments, which are included in financing activities). The decreased cash flows in 2012 were due primarily to the absence in 2012 of income tax refunds received during 2011. In 2012, NSTAR Electric made income tax payments of $88.1 million, as compared to income tax refunds of $62.2 million in 2011. In addition, NSTAR Electric provided $15 million in bill credits to its customers associated with the Massachusetts settlement agreement in 2012, and had regulatory undercollections of retail transmission revenues of $53 million in 2012, as compared to 2011. Partially offsetting these negative cash flow impacts was a reduction in Pension Plan contributions of $100 million in 2012, as compared to 2011. 67 RESULTS OF OPERATIONS PUBLIC SERVICE COMPANY OF NEW HAMPSHIRE AND SUBSIDIARIES The following table provides the amounts and variances in operating revenues and expense line items for the consolidated statements of income for PSNH included in this Annual Report on Form 10-K for the years ended December 31, 2012 and 2011: Operating Revenues and Expenses For the Years Ended December 31, (Millions of Dollars) 2012 2011 Increase/ Percent (Decrease) Operating Revenues $ 988.0 $ 1,013.0 $ (25.0) (2.5) % Operating Expenses: Purchased Power, Fuel and Transmission 319.3 327.9 (8.6) (2.6) Operations and Maintenance 263.2 278.2 (15.0) (5.4) Depreciation 87.6 76.1 11.5 15.1 Amortization of Regulatory Assets/(Liabilities), Net (24.1) 25.4 (49.5) (a) Amortization of Rate Reduction Bonds 56.6 53.4 3.2 6.0 Energy Efficiency Programs 14.2 12.9 1.3 10.1 Taxes Other Than Income Taxes 66.1 59.0 7.1 12.0 Total Operating Expenses 782.9 832.9 (50.0) (6.0) Operating Income $ 205.1 $ 180.1 $ 25.0 13.9 % (a) Percent greater than 100 percent not shown as it is not meaningful. Operating Revenues PSNH's retail sales were as follows: For the Years Ended December 31, 2012 2011 Increase Percent Retail Sales in GWh 7,821 7,815 6 0.1 % PSNH's Operating Revenues decreased in 2012, as compared to 2011, due primarily to: A $52.7 million decrease in distribution revenues related to the portions that are included in NHPUC approved tracking mechanisms that recover certain incurred costs and do not impact earnings. The tracking mechanisms allow for rates to be changed periodically with overcollections refunded to customers or undercollections recovered from customers in future periods. This decrease related primarily to lower purchased power and fuel costs ($88.3 million) , lower wholesale revenues ($7.3 million) and lower retail transmission revenues ($5.8 million). These lower revenues were partially offset by higher SCRC revenues ($34.2 million) and RECs ($9.5 million). Partially offset by: An increase related to the sale of oil to a third party ($20.8 million) in the second quarter of 2012, resulting in a benefit to customers through lower ES rates that does not impact earnings. A $9.9 million increase in transmission revenues resulting from an increased level of investment in transmission infrastructure and the recovery of higher overall expenses, which are tracked and result in a related increase in revenues. The increase in expenses is directly related to the increase in transmission plant, including costs associated with higher property taxes, depreciation and operation and maintenance expenses. A $3.5 million increase in the portion of distribution revenues that impacts earnings in 2012, as compared to 2011, due primarily to the favorable impact of the 2010 rate case decision related to the additional increase to annualized rates that was effective July 1, 2012. Purchased Power, Fuel and Transmission decreased in 2012, as compared to 2011, due primarily to a decrease in purchased power costs, partially offset by an increase in transmission costs. The decrease in purchased power costs was due primarily to lower market prices in 2012, as compared to 2011, as well as an increase in ES customer migration to third party suppliers. Operations and Maintenance decreased in 2012, as compared to 2011, as a result of lower maintenance costs at the generation business due to less planned outage maintenance in 2012 ($17.8 million), partially offset by higher distribution general and administrative costs ($3 million). Depreciation increased in 2012, as compared to 2011, due primarily to higher utility plant balances resulting from completed construction projects placed into service related to PSNH's capital programs. Amortization of Regulatory Assets/(Liabilities), Net decreased in 2012, as compared to 2011, due primarily to a decrease in ES and TCAM amortization ($46.9 million and $20.2 million, respectively), partially offset by an increase in SCRC amortization ($13.5 million). 68 Taxes Other Than Income Taxes increased in 2012, as compared to 2011, due primarily to an increase in property taxes as a result of an increase in Property, Plant and Equipment related to PSNH capital program and an increase in the property tax rates. Interest Expense For the Years Ended December 31, Increase/ (Millions of Dollars) 2012 2011 (Decrease) Percent Interest on Long-Term Debt $ 46.2 $ 36.8 $ 9.4 25.5 % Interest on RRBs 2.7 6.3 (3.6) (57.1) Other Interest 1.3 1.0 0.3 30.0 $ 50.2 $ 44.1 $ 6.1 13.8 % Interest Expense increased in 2012, as compared to 2011, due primarily to an increase in Interest on Long-Term Debt, which was primarily the result of a reduction in AFUDC related to borrowed funds as the Clean Air Project was placed into service in September 2011 ($5.5 million). The additional increase in Interest on Long-Term Debt was a result of the $160 million long-term debt issuance in September 2011.

Income Tax Expense For the Years Ended December 31, (Millions of Dollars) 2012 2011 Increase Percent Income Tax Expense $ 61.0 $ 49.9 $ 11.1 22.2 % Income Tax Expense increased in 2012, as compared to 2011, due primarily to lower flow-through items ($4.1 million), higher state taxes ($3.8 million), an increase in pre-tax earnings ($2.7 million) and return to provision ($0.8 million). LIQUIDITY PSNH had cash flows provided by operating activities in 2012 of $174.2 million, compared with operating cash flows of $151.8 million in 2011 (amounts are net of RRB payments, which are included in financing activities). The improved cash flows in 2012 were due primarily to a reduction in NU Pension Plan contributions of $24.9 million in 2012, as compared to 2011, the absence in 2012 of a cash flow hedge settlement creating a favorable cash flow impact of $18.1 million, and an increased reduction in coal and fuel inventories in 2012. The reduction in fuel inventories in 2012 is primarily attributable to the sale of oil to a third party for $20.8 million. Offsetting these positive cash flow impacts were income tax payments in 2012 of $14.7 million, as compared to income tax refunds in 2011 of $29.3 million. 69 RESULTS OF OPERATIONS WESTERN MASSACHUSETTS ELECTRIC COMPANY AND SUBSIDIARY The following table provides the amounts and variances in operating revenues and expense line items for the consolidated statements of income for WMECO included in this Annual Report on Form 10-K for the years ended December 31, 2012 and 2011: Operating Revenues and Expenses For the Years Ended December 31, (Millions of Dollars) 2012 2011 Increase/ Percent (Decrease) Operating Revenues $ 441.2 $ 417.3 $ 23.9 5.7 % Operating Expenses: Purchased Power and Transmission 136.1 161.5 (25.4) (15.7) Operations and Maintenance 97.0 80.2 16.8 20.9 Depreciation 30.0 26.5 3.5 13.2 Amortization of Regulatory Assets, Net 0.4 4.5 (4.1) (91.1) Amortization of Rate Reduction Bonds 17.6 16.5 1.1 6.7 Energy Efficiency Programs 27.8 21.8 6.0 27.5 Taxes Other Than Income Taxes 21.5 17.9 3.6 20.1 Total Operating Expenses 330.4 328.9 1.5 0.5 Operating Income $ 110.8 $ 88.4 $ 22.4 25.3 % Operating Revenues WMECO's retail sales were as follows: For the Years Ended December 31, 2012 2011 Decrease Percent Retail Sales in GWh 3,683 3,695 (12) (0.3) % WMECO's Operating Revenues increased in 2012, as compared to 2011, due primarily to: A $32.3 million increase in transmission revenues resulting from an increased level of investment in transmission infrastructure, primarily related to the NEEWS projects, and the recovery of higher overall expenses, which are tracked and result in a related increase in revenues. The increase in expenses is directly related to the increase in transmission plant, including costs associated with higher property taxes, depreciation and operation and maintenance expenses. An increase in the portion of distribution revenues that impacts earnings related to the absence in 2012 of the establishment of a reserve related to a wholesale billing adjustment in the third quarter of 2011 ($5 million). Partially offset by: A $5.2 million decrease in distribution revenues related to the portions that are included in DPU approved tracking mechanisms that recover certain incurred costs and do not impact earnings. The tracking mechanisms allow for rates to be changed periodically with overcollections refunded to customers or undercollections recovered from customers in future periods. Included in these amounts are Basic Service, pension, transition and energy efficiency program costs. Purchased Power and Transmission decreased in 2012, as compared to 2011, due primarily to lower purchased transmission costs ($14 million), lower Basic Service costs ($7 million) and lower purchased power costs ($3.4 million). Operations and Maintenance increased in 2012, as compared to 2011, due to an increase in distribution business expenses primarily related to higher pension costs ($3.9 million), which are recovered through DPU approved tracking mechanisms and have no earnings impact. There were also higher routine distribution overhead line maintenance costs ($2.7 million), higher transmission operating costs ($2 million) and higher uncollectible expenses ($1.9 million). In addition, there was a bill credit to customers ($3 million) in the second quarter of 2012 as a result of the Massachusetts settlement agreement. Depreciation increased in 2012, as compared to 2011, due primarily to higher utility plant balances resulting from completed construction projects placed into service related to WMECO's capital programs. Amortization of Regulatory Assets, Net decreased in 2012, as compared to 2011, due primarily to a decrease in amortization of the transition charge deferral. Energy Efficiency Programs increased in 2012, as compared to 2011, due primarily to an increase in expenses attributable to an increase in spending in accordance with DPU approved energy efficiency programs. The increase in energy efficiency spending is recovered in rates and therefore does not impact earnings. Taxes Other Than Income Taxes increased in 2012, as compared to 2011, due primarily to an increase in property taxes as a result of an increase in Property, Plant and Equipment related to WMECO capital program and an increase in the property tax rates. 70 Interest Expense For the Years Ended December 31, Increase/ (Millions of Dollars) 2012 2011 (Decrease) Percent Interest on Long-Term Debt $ 23.5 $ 20.0 $ 3.5 17.5 % Interest on RRBs 1.2 2.3 (1.1) (47.8) Other Interest 1.9 1.3 0.6 46.2 $ 26.6 $ 23.6 $ 3.0 12.7 % Interest Expense increased in 2012, as compared to 2011, due primarily to higher Interest on Long-Term Debt resulting from a $100 million long-term debt issuance in September 2011 and a $150 million long-term debt issuance on October 4, 2012.

LIQUIDITY WMECO had cash flows provided by operating activities in 2012 of $77 million, compared with operating cash flows of $108 million in 2011 (amounts are net of RRB payments, which are included in financing activities). The reduced cash flows in 2012 were due primarily to unfavorable cash flow impacts of $6.6 million relating to C&LM and $16.1 million relating to the change in transmission regulatory tracking mechanisms. In addition, WMECO paid $3 million in bill credits to customers in 2012 associated with the Massachusetts settlement agreement. 71
