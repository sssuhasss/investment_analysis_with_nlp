Item 7: Management Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations Overview General. Grainger is the leading broad-line supplier of facilities maintenance and other related products in North America. For each of the three years presented in this Annual Report on Form 10-K for the year ended December 31, 2006, Grainger reports its operating results in three segments: Grainger Branch-based, Acklands Grainger Branch-based (Acklands Grainger) and Lab Safety Supply, Inc. (Lab Safety). Grainger distributes a wide range of products used by businesses and institutions to keep their facilities and equipment up and running. Grainger uses a multichannel business model to provide customers with a range of options for finding and purchasing products through a network of branches, sales representatives, direct marketing including catalogs, and a variety of electronic and Internet channels. Grainger serves customers through a network of 593 branches, 18 distribution centers and multiple Web sites. Business Environment. Several economic factors and industry trends shape Grainger business environment. The current overall economy and leading economic indicators forecast by economists provide insight into anticipated economic factors for the near term and help in forming the development of projections for the upcoming year. At the start of 2007, Consensus Forecast-USA predicted 2007 GDP growth of 2.4% and Industrial Production growth of 2.5% for the United States, a slight decrease from preliminary fourth quarter 2006 GDP estimates. For Canada, Consensus Forecast-USA predicted 2007 GDP growth of 2.3%, below the 2006 estimate of 2.7%. In 2006, Grainger benefited from the economic growth in the United States. Grainger sales correlate positively with industrial production growth. With the improvement in Industrial Production and general growth in the economy, Grainger realized an increase in sales across all customer sectors. Grainger sales also tend to increase when non-farm payrolls grow, especially during economic recoveries. Non-farm payrolls increased approximately 1%, on average, in 2006 over 2005. For 2006, Grainger benefited from the combination of increased Industrial Production and non-farm payroll growth. The light and heavy manufacturing customer sectors, which comprised more than 25% of Grainger total 2006 sales, have historically correlated with manufacturing employment levels and manufacturing production. Manufacturing employment levels in the United States were flat during 2006, however, manufacturing output increased almost 5%. This contributed to almost double-digit sales growth in the heavy manufacturing and mid single-digit sales growth in the light manufacturing customer sectors for Grainger in 2006. Economic forecasts suggest that the manufacturing sector will continue to expand in 2007. In 2004, Grainger launched a multiyear initiative to strengthen its presence in top metropolitan markets and better position itself to serve the local customer. The market expansion program contributed to the sales growth in 2006 and is expected to be a driver of growth in 2007 and beyond. The first phase of the market expansion program was completed in 2005. Phases two through six were in various stages of completion at December 31, 2006. In 2006, Grainger launched a multiyear product line expansion program. The product line expansion program contributed to the sales growth in 2006 and is expected to be a driver of growth in 2007 and beyond. In 2007, the company plans to add approximately 25,000 additional products to supplement the plumbing, fastener, material handling and security product lines. 10 Customer buying behavior is also important in Grainger business environment. Grainger believes that customers will continue to focus on reducing their cost to procure facilities maintenance products. Consequently, during 2006, Grainger increased information available to employees for improved service to customers by installing an upgraded SAP branch operating system as part of an overall conversion to an integrated SAP system in the U.S. branch-based business. Grainger financial strength positions it to fund major initiatives and acquisitions and to improve effectiveness. Capital spending in 2006 for the market expansion program was approximately $63 million, with total capital expenditures of $139 million. For 2007, Grainger anticipates total capital expenditures of $150 million to $175 million. Grainger intends to continue its investment in the market expansion program and information technology enhancements with spending planned for the following major projects: $50 million to $80 million for continued market expansion; $10 million to $15 million for information technology; $10 million to $12 million for international expansion; $3 million to $5 million for product line expansion. Lease or purchase decisions, based on availability of facilities, may affect the timing and amount of capital expenditures associated with the market expansion program. Matters Affecting Comparability. Effective January 1, 2006, Grainger adopted SFAS No. 123R, Share-Based Payment, for the accounting of employee stock-based compensation using the modified prospective method. The effect of the adoption was approximately a $0.14 earnings per share reduction for 2006. See Note 2 to the Consolidated Financial Statements for further discussion of information related to SFAS No. 123R. During the fourth quarter of 2006, Grainger adopted SFAS No. 158, Employers Accounting for Defined Benefit Pension and Other Postretirement Plans an amendment of FASB Statements No. 87, 88, 106, and 132R. As a result of the adoption, Grainger recorded an additional liability of $36.8 million to Accrued employment-related benefit costs offset by $14.3 million of deferred income taxes and a reduction of Accumulated other comprehensive earnings of $22.5 million. See Note 2 to the Consolidated Financial Statements for further discussion of information related to SFAS No. 158. Grainger operating results for 2006 include the operating results of Rand Materials Handling Equipment Co. (Rand) from the acquisition date of January 31, 2006. Grainger operating results for 2006 also include the operating results of Professional Inspection Equipment, Inc. (Professional Equipment) and Construction Book Express, Inc. (Construction Book) from the acquisition date of November 17, 2006. The results of these acquisitions are included in the Lab Safety segment. There were 254 sales days in 2006 compared to 255 sales days in 2005. Grainger operating results for 2005 included the operating results for AW Direct from the acquisition date of January 14, 2005. AW Direct results are included in the Lab Safety segment. Results of Operations The following table is included as an aid to understanding changes in Grainger Consolidated Statements of Earnings: For the Years Ended December 31, Items in Consolidated Statements of Earnings As a Percent of Net Sales Percent Increase/(Decrease) from Prior Year 2006 2005 2004 2006 2005 Net sales 100.0% 100.0% 100.0% 6.5% 9.4% Cost of merchandise sold 60.0 60.9 62.2 4.9 7.1 Gross profit 40.0 39.1 37.8 8.9 13.4 Operating expenses 30.2 29.7 29.1 8.1 12.1 Operating earnings 9.8 9.4 8.7 11.4 17.6 Other income (expense) 0.4 0.3 0.1 82.3 252.3 Income taxes 3.7 3.4 3.1 17.9 17.8 Net earnings 6.5% 6.3% 5.7% 10.7% 20.7% 2006 Compared to 2005 Grainger net sales for 2006 of $5,883.7 million were up 6.5% versus 2005. There was one less selling day in 2006 versus 2005. Daily sales were up 6.9%. The increase in net sales was led by strong sales to the commercial, government and manufacturing sectors. Also contributing to the improvement was growth from the U.S. market expansion program. Partially offsetting these sales improvements was the negative effect of the continued wind-down of low margin contracts with integrated supply and automotive customers. 11 The gross profit margin of 40.0% in 2006 improved 0.9 percentage point over the gross profit margin of 39.1% in 2005, principally due to selling price category mix and the positive effect of product mix, including the global sourcing of products. The major driver of the improvement in the selling price category mix was reduced sales to integrated supply and automotive customers, which carry lower than average gross profit margins. Grainger operating earnings of $578.1 million in 2006 increased $59.1 million, or 11.4%, over the prior year. The operating margin of 9.8% in 2006 improved 0.4 percentage point over 2005, as the combined effect of increased sales and improvement in gross profit margin exceeded the increase in operating expenses. Operating expenses were up 8.1% in 2006 principally due to higher payroll and benefits driven by increased stock-based compensation expense due to the adoption of SFAS No. 123R, and increased healthcare and profit sharing costs, partially offset by lower systems implementation costs. In 2006, net earnings of $383.4 million increased $37.1 million, or 10.7%, over the prior year. The growth in net earnings was due to the improvement in operating earnings and higher net interest income, partially offset by an increase in income tax expense. Diluted earnings per share for 2006 of $4.24 were 12.2% higher than the $3.78 for 2005, the result of higher net income and fewer shares outstanding. Segment Analysis The following comments at the segment level include external and intersegment net sales and operating earnings. Comments at the business unit level include external and inter- and intrasegment net sales and operating earnings. See Note 17 to the Consolidated Financial Statements. Grainger Branch-based Net sales of $4,910.8 million increased by 5.6% in 2006 compared to net sales of $4,649.2 million in 2005. Daily sales were up 6.0%. Daily sales in the United States were up 6.0%, with growth in all customer end markets, led by the government and heavy manufacturing sectors. The wind-down of the Company low margin integrated supply and automotive contracts reduced sales growth by approximately 2 percentage points. In 2004, the Company launched a multiyear market expansion program to strengthen its presence in top metropolitan markets and better position itself to serve local customers. Phases 1 through 4 include sixteen markets. Work on Phases 5 and 6 began during 2006. Market expansion contributed approximately 2 percentage points to the sales growth for the segment. Results for the market expansion program were as follows: Daily Sales Increase 2006 vs. 2005 Estimated Percent Complete* Phase 1 (Atlanta, Denver, Seattle) 10% 100% Phase 2 (Four markets in Southern California) 12% 95% Phase 3 (Houston, St. Louis, Tampa) 13% 90% Phase 4 (Baltimore, Cincinnati, Kansas City, Miami, Philadelphia, Washington, D.C.) 8% 90% * Phases are reported once they reach 50% completion. Completion occurs when a new branch opens or a branch expansion or remodeling is finished. Products added in 2006 for the product line expansion program contributed approximately 2 percentage points to the growth in the segment. Daily sales in Mexico increased 20.1% in 2006 versus 2005. In local currency, daily sales were up 21.0%, driven by an improving economy, an expanded telesales operation, new branches in Santa Catarina and Chihuahua and an expanded presence in Tijuana. Segment gross profit margin increased 1.1 percentage points in 2006 over the comparable 2005 period, primarily driven by positive inflation recovery and a positive change in selling price category mix. A major driver in the improvement in selling price category mix was the reduction of sales related to low margin integrated supply and automotive contracts. Operating expenses were up 6.4% for 2006. The operating expense growth was primarily driven by higher payroll and benefits costs primarily due to higher stock-based compensation related to the adoption of SFAS No. 123R and higher profit sharing costs, partially offset by lower systems implementation costs. Operating earnings of $593.5 million for 2006 increased 13.6% over the $522.6 million for 2005. The earnings improvement resulted from higher sales and improved gross profit margins, partially offset by operating expenses, which grew at a faster rate than sales. 12 Acklands Grainger Branch-based Net sales at Acklands Grainger of $565.1 million increased by 12.6% in 2006 compared to 2005 net sales of $502.0 million, including the effect of a favorable exchange rate. Daily sales were up 13.0%. In local currency, daily sales increased 5.8% due to a stronger economy, improved branch presence, and higher sales to the oil and gas sectors, partially offset by weak sales in the forestry industry. The gross profit margin increased 0.5 percentage point in 2006 over 2005 primarily driven by positive inflation recovery. Operating expenses for Acklands Grainger were up 14.9% in 2006, primarily driven by payroll and benefits due to increased headcount and higher severance, information technology, advertising and occupancy costs. Operating earnings of $15.2 million in 2006 increased 8.8% from the $14.0 million in 2005 as a result of sales growth and an improved gross profit margin, partially offset by operating expenses which grew at a faster rate than sales. Lab Safety Net sales at Lab Safety were $411.5 million for 2006, an increase of $31.4 million, or 8.3%, when compared with $380.1 million for 2005. Daily sales were up 8.7%. The sales growth included the benefit of incremental sales from Rand, acquired on January 31, 2006, and Professional Equipment and Construction Book, acquired on November 17, 2006, as well as sales growth in the manufacturing sector. Rand contributed 4.0 percentage points to the daily sales increase. Professional Equipment and Construction Book contributed 0.6 percentage point to the daily sales increase. Excluding Rand, Professional Equipment and Construction Book, daily sales increased 4.1%. The gross profit margin decreased 0.3 percentage point in 2006 from 2005 primarily as a result of increased freight costs and lower margin Rand product sales, partially offset by positive inflation recovery. Operating expenses of $121.8 million were $12.8 million, or 11.7%, higher in 2006, primarily due to incremental costs associated with the acquisitions, higher advertising and increased expenses from the upgrade of the business ERP system. Operating earnings of $52.3 million for 2006 were down 0.8% compared to 2005, resulting from a lower gross profit margin and higher operating expenses, partially offset by increased sales. Other Income and Expense Other income and expense was $25.0 million of income in 2006, an improvement of $11.3 million as compared with $13.7 million of income in 2005. The following table summarizes the components of other income and expense: For the Years Ended December 31, 2006 2005 (In thousands of dollars) Other income and (expense): Interest income (expense) net $ 19,570 $ 11,019 Equity in income of unconsolidated entities net 2,960 2,809 Gain on sale of unconsolidated entity 2,291 Unclassified net 131 (143) $ 24,952 $ 13,685 The improvement in other income and expense in 2006 over 2005 was primarily attributable to higher interest income and the gain on the sale of Acklands Grainger interest in the USI-AGI Prairies joint venture. The increase in interest income in 2006 was the result of higher interest rates and higher average cash balances. Income Taxes Income taxes of $219.6 million in 2006 increased 17.9% as compared with $186.4 million in 2005. Grainger effective tax rates were 36.4% and 35.0% in 2006 and 2005, respectively. Excluding the effect of equity in unconsolidated entities, which is recorded net of tax, the effective income tax rates were 36.7% for 2006 and 35.2% for 2005. The 2006 tax rate benefited from resolution of uncertainties related to the audit of the 2004 tax year and from a reduction of deferred tax liabilities related to property, buildings and equipment. The 2005 tax rate included tax benefits related to a favorable revision to the estimate of income taxes for various state and local taxing jurisdictions and the resolution of certain federal and state tax contingencies. For 2007, Grainger is projecting its estimated effective tax rate to be 38.5%, excluding the effects of equity in unconsolidated entities. 13 2005 Compared to 2004 Grainger net sales for 2005 of $5,526.6 million were up 9.4% versus 2004. The increase in net sales was led by strong sales to the commercial, government, manufacturing and natural resource sectors. Also contributing to the improvement was growth from the U.S. market expansion program. Partially offsetting these sales improvements was the negative effect of the wind-down of integrated supply and related automotive contracts. The gross profit margin of 39.1% in 2005 improved 1.3 percentage points over the gross profit margin of 37.8% in 2004, principally due to selling price category mix and the positive effect of product mix, including the global sourcing of products. A major driver of the improvement in the selling price category mix was reduced sales to integrated supply and automotive customers, which carry lower than average gross profit margins. Grainger operating earnings of $519.0 million in 2005 increased $77.7 million, or 17.6%, over the prior year. The operating margin of 9.4% in 2005 improved 0.7 percentage point over 2004, as the combined effect of increased sales and improvement in gross profit margin exceeded the increase in operating expenses. Operating expenses were up 12.1% in 2005 principally due to higher variable compensation and benefits associated with the improved performance for the year, as well as to incremental costs related to the market expansion and information technology programs. In 2005, net earnings of $346.3 million increased $59.4 million, or 20.7%, over the prior year. The growth in net earnings was due to the improvement in operating earnings, higher net interest income and a lower tax rate. Diluted earnings per share for 2005 of $3.78 were 20.8% higher than the $3.13 for 2004. Segment Analysis The following comments at the segment level include external and intersegment net sales and operating earnings. Comments at the business unit level include external and inter- and intrasegment net sales and operating earnings. See Note 17 to the Consolidated Financial Statements. Grainger Branch-based Net sales of $4,649.2 million in 2005 increased 8.5% over 2004 net sales of $4,283.3 million. Sales in the United States were up 8.4% over the prior year. All customer segments increased, with the strongest sales growth in the commercial, government and manufacturing sectors. National account sales, which include all customer segments, were up 11.9%. The wind-down of integrated supply and automotive contracts reduced sales growth by approximately 2 percentage points. In 2004, the Company launched a multiyear market expansion program to strengthen its presence in top metropolitan markets and better position itself to serve local customers. Phases 1 through 3 included ten markets. As of the fourth quarter of 2005, the Company began Phase 4 of the program. Additional phases began in 2006. Sales Increase 2005 vs. 2004 Estimated Percent Complete* Phase 1 (Atlanta, Denver, Seattle) 10% 100% Phase 2 (Four markets in Southern California) 14% 90% Phase 3 (Houston, St. Louis, Tampa) 19% 70% * Phases are reported once they reach 50% completion. Completion occurs when a new branch opens or a branch expansion or remodeling is finished. Overall, market expansion contributed approximately 1 percentage point to the segment sales growth. The sales growth in Phase 1 was negatively affected in the Denver market due to lower sales to one large customer. Excluding the effect of this customer, sales in Phase 1 were up 13%. Sales in Mexico were up 18.6% in 2005 as compared to 2004, driven by a strong local economy, expanded telesales operations and improved sales to national accounts. Cost of merchandise sold of $2,817.5 million increased $155.2 million, or 5.8%, over 2004 due to increased volume. Gross profit margins improved 1.6 percentage points to 39.4% in 2005 from 37.8% in 2004. Contributing to the improvement in gross profit margin were selling price category mix and the positive effect of product mix, which included the global sourcing of additional products. The major driver of the improvement in selling price category mix was reduced sales to integrated supply and automotive customers, which carry lower than average gross margins. Operating expenses for the Grainger Branch-based businesses increased 11.3% in 2005. Operating expenses were up primarily as a result of payroll and benefits costs. Payroll increases were due to higher headcount to support strategic initiatives including the market expansion program and information technology upgrades. In addition, sales commissions and profit sharing accruals increased due to the improved 2005 performance. Partially offsetting these increases was lower bad debt expense, the result of improved collections and reduced write-offs. 14 In 2005, operating earnings of $522.6 million increased by $78.1 million, or 17.6%, over 2004. The improvement was the result of sales growth, combined with the improvement in gross profit margin, and was partially offset by operating expenses, which grew faster than sales. Acklands Grainger Branch-based Net sales at Acklands Grainger of $502.0 million increased by 15.6% in 2005 compared to 2004 net sales of $434.3 million, including the effect of a favorable Canadian exchange rate. In local currency, sales increased 7.7%, primarily due to strength in the Canadian economy driven by the natural resources sector. The gross profit margin increased 0.3 percentage point in 2005 over 2004 primarily due to positive inflation recovery. Operating expenses were up 24.8% in 2005, primarily driven by payroll and benefits due to increased headcount and bonus accruals, and higher information technology, advertising and occupancy costs. Operating earnings decreased 33.2% in 2005, primarily driven by increased operating expenses which grew at a faster rate than sales, partially offset by a slightly improved gross margin. Lab Safety Net sales at Lab Safety were $380.1 million in 2005, an increase of $43.4 million, or 12.9%, when compared with $336.7 million of sales in 2004. Higher sales were principally driven by incremental sales from AW Direct, which was acquired on January 14, 2005. Excluding AW Direct, sales increased 4.0 percentage points over 2004. The gross profit margin of 42.5% increased 0.7 percentage point when compared to the gross profit margin of 41.8% for 2004. Contributing to the improvement was a favorable selling price category mix, partially offset by the negative effect of AW Direct sales, which carry lower gross profit margins. Operating expenses were $109.0 million in 2005, up $13.7 million, or 14.3%, over 2004. The increase over the prior year was principally driven by higher variable compensation expense related to the strong performance for the year and higher catalog media costs, partially offset by lower data processing expense related to fully amortized enterprise software. Also contributing to the increase were costs associated with the AW Direct acquisition. Operating earnings of $52.7 million were up 15.9% in 2005 over 2004, resulting primarily from the increase in sales and the improved gross profit margin, partially offset by increased operating expenses. Other Income and Expense Other income and expense was $13.7 million of income in 2005, an improvement of $9.8 million as compared with $3.9 million of income in 2004. The following table summarizes the components of other income and expense: For the Years Ended December 31, 2005 2004 (In thousands of dollars) Other income and (expense): Interest income (expense) net $ 11,019 $ 1,988 Equity in income of unconsolidated entities net 2,809 996 Gain on sale of unconsolidated entity 750 Unclassified net (143) 151 $ 13,685 $ 3,885 The improvement in other income and expense in 2005 over 2004 was primarily attributable to higher interest income and lower interest expense and improvement in the results of unconsolidated entities. The increase in interest income in 2005 was primarily the result of higher interest rates. Interest expense decreased due to the payment of the cross-currency swap in September 2004. Income Taxes Income taxes of $186.4 million in 2005 increased 17.8% as compared with $158.2 million in 2004. Grainger effective tax rates were 35.0% and 35.5% in 2005 and 2004, respectively. Excluding the effect of equity in unconsolidated entities, which is recorded net of tax, the effective income tax rates were 35.2% for 2005 and 35.6% for 2004. The 2005 tax rate included tax benefits related to a favorable revision to the estimate of income taxes for various state and local taxing jurisdictions and the resolution of certain federal and state tax contingencies. The tax rate in 2004 included the realization of tax benefits related to operations in Mexico and to capital losses, the recognition of tax benefits from the Medicare Act and the resolution of certain federal and state tax contingencies. 15 Financial Condition Grainger expects its strong working capital position and cash flows from operations to continue, allowing it to fund its operations including growth initiatives and capital expenditures, and to repurchase shares, as well as pay cash dividends at or above historical levels. Cash Flow Net cash flows from operations of $436.8 million in 2006, $432.5 million in 2005 and $406.5 million in 2004 continued to improve Grainger financial position and serve as the primary source of funding. Net cash provided by operations increased $4.3 million in 2006 over 2005, driven primarily by increased net earnings. The Change in operating assets and liabilities net of business acquisitions and joint venture contributions used cash of $97.2 million in 2006. The use of cash was primarily driven by increases in inventory and trade accounts receivable, which were up due to increased sales throughout 2006 and an increase in days sales outstanding. These changes were partially offset by an increase in trade accounts payable due to the higher inventory purchases. The increase in net cash flows from operations from 2004 to 2005 was primarily attributable to increased net earnings. The Change in operating assets and liabilities net of business acquisitions and joint venture contributions used cash of $57.1 million in 2005. The use of cash was primarily driven by increases in inventory and trade accounts receivable, which were up due to higher inventory purchases and sales in December. These changes were partially offset by an increase in trade accounts payable due to the higher inventory purchases and increases in profit sharing and compensation-related accruals, driven by an improved 2005 performance. Net cash flows used in investing activities were $139.7 million, $163.0 million and $142.4 million for 2006, 2005 and 2004, respectively. Capital expenditures for property, buildings, equipment and capitalized software were $136.8 million, $157.2 million and $160.8 million in 2006, 2005 and 2004, respectively. Additional information regarding capital spending is detailed in the Capital Expenditures section below. In 2006, Grainger also invested $13.9 million to purchase Rand and $20.5 million to purchase Professional Equipment and Construction Book, which are part of the Lab Safety segment. The results of operations for Rand have been included in the consolidated financial statements since the acquisition date of January 31, 2006, and the results of operations for Professional Equipment and Construction Book have been included in the consolidated financial statements since the acquisition date of November 17, 2006. Net cash flows used in financing activities for 2006, 2005 and 2004 were $492.9 million, $154.1 million and $240.6 million, respectively. Treasury stock purchases increased $335.3 million in 2006, as Grainger repurchased 6,950,900 shares, compared with 2,404,400 shares in 2005. Treasury stock purchases were 2,001,000 shares in 2004. As of December 31, 2006, approximately 7.7 million shares of common stock remained available under Grainger repurchase authorization. Dividends paid to shareholders were $97.9 million in 2006, $82.7 million in 2005 and $71.2 million in 2004. Partially offsetting these cash outlays were proceeds from stock options exercised of $64.4 million, $66.0 million and $72.3 million for 2006, 2005 and 2004, respectively. During 2004, Grainger liquidated its cross-currency swap and related commercial paper debt with payments totaling $140.8 million. Working Capital Internally generated funds have been the primary source of working capital and for funds used in business expansion, supplemented by debt as circumstances dictated. In addition, funds were expended for facilities optimization and enhancements to support growth initiatives, as well as for business and systems development and other infrastructure improvements. Working capital was $1,155.8 million at December 31, 2006, compared with $1,290.2 million at December 31, 2005, and $1,108.4 million at December 31, 2004. At these dates, the ratio of current assets to current liabilities was 2.6, 2.9 and 2.7, respectively. Capital Expenditures In each of the past three years, a portion of operating cash flow has been used for additions to property, buildings, equipment and capitalized software as summarized in the following table: For the Years Ended December 31, 2006 2005 2004 (In thousands of dollars) Land, buildings, structures and improvements $ 67,554 $ 52,955 $ 41,929 Furniture, fixtures, machinery and equipment 62,233 59,342 86,347 Subtotal 129,787 112,297 128,276 Capitalized software 8,950 44,950 32,482 Total $ 138,737 $ 157,247 $ 160,758 16 In 2006, Grainger investments included the market expansion program, which is designed to realign branches in several metropolitan markets, international expansion and the normal, recurring replacement of equipment. In 2005 and 2004, Grainger investments included the market expansion program, ongoing SAP initiatives, expenditures related to Canadian branch and systems projects, as well as the normal, recurring replacement of equipment. Capital expenditures are expected to range from $150 million to $175 million in 2007 and include investments for the ongoing market expansion program, information technology, international expansion, as well as other general projects including the normal, recurring replacement of equipment. Grainger expects to fund 2007 capital investments from operating cash flows, which Grainger believes will remain strong. Debt Grainger maintains a debt ratio and liquidity position that provides flexibility in funding working capital needs and long-term cash requirements. In addition to internally generated funds, Grainger has various sources of financing available, including commercial paper sales and bank borrowings under lines of credit. At December 31, 2006, Grainger long-term debt rating by Standard & Poor was AA+. Grainger available lines of credit, as further discussed in Note 8 to the Consolidated Financial Statements, were $250.0 million at December 31, 2006, 2005 and 2004. Total debt as a percent of total capitalization was 0.4%, 0.4% and 0.5% as of the same dates. Grainger entered into a two-year cross-currency swap on September 25, 2002. On September 27, 2004, the cross-currency swap and related commercial paper debt matured and were liquidated with payments totaling $140.8 million. See Note 10 to the Consolidated Financial Statements. Grainger believes any circumstances that would trigger early payment or acceleration with respect to any outstanding debt securities would not have a material impact on its results of operations or financial condition. Certain holders of industrial revenue bonds have various rights to require Grainger to redeem these bonds, thus a portion is classified as Current maturities of long-term debt. Commitments and Other Contractual Obligations At December 31, 2006, Grainger contractual obligations, including estimated payments due by period, are as follows: Payments Due by Period Total Amounts Committed Less than 1 Year 1 3 Years 4 5 Years More than 5 Years (In thousands of dollars) Long-term debt obligations $ 9,485 $ 4,590 $ $ 4,895 $ Operating lease obligations 168,900 34,221 69,253 30,138 35,288 Purchase obligations: Uncompleted additions to property, buildings and equipment 48,027 48,027 Commitments to purchase inventory 213,904 213,904 Other purchase obligations 79,730 48,300 30,563 867 Other liabilities 118,715 12,840 13,559 92,316 Total $ 638,761 $ 349,042 $ 112,656 $ 49,459 $ 127,604 Purchase obligations consist primarily of inventory purchases made in the normal course of business to meet operating needs. While purchase orders for both inventory purchases and noninventory purchases are generally cancelable without penalty, certain vendor agreements provide for cancellation fees or penalties depending on the terms of the contract. Payments for Other liabilities represent future benefit payments for postretirement benefit plans and postemployment disability medical benefits as determined by actuarial projections. Other employment-related benefits costs of $32.3 million have not been included in this table as the timing of benefit payments is not as statistically predictable. See Note 9 to the Consolidated Financial Statements. See also Notes 10 and 11 to the Consolidated Financial Statements. 17 Off-Balance Sheet Arrangements Grainger does not have any material exposures to off-balance sheet arrangements. Grainger does not have any variable interest entities or activities that include nonexchange-traded contracts accounted for at fair value. Critical Accounting Estimates The preparation of financial statements, in conformity with accounting principles generally accepted in the United States of America, requires management to make judgments, estimates and assumptions that affect the reported amounts of assets, liabilities, revenues and expenses in the financial statements. Management bases its estimates on historical experience and other assumptions, which it believes are reasonable. If actual amounts are ultimately different from these estimates, the revisions are included in Grainger results of operations for the period in which the actual amounts become known. Accounting policies are considered critical when they require management to make assumptions about matters that are highly uncertain at the time the estimate is made and when different estimates than those management reasonably could have made have a material impact on the presentation of Grainger financial condition, changes in financial condition or results of operations. Note 2 to the Consolidated Financial Statements describes the significant accounting policies used in the preparation of the Consolidated Financial Statements. The most significant areas involving management judgments and estimates follow. Actual results in these areas could differ materially from management estimates under different assumptions or conditions. Postretirement Healthcare Benefits . Postretirement obligations and net periodic costs are dependent on assumptions and estimates used in calculating such amounts. The assumptions used include, among others, discount rates, assumed rates of return on plan assets and healthcare cost trend rates. Changes in assumptions (caused by conditions in equity markets or plan experience, for example) could have a material effect on Grainger postretirement benefit obligations and expense, and could affect its results of operations and financial condition. These changes in assumptions may also affect voluntary decisions to make additional contributions to the trust established for funding the postretirement benefit obligation. The discount rate assumptions used by management reflect the rates available on high-quality fixed income debt instruments as of December 31, the measurement date, of each year in accordance with Statement of Financial Accounting Standards (SFAS) No. 106, Employers Accounting for Postretirement Benefits Other Than Pensions. A lower discount rate increases the present value of benefit obligations and net periodic postretirement benefit costs. As of December 31, 2006, Grainger increased the discount rate used in the calculation of its postretirement plan obligation from 5.5% to 5.9% to reflect the increase in market interest rates. Grainger estimates that the increase in the expected discount rate will increase 2007 pretax earnings by approximately $1.4 million, although other changes in assumptions may increase, decrease or eliminate this effect. Grainger considers the long-term historical actual return on plan assets and the historical performance of the Standard & Poor 500 Index in developing its expected long-term return on plan assets. In 2006, Grainger maintained the expected long-term rate of return on plan assets of 6.0% (net of tax at 40%) based on the historical average of long-term rates of return. Grainger may terminate or modify the postretirement plan at any time, subject to the provisions of the Employee Retirement Income Security Act of 1974 (ERISA) and the Internal Revenue Code, as amended. In the event the postretirement plan is terminated, all assets of the Group Benefit Trust inure to the benefit of the participants. The foregoing assumptions are based on the presumption that the postretirement plan will continue. Were the postretirement plan to terminate, different actuarial assumptions and other factors might be applicable. Grainger has used its best judgment in making assumptions and estimates and believes such assumptions and estimates used are appropriate. Changes to the assumptions may be required in future years as a result of actual experience or new trends and, therefore, may affect Grainger retirement plan obligations and future expense. For additional information concerning postretirement healthcare benefits, see Note 9 to the Consolidated Financial Statements. Insurance Reserves. Grainger retains a significant portion of the risk of certain losses related to workers compensation, general liability and property losses through the utilization of deductibles and self-insured retentions. There are also certain other risk areas for which Grainger does not maintain insurance. Grainger is responsible for establishing policies on insurance reserves. Although it relies on outside parties to project future claims costs, it retains control over actuarial assumptions, including loss development factors and claim payment patterns. Grainger performs ongoing reviews of its insured and uninsured risks, which it uses to establish the appropriate reserve levels. 18 The use of assumptions in the analysis leads to fluctuations in required reserves over time. Any change in the required reserve balance is reflected in the current period results of operations. Allowance for Doubtful Accounts . Grainger uses several factors to estimate the allowance for uncollectible accounts receivable including the age of the receivables and the historical ratio of actual write-offs to the age of the receivables. The analyses performed also take into consideration economic conditions that may have an impact on a specific industry, group of customers or a specific customer. Write-offs could be materially different than the reserves provided if economic conditions change or actual results deviate from historical trends. Inventory Reserves. Grainger establishes inventory reserves for shrinkage and excess and obsolete inventory. Provisions for inventory shrinkage are based on historical experience to account for unmeasured usage or loss. Actual inventory shrinkage could be materially different from these estimates affecting Grainger inventory values and cost of merchandise sold. Grainger regularly reviews inventory to evaluate continued demand and identify any obsolete or excess quantities of inventory. Grainger records provisions for the difference between excess and obsolete inventory and its estimated realizable value. Estimated realizable value is based on anticipated future product demand, market conditions and liquidation values. Actual results differing from these projections could have a material effect on Grainger results of operations. Income Taxes. Grainger accounts for income taxes in accordance with SFAS No. 109, Accounting for Income Taxes. Under SFAS No. 109, deferred tax assets and liabilities are determined based on the differences between the financial statement and tax bases of assets and liabilities, using enacted tax rates in effect for the year in which the differences are expected to reverse. The tax balances and income tax expense recognized by Grainger are based on management interpretations of the tax laws of multiple jurisdictions. Income tax expense reflects Grainger best estimates and assumptions regarding, among other items, the level of future taxable income, interpretation of tax laws and tax planning opportunities. Future rulings by tax authorities and future changes in tax laws and their interpretation, changes in projected levels of taxable income and future tax planning strategies could impact the actual effective tax rate and tax balances recorded by Grainger. Other. Other significant accounting policies, not involving the same level of measurement uncertainties as those discussed above, are nevertheless important to an understanding of the financial statements. Policies relating to revenue recognition, depreciation, intangibles, long-lived assets and warranties require judgments on complex matters that are often subject to multiple external sources of authoritative guidance such as the Financial Accounting Standards Board and the Securities and Exchange Commission. Possible changes in estimates or assumptions associated with these policies are not expected to have a material effect on the financial condition or results of operations of Grainger. More information on these additional accounting policies can be found in Note 2 to the Consolidated Financial Statements. New Accounting Standards The following new accounting standards exclude those pronouncements that are unlikely to have an effect on Grainger upon adoption. In July 2006, the Financial Accounting Standards Board (FASB) issued Interpretation No. 48 (FIN 48), Accounting for Uncertainty in Income Taxes an interpretation of FASB Statement No. 109. FIN 48 clarifies the accounting for uncertainty in income taxes recognized in a company financial statements in accordance with SFAS No. 109, Accounting for Income Taxes. FIN 48 prescribes a recognition threshold and measurement attribute for the financial statement recognition and measure of a tax position taken or expected to be taken in a tax return. It also provides guidance on derecognition, classification, interest and penalties, accounting in interim periods, disclosure, and transition. FIN 48 is effective for fiscal years beginning after December 15, 2006. The Company does not expect adoption of FIN 48 to have a material effect on its results of operations or financial position. In September 2006, the FASB issued SFAS No. 157, Fair Value Measurements. SFAS No. 157 defines fair value, establishes a framework for measuring fair value in accordance with generally accepted accounting principles and expands disclosures about fair value measurements. The provisions of SFAS No. 157 are effective for fiscal years beginning after November 15, 2007. The Company is currently evaluating the impact adoption may have on its results of operations or financial position. 19 In September 2006, the FASB issued SFAS No. 158, Employers Accounting for Defined Benefit Pension and Other Postretirement Plans an amendment of FASB Statements No. 87, 88, 106, and 132R. SFAS No. 158 requires an employer to recognize in its statement of financial position an asset for a plan overfunded status or a liability for a plan underfunded status, measure a plan assets and its obligations that determine its funded status as of the end of the employer fiscal year (with limited exceptions), and recognize changes in the funded status of a defined benefit postretirement plan in the year in which the changes occur. SFAS No. 158 requires funded status changes of a defined benefit postretirement plan within accumulated other comprehensive income, net of tax, to the extent such changes are not recognized in earnings as components of net periodic benefit costs. SFAS No. 158 is effective for fiscal years ending after December 15, 2006. The Company adopted SFAS No. 158 during the fourth quarter of 2006. As a result of the adoption, Grainger recorded an additional liability of $36.8 million to Accrued employment-related benefit costs, offset by $14.3 million of deferred income taxes and a reduction of Accumulated other comprehensive earnings of $22.5 million. See Note 2 to the Consolidated Financial Statements for further discussion of information related to SFAS No. 158. In September 2006, the SEC issued Staff Accounting Bulletin (SAB) No. 108, Considering the Effects of Prior Year Misstatements when Quantifying Misstatements in the Current Year Financial Statements. SAB No. 108 addresses how the effects of prior year uncorrected misstatements should be considered when quantifying misstatements in current year financial statements. SAB No. 108 requires an entity to quantify misstatements using a balance sheet and income statement approach and to evaluate whether either approach results in quantifying an error that is material in light of relevant quantitative and qualitative factors. The adoption of SAB No. 108 is effective for fiscal years ending on or after November 15, 2006. The Company adopted SAB No. 108 during the fourth quarter of 2006. The adoption of SAB No. 108 did not have a material effect on the Company results of operations or financial position. See Note 2 to the Consolidated Financial Statements for further discussion of new accounting standards. Inflation and Changing Prices Inflation during the last three years has not had a significant effect on operations. The predominant use of the last-in, first-out (LIFO) method of accounting for inventories and accelerated depreciation methods for financial reporting and income tax purposes result in a substantial recognition of the effects of inflation in the financial statements. The major impact of inflation is on buildings and improvements, where the gap between historic cost and replacement cost continues for these long-lived assets. The related depreciation expense associated with these assets increases if adjustments were to be made for the cumulative effect of inflation. Grainger believes the most positive means to combat inflation and advance the interests of investors lies in the continued application of basic business principles, which include improving productivity, increasing working capital turnover and offering products and services which can command appropriate prices in the marketplace. Forward-Looking Statements This document contains forward-looking statements under the federal securities laws. The forward-looking statements relate to Grainger expected future financial results and business plans, strategies and objectives and are not historical facts. They are often identified by qualifiers such as will, could, should, might, may, would, tend, planned, presumption, expects, intends, is likely, anticipates, scheduled, believes, positions it, continue, estimates, forecast, predicting, projection, potential, assumption or similar expressions. There are risks and uncertainties the outcome of which could cause Grainger results to differ materially from what is projected. Factors that may affect forward-looking statements include the following: higher product costs or other expenses; a major loss of customers; increased competitive pricing pressure on Grainger businesses; failure to develop or implement new technologies or other business strategies; the outcome of pending and future litigation or governmental or regulatory proceedings relating to claims, inquiries or audits; changes in laws and regulations; facilities disruptions or shutdowns; disruptions in transportation services; natural and other catastrophes; unanticipated weather conditions; and other difficulties in achieving or improving margins or financial performance. Trends and projections could also be affected by general industry and market conditions, gross domestic product growth rates, general economic conditions including interest rate and currency rate fluctuations, global and other conflicts, employment levels and other factors. 20
