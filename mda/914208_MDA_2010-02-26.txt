Item 7. Management Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations Executive Overview The following executive overview summarizes the significant trends affecting our results of operations and financial condition for the periods presented. This overview and the remainder of this management discussion and analysis supplements, and should be read in conjunction with, the Consolidated Financial Statements of Invesco Ltd. and its subsidiaries (collectively, the company or Invesco ) and the notes thereto contained elsewhere in this Annual Report on Form 10-K. Although the global equity markets began to recover after the first quarter of 2009, they began the year under extreme pressure, as illustrated in the table below. It is important to note that the markets remain below their historical highs, with the S&P down 25.73% from October 2007 to January 2010. In expectation of volatile financial markets, Invesco senior leadership adopted a disciplined approach to our business beginning in 2008. A key component of this approach was to significantly reduce discretionary spending, freeing resources which enabled the company to reinvest in opportunities that would strengthen our business over the long term and enhance our competitive position. This approach served the company well over the past two years during which the Dow Jones Industrial Average saw its worst year of performance since 1931 (in 2008), and other markets around the globe suffered significant declines as well. After bottoming out in March 2009, global financial markets staged a dramatic recovery with several major global market indices rebounding in record fashion off of record declines in 2008. The response from governments and central banks around the world to the financial crisis in 2008 was an unprecedented amount of monetary and fiscal stimulus. Central banks lowered interest rates to near zero, issued a number of debt guarantees for banks and other non-bank financial institutions, and began to increase the supply of money through open market asset purchases. Additionally, governments around the globe passed legislation that poured billions of dollars into the global economy. These actions alleviated the risk aversion that dominated the latter half of 2008 and as a result financial markets rallied in 2009. The Dow Jones Industrial Average climbed 53.8% off of March lows to finish the year up 22.6%. The NASDAQ Composite Index rebounded 78.9% above its March low to return 45.2% for the full year. The FTSE 100 gained 22.1% in 2009, its largest advance since 1997. The largest returns were found in the emerging markets as the MSCI Emerging Market Index returned 79.0% for the year. The dramatic easing of monetary policy also contributed to major improvements in the credit markets. As interest rates remained close to zero investors fled the relative safety of U.S. Treasury securities for riskier asset classes, such as investment grade, high yield, and emerging market bonds, in search of yield. Credit spreads tightened to levels not seen since the bankruptcy of Lehman Brothers in September 2008 providing corporations around the world access to capital markets. Additionally, the U.S. dollar weakened from March until December as investors redeployed from the relative safety of U.S. Treasury securities into non-U.S. investments. 25 Table of Contents In spite of the difficult operating environment over the past year, Invesco continued to make progress in a number of areas that further positioned our company for a time when the markets return. Throughout the course of 2009, the company financial performance strengthened. In addition, during this period, Invesco continued to strengthen its competitive position with respect to investment performance, maintain its focus on its clients, and enhance its profile in the industry. A critical factor in Invesco ability to weather the economic storms of the past two years was our integrated approach to risk management. Our risk management framework provides the basis for consistent and meaningful risk dialogue up, down and across the company. Our Global Performance Measurement and Risk group provides senior management and the Board with insight into core investment risks, while our Corporate Risk Management Committee facilitates a focus on strategic, operational and all other business risks. Further, a network of business unit, functional and geographic risk management committees maintains an ongoing risk assessment process that provides a bottom-up perspective on the specific risk areas existing in various domains of our business. Through this regular and consistent risk communication, the Board has reasonable assurance that all material risks of the company are being addressed and that the company is propagating a risk-aware culture in which good risk management is built into the fabric of the business. In addition, we benefited from having a diversified asset base. One of Invesco core strengths and a key differentiator for the company within the industry is our broad diversification across client domiciles, asset classes and distribution channels. Our geographical diversification recognizes growth opportunities in different parts of the world. Invesco is also diversified by asset class, with 41% of our assets under management in equities and the remaining 59% covering the risk spectrum from alternatives to money market. Invesco assets are roughly split between retail and institutional, and the private wealth management channel provides further diversification. This broad diversification enables Invesco to weather different market cycles and take advantage of growth opportunities in various markets and channels. A significant portion of our business and assets under management (AUM) is based outside of the U.S. The strengthening or weakening of the U.S. dollar against other currencies, primarily the Pound Sterling and the Canadian dollar, will impact our reported revenues and expenses from period to period. Additionally, our revenues are directly influenced by the level and composition of our AUM. Therefore, movements in global capital market levels, net new business inflows (or outflows) and changes in the mix of investment products between asset classes and geographies may materially affect our revenues from period to period. The returns from most global capital markets increased in the three months and year ended December 31, 2009, which also contributed to net increases in AUM of $6.2 billion and $65.9 billion during the respective periods. AUM at January 31, 2010, was $412.6 billion. Summary operating information for 2009 and 2008 is presented in the table below. Year ended December 31, 2009 2008 Operating revenues $ 2,627.3 m $ 3,307.6 m Net revenues (1) $ 1,978.7 m $ 2,489.4 m Operating margin 18.4 % 22.6 % Net operating margin (2) 25.9 % 31.6 % Net income attributable to common shareholders $ 322.5 m $ 481.7 m Diluted EPS $ 0.76 $ 1.21 Average assets under management (in billions) $ 388.7 $ 440.6 (1) Net revenues are operating revenues less third-party distribution, service and advisory expenses plus our proportional share of the net revenues of our joint venture investments. See Schedule of Non-GAAP Information for the reconciliation of operating revenues to net revenues. (2) Net operating margin is net operating income divided by net revenues. See Schedule of Non-GAAP Information for the reconciliation of operating income to net operating income. 26 Table of Contents On October 19, 2009, the company announced that it entered into a definitive agreement to acquire Morgan Stanley retail asset management business, including Van Kampen Investments. The transaction was valued at $1.5 billion (subject to adjustment), consisting of payments by Invesco of $500.0 million in cash and an aggregate of approximately 44.1 million Invesco common shares and non-voting common equivalent preferred shares, which will result in Morgan Stanley obtaining an approximately 9.3% equity interest in our company. The transaction has been approved by the boards of directors of both companies and is expected to close in mid-2010, subject to customary regulatory, client and fund shareholder approvals. Investment Capabilities Performance Overview Invesco first strategic priority is to achieve strong investment performance over the long-term for our clients. Performance in our equities capabilities, as measured by the percentage of AUM ahead of benchmark and ahead of peer median, is generally strong with some pockets of outstanding performance. Within our equity asset class, U.S. Core, U.K., Asian, European, and Global ex-U.S. and Emerging Markets have had strong relative performance versus competitors and versus benchmark over three- and five-year periods. Within our fixed income asset class, products have achieved strong long-term performance with at least 62% of AUM ahead of benchmarks and 70% of AUM ahead of peers on a 3-year and 5-year basis.

Certain funds and products were excluded from the analysis because of limited benchmark or peer group data. Had these been available, results may have been different. These results are preliminary and subject to revision. Performance assumes the reinvestment of dividends. Past performance is not indicative of future results and may not reflect an investor experience. 27 Table of Contents Assets Under Management AUM at December 31, 2009, were $423.1 billion, compared to $357.2 billion at December 31, 2008. The increase in AUM during the year was due to $46.1 billion in increased market values, $10.9 billion impact of more favorable foreign exchange rates, and total net inflows of $8.9 billion (long-term net flows plus net flows in institutional money market funds). Average AUM for 2009 were $388.7 billion, compared to $440.6 billion in 2008. Our retail total net inflows for 2009 were $11.0 billion, compared to total net outflows of $10.6 billion in 2008. Institutional net outflows were $2.5 billion in 2009, compared to total net outflows of $3.1 billion in 2008. Our Private Wealth Management (PWM) channel had total net inflows of $0.4 billion in 2009 compared to total net inflows of $0.2 billion in 2008. Net revenue yield on AUM declined 5.6 basis points to 50.9 basis points in the year ended December 31, 2009, from the year ended December 31, 2008, level of 56.5 basis points, resulting from market driven changes in our asset mix and an 11.8% decline in average AUM from the year ended December 31, 2008. Our equity AUM generally earn a higher net revenue rate than money market AUM. Net revenues declined 20.5% during the year ended December 31, 2009, compared to the year ended December 31, 2008. Gross revenue yield on AUM declined 7.6 basis points to 68.2 basis points in the year ended December 31, 2009, from the year ended December 31, 2008, level of 75.8 basis points. See Schedule of Non-GAAP Information for a reconciliation of operating revenues (gross revenues) to net revenues.

Our share of the average AUM for our JVs in China was $3.7 billion in 2009 (2008: $4.5 billion; 2007: $4.2 billion). It is appropriate to exclude the average AUM of our JVs for purposes of computing gross revenue yield on AUM, because the revenues resulting from these AUM are not presented in our operating revenues. Under U.S. GAAP, our share of the pre-tax earnings of the JVs is recorded as equity in earnings of unconsolidated affiliates on our Consolidated Statements of Income. (2) Net revenue yield on AUM is equal to annualized net revenues divided by average AUM.

Results of Operations Results of Operations for the Year Ended December 31, 2009, Compared with the Year Ended December 31, 2008 Operating Revenues and Net Revenues Operating revenues decreased by 20.6% in 2009 to $2,627.3 million (2008: $3,307.6 million). Net revenues are operating revenues less third-party distribution, service and advisory expenses, plus our proportional share of net revenues from joint venture arrangements. Net revenues decreased by 20.5% in 2009 to $1,978.7 million (2008: $2,489.4 million). See Schedule of Non-GAAP Information for additional important disclosures regarding the use of net revenues. A significant portion of our business and managed AUM are based outside of the U.S. The income statements of foreign currency subsidiaries are translated into U.S. dollars, the reporting currency of the company, using average foreign exchange rates. Over the course of the year, the average U.S. dollar foreign exchange rate was stronger when compared to other currencies, primarily the Pound Sterling, Canadian dollar and Euro, which impacted our reported revenues for the year ended December 31, 2009, as compared to the year ended December 31, 2008. The impact of foreign exchange rate movements resulted in $152.0 million (22.3%) of the decline in operating revenues during the year ended December 31, 2009. Additionally, our revenues are directly influenced by the level and composition of our AUM as more fully discussed below. Movements in global capital market levels, net new business inflows (or outflows) and changes in the mix of investment products between asset classes and geographies may materially affect our revenues from period to period. 31 Table of Contents The main categories of revenues, and the dollar and percentage change between the periods, are as follows: $ in millions 2009 2008 $ Change %Change Investment management fees 2,120.2 2,617.8 (497.6 ) (19.0 )% Service and distribution fees 412.6 512.5 (99.9 ) (19.5 )% Performance fees 30.0 75.1 (45.1 ) (60.1 )% Other 64.5 102.2 (37.7 ) (36.9 )% Total operating revenues 2,627.3 3,307.6 (680.3 ) (20.6 )% Third-party distribution, service and advisory expenses (693.4 ) (875.5 ) 182.1 (20.8 )% Proportional share of revenues, net of third-party distribution expenses, from joint venture investments 44.8 57.3 (12.5 ) (21.8 )% Net revenues 1,978.7 2,489.4 (510.7 ) (20.5 )% Investment Management Fees Investment management fees are derived from providing professional services to manage client accounts and include fees earned from retail mutual funds, unit trusts, investment companies with variable capital (ICVCs), exchange-traded funds, investment trusts and institutional and private wealth management advisory contracts. Investment management fees for products offered in the retail distribution channel are generally calculated as a percentage of the daily average asset balances and therefore vary as the levels of AUM change resulting from inflows, outflows and market movements. Investment management fees for products offered in the institutional and private wealth management distribution channels are calculated in accordance with the underlying investment management contracts and also vary in relation to the level of client assets managed. Investment management fees decreased 19.0% in 2009 to $2,120.2 million (2008: $2,617.8 million) due to decreases in average AUM during the year, changes in the mix of AUM between various asset classes, and foreign exchange rate movements. Average AUM for the year ended December 31, 2009, were $388.7 billion (2008: $440.6 billion), a decrease of 11.8%. Average long-term AUM, which generally earn higher fee rates than institutional money market AUM, for the year ended December 31, 2009, were $301.7 billion, a decrease of 16.4% from $360.8 billion for the year ended December 31, 2008, while average institutional money market AUM increased 9.0% to $87.0 billion at December 31, 2009, from $79.8 billion for the year ended December 31, 2008. Service and Distribution Fees Service fees are generated through fees charged to cover several types of expenses, including fund accounting fees and other maintenance costs for mutual funds, unit trusts and ICVCs, and administrative fees earned from closed-ended funds. Service fees also include transfer agent fees, which are fees charged to cover the expense of processing client share purchases and redemptions, call center support and client reporting. U.S. distribution fees can include 12b-1 fees earned from certain mutual funds to cover allowable sales and marketing expenses for those funds and also include asset-based sales charges paid by certain mutual funds for a period of time after the sale of those funds. Distribution fees typically vary in relation to the amount of client assets managed. Generally, retail products offered outside of the U.S. do not generate a separate distribution fee, as the quoted management fee rate is inclusive of these services. In 2009, service and distribution fees decreased 19.5% to $412.6 million (2008: $512.5 million) primarily due to decreases in average AUM during the year. Included in the decline in service and distribution fees in the three months ended December 31, 2009, was a reduction of $5.4 million reflecting the full-year impact of a reduction in transfer agency and administrative revenues in Canada, as certain fund expense recovery limits were reached. Performance Fees Performance fee revenues are generated on certain management contracts when performance hurdles are achieved. Such fee revenues are recorded in operating revenues as of the performance measurement date, when the contractual performance criteria have been met and when the outcome of the transaction can be measured reliably in accordance with Method 1 of ASC Topic 605-20-S99, Revenue Recognition Services SEC Materials. Cash receipt of earned performance fees occurs after the measurement date. The performance measurement date is defined in each contract in which incentive and performance fee revenue agreements are in effect, and therefore we have performance fee arrangements that include monthly, quarterly and annual measurement dates. Given the uniqueness of each transaction, performance fee contracts are evaluated on an individual basis to determine if revenues can and should be recognized. Performance fees are not recorded if there are any future performance contingencies. If performance 32 Table of Contents arrangements require repayment of the performance fee for failure to perform during the contractual period, then performance fee revenues are recognized no earlier than the expiration date of these terms. Performance fees will fluctuate from period to period and may not correlate with general market changes, since most of the fees are driven by relative performance to the respective benchmark rather than by absolute performance. Additionally, of our $423.1 billion in AUM at December 31, 2009, only approximately $30.0 billion, or 7.1%, could potentially earn performance fees. In 2009, performance fees decreased 60.1% to $30.0 million (2008: $75.1 million). The performance fees generated in 2009 arose primarily due to products managed by the Invesco Global Strategies group ($2.4 million), Invesco Perpetual ($13.4 million), and Atlantic Trust ($5.7 million). The performance fees generated in 2008 arose primarily due to products managed by the Invesco Global Strategies ($22.3 million) and Real Estate ($14.5 million) groups, as well as by Invesco Perpetual ($21.1 million). Other Revenues Other revenues include fees derived primarily from transaction commissions earned upon the sale of new investments into certain of our funds and fees earned upon the completion of transactions in our direct real estate and private equity asset groups. Real estate transaction fees are derived from commissions earned through the buying and selling of properties. Private equity transaction fees include commissions associated with the restructuring of, and fees from providing advice to, portfolio companies held by the funds. These transaction fees are recorded in our financial statements on the date when the transactions are legally closed. Other revenues also include the revenues of consolidated investment products. In 2009, other revenues decreased 36.9% to $64.5 million (2008: $102.2 million), driven by decreases in transaction commissions, due to the tightening of the credit markets and fewer real estate transactions, and foreign exchange rate movements. Third-Party Distribution, Service and Advisory Expenses Third-party distribution, service and advisory expenses include periodic renewal commissions paid to brokers and independent financial advisors for their continuing oversight of their clients assets, over the time they are invested, and are payments for the servicing of client accounts. Renewal commissions are calculated based upon a percentage of the AUM value. Third-party distribution expenses also include the amortization of upfront commissions paid to broker-dealers for sales of fund shares with a contingent deferred sales charge (a charge levied to the investor for client redemption of AUM within a certain contracted period of time). The distribution commissions are amortized over the redemption period. Also included in third-party distribution, service and advisory expenses are sub-transfer agency fees that are paid to third parties for processing client share purchases and redemptions, call center support and client reporting. Third-party distribution, service and advisory expenses may increase or decrease at a rate different from the rate of change in service and distribution fee revenues due to the inclusion of distribution, service and advisory expenses for the U.K. and Canada, where the related revenues are recorded as investment management fee revenues, as noted above. Third-party distribution, service and advisory expenses decreased 20.8% in 2009 to $693.4 million (2008: $875.5 million), consistent with the declines in investment management and service and distribution fee revenues. Proportional share of revenues, net of third-party distribution expenses, from joint venture investments Management believes that the addition of our proportional share of revenues, net of third-party distribution expenses, from joint venture arrangements should be added to operating revenues to arrive at net revenues, as it is important to evaluate the contribution to the business that our joint venture arrangements are making. See Schedule of Non-GAAP Information for additional disclosures regarding the use of net revenues. The company most significant joint venture arrangement is our 49.0% investment in Invesco Great Wall Fund Management Company Limited (the Invesco Great Wall joint venture). The 21.8% decrease in our proportional share of revenues, net of third-party distribution expenses, to $44.8 million in 2009 (2008: $57.3 million), is driven by the declines in average AUM of the Invesco Great Wall joint venture. Our share of the Invesco Great Wall joint venture average AUM at December 31, 2009, was $3.7 billion, a 17.8% decline in average AUM from $4.5 billion at December 31, 2008. 33 Table of Contents Operating Expenses During 2009, operating expenses decreased 16.3% to $2,143.0 million (2008: $2,559.8 million), reflecting declines in all cost categories from 2008 expense levels. As discussed above, a significant portion of our business and managed AUM are based outside of the U.S. The income statements of foreign currency subsidiaries are translated into U.S. dollars, the reporting currency of the company, using average foreign exchange rates. Over the course of the year, the average U.S. dollar foreign exchange rate was stronger when compared to other currencies, primarily the Pound Sterling, Canadian dollar and Euro, which impacted our reported expenses for the year ended December 31, 2009, as compared to the year ended December 31, 2008. The impact of foreign exchange rate movements resulted in $108.0 million (25.9%) of the decline in operating expenses during the year ended December 31, 2009. Additionally, operating expenses were lower in 2009 as compared to 2008 reflecting the impact of general cost containment measures and costs that move in line with revenues. The main categories of operating expenses are as follows: $ in millions 2009 2008 $ Change % Change Employee compensation 950.8 1,055.8 (105.0 ) (9.9 )% Third-party distribution, service and advisory 693.4 875.5 (182.1 ) (20.8 )% Marketing 108.9 148.2 (39.3 ) (26.5 )% Property, office and technology 212.3 214.3 (2.0 ) (0.9 )% General and administrative 166.8 266.0 (99.2 ) (37.3 )% Transaction and integration 10.8 10.8 N/A Total operating expenses 2,143.0 2,559.8 (416.8 ) (16.3 )% The table below sets forth these expense categories as a percentage of total operating expenses and operating revenues, which we believe provides useful information as to the relative significance of each type of expense. % of Total % of % of Total % of Operating Operating Operating Operating $ in millions 2009 Expenses Revenues 2008 Expenses Revenues Employee compensation 950.8 44.4 % 36.2 % 1,055.8 41.2 % 31.9 % Third-party distribution, service and advisory 693.4 32.3 % 26.4 % 875.5 34.2 % 26.5 % Marketing 108.9 5.1 % 4.1 % 148.2 5.8 % 4.5 % Property, office and technology 212.3 9.9 % 8.1 % 214.3 8.4 % 6.5 % General and administrative 166.8 7.8 % 6.3 % 266.0 10.4 % 8.0 % Transaction and integration 10.8 0.5 % 0.4 % Total operating expenses 2,143.0 100.0 % 81.5 % 2,559.8 100.0 % 77.4 % Employee Compensation Employee compensation includes salary, cash bonuses and share-based payment plans designed to attract and retain the highest caliber employees. Employee staff benefit plan costs and payroll taxes are also included in employee compensation. Employee compensation decreased $105.0 million, or 9.9%, in 2009 from 2008 due predominantly to overall decreases in variable compensation, including decreases in discretionary and investment performance-based staff bonuses, decreases in base salary costs resulting from decreases in headcount, and foreign exchange rate movements. Headcount declined 8.2% to 4,890 at December 31, 2009 from 5,325 at December 31, 2008. Included in compensation expenses during the year ended December 31, 2009, are share-based payment costs of $90.8 million, compared to $97.7 million during the year ended December 31, 2008. Additionally, employee compensation costs for the years ended December 31, 2009 and 2008, included $20.0 million of prepaid compensation amortization expenses related to the 2006 acquisition of W.L. Ross & Co. This expense amortization will continue through 2010, and the acquisition-related asset will be fully amortized by the third quarter of 2011. Compensation expenses in the three months ended December 31, 2009, included a $4.1 million increase in pension costs related to the plans actuarial annual valuation updates and a $4.3 million increase in payroll taxes associated with the vesting of share-based payment awards. 34 Table of Contents Third-Party Distribution, Service and Advisory Expenses Third-party distribution, service and advisory expenses are discussed above in the operating and net revenues section. Marketing Marketing expenses include marketing support payments, which are payments made to distributors of certain of our retail products over and above the 12b-1 distribution payments. These fees are contracted separately with each distributor. Marketing expenses also include the cost of direct advertising of our products through trade publications, television and other media, and public relations costs, such as the marketing of the company products through conferences or other sponsorships, and the cost of marketing-related employee travel. Marketing expenses decreased 26.5% in 2009 to $108.9 million (2008: $148.2 million) due to decreased marketing support payments related to the decline in average AUM in the U.S., a lower level of advertising, and a reduction in marketing-related travel costs. Property, Office and Technology Property, office and technology expenses include rent and utilities for our various leased facilities, depreciation of company-owned property and capitalized computer equipment costs, minor non-capitalized computer equipment and software purchases and related maintenance payments, and costs related to externally provided operations, technology, and other back office management services. Property, office and technology costs decreased 0.9% to $212.3 million in 2009 from $214.3 million in 2008. Decreases in technology costs resulting from general disciplined expense management measures and foreign exchange rate movement were offset by increases in property and office costs during the year. Property and office expenses for the year ended December 31, 2009, included $12.0 million in charges relating to vacating leased property, including our Denver, Colorado, operations facility. Property and office expenses during 2008 included a $5.1 million rent charge related to vacating leased property, offset by downward adjustments in rent costs for sublet office property of $8.2 million. Property, office and technology costs increased in the three months ended December 31, 2009, primarily due to the outsourcing of facilities management in North America and the significant growth of the Hyderabad, India, facility. General and Administrative General and administrative expenses include professional services costs, such as information service subscriptions, consulting fees, professional insurance costs, audit, tax and legal fees, non-marketing related employee travel expenditures, recruitment and training costs, and the amortization of certain intangible assets. General and administrative expenses decreased by $99.2 million (37.3%) to $166.8 million in 2009 from $266.0 million in 2008, due to several factors including an insurance recovery of $9.5 million related to legal costs associated with the market-timing regulatory settlement, foreign exchange rate movement, and general disciplined expense management measures, including reduced travel and entertainment and professional services expenses recorded during the year ended December 31, 2009. Transaction and integration Transaction and integration expenses include acquisition-related charges incurred during the period to effect a business combination, including legal, regulatory, advisory, valuation, and other professional or consulting fees, general and administrative costs, including travel costs related to the transaction and the costs of temporary staff involved in executing the transaction, and post-closing costs of integrating the acquired business into the company existing operations. Transaction and integration charges were $10.8 million in 2009 ($9.8 million of these costs were recorded in the three months ended December 31, 2009) and relate to the pending acquisition of Morgan Stanley retail asset management business, including Van Kampen Investments. The acquisition was announced in October 2009 and is expected to close in mid-2010. These costs are currently estimated to be less than $175 million, including those costs incurred in 2009, and are expected to continue to be incurred during 2010-2011. At the time of the announcement of the transaction, the transaction and integration costs were estimated to be approximately $125 million. One of the largest anticipated post-closing expenses of integrating the acquired business into the company existing operations relates to the costs of proxy solicitation of fund shareholders. Our estimates of these charges could continue to increase as additional resources are devoted to obtaining the required votes as early as practicable before the end of the second quarter of 2010, as desired. 35 Table of Contents Operating Income, Net Operating Income, Operating Margin and Net Operating Margin Operating income decreased 35.2% to $484.3 million in 2009 from $747.8 million in 2008, driven by the declines in operating revenues from reduced AUM. As a result of the decline in our operating revenues, the following measures have also declined in 2009: operating margin, net operating income, and net operating margin. Operating margin (operating income divided by operating revenues) was 18.4% in 2009, down from 22.6% in 2008. Net operating income (operating income plus our proportional share of the operating income from joint venture arrangements) decreased 34.9% to $512.7 million in 2009 from $787.5 million in 2008. Net operating margin was 25.9% in 2009, down from 31.6% in 2008. Net operating margin is equal to net operating income divided by net revenues. Net revenues are equal to operating revenues less third-party distribution, service and advisory expenses, plus our proportional share of the net revenues from our joint venture arrangements. See Schedule of Non-GAAP Information for a reconciliation of operating revenues to net revenues, a reconciliation of operating income to net operating income and additional important disclosures regarding net revenues, net operating income and net operating margins. Other Income and Expenses Equity in earnings of unconsolidated affiliates decreased by $19.8 million (42.3%) to $27.0 million in the year ended December 31, 2009 (December 31, 2008: $46.8 million), resulting primarily from declines in our share of the pre-tax earnings of our joint venture investments in China as well as net losses in certain of our partnership investments. Interest income decreased 73.7% to $9.8 million in 2009 from $37.2 million in 2008 due to the combination of lower interest rates and lower average cash and cash equivalents balances in 2009. The decrease in yields was consistent with the market movement from 2008 to 2009. Interest expense decreased 16.1% to $64.5 million in 2009 from $76.9 million in 2008 due to decreases in the average debt balance in 2009. Other gains and losses, net were a net gain of $7.8 million in 2009, compared to a net loss of $39.9 million in 2008. Included in the net gain is a gross gain generated upon the debt tender offer of $4.3 million ($3.3 million net of related expenses) and net gain of $4.3 million realized upon the disposal of other investments (2008: $7.4 million gain on maturity of a CLO investment, offset by a loss of $4.1 million realized upon the disposal of a private equity investment). The 2009 net gain also included $5.2 million in other-than-temporary impairment charges related to the valuations of investments in certain of our CLO products (2008: $22.7 million) and $3.0 million in other-than-temporary impairment charges related to other seed money in affiliated funds (2008: $8.5 million). The CLO impairments arose principally from adverse changes in the timing of estimated cash flows used in the valuation models. In the year ended December 31, 2009, we also benefited from $8.4 million in net foreign exchange gains whereas in 2008, we incurred $13.0 million in net foreign exchange losses. See Item 8, Financial Statements and Supplementary Data Note 13, Other Gains and Losses, Net, for additional details related to other gains and losses. Included in other income and expenses are net realized and unrealized gains of consolidated investment products. In 2009, the net losses of consolidated investment products were $106.9 million, compared to net losses of $58.0 million in 2008, reflecting the changes in market values of the investments held by consolidated investment products. Invesco invests in only a small equity portion of these products, and as a result these losses are offset by noncontrolling interests of $113.9 million, resulting in a net impact to the company of $7.0 million. Income Tax Expense Our subsidiaries operate in several taxing jurisdictions around the world, each with its own statutory income tax rate. As a result, our effective tax rate will vary from year to year depending on the mix of the profits and losses of our subsidiaries. The majority of our profits are earned in the U.S., Canada and the U.K. The current U.K. statutory tax rate is 28%, the Canadian statutory tax rate is 33% and the U.S. Federal statutory tax rate is 35%. Our effective tax rate, excluding noncontrolling interests in consolidated entities, for 2009 was 31.5%, down from 32.9% for 2008. The rate decrease was primarily due to the mix of pre-tax income and a larger benefit from the release of provisions for uncertain tax positions in 2009 versus 2008. The rate decrease was partially offset by an increase in the net valuation allowance for subsidiary operating losses and additional state taxes. The inclusion of income from noncontrolling interests in consolidated entities increased our effective tax rate to 41.5% in 2009 and to 35.9% in 2008. 36 Table of Contents Results of Operations for the Year Ended December 31, 2008, Compared with the Year Ended December 31, 2007 Operating Revenues and Net Revenues Operating revenues decreased by 14.7% in 2008 to $3,307.6 million (2007: $3,878.9 million). Net revenues are operating revenues less third-party distribution, service and advisory expenses, plus our proportional share of net revenues from joint venture arrangements. Net revenues decreased by 13.8% in 2008 to $2,489.4 million (2007: $2,888.4 million). See Schedule of Non-GAAP Information for additional important disclosures regarding the use of net revenues. The main categories of revenues, and the dollar and percentage change between the periods, are as follows: $ in millions 2008 2007 $ Change % Change Investment management fees 2,617.8 3,080.1 (462.3 ) (15.0 )% Service and distribution fees 512.5 593.1 (80.6 ) (13.6 )% Performance fees 75.1 70.3 4.8 6.8 % Other 102.2 135.4 (33.2 ) (24.5 )% Total operating revenues 3,307.6 3,878.9 (571.3 ) (14.7 )% Third-party distribution, service and advisory expenses (875.5 ) (1,051.1 ) 175.6 (16.7 )% Proportional share of revenues, net of third-party distribution expenses, from joint venture investments 57.3 60.6 (3.3 ) (5.4 )% Net revenues 2,489.4 2,888.4 (399.0 ) (13.8 )% Investment Management Fees Investment management fees decreased 15.0% in 2008 to $2,617.8 million (2007: $3,080.1 million) due to decreases in average AUM during the year and the mix of AUM between various asset classes. Average AUM for the year ended December 31, 2008, were $440.6 billion (2007: $489.1 billion), a decrease of 9.9%. Average long-term AUM, which generally earn higher fee rates than institutional money market AUM, for the year ended December 31, 2008, were $360.8 billion, a decrease of 14.9% from $424.2 billion for the year ended December 31, 2007, while average institutional money market AUM increased 23.0% to $79.8 billion at December 31, 2008, from $64.9 billion for the year ended December 31, 2007. In addition, our equity AUM as a percentage of total AUM fell from 49% at December 31, 2007, to 36% at December 31, 2008. This decline in equities within our asset mix was consistent with the decline in global equity markets. Performance Fees In 2008, these fees increased 6.8% to $75.1 million (2007: $70.3 million). The performance fees generated in 2008 arose primarily in the Invesco Quantitative Strategies and Real Estate groups, as well as in the U.K.; whereas the performance fees generated in 2007 included amounts generated primarily in the U.K. and Asia. Service and Distribution Fees In 2008, service and distribution fees decreased 13.6% to $512.5 million (2007: $593.1 million) primarily due to decreased retail AUM, offset by increases in institutional money market revenues resulting from the 23.0% increase in average institutional money market AUM during the year. Other Revenues In 2008, other revenues decreased 24.5% to $102.2 million (2007: $135.4 million) driven by decreases in sales volumes of funds subject to front-end commissions, offset by higher transaction fees within our private equity business. Third-Party Distribution, Service and Advisory Expenses Third-party distribution, service and advisory expenses decreased 16.7% in 2008 to $875.5 million (2007: $1,051.1 million), consistent with the declines in investment management and service and distribution fee revenues. 37 Table of Contents Proportional share of revenues, net of third-party distribution expenses, from joint venture investments The 5.4% decrease in our proportional share of revenues, net of third-party distribution expenses, to $57.3 million in 2008 (2007: $60.6 million), is driven by the declines in average AUM in the Invesco Great Wall joint venture. Our share of the Invesco Great Wall joint venture AUM at December 31, 2008, was $3.0 billion, a 58% decline in AUM from $7.1 billion at December 31, 2007, reflecting the increased volatility of equity markets in this region during the year. Operating Expenses During 2008, operating expenses decreased 11.3% to $2,559.8 million (2007: $2,884.6 million), reflecting declines in all cost categories from 2007 expense levels. The main categories of operating expenses are as follows: $ in millions 2008 2007 $ Change % Change Employee compensation 1,055.8 1,137.6 (81.8 ) (7.2 )% Third-party distribution, service and advisory 875.5 1,051.1 (175.6 ) (16.7 )% Marketing 148.2 157.6 (9.4 ) (6.0 )% Property, office and technology 214.3 242.5 (28.2 ) (11.6 )% General and administrative 266.0 295.8 (29.8 ) (10.1 )% Total operating expenses 2,559.8 2,884.6 (324.8 ) (11.3 )% The table below sets forth these expense categories as a percentage of total operating expenses and operating revenues, which we believe provides useful information as to the relative significance of each type of expense. % of Total % of % of Total % of Operating Operating Operating Operating $ in millions 2008 Expenses Revenues 2007 Expenses Revenues Employee compensation 1,055.8 41.2 % 31.9 % 1,137.6 39.4 % 29.3 % Third-party distribution, service and advisory 875.5 34.2 % 26.5 % 1,051.1 36.4 % 27.1 % Marketing 148.2 5.8 % 4.5 % 157.6 5.5 % 4.1 % Property, office and technology 214.3 8.4 % 6.5 % 242.5 8.4 % 6.3 % General and administrative 266.0 10.4 % 8.0 % 295.8 10.3 % 7.6 % Total operating expenses 2,559.8 100.0 % 77.4 % 2,884.6 100.0 % 74.4 % Employee Compensation Employee compensation decreased $81.8 million, or 7.2%, in 2008 from 2007 due predominantly to overall decreases in sales commissions and variable compensation. Offsetting these declines were increases in base salary expenses resulting from annual merit increases, which were effective March 1, 2008. Additionally, in the three months ended December 31, 2008, the company experienced increases in bonus expense tied to improved investment performance and performance fee revenues. These increases in bonus expense during the three months ended December 31, 2008, which incorporated recognition of a full year impact tied to investment performance improvements, were equally offset in the three months ended December 31, 2008, by the reversal of $18.8 million ($12.6 million, net of tax, or $0.5 per share) of cumulative share-based compensation charges related to performance-based share awards granted in 2007. The reversal was made because the company does not expect that the required performance targets for the vesting of these awards will be achieved. Of the charges reversed, $10.8 million was originally recorded in 2007, with the remainder originally recorded in the first nine months of 2008. Third-Party Distribution, Service and Advisory Expenses Third-party distribution, service and advisory expenses are discussed above in the operating and net revenues section. Marketing Marketing expenses decreased 6.0% in 2008 to $148.2 million (2007: $157.6 million) due to decreased marketing support payments related to decreased sales and AUM in the U.S., consistent with overall market declines during the period. 38 Table of Contents Property, Office and Technology Property, office and technology costs decreased 11.6% to $214.3 million in 2008 from $242.5 million in 2007, due primarily to reduced depreciation charges reflecting longer useful lives for certain global technology initiatives. During the three months ended December 31, 2008, charges of $5.1 million were recorded related to vacating leased property; however these charges were offset during the year by downward adjustments in rent costs for sublet office property of $8.2 million. Rent expense during the year ended December 31, 2007, included a $7.4 million charge related to vacating leased property. General and Administrative General and administrative expenses decreased by $29.8 million (10.1%) to $266.0 million in 2008 from $295.8 million in 2007. During the three months ended December 31, 2007, we recorded $12.8 million of expense related to the relisting of the company on the New York Stock Exchange and a $9.8 million charge related to the proposed final settlement of market-timing private litigation that commenced in 2003. Operating Income, Net Operating Income, Operating Margin and Net Operating Margin Operating income decreased 24.8% to $747.8 million in 2008 from $994.3 million in 2007, driven by the declines in operating revenues from reduced AUM. Operating margin (operating income divided by operating revenues) was 22.6% in 2008, down from 25.6% in 2007. Net operating income (operating income plus our proportional share of the operating income from joint venture arrangements) decreased 24.3% to $787.5 million in 2008 from $1,039.8 million in 2007. Net operating margin is equal to net operating income divided by net revenues. Net revenues are equal to operating revenues less third-party distribution, service and advisory expenses, plus our proportional share of the net revenues from our joint venture arrangements. Net operating margin was 31.6% in 2008, down from 36.0% in 2007. See Schedule of Non-GAAP Information for a reconciliation of operating revenues to net revenues, a reconciliation of operating income to net operating income and additional important disclosures regarding net revenues, net operating income and net operating margins. Other Income and Expenses Equity in earnings of unconsolidated affiliates decreased by $1.3 million (2.7%) to $46.8 million in the year ended December 31, 2008 (December 31, 2007: $48.1 million), resulting primarily from declines in our share of the pre-tax losses of our partnership investments. Interest income decreased 23.3% to $37.2 million in 2008 from $48.5 million in 2007 due to the combination of lower interest rates and lower average cash and cash equivalents balances in 2008. The decrease in yields was consistent with the market movement from 2007 to 2008. Interest expense increased 7.9% to $76.9 million in 2008 from $71.3 million in 2007 due to increases in the average debt balance in 2008, which were only partially offset by lower debt costs in 2008. Other gains and losses, net were a net loss of $39.9 million in 2008, compared to a net gain of $9.9 million in 2007. The 2008 net loss included $22.7 million in other-than-temporary impairment charges related to the valuations of investments in certain of our CLO products (2007: $5.4 million) and $8.5 million in other-than-temporary impairment charges related to other seed money in affiliated funds (2007: $0 million). The impairment of the CLO products arose principally from increases in discount rates and extended cash flow projections used in the valuation models, and the impairment of the seed money arose principally due to extended declines in market values of the underlying funds. $14.2 million of the combined impairment charges arose during the three months ended December 31, 2008. Included in other gains and losses, net are net gains on disposals of investments of $4.3 million in 2008 (2007: $24.0 million), primarily driven by a gain of $7.4 realized upon the maturity of a CLO product in which the company had invested. Also included in other losses are net foreign exchange losses, primarily associated with long-term intercompany financing. In the year ended December 31, 2008, we incurred $13.0 million in net foreign exchange losses (2007: $10.3 million), largely the result of the weakening of the Pound Sterling to the Euro and U.S. dollar in the three months ended December 31, 2008. See Item 8, Financial Statements and Supplementary Data Note 13, Other Gains and Losses, Net, for additional details related to other gains and losses. Included in other income and expenses are net realized and unrealized gains of consolidated investment products. In 2008, the net losses of consolidated investment products were $58.0 million, compared to net gains of $214.3 million in 2007, reflecting the changes in market values of the investments held by consolidated investment products and the deconsolidation of certain variable 39 Table of Contents interest entities for which we determined that we were no longer the primary beneficiary. Invesco invests in a small equity portion of these products, and as a result the majority of these gains and losses are offset by noncontrolling interests. Income Tax Expense The 2008 U.K. statutory tax rate was 28.0%, the Canadian statutory tax rate was 33.5% and the U.S. Federal statutory tax rate was 35.0%. The U.K. tax rate decreased from 30% to 28.0% effective April 1, 2008. On December 14, 2007, legislation was enacted to reduce the Canadian income tax rate over five years, which changed the tax rate to 33.5% in 2008 and 33.0% in 2009. The legislation was revised in December 2009, further reducing the rate to 31.0% in 2010, 28.25% in 2011 and 26.25% in 2012. Our effective tax rate excluding noncontrolling interests in consolidated entities for 2008 was 32.9%, as compared to 34.6% in 2007. The decrease related primarily to a net reduction in our reserves, lower state taxes, and reduced taxes on subsidiary dividends in excess of an increase in the net valuation allowance for subsidiary operating losses and certain investment write-downs that did not give rise to tax benefits. Our effective tax rate, after noncontrolling interests, increased to 52.9% for the three months ended December 31, 2008, largely as a result of the investment write-downs. 2007 included a reduction in our Canadian and U.K. deferred tax assets to reflect the tax rate changes discussed above and transaction costs associated with our change in listing and domicile that were not deductible for tax purposes. The inclusion of income from noncontrolling interests increased our effective tax rate to 35.9% in 2008 and reduced it to 28.7% in 2007. Schedule of Non-GAAP Information Net revenues (and by calculation, net revenue yield on AUM), net operating income and net operating margin are non-GAAP financial measures. The most comparable U.S. GAAP measures are operating revenues (and by calculation, gross revenue yield on AUM), operating income and operating margin. Management believes that the exclusion of third-party distribution, service and advisory expenses from operating revenues in the computation of net revenues and the related computation of net operating margin provides useful information to investors because the distribution, service and advisory fee amounts represent costs that are passed through to external parties who perform functions on behalf of the company managed funds, which essentially are a share of the related revenues. These expenses vary by geography due to the differences in distribution channels. The net presentation assists in identifying the revenue contribution generated by the business, removing the distortions caused by the differing distribution channel fees and assisting in comparison with U.S. peer investment managers. Third-party distribution, service and advisory expenses include renewal commissions paid to independent financial advisors for as long as the clients assets are invested and are payments for the servicing of client accounts. Renewal commissions are calculated based upon a percentage of the AUM value. Third party distribution expenses also include the amortization of upfront commissions paid to broker-dealers for sales of fund shares with a contingent deferred sales charge (a charge levied to the investor for client redemption of AUM within a certain contracted period of time). The distribution commissions are amortized over the redemption period. Also included in third-party distribution, service and advisory expenses are sub-transfer agency fees that are paid to third parties for processing client share purchases and redemptions, call center support and client reporting. Since the company has been deemed to be the principal in the third-party arrangements, the company must reflect these expenses gross of operating revenues under U.S. GAAP. We believe that it is useful information to investors to show these expenses net of operating revenues, because net presentation more appropriately reflects the nature of these expenses as revenue-sharing activities. Additionally, management evaluates net revenue yield on AUM, which is equal to net revenues divided by average AUM during the reporting period. This metric is an indicator of the basis point net revenues we receive for each dollar of AUM we manage and is useful when evaluating the company performance relative to industry competitors. Management also believes that the addition of our proportional share of revenues, net of distribution expenses, from joint venture investments in the computation of net revenues and the addition of our proportional share of operating income in the related computations of net operating income and net operating margin also provide useful information to investors, as management considers it appropriate to evaluate the contribution of its joint venture to the operations of the business. The company has two joint venture investments in China. The Invesco Great Wall joint venture was one of the largest Sino-foreign managers of equity products in China, with ending AUM of approximately $8 billion as of December 31, 2009. Enhancing our operations in China is one effort that we believe could improve our competitive position over time. Accordingly, we believe that it is appropriate to evaluate the contribution of our joint venture investments to the operations of the business. 40 Table of Contents Net revenues (and by calculation net revenue yield on AUM), net operating income, and net operating margin should not be considered as substitutes for any measures derived in accordance with U.S. GAAP and may not be comparable to other similarly titled measures of other companies. The company will be expanding its use of non-GAAP measures in future filings, beginning with the Form 10-Q for the three months ended March 31, 2010, to include reconciling items relating to FASB Statement No. 167 (discussed in Part I, Item 1A, Risk Factors, and in Item 8, Financial Statements and Supplementary Data Note 1, Accounting Policies ) and the acquisition of Morgan Stanley retail asset management business. The following is a reconciliation of operating revenues, operating income and operating margin on a U.S. GAAP basis to net revenues, net operating income and net operating margin.

Balance Sheet Discussion The following table presents a comparative analysis of significant balance sheet line items: $ in millions 2009 2008 $ Change % Change Cash and cash equivalents 762.0 585.2 176.8 30.2 % Unsettled fund receivables 383.1 303.7 79.4 26.1 % Current investments 182.4 123.6 58.8 47.6 % Assets held for policyholders 1,283.0 840.2 442.8 52.7 % Non-current investments 157.4 121.3 36.1 29.8 % Investments of consolidated investment products 685.0 843.8 (158.8 ) (18.8 )% Goodwill 6,467.6 5,966.8 500.8 8.4 % Policyholder payables 1,283.0 840.2 442.8 52.7 % Current maturities of total debt 297.2 (297.2 ) (100.0 )% Long-term debt 745.7 862.0 (116.3 ) (13.5 )% Equity attributable to common shareholders 6,912.9 5,689.5 1,223.4 21.5 % Equity attributable to noncontrolling interests in consolidated entities 707.9 906.7 (198.8 ) (21.9 )% Cash and cash equivalents Cash and cash equivalents increased from December 31, 2008, to December 31, 2009, primarily due to $441.8 million of cash received from the equity issuance and $362.7 million net cash generated from operating activities, offset by $397.2 million used to retire debt, $168.9 million used to pay the quarterly dividends, and net $43.5 million of investments in seeding new products. Invesco has local capital requirements in several jurisdictions, as well as regional requirements for entities that are part of the European sub-group. These requirements mandate the retention of liquid resources in those jurisdictions, which we meet in part by holding cash and cash equivalents. This retained cash can be used for general business purposes in the European sub-group or in the 41 Table of Contents countries where it is located. Due to the capital restrictions, the ability to transfer cash between certain jurisdictions may be limited. In addition, transfers of cash between international jurisdictions may have adverse tax consequences that may substantially limit such activity. At December 31, 2009, the European sub-group had cash and cash equivalent balances of $333.5 million, much of which is used to satisfy these regulatory requirements. We are in compliance with all regulatory minimum net capital requirements. Unsettled fund receivables Unsettled fund receivables increased from $303.7 million at December 31, 2008, to $383.1 million at December 31, 2009, due to higher transaction activities. Unsettled fund receivables are created by the normal settlement periods on transactions initiated by certain clients of our U.K. and offshore funds. The presentation of the receivable and substantially offsetting payable ($367.9 million) at trade date with both the investor and the fund for normal purchases and sales reflects the legal relationship between the underlying investor and the company. Investments (current and non-current) As of December 31, 2009, we had $339.8 million in investments; of which $182.4 million were current investments and $157.4 million were non-current investments. Included in current investments are $74.8 million of seed money investments in affiliated funds used to seed funds as we launch new products, and $84.6 million of investments related to assets held for deferred compensation plans. These investments are also held primarily in affiliated funds and increased significantly from December 31, 2008, due to new investments purchased to economically hedge new deferred compensation liabilities that arose from both the modification of certain share-based awards during the period (discussed in Item 8, Financial Statements and Supplementary Data Note 17, Share-Based Compensation ) and the establishment of a new deferred compensation plan for certain employees of the company. Included in non-current investments are $134.7 million in equity method investments in our Chinese joint ventures and in certain of the company private equity, real estate and other investments. Equity method investments increased by $39.4 million from the prior year balance, the increase including a $30.0 million new investment in Invesco Mortgage Capital, Inc. (IVR, discussed in Item 8, Financial Statements and Supplementary Data Note 16, Consolidated Investment Products ). Additionally, non-current investments include $17.9 million of investments in collateralized loan obligation structures managed by Invesco. Our investments in collateralized loan obligation structures are generally in the form of a relatively small portion of the unrated, junior subordinated position. As such, these positions would share in the first losses to be incurred if the structures were to experience significant increases in default rates of underlying investments above historical levels. Assets held for policyholders and policyholder payables One of our subsidiaries, Invesco Perpetual Life Limited, is an insurance company that was established to facilitate retirement savings plans in the U.K. The entity holds assets that are managed for its clients on its balance sheet with an equal and offsetting liability. The increasing balance in these accounts from $840.2 million at December 31, 2008, to $1,283.0 million at December 31, 2009, was the result of foreign exchange movements, the increase in the market values of these assets, and net flows into the funds. Investments of consolidated investment products The primary beneficiary of variable interest entities (VIEs) is required to consolidate the VIEs. A VIE is an entity that does not have sufficient equity to finance its operations without additional subordinated financial support, or an entity for which the risks and rewards of ownership are not directly linked to voting interests. Generally, limited partnership entities where the general partner does not have substantive equity investment at risk and where the other limited partners do not have substantive (greater than 50%) rights to remove the general partner or to dissolve the limited partnership are also VIEs. The primary beneficiary is the party to the VIE who absorbs a majority of the losses or absorbs the majority of the rewards generated by the VIE. Additionally, under the voting interest entity (VOE) consolidation model, the general partner in a partnership that is not a VIE consolidates the partnership because the general partner is deemed to control the partnership where the other limited partners do not have substantive kick-out, liquidation or participation rights. Investments of consolidated investment products include the investments of both consolidated VIEs and VOEs. As of December 31, 2009, investments of consolidated investment products totaled $685.0 million (December 31, 2008: $843.8 million). These investments are offset primarily in noncontrolling interests in consolidated entities on the Consolidated Balance Sheets, as the company equity investment in these structures is very small. The decrease from December 31, 2008, reflects the impact of declining market values and the deconsolidation during the period ended December 31, 2009, of $53.3 million of investments held by consolidated investment products and related noncontrolling interests in consolidated entities, as a result of determining that the company is no longer the primary beneficiary. 42 Table of Contents Goodwill Goodwill increased from $5,966.8 million at December 31, 2008, to $6,467.6 million at December 31, 2009, primarily due to the impact of foreign currency translation for certain subsidiaries whose functional currency differs from that of the parent. The foreign exchange rates at the end of 2009, used to translate the balance sheets of foreign currency subsidiaries into U.S. dollars, the reporting currency of the company, reflect a weaker U.S. dollar at the end of 2009, mainly against the Canadian dollar and Pound Sterling, which resulted in a $466.6 million increase in goodwill, upon consolidation, with a corresponding increase in equity. Additional goodwill was recorded in 2009 related to the earn-out on the W.L. Ross & Co. acquisition ($34.2 million). The company annual goodwill impairment review is performed as of October 1 of each year. As a result of that analysis, the company determined that no impairment existed at that date. Separately, due to deteriorating market conditions, interim impairment tests were performed at October 31, 2008, and March 31, 2009. These interim tests also concluded that no impairment had occurred. As each test concluded that the fair value was above the carrying value, there was no need to progress to the process of separately valuing each class of asset and liability. See Critical Accounting Policies Goodwill for additional details of the company goodwill impairment analysis process. Current portion of total debt This balance decreased from $297.2 million at December 31, 2008 to $0.0 million at December 31, 2009, as a result of the 4.5% senior notes maturing on December 15, 2009, and being repaid from available cash resources. Long-term debt The non-current portion of our total debt decreased from $862.0 million at December 31, 2008, to $745.7 million at December 31, 2009, as $12.0 million borrowings under the floating rate credit facility were repaid and $104.3 million in debt was retired through the tender offer transaction described below in Debt. Noncontrolling interests in consolidated entities Noncontrolling interests in consolidated entities decreased by $198.8 million from $906.7 million at December 31, 2008, to $707.9 million at December 31, 2009, primarily due to $106.9 million of losses recorded by the consolidated investment products during the year and the deconsolidation during the period of $53.3 million of investments held by consolidated investment products and related noncontrolling interests in consolidated entities, as a result of determining that the company was no longer the primary beneficiary. The noncontrolling interests in consolidated entities are generally offset by the net assets of consolidated investment products, as the company equity investment in the investment products is very small. Equity attributable to common shareholders Equity attributable to common shareholders increased from $5,689.5 million at December 31, 2008, to $6,912.9 million at December 31, 2009, an increase of $1,223.4 million. An issuance of new shares raised a net $441.8 million and the changes in foreign currency rates added $488.3 million to equity. Other increases to equity included net income attributable to common shareholders of $322.5 million, share issuances upon employee option exercises of $80.3 million, and the share based payment credit to capital of $90.8 million. The increases to equity were partially offset by $168.9 million in dividend payments, $13.0 million related to the modification of a share-based payment award into a cash-settled award, $22.9 million in shares acquired from employees to meet withholding tax obligations on share award vestings, and a $7.5 million deduction arising on the purchase of the remaining noncontrolling interest in Invesco Real Estate GmbH. Liquidity and Capital Resources On May 26, 2009, we issued 32.9 million common shares in a public offering that produced gross proceeds of $460.5 million ($441.8 million net of related expenses). On June 9, 2009, we replaced our existing $900.0 million credit facility, which was never fully utilized, with a $500.0 million multi-year credit facility, the amount of which was based upon our past and projected working capital needs; however, we are able to increase the new credit facility to $750.0 million, subject to certain conditions. At December 31, 2009, the company had no balance drawn on the credit facility. These two transactions reflected our ability to access the capital markets in a timely manner. On June 30, 2009, we completed a $100.0 million tender offer to purchase publicly traded debt with a 43 Table of Contents principal value of $104.3 million. On December 15, 2009, we repaid the $294.2 million 4.5% senior notes that matured on that date, utilizing existing cash balances, having repurchased $3.0 million of these notes earlier in the year. We believe that our capital structure, together with available cash balances, cash flows generated from operations, existing capacity under our credit facility, proceeds from the public offering of our shares and further capital market activities, if necessary, should provide us with sufficient resources to meet present and future cash needs, including operating, debt and other obligations as they come due and anticipated future capital requirements. Additionally, we expect to use available cash balances and borrowings under our credit facility to satisfy the $500.0 million cash consideration related to acquisition of Morgan Stanley retail asset management business, including Van Kampen Investments. New equity, in the form of common and non-voting common equivalent preferred shares (with economic rights identical to common stock, other than no right to vote such shares) is expected to be issued to Morgan Stanley, without holding restrictions, in conjunction with the close. The ultimate purchase price for the business may be higher or lower than the $1.5 billion announced purchase price, due to contractual price adjustments that will made depending on certain conditions being met at the closing date and changes in the company share price. For example, a price adjustment may be made based on the degree to which clients of the business being acquired provide their consent for the transaction at the time of closing the deal. Our ability to access the capital markets in a timely manner depends on a number of factors including our credit rating, the condition of the global economy, investors willingness to purchase our securities, interest rates, credit spreads and the valuation levels of equity markets. If we are unable to access capital markets in a timely manner, our business could be adversely impacted. Certain of our subsidiaries are required to maintain minimum levels of capital. These and other similar provisions of applicable law may have the effect of limiting withdrawals of capital, repayment of intercompany loans and payment of dividends by such entities. After redomicile and after consultation with the U.K. FSA, it has been determined that, for the purposes of prudential supervision, Invesco Ltd. is not subject to regulatory consolidated capital requirements under current European Union (EU) Directives. A sub-group, however, including all of our regulated EU subsidiaries, is subject to these consolidated capital requirements, and capital is maintained within this sub-group to satisfy these regulations. These requirements mandate the retention of liquid resources in those jurisdictions, which we meet in part by holding cash and cash equivalents. This retained cash can be used for general business purposes in the European sub-group or in the countries where it is located. Due to the capital restrictions, the ability to transfer cash between certain jurisdictions may be limited. In addition, transfers of cash between international jurisdictions may have adverse tax consequences that may substantially limit such activity. At December 31, 2009, the European sub-group had cash and cash equivalent balances of $333.5 million, much of which is used to satisfy these regulatory requirements. We are in compliance with all regulatory minimum net capital requirements. Cash Flows The ability to consistently generate cash from operations in excess of capital expenditures and dividend payments is one of our company fundamental financial strengths. Operations continue to be financed from current earnings and borrowings. Our principal uses of cash, other than for operating expenses, include dividend payments, capital expenditures, acquisitions, purchase of our shares in the open market and investments in certain new investment products. Cash flows of consolidated investment products (discussed in Item 8, Financial Statements and Supplementary Data Note 16, Consolidated Investment Products ) are reflected in Invesco cash provided by operating activities, used in investing activities and used in financing activities. Cash held by consolidated investment products is not available for general use by Invesco, nor is Invesco cash available for general use by its consolidated investment products. Cash flows for the years ended December 31, 2009, 2008 and 2007 are summarized as follows: $ in millions 2009 2008 2007 Net cash (used in)/provided by: Operating activities 362.7 525.5 915.5 Investing activities (102.4 ) (98.4 ) (48.2 ) Financing activities (100.7 ) (666.4 ) (740.8 ) Increase/(decrease) in cash and cash equivalents 159.6 (239.3 ) 126.5 Foreign exchange 17.2 (91.3 ) 10.4 Cash and cash equivalents, beginning of period 585.2 915.8 778.9 Cash and cash equivalents, end of period 762.0 585.2 915.8 44 Table of Contents Operating Activities Net cash provided by operating activities is generated by the receipt of investment management and other fees generated from AUM, offset by operating expenses and changes in operating assets and liabilities. Although some receipts and payments are seasonal, particularly bonus payments, in general our operating cash flows move in the same direction as our operating income. The reduced operating income for the year ended December 31, 2009, when compared to the prior year is a significant factor in the reduced operating cash flows. Cash provided by operating activities in 2009 was $362.7 million, a decrease of $162.8 million or 31% over 2008. Changes in operating assets and liabilities used $118.3 million of cash, while the combined cash generated from other operating items was $481.0 million. The change in operating assets and liabilities was driven by the funding of annual bonuses combined with the lower levels of accrued bonus awards at the end of 2009, together with higher trade receivables at the end of 2009, compared to the end of 2008. The change in operating assets and liabilities also includes a decrease of $45.0 million in the cash held by consolidated investment products. Cash provided by operating activities in 2008 was $525.5 million, a decrease of $390.0 million or 42.6% from 2007. Changes in operating assets and liabilities contributed $273.9 million of the decrease, and lower net income, after adjusting for the gains and losses of consolidated investment products, contributed a further $193.2 million of the decrease in cash flows generated from operating activities. Investing Activities The launch of a number of new products during mid and late 2009 resulted in a net cash outflow into seed and partnership investments of $43.5 million during the year. During year ended December 31, 2009, we recaptured $60.6 million in cash from redemption of prior investments, including seed and partnership investments, and invested $104.1 million in new products. During the fiscal years ended December 31, 2009, 2008 and 2007, our capital expenditures were $39.5 million, $84.1 million and $36.7 million, respectively. Expenditures related principally in each year to technology initiatives, including new platforms from which we maintain our portfolio management systems and fund accounting systems, improvements in computer hardware and software desktop products for employees, new telecommunications products to enhance our internal information flow, and back-up disaster recovery systems. Also, in each year, a portion of these costs related to leasehold improvements made to the various buildings and workspaces used in our offices. These projects have been funded with proceeds from our operating cash flows. Capital expenditures in 2008 also included expenditures related to leasehold improvements in the new headquarters space. During the fiscal years ended December 31, 2009, 2008 and 2007, our capital divestitures were not significant relative to our total fixed assets. Investing activities include the investment purchases and sales of our consolidated investment products. In total, these contributed $8.0 million, $175.6 million and $8.1 million to cash generated in investing activities during the years ended December 31, 2009, 2008, and 2007, respectively. Net cash outflows of $34.2 million in 2009 related to acquisition earn-out payments related to the 2006 acquisition of WL Ross & Co. In 2008, net cash outflows of $130.9 million and $43.4 million related to acquisition earn-out payments for the PowerShares and WL Ross & Co. acquisitions, respectively. Financing Activities Net cash used in financing activities totaled $100.7 million for the year ended December 31, 2009. The equity issuance generated cash proceeds of $441.8 million and proceeds from the exercise of options were $80.0 million. These inflows were offset by the redemption of senior notes of $397.2 million, net repayments of our credit facility of $12.0 million, and the $168.9 million payment of dividends declared in January, April, July and October 2009. Financing cash flows also include a payment of $8.9 million to purchase the remaining 24.9% of Invesco Real Estate GmbH not already held by the company, the controlling interest having been acquired in December 2003. The net cash used in financing activities also includes a net $44.9 million of outflows related to consolidated investment products (2008: $125.3 million; 2007: $27.7 million). Net cash used in financing activities decreased from $740.8 million in 2007 to $666.4 million in 2008, primarily due to lower levels of capital being returned through public stock repurchases of Invesco Ltd. common stock, in form of treasury shares. Cash used for treasury share purchases in 2008 totaled $313.4 million compared to $716.0 million in 2007. 45 Table of Contents Dividends Invesco declares and pays dividends on a quarterly basis in arrears. The 2009 quarterly dividend was $0.1025 per Invesco Ltd. common share. On October 16, 2009, the company declared a third quarter cash dividend, which was paid on December 2, 2009, to shareholders of record as of November 18, 2009. On January 27, 2010, the company declared a fourth quarter cash dividend, which will be paid on March 10, 2010, to shareholders of record as of February 23, 2010. The total dividend attributable to the 2009 fiscal year of $0.41 per share represented a 2.5% increase over the total dividend attributable to the 2008 fiscal year of $0.40 per share. The declaration, payment and amount of any future dividends will be declared by our board of directors and will depend upon, among other factors, our earnings, financial condition and capital requirements at the time such declaration and payment are considered. The board has a policy of managing dividends in a prudent fashion, with due consideration given to profit levels, overall debt levels, and historical dividend payouts. The following table sets forth the historical amounts for quarterly and total dividends per Invesco Ltd. common share attributable to each period indicated. Actual declaration of these dividends occurred in the following fiscal quarter. U.S. Cents per Common Share Years Ended December 31, Q1 Q2 Q3 Q4 Total 2009 10.25 10.25 10.25 10.25 41.0 2008 10.0 10.0 10.0 10.0 40.0 Share Repurchase Plan On April 23, 2008, the board of directors authorized a new share repurchase program of up to $1.5 billion with no stated expiration date. During the year ended December 31, 2009, there were no purchases under this program (December 31, 2008: 5.5 million common shares purchased under this program at a cost of $139.4 million, and 6.1 million shares purchased under the prior share repurchase plan at a cost of $154.5 million), leaving approximately $1.4 billion authorized at the end of the year. Separately, an aggregate of 1.6 million shares were withheld on vesting events during the year ended December 31, 2009, to meet employees tax obligations (December 31, 2008: 0.3 million). The value of these shares withheld was $22.9 million (December 31, 2008: $4.6 million). Debt Our total indebtedness at December 31, 2009, is $745.7 million (December 31, 2008: $1,159.2 million) and is comprised of the following: $ in millions December 31, 2009 December 31, 2008 Unsecured Senior Notes: 4.5% due December 15, 2009 297.2 5.625% due April 17, 2012 215.1 300.0 5.375% due February 27, 2013 333.5 350.0 5.375% due December 15, 2014 197.1 200.0 Floating rate credit facility terminated on June 9, 2009 12.0 Floating rate credit facility expiring June 9, 2012 Total debt 745.7 1,159.2 Less: current maturities of total debt 297.2 Long-term debt 745.7 862.0 For the three months and year ended December 31, 2009, the company weighted average cost of debt was 5.27% and 5.14%, respectively (three months and year ended December 31, 2008: 4.93% and 4.87%, respectively). Total debt decreased from $1,159.2 million at December 31, 2008, to $745.7 million at December 31, 2009, due primarily to repayment of maturing senior notes, borrowings under our floating rate credit facility, and retirement of debt through the tender offer. On June 2, 2009, the company commenced a tender offer for the maximum aggregate principal amount of the outstanding 5.625% senior notes due 2012, the 5.375% senior notes due 2013, and the 5.375% senior notes due 2014 (collectively, the Notes ) that it could purchase for $100.0 million at a purchase price per $1,000 principal amount determined in accordance with the procedures of a 46 Table of Contents modified Dutch Auction (tender offer). The tender offer expired at midnight on June 29, 2009, and on June 30, 2009, $104.3 million of the Notes had been retired, generating a gross gain of $4.3 million upon the retirement of debt at a discount.

The new facility replaces the $900.0 million credit facility that was scheduled to expire on March 31, 2010, but was terminated concurrent with the entry into the new credit facility. Financial covenants under the new credit facility include: (i) the quarterly maintenance of a debt/EBITDA ratio, as defined in the credit agreement, of not greater than 3.25:1.00 through December 31, 2010, and not greater than 3.00:1.00 thereafter, (ii) a coverage ratio (EBITDA, as defined in the credit agreement/interest payable for the four consecutive fiscal quarters ended before the date of determination) of not less than 4.00:1.00, and (iii) maintenance on a monthly basis of consolidated long term assets under management (as defined in the credit agreement) of not less than $194.8 billion, which amount is subject to a one-time reset by the company under certain conditions. As of December 31, 2009, we were in compliance with our debt covenants. At December 31, 2009, our leverage ratio was 1.11:1.00 (December 31, 2008: 1.28:1.00), and our interest coverage ratio was 11.01:1.00 (December 31, 2008: 12.20:1.00), and our long-term AUM were $343.6 billion.

The calculation of EBITDA above (a reconciliation from net income attributable to common shareholders) is defined by our credit agreement, and therefore net income attributable to common shareholders is the most appropriate GAAP measure from which to reconcile to EBITDA. The calculation of adjusted debt is defined in our credit facility and equals total debt of $745.7 million plus $44.4 million in letters of credit and $0.1 million in capital leases. We have received credit ratings of A3 and BBB+ from Moody and Standard & Poor credit rating agencies, respectively, as of the date of this Annual Report on Form 10-K. Standard & Poor has a positive outlook for the rating while Moody has a stable outlook for the rating as of the date of this Annual Report on Form 10-K. According to Moody s, obligations rated A are considered upper medium grade and are subject to low credit risk. Invesco rating of A3 is at the low end of the A range (A1, A2, A3), but three notches above the lowest investment grade rating of Baa3. Standard and Poor rating of BBB+ is at the upper end of the BBB rating, with BBB- representing Standard and Poor lowest investment grade rating. According to Standard and Poor s, BBB obligations exhibit adequate protection parameters; however, adverse economic conditions or changing circumstances are more likely to lead to a weakened capacity of the obligor to meet its financial commitments. We believe that rating agency concerns include but are not limited to: our ability to sustain net positive asset flows across customer channels, product type and geographies, our level of indebtedness, our risk appetite and approach to risk management, our ability to maintain consistent positive investment performance, the profitability of our business under a sustained downturn scenario, and integration risk related to the pending acquisition of Morgan Stanley retail asset management business. Additionally, the rating agencies could decide to downgrade the entire asset management industry, based on their perspective of future growth and solvency. Material deterioration of these factors, and others defined by each rating agency, could result in downgrades to our credit ratings, thereby limiting our ability to generate additional financing. Our credit facility borrowing rates are tied to our credit ratings. However, management believes that solid investment grade ratings are an important factor in winning and maintaining institutional business and strives to manage the company to maintain such ratings. Disclosure of these ratings is not a recommendation to buy, sell or hold our debt. These credit ratings may be subject to revision or withdrawal at anytime by Moody or Standard & Poor s. Each rating should be evaluated independently. The discussion that follows identifies risks associated with the company liquidity and capital resources. The Executive Overview of this Management Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations contains a broader discussion of the company overall approach to risk management. Credit and Liquidity Risk Capital management involves the management of the company liquidity and cash flows. The company manages its capital by reviewing annual and projected cash flow forecasts and by monitoring credit, liquidity and market risks, such as interest rate and foreign currency risks (as discussed in Item 7A, Quantitative and Qualitative Disclosures About Market Risk ), through measurement and analysis. The company is primarily exposed to credit risk through its cash and cash equivalent deposits, which are held by external 48 Table of Contents firms. The company invests its cash balances in its own institutional money market products, as well as with external high credit-quality financial institutions; however, we have chosen to limit the number of firms with which we invest. These arrangements create exposure to concentrations of credit risk. Credit Risk Credit risk is the risk that one party to a financial instrument will cause a financial loss for the other party by failing to discharge an obligation. The company is subject to credit risk in the following areas of its business: All cash and cash equivalent balances are subject to credit risk, as they represent deposits made by the company with external banks and other institutions. As of December 31, 2009, our maximum exposure to credit risk related to our cash and cash equivalent balances is $762.0 million. Cash and cash equivalents invested in affiliated money market funds (related parties) totaled $465.1 million at December 31, 2009. Certain trust subsidiaries of the company accept deposits and place deposits with other institutions on behalf of our customers. As of December 31, 2009, our maximum exposure to credit risk related to these transactions is $0.8 million. The company does not utilize credit derivatives or similar instruments to mitigate the maximum exposure to credit risk. The company does not expect any counterparties to its financial instruments to fail to meet their obligations. Liquidity Risk Liquidity risk is the risk that the company will encounter difficulty in meeting obligations associated with its financial liabilities. The company is exposed to liquidity risk through its $745.7 million in total debt. The company actively manages liquidity risk by preparing cash flow forecasts for future periods, reviewing them regularly with senior management, maintaining a committed credit facility, scheduling significant gaps between major debt maturities and engaging external financing sources in regular dialog. Effects of Inflation Inflation can impact our organization primarily in two ways. First, inflationary pressures can result in increases in our cost structure, especially to the extent that large expense components such as compensation are impacted. To the degree that these expense increases are not recoverable or cannot be counterbalanced through pricing increases due to the competitive environment, our profitability could be negatively impacted. Secondly, the value of the assets that we manage may be negatively impacted when inflationary expectations result in a rising interest rate environment. Declines in the values of these AUM could lead to reduced revenues as management fees are generally calculated based upon the size of AUM. Off Balance Sheet Commitments The company transacts with various private equity, real estate and other investment entities sponsored by the company for the investment of client assets in the normal course of business. Certain of these investments are considered to be variable interest entities of which the company is the primary beneficiary and certain of these investments are limited partnerships for which the company is the general partner and is deemed to have control (with the absence of substantive kick-out, liquidation or participation rights of the other limited partners) and are consolidated into the company financial statements under a voting interest entity model (see Item 8, Financial Statements and Supplementary Data Note 16, Consolidated Investment Products and Note 1, Accounting Policies for additional information on consolidated and unconsolidated investment products). Many of the company investment products are structured as limited partnerships. Our investment may take the form of the general partner or as a limited partner, and the entities are structured such that each partner makes capital commitments that are to be drawn down over the life of the partnership as investment opportunities are identified. At December 31, 2009, our undrawn capital commitments were $77.6 million (2008: $36.5 million). The volatility and valuation dislocations that occurred from 2007 to 2009 in certain sectors of the fixed income market have generated pricing issues in many areas of the market. As a result of these valuation dislocations, during the fourth quarter of 2007, Invesco elected to enter into contingent support agreements for two of its investment trusts to enable them to sustain a stable pricing structure. These two trusts are unregistered trusts that invest in fixed income securities and are available only to accredited investors. In December 2009, the agreements were amended to extend the term through June 30, 2010. As of December 31, 2009, the committed 49 Table of Contents support under these agreements was $51.0 million with an internal approval mechanism to increase the maximum possible support to $66.0 million at the option of the company. The recorded fair value of the guarantees related to these agreements at December 31, 2009, was estimated to be $2.5 million (December 31, 2008: $5.5 million), which was recorded in other current liabilities on the Consolidated Balance Sheets. No payments have been made under either agreement nor has Invesco realized any losses from the support agreements through the date of this Report. These trusts were not consolidated because the company was not deemed to be the primary beneficiary. As of the date of this Report, the committed support under these agreements was $36.0 million. Contractual Obligations We have various financial obligations that require future cash payments. The following table outlines the timing of payment requirements related to our commitments as of December 31, 2009: $ in millions Total (4)(5) Within 1 Year 1-3 Years 3-5 Years More Than 5 Years Total debt 745.7 215.1 530.6 Estimated interest payments on total debt (1) 136.9 40.6 72.7 23.6 Finance leases 0.1 0.1 Operating leases (2) 593.4 61.1 110.7 100.7 320.9 Defined benefit pension and postretirement medical obligations (3) 378.7 8.5 19.4 22.2 328.6 Total 1,854.8 110.3 417.9 677.1 649.5 (1) Total debt includes $745.7 million of fixed rate debt. Fixed interest payments are therefore reflected in the table above in the periods they are due. The credit facility, $500.0 million at December 31, 2009, provides for borrowings of various maturities. Interest is payable based upon LIBOR, Prime, Federal Funds or other bank-provided rates in existence at the time of each borrowing. (2) Operating leases reflect obligations for leased building space and sponsorship and naming rights agreements. See Item 8, Financial Statements and Supplementary Data Note 18, Operating Leases for sublease information. (3) The defined benefit obligation of $378.7 million is comprised of $330.2 million related to pension plans and $48.5 million related to a postretirement medical plan. The fair value of plan assets at December 31, 2009, was $262.9 million for the retirement plan and $7.3 million for the medical plan. See Item 8, Financial Statements and Supplementary Data Note 19, Retirement Benefit Plans for detailed benefit pension and postretirement plan information. (4) Other contingent payments at December 31, 2009, include $500.0 million related to the PowerShares acquisition and $110.0 million related to the WL Ross & Co. acquisition, which are excluded until such time as they are probable and reasonably estimable. (5) Due to the uncertainty with respect to the timing of future cash flows associated with unrecognized tax benefits at December 31, 2009, the company is unable to make reasonably reliable estimates of the period of cash settlement with the respective taxing authorities. Therefore, $39.0 million of gross unrecognized tax benefits have been excluded from the contractual obligations table above. See Item 8, Financial Statements and Supplementary Data, Note 14 Taxation for a discussion on income taxes. 50 Table of Contents Critical Accounting Policies and Estimates Our significant accounting policies are disclosed in Item 8, Financial Statements and Supplementary Data Note 1, Accounting Policies to our Consolidated Financial Statements. The accounting policies and estimates that we believe are the most critical to an understanding of our results of operations and financial condition are those that require complex management judgment regarding matters that are highly uncertain at the time policies were applied and estimates were made. These accounting policies and estimates are discussed below. Different estimates reasonably could have been used in the current period that would have had a material effect on these financial statements, and changes in these estimates are likely to occur from period-to-period in the future. Share-Based Compensation. We have issued equity-settled share-based awards to certain employees, which are measured at fair value at the date of grant. These awards consist of restricted share awards (RSAs), restricted share units (RSUs) and share option awards. Time-vested awards vest ratably over or cliff-vest at the end of a period of continued employee service. Performance-vested awards cliff-vest at the end of a defined vesting period of continued employee service upon the company attainment of certain performance criteria, generally the attainment of cumulative EPS growth targets at the end of the vesting period reflecting a compound annual growth rate of between 10.0% and 15.0% per annum during a three-year period. Time-vested and performance-vested share awards are granted in the form of RSAs or RSUs. Dividends accrue directly to the employee holder of RSAs, and cash payments in lieu of dividends are made to employee holders of certain RSUs. There is therefore no discount to the fair value of these share awards at their grant date. The fair value of these awards is determined at the grant date and is expensed, based on the company estimate of shares that will eventually vest, on a straight-line or accelerated basis over the vesting period. The forfeiture rate applied to most grants is 5% per annum, based upon our historical experience with respect to employee turnover. Fair value for RSAs and RSUs representing equity interests identical to those associated with shares traded in the open market are determined using the market price at the time of grant. Fair value is measured by use of the Black Scholes valuation model for certain RSUs that do not include dividend rights and a stochastic model (a lattice-based model) for share option awards. The expected life of share-based payment awards used in these models is adjusted, based on management best estimate, for the effects of non-transferability, exercise restrictions, and behavioral considerations. Changes in the assumptions used in the stochastic valuation model for share option awards, as well as changes in the company estimates of vesting (including the company evaluation of performance conditions associated with certain share-based payment awards and assumptions used in determining award lapse rates) could have a material impact on the share-based payment charge recorded in each year. There have been no grants of share options since 2005. The table below is a summary, as of December 31, 2009, of equity-settled share-based compensation awards outstanding under the company share-based compensation programs. Details relating to each program are included in Item 8, Financial Statements and Supplementary Data Note 17, Share-Based Compensation. Awards Outstanding Vesting During The Years Ended December 31, Total 2010 2011 2012 2013 2014 Millions of shares Time-vested 17.0 4.9 7.3 2.3 2.4 0.1 Performance-vested 2.0 1.7 * 0.3 Share Awards* 19.0 6.6 7.6 2.3 2.4 0.1 * Included in these share awards are 1.4 million awards which lapsed in January 2010, as it was determined that the performance conditions had not been achieved. Other Compensation Arrangements. We offer certain performance-based cash awards to many of our employees that are based upon purely discretionary determinations or, alternatively, certain formulaic compensation arrangements. The formulaic arrangements require that we monitor on an ongoing basis whether or not pre-established metrics are expected to be met in order to properly record the related expense amounts. Because many of the metrics relate to matters that are highly uncertain or susceptible to change, our estimates may not accurately reflect the ultimate outcomes that will be achieved, and associated expense that should be recognized, with respect to these compensation arrangements. 51 Table of Contents Taxation. We operate in several countries and several states through our various subsidiaries, and must allocate our income, expenses, and earnings under the various laws and regulations of each of these taxing jurisdictions. Accordingly, our provision for income taxes represents our total estimate of the liability that we have incurred for doing business each year in all of our locations. Annually we file tax returns that represent our filing positions within each jurisdiction and settle our return liabilities. Each jurisdiction has the right to audit those returns and may take different positions with respect to income and expense allocations and taxable earnings determinations. Because the determinations of our annual provisions are subject to judgments and estimates, it is possible that actual results will vary from those recognized in our financial statements. As a result, it is likely that additions to, or reductions of, income tax expense will occur each year for prior reporting periods as actual tax returns and tax audits are settled. Deferred tax assets and liabilities are recorded for temporary differences between the tax basis of assets and liabilities and the reported amounts in the Consolidated Financial Statements, using the statutory tax rates in effect for the year in which the differences are expected to reverse. The effect on deferred tax assets and liabilities of a change in tax rates is recognized in the results of operations in the period that includes the enactment date. A valuation allowance is recorded to reduce the carrying amounts of deferred tax assets to the amount that is more likely than not to be realized. As a multinational corporation, the company operates in various locations around the world and we generate substantially all of our earnings from our subsidiaries. Under ASC 740-30, deferred tax liabilities are recognized for taxes that would be payable on the unremitted earnings of the company subsidiaries, consolidated investment products, and joint ventures, except where it is our intention to and we continue to indefinitely reinvest the undistributed earnings. Our Canadian and U.S. subsidiaries continue to be directly owned by Invesco Holding Company Limited (formerly INVESCO PLC, our predecessor company), which is directly owned by Invesco Ltd. Our Canadian unremitted earnings, for which we are indefinitely reinvested, are estimated to be $1,016 million at December 31, 2009, compared with $953 million at December 31, 2008. If distributed as a dividend, Canadian withholding tax of 5.0% would be due. Dividends from our investment in the U.S. should not give rise to additional tax as we are not subject to withholding tax between the U.S. and U.K. Deferred tax liabilities in the amount of $2.3 million (2008: $8.9 million) for additional tax have been recognized for unremitted earnings of certain subsidiaries that have regularly remitted earnings and are expected to continue to remit earnings in the foreseeable future. There is no additional tax on dividends from the U.K. to Bermuda. Net deferred tax assets have been recognized in the U.S., U.K., and Canada based on management belief that taxable income of the appropriate character, more likely than not, will be sufficient to realize the benefits of these assets over time. In the event that actual results differ from our expectations, or if our historical trends of positive operating income in any of these locations changes, we may be required to record a valuation allowance on deferred tax assets, which may have a significant effect on our financial condition and results of operations. The company utilizes a specific recognition threshold and measurement attribute for the financial statement recognition and measurement of a tax position taken or expected to be taken in a tax return. The prescribed two-step process for evaluating a tax position involves first determining whether it is more likely than not that a tax position will be sustained upon examination by the appropriate taxing authorities. If it is, the second step then requires a company to measure this tax position benefit as the largest amount of benefit that is greater than 50 percent likely of being realized upon ultimate settlement. The company recognizes any interest and penalties related to unrecognized tax benefits on the Consolidated Statements of Income as components of income tax expense. Goodwill. Goodwill represents the excess of the cost of an acquired entity over the net of the amounts assigned to assets acquired and liabilities assumed and is recorded in the functional currency of the acquired entity. Goodwill is tested for impairment at the single reporting unit level on an annual basis, or more often if events or circumstances indicate that impairment may exist. If the carrying amount of the reporting unit exceeds its fair value (the first step of the goodwill impairment test), then the second step is performed to determine if goodwill is impaired and to measure the amount of the impairment loss, if any. The second step of the goodwill impairment test compares the implied fair value of goodwill with the carrying amount of goodwill. If the carrying amount of goodwill exceeds the implied fair value of goodwill, an impairment loss is recognized in an amount equal to that excess. We have determined that we have one reportable segment. The company evaluated the components of its business and has determined that it has one reporting unit for purposes of goodwill impairment testing. The company components, business units one level below the operating segment level, include Invesco Worldwide Institutional, Invesco North American Retail, Invesco Perpetual, Invesco Continental Europe and Invesco Asia Pacific. None of the company components are considered individual reporting units as complete operating results are not available for each separate component. The company operating segment represents one reporting unit because all of the components are similar due to the common nature of products and services offered, type of clients, methods of 52 Table of Contents distribution, regulatory environments, manner in which each component is operated, extent to which they share assets and resources, and the extent to which they support and benefit from common product development efforts. The principal method of determining fair value of the reporting unit is an income approach where future cash flows are discounted to arrive at a single present value amount. The discount rate used is derived based on the time value of money and the risk profile of the stream of future cash flows. Recent results and projections based on expectation regarding revenues, expenses, capital expenditures and acquisition earn out payments produce a present value for the reporting unit. While the company believes all assumptions utilized in our assessment are reasonable and appropriate, changes in these estimates could produce different fair value amounts and therefore different goodwill impairment assessments. The most sensitive of these assumptions are the estimated cash flows and the use of a weighted average cost of capital as the discount rate to determine present value. The present value produced for the reporting unit is the fair value of the reporting unit. This amount is reconciled to the company market capitalization to determine an implied control premium, which is compared to an analysis of historical control premiums experienced by peer companies over a long period of time to assess the reasonableness of the fair value of the reporting unit. The company also utilizes a market approach to provide a secondary and corroborative fair value of the reporting unit by using comparable company and transaction multiples to estimate values for our single reporting unit. Discretion and judgment is required in determining whether the transaction data available represents information for companies of comparable nature, scope and size. The results of the secondary market approach to provide a fair value estimate are not combined or weighted with the results of the income approach described above but are used to provide an additional basis to determine the reasonableness of the income approach fair value estimate. The company cannot predict the occurrence of future events that might adversely affect the reported value of goodwill that totaled $6,467.6 million and $5,966.8 million at December 31, 2009, and December 31, 2008, respectively. Such events include, but are not limited to, strategic decisions made in response to economic and competitive conditions, the impact of the economic environment on the company assets under management, or any other material negative change in assets under management and related management fees. The company annual goodwill impairment review is performed as of October 1 of each year. As a result of that analysis, the company determined that no impairment existed at that date. Our goodwill impairment testing conducted during 2009 and 2008 indicated that the fair value of the reporting unit exceeded its carrying value, indicating that step two of the goodwill impairment test was not necessary. Due to deteriorating market conditions, interim impairment tests were performed at October 31, 2008, and March 31, 2009, using the most recently available operating information. These interim tests also concluded that no impairment had occurred. Following the March 31, 2009, interim test, the general market conditions improved and the company did not identify the need for further interim tests during 2009 as no indicators of impairment existed. The March 31, 2009, interim impairment test adopted an income approach consistent with the annual 2008 impairment tests, but utilized the company updated forecasts for changes in AUM due to market gains and long-term net flows and the corresponding changes in revenues and expenses. The primary assumption changes from the October 31, 2008, valuation test were increases in the anticipated rise in equity markets in the near-term and in net AUM sales. The increase in equity markets was based on an analysis of the Dow Jones Industrial Average for 10 recession events between 1945 and 2001. The October 31, 2008, valuation had assumed an equity market rise in-line with more normal non-recessionary experience. The higher AUM net sales reflects new flows into the equity markets as values stabilize and confidence returns, and also took into account the company improved relative investment performance. A discount rate of 13.7% was used for the March 31, 2009, test, similar to the October 31, 2008, rate of 13.6% (October 1, 2008: 11.6%). The discount rates used are estimates of the weighted average cost of capital for the asset management sector reflecting the overall industry risks associated with future cash flows and have been calculated consistently across the various tests dates. The October 1, 2009, annual goodwill impairment test was performed using a consistent methodology to that used for the March 31, 2009, interim impairment test, with the exception that adjustments were made to remove the near-term equity market rise assumption, since much of the market rebound had been experienced in the period between March 31, 2009, and October 1, 2009. A discount rate of 12.9% was used for the October 1, 2009, analysis. A 40% decline in the fair value of our reporting unit, or a 500 basis point increase in the discount rate assumption used during our October 1, 2009, goodwill impairment analysis, would have caused the carrying value of our reporting unit to be in excess of its fair value, which would require the second step to be performed. The second step could have resulted in an impairment loss for goodwill. Investments. Most of our investments are carried at fair value on our balance sheet with the periodic mark-to-market recorded either in accumulated other comprehensive income in the case of available-for-sale investments or directly to earnings in the case of trading assets. Fair value is generally determined by reference to an active trading market, using quoted close or bid prices as of each 53 Table of Contents reporting period end. When a readily ascertainable market value does not exist for an investment (such as our collateralized loan obligations, or CLOs, discussed below) the fair value is calculated based on the expected cash flows of its underlying net asset base, taking into account applicable discount rates and other factors. Since assumptions are made in determining the fair values of investments for which active markets do not exist, the actual value that may be realized upon the sale or other disposition of these investments could differ from the current carrying values. Fair value calculations are also required in association with our quarterly impairment testing of investments. The accuracy of our other-than-temporary impairment assessments is dependent upon the extent to which we are able to accurately determine fair values. Of our $339.8 million total investments at December 31, 2009, those most susceptible to impairment include $74.8 million seed money investments in our affiliated funds and $17.9 million invested in CLO products. Seed money investments are investments held in Invesco managed funds with the purpose of providing capital to the funds during their development periods. These investments are recorded at fair value using quoted market prices in active markets; there is no modeling or additional information needed to arrive at the fair values of these investments. The value of investments may decline for various reasons. The market price may be affected by general market conditions which reflect prospects for the economy as a whole or by specific information pertaining to an industry or individual company. Such declines require further investigation by management, which considers all available evidence to evaluate the realizable value of the investment, including, but not limited to, the following factors: The probability that the company will be unable to collect all amounts due according to the contractual terms of a debt security not impaired at acquisition; The length of time and the extent to which the market value has been less than cost; The financial condition and near-term prospects of the issuer, including any specific events which may influence the operations of the issuer such as changes in technology that may impair the earnings potential of the investment or the discontinuance of a component of the business that may affect the future earnings potential; The intent and ability of the company to retain its investment in the issuer for a period of time sufficient to allow for any anticipated recovery in market value; The decline in the security value due to an increase in market interest rates or a change in foreign exchange rates since acquisition; Determination that the security is not realizable; or An adverse change in estimated cash flows of a beneficial interest. Our other-than-temporary impairment analysis of seed money holdings includes a review of the market returns required for each fund portfolio to enable us to recover our original investment. As part of the review, we analyze several scenarios to project the anticipated recovery period of our original investments based on one-, three-, and five-year historical index returns and historical trends in the equity markets. We also analyze the absolute amount of any loss to date, the trend of the losses, and percent declines in values of the seed money investments. Along with intent and ability to hold, all of these scenarios are considered as part of our other-than-temporary impairment analysis of seed money holdings. The company provides investment management services to a number of CLOs. These entities are investment vehicles created for the sole purpose of issuing CLO instruments that offer investors the opportunity for returns that vary with the risk level of their investment. The notes issued by the CLOs are backed by diversified portfolios consisting primarily of loans or structured debt. For managing the collateral for the CLO entities, the company earns investment management fees, including in some cases subordinated management fees, as well as in certain cases contingent incentive fees. The company has invested in certain of the entities, generally taking a relatively small portion of the unrated, junior subordinated position. At December 31, 2009, the company held $17.9 million of investment in these CLOs (December 31, 2008: $17.5 million), which represents its maximum risk of loss. Our investments in CLOs are generally subordinated to other interests in the entity and entitle the investor to receive the residual cash flows, if any, from the entity. As a result, the company investment is sensitive to changes in the credit quality of the issuers of the collateral securities, including changes in forecasted default rates and declines in anticipated recovery rates. Investors in CLOs have no recourse against the company for any losses sustained in the CLO structure. The company has recorded its investments at fair value primarily using an income approach. Fair value is determined using current information, notably market yields and projected cash flows based on forecasted default and recovery rates that a market participant would use in determining the current fair value of the equity interest. Market yields, default rates and recovery rates used in the 54 Table of Contents company estimate of fair value vary based on the nature of the investments in the underlying collateral pools. In periods of rising market yields, default rates and lower debt recovery rates, the fair value, and therefore carrying value, of the company investments in these CLO entities may be adversely affected. The current liquidity constraints within the market for CLO products require the use of unobservable inputs for CLO valuation. The excess of actual and anticipated future cash flows over the initial investment at the date of purchase is recognized as interest income over the life of the investment using the effective yield method. The company reviews cash flow estimates throughout the life of each CLO entity. Cash flow estimates are based on the underlying pool of securities and take into account the overall credit quality of the issuers, the forecasted default rate of the securities and the company past experience in managing similar securities. If the updated estimate of future cash flows (taking into account both timing and amounts) is less than the last revised estimate, an impairment loss is recognized based on the excess of the carrying amount of the investment over the updated estimate of future cash flows and is recorded through the income statement. As discussed in Item 8, Financial Statements and Supplementary Data Note 1, Accounting Policies, the company adopted FSP FAS 115-2 and FAS 124-2, Recognition and Presentation of Other-Than-Temporary Impairments (FSP FAS 115-2), now encompassed in ASC Topic 320, Investments Debt and Equity Securities (ASC Topic 320), on April 1, 2009. As a result of FSP FAS 115-2, credit-related impairment is recorded through the Statement of Income, and non-credit related impairment is recorded through other comprehensive income. Upon adoption, the company recorded a cumulative effect adjustment of $1.5 million to the April 1, 2009, opening balance of retained earnings with a corresponding adjustment to accumulated other comprehensive income representing the non-credit component of previously recognized other-than-temporary impairment. During the year ended December 31, 2009, an additional $5.2 million was recorded as a charge to earnings representing the credit-related other-than-temporary impairment during the period, and an additional $0.3 million was recorded as a charge to other comprehensive income from other-than-temporary impairment related to non-credit related factors, primarily the change in discount rates during the period. An increase or decrease in the discount rate of 1.0% would change the discounted cash flows of the CLOs by $0.6 million as of December 31, 2009. Consolidated Investment Products. The primary beneficiary of variable interest entities (VIEs) consolidate the VIEs. A VIE is an entity that does not have sufficient equity to finance its operations without additional subordinated financial support, or an entity for which the risks and rewards of ownership are not directly linked to voting interests. Generally, limited partnership entities where the general partner does not have substantive equity investment at risk and where the other limited partners do not have substantive (greater than 50%) rights to remove the general partner or to dissolve the limited partnership are also VIEs. The primary beneficiary is the party to the VIE who absorbs a majority of the losses or retains the majority of the rewards generated by the VIE. Additionally, certain investment products are voting interest entities (VOEs) and are structured as limited partnerships of which the company is the general partner and is deemed to have control with the lack of substantive kick-out, liquidation or participation rights of the other limited partners. These investment products are also consolidated into the company financial statements. Assessing if an entity is a VIE or VOE involves judgment and analysis on a structure-by-structure basis. Factors included in this assessment include the legal organization of the entity, the company contractual involvement with the entity and any related party or de facto agent implications of the company involvement with the entity. Determining if the company is the primary beneficiary of a VIE also requires significant judgment, as the calculation of expected losses and residual returns involves estimation and probability assumptions. If current financial statements are not available for consolidated VIEs or VOEs, estimation of investment valuation is required, which includes assessing available quantitative and qualitative data. Significant changes in these estimates could impact the reported value of the investments held by consolidated investment products and the related offsetting equity attributable to noncontrolling interests in consolidated entities on the Consolidated Balance Sheets and the other gains and losses of consolidated investment products, net, and related offsetting gains and losses attributable to noncontrolling interests in consolidated entities, net, amounts on the Consolidated Statements of Income. As of December 31, 2009, the company consolidated VIEs that held investments of $67.9 million (December 31, 2008: $141.9 million) and VOEs that held investments of $617.1 million (December 31, 2008: $701.9 million). As circumstances supporting estimates and factors change, the determination of VIE and primary beneficiary status may change, as could the determination of the necessity to consolidate VOEs. Contingencies. Contingencies arise when we have a present obligation (legal or constructive) as a result of a past event that is both probable and reasonably estimable. We must from time to time make material estimates with respect to legal and other contingencies. The nature of our business requires compliance with various state and federal statutes and exposes us to a variety of legal proceedings and matters in the ordinary course of business. While the outcomes of matters such as these are inherently uncertain and difficult to predict, we maintain reserves reflected in other current and other non-current liabilities, as appropriate, for identified losses that are, in our judgment, probable and reasonably estimable. Management judgment is based on the advice of legal counsel, ruling on various motions by the applicable court, review of the outcome of similar matters, if applicable, and review of guidance from state or federal agencies, if applicable. Contingent consideration payable in relation to a business acquisition is recorded as of the acquisition date as part of the fair value transferred in exchange for the acquired business. 55 Table of Contents Recent Accounting Developments See Item 8, Financial Statements and Supplementary Data Note 1, Accounting Policies Accounting Pronouncements Recently Adopted and Recent Accounting Pronouncements Not Yet Adopted.
