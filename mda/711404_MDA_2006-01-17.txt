Item 7. Management Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations. Note numbers refer to the Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements beginning on page 57 of this Form 10-K. RESULTS OF OPERATIONS We discuss below the results of our operations for fiscal 2005 compared with fiscal 2004 and the results of our operations for fiscal 2004 compared with fiscal 2003. Certain prior period amounts have been reclassified to conform to the current period presentation. We discuss our cash flows and current financial condition under Capital Resources and Liquidity. The Company growth in fiscal 2005 is primarily due to the inclusion of Ocular business, which the Company acquired on January 6, 2005. 2005 Compared with 2004 Highlights: Fiscal Year 2005 vs. Fiscal Year 2004 Net sales up 65% to $806.6 million. Gross profit up 57%; gross margin decreased to 62% of net sales including integration and restructuring items. Operating income up 16% to $135.8 million. Operating margin at 17% of net sales including integration and restructuring items. Results include the $16.8 million impact related to the step up of Ocular inventory to reflect purchased manufacturing profit sold post acquisition, $20 million write-off of acquired in-process research and development, $12.9 of restructuring and integration costs and the $1.6 million write-off of the debt issuance costs of our previous credit agreement. Effective tax rate (provision for income taxes divided by income before income taxes) down to 15.4% from 17.5%. Diluted earnings per share down 21% to $2.04 from $2.59, including nonrecurring items, with a 26% increase in the number of dilutive shares.

CVI develops, manufactures and markets a broad range of soft contact lenses for the worldwide vision care market. CSI develops, manufactures and markets medical devices, diagnostic products and surgical instruments and accessories used primarily by gynecologists and obstetricians. Our consolidated net sales grew by 65% in 2005 and 19% in 2004. CVI has consistently achieved double-digit net sales growth over the three-year period driven by organic growth as well as acquisitions. CSI achieved 7% net sales growth in 2005, primarily driven by organic growth, and double-digit growth in the prior two periods driven by acquisition and organic growth. Net Sales Growth ($ in millions) 2005 vs. 2004 2004 vs. 2003 Business unit CVI $ 309.3 80% $ 59.1 18% CSI $ 7.2 7% $ 19.3 23% CVI Net Sales by Market ($ in millions) 2005 2004 Growth Americas $ 343.0 $ 217.6 58% Europe 250.1 149.5 67% Asia-Pacific 104.9 21.6 386% $ 698.0 $ 388.7 80% CVI worldwide net sales grew 80%, 77% in constant currency. Americas sales grew 58%, 56% in constant currency. European sales grew 67%, 63% in constant currency. Sales to the Asia-Pacific region grew 386%, 379% in constant currency. The inclusion of Ocular net sales, since the acquisition date of January 6, 2005, is the primary reason for CVI growth in fiscal 2005. CSI Net Sales Women healthcare products used primarily in obstetricians and gynecologists practices generate about 90% of CSI revenue. The balance are sales of medical devices outside of women healthcare where CSI does not actively market. In 2005, CSI sales increased 7% to $108.7 million, $7.2 million above 2004. CSI core revenue grew 10%. While unit growth and product mix influenced organic revenue growth, average realized prices by product did not materially influence such growth. Results of operations of acquired companies are included in our consolidated results beginning on the acquisition date. Acquisitions completed in fiscal 2004 are discussed under 2004 Compared with 2003 in the CSI Net Sales section. 35 Table of Contents Management Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations (Continued) CVI Net Sales Practitioner and patient preferences in the worldwide contact lens market continue to change. The major shifts are from: Conventional lenses replaced annually to disposable and frequently replaced lenses. Disposable lenses are designed for either daily, two-week or monthly replacement; frequently replaced lenses are designed for replacement after one to three months. Commodity lenses to specialty lenses including toric lenses, cosmetic lenses, multifocal lenses, continuous wear lenses and lenses to alleviate dry eye symptoms. Commodity spherical lenses to value-added spherical lenses such as lenses with aspherical optical properties or higher oxygen permeable lenses such as silicone hydrogels. Some of these shifts favor CVI line of specialty products, which now comprise 50% of CVI worldwide business. Definitions: Contact lens revenue includes sales of conventional, disposable and single-use spherical lenses, some of which are aspherically designed, and specialty lenses - toric lenses, cosmetic lenses, long-term extended wear lenses and multifocal lenses. Core product revenue includes specialty lenses and single-use spherical lenses. Aspheric lenses correct for near- and farsightedness and have additional optical properties that help improve visual acuity in low light conditions and can correct low levels of astigmatism and low levels of presbyopia, an age-related vision defect. Toric lens designs correct astigmatism by adding the additional optical properties of cylinder and axis, which correct for irregularities in the shape of the cornea. Cosmetic lenses are opaque and color enhancing lenses that alter the natural appearance of the eye. Multifocal lens designs correct presbyopia. Proclear lenses help enhance tissue/device compatibility and offer improved lens comfort. Sales growth includes continued global market gains during the year, including increases in disposable spherical sales up 121%, disposable toric sales up 62%, disposable multifocal sales up 142% and total toric sales up 51%. CVI core product lines grew 76% with specialty lens growth of 46% during the year. Sales increases also resulted from the global rollout of Proclear toric that increased 62% to $25.4 million and the launch of Proclear multifocal lenses with 2005 sales of $10.6 million. Single-use lens revenue was $72.4 million during the year. Sales growth was driven primarily through increases in the volume of lenses sold, as the market continues to move to more frequent replacement, including within rapidly growing specialty lenses and daily disposable spheres. While unit growth and product mix influenced sales growth, average realized prices by product did not materially influence sales growth. CVI results include Ocular beginning on January 6, 2005, when Cooper acquired Ocular. To present CVI organic growth, we have adjusted reported sales in this discussion for Ocular unaudited net sales when Cooper did not own Ocular of $269.3 million for January 6, 2004 through October 31, 2004 with CVI reported net sales of $388.7 million for Cooper fiscal 2004. Organic net sales grew 6%, 4% in constant currency. Americas sales grew 1%, European sales grew 8%, 5% in constant currency, 36 Table of Contents Management Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations (Continued) and Asia-pacific sales grew 22%, 20% in constant currency. CVI core product lines grew 20% with specialty lens growth of 17% and single-use lens growth of 38%. Disposable lens sales growth included spherical lens sales up 5%, disposable toric sales up 26% and disposable multifocal lens sales up 59%. CVI New Products and Markets During 2005, CVI lost, on an organic basis, market share in the two-week spherical lens market in the United States. New product introductions during 2006 are aimed at growing our revenue and stabilizing our market share. In January 2006, CVI introduced Biomedics XC , a two-week aspheric lens featuring Proclear technology. CVI positioned this product against first generation silicone hydrogel spheres as a product with superior overall patient comfort in daily wear. It will be available as a house brand for customers in the optical chain market, who have been unable to offer a CVI two-week sphere until now, and enable practitioners to offer a new two-week contact lens that is different from silicone hydrogel products. In addition, CVI recently launched a second generation monthly silicone hydrogel spherical lens in Europe and plans to introduce it in the United States in the second half of calendar 2006. An improved Biomedics single-use spherical lens is scheduled for launch worldwide during the first half of calendar 2006. In the toric market, CVI plans to introduce a single-use toric lens in Japan, where more than 60% of the total market is single-use products, in calendar 2006. In the same time frame, CVI plans to introduce a second base curve of Proclear toric in the United States, effectively doubling the number of Proclear parameters available for astigmatic patients. A new two-week multifocal lens, Biomedics Multifocal EP, specifically designed for the emerging presbyopic patient, is scheduled for introduction in calendar 2006. We anticipate that this product will also be particularly attractive to optical chains. Proclear disposable toric multifocal, Proclear single-use sphere with PC technology, and Proclear disposable toric XR are scheduled to be introduced in the second half of calendar 2006. Outlook We believe that CVI will continue to compete successfully in the worldwide contact lens market with its disposable spherical and specialty contact lenses. In the U.S., market demographics are favorable, as the teenage population, the age when most contact lens wear begins, is projected to grow considerably over the next two decades. The reported incidence of myopia continues to increase worldwide. CVI expects greater market penetration in Europe and Asia as practitioners increasingly prescribe more specialty lenses. The acquisition of Ocular has produced a number of benefits to the Company including new technologies, particularly patented silicone hydrogel and single-use lens technologies, new geographic markets, particularly Japan and Germany, and higher volume manufacturing processes, particularly the Gen II platform. CVI will continue to invest in Gen II, which it expects will generate significant gross 37 Table of Contents Management Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations (Continued) margin improvement as it continues to implement and convert products to this manufacturing platform through the end of 2007. Single-use lenses continue to produce double-digit sales growth in all major markets. CVI now has a strengthening presence in Japan. We anticipate that CSI will continue to consolidate the women healthcare market. Favorable demographic trends also support CSI business. The women of the baby-boomer generation are now reaching the age when gynecological procedures are performed most frequently, and CSI has, through both acquisition and internal development, built an extensive product line to diagnose and treat these patients. In November 2005, CSI acquired NeoSurg Technologies, Inc., a manufacturer of a patented combination reusable and disposable trocar access system used in laparoscopic surgery, and Inlet Medical, Inc., a manufacturer of trocar closure systems and pelvic floor reconstruction procedure kits. These purchases advance CSI expansion within the rapidly developing hospital segment of women healthcare. Cooper paid about $50 million for the two companies. CSI plans to develop a separate surgical sales force beginning in 2006 and expects additional selling and interest costs attributed to these transactions. 2004 Compared with 2003 Highlights: Fiscal Year 2004 vs. Fiscal Year 2003 Net sales up 19% to $490.2 million. Gross profit up 19%; gross margin, 64% of net sales. Operating income up 23% to $116.8 million. Operating margin at 24% of net sales up by 1 percentage point. Effective tax rate down to 17.5% from 24%. Diluted earnings per share up 24% to $2.59 from $2.09. CVI Net Sales CVI 2004 revenue growth included continued global market share gains during the year with disposable toric revenue up 45%, total toric product revenue up 22% and disposable sphere revenue up 20%. CVI line of specialty lenses grew 23% during the year. Sales growth was driven primarily through increases in the volume of lenses sold as the market continued to move to more frequent replacement including within rapidly growing specialty lenses. Sales increases also resulted from the global rollout of Proclear toric and multifocal lenses which, respectively, increased 96% and 94% to $15.7 million and $11.4 million in the twelve-month period. Since the acquisition of Biocompatibles in fiscal 2002, CVI has actively marketed Proclear lenses. In many cases, practitioners now recommend Proclear lenses rather than older CVI products. While unit growth and product mix influenced revenue growth, average realized prices by product did not materially influence revenue growth. 38 Table of Contents Management Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations (Continued) CVI Net Sales ($ in millions) 2004 2003 Growth Reported: U.S. $ 184.7 48% $ 164.8 50% 12% International 204.0 52% 164.8 50% 24% Total reported $ 388.7 100% $ 329.6 100% 18% International sales grew 24% (12% in constant currency) to $204 million in 2004, led by sales of two-week and monthly sphere products, which grew $23.3 million, or 27%. Also, sales of two-week and monthly toric products grew 62%, or $20.9 million. International sales growth in 2004 was partially offset by declines in conventional spheres and torics of 17% and 16%, respectively. 2004 sales in the United States grew 12% in fiscal 2004, primarily due to sales of two-week and monthly toric products, which grew 32% to $56.3 million. Also, sales of the Biocompatibles product lines, especially the sales of Proclear specialty lenses, enhanced revenue growth. CVI New Products and Markets During 2004, CVI expanded its product offerings: Two-week disposable toric lens to correct astigmatism introduced in Japan; and Proclear disposable multifocal, a disposable product for wearers with both presbyopia, the blurring of vision that occurs with aging, and the symptoms of dry eye syndrome, introduced in European markets. CSI Net Sales Women healthcare products used primarily in obstetricians and gynecologists practices generated about 90% of CSI revenue. The balance were sales of medical devices outside of women healthcare where CSI does not actively market. In 2004, CSI sales increased 23% to $101.5 million, $19.3 million above 2003, primarily due to recent acquisitions. Organic growth of existing products was about 4%. While unit growth and product mix influenced organic revenue growth, average realized prices by product did not materially influence such growth. 2004 CSI Acquisitions (See Note 2. Acquisitions) In November 2003, CSI purchased from privately-held SURx, Inc., the assets and associated worldwide license rights for the Laparoscopic (LP) and Transvaginal (TV) product lines of its Radio Frequency (RF) Bladder Neck Suspension technology, which uses radio frequency based thermal energy instead of implants to restore continence. In February 2004, Cooper acquired Milex Products, Inc. (Milex), a manufacturer and marketer of obstetric and gynecologic products and customized print services. Milex is a leading supplier of pessaries products used to medically manage female urinary incontinence and pelvic support conditions and also supplies cancer screening products, including endometrial and endocervical 39 Table of Contents Management Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations (Continued) sampling devices and a breast biopsy needle for fine needle aspiration. Milex also publishes patient education materials that discuss prenatal and pregnancy issues, breast health, menopause and osteoporosis. 2005 Compared to 2004 and 2004 Compared to 2003 Cost of Sales/Gross Profit Gross Profit Percentage of Net Sales 2005 2004 2003 CVI 62% 67% 67% CSI 57% 55% 54% Consolidated 62% 64% 64% CVI gross margin for fiscal 2005, at 62%, was lower than 2004 and 2003. The decrease was primarily due to the $16.8 million impact related to the inventory step up adjustment recorded at the acquisition of Ocular and recognized in cost of sales and $5.4 million of restructuring expenses during the year. In addition, we have lower gross margin on single-use lenses that now account for about 10% of CVI net sales. About 46% of lens units are manufactured in the United Kingdom. The favorable impact of currency on revenue is offset by the unfavorable impact on manufacturing costs. CSI gross margin improved to 57% in 2005 from 55% in 2004 as we completed the integration of acquisitions including Milex and shutdown and integrated our Sweden manufacturing facility into the United States. Selling, General and Administrative Expense (SGA) (In millions) 2005 2004 2003 CVI $ 243.0 $ 147.9 $ 127.4 CSI 37.9 31.9 23.7 Headquarters 17.1 10.7 11.8 $ 298.0 $ 190.5 $ 162.9 Consolidated SGA increased by 56% in 2005 and 17% in 2004, in support of the increase in sales. Acquisitions, primarily Ocular, contributed largely to the increase in SGA in 2005. As a percentage of net sales, consolidated SGA decreased to 37% in fiscal 2005 from 39% in 2004 and 40% in 2003. About $4 million of such decrease was due to the relative weakness of the U.S. dollar against foreign currencies on about $133.8 million of SGA outside the U.S. CVI SGA increased 64% in 2005, primarily due to the acquisition of Ocular, and 16% in 2004. SGA as a percentage of net sales decreased to 35% in 2005 from 38% in 2004 on reductions of selling, marketing and distribution costs. CSI 2005 SGA increased 19% over 2004, which supported the 7% increase in sales. Selling and marketing costs increased to support CSI initiative to increase organic growth by continuing the 2004 initiative to expand its direct sales force. In 2004, SGA increased 35% over 2003, which supported CSI initiative to increase organic growth. 40 Table of Contents Management Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations (Continued) Corporate headquarters SGA, which increased 59% to $17.1 million in 2005, decreased to 2.1% of consolidated net sales from 2.2% in 2004 and 2.9% in 2003. These expenses included added costs due to the Ocular acquisition, continued expenses for projects and staff to maintain the Company global trading arrangement and costs to comply with corporate governance requirements. Headquarters 2004 expenses decreased 9% to $10.7 million over 2003 as expenses to maintain our global trading arrangement declined. Research and Development Expense Research and development expense, exclusive of $20 million of acquired in-process research and development related to the acquisition of Ocular, was 3% of net sales in fiscal 2005 and 1% of net sales in fiscal 2004 and 2003: $22.9 million in 2005, $6.5 million in 2004 and $5.6 million in 2003. CVI research and development expenditures, exclusive of $20 million of acquired in-process research and development related to the acquisition of Ocular, were $19.8 million, up 401% over 2004. CVI research and development activities include programs to develop two-week disposable and continuous wear silicone hydrogel lenses, a disposable multifocal toric and a two-week disposable lens incorporating the Proclear technology. CSI research and development expenditures of $3.1 million, up 22%, were for upgrading and redesign of many CSI products in osteoporosis, in-vitro fertilization, incontinence, assisted reproductive technology and other obstetrical and gynecological product development activities. Restructuring Restructuring expenses of $8.5 million in 2005 included $6.1 million of non-acquisition expenses resulting from changes made as a result of the integration of Ocular with CVI and $2.4 million related to integration activities of CSI. In connection with the January 6, 2005, acquisition of Ocular, we are in the process of completing an integration plan to optimize operational synergies of the combined companies. These activities include integrating duplicate facilities, expanding utilization of preferred manufacturing and distribution practices and integrating the worldwide sales and marketing organizations. Integration activities began in January 2005 and are expected to continue through 2007. We estimate that the total restructuring costs under this integration plan will be approximately $25 $30 million and will be reported as charges to cost of sales or restructuring costs in the Consolidated Statement of Income. See Note 2. Acquisitions. Amortization of Intangibles Amortization of intangibles was $11.7 million in 2005, $2.1 million in 2004 and $1.5 million in 2003. Amortization expense increased in fiscal 2005 primarily due to acquired intangible assets. In the fiscal fourth quarter of 2005, Cooper finalized the allocation of the purchase price of Ocular. Cooper adjusted its original allocation estimates by allocating an additional $100 million to other intangible assets from goodwill and recognizing $4 million, net of tax, of additional amortization for the fiscal year. We have restated our quarterly financial data as if the final purchase price allocation was made at the acquisition date of January 6, 2005. See Note 14. Selected Quarterly Financial Data (Unaudited). 41 Table of Contents Management Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations (Continued) Operating Income Operating income grew $40.6 million or 43% between 2003 and 2005: Years Ended October 31, ($ in millions) 2005 2004 2003 CVI $ 135.5 $ 106.6 $ 88.8 CSI 17.4 20.9 18.2 Headquarters (17.1 ) (10.7 ) (11.8 ) $ 135.8 $ 116.8 $ 95.2 Percent growth 17% 23% 42% Other Income, Net Years Ended October 31, (In thousands) 2005 2004 2003 Interest income $ 1,002 $ 351 $ 246 Gain on sale of Quidel stock 120 1,443 621 Foreign exchange (loss)/gain (376 ) 69 1,815 Write-off of debt issuance cost (1,602 ) Gain on derivative instruments 1,945 Other (expense)/income (343 ) (121 ) (473 ) $ 746 $ 1,742 $ 2,209 In fiscal 2005, we sold the remaining 292,000 shares of Quidel stock realizing a gain of about $120,000 and wrote off the debt issuance costs of our previous credit agreement of $1.6 million. The realized gain on derivative instruments of $1.9 million relates to effective hedges in the form of interest rate swaps that did not qualify for hedge accounting treatment, which were terminated and replaced with interest rate swaps that did qualify for hedge accounting treatment. We expect the new swaps to qualify for hedge accounting through their maturities. See Note 7. Financial Instruments. In 2005, we recognized a net loss of about $376,000, primarily related to the British Pound weakening against the U.S. Dollar. In 2004, the British Pound strengthened against the U.S. Dollar, resulting in a net gain of about $69,000. In 2003, the British Pound strengthened against the U.S. Dollar, resulting in a net gain of about $1.8 million. When we acquired Biocompatibles, we inherited intercompany accounts in various currencies, primarily British Pounds. Interest Expense Interest expense increased 373% to $28.1 million in 2005 from $6 million in 2004 and $7 million in 2003. On January 6, 2005, we replaced our $225 million credit facility with a $750 million credit agreement primarily to fund the acquisition of Ocular. Due to the acquisition, we had $557.2 million in loans on our credit facility at October 31, 2005, compared to $49.9 million outstanding on October 31, 2004. On December 12, 2005, we amended and restated our $750 million syndicated credit facility. The amendment and restatement extended maturities and provided the Company with additional borrowing 42 Table of Contents Management Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations (Continued) flexibility and lower overall pricing. The amendment refinanced the $465 million outstanding of Term A and Term B loans under the prior facility and is comprised of a revolving credit facility, which was increased from $275 million to $500 million, and a $250 million term loan. In addition, the Company has the ability from time to time to increase the size of the revolving credit facility by up to an additional $250 million. KeyBank led the amendment process, which resulted in substantially all original syndicate banks retaining or increasing their participation in the agreement. The amendment significantly reduces principal payment requirements in 2006 through 2009. We expect to write off about $4 million of debt issuance costs as a result of amending the original facility. See Note 13. Subsequent Events. Provision for Income Taxes Our effective tax rate (ETR) for fiscal 2005 was 15.4% down from fiscal 2004 ETR of 17.5% and fiscal 2003 ETR of 24%. The reduction of our ETR resulted from a greater percentage of our income being taxed at rates substantially lower than the U.S. statutory rate. We implemented a global trading arrangement in fiscal 1999 to minimize both the taxes reported in our statement of income and the actual taxes we will have to pay when we use all the benefits of our net operating losses (NOL). The global trading arrangement consisted of a restructuring of legal ownership for the CVI foreign sales and manufacturing subsidiaries. CAPITAL RESOURCES AND LIQUIDITY Year 2005 Highlights Operating cash flow up 82% to $183.8 million vs. $101.2 million in 2004. Acquired Ocular Sciences, Inc. and paid other acquisition costs totaling $627.0 million. Expenditures for purchases of property, plant and equipment $117.1 million vs. $40.5 million in 2004. Comparative Statistics Years Ended October 31, ($ in millions) 2005 2004 Cash and cash equivalents $ 30.8 $ 39.4 Total assets $ 2,179.8 $ 811.6 Working capital $ 186.1 $ 192.9 Total debt $ 704.9 $ 165.7 Stockholders equity $ 1,273.2 $ 544.2 Ratio of debt to equity 0.55:1 0.30:1 Debt as a percentage of total capitalization 36% 23% Operating Cash Flows Cash flow provided from operating activities continued as Cooper major source of liquidity, totaling $183.8 million in fiscal 2005 and $101.2 million in 2004. 43 Table of Contents Management Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations (Continued) Working capital decreased $6.8 million in fiscal 2005 due to decreases of $8.5 million in cash and $1.8 million in marketable securities, from sales of securities, and increases of $94.6 million in current accrued liabilities and accounts payable and $51.4 million of short-term debt. These changes were partially offset by increases of $78.1 million in inventory, $53.3 million in receivables and $18.2 million in current deferred tax assets and other. The decrease in working capital is primarily due to the acquisition of Ocular; however, smaller acquisitions and the effect of foreign exchange also contributed to the decrease. At the end of fiscal 2005, Cooper inventory months on hand was 6.7 as compared to 6.9 at fiscal year end 2004. Cooper continued to improve its receivable collections with days of sales outstanding (DSO s) at the end of the current year declining to 62 days from 65 days at October 31, 2004. Looking forward, we expect DSO in the mid to upper 60 given our expectations for continued strong growth outside the United States where DSO are higher. Based on our experience and knowledge of our customers and our analysis of inventoried products and product levels, we believe that our accounts receivable and inventories are recoverable. Investing Cash Flows The cash outflow of $742.3 million for investing activities in 2005 was driven by payments of $627.0 million for acquisitions, primarily the purchase of Ocular, and capital expenditures of $117.1 million used primarily to expand manufacturing capacity and to continue the rollout of new information systems. The cash outflow was partially offset by $1.8 million of cash received from the sale of marketable securities. Financing Cash Flows The cash inflow of $551.8 million from financing activities in 2005 was driven by proceeds from debt of $816.4. million and $25.2 million from the exercise of stock options, partially offset by repayment of debt of $279.8 million, payment of debt acquisition costs of $7.7 million and dividends on our common stock of $2.3 million paid in the first and third quarters of 2005. OFF BALANCE SHEET ARRANGEMENTS None. 44 Table of Contents Management Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations (Continued) CONTRACTUAL OBLIGATIONS AND COMMERCIAL COMMITMENTS As of October 31, 2005, we had the following contractual obligations and commercial commitments: Payments Due by Period (In millions) 2006 2007 & 2008 2009 & 2010 2011 & Beyond Contractual obligations: Long-term debt $ 38.2 $ 105.3 $ 266.4 $ 261.0 Interest payments on long-term debt 33.2 58.9 38.9 43.4 Operating leases 18.2 28.5 19.9 39.7 Total contractual obligations 89.6 192.7 325.2 344.1 Commercial commitments: Stand-by letters of credit 3.8 Total $ 93.4 $ 192.7 $ 325.2 $ 344.1 The expected future benefit payments for pension plans through 2015 are disclosed in Note 10. Employee Benefits. On December 12, 2005, Cooper amended and restated its existing $750 million syndicated bank credit facility. See Note 13. Subsequent Events. Risk Management Most of our operations outside of the United States have their local currency as their functional currency. We are exposed to risks caused by changes in foreign exchange principally on balances denominated in other than the locations functional currency. We have taken steps to minimize our balance sheet exposure. We are also exposed to risks associated with changes in interest rates, as the interest rate on each of our revolving credit agreement and term loan debt varies with the London Interbank Offered Rate. We have decreased this interest rate risk by hedging $500 million of variable rate debt effectively converting it to fixed rate debt for periods of three months to 2 1 / 4 years and issuing fixed rate debt in the form of 2.625% convertible debentures. See Note 1. Summary of Significant Accounting Policies. Outlook We believe that cash and cash equivalents on hand of $30.8 million plus cash generated by operating activities will fund future operations, capital expenditures, cash dividends and smaller acquisitions. At October 31, 2005, we had $179.3 million available under the $750 million syndicated bank credit facility. See Note 13. Subsequent Events, for the effect of our December 12, 2005, refinancing of the credit facility. Inflation and Changing Prices Inflation had no appreciable effect on our operations in the last three years. New Accounting Pronouncement In December 2004, the Financial Accounting Standards Board (FASB) issued FASB Statement No. 123 (revised 2004), Share-Based Payment (SFAS 123R), which replaced FASB Statement No. 123, Accounting for Stock-Based Compensation, (SFAS 123) and superseded Accounting 45 Table of Contents Management Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations (Continued) Principles Board Opinion No. 25, Accounting for Stock Issued to Employees (APB 25). SFAS 123R requires all share-based payments to employees, including grants of employee stock options to be recognized in the financial statements based on their grant date fair values. Under SFAS 123R, the pro forma disclosures previously permitted no longer will be an alternative to financial statement recognition. SFAS 123R was originally effective for all interim or annual periods beginning after June 15, 2005, with early adoption encouraged. In April 2005, the Securities and Exchange Commission (the SEC ) postponed the effective date of SFAS 123R until the issuer first fiscal year beginning after June 15, 2005. In March 2005, the SEC issued Staff Accounting Bulletin No. 107 (SAB 107) regarding the SEC interpretations of SFAS 123R and the valuation of share-based payments for public companies. Cooper will adopt SFAS 123R in the first quarter of fiscal 2006 using the modified prospective method, which requires that compensation expense be recorded for all unvested stock options and restricted stock upon adoption. Cooper will apply both the Black-Scholes and binomial valuation models to estimate the fair value of share-based payments to employees, which will then be amortized on a ratable basis over the requisite service period. Cooper is evaluating the requirements of SFAS 123R and SAB 107 and expects that the adoption of SFAS 123R on November 1, 2005 will have a material impact on Cooper consolidated results of operations and earnings per share beginning in the first quarter of fiscal 2006. Cooper assessment of the estimated compensation charges is affected by Cooper stock price as well as assumptions regarding a number of complex and subjective variables and the related tax impact resulting in uncertainty as to whether future stock-based compensation expense will be similar to the historical SFAS 123 pro forma expense. These variables include, but are not limited to, the volatility of our stock price and employee stock option exercise behaviors. Estimates and Critical Accounting Policies Management estimates and judgments are an integral part of financial statements prepared in accordance with accounting principles generally accepted in the United States of America (GAAP). We believe that the critical accounting policies described in this section address the more significant estimates required of management when preparing our consolidated financial statements in accordance with GAAP. We consider an accounting estimate critical if changes in the estimate may have a material impact on our financial condition or results of operations. We believe that the accounting estimates employed are appropriate and resulting balances are reasonable; however, actual results could differ from the original estimates requiring adjustment to these balances in future periods. Revenue recognition We recognize revenue when it is realized or realizable and earned, based on terms of sale with the customer, where persuasive evidence of an agreement exists, delivery has occurred, the seller price is fixed and determinable and collectibility is reasonably assured. For contact lenses as well as CSI medical devices, diagnostic products and surgical instruments and accessories, this primarily occurs upon product shipment, when risk of ownership transfers to our customers. We believe our revenue recognition policies are appropriate in all circumstances, and that our policies are reflective of our customer arrangements. We record, based on historical statistics, estimated reductions to revenue for customer incentive programs offered including cash discounts, promotional and advertising allowances, volume discounts, contractual pricing 46 Table of Contents Management Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations (Continued) allowances, rebates and specifically established customer product return programs. While estimates are involved, historically, most of these programs have not been major factors in our business, since a high percentage of our revenue is from direct sales to doctors. Allowance for doubtful accounts Our reported balance of accounts receivable, net of the allowance for doubtful accounts, represents our estimate of the amount that ultimately will be realized in cash. We review the adequacy of our allowance for doubtful accounts on an ongoing basis, using historical payment trends and the age of the receivables and knowledge of our individual customers. When our analyses indicate, we increase or decrease our allowance accordingly. However, if the financial condition of our customers were to deteriorate, additional allowances may be required. While estimates are involved, bad debts historically have not been a significant factor given the diversity of our customer base, well established historical payment patterns and the fact that patients require satisfaction of healthcare needs in both strong and weak economies. Net realizable value of inventory In assessing the value of inventories, we must make estimates and judgments regarding aging of inventories and other relevant issues potentially affecting the saleable condition of products and estimated prices at which those products will sell. On an ongoing basis, we review the carrying value of our inventory, measuring number of months on hand and other indications of salability, and reduce the value of inventory if there are indications that the carrying value is greater than market. At the point of the loss recognition, a new, lower-cost basis for that inventory is established, and subsequent changes in facts and circumstances do not result in the restoration or increase in that newly established cost basis. While estimates are involved, historically, obsolescence has not been a significant factor due to long product dating and lengthy product life cycles. We target to keep, on average, about seven months of inventory on hand to maintain high customer service levels in spite of the complexity of our specialty lens product portfolio. Valuation of goodwill We account for goodwill and evaluate our goodwill balances and test them for impairment in accordance with the provisions of FASB Statement No. 142, Goodwill and Other Intangible Assets. We no longer amortize goodwill. We test goodwill for impairment annually during the third fiscal quarter and when an event occurs or circumstances change such that it is reasonably possible that impairment may exist. We performed an impairment test in our fiscal third quarter 2005, and our analysis indicated that we had no goodwill impairment. The FASB Statement No. 142 goodwill impairment test is a two-step process. Initially, we compare the book value of net assets to the fair value of each reporting unit that has goodwill assigned to it. If the fair value is determined to be less than the book value, a second step is performed to compute the amount of the impairment. When available and as appropriate, we use comparative market multiples to corroborate fair value results. A reporting unit is the level of reporting at which goodwill is tested for impairment. Our reporting units are the same as our business segments CooperVision and CooperSurgical reflecting the way that we manage our business. Our most recent estimate of fair value, at the time of our May 1, 2005 review and using several valuation techniques including assessing industry multiples, for CVI ranged from $1.9 billion to $3.6 billion compared to a carrying value of $1.7 billion and for CSI ranged from $260 million to $436 million compared to a carrying value of $174 million. 47 Table of Contents Management Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations (Continued) Business combinations We routinely consummate business combinations. We allocate the purchase price of acquisitions based on our estimates and judgments of the fair value of net assets purchased, acquisition costs incurred and intangibles other than goodwill. On individually significant acquisitions, we utilize independent valuation experts to provide a basis in order to refine the purchase price allocation, if appropriate. Results of operations for acquired companies are included in our consolidated results of operations from the date of acquisition. Income taxes As part of the process of preparing our consolidated financial statements, we must estimate our income tax expense for each of the jurisdictions in which we operate. This process requires significant management judgments and involves estimating our current tax exposures in each jurisdiction including the impact, if any, of additional taxes resulting from tax examinations as well as judging the recoverability of deferred tax assets. To the extent recovery of deferred tax assets is not likely based on our estimation of future taxable income in each jurisdiction, a valuation allowance is established. Tax exposures can involve complex issues and may require an extended period to resolve. Frequent changes in tax laws in each jurisdiction complicate future estimates. To determine the quarterly tax rate, we are required to estimate full-year income and the related income tax expense in each jurisdiction. We adjust the estimated effective tax rate for the tax related to significant unusual items. Changes in the geographic mix or estimated level of annual pre-tax income can affect the overall effective tax rate, and such changes could be material. 48 Table of Contents
