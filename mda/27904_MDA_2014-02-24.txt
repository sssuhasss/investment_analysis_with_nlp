ITEM 7. MANAGEMENT'S DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS OF FINANCIAL CONDITION AND RESULTS OF OPERATIONS Financial Highlights - 2013 Compared to 2012 Our net income for 2013 was $10.5 billion, which reflects $8.0 billion of income tax benefits primarily due to the release of the tax valuation allowance. Income before income taxes was $2.5 billion, representing a $1.5 billion improvement over prior year. Our pre-tax operating margin rose by 4 percentage points to 7% on both higher revenues and lower costs. 2013 was a successful year for Delta based on several measures. Our pre-tax profits were 147% higher than the prior year. Our operating performance led the industry, driving customer satisfaction and doubling our domestic net promoter scores, a metric measuring customer satisfaction. Our completion factor was 99.7% with over 70 days where none of our flights were canceled. We ranked number two in the industry for bag performance as measured by the U.S. Department of Transportation. During the year, we returned over $350 million to our shareholders through dividends and a share purchase program. We also rejoined the Standard & Poor's 500 index of large companies. Revenue. Our passenger revenue increased $1.2 billion, despite a lower market price of fuel. We experienced positive market reaction to our first class upsell and Economy Comfort products. Our customers value these products, which together contributed more than $600 million in revenues. Our geographic regions performed well compared to the prior year, with the domestic region leading year-over-year unit revenue improvement. Unit revenues of the domestic region rose by over 5% with notable improvements in the New York market. New York unit revenues increased as we continue to see improvements due to our investments in JFK and LaGuardia, as well as many in-flight product enhancements. Revenues related to our international regions were generally flat year-over-year, with slight unit revenue improvements in both Atlantic and Latin America regions. Our Pacific region experienced a slight decline in unit revenues primarily due to the Yen devaluation. Operating Expense. Total operating expense decreased $122 million from 2012. As a result, our consolidated operating cost per available seat mile ("CASM") for 2013 decreased 1% to 14.77 cent s from 14.97 cent s in 2012, on a 1% increase in capacity. CASM-Ex (a non-GAAP financial measure) was 9.14 cent s in 2013, or 2% higher than 2012. Changes in our total operating expenses reflect decreased fuel expense offset by higher salaries and related costs and profit sharing. Fuel expense for 2013 was $11.5 billion , including regional carriers; our average price per gallon was $3.00, which was $0.25 lower than 2012. Our average price per gallon, adjusted was $3.07 (a non-GAAP financial measure), which was $0.19 lower than 2012. Our fuel cost includes net airline segment fuel hedge gains for the year of $444 million, and a loss on refinery operations of $116 million, or $0.03 per gallon. The higher salaries expense represents wage increases and shows the continued investment we are making in our employees. Delta relies on its employees for its operational and financial success. As a result of our success in 2013, we will pay our employees record profit sharing of $506 million, which represents over 8% of an employee's annual pay, and is a 36% year-over-year increase. Income Tax . We have released the tax valuation allowance that placed a reserve against certain tax assets. We now believe that, given the company's financial performance, we will be able to use these tax assets to offset future cash income tax liabilities. We recognized an $8.0 billion tax benefit primarily as a result of releasing the valuation, which was recorded in income tax benefit (provision) in our Consolidated Statement of Operations. Beginning in 2014, we expect to record income tax expense with an effective rate of approximately 38%. As of December 31, 2013, we have more than $15 billion of net operating loss carryforwards ("NOLs") that will be used to offset cash income taxes due on future earnings. The non-GAAP financial measure CASM-Ex used in this section is defined and reconciled in "Supplemental Information" below. Average fuel price per gallon, adjusted is defined and reconciled in "Results of Operations - Year Ended 2013 and 2012 - Operating Expense" below. Company Initiatives Increasing Shareholder Value We continue to focus on cash flow generation with the goal of further strengthening our balance sheet. We finished 2013 with $5.7 billion in unrestricted liquidity (consisting of cash, cash equivalents, short-term investments and undrawn revolving credit facility capacity). During 2013, we generated $4.5 billion in cash from operating activities, reduced debt by $1.4 billion and funded capital expenditures of $2.6 billion and returned $350 million to shareholders, while maintaining a solid liquidity position. 27 In May 2013, we announced a plan to return more than $1 billion to shareholders over the next three years. As part of this plan, our Board of Directors initiated a quarterly dividend program and declared a $0.06 per share dividend for shareholders of record as of August 9, 2013 and November 6, 2013. These dividends were paid in September 2013 and November 2013 and each totaled $51 million . In addition, the Board of Directors authorized a $500 million share repurchase program, to be completed no later than June 30, 2016 . During 2013 , we repurchased and retired approximately 10 million shares at a cost of approximately $250 million . On February 7, 2014, our Board of Directors declared a $0.06 dividend for shareholders of record on February 21, 2014 and payable on March 14, 2014. Network Strategy We are implementing several strategies that are designed to strengthen and expand our global network and presence. These include our investment in and joint venture with Virgin Atlantic, improvements at our hubs at LaGuardia and JFK in New York and the creation of an international gateway in Seattle. Virgin Atlantic Investment. In 2013, we purchased a 49% interest in Virgin Atlantic from Singapore Airlines for $360 million. We also entered into an agreement with Virgin Atlantic with respect to operations on non-stop routes between the United Kingdom and North America. In September 2013, the U.S. Department of Transportation granted antitrust immunity on these routes.The antitrust immunized relationship allows for joint marketing and sales, coordinated pricing and revenue management, network planning and scheduling with respect to operations on routes between North America and the United Kingdom. Virgin Atlantic has a significant presence at London's Heathrow airport, the airport of choice for business travelers traveling to and from London. Along with our state of the art facility at JFK, we believe our relationship with Virgin Atlantic will provide our customers with superior service and connectivity between New York and London. Beginning January 1, 2014, we began working under the immunized relationship and published our first coordinated schedule that becomes effective April 2014. LaGuardia. During December 2011, we closed transactions with US Airways in which we received takeoff and landing rights (each a "slot pair") at LaGuardia in exchange for slot pairs at Reagan National. This exchange allowed us to create a new domestic hub at LaGuardia. We have increased capacity at LaGuardia by approximately 50% since March 2012, adding 123 new flights and a total of 31 new destinations. We currently operate about 277 daily flights between LaGuardia and 65 cities, more than any other airline. We are investing approximately $200 million in a renovation and expansion project at LaGuardia to enhance the customer experience. In 2012, we opened the connector linking Terminals C and D and a new SkyClub in Terminal C. We are also expanding security lanes and a baggage handling system in both terminals as well as an enhanced SkyClub in Terminal D. JFK. While our expanded LaGuardia schedule is focused on providing industry-leading domestic service, we are optimizing our international and trans-continental flight schedule and undertaking a redevelopment project at JFK to facilitate convenient connections for our passengers and improve coordination with our SkyTeam alliance partners. Prior to beginning the redevelopment project, we primarily operated domestic flights out of Terminal 2 and international flights out of Terminal 3. Our initial five-year project to expand and enhance Terminal 4, which began in 2010, is on schedule. We have constructed nine new international gates in Terminal 4, which opened in 2013. We have relocated our operations from Terminal 3 to our newly constructed facilities at Terminal 4 and have begun the demolition of Terminal 3. During 2013, we announced plans for an additional $180 million expansion project that will add 11 more gates at Terminal 4. With the additional expansion, we will relocate our regional jet operations from Terminal 2 to Terminal 4. We expect that passengers will benefit from an enhanced customer experience and improved operational performance, including reduced taxi times and better on-time performance. Seattle International Gateway Expansion. Seattle is one of Delta fastest-growing international gateways. We have recently expanded service in Seattle, with additional frequencies and destinations, both domestically and internationally. We have invested in our facilities, including a renovated lobby, a new Delta SkyClub and many other customer enhancements. By expanding in Seattle, we will have improved service for our local customers and increased connection into Asia. Maintaining Cost Performance Beginning in 2012, we implemented a cost initiatives program, which is expected to stem the rate of cost growth to less than 2% cost inflation annually. These initiatives are designed to improve our cost efficiency while maintaining our operational performance and revenue generation. An important component is the fleet restructuring initiative to retire older, less efficient aircraft from our fleet. 28 Fleet Restructuring Fleet restructuring is an important component of our cost initiatives, and is focused on lowering unit costs while investing in our fleet to enhance the customer experience. We are restructuring our domestic fleet by reducing our 50-seat regional flying and replacing other older, less cost effective aircraft with newer, more efficient aircraft. Agreements with SkyWest Airlines, Inc. and Bombardier Aerospace, as well as our acquisition of Endeavor, have produced a path for us to eliminate more than 200 50-seat aircraft. We are replacing these aircraft and older B-757-200 aircraft with more efficient and customer preferred CRJ-900, B-717-200 and B-737-900ER aircraft. In 2012, we entered into an agreement with Bombardier Aerospace to purchase 40 CRJ-900 aircraft with 12 deliveries this year and 28 in 2014. Also in 2012, we finalized agreements with Southwest Airlines and The Boeing Company ("Boeing") to lease 88 B-717-200 aircraft. Delivery of the aircraft began in September 2013, with a total of 13 aircraft delivered in 2013, 39 aircraft deliveries expected in 2014 and 36 aircraft deliveries expected in 2015. These B-717-200 aircraft are 110-seat aircraft and feature new, fully upgraded interiors, with 12 First Class seats, 15 Economy Comfort seats and in-flight WiFi throughout the cabin. In 2011, we entered into an agreement with Boeing to purchase 100 new fuel efficient B-737-900ER aircraft. We took delivery of the first B-737-900ER aircraft in September 2013 and will continue adding these aircraft to our fleet through 2018, primarily replacing older B-757-200 aircraft. We expect the B-737-900ER to offer an industry leading customer experience, including expanded carry-on baggage space and a spacious cabin. In addition, we entered into an agreement in September 2013 with Airbus to purchase 10 international capable widebody A330-300 and 30 large narrowbody A321-200 aircraft expected to serve domestic markets. Delivery of the first A330-300 aircraft is expected to occur in spring 2015, with three additional A330-300 aircraft expected to be delivered in 2015, four aircraft in 2016 and two in 2017. Delivery of three A321-200 aircraft are scheduled for the first quarter of 2016, with 12 additional aircraft expected to be delivered later in 2016 and 15 in 2017. As mentioned above, an important component of the fleet restructuring initiative is to reduce 50-seat CRJ aircraft, which are our least fuel efficient aircraft and have the lowest customer satisfaction ratings. We are targeting a fleet size of 100 to 125 aircraft within the next two years. Our current fleet includes aircraft we lease and aircraft that are operated for us by regional carriers that own or lease aircraft through third parties. As part of the reduction, we will retire a significant portion of the fleet that is leased by us. We expect to continue to recognize material restructuring charges, representing the remaining obligations under the leases, as we retire the leased aircraft. Although many factors could change over the next two years, we currently estimate that future charges will be between $200 million to $300 million, in addition to the $107 million recorded in 2013. The timing and amount of these charges will depend on a number of factors, including our final negotiations with lessors, the timing of removing aircraft from service and the ultimate disposition of aircraft included in the fleet restructuring program. Also, to accelerate the restructuring of the fleet, we may park a portion of the fleet on a temporary basis until contracts for aircraft flying under contract carrier agreements expire. The temporarily parked aircraft will be returned to service as aircraft flying under these expiring agreements exit the fleet. We will continue to incur operating lease expense for these temporarily parked aircraft. As a result of restructuring the fleet, we expect to benefit from improved operational and fuel efficiency, customer service and reduced future maintenance cost that we will experience over the life of the new aircraft. Fuel Expense, including refinery results Fuel Expense. Fuel expense is our largest expense, representing 33% of total operating expenses. For 2013, our total fuel expense decreased $787 million (including our regional carriers under capacity purchase agreements) compared to 2012. This decrease is primarily due to reduced market jet fuel prices and an increase in gains from our hedging activities. Excluding mark-to-market adjustments on hedges recorded in periods other than the settlement period ("MTM adjustments"), our fuel price per gallon, adjusted (a non-GAAP financial measure) for 2013 was $3.07 per gallon, compared to $3.26 per gallon in 2012. The market volatility of jet fuel prices greatly impacts our fuel costs. We manage our fuel cost through three primary methods: purchase agreements, fuel hedging and the operation of a refinery. 29 Fuel Purchase Cost. The market price per gallon of jet fuel decreased 4% , compared to 2012, which lowered our purchase cost of fuel. This decrease was partially offset by a 2% increase in consumption on higher capacity. Fuel Hedging Program Impact. We actively manage our fuel price risk through a hedging program intended to reduce the financial impact on us from changes in the price of jet fuel. During 2013, our consolidated fuel hedge gain was $493 million . This hedge gain included $276 million of MTM adjustments. These MTM adjustments are based on market prices as of the end of the reporting period for contracts settling in future periods. Such market prices are not necessarily indicative of the actual future value of the underlying hedge in the contract settlement period. Refinery Segment Impact. Global jet fuel demand continues to increase. While the advent of shale oil production in the U.S. has reduced the threat of U.S. refinery closures beyond those that have already closed, further capacity reduction is expected in Europe, thus impacting supply in the Atlantic Basin and ultimately increasing refinery margins in the U.S. Our wholly-owned subsidiaries, Monroe Energy, LLC and MIPC, LLC (collectively, Monroe ), operate the Trainer refinery and related assets located near Philadelphia, Pennsylvania as part of our strategy to mitigate the increasing cost of the refining margin we are paying. The facilities include pipelines and terminal assets that allow the refinery to supply jet fuel to our airline operations throughout the Northeastern U.S., including our New York hubs at LaGuardia and JFK. The refinery produces primarily gasoline, diesel and jet fuel. Under multi-year agreements, we are effectively exchanging the non-jet fuel products with Phillips 66 and BP for jet fuel to be used in our airline operations. The refinery produced approximately 162,000 barrels per day in 2013. The jet fuel produced and procured through exchanging gasoline and diesel fuel produced by the refinery provided approximately 150,000 barrels per day for use in airline operations during 2013. A refinery is subject to U.S. Environmental Protection Agency ("EPA") requirements that are established each year to blend renewable fuels into the gasoline and on-road diesel fuel it produces. Alternatively, a refinery may purchase renewable energy credits, called RINs, from third parties in the secondary market. Because the refinery operated by Monroe does not blend renewable fuels, it must purchase its entire RINs requirement in the secondary market or obtain a waiver from the EPA. The refinery is exposed to the market price of RINs. For example, the average historical price of ethanol RINs ranged from $0.02 to $0.05 per RIN in prior years, but the market price increased to over $1.40 per RIN during 2013; the price at December 31, 2013 was $0.34 per RIN. Compliance with the RINs requirement by purchasing RINs, if available in the secondary market, at elevated prices could have a material impact on our results of operations and cash flows for 2014. We recognized $64 million of expense related to the RINs requirement in 2013, which is included in the refinery's results. We believe that holders of RINs have been withholding them from the secondary market. This reduction of available RINs significantly impairs the secondary market as a means of compliance with the RINs requirement. Therefore, the Company is pursuing legal, regulatory and legislative solutions to this problem. The refinery recorded a loss of $116 million in 2013. The refinery's results were impacted by the cost of RINs that far exceeded their historical averages, as discussed above. In addition, we believe that the increase in jet fuel supply due to the refinery's operation has decreased the overall market price of jet fuel, and lowered our cost of jet fuel. 30 Results of Operations - 2013 Compared to 2012 Operating Revenue Year Ended December 31, Increase (Decrease) % Increase (Decrease) (in millions) 2013 2012 Passenger: Mainline $ 26,534 $ 25,173 $ 1,361 5 % Regional carriers 6,408 6,581 (173 ) (3 )% Total passenger revenue 32,942 31,754 1,188 4 % Cargo 937 990 (53 ) (5 )% Other 3,894 3,926 (32 ) (1 )% Total operating revenue $ 37,773 $ 36,670 $ 1,103 3 % Increase (Decrease) vs. Year Ended December 31, 2012 (in millions) Year Ended December 31, 2013 Passenger Revenue RPMs (Traffic) ASMs (Capacity) Passenger Mile Yield PRASM Load Factor Domestic $ 15,204 8 % 1 % 2 % 6 % 5 % (0.8 ) pts Atlantic 5,657 3 % 1 % (1 )% 2 % 3 % 1.2 pts Pacific 3,561 (2 )% 1 % (1 )% (2 )% (1 )% 1.3 pts Latin America 2,112 11 % 11 % 8 % (1 )% 2 % 2.3 pts Total mainline 26,534 5 % 2 % 2 % 3 % 4 % 0.3 pts Regional carriers 6,408 (3 )% (6 )% (3 )% 3 % 1 % (1.8 ) pts Total passenger revenue $ 32,942 4 % 1 % 1 % 3 % 3 % pts Passenger Revenue. Passenger revenue increased $1.2 billion , or 4% , on a 3% PRASM increase and a 3% increase in passenger mile yield. Revenue remained strong despite lower fuel prices. In addition, the increase in passenger revenue reflects the investments for in-flight product enhancements such as the Economy Comfort product and higher corporate sales. Our geographic regions performed well compared to the prior year, with the domestic region leading year-over-year unit revenue improvement as a result of higher passenger mile yield. Unit revenues of the domestic region rose by over 5% with notable improvements in the New York market. New York unit revenues increased as we continue to see improvements due to our investments in JFK and LaGuardia, as well as many in-flight product enhancements. Revenues related to our international regions were generally flat year-over-year, with slight unit revenue improvements in both Atlantic and Latin America regions. Our Pacific region experienced a slight decline in unit revenues primarily due to the Yen devaluation. 31 Operating Expense Year Ended December 31, Increase (Decrease) % Increase (Decrease) (in millions) 2013 2012 Aircraft fuel and related taxes $ 9,397 $ 10,150 $ (753 ) (7 )% Salaries and related costs 7,720 7,266 454 6 % Regional carrier expense 5,669 5,647 22 % Aircraft maintenance materials and outside repairs 1,852 1,955 (103 ) (5 )% Contracted services 1,665 1,566 99 6 % Depreciation and amortization 1,658 1,565 93 6 % Passenger commissions and other selling expenses 1,603 1,590 13 1 % Landing fees and other rents 1,410 1,336 74 6 % Passenger service 762 732 30 4 % Profit sharing 506 372 134 36 % Aircraft rent 209 272 (63 ) (23 )% Restructuring and other items 402 452 (50 ) NM (1) Other 1,520 1,592 (72 ) (5 )% Total operating expense $ 34,373 $ 34,495 $ (122 ) % (1) NM - not meaningful. For a discussion of charges recorded in restructuring and other items, see Note 16 of the Notes to the Consolidated Financial Statements. Fuel Expense. Including regional carriers under capacity purchase agreements, fuel expense decreased $787 million because of a 4% decrease in fuel market price per gallon and fuel hedge gains, partially offset by a 2% increase in consumption. The table below presents fuel expense, gallons consumed and our average price per gallon, including the impact of fuel hedging and the refinery: Year Ended December 31, Increase (Decrease) % Increase (Decrease) (in millions, except per gallon data) 2013 2012 Aircraft fuel and related taxes (1) $ 9,397 $ 10,150 $ (753 ) Aircraft fuel and related taxes included within regional carrier expense 2,067 2,101 (34 ) Total fuel expense $ 11,464 $ 12,251 $ (787 ) (6 )% Total fuel consumption (gallons) 3,828 3,769 59 2 % Average price per gallon $ 3.00 $ 3.25 $ (0.25 ) (8 )% (1) Includes the impact of fuel hedging and refinery results described further in the table below.

Fuel purchase cost is based on the market price for jet fuel at airport locations. Refinery Impact. The refinery results include the impact on fuel expense of self-supply from the production of the refinery and from refined products exchanged with Phillips 66 and BP. As described in Note 2 of the Notes to the Consolidated Financial Statements, to the extent that we account for exchanges of refined products as non-monetary transactions, we include the results of those transactions within fuel expense. Fuel Hedge (Gains) Losses and MTM Adjustments. During the year ended December 31, 2013, our airline segment fuel hedge gains of $444 million included $276 million of MTM adjustments. These MTM adjustments are based on market prices as of the end of the reporting period for contracts settling in future periods. Such market prices are not necessarily indicative of the actual future value of the underlying hedge in the contract settlement period. The gains for MTM adjustments are reflected in the table above to calculate an effective fuel cost for the period. We adjust fuel expense for these items to arrive at a more meaningful measure of fuel cost. Our average price per gallon, adjusted (a non-GAAP financial measure) was $3.07 for the year ended December 31, 2013. Salaries and Related Costs . The increase in salaries and related costs is primarily due to employee pay increases. During the June 2012 quarter, we reached an agreement with ALPA that increases pay and benefits for our pilots. Our pilots and substantially all other employees received base pay increases on July 1, 2012 and received additional increases on January 1, 2013. These increases are designed both to recognize changes to the profit sharing program described below and to accelerate the planned 2013 pay increase for non-pilot employees. Aircraft Maintenance Materials and Outside Repairs. Aircraft maintenance materials and outside repairs consists of costs associated with maintenance of aircraft used in our operations and maintenance sales to third parties by our MRO services business. The decrease in maintenance costs is primarily due to lower volume of sales to third parties of our MRO services and the cyclical timing of maintenance events on our fleet. Contracted Services. Contracted services expense increased year-over-year due primarily to the impact of severe winter storms on our operations and costs associated with the 1% increase in capacity. Depreciation and amortization. Depreciation and amortization expense increased year-over-year primarily due to our investment in the purchase of aircraft and aircraft modifications that upgraded aircraft interiors and enhanced our product offering. Landing fees and other rents. Landing fees and other rents increased year-over-year primarily due to our investment in airport facilities. Profit Sharing. Our broad based employee profit sharing program provides that, for each year in which we have an annual pre-tax profit, as defined by the terms of the program, we will pay a specified portion of that profit to employees. In determining the amount of profit sharing, the terms of the program specify the exclusion of special items, such as MTM adjustments and restructuring and other items, from pre-tax profit. During the June 2012 quarter, our profit sharing program was modified so that we will pay 10% of profits on the first $2.5 billion of annual profits effective with the plan year beginning January 1, 2013 compared to paying 15% of annual profits for the 2012 plan year. Under the program, we will continue to pay 20% of annual profits above $2.5 billion. Aircraft Rent. Aircraft rent decreased year-over-year due primarily due to purchasing aircraft off-lease. 33 Results of Operations - 2012 Compared to 2011 Operating Revenue Year Ended December 31, Increase % Increase (in millions) 2012 2011 Passenger: Mainline $ 25,173 $ 23,843 $ 1,330 6 % Regional carriers 6,581 6,414 167 3 % Total passenger revenue 31,754 30,257 1,497 5 % Cargo 990 1,027 (37 ) (4 )% Other 3,926 3,831 95 2 % Total operating revenue $ 36,670 $ 35,115 $ 1,555 4 % Increase (Decrease) vs. Year Ended December 31, 2011 (in millions) Year Ended December 31, 2012 Passenger Revenue RPMs (Traffic) ASMs (Capacity) Passenger Mile Yield PRASM Load Factor Domestic $ 14,134 7 % 1 % % 6 % 7 % 0.8 pts Atlantic 5,514 (1 )% (4 )% (7 )% 3 % 6 % 2.8 pts Pacific 3,619 11 % 6 % 3 % 5 % 8 % 2.6 pts Latin America 1,906 8 % 6 % 3 % 2 % 5 % 2.7 pts Total mainline 25,173 6 % 1 % (1 )% 5 % 7 % 1.7 pts Regional carriers 6,581 3 % (4 )% (5 )% 7 % 8 % 0.7 pts Total passenger revenue $ 31,754 5 % % (2 )% 5 % 7 % 1.7 pts Passenger Revenue. Passenger revenue increased $1.5 billion , or 5% , due to an improvement in the passenger mile yield of 5% , on a 2% decline in capacity. Passenger mile yield and unit revenue increased due to fare increases, higher revenue under corporate travel contracts and improvements in our products and services. International mainline passenger revenue increased $520 million. In early 2011, we faced industry overcapacity in the transatlantic market and in connection with our joint venture partners, AirFrance-KLM and Alitalia, we reduced capacity in underperforming markets during the second half of 2011 and in 2012. As a result, Atlantic PRASM was up 6% , driven by a 3% increase in yield on a 7% decrease in capacity. Pacific passenger revenue increased 11% on a 3% and 6% increase in capacity and traffic, respectively. These results reflect Pacific market improvement, as demand returned to levels seen prior to the March 2011 earthquake and tsunami in Japan. Latin America passenger revenue increased 8% on a 3% and 6% increase in capacity and traffic, respectively. 34 Operating Expense Year Ended December 31, Increase (Decrease) % Increase (Decrease) (in millions) 2012 2011 Aircraft fuel and related taxes $ 10,150 $ 9,730 $ 420 4 % Salaries and related costs 7,266 6,894 372 5 % Regional carrier expense 5,647 5,470 177 3 % Aircraft maintenance materials and outside repairs 1,955 1,765 190 11 % Passenger commissions and other selling expenses 1,590 1,682 (92 ) (5 )% Contracted services 1,566 1,642 (76 ) (5 )% Depreciation and amortization 1,565 1,523 42 3 % Landing fees and other rents 1,336 1,281 55 4 % Passenger service 732 721 11 2 % Profit sharing 372 264 108 41 % Aircraft rent 272 298 (26 ) (9 )% Restructuring and other items 452 242 210 NM (1) Other 1,592 1,628 (36 ) (2 )% Total operating expense $ 34,495 $ 33,140 $ 1,355 4 % (1) For a discussion of charges recorded in restructuring and other items, see Note 16 of the Notes to the Consolidated Financial Statements. Fuel Expense. Including regional carriers under capacity purchase agreements, fuel expense increased $468 million because of a 6% increase in our average price per gallon, despite a 2% decrease in consumption. The table below presents fuel expense, gallons consumed and our average price per gallon, including the impact of fuel hedge losses of $66 million during the year ended December 31, 2012: Year Ended December 31, Increase (Decrease) % Increase (Decrease) (in millions, except per gallon data) 2012 2011 Aircraft fuel and related taxes $ 10,150 $ 9,730 $ 420 Aircraft fuel and related taxes included within regional carrier expense 2,101 2,053 48 Total fuel expense $ 12,251 $ 11,783 $ 468 4 % Total fuel consumption (gallons) 3,769 3,856 (87 ) (2 )% Average price per gallon $ 3.25 $ 3.06 $ 0.19 6 % The table below shows the impact of hedging and the refinery on fuel expense and average price per gallon: Average Price Per Gallon Year Ended December 31, Increase (Decrease) Year Ended December 31, Increase (Decrease) (in millions, except per gallon data) 2012 2011 2012 2011 Fuel purchase cost $ 12,122 $ 12,203 $ (81 ) $ 3.23 $ 3.17 $ 0.06 Fuel hedge losses (gains) 66 (420 ) 486 0.01 (0.11 ) 0.12 Refinery segment impact 63 63 0.01 0.01 Total fuel expense $ 12,251 $ 11,783 $ 468 $ 3.25 $ 3.06 $ 0.19 MTM adjustments gains (losses) 27 (26 ) 53 0.01 (0.01 ) 0.02 Total fuel expense, adjusted $ 12,278 $ 11,757 $ 521 $ 3.26 $ 3.05 $ 0.21 35 Salaries and Related Costs . The increase in salaries and related costs is primarily due to employee pay increases, increases in pension expense and other benefits. During the June 2012 quarter, we reached an agreement with ALPA that increases pay and benefits for our pilots. Our pilots and substantially all other employees received base pay increases on July 1, 2012 and received additional increases on January 1, 2013. These increases are designed both to recognize changes to the profit sharing program described below and to accelerate the planned 2013 pay increase for non-pilot employees. Aircraft Maintenance Materials and Outside Repairs. Aircraft maintenance materials and outside repairs consists of costs associated with maintenance of aircraft used in our operations and maintenance sales to third parties by our MRO services business. The increase in maintenance costs is primarily due to the cyclical timing of maintenance events on our fleet. Additionally, maintenance cost increased as we accelerated certain maintenance events into 2012, resulting in a lower total cost for those activities, and completed maintenance initiatives to improve our operational reliability. Passenger Commissions and Other Selling Expenses. The decrease in passenger commissions and other selling expenses is primarily due to lower booking fees and international commission rates, partially offset by increases in sales. Contracted Services. Contracted services expense decreased year-over-year due primarily to the impact of severe winter storms on our operations in the March 2011 quarter. Profit Sharing. Our broad based employee profit sharing program provides that, for each year in which we have an annual pre-tax profit, as defined by the terms of the program, we will pay a specified portion of that profit to employees. In determining the amount of profit sharing, the terms of the program specify the exclusion of special items, such as MTM adjustments and restructuring and other items, from pre-tax profit. During the June 2012 quarter, our profit sharing program was modified so that we will pay 10% of profits on the first $2.5 billion of annual profits effective with the plan year beginning January 1, 2013 compared to paying 15% of annual profits for the 2012 plan year. Under the program, we will continue to pay 20% of annual profits above $2.5 billion. 36 Non-Operating Results Year Ended December 31, Favorable (Unfavorable) (in millions) 2013 2012 2011 2013 vs. 2012 2012 vs. 2011 Interest expense, net $ (698 ) $ (812 ) $ (901 ) $ 114 $ 89 Amortization of debt discount, net (154 ) (193 ) (193 ) 39 Loss on extinguishment of debt (118 ) (68 ) 118 (50 ) Miscellaneous, net (21 ) (27 ) (44 ) 6 17 Total other expense, net $ (873 ) $ (1,150 ) $ (1,206 ) $ 277 $ 56 The decline in interest expense, net is driven by reduced levels of debt and lower interest rates. Our principal amount of debt has declined from $15.4 billion at the beginning of 2011 to $11.2 billion at December 31, 2013 . During 2012 and 2011, we recorded $118 million and $68 million in losses from the early extinguishment of debt, which primarily related to the write-off of debt discounts. These debt discounts are primarily a result of fair value adjustments recorded in 2008 to reduce the carrying value of Northwest long-term debt due to purchase accounting. As a result of these write-offs and scheduled amortization, our unamortized debt discount has decreased from $935 million at the beginning of 2011 to $383 million at December 31, 2013 . Income Taxes We consider all income sources, including other comprehensive income, in determining the amount of tax benefit allocated to continuing operations. The following table shows the components of our income tax benefit (provision): Year Ended December 31, (in millions) 2013 2012 2011 Current tax benefit (provision): Federal $ 24 $ $ 91 State and local (3 ) 15 (6 ) International 1 (14 ) (2 ) Deferred tax provision: Federal 7,197 (4 ) 2 State and local 794 (13 ) Income tax benefit (provision) $ 8,013 $ (16 ) $ 85 During the December 2013 quarter, after considering all relevant factors, we concluded that our deferred income tax assets are more likely than not to be realized. Accordingly, at December 31, 2013, we released almost all of our valuation allowance against our net deferred income tax assets. The release of the allowance primarily resulted in a net tax benefit of $8.0 billion that was recorded in income tax benefit (provision) in our Consolidated Statement of Operations. Beginning in 2014, we expect to record income tax expense with an effective rate of approximately 38%. At December 31, 2013 , we had $15.3 billion of U.S. federal pre-tax net operating loss carryforwards. Accordingly, we believe we will not pay any cash federal income taxes during the next several years. Our U.S. federal pre-tax net operating loss carryforwards do not begin to expire until 2023 . See Note 12 of the Notes to the Consolidated Financial Statements for more information. During 2012 and 2011, we did not record an income tax provision for U.S. federal income tax purposes since our deferred tax assets were fully reserved by a valuation allowance. During 2011, we recorded an income tax benefit of $85 million, primarily related to the recognition of alternative minimum tax refunds. 37 Financial Condition and Liquidity We expect to meet our cash needs for the next 12 months from cash flows from operations, cash and cash equivalents, short-term investments and financing arrangements. As of December 31, 2013 , we had $5.7 billion in unrestricted liquidity, consisting of $3.8 billion in cash and cash equivalents and short-term investments and $1.9 billion in undrawn revolving credit facilities. Sources of Liquidity Operating Cash Flow Cash flows from operating activities continue to provide our primary source of liquidity. We generated positive cash flows from operations of $4.5 billion in 2013 , $2.5 billion in 2012 and $2.8 billion in 2011 . We also expect to generate positive cash flows from operations in 2014. Our operating cash flows can be impacted by the following factors: Seasonality of Advance Ticket Sales . We sell tickets for air travel in advance of the customer's travel date, and receive cash payment at the time of sale. As a result, we record the cash received on advance sales as deferred revenue in Air Traffic Liability. The Air Traffic Liability increases during the spring as we have increased sales in advance of the summer peak travel season. Our cash balances are typically higher at the beginning of the summer and at a low point during the winter. Fuel and Fuel Hedge Margins . The cost of jet fuel is our most significant expense, representing approximately 33% of our total operating expenses for 2013 . The market price for jet fuel is highly volatile and can vary significantly from period to period. This price volatility affects our cash flows from operations, impacting comparability from period to period. We have jet fuel inventories at various airport locations, which are used in our airline operations. Also, we acquired the Trainer oil refinery in 2012, which, as part of refinery operations, has refined oil product inventories. Jet fuel and refined oil product inventories are recorded as Fuel Inventory. Fuel Inventory increased during 2012 as a result of the start up of refinery operations in the September quarter and the transition of our fuel supply program. The increase in Fuel Inventory to achieve normal operating levels at our refinery was offset by a similar increase in accounts payable, and therefore, did not have a significant impact on operating cash flows during 2012. The remaining $180 million increase in Fuel Inventory was a result of the transition in Delta's fuel supply program. As part of our fuel hedging program, we may be required to pay hedge margin to counterparties when our portfolio is in a loss position. Conversely, if our portfolio with counterparties is in a gain position, we may receive hedge margin. Our future cash flows are impacted depending upon the nature of our derivative contracts and the market price of the commodities underlying our derivative contracts Timing of SkyMiles Sales. In December 2011, we amended our American Express agreements and agreed to sell $675 million of unrestricted SkyMiles to American Express in each December from 2011 through 2014. Under the December 2011 amendment, American Express purchased $675 million of unrestricted SkyMiles in each of 2013, 2012 and 2011. In 2011, this operating cash flow was largely offset by working capital changes. We anticipate American Express will make an additional purchase of $675 million of unrestricted SkyMiles in 2014. In 2008, we entered into a multi-year extension of our American Express agreements and received $1.0 billion from American Express for an advance purchase of restricted SkyMiles. The agreement, as modified, provided that our obligations with respect to the advance purchase would be satisfied as American Express uses the purchased miles over a specified future period ( SkyMiles Usage Period ). During the SkyMiles Usage Period, which commenced in December 2011, American Express utilized SkyMiles valued at $333 million annually over three years beginning 2012 instead of paying cash to Delta for SkyMiles used. This draw down of $333 million in SkyMiles reduced cash flows from operations in 2012 compared to 2011. In December 2013, we and American Express amended this agreement to allow American Express to use these SkyMiles immediately and without restriction. 38 Pension Contributions. We sponsor defined benefit pension plans for eligible employees and retirees. These plans are closed to new entrants and are frozen for future benefit accruals. Our funding obligations for these plans are governed by the Employee Retirement Income Security Act, as modified by the The Pension Protection Act of 2006. We contributed $914 million in 2013, including $250 million above the minimum funding levels, $697 million in 2012 and $598 million in 2011 to our defined benefit pension plans. We estimate the funding under these plans will total approximately $925 million in 2014, including $250 million above the minimum funding requirements. Undrawn Lines of Credit We have available $1.9 billion in undrawn lines of credit. As described in Note 8 of the Notes to the Consolidated Financial Statements, we have an undrawn $1.2 billion first-lien revolving credit facility, as part of our 2011 Credit Facilities. The revolving credit facility carries a variable interest rate and expires in April 2016. We also have an undrawn $450 million revolving credit facility included in the 2012 Pacific Facilities, as described in Note 8 of the Notes to the Consolidated Financial Statements. The 2012 Pacific Facilities are secured by our Pacific routes and slots. This revolving credit facility carries a variable interest rate and expires in October 2017. In addition, we have undrawn bank revolving credit facilities of $250 million. The credit facilities mentioned above have covenants, such as collateral coverage ratios. If we are not in compliance with these covenants, we may be required to repay amounts borrowed under the credit facilities and may not be able to draw on the revolving credit facilities. Other Our ability to obtain additional financing, if needed, on acceptable terms could be adversely affected by the fact that a significant portion of our assets are subject to liens. Investing and Financing Investing Activities We incurred capital expenditures of $2.6 billion in 2013 , $2.0 billion in 2012 and $1.3 billion in 2011 . Our capital expenditures were primarily for the purchase of aircraft and aircraft modifications that upgraded aircraft interiors and enhanced our product offering. Also during 2013, we purchased a 49% equity investment in Virgin Atlantic for $360 million . We have committed to future aircraft purchases that will require significant capital investment, and have obtained long-term financing commitments for a substantial portion of the purchase price of these aircraft. We expect that we will invest approximately $2.3 billion in 2014 primarily for aircraft and aircraft modifications. We expect that the 2014 investments will be funded through cash from operations and new financings. Financings At December 31, 2013 , total debt and capital leases, including current maturities, was $11.3 billion , a $1.4 billion reduction from December 31, 2012 and a $5.9 billion reduction from December 31, 2009. We have focused on reducing our total debt over the past few years as part of our strategy to strengthen our balance sheet. In addition, we have refinanced previous financing transactions, which we expect to reduce our total future interest expense. In May 2013, we announced a plan to return more than $1 billion to shareholders over the next three years. As part of this plan, our Board of Directors initiated a quarterly dividend program and declared a $0.06 per share dividend in both August 2013 and November 2013. These dividends were paid in September 2013 and November 2013 and each totaled $51 million . In addition, the Board of Directors authorized a $500 million share repurchase program, to be completed no later than June 30, 2016 . During 2013 , we repurchased and retired approximately 10 million shares at a cost of approximately $250 million . In 2013, we received $268 million in financing proceeds from long-term debt, which is secured by aircraft delivered in 2013. In 2012, we received $480 million in financing proceeds from long-term debt secured by aircraft previously financed by debt. In 2012, we also refinanced $1.7 billion in debt and undrawn revolving credit facilities secured by our Pacific routes and slots, which resulted in a lower interest rate. 39 Contractual Obligations The following table summarizes our contractual obligations at December 31, 2013 that we expect will be paid in cash. The table does not include amounts that are contingent on events or other factors that are uncertain or unknown at this time, including legal contingencies, uncertain tax positions and amounts payable under collective bargaining arrangements, among others. In addition, the table does not include expected significant cash payments which are generally ordinary course of business obligations that do not include contractual commitments. The amounts presented are based on various estimates, including estimates regarding the timing of payments, prevailing interest rates, volumes purchased, the occurrence of certain events and other factors. Accordingly, the actual results may vary materially from the amounts presented in the table. Contractual Obligations by Year (1) (in millions) 2014 2015 2016 2017 2018 Thereafter Total Long-term debt (see Note 8) Principal amount $ 1,491 $ 1,089 $ 1,472 $ 2,190 $ 2,159 $ 2,827 $ 11,228 Interest payments 510 440 370 290 230 460 2,300 Capital lease obligations (see Note 9) 165 158 143 100 54 74 694 Operating lease payments (see Note 9) 1,429 1,356 1,186 1,026 831 5,666 11,494 Aircraft purchase commitments (see Note 10) 1,585 1,215 1,700 1,495 450 2,700 9,145 Contract carrier obligations (see Note 10) 2,110 2,040 1,780 1,560 1,320 1,930 10,740 Employee benefit obligations (see Note 11) 810 760 690 670 650 8,260 11,840 Other obligations 790 580 530 390 430 1,420 4,140 Total $ 8,890 $ 7,638 $ 7,871 $ 7,721 $ 6,124 $ 23,337 $ 61,581 (1) For additional information, see the Notes to the Consolidated Financial Statements referenced in the table above. Long-Term Debt, Principal Amount. Represents scheduled principal payments on long-term debt. Long-Term Debt, Interest Payments. Represents estimated interest payments under our long-term debt based on the interest rates specified in the applicable debt agreements. Interest payments on variable interest rate debt were calculated using LIBOR at December 31, 2013 . Aircraft Purchase Commitments. Represents our commitments to purchase 88 B-737-900ER, 30 A321-200, 28 CRJ-900, 18 B-787-8 aircraft and 10 A330-300 aircraft. Our purchase commitment for 18 B-787-8 aircraft provides for certain aircraft substitution rights. Contract Carrier Obligations. Represents our estimated minimum fixed obligations under capacity purchase agreements with regional carriers. The reported amounts are based on (1) the required minimum levels of flying by our contract carriers under the applicable agreements and (2) assumptions regarding the costs associated with such minimum levels of flying. Employee Benefit Obligations. Represents primarily (1) our estimated minimum required funding for our qualified defined benefit pension plans based on actuarially determined estimates and (2) projected future benefit payments from our unfunded postretirement and postemployment plans. For additional information about our employee benefit obligations, see Critical Accounting Policies and Estimates. Other Obligations. Represents estimated purchase obligations under which we are required to make minimum payments for goods and services, including but not limited to insurance, marketing, maintenance, technology, sponsorships and other third party services and products. Additionally, other obligations includes estimates of lease payments on the remaining 75 B-717-200 aircraft still to be delivered in 2014 and 2015 from the agreements entered into in 2012 with Southwest Airlines and Boeing to lease 88 B-717-200 aircraft . 40 Critical Accounting Policies and Estimates Our critical accounting policies and estimates are those that require significant judgments and estimates. Accordingly, the actual results may differ materially from these estimates. For a discussion of these and other accounting policies, see Note 1 of the Notes to the Consolidated Financial Statements. Frequent Flyer Program Our frequent flyer program (the SkyMiles Program ) offers incentives to travel on Delta. This program allows customers to earn mileage credits by flying on Delta, regional air carriers with which we have contract carrier agreements and airlines that participate in the SkyMiles Program, as well as through participating companies such as credit card companies, hotels and car rental agencies. We sell mileage credits to non-airline businesses, customers and other airlines. The SkyMiles Program includes two types of transactions that are considered revenue arrangements with multiple deliverables. As discussed below, these are (1) passenger ticket sales earning mileage credits and (2) the sale of mileage credits to participating companies with which we have marketing agreements. Mileage credits are a separate unit of accounting as they can be redeemed by customers in future periods for air travel on Delta and participating airlines, membership in our Sky Club and other program awards. Passenger Ticket Sales Earning Mileage Credits. Passenger ticket sales earning mileage credits under our SkyMiles Program provide customers with two deliverables: (1) mileage credits earned and (2) air transportation. We value each deliverable on a standalone basis. Our estimate of the standalone selling price of a mileage credit is based on an analysis of our sales of mileage credits to other airlines and customers and is re-evaluated at least annually. We use established ticket prices to determine the standalone selling price of air transportation. We allocate the total amount collected from passenger ticket sales between the deliverables based on their relative selling prices. We defer revenue for the mileage credits related to passenger ticket sales and recognize it as passenger revenue when miles are redeemed and services are provided. We record the air transportation portion of the passenger ticket sales in air traffic liability and recognize these amounts in passenger revenue when we provide transportation or when the ticket expires unused. A hypothetical 10% increase in our estimate of the standalone selling price of a mileage credit would decrease passenger revenue by approximately $50 million, as a result of an increase in the amount of revenue deferred from the mileage component of passenger ticket sales. Sale of Mileage Credits. Customers may earn mileage credits through participating companies such as credit card companies, hotels and car rental agencies with which we have marketing agreements to sell mileage credits. Our contracts to sell mileage credits under these marketing agreements have multiple deliverables, as defined below. Our most significant contract to sell mileage credits relates to our co-brand credit card relationship with American Express. In September 2013, we and American Express modified our SkyMiles agreements. This modification required that we use a different accounting standard for recording SkyMiles sold. Prior to the modifications, we allocated consideration received from selling miles to American Express among two primary deliverables: credit redeemable for future travel and marketing deliverables. We deferred revenue related to the portion of mileage credits redeemable for future travel based on the rate at which we sell mileage credits to other airlines. We calculated the value of the marketing component based on the residual method and recognize it as other revenue as related marketing services are provided. The September 2013 modifications introduced new deliverables and modified existing deliverables. Because these modifications were material to the SkyMiles agreements, we are required to use a different accounting standard that allocates the consideration received from selling miles to all deliverables based on their relative standalone sales price. Accordingly, we determined our best estimate of selling prices by considering discounted cash flows analysis using multiple inputs and assumptions, including: (1) the expected number of miles awarded and number of miles redeemed, (2) the rate at which we sell mileage credits to other airlines, (3) published rates on our website for baggage fees, access to Delta SkyClub lounges and other benefits while traveling on Delta and (4) brand value. The effect of this change in accounting standard lowered the deferral rate we use to record miles sold under the agreements, which increases revenue we will record in future periods. The revenue impact of the SkyMiles agreement modifications was insignificant for 2013 and is expected to increase 2014 revenue by approximately $100 million . Additionally, upon application of this accounting standard, we were required to adjust the recorded value of miles currently deferred in our Frequent Flyer Liability that originated through the American Express programs. Accordingly, we adjusted the liability in the September 2013 quarter by less than $10 million . 41 Breakage. For mileage credits that we estimate are not likely to be redeemed ( breakage ), we recognize the associated value proportionally during the period in which the remaining mileage credits are expected to be redeemed. Management uses statistical models to estimate breakage based on historical redemption patterns. A change in assumptions as to the period over which mileage credits are expected to be redeemed, the actual redemption activity for mileage credits or the estimated fair value of mileage credits expected to be redeemed could have a material impact on our revenue in the year in which the change occurs and in future years. At December 31, 2013 , the aggregate deferred revenue balance associated with the SkyMiles Program was $4.4 billion . A hypothetical 1% change in the number of outstanding miles estimated to be redeemed would result in a $28 million impact on our deferred revenue liability at December 31, 2013 . Goodwill and Indefinite-Lived Intangible Assets We assess our goodwill and indefinite-lived intangible assets under a qualitative or quantitative approach. Under a qualitative approach, we consider many market factors, including those listed under Key Assumptions below. We analyze these market factors to determine if events and circumstances have affected the fair value of goodwill and indefinite-lived intangible assets. If we determine that it is more likely than not that the asset value may be impaired, we use the quantitative approach to assess the asset's fair value and the amount of the impairment. Under a quantitative approach, we calculate the fair value of the asset using the Key Assumptions listed below. If the asset's carrying value exceeds its fair value calculated using the quantitative approach, we will record an impairment charge for the difference in fair value and carrying value. When we evaluate goodwill for impairment using a quantitative approach, we estimate the fair value of the reporting unit by considering market capitalization and other factors. When we perform a quantitative impairment assessment of our indefinite-lived intangible assets, fair value is estimated based on (1) recent market transactions, where available, (2) a combination of limited market transactions and the lease savings method for certain airport slots (which reflects potential lease savings from owning the slots rather than leasing them from another airline at market rates), (3) the royalty method for the Delta tradename (which assumes hypothetical royalties generated from using our tradename) or (4) projected discounted future cash flows (an income approach). Key Assumptions. The key assumptions in our impairment tests include (1) our projected revenues, expenses and cash flows, (2) an estimated weighted average cost of capital, (3) assumed discount rates depending on the asset and (4) a tax rate. These assumptions are consistent with those hypothetical market participants would use. Since we are required to make estimates and assumptions when evaluating goodwill and indefinite-lived intangible assets for impairment, the actual amounts may differ materially from these estimates. In addition, we consider the amount the intangible assets' fair value exceeded their carrying value in the most recent fair value measurement using a quantitative approach. Changes in certain events and circumstances could result in impairment. Factors which could cause impairment include, but are not limited to, (1) negative trends in our market capitalization, (2) an increase in fuel prices, (3) declining passenger mile yields, (4) lower passenger demand as a result of a weakened U.S. and global economy, (5) interruption to our operations due to a prolonged employee strike, terrorist attack, or other reasons and (6) changes to the regulatory environment. We assessed each of the above assumptions in our most recent impairment analyses. The combination of our most recently completed annual results and our projected revenues, expenses and cash flows more than offset the impact of fuel prices and other airline input costs. The stabilizing operating environment for U.S. airlines has resulted in annual yields increasing along with load factors, leading to improved financial results. Goodwill. Our goodwill balance was $9.8 billion at December 31, 2013 . We determined that there was no indication that Goodwill was impaired based upon our qualitative assessment of all relevant factors, including applicable factors noted in " Key Assumptions " above. Identifiable Intangible Assets. Our identifiable intangible assets had a net carrying amount of $4.7 billion at December 31, 2013 . Indefinite-lived assets are not amortized and consist primarily of routes, slots, the Delta tradename and assets related to SkyTeam and collaborative arrangements. In 2013, we determined that there was no indication that our indefinite-lived intangible assets were impaired based upon our assessments. These assessments included analyses and weighting of all relevant factors, including the significant inputs and key assumptions which impact the fair value of our indefinite-lived intangible assets. 42 Long-Lived Assets Our flight equipment and other long-lived assets have a recorded value of $21.9 billion at December 31, 2013 . This value is based on various factors, including the assets' estimated useful lives and salvage values. We record impairment losses on flight equipment and other long-lived assets used in operations when events and circumstances indicate the assets may be impaired and the estimated future cash flows generated by those assets are less than their carrying amounts. Factors which could cause impairment include, but are not limited to, (1) a decision to permanently remove flight equipment or other long-lived assets from operations, (2) significant changes in the estimated useful life, (3) significant changes in projected cash flows, (4) permanent and significant declines in fleet fair values and (5) changes to the regulatory environment. For long-lived assets held for sale, we discontinue depreciation and record impairment losses when the carrying amount of these assets is greater than the fair value less the cost to sell. To determine whether impairments exist for aircraft used in operations, we group assets at the fleet-type level (the lowest level for which there are identifiable cash flows) and then estimate future cash flows based on projections of capacity, passenger mile yield, fuel costs, labor costs and other relevant factors. If an impairment occurs, the impairment loss recognized is the amount by which the aircraft's carrying amount exceeds its estimated fair value. We estimate aircraft fair values using published sources, appraisals and bids received from third parties, as available. Income Tax Valuation Allowance We periodically assess whether it is more likely than not that we will generate sufficient taxable income to realize our deferred income tax assets. We establish valuation allowances if it is not likely we will realize our deferred income tax assets. In making this determination, we consider all available positive and negative evidence and make certain assumptions. We consider, among other things, our future projections of sustained profitability, deferred income tax liabilities, the overall business environment, our historical financial results, our industry's historically cyclical financial results and potential current and future tax planning strategies. We recorded a full valuation allowance in 2004 due to our cumulative loss position at that time, compounded by the negative industry-wide business trends and outlook. At December 31, 2012, we had an $11.0 billion valuation allowance established against our deferred income tax assets, which represented a full valuation allowance against our net deferred income tax assets. For 2012, we recorded a pre-tax profit of $1.0 billion, and during 2012 we moved from a three-year cumulative loss position to a cumulative income position for the first time since we established the full valuation allowance. However given the industry's recent history of significant losses, we concluded as of December 31, 2012 that another year of significant profitability was needed to support a release of valuation allowance. During 2013, we continued our trend of sustained profitability, recording a pre-tax profit of $2.5 billion for the year. During the December 2013 quarter, after considering all relevant factors, we concluded that our deferred income tax assets are more likely than not to be realized. In evaluating the likelihood of utilizing our net deferred net assets, the significant relevant factors that we considered are: (1) our recent history of profitability; (2) growth in the U.S. and global economies; (3) forecast of airline revenue trends; (4) estimate of future fuel prices; and (5) future impact of taxable temporary differences. Accordingly, at December 31, 2013, we released almost all of our valuation allowance against our net deferred income tax assets, primarily resulting in the $8.0 billion benefit in our provision for income taxes. Defined Benefit Pension Plans We sponsor defined benefit pension plans for eligible employees and retirees. These plans are closed to new entrants and frozen for future benefit accruals. As of December 31, 2013 , the unfunded benefit obligation for these plans recorded on our Consolidated Balance Sheet was $10.1 billion . During 2013 , we contributed $914 million to these plans and recorded $354 million of expense in salaries and related costs on our Consolidated Statement of Operations. In 2014, we estimate we will contribute approximately $925 million to these plans, including $250 million of contributions above the minimum funding requirements, and that our expense will be approximately $230 million. The most critical assumptions impacting our defined benefit pension plan obligations and expenses are the discount rate and the expected long-term rate of return on the plan assets. 43 Weighted Average Discount Rate. We determine our weighted average discount rate on our measurement date primarily by reference to annualized rates earned on high quality fixed income investments and yield-to-maturity analysis specific to our estimated future benefit payments. We used a weighted average discount rate to value the obligations of 5.01% and 4.11% at December 31, 2013 and 2012 , respectively. Our weighted average discount rate for net periodic pension benefit cost in each of the past three years has varied from the rate selected on our measurement date, ranging from 4.10% to 5.70% between 2013 and 2011. Expected Long-Term Rate of Return. Our expected long-term rate of return on plan assets is based primarily on plan-specific investment studies using historical market return and volatility data. Modest excess return expectations versus some public market indices are incorporated into the return projections based on the actively managed structure of the investment programs and their records of achieving such returns historically. We also expect to receive a premium for investing in less liquid private markets. We review our rate of return on plan asset assumptions annually. Our annual investment performance for one particular year does not, by itself, significantly influence our evaluation. Our actual historical annualized three and five year rate of return on plan assets for our defined benefit pension plans was approximately 9% and 12% , respectively, as of December 31, 2013 . The investment strategy for our defined benefit pension plan assets is to use a diversified mix of global public and private equity portfolios, public and private fixed income portfolios and private real estate and natural resource investments to earn a long-term investment return that meets or exceeds our annualized return target. Our expected long-term rate of return on assets for net periodic pension benefit cost for the year ended December 31, 2013 was 9%. The impact of a 0.50% change in these assumptions is shown in the table below: Change in Assumption Effect on 2014 Pension Expense Effect on Accrued Pension Liability at December 31, 2013 0.50% decrease in weighted average discount rate +$1.1 billion 0.50% increase in weighted average discount rate -$5 million -$1.1 billion 0.50% decrease in expected long-term rate of return on assets +$50 million 0.50% increase in expected long-term rate of return on assets -$50 million Funding. Our funding obligations for qualified defined benefit plans are governed by the Employee Retirement Income Security Act. The Pension Protection Act of 2006 allows commercial airlines to elect alternative funding rules ( Alternative Funding Rules ) for defined benefit plans that are frozen. Delta elected the Alternative Funding Rules under which the unfunded liability for a frozen defined benefit plan may be amortized over a fixed 17-year period and is calculated using an 8.85% discount rate. While the Pension Protection Act makes our funding obligations for these plans more predictable, factors outside our control continue to have an impact on the funding requirements. Estimates of future funding requirements are based on various assumptions and can vary materially from actual funding requirements. Assumptions include, among other things, the actual and projected market performance of assets; statutory requirements; and demographic data for participants. For additional information, see Note 11 of the Notes to the Consolidated Financial Statements. Recent Accounting Standards Reporting of Amounts Reclassified Out of Accumulated Other Comprehensive Income Recently issued accounting guidance revises the reporting of items reclassified out of accumulated other comprehensive income and is effective for fiscal years beginning after December 15, 2012. We adopted this guidance in the March 2013 quarter and have presented amounts reclassified out of accumulated other comprehensive income in a note to the financial statements. For more information about accumulated other comprehensive income (loss), see Note 14. Presentation of Comprehensive Income In June 2011, the Financial Accounting Standards Board issued "Presentation of Comprehensive Income." The standard revises the presentation and prominence of the items reported in other comprehensive income and is effective retrospectively for fiscal years beginning after December 15, 2011. We adopted this standard in 2012 and have presented comprehensive income in our Consolidated Statements of Comprehensive Income (Loss). 44 Supplemental Information We sometimes use information that is derived from the Consolidated Financial Statements, but that is not presented in accordance with GAAP. Certain of this information is considered to be non-GAAP financial measures under the U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission rules. The non-GAAP financial measures should be considered in addition to results prepared in accordance with GAAP, but should not be considered a substitute for or superior to GAAP results. The following table shows a reconciliation of CASM (a GAAP measure) to CASM-Ex (a non-GAAP financial measure). We exclude the following items from CASM to determine CASM-Ex for the reasons described: Aircraft fuel and related taxes. The volatility in fuel prices impacts the comparability of year-over-year financial performance. The exclusion of aircraft fuel and related taxes from this measure (including our regional carriers under capacity purchase arrangements) allows investors to better understand and analyze our non-fuel costs and our year-over-year financial performance. Ancillary businesses . Our ancillary businesses include aircraft maintenance and staffing services we provide to third parties and our vacation wholesale operations. Because these businesses are not related to the generation of a seat mile, we exclude the costs related to these businesses from this measure to provide a more meaningful comparison of the costs of our airline operations to the rest of the airline industry. Profit sharing. We exclude profit sharing because this exclusion allows investors to better understand and analyze our recurring cost performance and provides a more meaningful comparison of our core operating costs to the airline industry. Restructuring and other items. Because of the variability in restructuring and other items, the exclusion of this item from this measure is helpful to investors to analyze our core operational performance in the periods shown. MTM adjustments. MTM adjustments are based on market prices as of the end of the reporting period for contracts settling in future periods . Such market prices are not necessarily indicative of the actual future value of the underlying hedge in the contract settlement period. Therefore, excluding these adjustments allows investors to better understand and analyze our costs for the periods reported. Year Ended December 31, 2013 2012 CASM 14.77 14.97 Items excluded: Aircraft fuel and related taxes (5.04 ) (5.32 ) Ancillary businesses (0.32 ) (0.38 ) Profit sharing (0.22 ) (0.16 ) Restructuring and other items (0.17 ) (0.20 ) MTM adjustments 0.12 0.01 CASM-Ex 9.14 8.92 45 Glossary of Defined Terms ASM - Available Seat Mile. A measure of capacity. ASMs equal the total number of seats available for transporting passengers during a reporting period multiplied by the total number of miles flown during that period. CASM - (Operating) Cost per Available Seat Mile. The amount of operating cost incurred per ASM during a reporting period. CASM-Ex - The amount of operating cost incurred per ASM during a reporting period, excluding aircraft fuel and related taxes, ancillary businesses, profit sharing, restructuring and other items and MTM adjustments for fuel hedges recorded in periods other than the settlement period. Passenger Load Factor - A measure of utilized available seating capacity calculated by dividing RPMs by ASMs for a reporting period. Passenger Mile Yield or Yield - The amount of passenger revenue earned per RPM during a reporting period. PRASM - Passenger Revenue per ASM. The amount of passenger revenue earned per ASM during a reporting period. PRASM is also referred to as unit revenue. RPM - Revenue Passenger Mile. One revenue-paying passenger transported one mile. RPMs equal the number of revenue passengers during a reporting period multiplied by the number of miles flown by those passengers during that period. RPMs are also referred to as traffic. 46
