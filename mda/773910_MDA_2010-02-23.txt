Item 7. Management Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations The following discussion should be read together with the Consolidated Financial Statements and the Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements , which are included in this report in Item 8, and the information set forth in Risk Factors under Item 1A. OVERVIEW Anadarko Petroleum Corporation is among the world largest independent oil and natural-gas exploration and production companies. Anadarko is engaged in the exploration, development, production and marketing of natural gas, crude oil, condensate and NGLs. The Company also engages in the gathering, processing, treating and transporting of natural gas. The Company operations are located in the United States, Algeria, Brazil, China, Cote d Ivoire, Ghana, Indonesia, Mozambique, Sierra Leone and several other countries. Anadarko achieved its key operational objectives in 2009 by increasing sales volumes by 7% year-over-year, while spending 35% less on near-term projects, reducing lease operating expenses per unit by more than 20% year-over-year, and adding 314 million barrels of oil equivalent (BOE) of proved reserves before price revisions and divestitures. Anadarko ended 2009 with approximately $3.5 billion of cash on hand and retains the availability of its undrawn $1.3 billion revolving credit agreement (RCA), along with access to credit markets. Management expects this liquidity position and cash flow from operations to position the Company to satisfy its 2010 operational objectives and capital commitments. MISSION AND STRATEGY Anadarko mission is to deliver a competitive and sustainable rate of return to shareholders by exploring for, acquiring and developing oil and natural-gas resources vital to the world health and welfare. Anadarko employs the following strategy to achieve this mission: identify and commercialize resources; explore in high-potential, proven basins; employ a global business development approach; and ensure financial discipline and flexibility. Developing a portfolio of primarily unconventional resources provides the Company a stable base of capital-efficient, predictable and repeatable development opportunities which, in turn, positions the Company for consistent growth at competitive rates. Exploring in high-potential, proven and emerging basins worldwide provides the Company with differential growth. Anadarko exploration success creates value by expanding its future resource potential, while providing the flexibility to manage risk by monetizing discoveries. Anadarko global business development approach transfers core skills across the globe to discover and develop world-class resources that are accretive to the Company net asset value. These resources help form an optimized, global portfolio where both surface and subsurface risks are actively managed. A strong balance sheet is essential for the development of the Company assets and the ability to manage through commodity price cycles. Maintaining financial discipline enables the Company to capitalize on the flexibility of its global portfolio, while allowing the Company to pursue new strategic and tactical growth opportunities. 33 Table of Contents OPERATING HIGHLIGHTS Significant 2009 operational highlights by area include: United States Onshore The Company Rocky Mountain region achieved total-year production of approximately 250 thousand barrels of oil equivalent per day (MBOE/d), representing a 15% increase over 2008. The Company reduced spud-to-spud cycle times in its onshore operating areas by 30% year-over-year relative to 2008. In the Marcellus shale, the Company spud 11 and completed six operated horizontal wells and participated in 40 new horizontal wells and 12 completions as a non-operating partner. Gulf of Mexico The Company Gulf of Mexico region achieved production of 151 MBOE/d, representing a 13% sales-volume increase over 2008. The Company announced five deepwater discoveries in the Gulf of Mexico at Heidelberg (44.25% WI), Shenandoah (30% WI), Samurai (33.3% WI), Vito (20% WI) and Lucius (50% WI). The Company declared four deepwater wells as dry holes and expensed approximately $27 million of additional well costs associated with properties that were pending further evaluation as of December 31, 2008. International The Company announced two deepwater discoveries offshore Ghana and one deepwater discovery in each of offshore Sierra Leone and Brazil. The Company announced successful appraisal wells offshore Ghana and Brazil. The Ghanaian government formally approved the Jubilee field Phase I Plan of Development and Unitization Agreement. Jubilee remains on schedule to achieve first production during the fourth quarter of 2010. All major contracts were awarded for development of the El Merk project in Algeria Block 208. First production is scheduled for late 2011. The Company declared two dry holes in Indonesia and one dry hole in each of Brazil, Cote d Ivoire, China, and Mozambique, and expensed approximately $22 million of additional well costs associated with properties that were pending further evaluation as of December 31, 2008. FINANCIAL HIGHLIGHTS Significant 2009 financial highlights include: The Company generated $3.9 billion of cash flow from continuing operating activities compared to $6.4 billion in 2008 due to lower average commodity prices for the year and ended the year with $3.5 billion of cash on hand. The Company completed two public debt offerings generating net proceeds of $2.0 billion, and repaid debt of $1.6 billion, including the repayment of $1.4 billion in aggregate principal amount of floating-rate notes due in 2009. The Company completed a public offering of 30 million shares of common stock at $45.50 per share generating net proceeds of approximately $1.3 billion. The Company reversed its $735 million accrued liability for potential royalties and interest related to the Deepwater Royalty Relief Act (DWRRA) dispute. 34 Table of Contents The following discussion pertains to Anadarko financial condition, results of operations and changes in financial condition. Unless noted otherwise, the following information relates to continuing operations and any increases or decreases for the year ended December 31, 2009 refer to the comparison of the year ended December 31, 2009, to the year ended December 31, 2008. Similarly, any increases or decreases for the year ended December 31, 2008 refer to the comparison of the year ended December 31, 2008, to the year ended December 31, 2007.

(3) Sales volumes for 2007 include 15 MMBOE associated with properties that were divested during 2007. 35 Table of Contents FINANCIAL RESULTS Income (Loss) from Continuing Operations Attributable to Common Stockholders Anadarko loss from continuing operations attributable to common stockholders for 2009 totaled $135 million, or $0.28 per share (diluted), compared to income from continuing operations attributable to common stockholders for 2008 of $3.2 billion, or $6.78 per share (diluted). Anadarko had income from continuing operations attributable to common stockholders in 2007 of $3.8 billion, or $7.99 per share (diluted). Sales Revenues Inc/(Dec) vs. 2008 Inc/(Dec) vs. 2007 millions except percentages 2009 2008 2007 Gas sales $ 2,924 (49 )% $ 5,770 43 % $ 4,043 Oil and condensate sales 4,022 (37 ) 6,425 19 5,407 Natural-gas-liquids sales 536 (33 ) 802 12 719 Gathering, processing and marketing sales 728 (33 ) 1,082 (27 ) 1,487 Total $ 8,210 (42 ) $ 14,079 21 $ 11,656 Anadarko sales revenues for the year ended December 31, 2009, decreased due to lower commodity prices, partially offset by increased production volumes. The increase for the year ended December 31, 2008, was due to higher commodity prices, partially offset by lower 2008 sales volumes, attributable to 2007 property divestitures. Analysis of Oil and Gas Operations Sales Revenues and Volumes The following table provides a summary of the effects of changes in volumes and prices on Anadarko sales revenues for the year ended December 31, 2009, compared to 2008 and 2007. millions Natural Gas Oil and Condensate NGLs 2007 sales revenues $ 4,043 $ 5,407 $ 719 Changes associated with sales volumes 303 (803 ) (63 ) Changes in prices 1,424 1,821 146 2008 sales revenues $ 5,770 $ 6,425 $ 802 Changes associated with sales volumes 454 155 154 Changes in prices (3,300 ) (2,558 ) (420 ) 2009 sales revenues $ 2,924 $ 4,022 $ 536 36 Table of Contents The following table provides Anadarko sales volumes for the year ended December 31, 2009, compared to 2008 and 2007. 2009 Inc/(Dec) vs. 2008 2008 Inc/(Dec) vs. 2007 2007 Barrels of Oil Equivalent (MMBOE except percentages) United States 196 9 % 179 (1 )% 180 International 24 (11 ) 27 (13 ) 31 Total 220 7 206 (2 ) 211 Barrels of Oil Equivalent per Day (MBOE/d except percentages) United States 537 10 489 (1 ) 492 International 67 (9 ) 74 (13 ) 85 Total 604 7 563 (2 ) 577 Sales volumes represent actual production volumes adjusted for changes in commodity inventories. Anadarko employs strategies to manage volumes and mitigate the effect of price volatility, which is likely to continue in the future. Production of natural gas, crude oil and NGLs is usually not affected by seasonal swings in demand. Natural-Gas Sales Volumes, Average Prices and Revenues 2009 Inc/(Dec) vs. 2008 2008 Inc/(Dec) vs. 2007 2007 (Percentages) (Percentages) United States Sales volumes Bcf 809 8 % 750 7 % 698 MMcf/d 2,217 8 2,049 7 1,912 Price per Mcf $ 3.61 (53 ) $ 7.69 33 $ 5.80 Gas sales revenues (millions) $ 2,924 (49 ) $ 5,770 43 $ 4,043 Bcf billion cubic feet MMcf/d million cubic feet per day The Company daily natural-gas sales volumes increased 168 MMcf/d for the year ended December 31, 2009, primarily due to increased production in the Rocky Mountain Region (Rockies) of 138 MMcf/d due to positive results from base production resulting from dewatering coalbed methane wells and higher production uptime due to favorable weather. An increase in production in the Gulf of Mexico of 54 MMcf/d related to favorable weather conditions as compared to hurricane-related downtime experienced during 2008. Also, runtime at Independence Hub increased during 2009 as compared to 2008 when export pipeline repair work resulted in downtime, partially offset by a decrease in production due to scheduled maintenance at Independence Hub. These increases were partially offset by a 24 MMcf/d decrease in the Southern Region resulting from natural production declines experienced while drilling programs were shifted from established fields to emerging shale plays. Anadarko daily natural-gas sales volumes increased for the year ended December 31, 2008, excluding 2007 divested property volumes of 156 MMcf/d. The increase was primarily due to higher sales volumes in the Gulf of Mexico of 175 MMcf/d as a result of the start up of the Independence Hub and increased production in the Rockies of 162 MMcf/d due to improved drilling efficiencies allowing for more overall drilling, partially offset by decreased production in the Southern Region of 44 MMcf/d. The average natural-gas price Anadarko received decreased for the year ended December 31, 2009. This decrease was primarily due to higher year-over-year natural-gas production and storage volumes coupled with lower United States demand for natural gas, triggered by the economic downturn in the United States. 37 Table of Contents Anadarko average natural-gas price increased for the year ended December 31, 2008. The increase was primarily attributable to lower year-over-year natural-gas storage volumes coupled with lower liquefied natural-gas volumes available to the United States consumer, both of which were caused principally by increased demand in both Europe and Asia. Crude-Oil and Condensate Sales Volumes, Average Prices and Revenues 2009 Inc/(Dec) vs. 2008 2008 Inc/(Dec) vs. 2007 2007 (Percentages) (Percentages) United States Sales volumes MMBbls 44 10 % 40 (17 )% 48 MBbls/d 120 11 108 (17 ) 130 Price per barrel $ 58.56 (39 ) $ 96.20 44 $ 66.88 International Sales volumes MMBbls 24 (11 ) 27 (13 ) 31 MBbls/d 67 (9 ) 74 (13 ) 85 Price per barrel $ 59.01 (38 ) $ 95.83 33 $ 71.86 Total Sales volumes MMBbls 68 1 67 (15 ) 79 MBbls/d 187 3 182 (15 ) 215 Total price per barrel $ 58.72 (39 ) $ 96.05 40 $ 68.83 Total oil and condensate sales revenues (millions) $ 4,022 (37 ) $ 6,425 19 $ 5,407 MMBbls million barrels MBbls/d thousand barrels per day Anadarko daily crude-oil and condensate sales volumes increased for the year ended December 31, 2009, primarily due to higher crude-oil sales volumes of 8 MBbls/d in the Gulf of Mexico and 3 MBbls/d in the Rockies. The increase in the Gulf of Mexico is attributable to additional production that came online during the fourth quarter of 2008, and favorable weather conditions as compared to 2008, which was impacted by export pipeline repair work and hurricane-related disruptions. The Rockies increase is attributable to production efficiencies related to an oil pipeline that was placed in service in 2009. These increases were offset by lower Algerian crude-oil sales volumes of 6 MBbls/d due to the timing of cargo liftings and variances in OPEC quotas. Anadarko daily crude-oil and condensate sales volumes decreased for the year ended December 31, 2008, excluding 2007 divested property volumes of 15 MBbls/d, primarily due to lower crude-oil sales volumes of 13 MBbls/d in the Gulf of Mexico attributable to pipeline repairs resulting from 2008 hurricane activity, lower crude-oil sales volumes of 7 MBbls/d in Algeria, primarily from lower production due to maintenance, a statutory shutdown and production constraints implemented by OPEC during the fourth quarter of 2008, and lower crude-oil sales volumes of 3 MBbls/d in Alaska, partially offset by higher crude-oil sales volumes of 5 MBbls/d in the Rockies. The average crude-oil price Anadarko received decreased for the year ended December 31, 2009, primarily due to increased spare OPEC production capacity coupled with decreased global demand, particularly in the United States, Europe and Japan as a result of the economic downturn. Anadarko average crude-oil price increased for the year ended December 31, 2008. Crude-oil prices were strong in the first half of 2008, primarily due to limited excess production capacity, heightened geopolitical tension and increased demand in Asia. 38 Table of Contents Natural-Gas-Liquids Sales Volumes, Average Prices and Revenues 2009 Inc/(Dec) vs. 2008 2008 Inc/(Dec) vs. 2007 2007 (Percentages) (Percentages) United States Sales volumes MMBbls 17 21 % 14 (13 )% 16 MBbls/d 47 21 39 (9 ) 43 Price per barrel $ 31.42 (44 ) $ 56.11 22 $ 45.87 Natural-gas-liquids sales revenues (millions) $ 536 (33 ) $ 802 12 $ 719 NGLs sales represent revenues from the sale of product derived from the processing of Anadarko natural-gas production. The Company daily NGLs sales volumes increased for the year ended December 31, 2009, primarily attributable to a new processing train placed in service during the second quarter of 2009 at the Chipeta natural-gas processing plant, increased gas production in the Rockies, and improved recoveries in the Southern Region. Anadarko daily NGLs sales volumes were down for the year ended December 31, 2008, primarily due to a 4 MBbls/d decrease associated with the 2007 divestitures. The average NGLs price decreased for the year ended December 31, 2009, primarily due to decreased global petrochemical demand as a result of the economic downturn. For the year ended December 31, 2008, average NGLs prices increased primarily due to increased global petrochemical demand for the first three quarters of 2008. NGLs production is dependent on natural-gas and NGLs prices as well as the economics of the processing of natural gas to extract NGLs. Gathering, Processing and Marketing Margin millions except percentages 2009 Inc/(Dec) vs. 2008 2008 Inc/(Dec) vs. 2007 2007 Gathering, processing and marketing sales $ 728 (33 )% $ 1,082 (27 )% $ 1,487 Gathering, processing and marketing expenses 617 (23 ) 800 (22 ) 1,025 Margin $ 111 (61 ) $ 282 (39 ) $ 462 For the year ended December 31, 2009, gathering, processing and marketing margin decreased $171 million. The decrease was primarily due to lower prices for natural gas, NGLs and condensate, which led to reduced gas processing margins, lower margins associated with firm transportation contracts due to price differentials between supply and market areas, and unrealized losses on derivatives related to gas-storage activity which is seasonal in nature, i.e. , the margin realized on the future sale of stored volumes covered by these derivative instruments will more than offset the recorded unrealized losses. These amounts were partially offset by increases in crude-oil marketing margins, and in NGLs marketing margins primarily due to inventory write-downs to market value taken in the fourth quarter of 2008. For the year ended December 31, 2008, gathering, processing and marketing margin decreased $180 million. The decrease resulted from lower marketing sales of $231 million primarily due to lower margins on firm transportation contracts and decreased third-party-marketing activity, a write-down of storage inventory due to lower commodity prices in the fourth quarter of 2008 and lower gathering and processing sales of $174 million, primarily due to lower volumes as a result of the 2007 divestitures. These amounts were partially offset by a $183 million decrease in costs associated with gathering and processing operations, primarily due to 2007 divestitures, a $39 million decrease in marketing transportation costs, and a reduction of accrued expenses related to a prior period of $29 million. 39 Table of Contents Gains (Losses) on Divestitures and Other, net Gains on divestitures in 2009 were $44 million, primarily related to proceeds from the sale of oil and gas properties in Qatar. Gains on divestitures in 2008 were $1.2 billion, primarily related to the divestiture of certain oil and gas properties in Brazil, onshore United States and the Gulf of Mexico. Gains on divestitures in 2007 related primarily to the Company asset-realignment program. During 2007, net gains of $4.1 billion related to divestitures of oil and gas properties and net gains of $574 million related to the divestiture of certain gathering and processing facilities. For additional information, see Operating Results Divestitures below . In 2008, gains (losses) on divestitures and other, net includes a net $82 million ($52 million after tax) reduction related to corrections resulting from the analysis of property records after the adoption of the successful efforts method of accounting. This net amount includes a reduction of $163 million related to 2007. Management concluded that this misstatement was not material to 2007 interim and annual results, or to the 2008 period, and corrected the error in the first quarter of 2008. Reversal of Accrual for DWRRA Dispute On March 17, 2006 Kerr-McGee Oil and Gas Corp (KMOG) filed a lawsuit styled Kerr-McGee Oil and Gas Corp. v. C. Stephen Allred, Assistant Secretary for Land & Minerals Mgt. and the Dept of the Interior (Kerr-McGee v. Allred) in the U.S. District Court for the Western District of Louisiana against the Department of the Interior (DOI) for injunctive and declaratory relief with respect to the DOI claims for additional royalties on the eight leases listed in the order issued by the DOI in 2006. In May 2007, KMOG filed a motion for summary judgment with the District Court for the Western District of Louisiana which ruled in favor of KMOG in October 2007. The DOI appealed the decision to the U.S. Court of Appeals for the Fifth Circuit (Fifth Circuit). In January 2009, a three-judge Fifth Circuit panel unanimously affirmed the District Court ruling in favor of KMOG. At the end of March 2009, the DOI filed a petition for rehearing by the full Fifth Circuit ( en banc ), which was denied on April 14, 2009. On July 13, 2009, the DOI filed a petition for a writ of certiorari with the U.S. Supreme Court, which was denied on October 5, 2009. Based on the U.S. Supreme Court denial of the DOI petition for review by the court, Anadarko reversed its $657 million accrued liability for royalties that could have been owed on leases listed in the 2006 Order, similar orders to pay issued in 2008 and 2009, and other deepwater Gulf of Mexico leases with similar price-threshold provisions. In addition, the Company reversed its $78 million accrued liability for unpaid interest on these amounts. Effective October 1, 2009, royalties and interest are no longer being accrued for deepwater Gulf of Mexico leases with price-threshold provisions. For more information on the DWRRA dispute, see Note 14 Contingencies Deepwater Royalty Relief Act in the Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements under Item 8 of this Form 10-K. Costs and Expenses millions except percentages 2009 Inc/(Dec) vs. 2008 2008 Inc/(Dec) vs. 2007 2007 Oil and gas operating $ 933 (15 )% $ 1,104 % $ 1,101 Oil and gas transportation and other 590 7 553 22 453 Exploration 1,107 (19 ) 1,369 51 905 For the year ended December 31, 2009, oil and gas operating expenses decreased primarily as a result of cost savings programs initiated in response to the reduction in oil and gas prices experienced from 2008 into 2009. Cost savings were achieved through operating efficiencies, deferral of certain workovers and vendor negotiations. Additional reductions were due to lower production handling rates in the Gulf of Mexico, and a decrease in outside-operated expenses in Alaska and Algeria. For the year ended December 31, 2008, oil and gas operating expenses increased primarily due to workovers and other field initiatives implemented to capture the increase in product prices from 2007 to 2008. Expenses for 2008 also included a full year of operations at Independence Hub. These amounts were partially offset by a decrease in costs associated with 2007 property divestitures. 40 Table of Contents For the year ended December 31, 2009, oil and gas transportation and other expenses increased due to incremental transportation fees paid on increasing volumes in the Rockies, new processing agreements in certain areas of both the Rockies and Southern Region and drilling rig contract termination fees paid during the year. These increases were partially offset by a decline in certain fees related to surface owner agreements and certain processing agreements that are tied to product prices. For the year ended December 31, 2008, oil and gas transportation and other expenses increased due to incremental transportation fees paid on increasing volumes in the Rockies, new processing agreements in certain areas of both the Rockies and Southern Region, a full year of demand fees at Independence Hub and an increase in certain fees tied to product prices. Exploration expense decreased by $262 million for the year ended December 31, 2009, primarily due to lower impairments of unproved properties of $205 million and lower geological and geophysical expense of $87 million. The decrease in impairments of unproved properties related primarily to Gulf of Mexico properties, partially offset by an increase in unproved property impairments in China. The decrease in geological and geophysical expense was primarily related to seismic data which was acquired and expensed in 2008 for Mozambique and Indonesia. Exploration expense increased by $464 million for the year ended December 31, 2008, primarily due to a $337 million impairment of unproved properties in the Gulf of Mexico, a $55 million impairment of unproved properties in Trinidad, a $40 million impairment of unproved properties in Brazil, and a $34 million increase in geological and geophysical costs, primarily related to the acquisition of seismic data for Mozambique. millions except percentages 2009 Inc/(Dec) vs. 2008 2008 Inc/(Dec) vs. 2007 2007 General and administrative $ 983 14 % $ 866 (7 )% $ 936 Depreciation, depletion and amortization 3,532 11 3,194 12 2,840 Other taxes 746 (49 ) 1,452 18 1,234 Impairments 115 (48 ) 223 NM 51 NM not meaningful For the year ended December 31, 2009, general and administrative (G&A) expense increased primarily due to bonus plan expense. The increase was primarily related to a supplemental bonus plan, the payment of which was triggered by the Company total-shareholder-return performance relative to a group of peer companies. The performance resulted in significantly increased market value relative to the peer-group-average performance, and all non-officer employees qualified for prescribed payments under the plan. For the year ended December 31, 2008, G&A expense decreased primarily due to a decrease in employee severance and termination benefits, lower compensation expense and a decrease in contract labor expense, partially offset by higher pension plan expenses. For the year ended December 31, 2009, depreciation, depletion, and amortization (DD&A) expense increased $338 million primarily due to a $237 million increase attributable to higher sales volumes and to $84 million of higher accumulated costs associated with acquiring, finding and developing oil and gas reserves. For the year ended December 31, 2008, DD&A expense increased $354 million primarily due to a $416 million increase attributable to oil and gas properties due to higher costs associated with acquiring, finding and developing oil and gas reserves. This increase was partially offset by a decrease of approximately $43 million due to lower sales volumes and a decrease in depreciation of other properties and equipment of $28 million primarily due to divestitures. For the year ended December 31, 2009, other taxes decreased primarily due to lower commodity prices, which resulted in lower United States production and severance taxes of $343 million, Algerian exceptional profits tax of $269 million, and Chinese windfall profits tax of $60 million as well as decreased ad valorem taxes of $32 million. For the year ended December 31, 2008, other taxes increased primarily due to increased production and severance taxes of $194 million, Chinese windfall profits tax of $55 million and ad valorem taxes of $43 million. These increases were triggered primarily by higher commodity prices and were partially offset by a decrease in the Algerian exceptional profits tax expense attributable to a change in the estimate of the 2006 exceptional profits tax recognized during the first quarter of 2007. Impairments for the year ended December 31, 2009, related to $86 million of marketing operating segment assets, $22 million of oil and gas exploration and production operating segment properties in the United States 41 Table of Contents and $7 million of midstream operating segment assets. The marketing operating segment impairments related to the impairment of firm transportation contracts and LNG facility-site properties. Impairments for the year ended December 31, 2008, related to $113 million of oil and gas exploration and production operating segment properties in the United States, $98 million of midstream operating segment assets and $12 million of marketing operating segment assets. The oil and gas exploration and production operating segment and midstream operating segment impairments were primarily a result of lower commodity prices at year-end 2008. The marketing operating segment impairments related to the impairment of firm transportation contracts.

The increase of $95 million was primarily related to foreign currency gains of $70 million primarily related to exchange-rate changes applicable to cash held in escrow pending final determination of the Company Brazilian tax liability attributable to its 2008 divestiture of the Peregrino field offshore Brazil. For 2008, the Company had total other expense of $52 million compared to total other income of $71 million for 2007. The decrease of $123 million was primarily related to lower interest income of $40 million due to lower average cash levels and lower interest rates in 2008, a $40 million loss related to environmental reserve adjustments and $54 million of impairment losses related to equity investments. Income Tax Expense millions except percentages 2009 2008 2007 Income tax expense (benefit) $ (5 ) $ 2,148 $ 2,559 Effective tax rate 5 % 40 % 40 % The variance between the Company effective tax rate and the 35% statutory rate in 2009 is primarily attributable to: the accrual of the Algerian exceptional profits tax, other foreign taxes in excess of the federal statutory rate, and U.S. residual income tax on foreign income. These amounts were largely offset by: benefits associated with changes in uncertain tax positions, state income taxes, including a change in the state income tax rate expected to be in effect at the time the Company deferred state income tax liability is expected to be settled or realized, and U.S. income tax impact from losses and restructuring of foreign operations and other items. The variance between the Company effective tax rate and the 35% statutory rate in 2008 is primarily attributable to the accrual of the Algerian exceptional profits tax, U.S. tax on foreign income, state income taxes and other items. In 2007, the variance from the 35% statutory rate is due to the Algerian exceptional profits tax, other foreign taxes in excess of federal statutory rates and state income taxes, partially offset by the foreign tax rate applicable to the Company divestiture of its 50% interest in the Peregrino field offshore Brazil, which had a rate lower than the 35% U.S. statutory rate, and other items. 43 Table of Contents Net Income Attributable to Noncontrolling Interests For the years ended December 31, 2009, and 2008, the Company net income attributable to noncontrolling interests was $32 million and $23 million, respectively. These amounts for the years ended December 31, 2009 and 2008 related primarily to a 43.2% and 36.7% average public ownership interest, respectively, in Western Gas Partners, LP (WES), a consolidated subsidiary of the Company. OPERATING RESULTS Segment Analysis Adjusted EBITDAX To assess the operating results of Anadarko segments, the chief operating decision maker analyzes income from continuing operations before income taxes, interest expense, exploration expense, DD&A expense and impairments, less net income attributable to noncontrolling interests (Adjusted EBITDAX). Anadarko definition of Adjusted EBITDAX, which is not a GAAP measure, excludes exploration expense because exploration expense is not an indicator of operating efficiency for a given reporting period. However, exploration expense is monitored by management as part of costs incurred in exploration and development activities. Similarly, DD&A expense and impairments are excluded from Adjusted EBITDAX as a measure of segment operating performance because capital expenditures are evaluated at the time capital costs are incurred. The Company definition of Adjusted EBITDAX also excludes interest expense to allow for assessment of segment operating results without regard to Anadarko financing methods or capital structure. Management believes that the presentation of Adjusted EBITDAX provides information useful in assessing the Company financial condition and results of operations and that Adjusted EBITDAX is a widely accepted financial indicator of a company ability to incur and service debt, fund capital expenditures and make distributions to stockholders. Adjusted EBITDAX, as defined by Anadarko, may not be comparable to similarly titled measures used by other companies. Therefore, Anadarko consolidated Adjusted EBITDAX should be considered in conjunction with income (loss) from continuing operations attributable to common stockholders and other performance measures prepared in accordance with GAAP, such as operating income or cash flow from operating activities. Adjusted EBITDAX has important limitations as an analytical tool because it excludes certain items that affect income from continuing operations attributable to common stockholders and net cash provided by operating activities. Adjusted EBITDAX should not be considered in isolation or as a substitute for an analysis of Anadarko results as reported under GAAP. Below is a reconciliation of consolidated Adjusted EBITDAX to income (loss) from continuing operations before income taxes.

The decrease in Adjusted EBITDAX for the year ended December 31, 2008, was primarily due to a decrease in gains on divestitures and other, net of $3.1 billion and lower sales volumes as a result of the 2007 divestitures, partially offset by the impact of higher commodity prices and higher natural-gas sales volumes primarily in the Rockies and the Gulf of Mexico. Midstream The decrease in Adjusted EBITDAX for the year ended December 31, 2009, resulted primarily from a decrease in revenue due to lower prices for natural gas, NGLs, and condensate, which impacted revenues earned under the Company percent-of-proceeds and keep-whole contracts, partially offset by lower cost of product. The decrease in Adjusted EBITDAX for the year ended December 31, 2008, resulted primarily from a decrease in gains on divestitures and other, net of $531 million and lower volumes as a result of the 2007 divestitures, partially offset by higher product prices and gathering rates. During July 2007, the Company divested its interests in two natural-gas gathering systems and associated processing plants. These divested facilities accounted for $75 million, or 21%, of Anadarko midstream segment Adjusted EBITDAX for 2007, excluding gains on divestitures. Marketing Marketing earnings represent primarily the margin earned on sales of gas, oil and NGLs purchased from third parties. The decrease in Adjusted EBITDAX for the year ended December 31, 2009, was primarily due to a decrease of approximately 30% in marketed third-party volumes, and lower margins associated with firm transportation contracts due to price differentials between supply and market areas. These amounts were partially offset by higher crude-oil marketing margins, and higher NGLs marketing margins primarily due to inventory write-downs to market value taken in the fourth quarter of 2008. The decrease in Adjusted EBITDAX for the year ended December 31, 2008, was primarily due to lower margins on firm transportation contracts and the write-down of storage inventory due to lower commodity prices in the fourth quarter of 2008. Other and Intersegment Eliminations Other and intersegment eliminations consists primarily of corporate costs that are not allocated to the operating segments, realized and unrealized gains and losses on derivatives and income from hard minerals investments and royalties. The decrease in Adjusted EBITDAX for the year ended December 31, 2009, was primarily due to realized and unrealized gains and losses on commodity derivatives, partially offset by realized and unrealized gains and losses on interest-rate swaps. The increase in Adjusted EBITDAX for the year ended December 31, 2008, was primarily due to realized and unrealized gains and losses on commodity derivatives, and decreases in employee severance and termination benefits, compensation expense and contract labor expense, partially offset by higher benefit plan expense and losses related to equity investments. Divestitures In 2009, Anadarko divested certain oil and gas properties, primarily in Qatar, onshore United States and other international properties for proceeds of $109 million and certain midstream properties for proceeds of $67 million. In 2008, the Company divested certain oil and gas properties, primarily in Brazil, onshore United States and the Gulf of Mexico for approximately $2.5 billion. Proceeds from 2008 divestitures were used to reduce debt. In April 2008, Anadarko entered into an agreement to sell its wholly owned subsidiary that owns an 18% interest in Petroritupano, S.A. (Petroritupano), a Venezuelan company also owned by Petr leos de Venezuela, S.A. (PDVSA) and Petrobras Energ a, S.A., for $200 million. The closing of this transaction was subject to customary closing conditions, including receipt of approvals by Venezuelan authorities. Anadarko was informed by the Venezuelan Ministry of Energy and Petroleum that it would not grant approval for the sale because PDVSA intends to acquire Anadarko interest in Petroritupano. Anadarko subsequently received a letter from Corporacion Venezolana del Petroleo, S.A. (CVP), an affiliate of PDVSA, in which CVP stated its interest in acquiring Anadarko ownership interest in Petroritupano. At this time, Anadarko is unable to determine when the sale to CVP will be completed. Anadarko investment in Petroritupano is included in other assets at December 31, 2009. 45 Table of Contents As a result of an asset-realignment program stemming from the acquisitions of Kerr-McGee and Western, Anadarko divested certain properties during 2007 for approximately $11.1 billion before income taxes. Net proceeds from these divestitures were used to reduce debt. For additional information, see Note 2 Divestitures and Other in the Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements under Item 8 of this Form 10-K. Proved Reserves Anadarko focuses on growth and profitability. Reserve replacement is a key to growth. Future profitability depends partially upon the cost of finding and developing oil and gas reserves. Reserve growth can be achieved through successful exploration and development drilling, improved recovery or acquisition of producing properties. The following is a discussion of proved reserves, reserve additions and revisions and future net cash flows from proved reserves. Additional reserve information is contained in the Supplemental Information on Oil and Gas Exploration and Production Activities (Supplemental Information) under Item 8 of this Form 10-K. MMBOE 2009 2008 2007 Proved Reserves Beginning of year 2,277 2,431 3,011 Reserve additions and revisions 275 188 252 Sales in place (24 ) (137 ) (620 ) Production (224 ) (205 ) (212 ) End of year 2,304 2,277 2,431 Proved Developed Reserves Beginning of year 1,600 1,625 1,989 End of year 1,624 1,600 1,625 Reserve Additions and Revisions During 2009, the Company added 275 MMBOE of proved reserves as a result of additions (purchases in place, discoveries and extensions) and revisions. The Company expects the majority of future reserve growth to come from positive revisions associated with infill drilling and extensions of current fields and new discoveries onshore in North America and the deepwaters of the Gulf of Mexico, as well as through improved recovery operations, purchases of proved properties in strategic areas and successful exploration in international growth areas. The success of these operations will directly impact reserve additions or revisions in the future. Additions During 2009, Anadarko added 70 MMBOE of proved reserves primarily as the result of successful drilling in the United States and at international locations. The Company also acquired 32 MMBOE of proved reserves in place related to onshore domestic assets in 2009. During 2008, Anadarko added 102 MMBOE of proved reserves primarily as the result of successful drilling in the Rockies and development and appraisal wells in the deepwater Gulf of Mexico. During 2007, Anadarko added 131 MMBOE of proved reserves. Of this amount, 130 MMBOE were a result of successful drilling in CBM and conventional plays of the Rockies and the initial recognition of proved reserves at the Peregrino field offshore Brazil. Revisions Total revisions in 2009 were 173 MMBOE or 8% of the beginning-of-year reserve base. The revisions included an increase of 212 MMBOE primarily related to large onshore natural-gas plays, such as the Greater Natural Buttes and Pinedale fields, as a result of successful infill drilling (where the reserve bookings for the infill wells are treated as a positive revision). The revisions include a decrease of 39 MMBOE driven by lower natural-gas prices. Total revisions in 2008 were 86 MMBOE or 4% of the beginning-of-year reserve base. The revisions included an increase of 188 MMBOE primarily related to Greater Natural Buttes, Wattenberg and Pinedale fields, as a result of successful infill drilling, and positive revisions to the Peregrino heavy-oil field, offshore Brazil, which was sold in 2008, partially offset by a decrease of 102 MMBOE related to prices for oil and NGLs. Total revisions for 2007 were 121 MMBOE, related primarily to infill drilling in large onshore natural-gas plays, and higher oil and natural-gas prices. 46 Table of Contents Sales in Place During 2009, the Company sold properties located onshore United States representing 24 MMBOE of proved reserves. In 2008, the Company sold properties located in the United States and Brazil representing 46 MMBOE and 91 MMBOE of proved reserves, respectively. In 2007, the Company sold properties located in the United States and Qatar representing 609 MMBOE and 11 MMBOE of proved reserves, respectively. Discounted Future Net Cash Flows At December 31, 2009, the discounted (at 10%) estimated future net cash flow from Anadarko proved reserves was $13.6 billion (stated in accordance with the new regulations of the Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC) and the Financial Accounting Standards Board (FASB)). This discounted future net cash flow was calculated based on beginning-of-month average prices for the year, held flat for the life of the reserves, adjusted for any contractual provisions. For reporting periods prior to December 31, 2009, year-end prices were used for calculating discounted future net cash flows. The increase of $1.6 billion or 13% in 2009 compared to 2008 is primarily due to positive performance from exploration and development programs. See Supplemental Information under Item 8 of this Form 10-K. The present value of future net cash flows does not purport to be an estimate of the fair market value of Anadarko proved reserves. A fair-value estimate would also take into account, among other things, anticipated changes in future prices and costs, the expected recovery of reserves in excess of proved reserves and a discount factor more representative of the time value of money and the risks inherent in producing oil and gas. LIQUIDITY AND CAPITAL RESOURCES Overview Anadarko primary sources of cash during 2009 were cash flow from operating activities and proceeds from the issuance of debt and common stock. The Company used cash primarily to fund its capital program, retire debt and pay dividends. Anadarko primary sources of cash during 2008 were cash flow from operating activities, proceeds from divestitures and the initial public offering of WES. In 2008, the Company used cash primarily to fund Anadarko capital spending program, retire debt, pay income taxes, repurchase Anadarko common stock, pay dividends and redeem preferred stock. Anadarko primary sources of cash during 2007 were proceeds from divestitures, cash flow from operating activities and proceeds from the issuance of a midstream subsidiary note to a related party. In 2007, the Company used cash primarily to retire debt, fund Anadarko capital spending program and pay income taxes and dividends. The Company has in place a $1.3 billion five-year RCA, entered into in March 2008 with a syndicate of United States and foreign lenders, and as of December 31, 2009, the Company had no outstanding borrowings under its RCA. Under the terms of the RCA, the Company can, under certain conditions, request an increase in the borrowing capacity under the RCA up to a total available credit amount of $2.0 billion. Anadarko was in compliance with existing covenants and the full amount of the RCA was available for borrowing at December 31, 2009. The Company continuously monitors its leverage position and coordinates its capital expenditure program with its expected cash flows and projected debt-repayment schedule. The Company will continue to monitor the financial markets and evaluate funding alternatives, including property divestitures, borrowings under the Company RCA and the issuance of debt or equity securities, based on its capital requirements. To facilitate a potential debt or equity securities issuance, the Company has the ability to sell securities under its shelf registration statement filed with the SEC in August 2009. The following section discusses significant sources and uses of cash for the three-year period ending December 31, 2009. Forward-looking information related to the Company liquidity and capital resources are discussed in Outlook that follows. Sources of Cash Operating Activities Anadarko cash flow from continuing operating activities in 2009 was $3.9 billion compared to $6.4 billion in 2008 and $2.8 billion in 2007. The decrease in cash flow from continuing operations for the year ended December 31, 2009, is primarily attributable to lower commodity prices, partially offset by higher sales volumes and realized gains on interest-rate derivatives. In December 2008 and January 2009, 47 Table of Contents Anadarko entered into interest-rate swap agreements with a combined notional principal amount of $3.0 billion. In May and June 2009, the Company revised the contractual terms of this swap portfolio to increase the weighted-average interest rate it is required to pay and realized $552 million in cash. The increase in cash flow from continuing operations for the year ended December 31, 2008, was attributable to higher commodity prices and lower income tax payments in 2008 compared to 2007, when income tax payments were substantially higher as a result of 2007 divestiture activity. This increase in cash flow was partially offset by the cash impact of lower 2008 sales volumes which decreased as a result of 2007 divestiture activity, and an increase in realized derivative losses in 2008. Fluctuations in commodity prices have been the primary reason for the Company short-term changes in cash flow from operating activities; however, Anadarko holds commodity derivative instruments that help to manage these cash flow fluctuations. Sales-volume changes also impact short-term cash flow, but have not been as volatile as commodity prices. Anadarko long-term cash flow from operating activities is dependent upon commodity prices, production sales volumes, reserve replacement and the level of costs and expenses required for continued operations. For additional information on the Company interest-rate swap agreements, see Note 8 Derivative Instruments in the Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements under Item 8 of this Form 10-K. Investing Activities During 2009, 2008, and 2007, Anadarko closed several property divestiture transactions, and received proceeds of approximately $176 million, $2.5 billion and $8.3 billion before income taxes, respectively. For additional information, see Operating Results Divestitures above. Financing Activities During 2009, Anadarko raised a total of $3.3 billion through the issuance of debt and equity as follows: millions Date Issuance Net Proceeds March 2009 7.625% Notes due 2014 $ 495 8.700% Notes due 2019 593 May 2009 Equity offering 1,337 June 2009 5.75% Notes due 2014 272 6.95% Notes due 2019 294 7.95% Notes due 2039 321 $ 3,312 During 2008, Anadarko raised $321 million in connection with the initial public offering of 20.8 million common units of its consolidated affiliate, WES. See Note 3 Noncontrolling Interest in the Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements under Item 8 of this Form 10-K. Proceeds from the offering were used to reduce debt. During 2007, Anadarko raised a total of $2.2 billion through the issuance of a midstream subsidiary note payable to a related party and an additional $2.8 billion through borrowings from affiliates. For additional information on the Company 2007 financing activities, see Note 6 Investments and Note 10 Debt and Interest Expense in the Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements under Item 8 of this Form 10-K. 48 Table of Contents Uses of Cash Capital Expenditures The following table presents the Company capital expenditures relating to continuing operations, by category. millions 2009 2008 2007 Property acquisitions Exploration unproved $ 279 $ 405 $ (293 ) Development proved 266 26 (591 ) Exploration 1,229 1,031 834 Development 2,886 3,530 2,805 Total oil and gas costs incurred* 4,660 4,992 2,755 Less: Corporate acquisitions and non-cash property exchanges (284 ) (106 ) 1,001 Less: Asset retirement costs (63 ) (263 ) (194 ) Less: Geological and geophysical, exploration overhead and delay rentals expenses and other (312 ) (344 ) (261 ) Less: Amortization of acquired drilling rig contract intangibles (5 ) (86 ) Total oil and gas capital expenditures 4,001 4,274 3,215 Gathering, processing and marketing and other 557 607 775 Total capital expenditures* $ 4,558 $ 4,881 $ 3,990 * Oil and gas costs incurred represent costs related to finding and developing oil and gas reserves. Capital expenditures represent additions to property and equipment excluding corporate acquisitions, property exchanges and asset retirement costs. Capital expenditures and costs incurred are presented on an accrual basis. Additions to properties and equipment on the consolidated statement of cash flows include certain adjustments that give effect to the timing of actual cash payments in order to provide a cash-basis presentation. Anadarko capital expenditures decreased 7% for the year ended December 31, 2009 primarily due to declines in development drilling expenditures onshore United States and expenditures on gathering and processing facilities. These declines were partially offset by an increase in development drilling expenditures in Ghana, exploration drilling expenditures onshore United States, property acquisition costs and capital expenditures related to the Company acquisition of its office buildings in The Woodlands, Texas. The Company capital spending increased 22% for the year ended December 31, 2008. The 2008 increase was due to an increase in development drilling expenditures primarily onshore in the U.S. and exploration lease acquisition activity primarily offshore in the U.S., partially offset by a decrease in expenditures related to construction, and gathering and processing facilities. Additionally, both 2008 and 2007 were impacted by rising service and materials costs. The mix of oil and gas spending reflects the Company available opportunities based on the near-term ranking of projects by net asset value potential. Property acquisitions in 2009 primarily related to exploratory non-producing leases onshore United States and proved property acquisitions related to property exchanges in the Rockies. Property acquisitions in 2008 primarily related to exploratory non-producing leases. Proved and unproved property acquisitions in 2007 include adjustments of $(600) million and $(484) million, respectively, related to finalizing the allocation of fair value to oil and gas properties acquired in connection with the acquisitions of Kerr-McGee and Western in 2006. See Outlook below for information regarding sources of cash used to fund capital expenditures for 2010. Debt Repayments At year-end 2009, Anadarko total debt was $12.7 billion compared to total debt of $12.3 billion at year-end 2008 and $14.7 billion at year-end 2007. In 2009, the Company repaid an aggregate principal amount of $1.6 billion of debt that was outstanding at December 31, 2008, including $1.4 billion in aggregate principal amount of Floating-Rate Notes due in 2009. In 2008, the Company repaid an aggregate principal amount of $2.4 billion of debt that was outstanding at December 31, 2007, including a variable-rate 354-day facility and $580 million in aggregate principal amount of Floating-Rate Notes due September 2009. 49 Table of Contents During 2007, Anadarko repaid $10.5 billion of indebtedness incurred in connection with its 2006 acquisitions of Kerr-McGee and Western. For additional information on the Company debt instruments, such as transactions during the period, years of maturity and interest rates, see Note 6 Investments, Note 8 Derivative Instruments and Note 10 Debt and Interest Expense in the Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements under Item 8 of this Form 10-K. Margin Deposits Both exchange and over-the-counter traded derivative instruments may be subject to margin deposit requirements. Exchange-broker margin requirements are determined by a standard industry algorithm, which requires a market-risk-based margin level be maintained on positions outstanding, from the date of trade execution through settlement. For derivatives with over-the-counter counterparties, the Company is required to provide margin deposits whenever its unrealized losses on derivative positions exceed predetermined credit limits. The Company manages its exposure to over-the-counter margin requirements through negotiated credit arrangements with counterparties, which may include collateral caps. When credit thresholds are exceeded, the Company utilizes available cash or letters of credit to satisfy margin requirements and maintains ample available committed credit facilities to meet its obligations. The Company working capital position and its RCA are sufficient to satisfy margin deposit requirements resulting from a significant increase in commodity prices or from entering into additional derivative positions. The Company had margin deposits outstanding and held cash collateral of $105 million and zero, respectively, at December 31, 2009. The Company had margin deposits outstanding and held cash collateral of $10 million and $3 million, respectively, at December 31, 2008. See Note 1 Summary of Significant Accounting Policies and Note 8 Derivative Instruments in the Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements under Item 8 of this Form 10-K. Common Stock Repurchase Program In August 2008, the Company announced a $5 billion share-repurchase program under which shares may be repurchased either in the open market or through privately negotiated transactions. The program is authorized to extend through August 2011. The program does not obligate Anadarko to acquire any specific number of shares and may be discontinued at any time. During 2008, Anadarko purchased 10 million shares of common stock for $600 million under the program through purchases in the open market and under share-repurchase agreements. During 2009 and 2007, no shares were repurchased under the programs in effect at those times. Dividends In 2009, 2008 and 2007, Anadarko paid $176 million, $170 million and $170 million, respectively, in dividends to its common stockholders (nine cents per share per quarter). Anadarko has paid a dividend to its common stockholders continuously since becoming an independent public company in 1986. The amount of future dividends for Anadarko common stock will depend on earnings, financial conditions, capital requirements and other factors, and will be determined by the Board of Directors on a quarterly basis. As of December 31, 2009, the covenants contained in certain of the Company credit and lease agreements provided for a maximum debt-to-capitalization ratio of 65%. The covenants do not specifically restrict the payment of dividends; however, the impact of dividends paid on the Company debt-to-capitalization ratio must be considered in order to ensure covenant compliance. Based on these covenants, as of December 31, 2009, the Company debt-to-capitalization ratio was 39% and retained earnings of approximately $13.3 billion were not limited as to the payment of dividends. The following table shows the Company debt-to-capitalization ratio. December 31, December 31, millions except percentages 2009 2008 Current debt $ $ 1,472 Long-term debt 11,149 9,128 Total debt excluding related party debt 11,149 10,600 Midstream subsidiary note payable to a related party 1,599 1,739 Total debt $ 12,748 $ 12,339 Stockholders Equity $ 19,928 $ 18,795 Debt-to-capitalization ratio 39.0 % 39.6 % 50 Table of Contents Outlook Anadarko mission is to deliver a competitive and sustainable rate of return to shareholders by exploring for, acquiring and developing oil and natural-gas resources vital to the world health and welfare. Anadarko employs the following strategy to achieve this mission: identify and commercialize resources; explore in high-potential, proven basins; employ a global business development approach; and ensure financial discipline and flexibility. Developing a portfolio of primarily unconventional resources provides the Company a stable base of capital-efficient, predictable and repeatable development opportunities which, in turn, positions the Company for consistent growth at competitive rates. Exploring in high-potential, proven and emerging basins worldwide provides the Company with differential growth opportunities. Anadarko exploration success creates value by expanding its future resource potential, while providing the flexibility to manage risk by monetizing discoveries. Anadarko global business development approach transfers core skills across the globe to assist in the discovery and development of world-class resources that are accretive to the Company performance. These resources help form an optimized global portfolio where both surface and subsurface risks are actively managed. A strong balance sheet is essential for the development of the Company assets, and Anadarko is committed to disciplined investments in its businesses to manage through commodity price cycles. Maintaining financial discipline enables the Company to capitalize on the flexibility of its global portfolio, while allowing the Company to pursue new strategic and tactical growth opportunities. The Company capital budgeting process is ongoing. The Company plans to allocate approximately 65% of its capital spending to development activities, 25% to exploration activities and 10% to gas-gathering and processing activities and other items. The Company expects capital spending by area to be approximately 40% for the U.S. onshore region, which includes the Lower 48 region and Alaska, 20% for the Gulf of Mexico, 30% for International and 10% for Midstream and other. The Company primary emphasis will be on managing near-term growth opportunities with a commitment to worldwide exploration and the continued development of large oil projects in Algeria, offshore Ghana and in the deepwater Gulf of Mexico. Anadarko believes that its expected level of operating cash flows and cash on hand as of December 31, 2009, will be sufficient to fund the Company projected operational and capital programs for 2010. However, if capital expenditures exceed operating cash flow and cash on hand, funds would likely be supplemented as needed through short-term borrowings under Anadarko fully available $1.3 billion RCA or through the issuance of debt or equity. In addition, to support 2010 cash flows, Anadarko has entered into strategic derivative positions as of December 31, 2009, on approximately 75% of its anticipated natural-gas sales volumes and approximately 70% of its anticipated oil and condensate sales volumes for 2010. In addition, the Company has entered into commodity-price-risk management derivative positions for the years 2011 and 2012. See Note 8 Derivative Instruments in the Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements under Item 8 of this Form 10-K. The Company may choose to refinance certain portions of its short-term borrowings by issuing long-term debt or equity under its shelf registration statement filed with the SEC in August 2009, or both. Also, the Company $1.6 billion midstream note contains credit-rating-downgrade triggers that would accelerate the maturity of this debt upon a downgrade of the Company unsecured credit rating to below BB- by Standard and Poor (S&P) or Ba3 by Moody Investors Service (Moody s). However, at December 31, 2009, the Company debt was rated BBB- with a stable outlook by S&P and Baa3 with a stable outlook by Moody s. Moreover, the Company access to its $1.3 billion RCA and cash on hand is sufficient to fund the repayment of the $1.6 billion midstream note. The Company continuously monitors its leverage position and coordinates its capital expenditure program with its expected cash flows and projected debt-repayment schedule. The Company will continue to evaluate funding alternatives as needed, including property divestitures or borrowings under the Company RCA and the issuance of debt or equity securities. 51 Table of Contents Credit Risks Credit risk is represented by Anadarko exposure to non-payment or non-performance by the Company customers and counterparties. Generally, non-payment or non-performance results from a customer or counterparty inability to satisfy obligations. Anadarko monitors the creditworthiness of its customers and counterparties and establishes credit limits according to the Company credit policies and guidelines. The Company has the ability to require cash collateral as well as letters of credit from its financial counterparties to mitigate its exposure above assigned credit thresholds. With respect to physical counterparties, the Company has the ability to require prepayments or letters of credit to offset credit exposure when necessary. The Company routinely exercises its contractual right to net realized gains against realized losses when settling with its financial counterparties, and utilizes netting agreements with physical counterparties where possible. Off-Balance Sheet Arrangements We may enter into off-balance sheet arrangements and transactions that can give rise to material off-balance sheet obligations. As of December 31, 2009, the material off-balance sheet arrangements and transactions that we have entered into include operating lease arrangements and undrawn letters of credit. Other than the off-balance sheet arrangements above, we have no transactions, arrangements or other relationships with unconsolidated entities or other persons that are reasonably likely to materially affect our liquidity or availability of or requirements for capital resources. See Obligations and Commitments for more information regarding off-balance sheet arrangements. Other In 2007, Anadarko contributed certain of its oil and gas properties and gathering and processing assets, with an aggregate fair value of approximately $2.9 billion at the time of contribution, to newly formed unconsolidated entities in exchange for noncontrolling mandatorily redeemable interests in those entities. Subsequent to their formation, the investee entities loaned Anadarko an aggregate of $2.9 billion, which the Company used to repay its 2006 acquisition-related debt. Anadarko has a legal right to setoff and intends to net-settle its obligations under each of the notes payable to the investees with the distributable fair value of its interest in the corresponding investee. Accordingly, the $2.9 billion aggregate principal amount of such notes does not affect Anadarko reported debt balance, since the notes and the carrying amount of Anadarko investments in the investees are presented on the consolidated balance sheet on a net basis. The related interest expense on these obligations and Anadarko equity earnings attributable to its investments in these entities are recorded in other income (expense), net. Note 6 Investments in the Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements under Item 8 of this Form 10-K provides additional information with respect to each of these transactions. Completion of these transactions resulted in Anadarko divesting control of its interests in certain non-core exploration and production and midstream assets and operations, while retaining a participating 5% interest in profits, losses and residual value of the investees. With respect to each investee, liquidation of the investee or redemption of Anadarko interest in the investee is expected to result in Anadarko net-settling in cash its obligation under the corresponding note payable with the distributable fair value of its interest in the investee. The Company does not currently expect such net settlement to have a material effect on its future financial condition, results of operations or cash flows. Each of Anadarko noncontrolling interests in the investees is optionally redeemable by Anadarko or the controlling investor in or after 2022 and is mandatorily redeemable in 2037. 52 Table of Contents Obligations and Commitments The following is a summary of the Company obligations as of December 31, 2009: Obligations by Period millions 1 Year 2-3 Years 4-5 Years More than 5 Years Total Total debt Principal current debt $ $ $ $ $ Principal long-term debt 1,877 775 10,257 12,909 Midstream subsidiary note payable to a related party 1,599 1,599 Investee entities debt (1) 2,853 2,853 Interest 756 1,371 1,181 7,877 11,185 Investee entities interest (1) 37 73 72 996 1,178 Operating leases Drilling rig commitments 807 1,372 291 2,470 Production platforms 61 108 105 249 523 Other 103 168 82 47 400 Asset retirement obligations 31 235 260 920 1,446 Midstream and marketing activities 190 328 227 310 1,055 Oil and gas activities 1,446 1,122 238 395 3,201 Derivative liabilities (2) 180 28 208 FIN 48 liabilities, interest and penalties (3) 5 28 12 45 Environmental liabilities 21 25 8 42 96 Total (4) $ 3,637 $ 8,334 $ 3,239 $ 23,958 $ 39,168 (1) Anadarko has legal right of setoff and intends to net-settle its obligations under each of the notes payable to the investees with the distributable fair value of its interest in the corresponding investee. Accordingly, the investment and the obligation are presented net on the consolidated balance sheet and included in other long-term liabilities other for all periods presented.

(3) See Note 16 Income Taxes in the Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements under Item 8 of this Form 10-K. (4) This table does not include the Company pension or postretirement benefit obligations. See Note 20 Pension Plans, Other Postretirement Benefits and Employee Savings Plans in the Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements under Item 8 of this Form 10-K. Operating Leases Operating lease obligations include several deepwater drilling rig commitments. Anadarko continues to manage its access to rigs in order to execute its worldwide deepwater drilling strategy over the next several years. The Company believes these rig commitments offer compelling economics and facilitate its strategy. The portion of lease payments associated with successful exploratory wells and development wells, net of amounts billed to partners, will be capitalized as a component of oil and gas properties. The Company also has $0.9 billion in commitments under noncancelable operating lease agreements for production platforms and equipment, buildings, facilities and aircraft. For additional information see Note 13 Commitments in the Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements under Item 8 of this Form 10-K. 53 Table of Contents Asset Retirement Obligations Anadarko is obligated to dispose of long-lived assets upon their abandonment. The majority of Anadarko asset retirement obligations (AROs) relate to the plugging and abandonment of oil and gas properties. The ARO is recorded at its estimated fair value, measured by reference to the expected future cash outflows required to satisfy the retirement obligation discounted at the Company credit-adjusted risk-free interest rate. Revisions to estimated AROs can result from changes in retirement cost estimates, revisions to estimated inflation rates and changes in the estimated timing of abandonment. Midstream and Marketing Activities Anadarko has entered into various transportation, storage and purchase agreements in order to access markets and provide flexibility for the sale of its natural gas and crude oil in certain areas. Oil and Gas Activities Anadarko has various long-term contractual commitments pertaining to exploration, development and production activities, which extend beyond 2010. The Company has work-related commitments for, among other things, drilling wells, obtaining and processing seismic and fulfilling rig commitments. The preceding table includes long-term drilling and work-related commitments of $3,201 million, comprised of $1,857 million related to the United States and $1,344 million related to international locations. The Company is obligated for approximately 27% of the construction costs of a floating production, storage and offloading vessel (FPSO) that will be used in the Company Ghana operations. Construction of the FPSO is expected to be complete in the first half of 2010. The Company share of total construction costs is estimated to be approximately $224 million. At December 31, 2009, the Company has accrued a net liability of $129 million representing Anadarko net share of construction costs incurred to date, less amounts funded by Anadarko through loans or other payments to the contractor of approximately $60 million. The Company obligation for construction costs is reported net of amounts previously funded as Anadarko has a contractual right to offset collection of the loans against the Company construction cost obligation. The Company remaining $35 million funding obligation is included in oil and gas activities in the preceding table. Marketing and Trading Contracts At December 31, 2009, the fair value of the Company marketing and trading portfolio of physical delivery and financially settled derivative instruments was $6 million. See Critical Accounting Estimates for an explanation of how the fair value for derivatives is calculated. Environmental Anadarko is subject to various environmental-remediation and reclamation obligations arising from federal, state and local laws and regulations. As of December 31, 2009, the Company balance sheet included a $96 million liability for remediation and reclamation obligations, most of which were incurred by companies acquired by Anadarko. The Company continually monitors the liability recorded and the remediation and reclamation process, and believes the amount recorded is appropriate. For additional information on environmental issues, see Risk Factors under Item 1A of this Form 10-K. For additional information on contracts, obligations and arrangements the Company enters into from time to time, see Note 8 Derivative Instruments, Note 10 Debt and Interest Expense, Note 13 Commitments, and Note 14 Contingencies in the Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements under Item 8 of this Form 10-K. Discontinued Operations In November 2006, Anadarko sold its wholly owned subsidiary, Anadarko Canada Corporation. The results of Anadarko Canadian operations have been classified as discontinued operations in the consolidated statements of income and cash flows for 2008 and 2007 primarily related to adjustments to an indemnity obligation provided by the Company to the purchaser, as well as expenses associated with finalizing exit activities. See Note 14 Contingencies in the Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements under Item 8 of this Form 10-K. CRITICAL ACCOUNTING ESTIMATES In preparing financial statements in accordance with GAAP, management makes informed judgments and estimates that affect the reported amounts of assets and liabilities as of the date of the financial statements and affect the reported amounts of revenues and expenses during the periods reported. On an ongoing basis, management reviews its estimates, including those related to the determination of properties and equipment, 54 Table of Contents proved reserves, goodwill, asset retirement obligations, litigation, environmental liabilities, pension liabilities and costs, income taxes and fair values. Changes in facts and circumstances or the discovery of new information may result in revised estimates and actual results may differ from these estimates. Management considers the following to be its most critical accounting estimates that involve judgment and discusses the selection and development of these estimates with the Company Audit Committee. Oil and Gas Activities Anadarko applies the successful efforts method of accounting to account for its oil and gas activities. Under this method, acquisition costs and the costs associated with drilling exploratory wells are capitalized pending the determination of proved oil and gas reserves. Geological and geophysical costs and other costs of carrying properties such as delay rentals are expensed as incurred. Acquisition Costs Acquisition costs of unproved properties are assessed for impairment during the holding period and transferred to proved oil and gas properties to the extent the costs are associated with successful exploration activities. Significant undeveloped leases are assessed individually for impairment, based on the Company current exploration plans, and a valuation allowance is provided if impairment is indicated. For unproved oil and gas properties with individually insignificant lease acquisition costs, costs are amortized on a group basis over the average lease terms at rates that provide for full amortization of unsuccessful leases upon lease expiration. Costs of expired or abandoned leases are charged against the valuation allowance, while costs of productive leases are transferred to proved oil and gas properties. Amortization of individually insignificant leases and impairment of unsuccessful leases are included in exploration expense. Significant undeveloped leasehold costs are assessed for impairment at a lease level or resource play (for example, the Greater Natural Buttes area in the Rockies), while leasehold acquisition costs associated with prospective areas that have had limited or no previous exploratory drilling are generally assessed for impairment by major prospect area. A majority of the Company unproved leasehold costs are associated with properties acquired in the Kerr-McGee and Western acquisitions in 2006 and to which proved developed producing reserves are also attributed. Generally, economic recovery of unproved reserves in such areas is not yet supported by actual production or conclusive formation tests, but may be confirmed by the Company continuing exploration and development programs. Another portion of the Company unproved leasehold costs are associated with the Land Grant acreage, where the Company owns mineral interests in perpetuity and plans to continue to explore and evaluate the acreage. A change in the Company expected future plans for exploration and development could cause an impairment of the Company unproved property. Exploratory Costs Under the successful efforts method of accounting, exploratory costs associated with a discovery well are initially capitalized, or suspended, pending determination of whether proved reserves can be attributed to the area as a result of drilling. At the end of each quarter, management reviews the status of all suspended exploratory drilling costs in light of ongoing exploration activities in particular, whether the Company is making sufficient progress in its ongoing exploration and appraisal efforts or, in the case of discoveries requiring government sanctioning, whether development negotiations are underway or proceeding as planned. If management determines that future appraisal drilling or development activities are unlikely to occur, associated suspended exploratory drilling costs are expensed. Therefore, at any point in time, the Company may have capitalized costs on its consolidated balance sheet associated with exploratory wells that may be charged to exploration expense in a future period. At December 31, 2009, suspended exploratory drilling costs were $579 million compared to $279 million at December 31, 2008. 55 Table of Contents Proved Reserves In December 2009, Anadarko adopted revised oil and gas reserve estimation and disclosure requirements which conforms the definition of proved reserves with the SEC Modernization of Oil and Gas Reporting rules, which were issued by the SEC at the end of 2008. The new accounting standard requires that the average, first-day-of-the-month price during the 12-month period preceding the end of the year, rather than the year-end price, be used when estimating reserve quantities and permits the use of reliable technologies to determine proved reserves, if those technologies have been demonstrated to result in reliable conclusions about reserves volumes. Prior-year data are presented in accordance with FASB oil and gas disclosure requirements effective during those periods; however, historical information has been reclassified to conform to the significant geographic areas required to be disclosed in 2009 under the revised accounting standard. Anadarko estimates its proved oil and gas reserves as defined by the SEC and the FASB. This definition includes crude oil, natural gas, and NGLs which geological and engineering data demonstrate with reasonable certainty to be economically producible in future periods from known reservoirs under existing economic conditions, operating methods, government regulations, etc., i.e ., at prices as described above and costs as of the date the estimates are made. Prices include consideration of changes in existing prices provided only by contractual arrangements, and do not include adjustments based upon expected future conditions. The Company estimate of proved reserves is made using available geological and reservoir data as well as production performance data. These estimates are reviewed annually by internal reservoir engineers and revised, either upward or downward, as warranted by additional data. Revisions are necessary due to changes in, among other things, reservoir performance, prices, economic conditions and governmental restrictions, as well as changes in the expected recovery associated with infill drilling. Decreases in prices, for example, may cause a reduction in some proved reserves due to reaching economic limits earlier. A material adverse change in the estimated volumes of proved reserves could have a negative impact on DD&A expense and could result in the recognition of an impairment. Fair Value The Company estimates fair value for derivatives, long-lived assets for impairment testing, reporting units for goodwill impairment testing, certain exchanges, guarantees, pension plan assets, the initial measurement of an asset retirement obligation, and assets and liabilities acquired in a business combination. When the Company is required to measure fair value, and there is not a market-observable price for the asset or liability, or a market-observable price for a similar asset or liability, the Company generally utilizes an income valuation approach. This approach is based upon management best assumptions regarding expectations of projected cash flows, and discounts the expected cash flows using a commensurate risk-adjusted discount rate. Such evaluations involve significant judgment and the results are based on expected future events or conditions, such as sales prices, estimates of future oil and gas production or throughput, development and operating costs and the timing thereof, economic and regulatory climates and other factors. The Company estimates of future net cash flows are inherently imprecise because they reflect management expectation of future conditions that are often outside of management control. However, assumptions used reflect a market participant view of long-term prices, costs and other factors, and are consistent with assumptions used in the Company business plans and investment decisions. Business Combinations Accounting for the acquisition of a business requires the allocation of the purchase price to the various assets and liabilities of the acquired business and recording deferred taxes for any differences between the allocated values and tax basis of assets and liabilities. Any excess of the purchase price over the amounts assigned to assets and liabilities is recorded as goodwill. Purchase Price Allocation The purchase price allocation is accomplished by recording each asset and liability at its estimated fair value. Estimated deferred taxes are based on available information concerning the tax basis of the acquired company assets and liabilities and tax-related carryforwards at the merger date, although such estimates may 56 Table of Contents change in the future as additional information becomes known. The amount of goodwill recorded in any particular business combination can vary significantly depending upon the values attributed to assets acquired and liabilities assumed relative to the total acquisition cost. Goodwill At December 31, 2009, the Company had $5.3 billion of goodwill recorded related to past business combinations. Goodwill is required to be assessed for impairment annually, or more often as facts and circumstances warrant. The first step in assessing whether an impairment of goodwill is necessary is to compare the fair value of the reporting unit to which goodwill has been assigned to the carrying amount of the associated net assets and goodwill. A reporting unit is an operating segment or a component that is one level below an operating segment. Anadarko has allocated goodwill to three reporting units. These reporting units are oil and gas exploration and production, gathering and processing, and transportation. As of December 31, 2009, these reporting units have a goodwill balance of $5.2 billion, $135 million and $5 million, respectively. During 2009, the Company changed its goodwill impairment testing date from January 1 to October 1. The Company completed its January 1, 2009, and October 1, 2009, annual goodwill impairment tests with no goodwill impairment indicated. Although Anadarko cannot predict when or if goodwill will be impaired in the future, impairment charges may occur if the Company is unable to replace the value of its depleting asset base or if other adverse events (for example, lower sustained oil and gas prices) reduce the fair value of the associated reporting unit. Because quoted market prices for the Company reporting units are not available, management must apply judgment in determining the estimated fair value of reporting units for purposes of performing the goodwill impairment test. Management uses all available information to make these fair-value estimates, including the present values of expected future cash flows using discount rates commensurate with the risks associated with the assets and observed for the oil and gas exploration and production reporting unit, and market multiples of earnings before interest, taxes, depreciation and amortization (EBITDA) for the gathering and processing and transportation reporting units. In estimating the fair value of its oil and gas reporting unit, the Company assumes production profiles utilized in its estimation of reserves that are disclosed in the Company supplemental oil and gas disclosures, market prices based on the forward price curve for oil and gas as of the test date (adjusted for location and quality differentials), capital and operating costs consistent with pricing and expected inflation rates, and discount rates that management believes a market participant would utilize based upon the risks inherent in Anadarko operations. For the Company gathering and processing and transportation reporting units, the Company estimates fair value by applying an estimated multiple to projected 2010 EBITDA. The Company considered the relatively few observable transactions in the market, as well as trading multiples for peers to determine an appropriate multiple to apply against the Company projected EBITDA for its gathering and processing and transportation reporting units. A lower fair-value estimate in the future for any of these reporting units could result in a goodwill impairment. Factors that could trigger a lower fair-value estimate include sustained price declines, cost increases, regulatory or political environment changes, and other changes in market conditions such as decreased prices in market-based transactions for similar assets. Based on our most recent goodwill impairment test, we concluded that the fair value of each reporting unit substantially exceeded the carrying value of the reporting unit. Therefore, no goodwill impairment was indicated. Impairment of Assets A long-lived asset other than unproved oil and gas property is evaluated for potential impairment whenever events or changes in circumstances indicate that its carrying value may be greater than its future net undiscounted cash flows. Impairment, if any, is measured as the excess of an asset carrying amount over its estimated fair value. The Company utilizes an income approach when market information for the same or similar assets does not exist. This fair-value approach requires us to use management best estimates, including asset production profiles and cost expectations, combined with inputs a market participant would use e.g. , prices and discount rates. 57 Table of Contents Derivative Instruments All derivative instruments, other than those that satisfy specific exceptions, are recorded at fair value. If market quotes are not available to estimate fair value, management best estimate of fair value is based on the quoted market price of derivatives with similar characteristics or utilizing industry-standard valuation techniques. The Company derivative instruments are either exchange-traded or transacted in an over-the-counter market. Valuation is determined by reference to readily available public data for similar instruments. Option fair values are measured using the Black-Scholes option-pricing model and verified by comparing a sample to market quotes for similar options. Unrealized gains or losses on derivatives are recorded within Anadarko current earnings. Benefit Plan Obligations The Company has non-contributory defined-benefit pension plans, including both qualified and supplemental plans, and a foreign contributory defined-benefit pension plan. The Company also provides certain health care and life insurance benefits for retired employees. Determination of the projected benefit obligations for the Company defined-benefit pension and postretirement plans impacts the recorded amounts for such obligations on the balance sheet, the amount of benefit expense recorded to the income statement, and the Company decision regarding amounts to be contributed to the plans. Accounting for pension and other postretirement benefit obligations involves numerous assumptions, the most significant of which relate to the discount rate used for measuring the present value of future plan obligations, the fair value and expected long-term rates of return on plan assets, rate of future increases in compensation levels and health care cost projections. Anadarko analyzes demographics and utilizes third-party actuaries to assist in the measurement of these obligations. Discount rate The discount-rate assumption used by the Company reflects the interest rate at which the pension and other postretirement obligations could effectively be settled on the measurement date. The Company currently uses a yield curve analysis to support the discount-rate assumption for the plans. This analysis involves the creation of a hypothetical Aa spot yield curve represented by a series of high-quality, non-callable, marketable bonds, then discounts the projected cash flows from each plan at interest rates on the created curve specifically applicable to the timing of each respective cash flow. The present values of the cash flows are then accumulated, and a weighted-average discount rate is calculated by imputing the single discount rate that equates to the total present value of the cash flows. The consolidated discount-rate assumption is determined by evaluation of the weighted-average discount rates determined for each of the Company significant pension and postretirement plans. The weighted-average discount-rate assumption used by the Company as of December 31, 2009, was 5.25% and 5.5% for pension plans and other postretirement plans, respectively. Expected long-term rate of return The expected long-term rate of return on assets assumption was determined using the year-end 2009 pension investment balances by category and projected long-term target asset allocations. The expected return for each of these categories was determined by using capital-market projections. The Company capital-market projection uses a forward-looking building-block approach and is not strictly based upon historical returns. Equity returns are generally developed as the sum of inflation, expected real earnings growth and expected long-term dividend yield. Bond returns are generally developed as the sum of inflation, real bond yield and risk spread (as appropriate), adjusted for the expected effect on returns from changing yields. Other asset class returns are derived from their relationship to the equity and bond markets. Consideration was also given to current market conditions. Anadarko expected long-term rate of return is expected to be fairly consistent from year to year; however, it may change due to changes in asset-allocation targets, changes in financial market conditions and changes in the general economic outlook. The weighted-average expected long-term rate of return on plan assets assumption used by the Company as of December 31, 2009, was 7.5%. 58 Table of Contents Rate of compensation increases The Company assumption is based on its long-term plans for compensation increases specific to covered employee groups and expected economic conditions. The assumed rate of salary increases includes the effects of merit increases, promotions and general inflation. The weighted-average rate of increase in long-term compensation levels assumption used by the Company as of December 31, 2009, was 5.0%. Health care cost trend rate The health care cost trend assumptions are developed based on historical cost data, the near-term outlook and an assessment of likely long-term trends. A 9.0% annual rate of increase in the per-capita cost of covered health care benefits was assumed for 2010, decreasing gradually to 5.0% in 2018 and later years. Environmental Obligations and Other Contingencies Management makes judgments and estimates in accordance with applicable accounting rules when it establishes reserves for environmental remediation, litigation and other contingent matters. Provisions for such matters are charged to expense when it is probable that a liability has been incurred and reasonable estimates of the liability can be made. Estimates of environmental liabilities are based on a variety of matters, including, but not limited to, the stage of investigation, the stage of the remedial design, evaluation of existing remediation technologies, and presently enacted laws and regulations. In future periods, a number of factors could significantly change the Company estimate of environmental-remediation costs, such as changes in laws and regulations, changes in the interpretation or administration of laws and regulations, revisions to the remedial design, unanticipated construction problems, identification of additional areas or volumes of contaminated soil and groundwater, and changes in costs of labor, equipment and technology. Consequently, it is not possible for management to reliably estimate the amount and timing of all future expenditures related to environmental or other contingent matters and actual costs may vary significantly from the Company estimates. The Company in-house legal counsel and environmental personnel regularly assess these contingent liabilities and, in certain circumstances, third-party legal counsel or consultants are utilized. Income Taxes The amount of income taxes recorded by the Company requires interpretations of complex rules and regulations of various tax jurisdictions throughout the world. The Company has recognized deferred tax assets and liabilities for temporary differences, operating losses and tax credit carryforwards. The Company routinely assesses the realizability of its deferred tax assets and reduces such assets by a valuation allowance if it is more likely than not that some portion or all of the deferred tax assets will not be realized. The Company routinely assesses potential uncertain tax positions and, if required, establishes accruals for such amounts. The accruals for deferred tax assets and liabilities are subject to a significant amount of judgment by Company management and are reviewed and adjusted routinely based on changes in facts and circumstances. Although management considers its tax accruals adequate, material changes in these accruals may occur in the future, based on the progress of ongoing tax audits, changes in legislation and resolution of pending tax matters. 59 Table of Contents RECENT ACCOUNTING DEVELOPMENTS In June 2009, the FASB issued amendments to the consolidation standard applicable to variable interest entities. The amendments significantly reduce the previously required quantitative consolidation analysis, and require ongoing reassessments of whether the Company is the primary beneficiary of a variable interest entity. This standard is effective for the Company on January 1, 2010. The adoption of this standard will not have an impact on the Company consolidated financial position, results of operations or cash flows. In January 2010, the FASB adopted changes to the definition of proved reserves, requiring proved reserves to be computed using the average, first-day-of-the-month price during the 12-month period before the end of the year, as well as allowing the use of reliable technology in determining estimates of proved reserves. These new reserve estimates will be used in determining depletion expense for the Company oil and gas properties beginning January 1, 2010. Adoption of these new definitions will not have a material impact on depletion expense recorded in future periods. For additional information on recently issued accounting standards not yet adopted, see Note 1 Summary of Significant Accounting Policies in the Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements under Item 8 of this Form 10-K. 60 Table of Contents
