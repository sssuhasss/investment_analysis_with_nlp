ITEM 7. MANAGEMENT S DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS OF FINANCIAL CONDITION AND RESULTS OF OPERATIONS Management Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations ( MD&A ) is intended to help provide an understanding of our business and results of operations. This MD&A should be read in conjunction with our Consolidated Financial Statements and the accompanying Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements included elsewhere in this report. This report, including the following MD&A, contains forward-looking statements regarding future events or trends as described more fully under Forward-Looking Statements on page 55 of this report. Actual results or developments could differ materially from those projected in such statements as a result of the risk factors described in Item 1a, Risk Factors, of this report. Executive Overview Business Description We are primarily engaged in developing, acquiring, owning and operating apartment communities in high barrier-to-entry markets of the United States. We believe that apartment communities are an attractive long-term investment opportunity compared to other real estate investments because a broad potential resident base should help reduce demand volatility over a real estate cycle. However, throughout the real estate cycle, apartment market fundamentals, and therefore operating cash flows, are affected by overall economic conditions. We seek to create long-term shareholder value by accessing capital on cost effective terms; deploying that capital to develop, redevelop and acquire apartment communities in high barrier-to-entry markets; operating apartment communities; and selling communities when they no longer meet our long-term investment strategy or when pricing is attractive. Barriers-to-entry in our markets generally include a difficult and lengthy entitlement process with local jurisdictions and dense urban or suburban areas where zoned and entitled land is in limited supply. We regularly evaluate the allocation of our investments by the amount of invested capital and by product type within our individual markets, which are located in the Northeast, Mid-Atlantic, Midwest, Pacific Northwest, and Northern and Southern California regions of the United States. Our strategy is to more deeply penetrate these markets with a broad range of products and services and an intense focus on our customer. Our communities are predominately upscale, which generally command among the highest rents in their markets. However, we also pursue the ownership and operation of apartment communities that target a variety of customer segments and price points, consistent with our goal of offering a broad range of products and services. Financial Highlights and Outlook Net income available to common stockholders for the quarter ended December 31, 2007 was $129,644,000, as compared to $44,138,000 for the quarter ended December 31, 2006, an increase of 193.7%. For the year ended December 31, 2007, net income available to common stockholders was $349,460,000 compared to $257,846,000 for 2006, an increase of 35.5%. These increases are primarily attributable to an increase in gains from the sale of communities and joint venture real estate investments in 2007 as compared to 2006 and growth in income from existing and newly developed communities in 2007. Apartment fundamentals remained positive in 2007 as evidenced by full year-over-year rental revenue growth of 5.5% achieved within our Established Community portfolio (as defined later in this report), comprised of an increase in rental rates of 5.8% and a decrease in occupancy of 0.3%. This revenue growth combined with constrained expense growth contributed to our Established Community portfolio achieving year-over-year growth in net operating income ( NOI ) of 7.2% in 2007. For the fourth quarter of 2007, our Established Communities experienced an increase in rental revenue of 4.4% and a corresponding increase in NOI of 4.9% over the prior year period, evidencing the moderating, but continued growth in operations. Projected growth in earnings per share diluted ( EPS ) in our current financial outlook is expected to be between 48.4% and 94.1% driven primarily by gains on the sale of communities that may occur under our expanded disposition program. In addition, we expect that our Established Communities will continue to show revenue and net operating income growth in 2008, but at a lesser rate relative to growth levels in 2007. Despite third party forecasts of a weaker economic environment, we anticipate positive renter demand resulting from a continued reduction in homeownership rates and a general increase in the propensity to rent. Declining home ownership rates are the result of a number of factors, including concerns regarding home prices and economic growth, demographic growth in those age groups that have historically demonstrated a higher propensity to rent as well as tighter underwriting standards for mortgages. Management expects the level of new rental completions in the Company markets will decline modestly during 2008 from 2007 levels and competition from unsold housing inventory made available for rent will remain modest relative to more oversupplied residential markets in the U.S. Overall we expect apartment market fundamentals will be balanced in our markets, supporting moderate growth in earnings. Our current financial outlook provides for 2008 rental growth of 2.5% to 4.0% in our established community portfolio and projected NOI growth of 3.0% to 4.5% 40 We expect that our development activity will continue to create long-term value. We currently have approximately $2,162,500,000 under construction (measured by total projected capitalized cost of the communities at completion, including the portions in which joint venture partners hold an equity or economic interest). For 2008, we expect new development starts in the range of $900,000,000 to $1,100,000,000 measured at projected cost of completion, including projects that may be developed through joint ventures. This is a decrease in new activity from 2007 reflecting the current economic and capital market conditions. We continue to be selective in pursuing new development opportunities. Land prices generally have not re-set in most of our markets, but we are seeing construction cost increases stabilizing. Construction costs for certain materials have begun to decline while prices for other materials remain high given strong global demand. There is also greater availability of experienced subcontractors and trade professionals as a result of slowing construction in both the condominium and single-family housing markets. We continue to selectively secure new Development Rights, including the acquisition of land for future development. We currently have Development Rights for construction of new apartment communities that would, if developed as expected, total approximately $3,918,000,000 based on total projected capitalized costs at December 31, 2007. We also expect to increase our redevelopment activities in 2008, for both wholly owned and Fund (as defined below) related assets. While current market conditions with respect to liquidity may impact the types of funding sources used, we believe that our current level of indebtedness, our current ability to service interest and other fixed charges and our current limited use of financial encumbrances (such as secured financing) on our assets provide us with the financial position and financial flexibility to access the capital necessary to fund our development and redevelopment activities. We expect to meet these needs from both secured and unsecured debt, as well as asset sales and retained cash. AvalonBay Value Added Fund, L.P. (the Fund ) is a discretionary investment fund in which we hold a 15% interest. The Fund has been our principal vehicle for acquiring apartment communities, subject to certain exceptions, since its formation in March 2005. The Fund acquired seven communities for an aggregate purchase price of $305,450,000 during 2007. As of January 31, 2008, the total amount invested by the Fund is $779,318,000. Management of the Fund expects to invest approximately $39,000,000 of additional funds to redevelop the assets acquired, at which time, the Fund will become fully invested. We are exploring various potential sources and vehicles for funding future acquisitions after the Fund is fully invested. We continue to see real estate capital flows from income investors. In 2007, we completed the disposition of four communities and one partnership interest for an aggregate gross sales price of $268,096,000. Given the current levels of demand from investors for high quality multifamily real estate assets, we anticipate increasing our level of disposition activity to a range of $700,000,000 to $1,000,000,000 in 2008. Actual disposition activity will depend on various factors including market and economic conditions. Communities Overview Our real estate investments consist primarily of current operating apartment communities, communities in various stages of development ( Development Communities ) and Development Rights (i.e., land or options to purchase land held for development), as further described in Item 2 of this report. Our current operating communities are further distinguished as Established Communities, Other Stabilized Communities, Lease-Up Communities and Redevelopment Communities. Established Communities are generally operating communities that are consolidated for financial reporting purposes and were owned and had stabilized occupancy and operating expenses as of the beginning of the prior year, which allows the performance of these communities and the markets in which they are located to be compared and monitored between years. Other Stabilized Communities are generally all other consolidated operating communities that have stabilized occupancy and operating expenses during the current year, but had not achieved stabilization as of the beginning of the prior year. Lease-Up Communities consist of communities where construction is complete but stabilization has not been achieved. Redevelopment Communities consist of communities where substantial redevelopment is in progress or is planned to begin during the current year. A more detailed description of our reportable segments and other related operating information can be found in Note 9, Segment Reporting, of our Consolidated Financial Statements. 41 Although each of these categories is important to our business, we generally evaluate overall operating, industry and market trends based on the operating results of Established Communities, for which a detailed discussion can be found in Results of Operations as part of our discussion of overall operating results. We evaluate our current and future cash needs and future operating potential based on acquisition, disposition, development, redevelopment and financing activities within Other Stabilized, Redevelopment and Development Communities, and discussions related to these segments of our business can be found in Liquidity and Capital Resources. The net operating income of our current operating communities, as defined later in this report, is one of the financial measures that we use to evaluate community performance. Net operating income is affected by the demand and supply dynamics within our markets, our rental rates and occupancy levels, and our ability to control operating costs. Our overall financial performance is also impacted by the general availability and cost of capital and the performance of newly developed and acquired apartment communities. As of December 31, 2007, we owned or held a direct or indirect ownership interest in 184 apartment communities containing 52,748 apartment homes in ten states and the District of Columbia, of which 21 communities were under construction and eight communities were under reconstruction. Of these communities, 23 were owned by entities that were not consolidated for financial reporting purposes, including 20 owned by the Fund. In addition, we owned a direct or indirect ownership interest in Development Rights to develop an additional 48 communities that, if developed in the manner expected, will contain an estimated 13,656 apartment homes. Results of Operations Our year-over-year operating performance is primarily affected by individual geographic market conditions and apartment fundamentals as measured by changes in net operating income of our Established Communities; net operating income derived from acquisitions and development completions; the loss of net operating income related to disposed communities; and capital market, disposition and financing activity.

Net income available to common stockholders decreased $43,922,000, or 14.6%, to $257,846,000 in 2006, primarily attributable to reduced asset sales and the related gains, partially offset by growth in net operating income from Established Communities and contributions to net operating income from newly developed communities. Net operating income ( NOI ) is considered by management to be an important and appropriate supplemental performance measure to net income because it helps both investors and management to understand the core operations of a community or communities prior to the allocation of any corporate-level or financing-related costs. NOI reflects the operating performance of a community and allows for an easy comparison of the operating performance of individual assets or groups of assets. In addition, because prospective buyers of real estate have different financing and overhead structures, with varying marginal impacts to overhead by acquiring real estate, NOI is considered by many in the real estate industry to be a useful measure for determining the value of a real estate asset or group of assets. We define NOI as total property revenue less direct property operating expenses, including property taxes. NOI does not represent cash generated from operating activities in accordance with U.S. generally accepted accounting principles ( GAAP ). Therefore, NOI should not be considered an alternative to net income as an indication of our performance. NOI should also not be considered an alternative to net cash flow from operating activities, as determined by GAAP, as a measure of liquidity, nor is NOI necessarily indicative of cash available to fund cash needs. A calculation of NOI for the years ended December 31, 2007, 2006 and 2005, along with reconciliation to net income for each year, is as follows (dollars in thousands): 43 For the year ended 12-31-07 12-31-06 12-31-05 Net income $ 358,160 $ 266,546 $ 310,468 Indirect operating expenses, net of corporate income 31,285 28,811 26,675 Investments and investment management 11,737 7,030 4,834 Interest expense, net 97,545 109,184 125,171 General and administrative expense 28,494 24,767 25,761 Equity in income of unconsolidated entities (59,169 ) (7,455 ) (7,198 ) Minority interest in consolidated partnerships 1,585 573 1,481 Depreciation expense 179,549 160,442 156,455 Gain on sale of real estate assets (107,032 ) (110,930 ) (199,766 ) Income from discontinued operations (4,005 ) (5,618 ) (19,126 ) Net operating income $ 538,149 $ 473,350 $ 424,755 The NOI increases in both 2007 and 2006, as compared to the prior year period, consist of changes in the following categories (dollars in thousands): 2007 2006 Increase Increase Established Communities $ 29,866 $ 32,083 Other Stabilized Communities 10,185 5,379 Development and Redevelopment Communities 24,748 11,133 Total $ 64,799 $ 48,595 The NOI increases in Established Communities in 2007 were largely due to continued favorable apartment market fundamentals. During 2007, we continued to focus on rental rate growth, while maintaining occupancy of at least 95% in all regions. We anticipate that increases in rental rates and overall rental revenue growth will moderate in 2008 as compared to 2007, as we expect a slower rate of job growth (demand) and a decline in new rental completions in our markets (supply). We expect revenue growth from our Established Communities of 2.5% to 4.0% in 2008 as compared to 2007. In addition, we continue to monitor and manage operating expenses to constrain expense growth. We expect operating expenses at our Established Communities to increase by 2.0% to 3.0% in 2008 as compared to 2007 from increasing property tax, labor and utility expenses. Overall, we anticipate growth in NOI from our Established Communities of 3.0% to 4.5% in 2008 as compared to 2007. The Company has given projected NOI growth in 2008 only for Established Communities and not on a company-wide basis. The Company believes that NOI growth of the Established Communities assists investors in understanding management estimate of the likely contribution to operations from Established Communities. However, the Company has not provided a projection of NOI growth on a company-wide basis due to the difficulty in projecting the timing of new development starts, dispositions and acquisitions, as well as the complexities involved in projecting the allocation of corporate-level property management overhead, general and administrative costs and interest expense to communities not yet developed, disposed or acquired. NOI growth expected from Established Communities is not a projection of the Company projected consolidated financial performance or projected cash flow. Rental and other income increased in 2007 as compared to the prior year due to increased rental rates for our Established Communities, coupled with additional rental income generated from newly developed communities. Overall Portfolio The weighted average number of occupied apartment homes increased to 38,436 apartment homes for 2007 as compared to 37,716 apartment homes for 2006 and 36,520 apartment homes for 2005. This change is primarily the result of increased homes available from newly developed and acquired communities, partially offset by communities sold in 2007 and 2006. The weighted average monthly revenue per occupied apartment home increased to $1,767 in 2007 as compared to $1,610 in 2006 and $1,516 in 2005. 44 Established Communities - Rental revenue increased $34,257,000, or 5.5%, for 2007 and increased $35,871,000, or 6.8% in 2006. These increases are due to increased average rental rates, partially offset by decreased economic occupancy. For 2007, the weighted average monthly revenue per occupied apartment home increased 5.8% to $1,795 compared to $1,697 in 2006, primarily due to increased market rents and the decrease in the amortization of concessions. The higher amortization recognized in 2006 was due to the higher levels of concessions granted in periods prior to 2006. The average economic occupancy decreased 0.3% to 96.3% in 2007. Economic occupancy takes into account the fact that apartment homes of different sizes and locations within a community have different economic impacts on a community gross revenue. Economic occupancy is defined as gross potential revenue less vacancy loss, as a percentage of gross potential revenue. Gross potential revenue is determined by valuing occupied homes at leased rates and vacant homes at market rents. We experienced increases in Established Communities rental revenue in all six of our regions in 2007 as compared to 2006. The largest increases in rental revenue were in the Pacific Northwest, Northern California and the Mid-Atlantic, with increases of 11.1%, 8.6% and 5.9%, respectively, between years. The Northeast and Northern California regions comprise the majority of our Established Community revenue, and therefore are discussed in more detail below. Northern California, which represented approximately 24.6% of Established Community rental revenue during 2007, experienced an increase in rental revenue of 8.6% in 2007 as compared to 2006. Average rental rates increased by 8.3% to $1,699, and economic occupancy increased 0.3% to 97.0% in 2007. Apartment fundamentals remain strong in Northern California. We expect Northern California to see continued but moderating revenue growth during 2008 at growth levels in excess of those expected in other markets. The Northeast region, which accounted for approximately 42.3% of Established Community rental revenue during 2007, experienced an increase in rental revenue of 3.2% in 2007 as compared to 2006. Average rental rates increased 3.5% to $2,129, and economic occupancy decreased 0.3% to 96.2% in 2007. We expect overall apartment fundamentals in the Northeast region will be balanced during 2008, with slower job growth and except in the Boston area, minimal net new rental supply. Supply-demand fundamentals for New York City and surrounding areas should remain healthy, although changes in employment levels in the financial services industry could cause economic growth to decelerate. Boston will continue to lag the region in revenue growth, as we expect the net new supply from apartment deliveries will outpace improvement in the region economy. These factors support our expectation for moderate rental rate growth in 2008. In accordance with GAAP, cash concessions are amortized as an offset to rental revenue over the approximate lease term, which is generally one year. As a supplemental measure, we also present rental revenue with concessions stated on a cash basis to help investors evaluate the impact of both current and historical concessions on GAAP based rental revenue and to more readily enable comparisons to revenue as reported by other companies. Rental revenue with concessions stated on a cash basis also allows investors to understand historical trends in cash concessions, as well as current rental market conditions. The following table reconciles total rental revenue in conformity with GAAP to total rental revenue adjusted to state concessions on a cash basis for our Established Communities for the years ended December 31, 2007 and 2006 (dollars in thousands). Information for the year ended December 31, 2005 is not presented, as Established Community classification is not comparable prior to January 1, 2006. See Note 9, Segment Reporting, of our Consolidated Financial Statements. 45 For the year ended 12-31-07 12-31-06 Rental revenue (GAAP basis) $ 652,129 $ 617,872 Concessions amortized 6,119 12,336 Concessions granted (6,234 ) (6,236 ) Rental revenue adjusted to state concessions on a cash basis $ 652,014 $ 623,972 Year-over-year % change GAAP revenue 5.5 % n/a Year-over-year % change cash concession based revenue 4.5 % n/a Management, development and other fees decreased $117,000, or 1.9% in 2007 and increased $1,955,000 or 45.4% in 2006. The decrease in 2007 was due to lower development and redevelopment management fees, coupled with the loss of fees due to the disposition of our interest in a joint venture, partially offset by increased property management fees from the Fund, as additional communities are acquired. The increase in 2006 over 2005 was due to a full year of management fees from the Fund, which was formed in March 2005. Direct property operating expenses, excluding property taxes increased $16,411,000 or 9.3% and $14,014,000 or 8.7% in 2007 and 2006, respectively, primarily due to the addition of recently developed and acquired apartment homes coupled with expense growth in our Established Communities. For Established Communities, direct property operating expenses, excluding property taxes, increased $1,661,000, or 1.1%, and $3,030,000, or 2.4%, to $148,628,000 and $131,106,000 in 2007 and 2006, respectively, due primarily to increases in other maintenance, marketing and landscaping expenses offset by lower utility and redecorating costs. Property taxes increased $8,126,000 or 12.2% and $2,811,000 or 4.4% in 2007 and 2006, respectively, due to overall higher assessments and the addition of newly developed and redeveloped apartment homes. Property taxes are impacted by the size and timing of successful tax appeals in both years. For Established Communities, property taxes increased by $2,618,000, or 4.5%, and $721,000, or 1.4% in 2007 and 2006, respectively, due to higher assessments throughout all regions. Year over year changes are impacted by the size and timing of successful tax appeals . Overall, we expect property taxes in 2008 to increase from 2007 levels due to increased valuations and the addition of newly developed communities. Despite the potential decreases in real estate property values for tax purposes, there is generally a lag to the ultimate recognition of any savings in the real estate tax assessments. In addition, property tax increases are limited by law (Proposition 13) for communities in California. We evaluate property tax increases internally, as well as engage third-party consultants, and appeal increases when appropriate. Corporate-level property management and other indirect operating expenses increased by $4,450,000, or 13.0% and $2,934,000, or 9.4%, in 2007 and 2006, respectively, over the prior year periods due primarily to increased costs relating to corporate initiatives focused on increasing efficiency and enhancing controls at our operating communities, coupled with increased compensation and relocation costs. The 2007 expense includes the set up costs related to the office in Virginia Beach, Virginia that we opened in 2007. This office will be used to centralize certain community-related accounting, administrative and customer service functions. The transition began during the third quarter of 2007, when certain community-related accounting functions were relocated to our Virginia Beach office and is expected to continue through the end of 2008. Expenses in this category increased in 2006, primarily due to the addition of recently developed and acquired apartment homes coupled with expense growth in our Established Communities. Investments and investment management reflects the costs incurred for investment acquisitions, investment management and abandoned pursuit costs, which include costs incurred for development pursuits not yet considered probable for development, as well as the abandonment or impairment of development pursuits, acquisition pursuits and disposition pursuits. Investments and investment management costs increased in 2007 as compared to 2006 due primarily to increased abandoned pursuit costs. Abandoned pursuit costs were $6,974,000 in 2007, $2,115,000 in 2006 and $816,000 in 2005. Abandoned pursuit costs can be volatile, and the costs incurred in any given period may vary significantly in future periods. 46 Interest expense, net decreased $11,639,000 or 10.7% in 2007 and $15,987,000 or 12.8% in 2006 due primarily to higher levels of capitalized interest in connection with our increased development activity and increased interest income, partially offset by an increase in the average outstanding balance on our unsecured credit facility. Interest income increased in 2007 due to higher invested cash balances from our January 2007 equity offering as well as increases in the interest rate earned on cash deposits, offset partially by interest income in 2006 from an escrow funded from a disposition in 2005 that was used in a tax-deferred exchange. Depreciation expense increased $19,107,000 or 11.9% in 2007 and $3,987,000 or 2.5% in 2006 primarily due to the completion of development and redevelopment activities, partially offset by the loss of depreciation from assets sold. General and administrative expense ( G&A ) increased $3,727,000 or 15.0% in 2007 primarily due to increased compensation costs. G&A expenses decreased $994,000 or 3.9% in 2006 primarily due to the incurrence in 2005 of the following: (i) separation costs of approximately $2,100,000 due to the departure of a senior executive; (ii) the accrual of costs related to various litigation matters of approximately $1,500,000; and (iii) increased board of director fees due to the acceleration of equity awards with the resignation of a director due to disability in 2005, partially offset by higher compensation costs in 2006. Gain on sale of land in 2007 decreased from 2006 due to the volume and size of land parcels sold in each year. The increase in 2006 from 2005 is due to larger gains on sales in 2006. Equity in income of unconsolidated entities in 2007 increased from 2006 due primarily to the recognition in 2007 of approximately $60,000,000 in gains from the disposition of two investments, partially offset by losses (after depreciation) associated with two unconsolidated investments and the consolidation in 2007 of a community that was not consolidated as of December 31, 2006. Minority interest in consolidated partnerships increased in 2007 as compared to 2006 due to the recognition of the sale of a 70% joint venture partner interest in one of our consolidated communities (See Note 6, Investment in Real Estate Entities ). This increase was partially offset by the conversion and redemption of limited partnership units, thereby reducing outside ownership interests and the allocation of net income to outside ownership interests. The year-over-year decrease in 2006 was due to the conversion of limited partnership units, reducing the outside ownership interests. Income from discontinued operations represents the net income generated by communities sold or qualifying as discontinued operations during the period from January 1, 2006 through December 31, 2007. It decreased in 2007 and 2006 due to fewer communities sold or classified as discontinued operations. See Note 7, Real Estate Disposition Activities, of our Consolidated Financial Statements. Gain on sale of communities increased in 2007 due to the higher volume of dispositions in 2007. The decrease in 2006 as compared to 2005 is due to the volume and size of dispositions in the respective years relative to our basis in the assets. The amount of gain realized in any given reporting period depends on many factors, including the number of communities sold, the size and carrying value of those communities and the sales prices, which are driven by local and national market conditions. Funds from Operations Attributable to Common Stockholders ( FFO ) FFO is considered by management to be an appropriate supplemental measure of our operating and financial performance. In calculating FFO, we exclude gains or losses related to dispositions of previously depreciated property and exclude real estate depreciation, which can vary among owners of identical assets in similar condition based on historical cost accounting and useful life estimates. FFO can help one compare the operating performance of a real estate company between periods or as compared to different companies. We believe that in order to understand our operating results, FFO should be examined with net income as presented in our Consolidated Financial Statements included elsewhere this report. For a more detailed discussion and presentation of FFO, see Selected Financial Data, included in Item 6 of this report. 47 Liquidity and Capital Resources Factors affecting our liquidity and capital resources are our cash flows from operations, financing activities and investing activities, as well as general economic and market conditions. Operating cash flow has historically been determined by: (i) the number of apartment homes currently owned, (ii) rental rates, (iii) occupancy levels and (iv) operating expenses with respect to apartment homes. The timing, source and amount of cash flows provided by financing activities and used in investing activities are sensitive to the capital markets environment, particularly to changes in interest rates. The timing and type of capital markets activity in which we engage, as well as our plans for development, redevelopment, acquisition and disposition activity, are affected by changes in the capital markets environment, such as changes in interest rates or the availability of cost-effective capital. We regularly review our liquidity needs, the adequacy of cash flows from operations, and other expected liquidity sources to meet these needs. We believe our principal short-term liquidity needs are to fund: normal recurring operating expenses; debt service and maturity payments; preferred stock dividends and DownREIT partnership unit distributions; the minimum dividend payments on our common stock required to maintain our REIT qualification under the Internal Revenue Code of 1986; development and redevelopment activity in which we are currently engaged; and capital calls for the Fund, as required. Increased capital market volatility in 2007 and constrained liquidity suggest that our liquidity needs may be met in 2008 from sources that differ from historical sources. Increased use of secured debt and increased asset sales relative to our recent activity are expected for 2008. Although general market liquidity is constrained, we anticipate that we can satisfy these needs from a combination of cash flow provided by operating activities, proceeds from asset dispositions and borrowing capacity under our variable rate unsecured credit facility, as well as secured financings and other public or private sources of liquidity. Cash and cash equivalents totaled $21,222,000 at December 31, 2007, an increase of $12,938,000 from $8,284,000 at December 31, 2006. The following discussion relates to changes in cash due to operating, investing and financing activities, which are presented in our Consolidated Statements of Cash Flows included elsewhere in this report. Operating Activities Net cash provided by operating activities increased to $455,825,000 in 2007 from $351,660,000 in 2006. The increase was driven primarily by the additional NOI from our Established Communities operations, as well as NOI from recently developed communities. Investing Activities Net cash used in investing activities of $809,247,000 in 2007 related to investments in assets through the development and redevelopment of apartment communities, the acquisition of a community, and the acquisition of 17 land parcels, partially offset by proceeds from the disposition of a land parcel, four communities and a partnership interest in an unconsolidated real estate investment. During 2007, we invested $1,141,706,000 in the purchase and development of the following real estate and capital expenditures: We completed the development of eight communities containing a total of 1,749 apartment homes for a total capitalized cost, including land acquisition cost, of $440,700,000. We acquired 17 parcels of land in connection with Development Rights, for an aggregate purchase price of $311,691,000 . We had capital expenditures relating to current communities real estate assets of $13,851,000 and non-real estate capital expenditures of $1,424,000. 48 We commenced the development of 12 communities which are expected to contain a total of 3,412 apartment homes for an expected aggregate total capital cost of $1,279,800,000. Financing Activities Net cash provided by financing activities totaled $366,360,000 in 2007. The net cash inflow is due primarily to the proceeds from the issuance of 4,600,000 shares of the Company common stock at $129.30 per share, borrowings of $514,500,000 under our unsecured credit facility and the issuance of two mortgage notes for approximately $59,126,000, offset by the repurchase of 2,480,616 shares of our common stock at an average price of $103.95 per share, the repayment of mortgage notes of approximately $27,256,000, the repayment of unsecured notes at maturity of approximately $260,000,000 and dividend payments of $268,966,000. Variable Rate Unsecured Credit Facility In November 2007, we increased our borrowing capacity under our existing revolving variable rate unsecured credit facility from $650,000,000 to $1,000,000,000. The facility is with a syndicate of commercial banks, to whom we pay, in the aggregate, an annual facility fee of approximately $1,250,000. The unsecured credit facility bears interest at varying levels based on the London Interbank Offered Rate ( LIBOR ), our credit rating and on a maturity schedule selected by us. The current stated pricing is LIBOR plus 0.40% per annum (3.54% on January 31, 2008). The spread over LIBOR can vary from LIBOR plus 0.325% to LIBOR plus 1.00% based on our credit rating. In addition, a competitive bid option is available for borrowings of up to $422,500,000. This option allows banks that are part of the lender consortium to bid to provide us loans at a rate that is lower than the stated pricing provided by the unsecured credit facility. The competitive bid option may result in lower pricing if market conditions allow. We had no outstanding balance under this competitive bid option at January 31, 2008. We are subject to and currently in compliance with certain customary covenants under the unsecured credit facility, including, but not limited to, maintaining certain maximum leverage ratios, a minimum fixed charges coverage ratio and minimum unencumbered assets and equity levels. The credit facility matures in November 2011, assuming our exercise of a one-year renewal option. At January 31, 2008, $733,500,000 was outstanding on the credit facility, $57,000,000 was used to provide letters of credit and $209,361,000 was available for borrowing under the unsecured credit facility. 49 Future Financing and Capital Needs Debt Maturities One of our principal long-term liquidity needs is the repayment of long-term debt at the time that such debt matures. For unsecured notes, we anticipate that no significant portion of the principal of these notes will be repaid prior to maturity. If we do not have funds on hand sufficient to repay our indebtedness as it becomes due, it will be necessary for us to refinance the debt. This refinancing may be accomplished by uncollateralized private or public debt offerings, additional debt financing that is collateralized by mortgages on individual communities or groups of communities, draws on our unsecured credit facility or by equity offerings. Although we believe we will have the capacity to meet our long-term liquidity needs, we cannot assure you that additional debt financing or debt or equity offerings will be available or, if available, that they will be on terms we consider satisfactory. The following financing activity occurred during the year ended December 31, 2007: we issued $16,926,000 of variable rate mortgage debt for an operating community in June, maturing in May 2012; we repaid $15,980,000 of mortgage debt, secured by the assets of an operating community in July; we assumed $3,941,000 of fixed rate mortgage debt in conjunction with the acquisition of an operating community in July 2007 and subsequently defeased the note in December 2007; we issued $100,000,000 of variable rate, tax-exempt debt for a development community in June, maturing in November 2040; we repaid $150,000,000 in previously issued unsecured notes in August 2007, along with any unpaid interest, pursuant to their scheduled maturity; we issued $42,200,000 of fixed rate, tax-exempt mortgage debt for an operating community in September 2007, maturing in June 2047; we were relieved of our obligations associated with $8,116,000 in mortgage debt in conjunction with the disposition of the associated operating community in September 2007; we repaid $110,000,000 in previously issued unsecured notes in December 2007, along with any unpaid interest, pursuant to their scheduled maturity; we borrowed $514,500,000 under our unsecured credit facility; we increased our borrowing capacity under our unsecured credit facility by $350,000,000, to $1,000,000,000; we issued 4,600,000 shares of common stock at $129.30 per share for net proceeds of approximately $594,000,000 in conjunction with the inclusion of our common stock in the S&P 500 index in January 2007; and we repurchased 2,480,616 shares of our common stock at an average price of $103.95 per share, for a total approximate purchase price of $257,854,000. In February 2008, the Board of Directors authorized a further increase of $200,000,000 in the common stock repurchase program, increasing the total amount the Company can acquire to $500,000,000, of which approximately $300,000,000 has been used to repurchase our common stock as of January 31, 2008. The decision to use the additional share repurchase authorization will depend on current capital market conditions and liquidity, our share price relative to the net asset value per share and other uses of capital, including development. 50 The table below details debt maturities for the next five years, excluding our unsecured credit facility, and amounts outstanding related to communities classified as held for sale, for debt outstanding at December 31, 2007 (dollars in thousands, except footnotes).

(4) Financed by variable rate debt, but interest rate is capped through an interest rate protection agreement. 51 (5) Represents full amount of the debt as of December 31, 2007. Actual amounts drawn on the debt as of December 31, 2007 are $87,519,000 for Bowery Place I, $34,323,000 for Bowery Place II, $12,156,000 for Avalon Acton and $0 for Morningside Park. (6) Balances outstanding represent total amounts due at maturity, and are not net of $2,501 of debt discount as of December 31, 2007 and $2,922 of debt discount as of December 31, 2006, as reflected in unsecured notes on our Consolidated Balance Sheets included elsewhere in this report. (7) These notes were repaid at their scheduled maturity in January 2008. Future Financing and Capital Needs Portfolio and Other Activity As of December 31, 2007, we had 21 new communities under construction, for which a total estimated cost of $943,679,000 remained to be invested. In addition, we had eight communities which we own, or in which we have a direct or indirect interest, under reconstruction, for which a total estimated cost of $53,836,000 remained to be invested. Substantially all of the capital expenditures necessary to complete the communities currently under construction and reconstruction, as well as development costs related to pursuing Development Rights, will be funded from: cash currently on hand invested in highly liquid overnight money market funds and repurchase agreements, and short-term investment vehicles; the remaining capacity under our current $1,000,000,000 unsecured credit facility; the net proceeds from sales of existing communities; retained operating cash; the issuance of debt or equity securities; and/or private equity funding. Before planned reconstruction activity, including reconstruction activity related to communities acquired by the Fund as discussed below, or the construction of a Development Right begins, we intend to arrange adequate financing to complete these undertakings, although we cannot assure you that we will be able to obtain such financing. In the event that financing cannot be obtained, we may have to abandon Development Rights, write-off associated pre-development costs that were capitalized and/or forego reconstruction activity. In such instances, we will not realize the increased revenues and earnings that we expected from such Development Rights or reconstruction activity and significant losses could be incurred. We have invested in the Fund, a private, discretionary investment vehicle that acquires and operates apartment communities in our markets. The Fund has invested $777,568,000 as of December 31, 2007. Management of the Fund expects to invest approximately $46,000,000 of additional funds to redevelop the assets acquired, at which time the Fund will become fully invested. The Fund has nine institutional investors, including us, with a combined capital equity commitment of $330,000,000. A significant portion of the investments made in the Fund by its investors have been made through AvalonBay Value Added Fund, Inc., a Maryland corporation that qualifies as a REIT under the Internal Revenue Code (the Fund REIT ). A wholly-owned subsidiary of the Company is the general partner of the Fund and has committed $50,000,000 to the Fund and the Fund REIT (of which approximately $32,035,000 has been invested as of January 31, 2008) representing a 15.2% combined general partner and limited partner equity interest. As of January 31, 2008, the Fund has committed to invest approximately $818,367,000. We are exploring various potential sources for funding future acquisitions after the Fund is fully invested. From time to time we use joint ventures to hold or develop individual real estate assets. We generally employ joint ventures primarily to mitigate asset concentration or market risk or secondarily as a source of liquidity. We may also use joint ventures related to mixed-use land development opportunities where our partners bring development and operational expertise to the venture. Each joint venture or partnership agreement has been and will continue to be individually negotiated, and our ability to operate and/or dispose of a community in our sole discretion may be limited to varying degrees depending on the terms of the joint venture or partnership agreement. We cannot assure you that we will achieve our objectives through joint ventures. In evaluating our allocation of capital within our markets, we sell assets that do not meet our long-term investment criteria or when capital and real estate markets allow us to realize a portion of the value created over the past business cycle and redeploy the proceeds from those sales to develop and redevelop communities. In response to real estate and capital markets conditions, we sold four communities and one partnership interest in an unconsolidated entitiy for an aggregate sales price of $268,096,000 from January 1, 2007 through January 31, 2008. Because the proceeds from the sale of communities may not be immediately redeployed into revenue generating assets, the immediate effect of a sale of a community for a gain is to increase net income, but reduce future total revenues, total expenses and NOI. However, we believe that the absence of future cash flows from communities sold will have a minimal impact on our ability to fund future liquidity and capital resource needs. During 2008, we intend to dispose of between $700,000,000 and $1,000,000,000 in assets. However, actual disposition volume will depend on market conditions and other variables, which are subject to change in 2008. 52 Off Balance Sheet Arrangements In addition to the investment interests in consolidated and unconsolidated real estate entities, we have certain off-balance sheet arrangements with the entities in which we invest. Additional discussion of these entities can be found in Note 6, Investments in Real Estate Entities, and Note 8, Commitments and Contingencies, of our Consolidated Financial Statements located elsewhere in this report. CVP I, LLC has outstanding tax-exempt, variable rate bonds maturing in November 2036 in the amount of $117,000,000, which have permanent credit enhancement. We have agreed to guarantee, under limited circumstances, the repayment to the credit enhancer of any advances it may make in fulfillment of CVP I, LLC repayment obligations under the bonds . We have also guaranteed to the credit enhancer that CVP I, LLC will obtain a final certificate of occupancy for the project (Chrystie Place in New York City) overall once tenant improvements related to a retail tenant are complete, which is expected in the first half of 2008. Our 80% partner in this venture has agreed that it will reimburse us its pro rata share of any amounts paid relative to these guaranteed obligations. The estimated fair value of, and our obligation under these guarantees, both at inception and as of December 31, 2007 were not significant. As a result we have not recorded any obligation associated with these guarantees at December 31, 2007. MVP I, LLC executed a construction loan in the amount of $94,000,000 to finance the development of Avalon at Mission Bay North II. In conjunction with the construction management services that the Company provided to MVP I, LLC, the Company provided a construction completion guarantee to the construction loan lender in order to fulfill their standard financing requirements related to construction financing. In the fourth quarter of 2007, all of the lender standard completion requirements were satisfied and the obligation of the Company under this guarantee terminated. In December 2007, MVP I, LLC repaid the construction loan, concurrently executing a seven-year, fixed rate conventional loan. The Fund has 20 loans secured by individual assets with amounts outstanding in the aggregate of $447,166,000. These mortgage loans have varying maturity dates (or dates after which the loans can be prepaid), ranging from October 2011 to September 2016. These mortgage loans are secured by the underlying real estate. In addition, the Fund had amounts outstanding of $47,400,000 as of December 31, 2007 under its credit facilities, all of which is under an unsecured facility maturing in December 2008. The Fund did not have any amounts outstanding at December 31, 2007 under the Fund credit facility secured by uncalled capital commitments that matured in January 2008. The mortgage loans and the credit facility are payable by the Fund with operating cash flow from the underlying real estate, and the credit facility is secured by capital commitments. We have not guaranteed the debt of the Fund, nor do we have any obligation to fund this debt should the Fund be unable to do so. In addition, as part of the formation of the Fund, we have provided to one of the limited partners a guarantee. The guarantee provides that if, upon final liquidation of the Fund, the total amount of all distributions to that partner during the life of the Fund (whether from operating cash flow or property sales) does not equal a minimum of the total capital contributions made by that partner, then we will pay the partner an amount equal to the shortfall, but in no event more than 10% of the total capital contributions made by the partner (maximum of approximately $6,510,000 as of December 31, 2007). As of December 31, 2007, the fair value of the real estate assets owned by the Fund is considered adequate to cover such potential payment to that partner under a liquidation scenario. The estimated fair value of, and our obligation under this guarantee, both at inception and as of December 31, 2007 was not significant and therefore we have not recorded any obligation for this guarantee as of December 31, 2007. 53 In connection with the pursuit of a Development Right in Pleasant Hill, California, $125,000,000 in bond financing was issued by the Contra Costa County Redevelopment Agency (the Agency ) in connection with the possible future construction of a multifamily rental community by PHVP I, LLC. The bond proceeds were immediately invested in their entirety in a guaranteed investment contract ( GIC ) administered by a trustee. This Development Right is planned as a mixed-use development, with residential, for-sale, retail and office components. The bond proceeds will remain in the GIC until August 2008 , at which time a loan will be made to PHVP I, LLC to fund construction of the multifamily portion of the development, or the bonds will be redeemed by the Agency. We are currently in discussions to extend both the term until the bond financing proceeds must be used for development of the multifamily portion of the project, and the GIC until August 2008, when construction of the multifamily portion of the development is now expected to begin. Although we do not have any equity or economic interest in PHVP I, LLC at this time, we do have an option to make a capital contribution to PHVP I, LLC in exchange for a 99% general partner interest in the entity. Should we decide not to exercise this option, bond proceeds will be released from escrow, the bonds will be redeemed without penalty and a loan will not be made to PHVP I, LLC. The bonds are payable from the proceeds of the GIC and are non-recourse to both PHVP I, LLC and to us. There is no loan payable outstanding by PHVP I, LLC as of December 31, 2007. In addition, as part of providing construction management services to PHVP I, LLC for the construction of a public garage, we have provided a construction completion guarantee to the related lender in order to fulfill their standard financing requirements related to the garage construction financing. Our obligations under this guarantee will terminate following construction completion of the garage once all of the lender standard completion requirements have been satisfied, which we currently expect to occur in the first half of 2008. In the third quarter of 2006, significant modifications were requested by the local transit authority to change the garage structure design. We do not believe that the requested design changes impact the construction schedule. However, it is expected that these changes will increase the original budget by an amount up to $5,000,000. We believe that substantially all potential additional amounts are reimbursable from unrelated third parties. At this time we do not believe that it is probable that we will incur any additional costs. The estimated fair value of, and our obligation under this guarantee, both at inception and as of December 31, 2007 was not significant and therefore we have not recorded any obligation for this guarantee as of December 31, 2007. In the fourth quarter of 2006, we admitted a 70% venture partner to the Avalon Del Rey Apartments, LLC for an investment of $49,000,000, including the assumption of debt. In conjunction with this investment, we provided an operating guarantee to the joint venture partner which stated that if the initial year return earned by the joint venture partner was less than a threshold return of 7% on its initial equity investment, we would pay the joint venture partner an amount equal to the shortfall, up to the 7% threshold return required. In the fourth quarter of 2007, the initial year return earned by the joint venture partner was determined to be in excess of the guarantee threshold thereby satisfying all provisions of the Company under this guarantee. There are no other lines of credit, side agreements, financial guarantees or any other derivative financial instruments related to or between our unconsolidated real estate entities and us. In evaluating our capital structure and overall leverage, management takes into consideration our proportionate share of this unconsolidated debt. Contractual Obligations We currently have contractual obligations consisting primarily of long-term debt obligations and lease obligations for certain land parcels and regional and administrative office space. During the second quarter of 2007, we entered into an operating lease for 20,000 square feet of office space in Virginia Beach, Virginia. We began to utilize this space for certain of our community-related accounting and customer service functions in the third quarter of 2007. There have not been any other material changes outside the ordinary course of business to our contractual obligations during 2007. Scheduled contractual obligations required for the next five years and thereafter are as follows as of December 31, 2007 (dollars in thousands): 54 Payments due by period Less than More than 5 Total 1 Year 1-3 Years 3-5 Years Years Debt Obligations (1) $ 3,210,703 $ 723,720 $ 467,959 $ 923,311 $ 1,095,713 Operating Lease Obligations (2) 2,142,739 14,412 29,108 29,268 2,069,951 Total $ 5,353,442 $ 738,132 $ 497,067 $ 952,579 $ 3,165,664 (1) Includes $514,500 outstanding under our variable rate unsecured credit facility as of December 31, 2007. The table of contractual obligations assumes repayment of this amount in 2008 See Liquidity and Capital Resources. Amounts exclude interest payable as of December 31, 2007. (2) Includes land leases expiring between November 2028 and March 2142. Amounts do not include any adjustment for purchase options available under the land leases. Inflation and Deflation Substantially all of our apartment leases are for a term of one year or less. In an inflationary environment, this may allow us to realize increased rents upon renewal of existing leases or the beginning of new leases. Short-term leases generally minimize our risk from the adverse effects of inflation, although these leases generally permit residents to leave at the end of the lease term and therefore expose us to the effect of a decline in market rents. In a deflationary rent environment, we may be exposed to declining rents more quickly under these shorter-term leases. Forward-Looking Statements This Form 10-K contains forward-looking statements as that term is defined under the Private Securities Litigation Reform Act of 1995. You can identify forward-looking statements by our use of the words believe, expect, anticipate, intend, estimate, assume, project, plan, may, shall, will and other similar expressions in this Form 10-K, that predict or indicate future events and trends and that do not report historical matters. These statements include, among other things, statements regarding our intent, belief or expectations with respect to: our potential development, redevelopment, acquisition or disposition of communities; the timing and cost of completion of apartment communities under construction, reconstruction, development or redevelopment; the timing of lease-up, occupancy and stabilization of apartment communities; the pursuit of land on which we are considering future development; the anticipated operating performance of our communities; cost, yield and earnings estimates; our declaration or payment of distributions; our joint venture and discretionary fund activities; our policies regarding investments, indebtedness, acquisitions, dispositions, financings and other matters; our qualification as a REIT under the Internal Revenue Code; the real estate markets in Northern and Southern California and markets in selected states in the Mid-Atlantic, Northeast, Midwest and Pacific Northwest regions of the United States and in general; the availability of debt and equity financing; interest rates; general economic conditions; and trends affecting our financial condition or results of operations. 55 We cannot assure the future results or outcome of the matters described in these statements; rather, these statements merely reflect our current expectations of the approximate outcomes of the matters discussed. You should not rely on forward-looking statements because they involve known and unknown risks, uncertainties and other factors, some of which are beyond our control. These risks, uncertainties and other factors may cause our actual results, performance or achievements to differ materially from the anticipated future results, performance or achievements expressed or implied by these forward-looking statements. You should carefully review the discussion under Item 1a, Risk Factors, elsewhere in this report for a discussion of risks associated with forward-looking statements. In addition, these forward-looking statements represent our estimates and assumptions only as of the date of this report. We do not undertake a duty to update these forward-looking statements, and therefore they may not represent our estimates and assumptions after the date of this report. Some of the factors that could cause our actual results, performance or achievements to differ materially from those expressed or implied by these forward-looking statements include, but are not limited to, the following: we may fail to secure development opportunities due to an inability to reach agreements with third parties to obtain land at attractive prices or to obtain desired zoning and other local approvals; we may abandon or defer development opportunities for a number of reasons, including changes in local market conditions which make development less desirable, increases in costs of development and increases in the cost of capital, resulting in losses; construction costs of a community may exceed our original estimates; we may not complete construction and lease-up of communities under development or redevelopment on schedule, resulting in increased interest costs and construction costs and a decrease in our expected rental revenues; occupancy rates and market rents may be adversely affected by competition and local economic and market conditions which are beyond our control; financing may not be available on favorable terms or at all, and our cash flows from operations and access to cost effective capital may be insufficient for the development of our pipeline which could limit our pursuit of opportunities; our cash flows may be insufficient to meet required payments of principal and interest, and we may be unable to refinance existing indebtedness or the terms of such refinancing may not be as favorable as the terms of existing indebtedness; we may be unsuccessful in our management of the Fund and the Fund REIT; and we may be unsuccessful in managing changes in our portfolio composition. Critical Accounting Policies The preparation of financial statements in conformity with GAAP requires management to use judgment in the application of accounting policies, including making estimates and assumptions. If our judgment or interpretation of the facts and circumstances relating to various transactions had been different, or different assumptions were made, it is possible that different accounting policies would have been applied, resulting in different financial results or a different presentation of our financial statements. Below is a discussion of the accounting policies that we consider critical to an understanding of our financial condition and operating results that may require complex or significant judgment in their application or require estimates about matters which are inherently uncertain. A discussion of our significant accounting policies, including further discussion of the accounting policies described below, can be found in Note 1, Organization and Significant Accounting Policies of our Consolidated Financial Statements. Principles of Consolidation We may enter into various joint venture agreements with unrelated third parties to hold or develop real estate assets. We must determine for each of these ventures, whether to consolidate the entity or account for our investment under the equity or cost basis of accounting. 56 We determine whether to consolidate certain entities based on our rights and obligations under the joint venture agreements, applying the guidance of FIN 46(R), Consolidation of Variable Interest Entities (as revised) and Emerging Issues Task Force Issue No. 04-5, Determining Whether a General Partner, or the General Partners as a Group, Controls a Limited Partnership or Similar Entity When the Limited Partners Have Certain Rights. For investment interests that we do not consolidate, we look to the guidance in AICPA Statement of Position 78-9, Accounting for Investments in Real Estate Ventures , Accounting Principles Board Opinion No. 18, The Equity Method of Accounting for Investments in Common Stock , and Emerging Issues Task Force Topic D-46, Accounting for Limited Partnership Investments , to determine the accounting framework to apply. The application of these rules in evaluating the accounting treatment for each joint venture is complex and requires substantial management judgment. Therefore, we believe the decision to choose an appropriate accounting framework is a critical accounting estimate. If we were to consolidate the joint ventures that we accounted for using the equity method at December 31, 2007, our assets would have increased by $1,029,093,000 and our liabilities would have increased by $739,806,000. We would be required to consolidate those joint ventures currently not consolidated for financial reporting purposes if the facts and circumstances changed, including but not limited to the following reasons, none of which are currently expected to occur: For entities not considered to be variable interest entities under FIN 46(R), the nature of the entity changed such that it would be considered a variable interest entity. For entities in which we do not hold a controlling voting and/or variable interest, the contractual arrangement changes resulting in our investment interest being either a controlling voting and/or variable interest. We evaluate our accounting for investments on a quarterly basis or when a significant change in the design of an entity occurs. Cost Capitalization We capitalize costs during the development of assets beginning when we determine that development of a future asset is probable until the asset, or a portion of the asset, is delivered and is ready for its intended use. For redevelopment efforts, we capitalize costs beginning either (i) in advance of taking homes out of service when significant renovation of the common area has begun until the redevelopment is completed, or (ii) when an apartment home is taken out of service for redevelopment until the redevelopment is completed and the apartment home is available for a new resident. Rental income and operating expenses incurred during the initial lease-up or post-redevelopment lease-up period are fully recognized as they accrue. During the development and redevelopment efforts we capitalize all direct and those indirect costs which have been incurred as a result of the development and redevelopment activities. These costs include interest and related loan fees, property taxes as well as other direct and indirect costs. Interest is capitalized for any project specific financing, as well as for general corporate financing to the extent of our aggregate investment in the projects. Indirect project costs, which include personnel and office and administrative costs, that are clearly associated with our development and redevelopment efforts are also capitalized. The estimation of the direct and indirect costs to capitalize as part of our development and redevelopment activities requires judgment, and as such, we believe cost capitalization to be a critical accounting estimate. There may be a change in our operating expenses in the event that there are changes in accounting guidance governing capitalization or changes to development or redevelopment activity. If changes in the accounting guidance limit our ability to capitalize costs or if we reduce our development and redevelopment activities without a corresponding decrease in indirect project costs, there may be an increase in our operating expenses. For example, if in 2007 our development activities decreased by 10%, and there were no corresponding decrease in our indirect project costs, our operating expenses would have increased by $2,748,000. 57 We capitalize pre-development costs incurred in pursuit of Development Rights for which we currently believe future development is probable. These costs include legal fees, design fees and related overhead costs. Future development of these pursuits is dependent upon various factors, including zoning and regulatory approval, rental market conditions, construction costs and availability of capital. Pre-development costs incurred in the pursuit of Development Rights for which future development is not yet considered probable are expensed as incurred. In addition, if the status of a Development Right changes, making future development no longer probable, any capitalized pre-development costs are written-off with a charge to expense. Due to the subjectivity in determining whether a pursuit will result in the acquisition or development of an apartment community, and therefore should be capitalized, the accounting for pursuit costs is a critical accounting estimate. If it were determined that 10% of our capitalized pursuits were no longer probable of occurring, net income for the year ended December 31, 2007 would have decreased by $6,100,000. Asset Impairment Evaluation We apply the provisions of SFAS No. 144, Accounting for the Impairment or Disposal of Long-Lived Assets , to determine the need for performing impairment analyses, as well as to measure the loss if an impairment has occurred on a regular basis, considering qualitative economic factors. Because each asset is unique, requiring significant management judgment, we believe that the asset impairment evaluation is a critical accounting estimate. Management judgment is required both to determine if a significant event has occurred, such that an impairment analysis is necessary, as well as for the assessment and measurement of any potential impairment. To perform the impairment analysis, we must estimate the undiscounted future cash flows associated with the asset, which in the case of an apartment community would be the NOI, as well as potential disposition proceeds for a given asset. Forecasting cash flows requires assumptions about such variables as the estimated holding period, rental rates, occupancy and operating expenses during the holding period as well as disposition proceeds. In addition, when an impairment has occurred, we must estimate the discount factor, or market capitalization rate to apply to the undiscounted cash flows to derive the fair value of the position. The market capitalization rate is influenced by many factors, including national and local economic conditions, as well as the location and quality of the asset. Changes in the future cash flows associated with an asset have a direct, linear relationship to the fair value of the position. For example, if there is a 10% decline in the estimated NOI for a community, there would be a corresponding decrease in the fair value of that asset of 10%. Changes in the market capitalization rate have an inverse relationship with the fair value of an asset, with a decrease in the market capitalization rate resulting in an increase in the fair value of the asset. For example, an asset that is valued at $80,000,000 when using a five percent market capitalization rate will increase in value to $100,000,000 if the market capitalization rate decreases by one percent to four percent, and to $133,000,000 if the market capitalization rate decreases by two percent, to a three percent market capitalization rate. For the year ended December 31, 2007, we did not recognize any impairment in value associated with our investments or long-lived assets. We cannot predict the occurrence of future events that may cause an impairment assessment to be performed. REIT Status We are a Maryland corporation that has elected to be treated, for federal income tax purposes, as a REIT. We elected to be taxed as a REIT under the Internal Revenue Code of 1986 ( the Code ), as amended, for the year ended December 31, 1994 and have not revoked such election. A corporate REIT is a legal entity which holds real estate interests and must meet a number of organizational and operational requirements, including a requirement that it currently distribute at least 90% of its adjusted taxable income to stockholders. As a REIT, we generally will not be subject to corporate level federal income tax on taxable income if we distribute 100% of taxable income to our stockholders over time periods allowed under the Code. If we fail to qualify as a REIT in any taxable year, we will be subject to federal and state income taxes at regular corporate rates (subject to any applicable alternative minimum tax) and may not be able to elect to qualify as a REIT for four subsequent taxable years. For example, if we failed to qualify as a REIT in 2007, our net income would have decreased by approximately $119,800,000. 58 Our qualification as a REIT requires management to exercise significant judgment and consideration with respect to operational matters and accounting treatment. Therefore, we believe our REIT status is a critical accounting estimate.
