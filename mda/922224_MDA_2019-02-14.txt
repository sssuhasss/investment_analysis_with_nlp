Item 7. Combined Management's Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations (All Registrants) This "Item 7. Combined Management's Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations" is separately filed by PPL, PPL Electric, LKE, LG&E and KU. Information contained herein relating to any individual Registrant is filed by such Registrant solely on its own behalf, and no Registrant makes any representation as to information relating to any other Registrant. The specific Registrant to which disclosures are applicable is identified in parenthetical headings in italics above the applicable disclosure or within the applicable disclosure for each Registrant's related activities and disclosures. Within combined disclosures, amounts are disclosed for individual Registrants when significant. The following should be read in conjunction with the Registrants' Consolidated Financial Statements and the accompanying Notes. Capitalized terms and abbreviations are defined in the glossary. Dollars are in millions, except per share data, unless otherwise noted. "Management's Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations" includes the following information: "Overview" provides a description of each Registrant's business strategy and a discussion of important financial and operational developments. "Results of Operations" for all Registrants includes a "Statement of Income Analysis," which discusses significant changes in principal line items on the Statements of Income, comparing 2018 with 2017 and 2017 with 2016. For PPL, "Results of Operations" also includes "Segment Earnings" and "Adjusted Gross Margins" which provide a detailed analysis of earnings by reportable segment. These discussions include non-GAAP financial measures, including "Earnings from Ongoing Operations" and "Adjusted Gross Margins" and provide explanations of the non-GAAP financial measures and a reconciliation of the non-GAAP financial measures to the most comparable GAAP measure. The "2019 Outlook" discussion identifies key factors expected to impact 2019 earnings. For PPL Electric, LKE, LG&E and KU, a summary of earnings and adjusted gross margins is also provided. "Financial Condition - Liquidity and Capital Resources" provides an analysis of the Registrants' liquidity positions and credit profiles. This section also includes a discussion of forecasted sources and uses of cash and rating agency actions. "Financial Condition - Risk Management" provides an explanation of the Registrants' risk management programs relating to market and credit risk. "Application of Critical Accounting Policies" provides an overview of the accounting policies that are particularly important to the results of operations and financial condition of the Registrants and that require their management to make significant estimates, assumptions and other judgments of inherently uncertain matters. Overview For a description of the Registrants and their businesses, see "Item 1. Business." Business Strategy (All Registrants) PPL operates seven fully regulated high-performing utilities. These utilities are located in the U.K., Pennsylvania and Kentucky, constructive regulatory jurisdictions with distinct regulatory structures and customer classes. PPL believes this business portfolio positions the company well for continued success and provides earnings and dividend growth potential. PPL's strategy, and that of the other Registrants, is to deliver best-in-sector operational performance, invest in a sustainable energy future, maintain a strong financial foundation, and engage and develop its people. PPL's business plan is designed to achieve growth by providing efficient, reliable and safe operations and strong customer service, maintaining constructive regulatory relationships and achieving timely recovery of costs. These businesses are expected to achieve strong, long-term growth in rate base in the U.S. and RAV in the U.K. Rate base growth is being driven by planned significant capital expenditures to maintain existing assets and improve system reliability and, for LKE, LG&E and KU, to comply with federal and state environmental regulations related to coal-fired electricity generation facilities. 37 Table of Contents For the U.S. businesses, central to PPL's strategy is recovering capital project costs efficiently through various rate-making mechanisms, including periodic base rate case proceedings using forward test years, annual FERC formula rate mechanisms and other regulatory agency-approved recovery mechanisms designed to limit regulatory lag. In Kentucky, the KPSC has adopted a series of regulatory mechanisms (ECR, DSM, GLT, fuel adjustment clause, gas supply clause and recovery on construction work-in-progress) that reduce regulatory lag and provide timely recovery of and return on, as appropriate, prudently incurred costs. In addition, the KPSC requires a utility to obtain a CPCN prior to constructing a facility, unless the construction is an ordinary extension of existing facilities in the usual course of business or does not involve sufficient capital expenditures to materially affect the utility's financial condition. Although such KPSC proceedings do not directly address cost recovery issues, the KPSC, in awarding a CPCN, concludes that the public convenience and necessity require the construction of the facility on the basis that the facility is the lowest reasonable cost alternative to address the need. In Pennsylvania, the FERC transmission formula rate, DSIC mechanism, Smart Meter Rider and other recovery mechanisms are in place to reduce regulatory lag and provide for timely recovery of and a return on, as appropriate, prudently incurred costs. To manage financing costs and access to credit markets, and to fund capital expenditures, a key objective of the Registrants is to maintain their investment grade credit ratings and adequate liquidity positions. In addition, the Registrants have financial and operational risk management programs that, among other things, are designed to monitor and manage exposure to earnings and cash flow volatility, as applicable, related to changes in interest rates, foreign currency exchange rates and counterparty credit quality. To manage these risks, PPL generally uses contracts such as forwards, options and swaps. See "Financial Condition - Risk Management" below for further information. Earnings generated by PPL's U.K. subsidiaries are subject to foreign currency translation risk. Because WPD's earnings represent such a significant portion of PPL's consolidated earnings, PPL enters into foreign currency contracts to economically hedge the value of the GBP versus the U.S. dollar. These hedges do not receive hedge accounting treatment under GAAP. See "Financial and Operational Developments - U.K. Membership in European Union" for additional discussion of the U.K. earnings hedging activity. The U.K. subsidiaries also have currency exposure to the U.S. dollar to the extent of their U.S. dollar denominated debt. To manage these risks, PPL generally uses contracts such as forwards, options and cross-currency swaps that contain characteristics of both interest rate and foreign currency exchange contracts. As discussed above, a key component of this strategy is to maintain constructive relationships with regulators in all jurisdictions in which the Registrants operate (U.K., U.S. federal and state). This is supported by a strong culture of integrity and delivering on commitments to customers, regulators and shareowners, and a commitment to continue to improve customer service, reliability and operational efficiency. Financial and Operational Developments Equity Forward Contracts (PPL) In May 2018, PPL completed a registered underwritten public offering of 55 million shares of its common stock. In conjunction with that offering, the underwriters exercised an option to purchase 8.25 million additional shares of PPL common stock solely to cover over-allotments. In connection with the registered public offering, PPL entered into forward sale agreements with two counterparties covering the 63.25 million shares of PPL common stock. Full settlement of these forward sale agreements will occur no later than November 2019. The forward sale agreements are classified as equity transactions. PPL only receives proceeds and issues shares of common stock upon any settlements of the forward sale agreements. PPL intends to use net proceeds that it receives upon any settlements for general corporate purposes. In September 2018, PPL settled a portion of the initial forward sale agreements by issuing 20 million shares of PPL common stock, and received net cash proceeds of $520 million. For the unsettled portion of the agreements, the only impact to the financial statements is the inclusion of incremental shares within the calculation of diluted EPS using the Treasury Stock Method. See Note 8 to the Financial Statements for additional information. 38 Table of Contents U.S. Tax Reform (All Registrants) The Registrants recognized certain provisional amounts relating to the impact of the enactment of the TCJA in their December 31, 2017 financial statements, in accordance with SEC guidance. Included in those provisional amounts were estimates of: tax depreciation, deductible executive compensation, accumulated foreign earnings, foreign tax credits, and deemed dividends from foreign subsidiaries, all of which were based on the interpretation and application of various provisions of the TCJA. In the third quarter of 2018, PPL filed its consolidated federal income tax return, which was prepared using guidance issued by the U.S. Treasury Department and the IRS since the filing of each Registrant's 2017 Form 10-K. Accordingly, the Registrants have updated the following provisional amounts and now consider them to be complete: (1) the amount of the deemed dividend and associated foreign tax credits relating to the transition tax imposed on accumulated foreign earnings as of December 31, 2017; (2) the amount of accelerated 100% "bonus" depreciation PPL was eligible to claim in its 2017 federal income tax return; and (3) the related impacts on PPL's 2017 consolidated federal net operating loss to be carried forward to future periods. In addition, the Registrants recorded the tax impact of the U.S. federal corporate income tax rate reduction from 35% to 21% on the changes to deferred tax assets and liabilities resulting from the completed provisional amounts. The completed provisional amounts related to the tax rate reduction had an insignificant impact on the net regulatory liabilities of PPL's U.S. regulated operations. In the fourth quarter of 2018, PPL completed its analysis of the deductibility of executive compensation awarded as of November 2, 2017 and concluded that no material change to the provisional amounts is required. See Note 6 to the Financial Statements for the final amounts reported in PPL's 2017 federal income tax return, provisional adjustment amounts for the year ended December 31, 2017, the related measurement period adjustments and the resulting tax impact for 2018. The Registrants' accounting related to the effects of the TCJA on financial results for the period ended December 31, 2017 is complete as of December 31, 2018 with respect to all provisional amounts. In 2018, the IRS issued proposed regulations for certain provisions of the TCJA, including interest deductibility, Base Erosion Anti-Avoidance Tax (BEAT), and Global Intangible Low-Taxed Income (GILTI). PPL has determined that the proposed regulations related to BEAT and GILTI do not materially change PPL's current interpretation of the statutory impact of these rules on the company. Proposed regulations relating to the limitation on the deductibility of interest expense were issued in November 2018 and such regulations provide detailed rules implementing the broader statutory provisions. These proposed regulations should not apply to the Registrants until the year in which the regulations are issued in final form, which is expected to be 2019. It is uncertain what form the final regulations will take and, therefore, the Registrants cannot predict what impact the final regulations will have on the tax deductibility of interest expense. However, if the proposed regulations were issued as final in their current form, the Registrants could have a limitation on a portion of their interest expense deduction for tax purposes and such limitation could be significant. Kentucky State Tax Reform (All Registrants) HB 487, which became law on April 27, 2018, provides for significant changes to the Kentucky tax code including (1) adopting mandatory combined reporting for corporate members of unitary business groups for taxable years beginning on or after January 1, 2019 (members of a unitary business group may make an eight-year binding election to file consolidated corporate income tax returns with all members of their federal affiliated group) and (2) a reduction in the Kentucky corporate income tax rate from 6% to 5% for taxable years beginning after December 31, 2017. LKE recognized a deferred tax charge of $9 million in the second quarter of 2018 primarily associated with the remeasurement of non-regulated accumulated deferred income tax balances. As indicated in Note 1 to the Financial Statements, LG&E's and KU's accounting for income taxes is impacted by rate regulation. Therefore, reductions in regulated accumulated deferred income tax balances due to the reduction in the Kentucky corporate income tax rate to 5% under the provisions of HB 487 will result in amounts previously collected from utility customers for these deferred taxes to be refundable to such customers in future periods. In the second quarter of 2018, LG&E and KU recorded the impact of the reduced tax rate, related to the remeasurement of deferred income taxes, as an increase in regulatory liabilities of $16 million and $19 million . In a separate regulatory proceeding, LG&E and KU have requested to begin returning state excess deferred income taxes to customers in conjunction with the 2018 Kentucky base rate case, which was filed on September 28, 2018. See Note 7 to the Financial Statements for additional information related to the rate case proceedings. PPL is evaluating the impact, if any, of unitary or elective consolidated income tax reporting on all its Registrants. 39 Table of Contents U.K. Membership in European Union (PPL) The U.K. formally began the process of leaving the European Union (EU) on March 29, 2017 by triggering Article 50 of the Lisbon Treaty. The U.K. has two years from that date to negotiate a withdrawal agreement governing its exit from the EU (Brexit). The U.K. and EU also agreed to a transition period lasting until the end of 2020, during which both parties will negotiate a future trade relationship. The final withdrawal agreement and future trade relationship are subject to ratification by both the U.K. and EU parliaments. In November 2018, U.K. Prime Minister Theresa May and the EU decided on a withdrawal agreement covering a broad range of issues. On January 15, 2019, the U.K. Parliament voted overwhelmingly to reject this withdrawal agreement. On January 29, 2019, the U.K. Parliament voted on a series of non-binding amendments to influence future Brexit negotiations, directing May to conduct further negotiations with the EU. The EU has said that it is not prepared to renegotiate the existing deal. Significant uncertainty surrounds the status of negotiations and next steps in the Brexit process. If an agreement is not reached, the default position is that the U.K. will have a disorderly exit from the EU on March 29, 2019. The U.K. may also request an extension of the Article 50 process, subject to approval from the EU 27 remaining members. The U.K. could also choose to revoke Article 50 and remain in the EU. PPL believes that its greatest risk related to Brexit is the potential decline in the value of the GBP compared to the U.S. dollar. A decline in the value of the GBP compared to the U.S. dollar will reduce the value of WPD's earnings to PPL. PPL has executed hedges to mitigate the foreign exchange risk to its U.K. earnings. As of February 6, 2019, PPL's foreign exchange exposure related to budgeted earnings is 100% hedged for the remainder of 2019 at an average rate of $1.39 per GBP and 49% hedged for 2020 at an average rate of $1.49 per GBP. PPL cannot predict the impact, in either the short-term or long-term, on foreign exchange rates or PPL's financial condition that may be experienced as a result of the actions taken by the U.K. government to withdraw from the EU, although such impacts could be material. PPL does not expect the financial condition and results of operations of WPD itself to change significantly as a result of Brexit, with or without an approved plan of withdrawal. The regulatory environment and operation of WPD's businesses are not expected to change. WPD is less than halfway through RIIO-ED1, the current price control period, with allowed revenues agreed with Ofgem through March 2023. The impact of a slower economy or recession on WPD would be mitigated in part because U.K. regulation provides that any reduction in the volume of electricity delivered will be recovered in allowed revenues in future periods through the K-factor adjustment. See "Item 1. Business - Segment Information - U.K. Regulated Segment" for additional information on the current price control and K-factor adjustment. In addition, an increase in inflation would have a positive effect on revenues and RAV as annual inflation adjustments are applied to both revenues and RAV (and real returns are earned on inflated RAV). This impact, however, would be partially offset by higher O&M and interest expense on index-linked debt. With respect to access to financing, WPD has substantial borrowing capacity under existing credit facilities and expects to continue to have access to all major financial markets. With respect to access to and cost of equipment and other materials, WPD management continues to review U.K. government issued advice on preparations for Brexit without an approved plan of withdrawal and has taken actions to mitigate potential increasing costs and disruption to its critical sources of supply. Additionally, less than 1% of WPD's employees are non-U.K. EU nationals and no change in their domicile is expected. Regulatory Requirements ( All Registrants) The Registrants cannot predict the impact that future regulatory requirements may have on their financial condition or results of operations. 40 Table of Contents TCJA Impact on LG&E and KU Rates (PPL, LKE, LG&E and KU) On December 21, 2017, Kentucky Industrial Utility Customers, Inc. submitted a complaint with the KPSC against LG&E and KU, as well as other utility companies in Kentucky, alleging that their respective rates would no longer be fair, just and reasonable following the enactment of the TCJA, which reduced the federal corporate tax rate from 35% to 21%. The complaint requested the KPSC to issue an order requiring LG&E and KU to begin deferring, as of January 1, 2018, the revenue requirement effect of all income tax expense savings resulting from the federal corporate income tax reduction, including the amortization of excess deferred income taxes by recording those savings in a regulatory liability account and establishing a process by which the federal corporate income tax savings will be passed back to customers. On January 29, 2018, LG&E, KU, Kentucky Industrial Utility Customers, Inc. and the Office of the Attorney General reached a settlement agreement to commence returning savings related to the TCJA to their customers through their ECR, DSM and LG&E's GLT rate mechanisms beginning in March 2018 and through a new bill credit mechanism from April 1, 2018 through April 30, 2019 and thereafter until tax-reform related savings are reflected in changes in base rates. The estimated impact of the rate reduction represents approximately $91 million in KU electricity revenues ( $70 million through the new bill credit and $21 million through existing rate mechanisms), $69 million in LG&E electricity revenues ( $49 million through the new bill credit and $20 million through existing rate mechanisms) and $17 million in LG&E gas revenues (substantially all through the new bill credit) for the period January 2018 through April 2019. On March 20, 2018, the KPSC issued an Order approving, with certain modifications, the settlement agreement reached between LG&E, KU, Kentucky Industrial Utility Customers, Inc. and the Office of the Attorney General. The KPSC estimates that, pursuant to its modifications, electricity revenues would incorporate reductions of approximately $108 million for KU ( $87 million through the new bill credit and $21 million through existing rate mechanisms) and $79 million for LG&E ( $59 million through the new bill credit and $20 million through existing rate mechanisms). This represents $27 million ( $17 million at KU and $10 million at LG&E) in additional reductions from the amounts proposed by the settlement. The KPSC's modifications to the settlement include certain changes in assumptions or inputs used in assessing tax reform or calculating LG&E's and KU's electricity rates. LG&E gas rate reductions were not modified significantly from the amount included in the settlement agreement. On September 28, 2018, the KPSC issued an Order on reconsideration, pursuant to LG&E's and KU's petition, implementing rates reflecting electricity revenue reductions of $101 million for KU ( $80 million through the new bill credit and $21 million through existing rate mechanisms), $74 million for LG&E electricity revenues ( $54 million through the new bill credit and $20 million through existing rate mechanisms) and $16 million LG&E gas revenues (substantially all through the new bill credit) for the period January 2018 through April 2019. This represents lower revenue reduction amounts than the March 20, 2018 Order of approximately $13 million ( $7 million at KU and $6 million at LG&E). In January 2018, the VSCC ordered KU, as well as other utilities in Virginia, to accrue regulatory liabilities reflecting the Virginia jurisdictional revenue requirement impacts of the reduced federal corporate tax rate. In March 2018, KU reached a settlement agreement regarding its rate case in Virginia. New rates, inclusive of TCJA impacts, were effective June 1, 2018. The settlement also stipulates that actual tax savings for the five month period prior to new rates taking effect would be addressed through KU's annual information filing for calendar year 2018. In May 2018, the VSCC approved the settlement agreement. The TCJA and rate case are not expected to have a significant impact on KU's financial condition or results of operations related to Virginia. On November 15, 2018, the FERC issued a Policy Statement which stated that the appropriate ratemaking treatment for changes in accumulated deferred income taxes as a result of the TCJA will be addressed in a Notice of Proposed Rulemaking. Also on November 15, 2018, the FERC issued the Notice of Proposed Rulemaking which proposes that public utility transmission providers include mechanisms in their formula rates to deduct excess accumulated deferred income taxes from, or add deficient accumulated deferred income taxes to, rate base and adjust their income tax allowances by amortized excess or deficient accumulated deferred income taxes. The Notice of Proposed Rulemaking did not prescribe the mechanism companies should use to adjust their formula rates. LG&E and KU are currently assessing the Notice of Proposed Rulemaking and are continuing to monitor guidance issued by the FERC. On February 5, 2019, in connection with a separate element of federal and Kentucky state tax reform effects, LG&E and KU filed a request with the FERC to amend their transmission formula rates, effective June 1, 2019, to incorporate reductions to corporate income tax rates as a result of the TCJA and HB 487. LG&E and KU do not anticipate the impact of the TCJA related to their FERC-jurisdictional rates to be significant. 41 Table of Contents (PPL and PPL Electric) TCJA Impact on PPL Electric Rates On February 12, 2018, the PUC issued a Secretarial Letter requesting certain information from regulated utilities and inviting comment from interested parties on potential revision to customer rates as a result of enactment of the TCJA. PPL Electric submitted its response to the Secretarial Letter on March 9, 2018. On March 15, 2018, the PUC issued a Temporary Rates Order to allow time to determine the manner in which rates could be adjusted in response to the TCJA. The PUC issued another Temporary Rates Order on May 17, 2018 to address the impact of the TCJA and indicated that utilities without a currently pending general rate proceeding would receive a utility specific order. The PUC issued an Order specific to PPL Electric on May 17, 2018 that required PPL Electric to file a tariff or tariff supplement by June 15, 2018 to establish (a) temporary rates to be effective July 1, 2018, and (b) to record a deferred regulatory liability to reflect the tax savings associated with the TCJA for the period January 1 through June 30, 2018. On June 8, 2018, PPL Electric submitted a petition to the PUC to charge a negative surcharge of 7.05% to reflect the estimated 2018 tax savings associated with the TCJA. The PUC approved PPL Electric's petition on June 14, 2018 and PPL Electric filed a tariff on June 15, 2018 reflecting the increased negative surcharge. PPL Electric recorded a $41 million noncurrent regulatory liability and a corresponding reduction of revenue to be distributed to customers pursuant to a future rate adjustment related to the period January 1, 2018 through June 30, 2018. On March 15, 2018, the FERC issued a Notice of Inquiry seeking information on whether and how it should address changes to FERC-jurisdictional rates relating to accumulated deferred income taxes and bonus depreciation resulting from passage of the TCJA. On March 16, 2018, PPL Electric filed a waiver request, pursuant to Rule 207(a)(5) of the Rules of Practice and Procedure of the FERC, to accelerate incorporation of the changes to the federal corporate income tax rate in its transmission formula rate commencing on June 1, 2018 rather than allowing the TCJA tax rate reduction to be initially incorporated in PPL Electric's June 1, 2019 transmission formula rate. The waiver was approved on April 23, 2018 and PPL Electric submitted its transmission formula rate, reflecting the TCJA rate reduction, on April 27, 2018. In addition, on May 21, 2018, PPL Electric, as part of a PJM Transmission Owners joint filing, submitted comments in response to the FERC's March 15, 2018 Notice of Inquiry. The filing requested guidance on how the reduction in accumulated deferred income taxes, resulting from the TCJA reduced federal corporate income tax rate, should be treated for ratemaking purposes. On November 15, 2018, the FERC issued a Policy Statement which stated that the appropriate ratemaking treatment for changes in accumulated deferred income taxes as a result of the TCJA will be addressed in a Notice of Proposed Rulemaking. Also on November 15, 2018, the FERC issued the Notice of Proposed Rulemaking which proposes that public utility transmission providers should include mechanisms in their formula rates to deduct excess accumulated deferred income taxes from, or add deficient accumulated deferred income taxes to, rate base and adjust their income tax allowances by amortized excess or deficient accumulated deferred income taxes. The Notice of Proposed Rulemaking did not prescribe the mechanism companies should use to adjust their formula rates. PPL Electric is currently assessing the Notice of Proposed Rulemaking and is continuing to monitor guidance issued by the FERC. The changes, related to accumulated deferred income taxes impacting the transmission formula rate revenues, have not been significant since the new rate went into effect on June 1, 2018. Pennsylvania Alternative Ratemaking In June 2018, Governor Tom Wolf signed House Bill 1782 (now known as Act 58 of 2018, and to be codified at 66 Pa. C.S. 1330) authorizing public utilities to implement alternative rates and rate mechanisms in base rate proceedings before the PUC. The effective date of Act 58 was August 27, 2018. Under the new law, a public utility may file an application to establish alternative rates and rate mechanisms in a base rate proceeding. These alternative rates and rate mechanisms include, but are not limited to, the following: decoupling mechanisms, performance-based rates, formula rates, multi-year rate plans, or a combination of those or other mechanisms. The alternative rate mechanisms may include reconcilable surcharges and rates established under current law, including returns on and return of capital investments. Act 58 explicitly provides that it does not invalidate or void any rate mechanisms approved by the PUC prior to the legislation's effective date. Act 58 also specifies customer notice requirements concerning the utility's application for alternative rates or rate mechanisms. On August 23, 2018, the PUC issued a Tentative Implementation Order seeking comments on its proposed interpretation and implementation of Act 58, Section 1330 of the Public Utility Code, 66 Pa. C.S. 1330. PPL Electric and various other parties filed comments on October 8, 2018. This matter remains pending before the PUC. PPL Electric views the passage of Act 58 to be a favorable regulatory development that is expected to expand the rate-making mechanisms available to Pennsylvania regulated utility companies. 42 Table of Contents (PPL) RIIO-ED1 Mid-period Review The RIIO framework allowed for an MPR. On April 30, 2018, Ofgem announced its decision not to conduct an MPR of the RIIO-ED1 price control period. RIIO-2 Framework Review On March 7, 2018, Ofgem issued its consultation document on the RIIO-2 framework, which covers all U.K. gas and electricity transmission and distribution price controls. The current electricity distribution price control, RIIO-ED1, continues through March 31, 2023 and will not be impacted by this RIIO-2 consultation process. Ofgem consulted on a wide range of issues, including cost of debt and equity methodologies, the length of the price control period, indexation methodologies, innovation, stakeholder engagement in the business planning process and performance incentive mechanisms. The purpose of the RIIO-2 framework consultation was to build on lessons learned from the current price controls while supporting low costs to consumers, improved customer service and reliability, and the U.K.'s continued shift to a low-carbon future. Comments on the RIIO-2 framework were due in May 2018. On July 30, 2018, Ofgem published its decision following its RIIO-2 framework consultation after consideration of comments received. Ofgem confirmed the following points in the decision document: There will be a five-year default length for the price control period, compared to eight years in the current RIIO-ED1 price control. There is intent to shift the inflation index used for calculating RAV and allowed returns from RPI to CPIH. Ofgem stated overall, consumers and investors as a whole will be neither better nor worse off in net present value terms as a result of the shift to CPIH and a transition period may be required. There will be no change to the existing depreciation policy of using economic asset lives as the basis for depreciating RAV as part of base revenue calculations. WPD is currently transitioning to 45 year asset lives for new additions in RIIO-ED1 based on Ofgem extensive review of asset lives in RIIO-ED1. Ofgem will retain the option for fast-tracking for electricity distribution companies only. Fast tracking will be further considered as part of the electricity distribution sector specific consultation. A new enhanced engagement model will be introduced which will require distribution companies to set up a customer engagement group to provide Ofgem with a public report of their views on the companies business plans from the perspective of local stakeholders. Ofgem will also establish an independent RIIO-2 challenge group comprised of consumer experts to provide Ofgem with a public report on companies business plans. Ofgem intends to expand the role of competition for projects that are new, separable and high value. WPD does not currently have any planned projects that would meet the high value threshold. A focus of RIIO-2 will be on whole-system outcomes. Ofgem envisions network companies and system operators working together to ensure the energy system as a whole is efficient and delivers best value to consumers. Ofgem is undertaking further work to clarify the definition of whole-system and the appropriate roles of the network companies in supporting the energy transition. Ofgem also indicated further work is needed on other price control principles, including but not limited to, cost of equity, cost of debt, financeability and incentives with decisions on these items expected to be made in the sector specific consultations or within the individual company business plan submissions. In December 2018, the promulgation of sector specific price controls began with Ofgem publishing its consultation related to its RIIO-2 price controls for the gas distribution, gas transmission and electricity transmission operators that will be effective from April 2021 to March 2026. This current consultation does not apply directly to electricity distribution network operators although some decisions will be precedent setting. The electricity distribution price control work is scheduled to begin in 2020, at which time Ofgem plans to publish its RIIO-ED2 strategy consultation document. Although the electricity distribution consultation does not commence until 2020, WPD is engaged in the RIIO-2 process and will be responding to the December 2018 consultation document. PPL cannot predict the outcome of this process or the long-term impact it or the final RIIO-ED2 regulations will have on its financial condition or results of operations. 43 Table of Contents (PPL, LKE, LG&E and KU) FERC Transmission Rate Filing On August 3, 2018, LG&E and KU submitted an application to the FERC requesting elimination of certain on-going credits to a sub-set of transmission customers relating to the 1998 merger of LG&E's and KU's parent entities and the 2006 withdrawal of LG&E and KU from the Midcontinent Independent System Operator, Inc. (MISO), a regional transmission operator and energy market. The application seeks termination of LG&E's and KU's commitment to provide mitigation for certain horizontal market power concerns arising out of the 1998 merger for certain transmission service between MISO and LG&E and KU. The affected transmission customers are a limited number of municipal entities in Kentucky. The amounts at issue are generally waivers or credits for either LG&E and KU or for MISO transmission charges depending upon the direction of transmission service incurred by the municipalities. LG&E and KU estimate that such charges may average approximately $22 million annually, depending upon actual transmission customer and market volumes, structures and prices, with such charges allocated according to LG&E's and KU's respective transmission system ownership ratio. Due to the development of robust accessible energy markets over time, LG&E and KU believe the mitigation commitments are no longer relevant or appropriate. LG&E and KU currently receive recovery of such expenses in other rate mechanisms. LG&E and KU cannot predict the outcome of the proceeding, including any effects on their financial condition or results of operations. The businesses of LKE, LG&E and KU are subject to extensive federal, state and local environmental laws, rules and regulations, including those pertaining to CCRs, GHG, and ELGs. See Note 7 , Note 13 and Note 19 to the Financial Statements for a discussion of these significant environmental matters. These and other stringent environmental requirements led PPL, LKE, LG&E and KU to retire approximately 800 MW of coal-fired generating plants in Kentucky, primarily in 2015. Additionally, KU anticipates retiring two older coal-fired units at the E.W. Brown plant in 2019 with a combined summer rating capacity of 272 MW. Also as a result of the environmental requirements discussed above, LKE projects $ 682 million ($ 261 million at LG&E and $ 421 million at KU) in environmental capital investment over the next five years. See PPL's "Financial Condition - Forecasted Uses of Cash - Capital Expenditures", Note 7 and Note 13 for additional information . Rate Case Proceedings (PPL, LKE, LG&E and KU) On September 28, 2018, LG&E and KU filed requests with the KPSC for an increase in annual base electricity rates of approximately $112 million at KU and increases in annual base electricity and gas rates of approximately $35 million and $25 million at LG&E. The proposed base rate increases would result in an electricity rate increase of 6.9% at KU and electricity and gas rate increases of 3% and 7.5% at LG&E. As discussed in the "TCJA Impact on LG&E and KU Rates" section above, LG&E's and KU's applications seek to include applicable changes associated with the TCJA in the calculation of the proposed base rates and to terminate the TCJA bill credit mechanism when the new base rates go into effect. New rates are expected to become effective on May 1, 2019. The applications are based on a forecasted test year of May 1, 2019 through April 30, 2020 with a requested return-on-equity of 10.42% . A number of parties have been granted intervention requests in the proceeding. Data discovery and the filing of written testimony will continue through February 2019 and a hearing is scheduled in March 2019. LG&E and KU cannot predict the outcome of these proceedings. (LKE and KU) In September 2017, KU filed a request seeking approval from the VSCC to increase annual Virginia base electricity revenue by $7 million, representing an increase of 10.4%. On March 22, 2018, KU reached a settlement agreement regarding the case, including the impact of the TCJA on rates, resulting in an increase in annual Virginia base electricity revenue of $2 million. This represents an increase of 2.8% with rates effective June 1, 2018. On May 8, 2018, the VSCC issued an Order approving the settlement agreement. Acquisition of Solar Energy Solution Provider (PPL) During the second quarter of 2018, PPL completed the acquisition of all the outstanding membership interests of Safari Energy, a privately held provider of solar energy solutions for commercial customers in the U.S. For its clients, Safari Energy develops highly structured turnkey solutions, managing projects through all phases of development, from inception to financing, design, engineering, permitting, construction, interconnection and asset management. Headquartered in New York City, Safari Energy 44 Table of Contents has completed over 200 solar projects in 19 states, with over 70 projects underway as of December 31, 2018. The acquisition is not material to PPL and the financial results of Safari Energy are reported within Corporate and Other. Results of Operations (PPL) The "Statement of Income Analysis" discussion below describes significant changes in principal line items on PPL's Statements of Income, comparing year-to-year changes. The "Segment Earnings" and "Adjusted Gross Margins" discussions for PPL provide a review of results by reportable segment. These discussions include non-GAAP financial measures, including "Earnings from Ongoing Operations" and "Adjusted Gross Margins," and provide explanations of the non-GAAP financial measures and a reconciliation of those measures to the most comparable GAAP measure. The " 2019 Outlook" discussion identifies key factors expected to impact 2019 earnings. Tables analyzing changes in amounts between periods within "Statement of Income Analysis," "Segment Earnings" and "Adjusted Gross Margins" are presented on a constant GBP to U.S. dollar exchange rate basis, where applicable, in order to isolate the impact of the change in the exchange rate on the item being explained. Results computed on a constant GBP to U.S. dollar exchange rate basis are calculated by translating current year results at the prior year weighted-average GBP to U.S. dollar exchange rate. (PPL Electric, LKE, LG&E and KU) A "Statement of Income Analysis, Earnings and Adjusted Gross Margins" is presented separately for PPL Electric, LKE, LG&E and KU. The "Statement of Income Analysis" discussion below describes significant changes in principal line items on the Statements of Income, comparing year-to-year changes. The "Earnings" discussion provides a summary of earnings. The "Adjusted Gross Margins" discussion includes a reconciliation of non-GAAP financial measures to "Operating Income." PPL: Statement of Income Analysis, Segment Earnings and Adjusted Gross Margins Statement of Income Analysis Net income for the years ended December 31 includes the following results.

(c) Increase in 2018 compared with 2017 was primarily due to higher energy purchase volumes. (d) Transmission Formula Rate revenues increased primarily from returns on additional transmission capital investments focused on replacing aging infrastructure and improving reliability and includes the impacts of the TCJA which reduced the new revenue requirement that went into effect June 1, 2018. (e) Represents income tax savings owed to or already returned to customers related to the impact of the U.S. federal corporate income tax rate reduction from 35% to 21%, as enacted by the TCJA, effective January 1, 2018. See Note 7 to the Financial Statements for additional information. (f) Increase primarily due to new base rates approved by the KPSC effective July 1, 2017. (g) These revenues are offset by costs reflected in "Other operation and maintenance" on the Statement of Income. Fuel Fuel increased $40 million in 2018 compared with 2017, primarily due to an increase in volumes at LKE driven by weather in 2018. Fuel decreased $32 million in 2017 compared with 2016, primarily due to a decrease in volumes at LKE driven by weather in 2017. Energy Purchases Energy purchases increased $ 60 million in 2018 compared with 2017 primarily due to an increase of $37 million at PPL Electric primarily due to higher energy volumes and an increase of $23 million at LKE primarily due to higher gas volumes driven by weather in 2018. Energy purchases decreased $ 21 million in 2017 compared with 2016 primarily due to a decrease in PLR prices at PPL Electric. 46 Table of Contents Other Operation and Maintenance The increase (decrease) in other operation and maintenance was due to: 2018 vs. 2017 2017 vs. 2016 Domestic: PPL Electric Act 129 $ 1 $ 9 PPL Electric Payroll-related costs (5 ) (14 ) PPL Electric Bad debts 11 (17 ) PPL Electric Inventory reserve 8 (2 ) LKE timing and scope of generation maintenance outages 8 (1 ) LKE gas distribution maintenance and compliance 7 3 LKE electricity distribution outage and repairs 7 Storm costs 12 4 Vegetation management 5 (15 ) Stock compensation expense (7 ) 5 Other operation and maintenance of Safari Energy (a) 30 Other 23 (10 ) U.K.: Pension expense (2 ) 3 Foreign currency exchange rates 20 (28 ) Third-party engineering (b) 35 6 Engineering management 13 3 Other 15 (1 ) Total $ 181 $ (55 ) (a) The increase in 2018 compared with 2017 primarily represents the other operation and maintenance expense of Safari Energy, which was acquired on June 1, 2018. (b) These costs are offset by revenues reflected in "Operating Revenues" on the Statement of Income. Depreciation The increase (decrease) in depreciation was due to: 2018 vs. 2017 2017 vs. 2016 Additions to PP&E, net $ 65 $ 93 Foreign currency exchange rates 11 (16 ) Depreciation rates (a) 15 15 Other (5 ) (10 ) Total $ 86 $ 82 (a) Higher depreciation rates were effective July 1, 2017 at LG&E and KU.

Interest expense increased in 2017 compared with 2016, primarily due to accretion on Index linked bonds at WPD and a debt issuance at PPL Electric in May 2017. Income Taxes The increase (decrease) in income taxes was due to: 2018 vs. 2017 2017 vs. 2016 Change in pre-tax income at current period tax rates $ (57 ) $ (223 ) Reduction in U.S. federal income tax rate (a) (138 ) Valuation allowance adjustments (b) (15 ) 20 Foreign income tax return adjustments 8 (10 ) U.S. income tax on foreign earnings net of foreign tax credit(c) (44 ) 89 Impact of U.K. Finance Acts (d) 3 33 Impact of lower U.K. income tax rates (e) 151 1 Amortization of excess deferred income tax (f) (37 ) Deferred tax impact of U.S. tax reform (g) (220 ) 220 Deferred tax impact of Kentucky state tax reform (h) 9 Stock-based compensation 7 7 Other 7 (1 ) Total $ (326 ) $ 136 (a) The decrease in 2018 compared with 2017 is related to the impact of the U.S. federal corporate income tax rate reduction from 35% to 21%, as enacted by the TCJA, effective January 1, 2018. (b) During 2017, PPL recorded an increase in valuation allowances of $23 million primarily related to foreign tax credits recorded in 2016. The future utilization of these credits is expected to be lower as a result of the TCJA. During 2018, 2017 and 2016, PPL recorded deferred income tax expense of $24 million , $16 million and $13 million for valuation allowances primarily related to increased Pennsylvania net operating loss carryforwards expected to be unutilized. (c) During 2017, PPL recorded a federal income tax benefit of $35 million primarily attributable to UK pension contributions. During 2017, PPL recorded deferred income tax expense of $83 million primarily related to enactment of the TCJA. The enacted tax law included a conversion from a worldwide tax system to a territorial tax system, effective January 1, 2018. In the transition to the territorial regime, a one-time transition tax was imposed on PPL unrepatriated accumulated foreign earnings in 2017. These earnings were treated as a taxable deemed dividend to PPL of approximately $462 million, including $205 million of foreign tax credits. As the PPL consolidated U.S. group had a taxable loss for 2017, 48 Table of Contents inclusive of the taxable deemed dividend, these credits were recorded as a deferred tax asset. However, it is expected that under the TCJA, only $83 million of the $205 million of foreign tax credits will be realized in the carry forward period. Accordingly, a valuation allowance on the current year foreign tax credits in the amount of $122 million has been recorded to reflect the reduction in the future utilization of the credits. The foreign tax credits associated with the deemed repatriation result in a gross carryforward and corresponding deferred tax asset of $205 million offset by a valuation allowance of $122 million. During 2016, PPL recorded a federal income tax benefit of $40 million attributable to the foreign tax credit carrryforwards, arising from a decision to amend prior year tax returns to claim foreign tax credits rather than deduct foreign taxes. This decision was prompted by changes to the company's most recent business plan. (d) The U.K. Finance Act 2016, enacted in September 2016, reduced the U.K. statutory income tax rate effective April 1, 2020 to 17%. As a result, PPL reduced its net deferred tax liabilities and recognized a $42 million deferred income tax benefit during 2016. (e) The reduction in the U.S. federal corporate income tax rate from 35% to 21% significantly reduced the difference between the U.K. and U.S. income tax rates in 2018 compared with 2017. (f) During 2018, PPL recorded lower income tax expense for the amortization of excess deferred income taxes that primarily resulted from the U.S. federal corporate income tax rate reduction from 35% to 21% enacted by the TCJA. (g) During 2017, PPL recorded deferred income tax expense for the U.S. federal corporate income tax rate reduction from 35% to 21% enacted by the TCJA. (h) During 2018, PPL recorded deferred income tax expense, primarily associated with LKE non-regulated entities, due to the Kentucky corporate income tax rate reduction from 6% to 5%, as enacted by HB 487, effective January 1, 2018. See Note 6 to the Financial Statements for additional information on income taxes. Segment Earnings PPL's net income by reportable segments were as follows: Change 2018 2017 2016 2018 vs. 2017 2017 vs. 2016 U.K. Regulated $ 1,114 $ 652 $ 1,246 $ 462 $ (594 ) Kentucky Regulated 411 286 398 125 (112 ) Pennsylvania Regulated 431 359 338 72 21 Corporate and Other (a) (129 ) (169 ) (80 ) 40 (89 ) Net Income $ 1,827 $ 1,128 $ 1,902 $ 699 $ (774 ) (a) Primarily represents financing and certain other costs incurred at the corporate level that have not been allocated or assigned to the segments, which are presented to reconcile segment information to PPL's consolidated results. The increase in 2018 compared with 2017 was primarily due to lower income tax expense of $82 million, partially offset by higher interest expense of $15 million, Talen Montana litigation costs of $9 million and higher charitable contributions of $6 million. 2017 includes $97 million of additional income tax expense related to the enactment of the TCJA. See Note 6 to the Financial Statements for additional information. Earnings from Ongoing Operations Management utilizes "Earnings from Ongoing Operations" as a non-GAAP financial measure that should not be considered as an alternative to net income, an indicator of operating performance determined in accordance with GAAP. PPL believes that Earnings from Ongoing Operations is useful and meaningful to investors because it provides management's view of PPL's earnings performance as another criterion in making investment decisions. In addition, PPL's management uses Earnings from Ongoing Operations in measuring achievement of certain corporate performance goals, including targets for certain executive incentive compensation. Other companies may use different measures to present financial performance. Earnings from Ongoing Operations is adjusted for the impact of special items. Special items are presented in the financial tables on an after-tax basis with the related income taxes on special items separately disclosed. Income taxes on special items, when applicable, are calculated based on the effective tax rate of the entity where the activity is recorded. Special items include: Unrealized gains or losses on foreign currency economic hedges (as discussed below). Spinoff of the Supply segment. Gains and losses on sales of assets not in the ordinary course of business. Impairment charges. Significant workforce reduction and other restructuring effects. Acquisition and divestiture-related adjustments. Other charges or credits that are, in management's view, non-recurring or otherwise not reflective of the company's ongoing operations. 49 Table of Contents Unrealized gains or losses on foreign currency economic hedges include the changes in fair value of foreign currency contracts used to hedge GBP-denominated anticipated earnings. The changes in fair value of these contracts are recognized immediately within GAAP earnings. Management believes that excluding these amounts from Earnings from Ongoing Operations until settlement of the contracts provides a better matching of the financial impacts of those contracts with the economic value of PPL's underlying hedged earnings. See Note 17 to the Financial Statements and "Risk Management" below for additional information on foreign currency economic activity. PPL's Earnings from Ongoing Operations by reportable segment were as follows: Change 2018 2017 2016 2018 vs. 2017 2017 vs. 2016 U.K. Regulated $ 968 $ 885 $ 1,015 $ 83 $ (130 ) Kentucky Regulated 418 395 398 23 (3 ) Pennsylvania Regulated 436 349 338 87 11 Corporate and Other (117 ) (76 ) (77 ) (41 ) 1 Earnings from Ongoing Operations $ 1,705 $ 1,553 $ 1,674 $ 152 $ (121 ) See "Reconciliation of Earnings from Ongoing Operations" below for a reconciliation of this non-GAAP financial measure to Net Income. U.K. Regulated Segment The U.K. Regulated segment consists of PPL Global, which primarily includes WPD's regulated electricity distribution operations, the results of hedging the translation of WPD's earnings from GBP into U.S. dollars, and certain costs, such as U.S. income taxes, administrative costs, and certain acquisition-related financing costs. The U.K. Regulated segment represents 61% of PPL's Net Income for 2018 and 38% of PPL's assets at December 31, 2018 . Net Income and Earnings from Ongoing Operations include the following results. Change 2018 2017 2016 2018 vs. 2017 2017 vs. 2016 Operating revenues $ 2,268 $ 2,091 $ 2,207 $ 177 $ (116 ) Other operation and maintenance 538 449 465 89 (16 ) Depreciation 247 230 233 17 (3 ) Taxes, other than income 134 127 135 7 (8 ) Total operating expenses 919 806 833 113 (27 ) Other Income (Expense) - net 403 (84 ) 507 487 (591 ) Interest Expense 413 397 402 16 (5 ) Income Taxes 225 152 233 73 (81 ) Net Income 1,114 652 1,246 462 (594 ) Less: Special Items 146 (233 ) 231 379 (464 ) Earnings from Ongoing Operations $ 968 $ 885 $ 1,015 $ 83 $ (130 ) The following after-tax gains (losses), which management considers special items, impacted the U.K. Regulated segment's results and are excluded from Earnings from Ongoing Operations.

(b) During 2018, PPL recorded adjustments to certain provisional amounts recognized in the December 31, 2017 Statement of Income relating to the enactment of the TCJA. 50 Table of Contents During 2017, PPL recorded deferred income tax expense for the enactment of the TCJA. See Note 6 to the Financial Statements for additional information. (c) In 2016, PPL settled 2017 and 2018 foreign currency contracts, resulting in $310 million of cash received ($202 million after-tax). The settlement did not have a material impact on net income as the contracts were previously marked to fair value and recognized in "Other Income (Expense) - net" on the Statement of Income. See Note 17 to the Financial Statements for additional information. (d) The U.K. Finance Act of 2016 reduced the U.K.'s statutory income tax rate. As a result, PPL reduced its net deferred tax liability and recognized a deferred tax benefit in 2016. See Note 6 to the Financial Statements for additional information. (e) Primarily a payment related to the death of the WPD Chief Executive. The changes in the components of the U.K. Regulated segment's results between these periods were due to the factors set forth below, which reflect amounts classified as U.K. Adjusted Gross Margins, the items that management considers special and the effects of movements in foreign currency exchange, including the effects of foreign currency hedge contracts, on separate lines and not in their respective Statement of Income line items. 2018 vs. 2017 2017 vs. 2016 U.K. Adjusted Gross Margins $ 39 $ 30 Other operation and maintenance (18 ) (5 ) Depreciation (6 ) (14 ) Other Income (Expense) - net 63 69 Interest expense 1 (21 ) Other (4 ) (6 ) Income taxes (23 ) 11 U.S. Interest expense and other (8 ) 1 Income taxes (48 ) (10 ) Foreign currency exchange, after-tax 87 (185 ) Earnings from Ongoing Operations 83 (130 ) Special items, after-tax 379 (464 ) Net Income $ 462 $ (594 ) U.K. See "Adjusted Gross Margins - Changes in Adjusted Gross Margins" for an explanation of U.K. Adjusted Gross Margins. Higher depreciation expense in 2017 compared with 2016 primarily due to additions to PP&E, net of retirements. Higher other income (expense) - net in 2018 compared with 2017 primarily due to higher pension income due to an increase in expected returns on higher asset balances. Higher other income (expense) - net in 2017 compared with 2016 primarily due to higher pension income due to an increase in expected returns on higher asset balances and lower interest costs due to a lower discount rate. Higher interest expense in 2017 compared with 2016 primarily due to higher interest expense on indexed linked bonds. Higher income taxes in 2018 compared with 2017 primarily due to higher pre-tax income. Lower income taxes in 2017 compared with 2016 primarily due to decreases of $10 million related to accelerated tax deductions and $7 million from lower U.K. tax rates, partially offset by an increase of $11 million from higher pre-tax income. U.S. Higher income taxes in 2018 compared with 2017 primarily due to a $35 million tax benefit on accelerated pension contributions in the first quarter of 2017 and a $16 million increase from a reduction in tax benefits on interest deductibility due to the U.S. federal corporate income tax rate reduction from 35% to 21%, as enacted by the TCJA, effective January 1, 2018. 51 Table of Contents Higher income taxes in 2017 compared with 2016 primarily due to a $37 million benefit related to foreign tax credit carryforwards in 2016, partially offset by a $29 million tax benefit on accelerated pension contributions made in the first quarter of 2017. Kentucky Regulated Segment The Kentucky Regulated segment consists primarily of LKE's regulated electricity generation, transmission and distribution operations of LG&E and KU, as well as LG&E's regulated distribution and sale of natural gas. In addition, certain acquisition-related financing costs are allocated to the Kentucky Regulated segment. The Kentucky Regulated segment represents 22% of PPL's Net Income for 2018 and 35% of PPL's assets at December 31, 2018 .

Higher other operation and maintenance expense in 2018 compared with 2017 primarily due to an $8 million increase in vegetation management, an $8 million increase in timing and scope of generation maintenance outages, a $7 million increase in gas distribution maintenance and compliance, a $7 million increase in electricity distribution outage and repairs and increases in other costs that were not individually significant in comparison to the prior year. Higher depreciation expense in 2018 compared with 2017 primarily due to a $16 million increase related to additional assets placed into service, net of retirements, and a $12 million increase related to higher depreciation rates effective July 1, 2017. Higher depreciation expense in 2017 compared with 2016 primarily due to a $15 million increase related to additional assets placed into service, net of retirements, and a $12 million increase related to higher depreciation rates effective July 1, 2017. Higher interest expense in 2018 compared with 2017 primarily due to increased borrowings under LG&E's term loan credit facility and from affiliates. Lower income taxes in 2018 compared with 2017 primarily due to a $74 million decrease related to the impact of the U.S. federal corporate income tax rate reduction from 35% to 21%, as enacted by the TCJA, effective January 1, 2018, a $42 million decrease related to lower pre-tax income and an $18 million decrease primarily related to higher amortization of excess deferred income taxes as a result of the TCJA. Pennsylvania Regulated Segment The Pennsylvania Regulated segment includes the regulated electricity transmission and distribution operations of PPL Electric. In addition, certain costs are allocated to the Pennsylvania Regulated segment. The Pennsylvania Regulated segment represents 24% of PPL's Net Income for 2018 and 26% of PPL's assets at December 31, 2018 . Net Income and Earnings from Ongoing Operations include the following results. 53 Table of Contents Change 2018 2017 2016 2018 vs. 2017 2017 vs. 2016 Operating revenues $ 2,277 $ 2,195 $ 2,156 $ 82 $ 39 Energy purchases 544 507 535 37 (28 ) Other operation and maintenance 578 572 604 6 (32 ) Depreciation 352 309 253 43 56 Taxes, other than income 109 107 105 2 2 Total operating expenses 1,583 1,495 1,497 88 (2 ) Other Income (Expense) - net 32 17 20 15 (3 ) Interest Expense 159 142 129 17 13 Income Taxes 136 216 212 (80 ) 4 Net Income 431 359 338 72 21 Less: Special Items (5 ) 10 (15 ) 10 Earnings from Ongoing Operations $ 436 $ 349 $ 338 $ 87 $ 11 The following after-tax gains (losses), which management considers special items, impacted the Pennsylvania Regulated segment's results and are excluded from Earnings from Ongoing Operations.

Lower other operation and maintenance expense in 2018 compared with 2017 primarily due to $36 million of lower corporate service costs allocated to PPL Electric, partially offset by $11 million of higher non-recoverable storm expenses and $11 million of higher bad debt expense. Lower other operation and maintenance expense in 2017 compared with 2016 primarily due to $17 million of lower bad debt expense, $17 million of lower vegetation management expenses and $14 million of lower payroll expenses, partially offset by $19 million of higher corporate service costs allocated to PPL Electric. 54 Table of Contents Higher depreciation expense in 2018 compared with 2017 and 2017 compared with 2016 primarily due to additional assets placed into service, related to the ongoing efforts to ensure the reliability of the delivery system and the replacement of aging infrastructure, net of retirements. Higher interest expense in 2018 compared with 2017 primarily due to the May 2017 issuance of $475 million of 3.95% First Mortgage Bonds and the June 2018 issuance of $400 million of 4.15% First Mortgage Bonds. Higher interest expense in 2017 compared with 2016 primarily due to the issuance of $475 million of 3.95% First Mortgage Bonds in May 2017. Lower income taxes in 2018 compared with 2017 primarily due to the impact of the U.S federal corporate income tax rate reduction from 35% to 21%, as enacted by the TCJA, effective January 1, 2018 of $71 million and $18 million of lower income taxes due to amortization of excess deferred income taxes. Higher income taxes in 2017 compared with 2016 primarily due to higher pre-tax income at current period tax rates.

"U.K. Adjusted Gross Margins" is a single financial performance measure of the electricity distribution operations of the U.K. Regulated segment. In calculating this measure, direct costs such as connection charges from National Grid, which owns and manages the electricity transmission network in England and Wales, and Ofgem license fees (recorded in "Other operation and maintenance" on the Statements of Income) are deducted from operating revenues, as they are costs passed through to customers. As a result, this measure represents the net revenues from the delivery of electricity across WPD's distribution network in the U.K. and directly related activities. "Kentucky Adjusted Gross Margins" is a single financial performance measure of the electricity generation, transmission and distribution operations of the Kentucky Regulated segment, LKE, LG&E and KU, as well as the Kentucky Regulated segment's, LKE's and LG&E's distribution and sale of natural gas. In calculating this measure, fuel, energy purchases and certain variable costs of production (recorded in "Other operation and maintenance" on the Statements of Income) are deducted from operating revenues. In addition, certain other expenses, recorded in "Other operation and maintenance", "Depreciation" and "Taxes, other than income" on the Statements of Income, associated with approved cost recovery mechanisms are offset against the recovery of those expenses, which are included in revenues. These mechanisms allow for direct recovery of these expenses and, in some cases, returns on capital investments and performance incentives. As a result, this measure represents the net revenues from electricity and gas operations. "Pennsylvania Adjusted Gross Margins" is a single financial performance measure of the electricity transmission and distribution operations of the Pennsylvania Regulated segment and PPL Electric. In calculating this measure, utility revenues and expenses associated with approved recovery mechanisms, including energy provided as a PLR, are offset with minimal impact on earnings. Costs associated with these mechanisms are recorded in "Energy purchases," "Other operation and maintenance," (which are primarily Act 129, Storm Damage and Universal Service program costs), "Depreciation" (which is primarily related to the Act 129 Smart Meter program) and "Taxes, other than income," (which is primarily gross receipts tax) on the Statements of Income. This measure represents the net revenues from the Pennsylvania Regulated segment's and PPL Electric's electricity delivery operations. These measures are not intended to replace "Operating Income," which is determined in accordance with GAAP, as an indicator of overall operating performance. Other companies may use different measures to analyze and report their results of operations. Management believes these measures provide additional useful criteria to make investment decisions. These performance measures are used, in conjunction with other information, by senior management and PPL's Board of Directors to manage operations and analyze actual results compared with budget. 56 Table of Contents Changes in Adjusted Gross Margins The following table shows Adjusted Gross Margins by PPL's reportable segments and by component, as applicable, for the year ended December 31 as well as the changes between periods. The factors that gave rise to the changes are described following the table. Change 2018 2017 2016 2018 vs. 2017 2017 vs. 2016 U.K. Regulated U.K. Adjusted Gross Margins $ 2,089 $ 1,952 $ 2,067 $ 137 $ (115 ) Impact of changes in foreign currency exchange rates 98 (145 ) U.K. Adjusted Gross Margins excluding impact of foreign currency exchange rates $ 39 $ 30 Kentucky Regulated Kentucky Adjusted Gross Margins LG&E $ 922 $ 910 $ 887 $ 12 $ 23 KU 1,119 1,128 1,122 (9 ) 6 Total Kentucky Adjusted Gross Margins $ 2,041 $ 2,038 $ 2,009 $ 3 $ 29 Pennsylvania Regulated Pennsylvania Adjusted Gross Margins Distribution $ 924 $ 958 $ 960 $ (34 ) $ (2 ) Transmission 549 487 454 62 33 Total Pennsylvania Adjusted Gross Margins $ 1,473 $ 1,445 $ 1,414 $ 28 $ 31 U.K. Adjusted Gross Margins U.K. Adjusted Gross Margins, excluding the impact of changes in foreign currency exchange rates, increased in 2018 compared with 2017 primarily due to $52 million from the April 1, 2018 price increase, partially offset by $10 million from the April 1, 2017 price decrease, driven by lower true-up mechanisms partially offset by higher base demand revenue. U.K. Adjusted Gross Margins, excluding the impact of changes in foreign currency exchange rates, increased in 2017 compared with 2016 primarily due to $81 million from the April 1, 2016 price increase, partially offset by $30 million from lower volumes and $21 million from the April 1, 2017 price decrease, which includes lower true-up mechanisms partially offset by higher base demand revenue. Kentucky Adjusted Gross Margins Kentucky Adjusted Gross Margins increased in 2018 compared with 2017 primarily due to $63 million of increased sales volumes related to favorable weather in 2018 ($23 million at LG&E and $40 million at KU), higher base rates of $58 million ($32 million at LG&E and $26 million at KU) as new base rates were approved by the KPSC effective July 1, 2017, returns on additional environmental capital investments of $19 million ($12 million at LG&E and $7 million at KU) and other factors that were not individually significant in comparison to the prior year, partially offset by $143 million of income tax savings owed to customers ($67 million at LG&E and $76 million at KU) related to the impact of U.S. federal corporate income tax rate reduction from 35% to 21%, as enacted by the TCJA, effective January 1, 2018. Kentucky Adjusted Gross Margins increased in 2017 compared with 2016 primarily due to higher base rates of $58 million ($32 million at LG&E and $26 million at KU) as new base rates were approved by the KPSC effective July 1, 2017 and gas cost recoveries added to base rates of $5 million at LG&E, partially offset by $41 million of lower sales volumes due to milder weather in 2017 ($15 million at LG&E and $26 million at KU). 57 Table of Contents Pennsylvania Adjusted Gross Margins Distribution Distribution Adjusted Gross Margins decreased in 2018 compared with 2017 primarily due to a $37 million net of gross receipts tax impact of the estimated income tax savings owed to customers for the period January 1, 2018 through June 30, 2018 and $38 million from the negative surcharge beginning on July 1, 2018, as a result of the impact of the U.S. federal corporate income tax rate reduction from 35% to 21%, as enacted by the TCJA. These decreases were partially offset by $43 million of higher electricity sales volumes primarily due to weather. Distribution Adjusted Gross margins decreased in 2017 compared with 2016 primarily due to $10 million of lower electricity sales volumes due to milder weather in 2017, partially offset by $7 million of returns on additional Smart Meter capital investments. Transmission Transmission Adjusted Gross Margins increased in 2018 compared with 2017 primarily due to increases of $78 million from returns on additional transmission capital investments focused on replacing aging infrastructure and improving reliability and $25 million as a result of a higher annual PPL zonal peak load billing factor in the first five months of 2018, partially offset by $38 million from the impact of the reduced federal income taxes as a result of the TCJA. Transmission Adjusted Gross Margins increased in 2017 compared with 2016 primarily due to an increase of $51 million from returns on additional transmission capital investments focused on replacing aging infrastructure and improving reliability, partially offset by a $17 million decrease as a result of a lower annual PPL zonal peak load billing factor which affected transmission revenue in the first five months of 2017.

(b) As reported on the Statements of Income. (c) 2018, 2017 and 2016 exclude $38 million, $41 million and $42 million of ancillary revenues. 2019 Outlook (PPL) Lower net income is projected in 2019 compared with 2018 . The decrease in net income primarily reflects the 2018 favorable impact of unrealized gains on foreign currency economic hedges. Excluding 2018 special items, net income is expected to increase primarily attributable to increases in the U.K. Regulated segment and the Corporate and Other category. The following projections and factors underlying these projections (on an after-tax basis) are provided for PPL's segments and the Corporate and Other category and the related Registrants. (PPL's U.K. Regulated Segment) Lower net income is projected in 2019 compared with 2018 . The decrease in net income reflects the 2018 favorable impact of unrealized gains on foreign currency economic hedges. Excluding 2018 special items, net income is expected to increase driven primarily by higher revenues from higher prices, higher pension income and higher assumed GBP exchange rates, partially offset by higher interest expense and higher income taxes. (PPL's Kentucky Regulated Segment and LKE, LG&E and KU) Comparable net income is projected in 2019 compared with 2018 , primarily driven by higher base electricity and gas rates and returns on additional environmental capital investments, offset by an assumed return to normal weather, higher operation and maintenance expense, higher depreciation expense and higher interest expense. 59 Table of Contents (PPL's Pennsylvania Regulated Segment and PPL Electric) Comparable net income is projected in 2019 compared with 2018 , driven primarily by higher returns on transmission investments and lower operation and maintenance expense, offset by higher depreciation expense and an assumed return to normal weather. (PPL's Corporate and Other Category) Lower costs are projected in 2019 compared with 2018 , driven primarily by lower expenses and other factors. (All Registrants) Earnings in future periods are subject to various risks and uncertainties. See "Forward-Looking Information," "Item 1. Business," "Item 1A. Risk Factors," the rest of this Item 7, and Notes 1 , 7 and 13 to the Financial Statements (as applicable) for a discussion of the risks, uncertainties and factors that may impact future earnings.

Projected Total 2019 (b) 2020 2021 2022 2023 PPL Construction expenditures (a) Generating facilities $ 855 $ 268 $ 157 $ 193 $ 107 $ 130 Distribution facilities 9,327 1,899 1,843 1,880 1,832 1,873 Transmission facilities 3,238 867 892 630 482 367 Environmental 682 198 112 109 148 115 Other 449 101 109 104 72 63 Total Capital Expenditures $ 14,551 $ 3,333 $ 3,113 $ 2,916 $ 2,641 $ 2,548 81 Table of Contents Projected Total 2019 (b) 2020 2021 2022 2023 PPL Electric (a) Distribution facilities $ 1,946 $ 430 $ 408 $ 402 $ 403 $ 303 Transmission facilities 2,415 698 702 406 362 247 Total Capital Expenditures $ 4,361 $ 1,128 $ 1,110 $ 808 $ 765 $ 550 LKE Generating facilities $ 855 $ 268 $ 157 $ 193 $ 107 $ 130 Distribution facilities 1,816 432 370 395 305 314 Transmission facilities 823 169 190 224 120 120 Environmental 682 198 112 109 148 115 Other 425 97 101 97 70 60 Total Capital Expenditures $ 4,601 $ 1,164 $ 930 $ 1,018 $ 750 $ 739 LG&E Generating facilities $ 381 $ 107 $ 62 $ 93 $ 58 $ 61 Distribution facilities 1,165 287 239 262 187 190 Transmission facilities 173 37 34 42 27 33 Environmental 261 71 39 54 67 30 Other 201 47 49 46 32 27 Total Capital Expenditures $ 2,181 $ 549 $ 423 $ 497 $ 371 $ 341 KU Generating facilities $ 474 $ 161 $ 95 $ 100 $ 49 $ 69 Distribution facilities 651 145 131 133 118 124 Transmission facilities 650 132 156 182 93 87 Environmental 421 127 73 55 81 85 Other 200 45 48 47 33 27 Total Capital Expenditures $ 2,396 $ 610 $ 503 $ 517 $ 374 $ 392 (a) Construction expenditures include capitalized interest and AFUDC, which are expected to total approximately $81 million for PPL and $50 million for PPL Electric. (b) The 2019 total excludes amounts included in accounts payable as of December 31, 2018. Capital expenditure plans are revised periodically to reflect changes in operational, market and regulatory conditions. For the years presented, this table includes PPL Electric's asset optimization program to replace aging transmission and distribution assets. In addition to cash on hand and cash from operations, the Registrants plan to fund capital expenditures in 2019 with proceeds from the sources noted below.

Contractual Obligations The Registrants have assumed various financial obligations and commitments in the ordinary course of conducting business. At December 31, 2018 , estimated contractual cash obligations were as follows: 82 Table of Contents Total 2019 2020 - 2021 2022 - 2023 After 2023 PPL Long-term Debt (a) $ 20,694 $ 530 $ 2,514 $ 3,507 $ 14,143 Interest on Long-term Debt (b) 14,941 886 1,680 1,474 10,901 Operating Leases (c) 116 26 36 21 33 Purchase Obligations (d) 3,134 1,165 1,061 406 502 Pension Benefit Plan Funding Obligations (e) 784 265 353 166 Total Contractual Cash Obligations $ 39,669 $ 2,872 $ 5,644 $ 5,574 $ 25,579 PPL Electric Long-term Debt (a) $ 3,739 $ $ 500 $ 564 $ 2,675 Interest on Long-term Debt (b) 3,243 158 310 271 2,504 Unconditional Power Purchase Obligations 53 22 31 Total Contractual Cash Obligations $ 7,035 $ 180 $ 841 $ 835 $ 5,179 LKE Long-term Debt (a) $ 5,541 $ 530 $ 1,323 $ 13 $ 3,675 Interest on Long-term Debt (b) 3,023 212 369 307 2,135 Operating Leases (c) 70 20 26 13 11 Coal and Natural Gas Purchase Obligations (f) 1,733 614 811 283 25 Unconditional Power Purchase Obligations (g) 564 27 53 54 430 Construction Obligations (h) 385 291 81 13 Pension Benefit Plan Obligations (e) 20 20 Other Obligations 328 140 85 56 47 Total Contractual Cash Obligations $ 11,664 $ 1,854 $ 2,748 $ 739 $ 6,323 LG&E Long-term Debt (a) $ 1,824 $ 434 $ 98 $ $ 1,292 Interest on Long-term Debt (b) 1,136 66 114 108 848 Operating Leases (c) 30 10 10 6 4 Coal and Natural Gas Purchase Obligations (f) 942 303 442 177 20 Unconditional Power Purchase Obligations (g) 391 19 37 38 297 Construction Obligations (h) 143 123 17 3 Other Obligations 112 42 29 25 16 Total Contractual Cash Obligations $ 4,578 $ 997 $ 747 $ 357 $ 2,477 KU Long-term Debt (a) $ 2,342 $ 96 $ 500 $ 13 $ 1,733 Interest on Long-term Debt (b) 1,618 93 167 151 1,207 Operating Leases (c) 39 10 16 7 6 Coal and Natural Gas Purchase Obligations (f) 791 311 369 106 5 Unconditional Power Purchase Obligations (g) 173 8 16 16 133 Construction Obligations (h) 197 137 53 7 Other Obligations 135 43 38 23 31 Total Contractual Cash Obligations $ 5,295 $ 698 $ 1,159 $ 323 $ 3,115 (a) Reflects principal maturities based on stated maturity or earlier put dates. See Note 8 to the Financial Statements for a discussion of variable-rate remarketable bonds issued on behalf of LG&E and KU. The Registrants do not have any significant capital lease obligations. (b) Assumes interest payments through stated maturity or earlier put dates. For PPL, LKE, LG&E and KU the payments herein are subject to change, as payments for debt that is or becomes variable-rate debt have been estimated and for PPL, payments denominated in British pounds sterling have been translated to U.S. dollars at a current foreign currency exchange rate. (c) See Note 9 to the Financial Statements for additional information. (d) The amounts include agreements to purchase goods or services that are enforceable and legally binding and specify all significant terms, including: fixed or minimum quantities to be purchased; fixed, minimum or variable price provisions; and the approximate timing of the transaction. Primarily includes, as applicable, the purchase obligations of electricity, coal, natural gas and limestone, as well as certain construction expenditures, which are also included in the Capital Expenditures table presented above. (e) The amounts for PPL include WPD's contractual deficit pension funding requirements arising from actuarial valuations performed in March 2016. The U.K. electricity regulator currently allows a recovery of a substantial portion of the contributions relating to the plan deficit. The amounts also include contributions made or committed to be made in 2019 for PPL's and LKE's U.S. pension plans (for PPL Electric, LG&E and KU includes their share of these amounts). Based on the current funded status of these plans, except for WPD's plans, no cash contributions are required. See Note 11 to the Financial Statements for a discussion of expected contributions. 83 Table of Contents (f) Represents contracts to purchase coal, natural gas and natural gas transportation. See Note 13 to the Financial Statements for additional information. (g) Represents future minimum payments under OVEC power purchase agreements through June 2040. See Note 13 to the Financial Statements for additional information. (h) Represents construction commitments, including commitments for LG&E's and KU's Trimble County landfill construction, CCR Rule Closure and Process Water Program along with Cane Run plant demolition, which are also reflected in the Capital Expenditures table presented above. Dividends/Distributions (PPL) PPL views dividends as an integral component of shareowner return and expects to continue to pay dividends in amounts that are within the context of maintaining a capitalization structure that supports investment grade credit ratings. In November 2018 , PPL declared its quarterly common stock dividend, payable January 2, 2019 , at 41.0 cents per share (equivalent to $1.64 per annum). On February 14, 2019 , PPL announced that the company is increasing its common stock dividend to 41.25 cents per share on a quarterly basis (equivalent to $ 1.65 per annum). Future dividends will be declared at the discretion of the Board of Directors and will depend upon future earnings, cash flows, financial and legal requirements and other relevant factors. Subject to certain exceptions, PPL may not declare or pay any cash dividend or distribution on its capital stock during any period in which PPL Capital Funding defers interest payments on its 2007 Series A Junior Subordinated Notes due 2067 or 2013 Series B Junior Subordinated Notes due 2073 . At December 31, 2018 , no interest payments were deferred. (PPL Electric, LKE, LG&E and KU) From time to time, as determined by their respective Board of Directors, the Registrants pay dividends or distributions, as applicable, to their respective shareholders or members. Certain of the credit facilities of PPL Electric, LKE, LG&E and KU include minimum debt covenant ratios that could effectively restrict the payment of dividends or distributions. (All Registrants) See Note 8 to the Financial Statements for these and other restrictions related to distributions on capital interests for the Registrants and their subsidiaries. Purchase or Redemption of Debt Securities The Registrants will continue to evaluate outstanding debt securities and may decide to purchase or redeem these securities in open market or privately negotiated transactions, in exchange transactions or otherwise, depending upon prevailing market conditions, available cash and other factors, and may be commenced or suspended at any time. The amounts involved may be material. Rating Agency Actions Moody's and S&P periodically review the credit ratings of the debt of the Registrants and their subsidiaries. Based on their respective independent reviews, the rating agencies may make certain ratings revisions or ratings affirmations. A credit rating reflects an assessment by the rating agency of the creditworthiness associated with an issuer and particular securities that it issues. The credit ratings of the Registrants and their subsidiaries are based on information provided by the Registrants and other sources. The ratings of Moody's and S&P are not a recommendation to buy, sell or hold any securities of the Registrants or their subsidiaries. Such ratings may be subject to revisions or withdrawal by the agencies at any time and should be evaluated independently of each other and any other rating that may be assigned to the securities. The credit ratings of the Registrants and their subsidiaries affect their liquidity, access to capital markets and cost of borrowing under their credit facilities. A downgrade in the Registrants' or their subsidiaries' credit ratings could result in higher borrowing costs and reduced access to capital markets. The Registrants and their subsidiaries have no credit rating triggers that would result in the reduction of access to capital markets or the acceleration of maturity dates of outstanding debt. The following table sets forth the Registrants' and their subsidiaries' credit ratings for outstanding debt securities or commercial paper programs as of December 31, 2018 . 84 Table of Contents Senior Unsecured Senior Secured Commercial Paper Issuer Moody's S&P Moody's S&P Moody's S&P PPL PPL Capital Funding Baa2 BBB+ P-2 A-2 WPD plc Baa3 BBB+ WPD (East Midlands) Baa1 A- WPD (West Midlands) Baa1 A- WPD (South Wales) Baa1 A- WPD (South West) Baa1 A- PPL and PPL Electric PPL Electric A1 A P-2 A-2 PPL and LKE LKE Baa1 BBB+ LG&E A1 A P-2 A-2 KU A1 A P-2 A-2 The rating agencies have taken the following actions related to the Registrants and their subsidiaries. (PPL) In March 2018, Moody's and S&P assigned ratings of Baa1 and A- to WPD (South Wales)'s 30 million 0.01% Index-linked Senior Notes due 2036. In May 2018, Moody's and S&P assigned ratings of Baa1 and A- to WPD (West Midlands)'s 30 million 0.01% Index-linked Senior Notes due 2028. In October 2018, Moody's and S&P assigned ratings of Baa3 and BBB+ to WPD plc's 350 million 3.5% Senior Notes due 2026. (PPL and PPL Electric) In June 2018, Moody's and S&P assigned ratings of A1 and A to PPL Electric's $400 million 4.15% First Mortgage Bonds due 2048. (PPL, LKE and LG&E) In February 2018, Moody assigned a rating of A1 and S&P confirmed its rating of A to the County of Trimble, Kentucky's $28 million 2.30% Pollution Control Revenue Bonds, 2001 Series A (Louisville Gas and Electric Company Project) due 2026, previously issued on behalf of LG&E. In April 2018, Moody's assigned a rating of A1 and S&P confirmed its rating of A to the County of Trimble, Kentucky's $35 million 2.55% Pollution Control Revenue Bonds, 2001 Series B (Louisville Gas and Electric Company Project) due 2027, previously issued on behalf of LG&E. In April 2018, Moody's assigned a rating of A1 and S&P confirmed its rating of A to the County of Jefferson, Kentucky's $35 million 2.55% Pollution Control Revenue Bonds, 2001 Series B (Louisville Gas and Electric Company Project) due 2027, previously issued on behalf of LG&E. Ratings Triggers (PPL) As discussed in Note 8 to the Financial Statements, certain of WPD's senior unsecured notes may be put by the holders to the issuer for redemption if the long-term credit ratings assigned to the notes are withdrawn by any of the rating agencies (Moody's or S&P) or reduced to a non-investment grade rating of Ba1 or BB+ or lower in connection with a restructuring event. A restructuring event includes the loss of, or a material adverse change to, the distribution licenses under which WPD (East 85 Table of Contents Midlands), WPD (South West), WPD (South Wales) and WPD (West Midlands) operate and would be a trigger event for each company. These notes totaled 5.1 billion (approximately $6.5 billion) nominal value at December 31, 2018 . (PPL, LKE, LG&E and KU) Various derivative and non-derivative contracts, including contracts for the sale and purchase of electricity and fuel, commodity transportation and storage, interest rate and foreign currency instruments (for PPL), contain provisions that require the posting of additional collateral, or permit the counterparty to terminate the contract, if PPL's, LKE's, LG&E's or KU's or their subsidiaries' credit rating, as applicable, were to fall below investment grade. See Note 17 to the Financial Statements for a discussion of "Credit Risk-Related Contingent Features," including a discussion of the potential additional collateral requirements for PPL, LKE and LG&E for derivative contracts in a net liability position at December 31, 2018 . Guarantees for Subsidiaries (PPL) PPL guarantees certain consolidated affiliate financing arrangements. Some of the guarantees contain financial and other covenants that, if not met, would limit or restrict the consolidated affiliates' access to funds under these financing arrangements, accelerate maturity of such arrangements or limit the consolidated affiliates' ability to enter into certain transactions. At this time, PPL believes that these covenants will not limit access to relevant funding sources. See Note 13 to the Financial Statements for additional information about guarantees. Off-Balance Sheet Arrangements (All Registrants) The Registrants have entered into certain agreements that may contingently require payment to a guaranteed or indemnified party. See Note 13 to the Financial Statements for a discussion of these agreements. Risk Management Market Risk (All Registrants) See Notes 1 , 16 , and 17 to the Financial Statements for information about the Registrants' risk management objectives, valuation techniques and accounting designations. The forward-looking information presented below provides estimates of what may occur in the future, assuming certain adverse market conditions and model assumptions. Actual future results may differ materially from those presented. These are not precise indicators of expected future losses, but are rather only indicators of possible losses under normal market conditions at a given confidence level. Interest Rate Risk The Registrants and their subsidiaries issue debt to finance their operations, which exposes them to interest rate risk. The Registrants and their subsidiaries utilize various financial derivative instruments to adjust the mix of fixed and floating interest rates in their debt portfolios, adjust the duration of their debt portfolios and lock in benchmark interest rates in anticipation of future financing, when appropriate. Risk limits under the risk management program are designed to balance risk exposure to volatility in interest expense and changes in the fair value of the debt portfolios due to changes in the absolute level of interest rates. In addition, the interest rate risk of certain subsidiaries is potentially mitigated as a result of the existing regulatory framework or the timing of rate cases. The following interest rate hedges were outstanding at December 31. 86 Table of Contents 2018 2017 Exposure Hedged Fair Value, Net - Asset (Liability) (a) Effect of a 10% Adverse Movement in Rates (b) Maturities Ranging Through Exposure Hedged Fair Value, Net - Asset (Liability) (a) Effect of a 10% Adverse Movement in Rates (b) PPL Cash flow hedges Cross-currency swaps (c) $ 702 $ 137 $ (76 ) 2028 $ 702 $ 103 $ (84 ) Economic hedges Interest rate swaps (d) 147 (20 ) (1 ) 2033 147 (27 ) (1 ) LKE Economic hedges Interest rate swaps (d) 147 (20 ) (1 ) 2033 147 (27 ) (1 ) LG&E Economic hedges Interest rate swaps (d) 147 (20 ) (1 ) 2033 147 (27 ) (1 ) (a) Includes accrued interest, if applicable. (b) Effects of adverse movements decrease assets or increase liabilities, as applicable, which could result in an asset becoming a liability. Sensitivities represent a 10% adverse movement in interest rates, except for cross-currency swaps which also includes a 10% adverse movement in foreign currency exchange rates. (c) Changes in the fair value of these instruments are recorded in equity and reclassified into earnings in the same period during which the item being hedged affects earnings. (d) Realized changes in the fair value of such economic hedges are recoverable through regulated rates and any subsequent changes in the fair value of these derivatives are included in regulatory assets or regulatory liabilities. The Registrants are exposed to a potential increase in interest expense and to changes in the fair value of their debt portfolios. The estimated impact of a 10% adverse movement in interest rates on interest expense at December 31, 2018 and 2017 was insignificant for PPL, PPL Electric, LKE, LG&E and KU. The estimated impact of a 10% adverse movement in interest rates on the fair value of debt at December 31 is shown below. 10% Adverse Movement in Rates 2018 2017 PPL $ 652 $ 620 PPL Electric 188 162 LKE 172 168 LG&E 62 62 KU 92 92 Foreign Currency Risk (PPL) PPL is exposed to foreign currency risk primarily through investments in and earnings of U.K. affiliates. Under its risk management program, PPL may enter into financial instruments to hedge certain foreign currency exposures, including translation risk of expected earnings, firm commitments, recognized assets or liabilities, anticipated transactions and net investments. The following foreign currency hedges were outstanding at December 31. 2018 2017 Exposure Hedged Fair Value, Net - Asset (Liability) Effect of a 10% Adverse Movement in Foreign Currency Exchange Rates (a) Maturities Ranging Through Exposure Hedged Fair Value, Net - Asset (Liability) Effect of a 10% Adverse Movement in Foreign Currency Exchange Rates (a) Economic hedges (b) 1,540 $ 201 $ (181 ) 2020 2,563 $ 15 $ (323 ) (a) Effects of adverse movements decrease assets or increase liabilities, as applicable, which could result in an asset becoming a liability. (b) To economically hedge the translation of expected earnings denominated in GBP. 87 Table of Contents (All Registrants) Commodity Price Risk PPL is exposed to commodity price risk through its domestic subsidiaries as described below. PPL Electric is required to purchase electricity to fulfill its obligation as a PLR. Potential commodity price risk is insignificant and mitigated through its PUC-approved cost recovery mechanism and full-requirement supply agreements to serve its PLR customers which transfer the risk to energy suppliers. LG&E's and KU's rates include certain mechanisms for fuel, fuel-related expenses and energy purchases. In addition, LG&E's rates include a mechanism for natural gas supply expenses. These mechanisms generally provide for timely recovery of market price fluctuations associated with these expenses. Volumetric Risk PPL is exposed to volumetric risk through its subsidiaries as described below. WPD is exposed to volumetric risk which is significantly mitigated as a result of the method of regulation in the U.K. Under the RIIO-ED1 price control regulations, recovery of such exposure occurs on a two year lag. See Note 1 to the Financial Statements for additional information on revenue recognition under RIIO-ED1. PPL Electric, LG&E and KU are exposed to volumetric risk on retail sales, mainly due to weather and other economic conditions for which there is limited mitigation between rate cases. Defined Benefit Plans - Equity Securities Price Risk See "Application of Critical Accounting Policies - Defined Benefits" for additional information regarding the effect of equity securities price risk on plan assets. Credit Risk (All Registrants) Credit risk is the risk that the Registrants would incur a loss as a result of nonperformance by counterparties of their contractual obligations. The Registrants maintain credit policies and procedures with respect to counterparty credit (including requirements that counterparties maintain specified credit ratings) and require other assurances in the form of credit support or collateral in certain circumstances in order to limit counterparty credit risk. However, the Registrants, as applicable, have concentrations of suppliers and customers among electric utilities, financial institutions and energy marketing and trading companies. These concentrations may impact the Registrants' overall exposure to credit risk, positively or negatively, as counterparties may be similarly affected by changes in economic, regulatory or other conditions. (PPL and PPL Electric) In January 2017, the PUC issued a Final Order approving PPL Electric's PLR procurement plan for the period June 2017 through May 2021, which includes a total of eight solicitations for electricity supply semi-annually in April and October. To date, PPL Electric has conducted four of its planned eight competitive solicitations. Under the standard Supply Master Agreement (the Agreement) for the competitive solicitation process, PPL Electric requires all suppliers to post collateral if their credit exposure exceeds an established credit limit. In the event a supplier defaults on its obligation, PPL Electric would be required to seek replacement power in the market. All incremental costs incurred by PPL Electric would be recoverable from customers in future rates. At December 31, 2018, most of the successful bidders under all of the solicitations had an investment grade credit rating from S&P, and were not required to post collateral under the Agreement. A small portion of bidders were required to post an insignificant amount of collateral under the Agreement. There is no instance under the Agreement in which PPL Electric is required to post collateral to its suppliers. See Note 17 to the Financial Statements for additional information on credit risk. 88 Table of Contents Foreign Currency Translation (PPL) The value of the British pound sterling fluctuates in relation to the U.S. dollar. In 2018, changes in this exchange rate resulted in a foreign currency translation loss of $453 million, which primarily reflected a $754 million decrease to PP&E and $150 million decrease to goodwill partially offset by a $445 million decrease to long-term debt and a $6 million decrease to other net liabilities. In 2017, changes in this exchange rate resulted in a foreign currency translation gain of $537 million, which primarily reflected a $935 million increase to PP&E and $198 million increase to goodwill partially offset by a $549 million increase to long-term debt and an increase of $47 million to other net liabilities. In 2016, changes in this exchange rate resulted in a foreign currency translation loss of $1.1 billion, which primarily reflected a $2.1 billion decrease to PP&E and $490 million decrease to goodwill partially offset by a $1.3 billion decrease to long-term debt and a decrease of $208 million to other net liabilities. (All Registrants) Related Party Transactions The Registrants are not aware of any material ownership interests or operating responsibility by senior management in outside partnerships, including leasing transactions with variable interest entities, or other entities doing business with the Registrants. See Note 14 to the Financial Statements for additional information on related party transactions for PPL Electric, LKE, LG&E and KU. Acquisitions, Development and Divestitures The Registrants from time to time evaluate opportunities for potential acquisitions, divestitures and development projects. Development projects are reexamined based on market conditions and other factors to determine whether to proceed with, modify or terminate the projects. Any resulting transactions may impact future financial results. Capacity Needs (PPL, LKE, LG&E and KU) As a result of environmental requirements and energy efficiency measures, KU anticipates retiring two older coal-fired electricity generating units at the E.W. Brown plant in 2019 with a combined summer rating capacity of 272 MW. (All Registrants) Environmental Matters Extensive federal, state and local environmental laws and regulations are applicable to PPL's, PPL Electric's, LKE's, LG&E's and KU's air emissions, water discharges and the management of hazardous and solid waste, as well as other aspects of the Registrants' businesses. The cost of compliance or alleged non-compliance cannot be predicted with certainty but could be significant. In addition, costs may increase significantly if the requirements or scope of environmental laws or regulations, or similar rules, are expanded or changed. Costs may take the form of increased capital expenditures or operating and maintenance expenses, monetary fines, penalties or other restrictions. Many of these environmental law considerations are also applicable to the operations of key suppliers, or customers, such as coal producers and industrial power users, and may impact the cost for their products or their demand for the Registrants' services. Increased capital and operating costs are subject to rate recovery. PPL, PPL Electric, LKE, LG&E and KU can provide no assurances as to the ultimate outcome of future environmental or rate proceedings before regulatory authorities. See below for further discussion of the EPA's CCR Rule and Note 13 to the Financial Statements for a discussion of the more significant environmental matters including: Legal Matters, NAAQS, Climate Change and ELGs. See "Financial Condition - Liquidity and Capital Resources - Forecasted Uses of Cash - Capital Expenditures" in "Item 7. Combined Management's Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations" for information on projected environmental capital expenditures for 2019 through 2023 . See Note 19 to the Financial Statements for information related to the impacts of CCRs on AROs. EPA's CCR Rule (PPL, LKE, LG&E and KU) Over the next several years, LG&E and KU anticipate undertaking extensive measures, including significant capital expenditures, in complying with the provisions of the EPA's CCR Rule. Although LG&E and KU have identified compliance strategies and are finalizing closure plans and schedules as required by the CCR Rule, remaining regulatory uncertainties could 89 Table of Contents substantially impact current plans. As a result of a judicial settlement, legislative amendments, and the EPA's review of the current program, the EPA is in the process of undertaking significant revisions to the CCR Rule. On July 30, 2018, the EPA published certain amendments to the CCR Rule which include extending the deadline for commencement of closure of certain impoundments from April 2019 to October 31, 2020. The EPA has announced that additional amendments to the rule will be proposed. On August 21, 2018, the D.C. Circuit Court of Appeals vacated and remanded portions of the CCR Rule, including the provisions allowing unlined impoundments to continue operating and provisions exempting certain inactive impoundments from regulation. The exact impact of the judicial decision will be highly dependent on the EPA's rulemaking actions on remand and any subsequent legal challenges. LG&E and KU are evaluating the specific plan impacts of developments to date and will continue to monitor the EPA's ongoing regulatory proceedings. In connection with the CCR Rule, LG&E and KU have recorded adjustments to existing AROs beginning in 2015 and continue to record adjustments as required. See Note 19 to the Financial Statements for additional information on AROs. LG&E and KU continue to perform technical evaluations related to their plans to close impoundments at all of their generating plants. Although LG&E and KU believe their recorded liabilities appropriately reflect their obligations under current rules, changes to current compliance strategies as a result of ongoing regulatory proceedings or other developments could result in additional closure costs. It is not currently possible to determine the magnitude of any potential cost increases related to changes in compliance strategies or plans, and the timing of future cash outflows are indeterminable at this time. As rules are revised, technical evaluations are completed, and the timing and details of impoundment closures develop further on a plant by-plant basis, LG&E and KU will updated their cost estimates and record any changes as necessary to their ARO liability, which could be material. These costs are subject to rate recovery. 90 Table of Contents Sustainability Increasing attention has been focused on a broad range of corporate activities under the heading of sustainability , which has resulted in a significant increase in the number of requests from interested parties for information on sustainability topics. These parties range from investor groups focused on environmental, social, governance and other matters to non-investors concerned with a variety of public policy matters. Often the scope of the information sought is very broad and not necessarily relevant to an issuer business or industry. As a result, a number of private groups have proposed to standardize the subject matter constituting sustainability, either generally or by industry. Those efforts remain ongoing. In addition, certain of these private groups have advocated that the SEC promulgate regulations requiring specific sustainability reporting under the Securities Exchange Act of 1934, as amended (the 34 Act ), or that issuers voluntarily include certain sustainability disclosure in their 34 Act reports. To date, no new reporting requirements have been adopted or proposed by the SEC. As has been PPL practice, to the extent sustainability issues have or may have a material impact on the Registrants financial condition or results of operation, PPL discloses such matters in accordance with applicable securities law and SEC regulations. With respect to other sustainability topics that PPL deems relevant to investors but that are not required to be reported under applicable securities law and SEC regulation, PPL will continue each spring to publish its annual sustainability report and post that report on its corporate website at www.pplweb.com and on www.pplsustainability.com. Neither the information in such annual sustainability report nor the information at such websites is incorporated in this Form 10-K by reference, and it should not be considered a part of this Form 10-K. In preparing its sustainability report, PPL is guided by the framework established by the Global Reporting Initiative, which identifies environmental, social, governance and other subject matter categories. PPL also participates in efforts by the Edison Electric Institute to provide the appropriate subset of sustainability information that can be applied consistently across the electric utility industry and responds to the CDP climate survey.

Competition See "Competition" under each of PPL's reportable segments in "Item 1. Business - General - Segment Information" and "Item 1A. Risk Factors" for a discussion of competitive factors affecting the Registrants. New Accounting Guidance See Note 1 and 21 to the Financial Statements for a discussion of new accounting guidance adopted and pending adoption. Application of Critical Accounting Policies Financial condition and results of operations are impacted by the methods, assumptions and estimates used in the application of critical accounting policies. The following accounting policies are particularly important to an understanding of the reported financial condition or results of operations and require management to make estimates or other judgments of matters that are inherently uncertain. Changes in the estimates or other judgments included within these accounting policies could result in a significant change to the information presented in the Financial Statements (these accounting policies are also discussed in Note 1 to the Financial Statements). Senior management has reviewed with PPL's Audit Committee these critical accounting policies, the following disclosures regarding their application, and the estimates and assumptions regarding them. Defined Benefits (All Registrants) Certain of the Registrants and/or their subsidiaries sponsor or participate in, as applicable, certain qualified funded and non-qualified unfunded defined benefit pension plans and both funded and unfunded other postretirement benefit plans. These plans are applicable to certain of the Registrants' employees (based on eligibility for their applicable plans). The Registrants and certain of their subsidiaries record an asset or liability to recognize the funded status of all defined benefit plans with an offsetting entry to AOCI or, in the case of PPL Electric, LG&E and KU, regulatory assets and liabilities for amounts that are expected to be recovered through regulated customer rates. Consequently, the funded status of all defined benefit plans is fully 91 Table of Contents recognized on the Balance Sheets. See Notes 7 and 11 to the Financial Statements for additional information about the plans and the accounting for defined benefits. A summary of plan sponsors by Registrant and whether a Registrant or its subsidiaries sponsor (S) or participate in and receives allocations (P) from those plans is shown in the table below. Plan Sponsor PPL PPL Electric LKE LG&E KU PPL Services S P WPD (a) S LKE S P P LG&E S (a) Does not sponsor or participate in other postretirement benefits plans. Management makes certain assumptions regarding the valuation of benefit obligations and the performance of plan assets. As such, annual net periodic defined benefit costs are recorded in current earnings or regulatory assets and liabilities based on estimated results. Any differences between actual and estimated results are recorded in AOCI, or in the case of PPL Electric, LG&E and KU, regulatory assets and liabilities for amounts that are expected to be recovered through regulated customer rates. These amounts in AOCI or regulatory assets and liabilities are amortized to income over future periods. The delayed recognition allows for a smoothed recognition of costs over the working lives of the employees who benefit under the plans. The significant assumptions are: Discount Rate - The discount rate is used in calculating the present value of benefits, which is based on projections of benefit payments to be made in the future. The objective in selecting the discount rate is to measure the single amount that, if invested at the measurement date in a portfolio of high-quality debt instruments, would provide the necessary future cash flows to pay the accumulated benefits when due. Expected Return on Plan Assets - Management projects the long-term rates of return on plan assets that will be earned over the life of the plan. These projected returns reduce the net benefit costs the Registrants record currently. Rate of Compensation Increase - Management projects employees' annual pay increases, which are used to project employees' pension benefits at retirement. (PPL) In selecting the discount rate for its U.K. pension plans, WPD starts with a cash flow analysis of the expected benefit payment stream for its plans. These plan-specific cash flows are matched against a spot-rate yield curve to determine the assumed discount rate. The spot-rate yield curve uses an iBoxx British pounds sterling denominated corporate bond index as its base. From this base, those bonds with the lowest and highest yields are eliminated to develop an appropriate subset of bonds. Historically, WPD used the single weighted-average discount rate derived from the spot rates used to discount the benefit obligation. Concurrent with the annual remeasurement of plan assets and obligations at December 31, 2015, WPD began using individual spot rates to measure service cost and interest cost beginning with the calculation of 2016 net periodic defined benefit cost. An individual bond matching approach, which is used for the U.S. pension plans as discussed below, is not used for the U.K. pension plans because the universe of bonds in the U.K. is not deep enough to adequately support such an approach. (All Registrants) In selecting the discount rates for U.S. defined benefit plans, the plan sponsors start with a cash flow analysis of the expected benefit payment stream for their plans. The plan-specific cash flows are matched against the coupons and expected maturity values of individually selected bonds. This bond matching process begins with the full universe of Aa-rated non-callable (or callable with make-whole provisions) bonds, serving as the base from which those with the lowest and highest yields are eliminated to develop an appropriate subset of bonds. Individual bonds are then selected based on the timing of each plan's cash flows and parameters are established as to the percentage of each individual bond issue that could be hypothetically purchased and the surplus reinvestment rates to be assumed. 92 Table of Contents To determine the expected return on plan assets, plan sponsors project the long-term rates of return on plan assets using a best-estimate of expected returns, volatilities and correlations for each asset class. Each plan's specific current and expected asset allocations are also considered in developing a reasonable return assumption. In selecting a rate of compensation increase, plan sponsors consider past experience in light of movements in inflation rates. The following table provides the weighted-average assumptions selected for discount rate, expected return on plan assets and rate of compensation increase at December 31 used to measure current year obligations and subsequent year net periodic defined benefit costs under GAAP, as applicable. Assumption / Registrant 2018 2017 Discount rate Pension - PPL (U.S.) 4.35 % 3.70 % Pension - PPL (U.K.) Obligations 2.98 % 2.65 % Pension - PPL (U.K.) Service Cost (a) 3.12 % 2.73 % Pension - PPL (U.K.) Interest Cost (a) 2.62 % 2.31 % Pension - LKE 4.35 % 3.69 % Pension - LG&E 4.33 % 3.65 % Other Postretirement - PPL 4.31 % 3.64 % Other Postretirement - LKE 4.32 % 3.65 % Expected return on plan assets Pension - PPL (U.S.) 7.25 % 7.25 % Pension - PPL (U.K.) 7.21 % 7.23 % Pension - LKE 7.25 % 7.25 % Pension - LG&E 7.25 % 7.25 % Other Postretirement - PPL 6.46 % 6.40 % Other Postretirement - LKE 7.00 % 7.15 % Rate of compensation increase Pension - PPL (U.S.) 3.79 % 3.78 % Pension - PPL (U.K.) 3.50 % 3.50 % Pension - LKE 3.50 % 3.50 % Other Postretirement - PPL 3.76 % 3.75 % Other Postretirement - LKE 3.50 % 3.50 % (a) WPD uses individual spot rates from the yield curve used to discount the benefit obligation to measure service cost and interest cost for the calculation of net periodic defined benefit cost. PPL's U.S. plans use a single discount rate derived from an individual bond matching model to measure the benefit obligation, service cost and interest cost. See Note 1 to the Financial Statements for additional details. A variance in the assumptions listed above could have a significant impact on accrued defined benefit liabilities or assets, reported annual net periodic defined benefit costs and AOCI or regulatory assets and liabilities. At December 31, 2018 , the defined benefit plans were recorded in the Registrants' financial statements as follows. PPL PPL Electric LKE LG&E KU Balance Sheet: Regulatory assets (a) $ 963 $ 558 $ 405 $ 249 $ 156 Regulatory liabilities 37 5 32 32 Pension assets 535 Pension liabilities 783 285 286 11 1 Other postretirement and postemployment benefit liabilities 239 120 100 69 31 AOCI (pre-tax) 3,209 121 Statement of Income: Defined benefits expense $ (184 ) $ 3 $ 24 $ 6 $ 3 Increase (decrease) from prior year (97 ) (9 ) (9 ) (5 ) (2 ) (a) As a result of the 2014 Kentucky rate case settlement that became effective July 1, 2015, the difference between pension cost calculated in accordance with LG&E's and KU's pension accounting policy and pension cost calculated using a 15 year amortization period for actuarial gains and losses is 93 Table of Contents recorded as a regulatory asset. At December 31, 2018 , the balances were $45 million for PPL and LKE, $25 million for LG&E and $20 million for KU. See Note 7 to the Financial Statements for additional information. The following tables reflect changes in certain assumptions based on the Registrants' primary defined benefit plans. The tables reflect either an increase or decrease in each assumption. The inverse of this change would impact the accrued defined benefit liabilities or assets, reported annual net periodic defined benefit costs and AOCI or regulatory assets and liabilities by a similar amount in the opposite direction. The sensitivities below reflect an evaluation of the change based solely on a change in that assumption.

Included in those provisional amounts were estimates of: tax depreciation, deductible executive compensation, accumulated foreign earnings, foreign tax credits, and deemed dividends from foreign subsidiaries, all of which were based on the interpretation and application of various provisions of the TCJA. In the third quarter of 2018, PPL filed its consolidated federal income tax return, which was prepared using guidance issued by the U.S. Treasury Department and the IRS since the filing of each Registrant's 2017 Form 10-K. Accordingly, the Registrants have updated the following provisional amounts and now consider them to be complete: (1) the amount of the deemed dividend and associated foreign tax credits relating to the transition tax imposed on accumulated foreign earnings as of December 31, 2017; (2) the amount of accelerated 100% "bonus" depreciation PPL was eligible to claim in its 2017 federal income tax return; and (3) the related impacts on PPL's 2017 consolidated federal net operating loss to be carried forward to future periods. In addition, the Registrants recorded the tax impact of the U.S. federal corporate income tax rate reduction from 35% to 21% on 94 Table of Contents the changes to deferred tax assets and liabilities resulting from the completed provisional amounts. The completed provisional amounts related to the tax rate reduction had an insignificant impact on the net regulatory liabilities of PPL's U.S. regulated operations. In the fourth quarter of 2018, PPL completed its analysis of the deductibility of executive compensation awarded as of November 2, 2017 and concluded that no material change to the provisional amounts is required. The Registrants' accounting related to the effects of the TCJA on financial results for the period ended December 31, 2017 is complete as of December 31, 2018 with respect to all provisional amounts. In 2018, the IRS issued proposed regulations for certain provisions of the TCJA, including interest deductibility, Base Erosion Anti-Avoidance Tax (BEAT), and Global Intangible Low-Taxed Income (GILTI). PPL has determined that the proposed regulations related to BEAT and GILTI do not materially change PPL's current interpretation of the statutory impact of these rules on the company. Proposed regulations relating to the limitation on the deductibility of interest expense were issued in November 2018 and such regulations provide detailed rules implementing the broader statutory provisions. These proposed regulations should not apply to the Registrants until the year in which the regulations are issued in final form, which is expected to be 2019. It is uncertain what form the final regulations will take and, therefore, the Registrants cannot predict what impact the final regulations will have on the tax deductibility of interest expense. However, if the proposed regulations were issued as final in their current form, the Registrants could have a limitation on a portion of their interest expense deduction for tax purposes and such limitation could be significant. Significant management judgment is also required in developing the Registrants' provision for income taxes, primarily due to the uncertainty related to tax positions taken or expected to be taken in tax returns, valuation allowances on deferred tax assets and whether the undistributed earnings of WPD are considered indefinitely reinvested. Additionally, significant management judgment is required to determine the amount of benefit recognized related to an uncertain tax position. Tax positions are evaluated following a two-step process. The first step requires an entity to determine whether, based on the technical merits supporting a particular tax position, it is more likely than not (greater than a 50% chance) that the tax position will be sustained. This determination assumes that the relevant taxing authority will examine the tax position and is aware of all the relevant facts surrounding the tax position. The second step requires an entity to recognize in the financial statements the benefit of a tax position that meets the more-likely-than-not recognition criterion. The benefit recognized is measured at the largest amount of benefit that has a likelihood of realization, upon settlement, that exceeds 50%. Management considers a number of factors in assessing the benefit to be recognized, including negotiation of a settlement. On a quarterly basis, uncertain tax positions are reassessed by considering information known as of the reporting date. Based on management's assessment of new information, a tax benefit may subsequently be recognized for a previously unrecognized tax position, a previously recognized tax position may be derecognized, or the benefit of a previously recognized tax position may be remeasured. The amounts ultimately paid upon resolution of issues raised by taxing authorities may differ materially from the amounts accrued and may materially impact the financial statements in the future. Unrecognized tax benefits are classified as current to the extent management expects to settle an uncertain tax position by payment or receipt of cash within one year of the reporting date. At December 31, 2018 , no significant changes in unrecognized tax benefits are projected over the next 12 months. The need for valuation allowances to reduce deferred tax assets also requires significant management judgment. Valuation allowances are initially recorded and reevaluated each reporting period by assessing the likelihood of the ultimate realization of a deferred tax asset. Management considers a number of factors in assessing the realization of a deferred tax asset, including the reversal of temporary differences, future taxable income and ongoing prudent and feasible tax planning strategies. Any tax planning strategy utilized in this assessment must meet the recognition and measurement criteria utilized to account for an uncertain tax position. Management also considers the uncertainty posed by political risk and the effect of this uncertainty on the various factors that management takes into account in evaluating the need for valuation allowances. The amount of deferred tax assets ultimately realized may differ materially from the estimates utilized in the computation of valuation allowances and may materially impact the financial statements in the future. See Note 6 to the Financial Statements for income tax disclosures, including the impact of the TCJA and management's conclusion that the undistributed earnings of WPD are considered indefinitely reinvested. Based on this conclusion, PPL Global does not record deferred U.S. federal income taxes on WPD's undistributed earnings. 95 Table of Contents Regulatory Assets and Liabilities (All Registrants) PPL Electric, LG&E and KU, are subject to cost-based rate regulation. As a result, the effects of regulatory actions are required to be reflected in the financial statements. Assets and liabilities are recorded that result from the regulated ratemaking process that may not be recorded under GAAP for non-regulated entities. Regulatory assets generally represent incurred costs that have been deferred because such costs are probable of future recovery in regulated customer rates. Regulatory liabilities are recognized for amounts expected to be returned through future regulated customer rates. In certain cases, regulatory liabilities are recorded based on an understanding or agreement with the regulator that rates have been set to recover costs that are expected to be incurred in the future, and the regulated entity is accountable for any amounts charged pursuant to such rates and not yet expended for the intended purpose. Management continually assesses whether the regulatory assets are probable of future recovery by considering factors such as changes in the applicable regulatory and political environments, the ability to recover costs through regulated rates, recent rate orders to the Registrants and other regulated entities, and the status of any pending or potential deregulation legislation. Based on this continual assessment, management believes the existing regulatory assets are probable of recovery. This assessment reflects the current political and regulatory climate at the state and federal levels, and is subject to change in the future. If future recovery of costs ceases to be probable, the regulatory asset would be written-off. Additionally, the regulatory agencies can provide flexibility in the manner and timing of recovery of regulatory assets. See Note 7 to the Financial Statements for regulatory assets and regulatory liabilities recorded at December 31, 2018 and 2017 , as well as additional information on those regulatory assets and liabilities. All regulatory assets are either currently being recovered under specific rate orders, represent amounts that are expected to be recovered in future rates or benefit future periods based upon established regulatory practices. (PPL) WPD operates in an incentive-based regulatory structure under distribution licenses granted by Ofgem. As the regulatory model is incentive-based rather than a cost recovery model, WPD is not subject to accounting for the effects of certain types of regulation as prescribed by GAAP for entities subject to cost-based rate regulation and does not record regulatory assets and liabilities. Therefore, the accounting treatment of adjustments to base revenue and/or allowed revenue is evaluated based on revenue recognition guidance. See Note 1 to the Financial Statements for additional information. Price Risk Management (PPL) See "Financial Condition - Risk Management" above, as well as "Price Risk Management" in Note 1 to the Financial Statements. Goodwill Impairment (PPL, LKE, LG&E and KU) Goodwill is tested for impairment at the reporting unit level. PPL has determined its reporting units to be primarily at the same level as its reportable segments. LKE, LG&E and KU are individually single operating and reportable segments. A goodwill impairment test is performed annually or more frequently if events or changes in circumstances indicate that the carrying amount of the reporting unit may be greater than the reporting unit's fair value. Additionally, goodwill is tested for impairment after a portion of goodwill has been allocated to a business to be disposed of. PPL, LKE, LG&E and KU may elect either to initially make a qualitative evaluation about the likelihood of an impairment of goodwill or to bypass the qualitative evaluation and test goodwill for impairment using a two-step quantitative test. If the qualitative evaluation (referred to as "step zero") is elected and the assessment results in a determination that it is not more likely than not that the fair value of a reporting unit is less than the carrying amount, the two-step quantitative impairment test is not necessary. When the two-step quantitative impairment test is elected or required as a result of the step zero assessment, in step one, PPL, LKE, LG&E and KU determine whether a potential impairment exists by comparing the estimated fair value of the reporting unit with its carrying amount, including goodwill, on the measurement date. If the estimated fair value exceeds its carrying amount, goodwill is not considered impaired. If the carrying amount exceeds the estimated fair value, the second step is performed to measure the amount of impairment loss, if any. 96 Table of Contents The second step of the quantitative test requires a calculation of the implied fair value of goodwill, which is determined in the same manner as the amount of goodwill in a business combination. That is, the estimated fair value of a reporting unit is allocated to all of the assets and liabilities of that reporting unit as if the reporting unit had been acquired in a business combination and the estimated fair value of the reporting unit was the price paid to acquire the reporting unit. The excess of the estimated fair value of a reporting unit over the amounts assigned to its assets and liabilities is the implied fair value of goodwill. The implied fair value of the reporting unit's goodwill is then compared with the carrying amount of that goodwill. If the carrying amount exceeds the implied fair value, an impairment loss is recognized in an amount equal to that excess. The loss recognized cannot exceed the carrying amount of the reporting unit's goodwill. PPL, LKE, LG&E and KU elected to perform the two-step quantitative impairment test of goodwill for all reporting units in the fourth quarter of 2018. Management used both discounted cash flows and market multiples, which required significant assumptions, to estimate the fair value of the reporting units. Significant assumptions used in the discounted cash flows include discount and growth rates, outcomes of future rate filings, and projected operating and capital cash flows. Projected operating and capital cash flows is based on the Registrants' internal business plan, which assumes the occurrence of certain events in the future. Significant assumptions used in the market multiples include utility sector market performance and comparable transactions. PPL's goodwill was $ 3.2 billion at December 31, 2018 , which primarily consists of $ 2.4 billion related to the acquisition of WPD and $662 million related to the acquisition of LKE. The goodwill balances of LKE, LG&E and KU at December 31, 2018 were $996 million, $389 million and $607 million. Applying an appropriate weighting to both the discounted cash flow and market multiple valuations for the most recent impairment tests performed as of October 1, 2018 did not require the second-step assessment and did not result in any impairment. A high degree of judgment is required in developing estimates related to fair value conclusions. A decrease in the forecasted cash flows of 10%, an increase in the discount rate by 0.25%, or a 10% decrease in the market multiples would not have resulted in an impairment of goodwill for these reporting units. Asset Retirement Obligations (PPL, LKE, LG&E and KU) ARO liabilities are required to be recognized for legal obligations associated with the retirement of long-lived assets. The initial obligation is measured at its estimated fair value. An ARO must be recognized when incurred if the fair value of the ARO can be reasonably estimated. An equivalent amount is recorded as an increase in the value of the capitalized asset and amortized to expense over the useful life of the asset. For LKE, LG&E and KU, all ARO accretion and depreciation expenses are reclassified as a regulatory asset. ARO regulatory assets associated with certain CCR projects are amortized to expense in accordance with regulatory approvals. For other AROs, at the time of retirement, the related ARO regulatory asset is offset against the associated cost of removal regulatory liability, PP&E and ARO liability. See Note 7 and Note 19 to the Financial Statements for additional information on AROs. In determining AROs, management must make significant judgments and estimates to calculate fair value. Fair value is developed using an expected present value technique based on assumptions of market participants that consider estimated retirement costs in current period dollars that are inflated to the anticipated retirement date and then discounted back to the date the ARO was incurred. Changes in assumptions and estimates included within the calculations of the fair value of AROs could result in significantly different results than those identified and recorded in the financial statements. Estimated ARO costs and settlement dates, which affect the carrying value of the ARO and the related capitalized asset, are reviewed periodically to ensure that any material changes are incorporated into the latest estimate of the ARO. Any change to the capitalized asset, positive or negative, is generally amortized over the remaining life of the associated long-lived asset. 97 Table of Contents At December 31, 2018 , the total recorded balances and information on the most significant recorded AROs were as follows. Most Significant AROs Total ARO Recorded Amount Recorded % of Total Description PPL $ 347 $ 245 71 Ponds, landfills and natural gas mains LKE 296 245 83 Ponds, landfills and natural gas mains LG&E 103 81 79 Ponds, landfills and natural gas mains KU 193 164 85 Ponds and landfills The most significant assumptions surrounding AROs are the forecasted retirement costs (including the settlement dates and the timing of cash flows), the discount rates and the inflation rates. At December 31, 2018 , a 10% increase to retirement cost would increase these ARO liabilities by $33 million. A 0.25% decrease in the discount rate would increase these ARO liabilities by $4 million and a 0.25% increase in the inflation rate would increase these ARO liabilities by $3 million. There would be no significant change to the annual depreciation expense of the ARO asset or the annual accretion expense of the ARO liability as a result of these changes in assumptions. Revenue Recognition - Unbilled Revenues (LKE, LG&E and KU) Revenues related to the sale of energy are recorded when service is rendered or when energy is delivered to customers. Because customers are billed on cycles which vary based on the timing of the actual meter reads taken throughout the month, estimates are recorded for unbilled revenues at the end of each reporting period. For LG&E and KU, such unbilled revenue amounts reflect estimates of deliveries to customers since the date of the last reading of their meters. The unbilled revenue estimates reflect consideration of factors including daily load models, estimated usage for each customer class, the effect of current and different rate schedules, the meter read schedule, the billing schedule, actual weather data and where applicable, the impact of weather normalization or other regulatory provisions of rate structures. See "Unbilled revenues" on the Registrants' Balance Sheets for balances at December 31, 2018 and 2017 .
