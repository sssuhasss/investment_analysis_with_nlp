BASIS OF PRESENTATION The Consolidated Financial Statements have been prepared in accordance with generally accepted accounting principles ( GAAP ) in the United States of America ( U.S. ). These financial statements present the consolidated position of the Company and include the entities in which the Company directly or indirectly has a controlling financial interest as well as various entities in which the Company has investments recorded under either the cost or equity methods of accounting. Intercompany balances and transactions have been eliminated. Amounts presented may not sum due to rounding. In presenting the Consolidated Financial Statements, management makes estimates and assumptions that affect the amounts reported and related disclosures. Estimates, by their nature, are based on judgment and available information. Accordingly, actual results could differ from those estimates. In management opinion, the Consolidated Financial Statements contain all normal recurring adjustments necessary for a fair presentation of results reported. The results of operations reported for the periods presented are not necessarily indicative of the results of operations for subsequent periods. Effective in the first quarter of fiscal year 2016, we have revised our presentation in the Consolidated Statements of Earnings to separately present Operating expenses, Operating income, and Non-operating expenses, net. Previously, we reported Other expenses, net, as part of Total expenses and did not separately present Operating income in our Consolidated Statements of Earnings. All prior period information has been conformed to the current period presentation. See Note 4, Non-Operating Expenses, Net, to our Consolidated Financial Statements under Item 8 of Part II of this Annual Report on Form 10-K for details of the Company Non-operating expenses, net and Note 18, Quarterly Financial Results (Unaudited), to our Consolidated Financial Statements under Item 8 of Part II of this Annual Report on Form 10-K for details of the Company Operating income. CRITICAL ACCOUNTING POLICIES We continually evaluate the accounting policies and estimates used to prepare the Consolidated Financial Statements. The estimates, by their nature, are based on judgment, available information, and historical experience and are believed to be reasonable. However, actual amounts and results could differ from these estimates made by management. Certain accounting policies that require significant management estimates and are deemed critical to our results of operations or financial position are discussed below. Goodwill . We review the carrying value of all our goodwill by comparing the carrying value of our reporting units to their fair values. We are required to perform this comparison at least annually or more frequently if circumstances indicate a possible impairment. When determining fair value of a reporting unit, we utilize the income approach which considers future cash flows using various assumptions, including projections of revenues based on assumed long-term growth rates, estimated costs and appropriate discount rates based on the particular business weighted-average cost of capital. The principal factors used in the discounted cash flow analysis requiring judgment are the projected future operating cash flows, the weighted-average cost of capital and the terminal value growth rate assumptions. The weighted-average cost of capital takes into account the relative weight of each component of our consolidated capital structure (equity and long-term debt). Our estimates of long-term growth and costs are based on historical data, various internal estimates and a variety of external sources, and are developed as part of our routine, long-range planning process. Changes in economic and operating conditions impacting these assumptions could result in goodwill impairments in future periods. We had $999.3 million of goodwill as of June 30, 2016 . Given the significance of our goodwill, an adverse change to the fair value of one of our reporting units could result in an impairment charge, which could be material to our earnings. The Company performs a sensitivity analysis under Step 1 of the goodwill impairment test assuming hypothetical reductions in the fair values of our reporting units. A 10% change in our estimates of projected future operating cash flows, discount rates, or terminal value growth rates used in our calculations of the fair values of the reporting units would not result in an impairment of our goodwill. Income Taxes . The objectives of accounting for income taxes are to recognize the amount of taxes payable or refundable for the current year and deferred tax liabilities and assets for the future tax consequences of events that have been recognized in an entity financial statements or tax returns. Judgment is required in addressing the future tax consequences of events that have been recognized in our Consolidated Financial Statements or tax returns (e.g., realization of deferred tax assets, changes in tax laws or interpretations thereof). The Company is subject to regular examination of its income tax returns by the U.S. federal, state and foreign tax authorities. A change in the assessment of the outcomes of such matters could materially impact 27 our Consolidated Financial Statements. As of June 30, 2016 , we had estimated foreign net operating loss carryforwards of approximately $13.7 million , of which $1.2 million expires in 2017 through 2027 , and $12.5 million which has an indefinite utilization period. In addition, the Company has estimated U.S. federal net operating loss carryforwards of approximately $31.4 million , which expire in 2017 through 2030 . Valuation allowances are recognized to reduce deferred tax assets when it is more likely than not that the Company will not be able to utilize the deferred tax assets attributable to net operating and capital loss carryforwards of certain subsidiaries to offset future taxable earnings. The Company has recorded valuation allowances of $9.8 million and $9.2 million at June 30, 2016 and 2015 , respectively. The determination as to whether a deferred tax asset will be recognized is made on a jurisdictional basis and is based on the evaluation of historical taxable income or loss, projected future taxable income, carryforward periods, scheduled reversals of deferred tax liabilities and tax planning strategies. Projected future taxable income is based on expected results and assumptions as to the jurisdiction in which the income will be earned. The assumptions used to project future taxable income requires significant judgment and are consistent with the plans and estimates used to manage the underlying businesses. Share-based Payments . Accounting for stock-based compensation requires the measurement of stock-based compensation expense based on the fair value of the award on the date of grant. We determine the fair value of stock options issued by using a binomial option-pricing model. The binomial option-pricing model considers a range of assumptions related to volatility, dividend yield, risk-free interest rate and employee exercise behavior. Expected volatilities utilized in the binomial option-pricing model are based on a combination of implied market volatilities, historical volatility of our stock price and other factors. Similarly, the dividend yield is based on historical experience and expected future changes. The risk-free rate is derived from the U.S. Treasury yield curve in effect at the time of grant. The binomial option-pricing model also incorporates exercise and forfeiture assumptions based on an analysis of historical data. The expected life of the stock option grants is derived from the output of the binomial model and represents the period of time that options granted are expected to be outstanding. Determining these assumptions are subjective and complex, and therefore, a change in the assumptions utilized could impact the calculation of the fair value of our stock options. A hypothetical change of five percentage points applied to the volatility assumption used to determine the fair value of the fiscal year 2016 stock option grants would result in approximately a $1.5 million change in total pre-tax stock-based compensation expense for the fiscal year 2016 grants, which would be amortized over the vesting period. A hypothetical change of one year in the expected life assumption used to determine the fair value of the fiscal year 2016 stock option grants would result in approximately a $0.4 million change in the total pre-tax stock-based compensation expense for the fiscal year 2016 grants, which would be amortized over the vesting period. A hypothetical change of one percentage point in the forfeiture rate assumption used for the fiscal year 2016 stock option grants would result in approximately a $0.1 million change in the total pre-tax stock-based compensation expense for the fiscal year 2016 grants, which would be amortized over the vesting period. A hypothetical one-half percentage point change in the dividend yield assumption used to determine the fair value of the fiscal year 2016 stock option grants would result in approximately a $0.6 million change in the total pre-tax stock-based compensation expense for the fiscal year 2016 grants, which would be amortized over the vesting period. RESULTS OF OPERATIONS The following discussions of Analysis of Consolidated Statements of Earnings and Analysis of Reportable Segments refer to the fiscal year ended June 30, 2016 compared to the fiscal year ended June 30, 2015 , and the fiscal year ended June 30, 2015 compared to the fiscal year ended June 30, 2014 . The Analysis of Consolidated Statements of Earnings should be read in conjunction with the Analysis of Reportable Segments, which provides more detailed discussions concerning certain components of the Consolidated Statements of Earnings. The following references are utilized in the discussions of Analysis of Consolidated Statements of Earnings and Analysis of Reportable Segments: Acquisition Amortization and Other Costs represents amortization expenses associated with acquired intangible assets as well as certain integration and other transaction costs associated with the Company acquisition activities. Net New Business refers to recurring revenue from closed sales less recurring revenue from client losses. The following definitions describe the Company Revenues: Fee revenues in the Investor Communication Solutions segment are derived from both recurring and event-driven activity. In addition, the level of recurring and event-driven activity we process directly impacts distribution revenues. While event-driven activity is highly repeatable, it may not recur on an annual basis. The types of services we provide that comprise event-driven activity are: 28 Mutual Fund Proxy: The proxy and related services we provide to mutual funds when certain events occur requiring a shareholder vote including changes in directors, sub-advisors, fee structures, investment restrictions, and mergers of funds. Mutual Fund Communications: Mutual fund communications services consist primarily of the distribution on behalf of mutual funds of supplemental information required to be provided to the annual mutual fund prospectus as a result of certain triggering events such as a change in portfolio managers. In addition, mutual fund communications consist of notices and marketing materials such as newsletters. Proxy Contests and Specials, Corporate Actions, and Other: The proxy services we provide in connection with shareholder meetings driven by special events such as proxy contests, mergers and acquisitions, and tender/exchange offers. Event-driven fee revenues are based on the number of special events and corporate transactions we process. Event-driven activity is impacted by financial market conditions and changes in regulatory compliance requirements, resulting in fluctuations in the timing and levels of event-driven fee revenues. As such, the timing and level of event-driven activity and its potential impact on revenues and earnings are difficult to forecast. Generally, mutual fund proxy activity has been subject to a greater level of volatility than the other components of event-driven activity. During fiscal year 2016 , mutual fund proxy fee revenues were 22% higher than the prior fiscal year while during fiscal years 2015 and 2014 , mutual fund proxy revenues were 2% lower and 31% higher than the prior fiscal year, respectively. Although it is difficult to forecast the levels of event-driven activity, we expect that the portion of fee revenues derived from mutual fund proxy activity may continue to experience volatility in the future. Distribution revenues primarily include revenues related to the physical mailing of proxy materials, interim communications, transaction reporting, customer communications and fulfillment services as well as Matrix administrative services. Distribution cost of revenues consists primarily of postage-related expenses incurred in connection with our Investor Communication Solutions segment, as well as Matrix administrative services expenses. These costs are reflected in Cost of revenues. Closed sales represent the expected recurring annual revenue for new client contracts that were signed by Broadridge during the periods referenced. These types of sales were previously described by the Company as recurring revenue closed sales. Closed sales are a key indicator of Broadridge's expected future revenue growth. The amount of the closed sale is an estimate of annual revenues based on client volumes or activity, it excludes distribution revenues. The inherent variability of transaction volumes and activity levels can result in some variability of amounts reported as closed sales. Larger closed sales can take up to 12 to 24 months or longer to convert to revenues, particularly for the services provided by our Global Technology and Operations segment. The Company tracks actual revenues achieved during the first year that the client contract is fully implemented and compares this to the amount that was included in the Company previously reported closed sales amount. The Company adjusts the current year closed sales amount for differences between the prior years' reported closed sales amount and the actual revenues achieved in the first year of the applicable contract. Closed sales were adjusted by $(10.5) million , $(2.9) million and $(1.0) million for the fiscal years ended June 30, 2016 , 2015 and 2014 , respectively.

The higher recurring fee revenues of $154.7 million reflected gains from Net New Business (4pts), contributions from acquisitions (3pts) and internal growth (1pt). The higher distribution revenues of $54.4 million include $19.3 million from acquisitions. Closed sales for the fiscal year ended June 30, 2016 were $150.9 million , an increase of $4.5 million , or 3% , compared to $146.4 million for the fiscal year ended June 30, 2015 .

The increase primarily reflects: (i) higher labor costs of $41.4 million; (ii) higher distribution cost of revenues of $45.9 million driven by the increase in distribution revenues; (iii) higher cost of fee revenues related to acquisitions of $44.8 million; and (iv) higher production related operating expenses driven mostly by the increase in recurring and event-driven fee revenues. Fluctuations in foreign currency exchange rates decreased cost of fee revenues by $25.1 million. The higher distribution cost of revenues of $45.9 million includes $19.3 million from acquisitions. Selling, general and administrative expenses for the fiscal year ended June 30, 2016 were $420.9 million , an increase of $21.8 million , or 5% , compared to $399.1 million for the fiscal year ended June 30, 2015 . The increase was primarily due to: (i) higher costs related to acquisitions of $15.7 million; (ii) higher performance-based compensation expense of $6.8 million and (iii) higher selling and marketing expenses of $2.9 million as the Company continued to focus on increasing its sales capabilities, partially offset by (iv) lower professional services fees of $5.1 million. Operating income. Operating income for the fiscal year ended June 30, 2016 was $500.3 million , an increase of $33.4 million , or 7% , compared to $466.9 million for the fiscal year ended June 30, 2015 .

The decrease in the effective tax rate was primarily attributable to a greater recognition of tax benefits in fiscal year 2016 for the current year federal research and development tax credit and the Section 199 domestic production activities deduction. Net earnings and Basic and Diluted earnings per share . Net earnings for the fiscal year ended June 30, 2016 were $307.5 million , an increase of $20.4 million , or 7% , compared to $287.1 million for the fiscal year ended June 30, 2015 .

Operating income for the fiscal year ended June 30, 2015 was $466.9 million , an increase of $48.7 million , or 12% , compared to $418.2 million for the fiscal year ended June 30, 2014 . The increase is due to higher revenues, partially offset by higher operating expenses. Operating income margins increased to 17.3% for the fiscal year ended June 30, 2015 , compared to 16.3% for the fiscal year ended June 30, 2014 . Non-operating expenses, net. Non-operating expenses, net for the fiscal year ended June 30, 2015 were $28.0 million , an increase of $5.3 million , or 23% , compared to $22.7 million for the fiscal year ended June 30, 2014 . The increase was primarily due to $5.5 million of losses from equity method investments and higher interest expenses on our Long-term borrowings of $1.7 million, slightly offset by a $1.0 million increase in interest income. Earnings before income taxes . Earnings before income taxes for the fiscal year ended June 30, 2015 were $438.9 million , an increase of $43.4 million , or 11% , compared to $395.5 million for the fiscal year ended June 30, 2014 . The increase is mainly due to contributions from the growth in revenues and operating leverage. Provision for income taxes . The Provision for income taxes and the effective tax rates for the fiscal year ended June 30, 2015 were $151.8 million and 34.6% , respectively, compared to $132.5 million and 33.5% , for the fiscal year ended June 30, 2014 , respectively. The increase in the effective tax rate was primarily attributable to the cumulative tax benefits in fiscal year 2015 being less than the cumulative tax benefits in fiscal year 2014 . The cumulative tax benefits in fiscal year 2015 primarily related to the release of various tax reserves related to certain foreign, U.S. federal and state income taxes due to audit settlements and the expiration of certain audit periods, and the recognition of U.S. federal research and development credits based on the December 2014 legislative reinstatement of this credit for calendar year 2014 which collectively resulted in a net decrease to the effective tax rate of approximately 50 basis points. In fiscal year 2014 the cumulative tax benefits resulted in a net 85 basis point decrease to the effective tax rate. In addition to the lower cumulative tax benefits in fiscal year 2015 when compared to 2014 , the change in the effective tax rate was also negatively impacted by the geographical mix of income. In general, the Company foreign earnings are subject to a lower corporate income tax rates relative to the tax rate applied against U.S. income. In fiscal year 2015, the Company foreign earnings were approximately 17% of total company earnings before income taxes as compared to fiscal year 2014 when the Company foreign earnings were approximately 22% of total company earnings before income taxes. Net earnings and Basic and Diluted earnings per share . Net earnings for the fiscal year ended June 30, 2015 were $287.1 million , an increase of $24.1 million , or 9% , compared to $263.0 million for the fiscal year ended June 30, 2014 . The increase in Net earnings reflects higher revenues, and improvement in operating margins as discussed above. Basic and Diluted earnings per share for the fiscal year ended June 30, 2015 were $2.39 , an increase of $0.19 , or 9% , and $2.32 , an increase of $0.20 , or 9% , respectively, compared to $2.20 and $2.12 for the fiscal year ended June 30, 2014 , respectively ANALYSIS OF REPORTABLE SEGMENTS Broadridge has two reportable business segments: (1) Investor Communication Solutions and (2) Global Technology and Operations. The primary components of Other are the elimination of intersegment revenues and profits as well as certain unallocated expenses. Foreign currency exchange is a reconciling item between the actual foreign currency exchange rates and the constant foreign exchange rates used for internal management reporting. 32 Certain corporate expenses, as well as certain centrally managed expenses, are allocated based upon budgeted amounts in a reasonable manner. Because the Company compensates the management of its various businesses on, among other factors, segment profit, the Company may elect to record certain segment-related expense items in Other rather than reflect such items in segment profit.

The increase was attributable to higher recurring fee revenues of $109.2 million , higher event-driven fee revenues of $ 26.6 million and higher distribution revenues of $ 54.4 million . Higher recurring fee revenues of 10% were attributable to: (i) contributions from our recent acquisitions (5 pts); (ii) Net New Business primarily driven by increases in revenues from closed sales (5 pts); and (iii) internal growth (1 pt). Position growth compared to the same period in the prior year, which is a component of internal growth, was 3% for annual equity proxy communications and 4% for mutual fund interims and was the primary driver behind internal growth. Higher event-driven fee revenues were the result of increased mutual fund proxy and corporate re-organization communications activity. 33 Earnings before income taxes . Earnings before income taxes for the fiscal year ended June 30, 2016 were $409.1 million , an increase of $27.7 million , or 7% , compared to $381.4 million for the fiscal year ended June 30, 2015 . Pre-tax margins decreased by 0.4 percentage points to 18.4% primarily due to (i) higher operating expenses, and (ii) incremental operating and intangible amortization costs related to acquisitions, partially offset by (iii) earnings from higher recurring and event-driven revenues. Fiscal Year 2015 Compared to Fiscal Year 2014 Revenues. Investor Communication Solutions segment Revenues for the fiscal year ended June 30, 2015 were $2,030.2 million , an increase of $149.2 million , or 8% , compared to $1,881.0 million for the fiscal year ended June 30, 2014 . The increase was attributable to higher recurring fee revenues of $87.1 million , higher event-driven fee revenues of $17.2 million and higher distribution revenues of $44.9 million . Recurring fee revenue growth of 9% was the result of contributions from Net New Business (3 pts) from increases in revenue from closed sales, internal growth driven by market-based activities (3 pts), and contributions from our recent acquisitions (3 pts). Position growth, a component of internal growth, for mutual fund interim and annual equity proxy communications, was 8% and 7%, respectively, as compared to the same period in the prior year. Higher event-driven fee revenues were the result of increased equity proxy specials and contests. Earnings before income taxes . Earnings before income taxes for the fiscal year ended June 30, 2015 were $381.4 million , an increase of $45.1 million , or 13% , compared to $336.3 million for the fiscal year ended June 30, 2014 . Pre-tax margins increased by 0.9 percentage points to 18.8% mainly due to contributions from the growth in revenues more than offsetting (i) higher Selling, general and administrative expenses from acquisitions, (ii) the continued expansion of our sales capabilities, (iii) higher commissions due to growth in close sales, and (iv) losses from equity method investments. Global Technology and Operations Fiscal Year 2016 Compared to Fiscal Year 2015 Revenues . Global Technology and Operations segment Revenues for the fiscal year ended June 30, 2016 were $738.0 million , an increase of $45.5 million , or 7 %, compared to $692.5 million for the fiscal year ended June 30, 2015 . The increase was attributable to: (i) higher Net New Business from closed sales (3 pts); (ii) internal growth from increased usage of products and services as well as trading activity, partially offset by contract renewals (2 pts); and (iii) revenue from our recent acquisitions (1 pt). Earnings before income taxes . Earnings before income taxes for the fiscal year ended June 30, 2016 were $135.4 million , an increase of $15.1 million , or 13 %, compared to $120.3 million for the fiscal year ended June 30, 2015 . Pre-tax margins increase d by 0.9 percentage points from 17.4% to 18.3% for the fiscal year ended June 30, 2016 primarily due to higher revenues from closed sales and internal growth partially offset by incremental operating costs and the impact of recent acquisitions. Fiscal Year 2015 Compared to Fiscal Year 2014 Revenues . Global Technology and Operations segment Revenues for the fiscal year ended June 30, 2015 were $692.5 million , an increase of $11.8 million , or 2% , compared to $680.7 million for the fiscal year ended June 30, 2014 . The 2% increase was attributable to: (i) higher Net New Business (2pts) from increases in revenue from closed sales, and (ii) contributions from our recent acquisition (1pt). This was partially offset by lower internal growth (-1 pt) due to contract renewals and other equity services. Earnings before income taxes . Earnings before income taxes for the fiscal year ended June 30, 2015 were $120.3 million , an increase of $1.5 million , or 1% , compared to $118.8 million for the fiscal year ended June 30, 2014 . Pre-tax margins decreased by 0.1 percentage points from 17.5% to 17.4% for the fiscal year ended June 30, 2014 as a result of higher commissions due to growth in closed sales, continued expansion of our sales capabilities, incremental costs from our recent acquisition and lower contributions from the increase in revenues, partially offset by lower strategic initiative spend. Other Fiscal Year 2016 Compared to Fiscal Year 2015 Revenues . There were no significant reportable Revenues in our Other segment for the periods presented. 34 Loss before income taxes . Loss before income taxes was $79.0 million for the fiscal year ended June 30, 2016 , an increase of $5.5 million, or 7%, compared to $73.5 million for the fiscal year ended June 30, 2015 . The increased loss was mainly due to higher compensation expenses, which includes increased severance costs of $9.2 million and an increase in interest expense, partially offset by a reduction in the fair value of our obligation under contingent acquisition consideration arrangements of $4.9 million. Fiscal Year 2015 Compared to Fiscal Year 2014 Revenues . There were no significant reportable Revenues in our Other segment for the periods presented. Loss before income taxes . Loss before income taxes was $73.5 million for the fiscal year ended June 30, 2015 , a decrease of $1.8 million , or 2%, compared to $75.3 million for the fiscal year ended June 30, 2014 . The decreased loss was mainly due to a $7.6 million decrease in performance based compensation and benefits expense, partially offset by a $3.4 million change in the fair value of our obligations under contingent acquisition consideration arrangements and a $2.2 million increase in acquisition related expenses. Explanation and Reconciliation of the Company Use of Non-GAAP Financial Measures The Company results in this Annual Report on Form 10-K are presented in accordance with U.S. GAAP except where otherwise noted. In certain circumstances, results have been presented that are not generally accepted accounting principles measures ( Non-GAAP ). These Non-GAAP measures are Adjusted Operating income, Adjusted Net earnings, Adjusted Diluted earnings per share, and Free cash flows. These Non-GAAP financial measures should be viewed in addition to, and not as a substitute for, the Company reported results. The Company believes our Non-GAAP financial measures help investors understand how management plans, measures and evaluates the Company business performance. Management believes that Non-GAAP measures provide consistency in its financial reporting and facilitates investors understanding of the Company historical operating trends by providing an additional basis for comparisons to prior periods. Management uses these Non-GAAP financial measures to, among other things, evaluate our ongoing operations, for internal planning and forecasting purposes and in the calculation of performance-based compensation. In addition, and as a consequence of the importance of these Non-GAAP financial measures in managing our business, the Company Compensation Committee of the Board of Directors incorporates Non-GAAP financial measures in the evaluation process for determining management compensation. Adjusted Operating Income, Adjusted Net Earnings and Adjusted Diluted Earnings Per Share These Non-GAAP measures reflect Operating income, Net earnings, and Diluted earnings per share, as adjusted to exclude the impact of certain costs, expenses, gains and losses and other specified items that management believes are not indicative of our ongoing performance. These adjusted measures exclude the impact of Acquisition Amortization and Other Costs, which represent the amortization of acquired intangibles as well as other transaction costs and certain integration costs associated with the Company acquisition activities. We exclude Acquisition Amortization and Other Costs from these measures because excluding such information provides us with an understanding of the results from the primary operations of our business and these items do not reflect ordinary operations or earnings. Management believes that these measures may be useful to an investor in evaluating the underlying operating performance of our business. Free Cash Flows In addition to the Non-GAAP financial measures discussed above, we provide Free cash flow information because we consider Free cash flows to be a liquidity measure that provides useful information to management and investors about the amount of cash generated that could be used for dividends, share repurchases, strategic acquisitions and other discretionary investments. Free cash flows is a Non-GAAP financial measure and is defined by the Company as Net cash flows provided by operating activities less Capital expenditures, software purchases and capitalized internal use software. Set forth below is a reconciliation of such GAAP measures to the most directly comparable Non-GAAP measures (unaudited): 35 Years ended June 30, 2016 2015 2014 (in millions) Operating income (GAAP) $ 500.3 $ 466.9 $ 418.2 Adjustment: Acquisition Amortization and Other Costs 36.8 30.2 24.7 Adjusted Operating income (Non-GAAP) $ 537.1 $ 497.2 $ 442.9 Years ended June 30, 2016 2015 2014 (in millions) Net earnings (GAAP) $ 307.5 $ 287.1 $ 263.0 Adjustment: Acquisition Amortization and Other Costs 36.8 30.2 24.7 Tax impact of adjustment (12.7 ) (10.5 ) (8.7 ) Adjusted Net earnings (Non-GAAP) $ 331.7 $ 306.9 $ 279.0 Years ended June 30, 2016 2015 2014 Diluted earnings per share (GAAP) $ 2.53 $ 2.32 $ 2.12 Adjustment: Acquisition Amortization and Other Costs 0.30 0.24 0.20 Tax impact of adjustment (0.10 ) (0.08 ) (0.07 ) Adjusted Diluted earnings per share (Non-GAAP) $ 2.73 $ 2.47 $ 2.25 Note: Amounts may not sum due to rounding. Years ended June 30, 2016 2015 2014 (in millions) Net cash flows provided by operating activities (GAAP) $ 437.7 $ 431.4 $ 387.7 Adjustment: Capital expenditures, software purchases and capitalized internal use software (75.5 ) (66.0 ) (53.4 ) Free cash flows (Non-GAAP) $ 362.2 $ 365.4 $ 334.3 FINANCIAL CONDITION, LIQUIDITY AND CAPITAL RESOURCES Cash and cash equivalents consisted of the following: June 30, 2016 2015 (in millions) Cash and cash equivalents: Domestic cash $ 497.3 $ 72.3 Cash held by foreign subsidiaries 174.3 209.1 Cash held by regulated entities 56.1 42.7 Total cash and cash equivalents $ 727.7 $ 324.1 36 At June 30, 2016 and 2015 , Cash and cash equivalents were $727.7 million and $324.1 million , respectively. Total stockholders equity was $1,045.5 million and $927.8 million at June 30, 2016 and 2015 , respectively. At June 30, 2016 , net working capital was $596.1 million , compared to $352.5 million at June 30, 2015 . At the current time, and in future periods, we expect cash generated by our operations, together with existing cash, cash equivalents and borrowings from the capital markets, to be sufficient to cover cash needs for working capital, capital expenditures, strategic acquisitions, dividends and common stock repurchases. In July 2016, shortly after the end of the 2016 fiscal year, we completed the acquisition of the NACC business of DST Systems, Inc. The aggregate purchase price was $410.0 million in cash, subject to customary working capital and other closing adjustments. On July 5, 2016, we converted $111.5 million Canadian dollars to U.S. dollars as part of the funding for this acquisition. As of June 30, 2016 , $174.3 million of the $727.7 million of Cash and cash equivalents was held by our foreign subsidiaries, and $56.1 million of Cash and cash equivalents were held by regulated entities. We expect existing domestic cash, cash equivalents, and cash flows from operations to continue to be sufficient to fund our domestic operating activities and cash commitments for investing and financing activities, such as regular quarterly dividends, debt repayment schedules, and material capital expenditures, for at least the next 12 months and thereafter for the foreseeable future. In addition, we expect existing foreign cash, cash equivalents, and cash flows from operations to continue to be sufficient to fund our foreign operating activities and cash commitments for investing activities, such as material capital expenditures, for at least the next 12 months and thereafter for the foreseeable future. If these funds are needed for our operations in the U.S., we would be required to accrue and pay U.S. taxes to repatriate these funds. However, our current plans do not demonstrate a need to repatriate them to fund our U.S. operations, as we consider these funds to be permanently reinvested outside the U.S. Outstanding borrowings and available capacity under the Company borrowing arrangements were as follows: Book Value Expiration Date Par Value June 30, 2016 June 30, 2015 Unused Available Capacity at June 30, 2016 Fair Value at June 30, 2016 (in millions) Current portion of long-term debt Fiscal 2007 Senior Notes (a) June 2017 $ 125.0 $ 124.9 $ $ $ 129.1 $ 125.0 $ 124.9 $ $ $ 129.1 Long-term debt, excluding current portion Fiscal 2015 Revolving Credit Facility August 2019 $ $ $ 165.0 $ 750.0 $ Fiscal 2007 Senior Notes (a) June 2017 124.8 Fiscal 2014 Senior Notes September 2020 400.0 399.7 399.6 427.6 Fiscal 2016 Senior Notes June 2026 500.0 497.9 507.9 $ 900.0 $ 897.6 $ 689.4 $ 750.0 $ 935.5 Total debt $ 1,025.0 $ 1,022.5 $ 689.4 $ 750.0 $ 1,064.6 (a) The Fiscal 2007 Senior Notes were reclassified from Long-term debt to Current portion of long-term debt in June 2016 to reflect the remaining maturity of less than one year. At June 30, 2016 , the Company had $1,022.5 million of outstanding Long-term debt, consisting of a senior note of $124.9 million principal amount due June 2017 , a senior note of $399.7 million principal amount due September 2020 and a senior note of $497.9 million principal amount due June 2026. The credit facility and the senior notes are senior unsecured obligations of the Company and rank equally with the Company other senior indebtedness. Interest on the senior notes due 2017 is payable semiannually on June 1 st and December 1 st each year based on a fixed per annum rate equal to 6.125%. Interest on the senior notes due 2020 is payable semiannually on March 1 st and September 1 st each year based on a fixed per annum rate equal to 3.95%. Interest on the senior notes due 2026 is payable semiannually on June 27 th and December 27 th each year based on a fixed per annum rate equal to 3.40%. 37 On August 14, 2014, the Company entered into an amended and restated $750.0 million five -year revolving credit facility (the Fiscal 2015 Revolving Credit Facility ), which replaced the Fiscal 2012 Revolving Credit Facility. The Fiscal 2015 Revolving Credit Facility is comprised of a $670.0 million U.S. dollar tranche and an $80.0 million multicurrency tranche. At June 30, 2016 , the Company had no outstanding borrowings and had unused available capacity of $750.0 million under the Fiscal 2015 Revolving Credit Facility. The weighted-average interest rate on the Fiscal 2015 Revolving Credit Facility was 1.30% and 1.18% for the fiscal years ended June 30, 2016 and 2015, respectively. The fair value of the variable-rate Fiscal 2015 Revolving Credit Facility borrowings at June 30, 2016 approximates carrying value. Borrowings under the Fiscal 2015 Revolving Credit Facility can be made in tranches up to 360 days and bear interest at the London Interbank Offered Rate ( LIBOR ) plus 100 basis points. In addition, the Fiscal 2015 Revolving Credit Facility has an annual facility fee equal to 12.5 basis points on the entire facility, which totaled $1.0 million and $0.8 million for the fiscal years ended June 30, 2016 and 2015, respectively. The Company incurred $1.9 million in debt issuance costs to establish the Fiscal 2015 Revolving Credit Facility. During the quarter ended September 30, 2014, the Company expensed $0.1 million of issuance costs related to certain lenders from the 2012 Revolving Credit Facility that did not participate in the Fiscal 2015 Revolving Credit Facility. As of June 30, 2016 , $1.5 million of these costs remain to be amortized (including $0.3 million of issuance costs from the Fiscal 2012 Revolving Credit Facility). Such costs are capitalized in Other non-current assets in the Consolidated Balance Sheets and are being amortized to Non-operating expenses, net on a straight-line basis, which approximates the effective interest method, over the term of this facility. The Company may voluntarily prepay, in whole or in part and without premium or penalty, borrowings under the Fiscal 2015 Revolving Credit Facility at any tranche maturity date. The Fiscal 2015 Revolving Credit Facility is subject to covenants, including financial covenants consisting of a leverage ratio and an interest coverage ratio. At June 30, 2016 , the Company is in compliance with the financial covenants of the Fiscal 2015 Revolving Credit Facility.

The Company may redeem the Fiscal 2007 Senior Notes in whole or in part at any time before their maturity. The Company incurred $1.9 million in debt issuance costs to establish the Fiscal 2007 Senior Notes. These costs have been capitalized and are being amortized to Non-operating expenses, net on a straight-line basis, which approximates the effective interest method, over the ten -year term.

Cash Flows Fiscal Year 2016 Compared to Fiscal Year 2015 Years Ended June 30, 2016 2015 $ Change (in millions) Net cash flows provided by operating activities $ 437.7 $ 431.4 $ 6.3 Net cash flows used in investing activities $ (136.9 ) $ (276.4 ) $ 139.5 Net cash flows provided by (used in) financing activities $ 108.6 $ (158.3 ) $ 266.9 Free cash flows: Net cash flows provided by operating activities (GAAP) $ 437.7 $ 431.4 $ 6.3 Capital expenditures, software purchases and capitalized internal use software (75.5 ) (66.0 ) (9.5 ) Free cash flows (Non-GAAP) $ 362.2 $ 365.4 $ (3.2 ) The increase in cash provided by operating activities of $6.3 million was due to: (A) $42.4 million of increased cash provided by (i) an increase in net earnings of $20.4 million; combined with (ii) an increase in non-cash expense add-backs and other adjustments of $10.5 million; and (iii) a decrease in working capital of $11.5 million, notwithstanding the collection of a $26.1 million tax refund by a Canadian subsidiary in the prior year that did not recur; offset by: (B) $36.1 million of increased cash used in non-current assets and liabilities due primarily to long-term client contracts. The decrease in free cash flows of $3.2 million was driven by an increase in Net cash flows provided by operating activities of $6.3 million , partially offset by increased capital expenditures, software purchases and capitalized internal use software of $9.5 million . The decrease in cash used in investing activities of $139.5 million primarily reflects lower spending of $149.9 million on acquisitions in the current fiscal year as compared to the prior fiscal year, partially offset by higher capital expenditures and purchases of intangibles of $9.5 million in the current fiscal year as compared to the prior fiscal year. The increased cash provided by financing activities of $266.9 million reflects a $181.9 million decrease in the purchases of common stock in the current fiscal year compared to the prior fiscal year and an increase in net proceeds from borrowings of 39 $167.9 million in the current year compared to the prior fiscal year, partially offset by a decrease of $37.3 million in proceeds from stock options the current fiscal year as compared to the prior fiscal year, a decrease of $19.2 million in excess tax benefits from the issuance of stock-based compensation awards and a $15.9 million increase in dividends paid. Fiscal Year 2015 Compared to Fiscal Year 2014 Years Ended June 30, 2015 2014 $ Change (in millions) Net cash flows provided by operating activities $ 431.4 $ 387.7 $ 43.7 Net cash flows used in investing activities $ (276.4 ) $ (150.3 ) $ (126.1 ) Net cash flows used in financing activities $ (158.3 ) $ (158.9 ) $ 0.6 Free cash flows: Net cash flows provided by operating activities (GAAP) $ 431.4 $ 387.7 $ 43.7 Capital expenditures, software purchases and capitalized internal use software (66.0 ) (53.4 ) (12.6 ) Free cash flows (Non-GAAP) $ 365.4 $ 334.3 $ 31.1 The increase in cash provided by operating activities is primarily due to higher net earnings and changes in working capital resulting from the timing of accounts receivable collections and vendor payments, which includes the collection of a $26.1 million tax refund by a Canadian subsidiary resulting from the prior settlement and execution of the Advanced Pricing Agreement with the Internal Revenue Service and Canadian Revenue Authority. The increase in free cash flows of $31.1 million was driven by an increase in Net cash flows provided by operating activities of $43.7 million , partially offset by increased capital expenditures and purchases of intangibles of $12.6 million . The increase in Net cash flows used in investing activities primarily reflects higher spending of $106.0 million on acquisitions during the fiscal year ended June 30, 2015 , compared to the fiscal year ended June 30, 2014 , as well as higher capital expenditures and purchases of intangibles of $12.6 million in the current fiscal year as compared to the prior fiscal year. The decreased use of Net cash flows used in financing activities reflects net proceeds from borrowings on the revolving credit facility of $165.0 million in the current year coupled with an increase of $17.7 million in excess tax benefits from the issuance of stock-based compensation awards and an increase of $12.6 million in proceeds from stock options in the current fiscal year as compared to the prior fiscal year. The increased sources were offset by a $172.0 million increase in the purchases of common stock in the current fiscal year compared to the prior fiscal year and a $25.6 million increase in dividends paid. Income Taxes The Company, headquartered in the U.S., is routinely examined by the IRS and is also routinely examined by the tax authorities in the U.S. states and foreign countries in which it conducts business.

To the extent the Company determines it has potential tax assessment in particular tax jurisdictions, the Company has established tax reserves which it believes are adequate in relation to the potential assessments. Once established, reserves are adjusted when there is more information available, when an event occurs necessitating a change to the reserves or the statute of limitations for the relevant taxing authority to examine the tax position has expired. The resolution of tax matters should not have a material effect on the financial condition of the Company or on the Company Consolidated Statements of Earnings for a particular future period.
