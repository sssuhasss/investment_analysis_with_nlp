Item 7. Management Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations This Management Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations, or MD&A, should be read in conjunction with our consolidated financial statements and notes thereto that appear elsewhere in this annual report on Form 10-K. See Risk Factors elsewhere in this annual report on Form 10-K for a discussion of certain risks associated with our business. The following discussion contains forward-looking statements. The forward-looking statements do not include the potential impact of any mergers, acquisitions, divestitures or other events that may be announced after the date hereof. Overview We provide solutions for delivering, optimizing and securing content and business applications over the Internet. The key factors that influence our financial success are our ability to build on recurring revenue commitments for our performance and security offerings, increase media traffic on our network, develop new products and carefully manage our capital spending and other expenses. 21 Table of Contents Revenue For most of our solutions, our customers commit to contracts having terms of a year or longer, which allows us to have a consistent and predictable base level of revenue. In addition to a base level of revenue, we are also dependent on media customers where usage of our solutions is more variable. As a result, our revenue is impacted by the amount of media and software download traffic we serve on our network, the rate of adoption of gaming, social media and video platform offerings, the timing and variability of customer-specific one-time events and the impact of seasonal variations on our business. The ability to expand our product portfolio and to effectively manage the prices we charge for our solutions are also key factors impacting our revenue growth. We have observed the following trends related to our revenue in recent years: Increased sales of our security solutions have made a significant contribution to revenue growth. We plan to continue to invest in this area with a focus on further enhancing our product portfolio and extending our go-to-market capabilities. We have increased committed recurring revenue from our solutions by increasing sales of incremental solutions to our existing customers and adding new customers; however, we have also experienced slower revenue growth in recent quarters particularly in our web performance solutions. We expect the trend of slower revenue growth to continue in 2019 as our commerce customers experience financial pressure, we face contract renewals with large media and other customers and we experience the absence of as many large media-driven events in 2019 as compared to 2018. The prices paid by some of our customers have declined particularly in the context of contract renewals, reflecting the impact of competition. Our revenue would have been higher absent these price declines. We have experienced increases in the amount of traffic delivered for customers that use our solutions for video, gaming, social media and software downloads, contributing to an increase in our revenue. However, in recent years we have experienced moderation in traffic usage from, and revenue attributable to, large Internet platform companies such as Amazon, Apple, Facebook, Google, Microsoft and Netflix that rely on their internal infrastructure to deliver more of their media content. We refer to these companies as our Internet Platform Customers. We do not anticipate their usage of our solutions to decrease at the same rate in the future. We have experienced variations in certain types of revenue from quarter to quarter. In particular, we experience higher revenue in the fourth quarter of each year for some of our solutions as a result of holiday season activity. In addition, we experience quarterly variations in revenue attributable to, among other things, the nature and timing of software and gaming releases by our customers using our software download solutions; whether there are large live sporting or other events that increase the amount of media traffic on our network; and the frequency and timing of purchases of custom solutions. Expenses Our level of profitability is also impacted by our expenses, including direct costs to support our revenue such as bandwidth and co-location costs. We have observed the following trends related to our profitability in recent years: Our profitability improved significantly in 2018 as compared to 2017 due to higher revenues as well as the effects of cost savings and efficiency initiatives we have undertaken. We expect to continue to undertake efforts intended to improve the efficiency of operations. We anticipate profitability improvement in 2019 but at a lower rate as compared to 2018. We believe we can achieve additional improvement in 2020. Network bandwidth costs represent a significant portion of our cost of revenue. Historically, we have been able to mitigate increases in these costs by reducing our network bandwidth costs per unit and investing in internal-use software development to improve the performance and efficiency of our network. Our total bandwidth costs may increase in the future as a result of expected higher traffic levels and serving more traffic from higher cost regions. We will need to continue to effectively manage our bandwidth costs to maintain current levels of profitability. 22 Table of Contents Co-location costs are also a significant portion of our cost of revenue. By improving our internal-use software and managing our hardware deployments to enable us to use servers more efficiently, we have been able to manage the growth of co-location costs. We expect to continue to scale our network in the future and will need to continue to effectively manage our co-location costs to maintain current levels of profitability. Payroll and related compensation costs grew in 2018 due to headcount increases in 2017, particularly in our professional services and engineering teams to support our revenue growth and strategic initiatives. During the year ended December 31, 2017 we increased our headcount by approximately 1,100 employees, while headcount remained relatively flat during 2018. We expect to continue to hire employees, both domestically and internationally, in support of our strategic initiatives but do not expect overall headcount to increase significantly in 2019. Depreciation and amortization expense related to our network equipment and internal-use software development costs increased by $51.2 million during 2018 as compared to 2017. Due to the software and hardware initiatives we have undertaken to manage our global network more efficiently, we expect the useful lives of our network assets to be extended. This change is expected to decrease depreciation expense related to our network equipment during 2019 as compared to 2018. We retrospectively adopted the new accounting standard for revenue recognition on January 1, 2018; accordingly, prior period results have been revised for the adoption of the new standard. The changes to our revenue recognition approach under this new standard primarily impact the timing of recognizing revenue from a small number of licensed software customers. There is little impact to revenue from our core Web and Media solutions. As a result of the change, we also began capitalizing certain commission and incentive payments. The revisions as a result of adopting the new standard did not have a material impact on our annual revenue or results of operations, but did cause quarter-over-quarter fluctuations. We report our revenue by division, which is a customer-focused reporting view that reflects revenue from customers that are managed by the division. As of January 1, 2018, we now report our revenue in two divisions compared to the three divisions reported in 2017; the Media Division and Enterprise and Carrier Division were combined to form the new Media and Carrier Division. As the purchasing patterns and required account expertise of customers change over time, we may reassign a customer from one division to another. In 2018, we reassigned some of our customers from the Media and Carrier Division to the Web Division and revised historical results in order to reflect the most recent categorization and to provide a comparable view for all periods presented. 23 Table of Contents Results of Operations The following sets forth, as a percentage of revenue, consolidated statements of income data for the years indicated: 2018 2017 2016 Revenue 100.0 % 100.0 % 100.0 % Costs and operating expenses: Cost of revenue (exclusive of amortization of acquired intangible assets shown below) 35.1 35.2 34.5 Research and development 9.1 8.9 7.1 Sales and marketing 19.1 19.3 18.2 General and administrative 21.1 20.5 18.7 Amortization of acquired intangible assets 1.2 1.2 1.1 Restructuring charge 1.0 2.2 0.4 Total costs and operating expenses 86.6 87.3 80.0 Income from operations 13.4 12.7 20.0 Interest income 1.0 0.7 0.6 Interest expense (1.6 ) (0.8 ) (0.8 ) Other (expense) income, net (0.1 ) 0.2 Income before provision for income taxes 12.7 12.6 20.0 Provision for income taxes 1.6 3.7 6.2 Net income 11.1 % 8.9 % 13.8 % Revenue Revenue during the periods presented is as follows (in thousands): For the Years Ended December 31, For the Years Ended December 31, 2018 2017 % Change % Change at Constant Currency 2017 2016 % Change % Change at Constant Currency Web Division $ 1,446,052 $ 1,305,401 10.8 % 10.2 % $ 1,305,401 $ 1,138,492 14.7 % 14.7 % Media and Carrier Division 1,268,422 1,183,634 7.2 6.8 1,183,634 1,209,496 (2.1 ) (2.1 ) Total revenue $ 2,714,474 $ 2,489,035 9.1 % 8.6 % $ 2,489,035 $ 2,347,988 6.0 % 6.0 % The increase in our revenue in 2018 as compared to 2017 was primarily the result of higher media traffic volumes, increased sales of our new product offerings and continued strong growth in our Cloud Security Solutions. Cloud Security Solutions revenue for the year ended December 31, 2018 was $657.9 million, compared to $485.5 million for the year ended December 31, 2017, which represents a 35.5% increase. The increase in our revenue in 2017 as compared to 2016 was primarily the result of continued strong growth from our Cloud Security Solutions and from new product introductions. Overall, however, the revenue growth rates for 2017 were negatively impacted by the "do-it-yourself" efforts of our Internet Platform Customers. Cloud Security Solutions revenue for the year ended December 31, 2017 was $485.5 million, compared to $369.0 million for the year ended December 31, 2016, which represents a 31.6% increase. The increase in Web Division revenue for 2018 as compared to 2017 was due to increased purchases of new solutions and upgrades to existing services by this customer base. Increased sales of our Cloud Security Solutions to Web Division customers, in particular our Kona Site Defender and Prolexic solutions, as well as our new Bot Manager offering were a principal contributor to our overall revenue growth. The increase in Web Division revenue in 2017 as compared to 2016 was due to increased demand across most of our customer base, particularly for our Cloud Security Solutions. 24 Table of Contents The increase in Media and Carrier Division revenue for 2018 as compared to 2017 was primarily the result of increased customer traffic volumes from video delivery and gaming customers and sales of Cloud Security Solutions to this customer base. The increase in Media and Carrier Division revenue was partially offset by a decline in revenue from our Internet Platform Customers to $174.8 million in 2018 as compared to $203.3 million in 2017. Excluding these customers, revenue increased within the Media and Carrier Division by 11.7% for 2018 as compared to 2017. The decrease in Media and Carrier Division revenue for 2017 as compared to 2016 , was primarily the result of decreased traffic from our Internet Platform Customers. Excluding these customers, revenue increased within the Media and Carrier Division by 2.6% for 2017 as compared to 2016. Revenue derived in the U.S. and internationally during the periods presented is as follows (in thousands): For the Years Ended December 31, For the Years Ended December 31, 2018 2017 % Change % Change at Constant Currency 2017 2016 % Change % Change at Constant Currency U.S. $ 1,683,272 $ 1,637,198 2.8 % 2.8 % $ 1,637,198 $ 1,629,298 0.5 % 0.5 % International 1,031,202 851,837 21.1 19.7 851,837 718,690 18.5 18.6 Total revenue $ 2,714,474 $ 2,489,035 9.1 % 8.6 % $ 2,489,035 $ 2,347,988 6.0 % 6.0 % The reduced revenue from our Internet Platform Customers negatively impacted our U.S. revenue growth rates for the years ended December 31, 2018 and 2017 , as these customers are based in the U.S. For the year ended December 31, 2018 , approximately 38% of our revenue was derived from our operations located outside of the U.S., compared to 34% for the year ended December 31, 2017 , and 31% for the year ended December 31, 2016 . No single country outside of the U.S. accounted for 10% or more of revenue during any of these periods. During 2018 and 2017 , we continued to see strong revenue growth from our operations in the Asia-Pacific region. Changes in foreign currency exchange rates positively impacted our revenue by $11.2 million in 2018 as compared to 2017 , and negatively impacted our revenue by $0.4 million in 2017 as compared to 2016 . Cost of Revenue Cost of revenue consisted of the following for the periods presented (in thousands): For the Years Ended December 31, For the Years Ended December 31, 2018 2017 % Change 2017 2016 % Change Bandwidth fees $ 154,853 $ 168,092 (7.9 )% $ 168,092 $ 168,202 (0.1 )% Co-location fees 128,082 130,181 (1.6 ) 130,181 129,904 0.2 Network build-out and supporting services 88,543 75,209 17.7 75,209 61,320 22.7 Payroll and related costs 238,920 216,760 10.2 216,760 189,514 14.4 Stock-based compensation, including amortization of prior capitalized amounts 45,765 36,677 24.8 36,677 31,145 17.8 Depreciation of network equipment 150,458 143,825 4.6 143,825 140,777 2.2 Amortization of internal-use software 146,864 105,093 39.7 105,093 88,244 19.1 Total cost of revenue $ 953,485 $ 875,837 8.9 % $ 875,837 $ 809,106 8.2 % As a percentage of revenue 35.1 % 35.2 % 35.2 % 34.5 % 25 Table of Contents The increase in total cost of revenue for 2018 as compared to 2017 was primarily due to increases in: amortization of internal-use software as we continued to release internally-developed software onto our network related to new product launches and significant enhancements to our existing services throughout 2017 and 2018; payroll and related costs, as well as stock-based compensation, due to increased hiring in our services team in 2017 to support revenue growth; and amounts paid for network build-out and supporting services related to installation fees and investments in our network. These increases were partially offset by decreases in our bandwidth and co-location fees as we have been able to more effectively manage our network and reduce our costs. The increase in total cost of revenue for 2017 as compared to 2016 was primarily due to increases in: payroll and related costs, as well as stock-based compensation, due to increased hiring in our services team to support revenue growth; amounts paid for network build-out and supporting services related to investments in network expansion to support our expanding web performance and cloud security solutions as a result of new product launches and our acquisitions; and amortization of internal-use software as we continued to release internally-developed software onto our network as a result of new product launches and significant enhancements to our existing services. We have long-term purchase commitments for co-location services and bandwidth usage with various vendors and network and Internet service providers. Our minimum commitments related to bandwidth usage and co-location services may vary from period to period depending on the timing and length of contract renewals with our service providers. See Note 12 to our consolidated financial statements included elsewhere in this annual report on Form 10-K for details regarding our bandwidth usage and co-location services purchase commitments. During 2019 we plan to continue to focus our efforts on expanding our operating margins, including continuing to manage our bandwidth and co-location costs. We do anticipate amortization of internal-use software development costs will increase in 2019 as we plan to continue making investments in our network with the expectation that our customer base will continue to expand and that we will continue to deliver more traffic to existing customers; however, these costs are not expected to increase as a percentage of revenue. We also expect to change the estimated useful lives of our network servers from four years to five years. Due to software and hardware initiatives we have undertaken to manage our global network more efficiently, we expect the useful lives our of network assets to be extended. This change is expected to decrease depreciation expense related to our network equipment during 2019 as compared to 2018. Research and Development Expenses Research and development expenses consisted of the following for the periods presented (in thousands): For the Years Ended December 31, For the Years Ended December 31, 2018 2017 % Change 2017 2016 % Change Payroll and related costs $ 365,713 $ 322,604 13.4 % $ 322,604 $ 253,351 27.3 % Stock-based compensation 44,034 38,863 13.3 38,863 29,739 30.7 Capitalized salaries and related costs (174,373 ) (148,998 ) 17.0 (148,998 ) (122,084 ) 22.0 Other expenses 10,791 9,965 8.3 9,965 6,622 50.5 Total research and development $ 246,165 $ 222,434 10.7 % $ 222,434 $ 167,628 32.7 % As a percentage of revenue 9.1 % 8.9 % 8.9 % 7.1 % The increases in research and development expenses for 2018 as compared to 2017 and 2017 as compared to 2016 , were due to increases in payroll and related costs as a result of headcount growth in 2017 to support investments in new product development and network scaling, and as a result of employees acquired through acquisitions. These increases were partially offset by increases in capitalized salaries and related costs due to continued investment in internal-use software deployed on our network. 26 Table of Contents Stock-based compensation in 2017 as compared to 2016 increased due to increased headcount and market adjustments of award sizes to existing employees due to competition for certain engineering talent. Research and development costs are expensed as incurred, other than certain internal-use software development costs eligible for capitalization. Capitalized development costs consist of payroll and related costs for personnel and external consulting expenses involved in the development of internal-use software used to deliver our services and operate our network. For the years ended December 31, 2018, 2017 and 2016 , we capitalized $31.9 million , $26.8 million and $21.4 million , respectively, of stock-based compensation. These capitalized internal-use software development costs are amortized to cost of revenue over their estimated useful lives, which is generally two years, but can be up to seven years based on the software developed and its expected useful life. We expect research and development costs to increase in 2019 as we maintain our focus on innovation. However, we do not expect these costs to increase as a percentage of revenue. Sales and Marketing Expenses Sales and marketing expenses consisted of the following for the periods presented (in thousands): For the Years Ended December 31, For the Years Ended December 31, 2018 2017 % Change 2017 2016 % Change Payroll and related costs $ 388,320 $ 342,719 13.3 % $ 342,719 $ 310,099 10.5 % Stock-based compensation 64,372 60,247 6.8 60,247 55,407 8.7 Marketing programs and related costs 41,796 48,551 (13.9 ) 48,551 36,904 31.6 Other expenses 22,865 30,005 (23.8 ) 30,005 25,475 17.8 Total sales and marketing $ 517,353 $ 481,522 7.4 % $ 481,522 $ 427,885 12.5 % As a percentage of revenue 19.1 % 19.3 % 19.3 % 18.2 % The increases in sales and marketing expenses for 2018 as compared to 2017 and 2017 as compared to 2016 were primarily due to growth in payroll and related costs from headcount increases in 2017 to support our divisions' go-to-market strategies in pursuit of growth opportunities. Our marketing programs and related costs in 2017 as compared to 2016, also increased in support of our go-to-market strategies and ongoing geographic expansion. During 2019 we plan to continue to focus our efforts on expanding our operating margins, while we continue to refine and optimize our go-to-market efforts. General and Administrative Expenses General and administrative expenses consisted of the following for the periods presented (in thousands): For the Years Ended December 31, For the Years Ended December 31, 2018 2017 % Change 2017 2016 % Change Payroll and related costs $ 188,635 $ 194,199 (2.9 )% $ 194,199 $ 163,348 18.9 % Stock-based compensation 53,514 44,884 19.2 44,884 41,073 9.3 Depreciation and amortization 80,014 76,128 5.1 76,128 65,780 15.7 Facilities-related costs 86,107 80,452 7.0 80,452 72,549 10.9 Provision for doubtful accounts 2,672 3,209 (16.7 ) 3,209 1,235 159.8 Acquisition-related costs 2,868 23,373 (87.7 ) 23,373 1,028 2,173.6 License of patent (17,146 ) (16,421 ) 4.4 (16,421 ) (8,577 ) 91.5 Legal and stockholder matter costs 23,091 nm Endowment of Akamai Foundation 50,000 nm Professional fees and other expenses 104,312 103,341 0.9 103,341 103,480 (0.1 ) Total general and administrative $ 574,067 $ 509,165 12.7 % $ 509,165 $ 439,916 15.7 % As a percentage of revenue 21.1 % 20.5 % 20.5 % 18.7 % 27 Table of Contents The increase in total general and administrative expenses for 2018 as compared to 2017 was primarily due to increases in: a one-time endowment to the Akamai Foundation, an organization founded by certain current and former employees of the Company with a mission of supporting youth education, with a focus on mathematics, as well as other charitable causes; legal and stockholder matter costs related to a settlement charge from our litigation with Limelight Networks, Inc., or Limelight, and costs related to amounts paid to professional service providers for advisory services provided in connection with a non-routine stockholder matter; and stock-based compensation, primarily due to performance-based awards which experienced higher achievement in 2018 as compared to 2017. These increases were partially offset by a decrease to acquisition-related costs due to the release of an indemnification receivable in 2017 related to a prior acquisition and a decrease to payroll and related costs as a result of our efficiency efforts. The increase in total general and administrative expenses for 2017 as compared to 2016 was primarily due to increases in: payroll and related costs, specifically in our network infrastructure and information technology functions in support of our security infrastructure growth and network scaling and efficiency efforts; facilities-related costs and depreciation and amortization due to expansion of company infrastructure throughout 2016 and 2017 to support investments in engineering, go-to-market capacity and enterprise expansion initiatives, particularly expansion of our facility footprint; and acquisition-related costs due to the release of an indemnification receivable related to a prior acquisition. General and administrative expenses for 2018 and 2017 are broken out by category as follows (in thousands): For the Years Ended December 31, For the Years Ended December 31, 2018 2017 % Change 2017 2016 % Change Global functions 197,377 $ 201,539 (2.1 )% $ 201,539 $ 189,485 6.4 % As a percentage of revenue 7.3 % 8.1 % 8.1 % 8.1 % Infrastructure 308,915 297,465 3.8 297,465 255,855 16.3 As a percentage of revenue 11.4 % 12.0 % 12.0 % 10.9 % Other 67,775 10,161 567.0 10,161 (5,424 ) nm Total general and administrative expenses $ 574,067 $ 509,165 12.7 % $ 509,165 $ 439,916 15.7 % As a percentage of revenue 21.1 % 20.5 % 20.5 % 18.7 % Global functions expense includes payroll, stock-based compensation and other employee-related costs for administrative functions, including finance, purchasing, order entry, human resources, legal, information technology and executive personnel, as well as third-party professional service fees. Infrastructure expense includes payroll, stock-based compensation and other employee-related costs for our network infrastructure functions, as well as facility rent expense, depreciation and amortization of facility and IT-related assets, software and software-related costs, business insurance and taxes. Our network infrastructure function is responsible for network planning, sourcing, architecture evaluation and platform security. Other expense includes acquisition-related costs, provision for doubtful accounts, legal settlements, non-routine stockholder matter costs, the endowment of the Akamai Foundation, transformation costs and the license of a patent. The increase in other general and administrative expenses in 2018 as compared to 2017 was the result of a one-time endowment to the Akamai Foundation, costs related to the settlement of litigation with Limelight and amounts paid to professional service providers for advisory services in connection with a non-routine stockholder matter. The increase in infrastructure general and administrative expenses in 2017 as compared to 2016 was the result of facilities-related costs and depreciation and amortization due to expansion of company infrastructure throughout 2016 and 2017 to support investments in engineering, go-to-market capacity and enterprise expansion initiatives, particularly expansion of our facility footprint. The increase in other general and administrative expenses in 2017 as compared to 2016 was due to the release of an indemnification receivable related to a prior acquisition. 28 Table of Contents During 2019 we plan to continue to focus our efforts on expanding our operating margins, and in particular, assessing areas of third-party spending and the automation of manual tasks. Amortization of Acquired Intangible Assets For the Years Ended December 31, For the Years Ended December 31, (in thousands) 2018 2017 % Change 2017 2016 % Change Amortization of acquired intangible assets $ 33,311 $ 30,904 7.8 % $ 30,904 $ 26,642 16.0 % As a percentage of revenue 1.2 % 1.2 % 1.2 % 1.1 % The increase in amortization of acquired intangible assets in 2018 as compared to 2017 and 2017 as compared to 2016 was the result of amortization of assets related to our 2016 and 2017 acquisitions. Based on acquired intangible assets as of December 31, 2018 , future amortization is expected to be approximately $36.6 million , $33.9 million , $28.0 million , $22.4 million and $17.1 million for the years ending December 31, 2019 , 2020 , 2021 , 2022 and 2023 , respectively. Restructuring Charge For the Years Ended December 31, For the Years Ended December 31, (in thousands) 2018 2017 % Change 2017 2016 % Change Restructuring charge $ 27,594 $ 54,884 (49.7 )% $ 54,884 $ 10,301 432.8 % As a percentage of revenue 1.0 % 2.2 % 2.2 % 0.4 % The restructuring charge in 2018 was primarily the result of management actions intended to re-balance investments to ensure long-term growth and scale. The restructuring charge relates to certain headcount reductions and software charges for software not yet placed into service that will not be implemented due to this action. The restructuring charge in 2017 was primarily the result of management actions intended to shift focus to more critical areas of the business and away from products that have not seen expected commercial success. The restructuring was also intended to facilitate cost efficiencies and savings. The restructuring charge relates to certain headcount and facility reductions and certain capitalized internal-use software charges for software not yet placed into service that will not be completed and implemented due to this action. The restructuring charge in 2016 was primarily the result of changes to our organizational structure to reorganize and consolidate our products and development groups and global sales, services and marketing teams into divisions centered on our solutions. The restructuring charge relates to severance expenses for impacted employees and charges for internal-use software not yet placed into service that will not be completed and launched due to changing priorities as part of the reorganization. In addition to the actions described above, we have also recognized restructuring charges for redundant employees, facilities and contracts associated with completed acquisitions in each of the three years presented. We expect to incur additional restructuring charges of up to $12.0 million in 2019 as a result of the action committed to in the fourth quarter of 2018. These charges will include severance and related expenses for terminations in the first quarter of 2019. 29 Table of Contents Non-Operating Income (Expense) For the Years Ended December 31, For the Years Ended December 31, (in thousands) 2018 2017 % Change 2017 2016 % Change Interest income $ 26,940 $ 17,855 50.9 % $ 17,855 $ 14,702 21.4 % As a percentage of revenue 1.0 % 0.7 % 0.7 % 0.6 % Interest expense $ (43,202 ) $ (18,839 ) 129.3 % $ (18,839 ) $ (18,638 ) 1.1 % As a percentage of revenue (1.6 )% (0.8 )% (0.8 )% (0.8 )% Other (expense) income, net $ (3,148 ) $ 887 (454.9 )% $ 887 $ 3,788 (76.6 )% As a percentage of revenue (0.1 )% % % 0.2 % For the periods presented, interest income primarily consists of interest earned on invested cash balances and marketable securities. The increase to interest income in 2018 as compared to 2017 was primarily the result of increased cash, cash equivalents and marketable securities balances as a result of our May 2018 issuance of $1,150.0 million in par value of convertible senior notes due 2025. Interest expense is related to our debt transactions, which are described in Note 11 to the consolidated financial statements included elsewhere in this annual report on Form 10-K. The increase to interest expense for 2018 as compared to 2017 was primarily due to the May 2018 issuance of $1,150.0 million in par value of convertible senior notes due 2025, which bear regular interest of 0.125%, but have an effective interest rate of 4.26% due to the conversion feature. Other (expense) income, net for the years ended December 31, 2018 , 2017 and 2016 primarily represents net foreign exchange gains and losses mainly due to foreign currency exchange rate fluctuations on intercompany and other non-functional currency transactions. Other (expense) income, net may fluctuate in the future based on changes in foreign currency exchange rates or other events. Other (expense) income, net also includes gains and losses from certain equity investments. Provision for Income Taxes For the Years Ended December 31, For the Years Ended December 31, (in thousands) 2018 2017 % Change 2017 2016 % Change Provision for income taxes $ 44,716 $ 91,426 (51.1 )% $ 91,426 $ 145,635 (37.2 )% As a percentage of revenue 1.6 % 3.7 % 3.7 % 6.2 % Effective income tax rate 13.0 % 29.1 % 29.1 % 31.2 % For the year ended December 31, 2018, our effective income tax rate was lower than the federal statutory tax rate due to foreign income taxed at lower rates, the effects of stock-based compensation in accordance with authoritative guidance for share-based payments, a decrease in the provisional amount of the one-time transition tax that was recorded in 2017, the release of certain tax reserves related to the expiration of local statutes and the benefit of U.S. federal, state and foreign research and development credits. These benefits were partially offset by an intercompany sale of intellectual property and state income taxes. For the year ended December 31, 2017, our effective income tax rate was lower than the federal statutory tax rate due to the composition of income from foreign jurisdictions that is taxed at lower rates compared to the statutory tax rates in the U.S., the re-measurement of deferred taxes at lower tax rates expected to be in place upon realization due to the U.S. Tax Cuts and Jobs Act, or TCJA, which was enacted in December 2017, the impacts of the release of the acquisition-related reserve due to the expiration of the relevant statute of limitations and U.S. federal, state and foreign research and development credits. These benefits were partially offset by a provisional charge for the one-time transition tax on the mandatory deemed repatriation of cumulative foreign earnings taken as part of the TCJA, the effects of stock-based compensation in accordance with authoritative guidance for share-based payments and state income taxes. For the year ended December 31, 2017, the net impact of the TCJA described above was a provisional net tax expense of $26.0 million which is comprised of a one-time transition tax expense of $43.4 million on the mandatory deemed repatriation of cumulative foreign earnings as of December 31, 2017, offset by a $17.4 million tax benefit related to the re-measurement of deferred tax assets and liabilities due to the lower corporate income tax rate. As of December 31, 2018, we have finalized the 30 Table of Contents accounting for all of the tax effects of the TCJA and recorded a reduction of the transition tax expense of $5.5 million and an increase to the tax benefit related to the re-measurement of deferred tax assets and liabilities of $2.4 million. For the year ended December 31, 2016, our effective income tax rate was lower than the federal statutory tax rate due to the composition of income from foreign jurisdictions that is taxed at lower rates compared to the statutory tax rates in the U.S., the domestic production activities deduction and U.S. federal, state and foreign research and development credits, partially offset by the effects of stock-based compensation in accordance with authoritative guidance for share-based payments and state income taxes. The decrease in the provision for income taxes for 2018 as compared to 2017 was mainly due to the reduction in the U.S. federal statutory tax rate from 35.0% to 21.0% as part of the TCJA that was enacted in December 2017, an increase in the excess tax benefit related to stock-based compensation and the net impact of the TCJA recorded in 2017. These amounts were partially offset by an intercompany sale of intellectual property and an increase in non-deductible executive compensation. The decrease in the provision for income taxes for 2017 as compared to 2016 was mainly due to a decrease in profit before tax, the re-measurement of deferred taxes at lower tax rates expected to be in place upon realization as a result of the TCJA, the impacts of the release of an acquisition-related reserve due to the expiration of the relevant statute of limitations and an increase in U.S. federal, state and foreign research and development credits. These benefits were partially offset by a decrease in the domestic production activities deduction and a provisional charge for the one-time transition tax on the mandatory deemed repatriation of cumulative foreign earnings as a result of the TCJA. Our effective income tax rate may fluctuate between fiscal years and from quarter to quarter due to items arising from discrete events, such as tax benefits from the disposition of employee equity awards, tax law changes and settlements of tax audits and assessments. Our effective income tax rate is also impacted by, and may fluctuate in any given period because of, the composition of income in foreign jurisdictions where tax rates differ depending on the local statutory rates. Refer to Note 18 to the consolidated financial statements included elsewhere in this annual report on Form 10-K for additional information regarding unrecognized tax benefits that, if recognized, would impact the effective income tax rate in the next 12 months and for the potential impact that current litigation related to an adverse audit finding could have on our results of operations. Non-GAAP Financial Measures In addition to providing financial measurements based on accounting principles generally accepted in the U.S., or GAAP, we publicly discuss additional financial measures that are not prepared in accordance with GAAP, or non-GAAP financial measures. Management uses non-GAAP financial measures, in addition to GAAP financial measures, to understand and compare operating results across accounting periods, for financial and operational decision-making, for planning and forecasting purposes, to set executive compensation and to evaluate our financial performance. These non-GAAP financial measures are: non-GAAP income from operations, non-GAAP operating margin, non-GAAP net income, non-GAAP net income per diluted share, Adjusted EBITDA, Adjusted EBITDA margin and impact of foreign currency exchange rates, as discussed below. Management believes that these non-GAAP financial measures reflect our ongoing business in a manner that facilitates meaningful comparisons and analysis of trends in the business, as they assist in the comparison of financial results across accounting periods and to those of our peer companies. Management also believes that these non-GAAP financial measures enable investors to evaluate our operating results and future prospects in the same manner as management. These non-GAAP financial measures may exclude expenses and gains that may be unusual in nature, infrequent or not reflective of our ongoing operating results. The non-GAAP financial measures do not replace the presentation of our GAAP financial measures and should only be used as a supplement to, not as a substitute for, our financial results presented in accordance with GAAP. 31 Table of Contents The non-GAAP adjustments, and our basis for excluding them from non-GAAP financial measures, are outlined below: Amortization of acquired intangible assets We have incurred amortization of intangible assets, included in our GAAP financial statements, related to various acquisitions we have made. The amount of an acquisition's purchase price allocated to intangible assets and term of its related amortization can vary significantly and are unique to each acquisition; therefore, we exclude amortization of acquired intangible assets from our non-GAAP financial measures to provide investors with a consistent basis for comparing pre- and post-acquisition operating results. Stock-based compensation and amortization of capitalized stock-based compensation Although stock-based compensation is an important aspect of the compensation paid to our employees, the grant date fair value varies based on the stock price at the time of grant, varying valuation methodologies, subjective assumptions and the variety of award types. This makes the comparison of our current financial results to previous and future periods difficult to evaluate; therefore, we believe it is useful to exclude stock-based compensation and amortization of capitalized stock-based compensation from our non-GAAP financial measures in order to highlight the performance of our core business and to be consistent with the way many investors evaluate our performance and compare our operating results to peer companies. Acquisition-related costs Acquisition-related costs include transaction fees, advisory fees, due diligence costs and other direct costs associated with strategic activities. In addition, subsequent adjustments to our initial estimated amounts of contingent consideration and indemnification associated with specific acquisitions are included within acquisition-related costs. These amounts are impacted by the timing and size of the acquisitions. We exclude acquisition-related costs from our non-GAAP financial measures to provide a useful comparison of our operating results to prior periods and to our peer companies because such amounts vary significantly based on the magnitude of our acquisition transactions and do not reflect our core operations. Restructuring charges We have incurred restructuring charges that are included in our GAAP financial statements, primarily related to workforce reductions and estimated costs of exiting facility lease commitments. We exclude these items from our non-GAAP financial measures when evaluating our continuing business performance as such items vary significantly based on the magnitude of the restructuring action and do not reflect expected future operating expenses. In addition, these charges do not necessarily provide meaningful insight into the fundamentals of current or historical operations of our business. Amortization of debt discount and issuance costs and amortization of capitalized interest expense In May 2018, we issued $1,150 million of convertible senior notes due 2025 with a coupon interest rate of 0.125%. In February 2014, we issued $690 million of convertible senior notes due 2019 with a coupon interest rate of 0%. The imputed interest rates of these convertible senior notes were 4.26% and 3.20%, respectively. This is a result of the debt discounts recorded for the conversion features that are required to be separately accounted for as equity under GAAP, thereby reducing the carrying values of the convertible debt instruments. The debt discounts are amortized as interest expense together with the issuance costs of the debt. The interest expense excluded from our non-GAAP results is comprised of these non-cash components and is excluded from management's assessment of our operating performance because management believes the non-cash expense is not representative of ongoing operating performance. Gains and losses on investments We have recorded gains and losses from the disposition, changes to fair value and impairment of certain investments. We believe excluding these amounts from our non-GAAP financial measures is useful to investors as the types of events giving rise to them are not representative of our core business operations and ongoing operating performance. 32 Table of Contents Legal and stockholder matter costs We have incurred losses related to the settlement of legal matters, costs from professional service providers related to a non-routine stockholder matter and costs with respect to an internal U.S. Foreign Corrupt Practices Act, or FCPA, investigation. We believe excluding these amounts from our non-GAAP financial measures is useful to investors as the types of events giving rise to them are not representative of our core business operations. Endowment of Akamai Foundation During the second quarter of 2018, we incurred a charge to endow the Akamai Foundation. We believe excluding these amounts from non-GAAP financial measures is useful to investors as this one-time event is not representative of our core business operations. Transformation costs We have incurred professional services fees associated with internal transformation programs designed to improve operating margins and that are part of a planned program intended to significantly change the manner in which business is conducted. We believe excluding these amounts from our non-GAAP financial measures is useful to investors as the types of events and activities giving rise to them occur infrequently and are not representative of our core business operations and ongoing operating performance. Income tax effect of non-GAAP adjustments and certain discrete tax items The non-GAAP adjustments described above are reported on a pre-tax basis. The income tax effect of non-GAAP adjustments is the difference between GAAP and non-GAAP income tax expense. Non-GAAP income tax expense is computed on non-GAAP pre-tax income (GAAP pre-tax income adjusted for non-GAAP adjustments) and excludes certain discrete tax items (such as recording or releasing of valuation allowances), if any. We believe that applying the non-GAAP adjustments and their related income tax effect allows us to highlight income attributable to our core operations. The following table reconciles GAAP income from operations to non-GAAP income from operations and non-GAAP operating margin for the years ended December 31, 2018, 2017 and 2016 (in thousands): 2018 2017 2016 Income from operations $ 362,499 $ 314,289 $ 466,510 Amortization of acquired intangible assets 33,311 30,904 26,642 Stock-based compensation 183,813 164,308 144,506 Amortization of capitalized stock-based compensation and capitalized interest expense 28,603 19,953 15,439 Restructuring charge 27,594 54,884 10,301 Acquisition-related costs 2,868 23,374 1,064 Legal and stockholder matter costs 23,091 890 Endowment of Akamai Foundation 50,000 Transformation costs 7,730 Non-GAAP income from operations $ 719,509 $ 607,712 $ 665,352 GAAP operating margin 13 % 13 % 20 % Non-GAAP operating margin 27 % 24 % 28 % 33 Table of Contents The following table reconciles GAAP net income to non-GAAP net income for the years ended December 31, 2018, 2017 and 2016 (in thousands): 2018 2017 2016 Net income $ 298,373 $ 222,766 $ 320,727 Amortization of acquired intangible assets 33,311 30,904 26,642 Stock-based compensation 183,813 164,308 144,506 Amortization of capitalized stock-based compensation and capitalized interest expense 28,603 19,953 15,439 Restructuring charge 27,594 54,884 10,301 Acquisition-related costs 2,868 23,374 1,064 Legal and stockholder matter costs 23,091 890 Endowment of Akamai Foundation 50,000 Transformation costs 7,730 Amortization of debt discount and issuance costs 41,958 18,839 18,638 Loss (gain) on investments 1,481 (450 ) (4,807 ) Income tax effect of above non-GAAP adjustments and certain discrete tax items (86,391 ) (82,817 ) (52,661 ) Non-GAAP net income $ 612,431 $ 451,761 $ 480,739 The following table reconciles GAAP net income per diluted share to non-GAAP net income per diluted share for the years ended December 31, 2018, 2017 and 2016 (shares in thousands): 2018 2017 2016 GAAP net income per diluted share $ 1.76 $ 1.29 $ 1.82 Amortization of acquired intangible assets 0.20 0.18 0.15 Stock-based compensation 1.09 0.95 0.82 Amortization of capitalized stock-based compensation and capitalized interest expense 0.17 0.12 0.09 Restructuring charge 0.16 0.32 0.06 Acquisition-related costs 0.02 0.14 0.01 Legal and stockholder matter costs 0.14 0.01 Endowment of Akamai Foundation 0.30 Transformation costs 0.05 Amortization of debt discount and issuance costs 0.25 0.11 0.11 Loss (gain) on investments 0.01 (0.03 ) Income tax effect of above non-GAAP adjustments and certain discrete tax items (0.51 ) (0.48 ) (0.30 ) Non-GAAP net income per diluted share (1) $ 3.62 $ 2.62 $ 2.73 Shares used in per share calculations 169,188 172,711 176,215 (1) May not foot due to rounding Non-GAAP net income per diluted share is calculated as non-GAAP net income divided by diluted weighted average common shares outstanding. GAAP diluted weighted average common shares outstanding are adjusted in non-GAAP per share calculations for the shares that would be delivered to us pursuant to the note hedge transactions entered into in connection with the issuance of our convertible senior notes. Under GAAP, shares delivered under hedge transactions are not considered offsetting shares in the fully-diluted share calculation until they are delivered. However, we would receive a benefit from the note hedge transactions and would not allow the dilution to occur, so management believes that adjusting for this benefit provides a meaningful view of net income per share. Unless and until our weighted average stock price is greater than $89.56 (the initial conversion price of the convertible senior notes due 2019), and unless or until our weighted average stock price is greater than $95.10, the initial conversion price of the convertible senior notes due 2025, there will be no difference between our GAAP and non-GAAP diluted weighted average common shares outstanding. 34 Table of Contents We consider Adjusted EBITDA to be another important indicator of the operational strength and performance of our business and a good measure of our historical operating trends. Adjusted EBITDA eliminates items that we do not consider to be part of our core operations. We define Adjusted EBITDA as GAAP net income excluding the following items: interest income; income taxes; depreciation and amortization of tangible and intangible assets; stock-based compensation; amortization of capitalized stock-based compensation; acquisition-related costs; restructuring charges; gains and other activity related to divestiture of a business; gains and losses on legal settlements; costs incurred with respect to our internal FCPA investigation; foreign exchange gains and losses; loss on early extinguishment of debt; amortization of debt discount and issuance costs; amortization of capitalized interest expense; certain gains and losses on investments; and other non-recurring or unusual items that may arise from time to time. Adjusted EBITDA margin represents Adjusted EBITDA stated as a percentage of revenue. The following table reconciles GAAP net income to Adjusted EBITDA and Adjusted EBITDA margin for the years ended December 31, 2018, 2017 and 2016 (in thousands): 2018 2017 2016 Net income $ 298,373 $ 222,766 $ 320,727 Amortization of acquired intangible assets 33,311 30,904 26,642 Stock-based compensation 183,813 164,308 144,506 Amortization of capitalized stock-based compensation and capitalized interest expense 28,603 19,953 15,439 Restructuring charge 27,594 54,884 10,301 Acquisition-related costs 2,868 23,374 1,064 Legal and stockholder matter costs 23,091 890 Interest income (26,940 ) (17,855 ) (14,702 ) Endowment of Akamai Foundation 50,000 Transformation costs 7,730 Amortization of debt discount and issuance costs 43,202 18,839 18,638 Provision for income taxes 44,716 91,426 145,635 Depreciation and amortization 372,606 321,456 292,221 Loss (gain) on investments 1,481 (450 ) (4,807 ) Other expense (income), net 1,667 (437 ) 1,019 Adjusted EBITDA $ 1,092,115 $ 929,168 $ 957,573 Adjusted EBITDA margin 40 % 37 % 41 % Impact of Foreign Currency Exchange Rates Revenue and earnings from our international operations have historically been an important contributor to our financial results. Consequently, our financial results have been impacted, and management expects they will continue to be impacted, by fluctuations in foreign currency exchange rates. For example, when the local currencies of our foreign subsidiaries weaken, generally our consolidated results stated in U.S. dollars are negatively impacted. Because exchange rates are a meaningful factor in understanding period-to-period comparisons, management believes the presentation of the impact of foreign currency exchange rates on revenue and earnings enhances the understanding of our financial results and evaluation of performance in comparison to prior periods. The dollar impact of changes in foreign currency exchange rates presented is calculated by translating current period results using monthly average foreign currency exchange rates from the comparative period and comparing them to the reported amount. The percentage change at constant currency presented is calculated by comparing the prior period amounts as reported and the current period amounts translated using the same monthly average foreign currency exchange rates from the comparative period. 35 Table of Contents Liquidity and Capital Resources To date, we have financed our operations primarily through public and private sales of debt and equity securities and cash generated by operations. As of December 31, 2018 , our cash, cash equivalents and marketable securities, which primarily consisted of commercial paper and corporate bonds, totaled $2.1 billion . Factoring in our convertible senior notes of $1.8 billion, our net cash at December 31, 2018 was $261.2 million. We place our cash investments in instruments that meet high-quality credit standards, as specified in our investment policy. Our investment policy also limits the amount of our credit exposure to any one issue or issuer and seeks to manage these assets to achieve our goals of preserving principal and maintaining adequate liquidity at all times. Changes in cash, cash equivalents and marketable securities are dependent upon changes in, among other things, working capital items such as accounts receivable, deferred revenues, accounts payable and various accrued expenses, as well as changes in our capital and financial structure due to common stock repurchases, debt repurchases and issuances, purchases and sales of marketable securities and similar events. We believe our strong balance sheet and cash position are important competitive differentiators that provide the financial flexibility necessary to make investments at opportune times. We expect to continue to evaluate strategic investments to strengthen our business. As of December 31, 2018 , we had cash and cash equivalents of $351.7 million held in accounts outside the U.S. As a result of the TCJA, we have recorded a tax expense of $39.4 million related to the one-time transition tax on the mandatory deemed repatriation of cumulative foreign earnings as of December 31, 2018 . We made an election to pay the transition tax in installments over an eight-year period. We have sufficient cash in the U.S. to pay this tax obligation and do not need to rely on cash outside the U.S. for payment. The TCJA also provides for a territorial tax system in the U.S., which may provide companies with the ability to repatriate earnings with minimal U.S. federal income tax impact. As a result, our liquidity is not materially impacted by the amount of cash and cash equivalents held in accounts outside the U.S. For additional information, including information on the impact of the TCJA, see Note 18 to the consolidated financial statements included elsewhere in this annual report on Form 10-K. Cash Provided by Operating Activities For the Years Ended December 31, (in thousands) 2018 2017 2016 Net income $ 298,373 $ 222,766 $ 320,727 Non-cash reconciling items included in net income 679,648 590,249 517,649 Changes in operating assets and liabilities 30,306 (12,032 ) 33,436 Net cash flows provided by operating activities $ 1,008,327 $ 800,983 $ 871,812 The increase in cash provided by operating activities for 2018 as compared to 2017 was primarily due to increased profitability in 2018, lower cash paid for income taxes due to a lower U.S federal statutory tax rate due to the TCJA during 2018 and the timing of collections and payments of other working capital items. The increase in cash provided by operating activities for the 2018 as compared to 2017 was partially offset by a one-time contribution to the Akamai Foundation of $50.0 million, as well as higher annual bonus payouts in the first quarter of 2018 due to increased headcount from hiring in 2017. The decrease in cash provided by operating activities for 2017 as compared to 2016 was primarily due to lower profitability as a result of the restructuring charge in 2017 and higher expenses as a result of our 2017 acquisitions. Payroll and related costs, including annual bonus and commissions payouts, were higher in 2017 as compared to 2016 due to increased headcount and higher bonus and commission attainment levels. 36 Table of Contents Cash Used in Investing Activities For the Years Ended December 31, (in thousands) 2018 2017 2016 Cash paid for acquired businesses, net of cash acquired $ (79 ) $ (369,073 ) $ (95,439 ) Purchases of property and equipment and capitalization of internal-use software development costs (405,741 ) (414,778 ) (316,289 ) Net marketable securities activity (98,647 ) 326,272 (58,484 ) Other investing activities (2,066 ) (1,586 ) 786 Net cash used in investing activities $ (506,533 ) $ (459,165 ) $ (469,426 ) The increase in cash used in investing activities in 2018 as compared to 2017 was driven by marketable securities activities. In 2017 we did not reinvest all proceeds from sales and maturities of our marketable securities which created a cash inflow in that year. The increase in cash used in investing activities in 2018 as compared to 2017 was partially offset by the cash paid in 2017 for the acquisitions of Nominum, Inc. and Soasta, Inc. The decrease in cash used in investing activities in 2017 as compared to 2016 was driven by a decrease in marketable securities activities. This was offset by the funding our 2017 acquisitions of Nominum and Soasta. We also increased our purchases of property and equipment in 2017 as compared to 2016 to support both network and facility expansion. Subsequent to December 31, 2018, we acquired Janrain, Inc., a provider of customer identity access management solutions, for $125.0 million. The all-cash transaction closed in January 2019. Cash Provided by (Used in) Financing Activities For the Years Ended December 31, (in thousands) 2018 2017 2016 Activity related to convertible senior notes $ 990,390 $ $ Activity related to stock-based compensation (1,697 ) (2,715 ) 14,015 Repurchases of common stock (750,000 ) (361,194 ) (373,794 ) Other financing activities (5,085 ) (1,096 ) Net cash provided by (used in) financing activities $ 233,608 $ (365,005 ) $ (359,779 ) The increase in cash provided by financing activities during 2018 as compared to 2017 was the result of our convertible senior notes issued in May 2018 and related note hedge and warrant transactions. The increase was partially offset by an increase in shares repurchased under our repurchase programs. The increase in cash used in financing activities during 2017 as compared to 2016 was primarily due to an increase in employee taxes paid related to net share settlement of stock-based awards. In October 2013, the Board of Directors authorized a $750.0 million share repurchase program, effective from October 2013 through December 2016. In February 2016, the Board of Directors authorized a $1.0 billion share repurchase program that superseded the October 2013 repurchase program and was effective from February 2016 through December 2018. In March 2018, the Company announced that its Board of Directors had increased its share repurchase authorization by $416.7 million , such that the amount that was authorized and available for repurchase in 2018 was $750.0 million . Subsequently, effective November 2018, the Board of Directors authorized an additional $1.1 billion repurchase program through December 2021. Our goal for the share repurchase programs are to offset the dilution created by its employee equity compensation programs and provide the flexibility to return capital to shareholders as business and market conditions warrant. During 2018 , 2017 and 2016 , we repurchased 10.2 million , 6.9 million and 7.0 million shares of our common stock, respectively, at an average price per share of $73.54 , $52.59 and $53.28 , respectively. These repurchases have contributed to a decrease to weighted average shares over at least the past three years. 37 Table of Contents Convertible Senior Notes In May 2018, we issued $1,150.0 million in par value of convertible senior notes due 2025 and entered into related convertible note hedge and warrant transactions. The terms of the notes, hedge and warrant transactions are discussed more fully in Note 11 to the consolidated financial statements included elsewhere in this annual report on Form 10-K. We used a portion of the net proceeds to repay at maturity all of our $690.0 million outstanding aggregate principle amount of convertible senior notes due in 2019. In addition, we intend to use the remaining net proceeds of the offering for share repurchases, working capital and general corporate purposes, including potential acquisitions and other strategic transactions. In February 2014, we issued $690.0 million in par value of convertible senior notes due 2019 and entered into related convertible note hedge and warrant transactions. The terms of the notes, hedge and warrant transactions are discussed more fully in Note 11 to the consolidated financial statements included elsewhere in this annual report on Form 10-K. The notes were classified as a current liability on our consolidated balance sheet as of December 31, 2018. We repaid the full $690.0 million in cash in February 2019, as the notes matured and no conversions occurred. Revolving Credit Facility In May 2018, we entered into a $500.0 million, five-year revolving credit agreement, or the Credit Agreement. Borrowings under the facility may be used to finance working capital needs and for general corporate purposes. The facility provides for an initial $500.0 million in revolving loans. Under specified circumstances, the facility can be increased to up to $1.0 billion in aggregate principal amount. Borrowings under the Credit Agreement bear interest, at our option, at a base rate plus a spread of 0.00% to 0.25% or an adjusted LIBOR rate plus a spread of 0.875% to 1.25%, in each case with such spread being determined based on our consolidated leverage ratio specified in the Credit Agreement. Regardless of what amounts, if any, are outstanding under the Credit Agreement, we are also obligated to pay an ongoing commitment fee on undrawn amounts at a rate of 0.075% to 0.15%, with such rate being based on our consolidated leverage ratio specified in the Credit Agreement. The Credit Agreement contains customary representations and warranties, affirmative and negative covenants, and events of default. Principal covenants include a maximum consolidated leverage ratio and a minimum consolidated interest coverage ratio. There were no outstanding borrowings under the Credit Agreement as of December 31, 2018 . Liquidity Outlook Based on our present business plan, we expect our current cash, cash equivalents and marketable securities balances and our forecasted cash flows from operations to be sufficient to meet our foreseeable cash needs for at least the next 12 months. Our foreseeable cash needs, in addition to our recurring operating costs, include our expected capital expenditures, investments in information technology and facility expansion, opportunistic business acquisitions, anticipated share repurchases, lease and purchase commitments, and settlements of other long-term liabilities. Contractual Obligations, Contingent Liabilities and Commercial Commitments The following table presents our contractual obligations and commercial commitments, as of December 31, 2018 , for the next five years and thereafter (in thousands): Payments Due by Period Total Less than 12 Months 12 to 36 Months 36 to 60 Months More than 60 Months Real estate operating leases $ 951,254 $ 54,561 $ 154,674 $ 142,681 $ 599,338 Bandwidth and co-location agreements 182,758 138,777 32,883 7,389 3,709 Open vendor purchase orders 178,692 156,533 21,691 468 Convertible senior notes 1,840,000 690,000 1,150,000 Total contractual obligations $ 3,152,704 $ 1,039,871 $ 209,248 $ 150,538 $ 1,753,047 In accordance with the authoritative guidance for accounting for uncertainty in income taxes, as of December 31, 2018 , we had unrecognized tax benefits of $ 67.8 million , including $ 11.8 million of accrued interest and penalties. We believe that it is 38 Table of Contents reasonably possible that $33.2 million of our unrecognized tax benefits will be recognized by the end of 2019. The settlement period for the remaining amount of the unrecognized tax benefits is unknown. Letters of Credit As of December 31, 2018 , we had outstanding $7.8 million in irrevocable letters of credit issued by us in favor of third party beneficiaries, primarily related to facility leases. These irrevocable letters of credit, which are not included in the table of contractual obligations above, are unsecured and are expected to remain in effect, in some cases, until 2026 . Off-Balance Sheet Arrangements We have entered into indemnification agreements with third parties, including vendors, customers, landlords, our officers and directors, shareholders of acquired companies, joint venture partners and third parties to which we license technology. Generally, these indemnification agreements require us to reimburse losses suffered by a third party due to various events, such as lawsuits arising from patent or copyright infringement or our negligence. These indemnification obligations are considered off-balance sheet arrangements in accordance with the authoritative guidance for guarantor accounting and disclosure requirements for guarantees, including indirect guarantees of indebtedness of others. See Note 12 to our consolidated financial statements included elsewhere in this annual report on Form 10-K for further discussion of these indemnification agreements. The fair value of guarantees issued or modified during 2018 and 2017 was determined to be immaterial. Legal Matters We are party to litigation that we consider routine and incidental to our business. We do not currently expect the results of any of these litigation matters to have a material effect on our business, results of operations, financial condition or cash flows. Significant Accounting Policies and Estimates See Note 2 to the consolidated financial statements included elsewhere in this annual report on Form 10-K for information regarding recent and newly adopted accounting pronouncements. Application of Critical Accounting Policies and Estimates Overview Our MD&A is based upon our consolidated financial statements, which have been prepared in accordance with GAAP. These principles require us to make estimates and judgments that affect the reported amounts of assets, liabilities, revenue and expenses, cash flow and related disclosure of contingent assets and liabilities. Our estimates include those related to revenue recognition, accounts receivable and related reserves, valuation and impairment of marketable securities, capitalized internal-use software development costs, goodwill and acquired intangible assets, income tax reserves, impairment and useful lives of long-lived assets and stock-based compensation. We base our estimates on historical experience and on various other assumptions that we believe to be reasonable under the circumstances at the time such estimates are made. Actual results may differ from these estimates. For a complete description of our significant accounting policies, see Note 2 to our consolidated financial statements included elsewhere in this annual report on Form 10-K. Definitions We define our critical accounting policies as those policies that require us to make subjective estimates and judgments about matters that are uncertain and are likely to have a material impact on our consolidated financial statements. Our estimates are based upon assumptions and judgments about matters that are highly uncertain at the time an accounting estimate is made and applied and require us to assess a range of potential outcomes. 39 Table of Contents Review of Critical Accounting Policies and Estimates Revenue Recognition Our contracts with customers sometimes include promises to transfer multiple services to a customer. Determining whether services are distinct performance obligations often requires the exercise of judgment by management. Advanced features that enhance a main product or service and are highly interrelated are generally not considered distinct; rather, they are combined with the service they relate to into one performance obligation. Different determinations related to combining services into performance obligations could result in differences in the timing and amount of revenue recognized in a period. Determination of the standalone selling price, or SSP, also requires the exercise of judgment by management. SSP is based on observable inputs such as the price we charge for the service when sold separately, or the discounted list price per management approved price list. In cases where services are not sold separately or price list rates are not available, a cost-plus-margin approach or adjusted market approach is used to determine SSP. Changes to SSP could result in differences in the allocation of transaction price among performance obligations, which could result in differences in the timing and amount of revenue recognized in a period. From time to time, we enter into contracts to sell services or license technology to unrelated enterprises at or about the same time that we enter into contracts to purchase products or services from the same enterprises. Consideration payable to a customer is reviewed as part of the transaction price. If the payment to the customer does not represent payment for a distinct service, revenue is recognized only up to the net amount of consideration after customer payment obligations are considered. Different determinations on whether a payment represents a distinct service could result in differences in the amount of revenue recognized. We may also resell the licenses or services of third parties. If we are acting as an agent in an arrangement with a customer to provide third party services, the transaction price reflects only the net amount to which we will be entitled, after accounting for payments made to the third party responsible for satisfying the performance obligation. Different determinations on whether we are acting as an agent or a principal could change the amount of revenue recognized. Accounts Receivable and Related Reserves Trade accounts receivable are recorded at the invoiced amounts and do not bear interest. In addition to trade accounts receivable, our accounts receivable balance includes unbilled accounts that represent revenue recorded for customers that is typically billed within one month. We record reserves against our accounts receivable balance. These reserves primarily consist of allowances for doubtful accounts. Increases and decreases in the allowance for doubtful accounts are included as a component of general and administrative expense in the consolidated statements of income. Estimates are used in determining our reserves and are based upon our review of outstanding balances on a customer-specific, account-by-account basis. The allowance for doubtful accounts is based upon a review of customer receivables from prior sales with collection issues where we no longer believe that the customer has the ability to pay for prior services provided. We perform ongoing credit evaluations of our customers. If such an evaluation indicates that payment is no longer reasonably assured for services provided, any future services provided to that customer will result in creation of a cash basis reserve until we receive consistent payments. Valuation and Impairment of Marketable Securities We measure the fair value of our financial assets and liabilities at the end of each reporting period. Fair value is defined as the exchange price that would be received for an asset or paid to transfer a liability (an exit price) in the principal or most advantageous market for the asset or liability in an orderly transaction between market participants on the measurement date. We have certain financial assets and liabilities recorded at fair value (principally cash equivalents and short- and long-term marketable securities) that have been classified as Level 1, 2 or 3 within the fair value hierarchy. Fair values determined by Level 1 inputs utilize quoted prices (unadjusted) in active markets for identical assets or liabilities that we can access at the reporting date. Fair values determined by Level 2 inputs utilize data points other than quoted prices included within Level 1 that are observable for the asset or liability, either directly or indirectly. Fair values determined by Level 3 inputs are based on unobservable data points for the asset or liability. Marketable securities are considered to be impaired when a decline in fair value below cost basis is determined to be other-than-temporary. We periodically evaluate whether a decline in fair value below cost basis is other-than-temporary by considering available evidence regarding these investments including, among other factors, the duration of the period that, and 40 Table of Contents extent to which, the fair value is less than cost basis; the financial health of, and business outlook for, the issuer, including industry and sector performance and operational and financing cash flow factors; overall market conditions and trends; and our intent and ability to retain our investment in the security for a period of time sufficient to allow for an anticipated recovery in market value. Once a decline in fair value is determined to be other-than-temporary, a write-down is recorded and a new cost basis in the security is established. Assessing the above factors involves inherent uncertainty. Write-downs, if recorded, could be materially different from the actual market performance of marketable securities in our portfolio if, among other things, relevant information related to our investments and marketable securities was not publicly available or other factors not considered by us would have been relevant to the determination of impairment. Impairment and Useful Lives of Long-Lived Assets We review our long-lived assets, such as property and equipment and acquired intangible assets, for impairment whenever events or changes in circumstances indicate that the carrying amount of the assets may not be recoverable. Events that would trigger an impairment review include a change in the use of the asset or forecasted negative cash flows related to the asset. When such events occur, we compare the carrying amount of the asset to the undiscounted expected future cash flows related to the asset. If this comparison indicates that impairment is present, the amount of the impairment is calculated as the difference between the carrying amount and the fair value of the asset. If a readily determinable market price does not exist, fair value is estimated using discounted expected cash flows attributable to the asset. The estimates required to apply this accounting policy include forecasted usage of the long-lived assets, the useful lives of these assets and expected future cash flows. Changes in these estimates could materially impact results from operations. Goodwill and Acquired Intangible Assets We test goodwill for impairment on an annual basis, as of December 31, or more frequently if events or changes in circumstances indicate that the asset might be impaired. We have concluded that we have one reporting unit and that our chief operating decision maker is our chief executive officer and the executive management team. We have assigned the entire balance of goodwill to our one reporting unit. The fair value of the reporting unit was based on our market capitalization as of each of December 31, 2018 and 2017 , and it was substantially in excess of the carrying value of the reporting unit at each date. Acquired intangible assets consist of completed technologies, customer relationships, trademarks and trade names, non-compete agreements and acquired license rights. We engaged third party valuation specialists to assist us with the initial measurement of the fair value of acquired intangible assets. Acquired intangible assets, other than goodwill, are amortized over their estimated useful lives based upon the estimated economic value derived from the related intangible assets. Income Taxes Our provision for income taxes is comprised of a current and a deferred portion. The current income tax provision is calculated as the estimated taxes payable or refundable on tax returns for the current year. The deferred income tax provision is calculated for the estimated future tax effects attributable to temporary differences and carryforwards by using expected tax rates in effect in the years during which the differences are expected to reverse or the carryforwards are expected to be realized. We currently have net deferred tax assets, comprised of net operating loss, or NOL, carryforwards, tax credit carryforwards and deductible temporary differences. Our management periodically weighs the positive and negative evidence to determine if it is more likely than not that some or all of the deferred tax assets will be realized. In determining our net deferred tax assets and valuation allowances, annualized effective tax rates and cash paid for income taxes, management is required to make judgments and estimates about domestic and foreign profitability, the timing and extent of the utilization of NOL carryforwards, applicable tax rates, transfer pricing methodologies and tax planning strategies. Judgments and estimates related to our projections and assumptions are inherently uncertain; therefore, actual results could differ materially from our projections. We have recorded certain tax reserves to address potential exposures involving our income tax positions. These potential tax liabilities result from the varying application of statutes, rules, regulations and interpretations by different taxing jurisdictions. Our estimate of the value of our tax reserves contains assumptions based on past experiences and judgments about the interpretation of statutes, rules and regulations by taxing jurisdictions. It is possible that the costs of the ultimate tax liability or benefit from these matters may be more or less than the amount that we estimated. Uncertainty in income taxes is recognized in our consolidated financial statements using a two-step process to determine the amount of tax benefit to be recognized. First, the tax position must be evaluated to determine the likelihood that it will be sustained upon external examination. If the tax position is deemed more-likely-than-not to be sustained based on technical 41 Table of Contents merit, the tax position is then assessed to determine the amount of benefit to recognize in the financial statements. The amount of the benefit that may be recognized is the largest amount that we believe has a greater than 50% likelihood of being realized upon ultimate settlement. Accounting for Stock-Based Compensation We issue stock-based compensation awards including stock options, restricted stock units and deferred stock units. We measure the fair value of these awards at the grant date and recognize such fair value as expense over the vesting period. We have selected the Black-Scholes option pricing model to determine the fair value of stock option awards and the Monte Carlo simulation model to determine the fair value of market-based restricted stock unit awards. Determining the fair value of stock-based awards at the grant date requires judgment, including estimating the expected life of the stock awards and the volatility of the underlying common stock. Our assumptions may differ from those used in prior periods. Changes to the assumptions may have a significant impact on the fair value of stock-based awards, which could have a material impact on our financial statements. Judgment is also required in estimating the number of stock-based awards that are expected to be forfeited. Should our actual forfeiture rates differ significantly from our estimates, our stock-based compensation expense and results of operations could be materially impacted. In addition, for awards that vest and become exercisable only upon achievement of specified performance conditions, we make judgments and estimates each quarter about the probability that such performance conditions will be met or achieved. Changes to the estimates we make from time to time may have a significant impact on our stock-based compensation expense and could materially impact our result of operations. Capitalized Internal-Use Software Costs We capitalize salaries and related costs, including stock-based compensation, of employees and consultants who devote time to the development of internal-use software development projects, as well as interest expense related to our senior convertible notes. Capitalization begins during the application development stage, once the preliminary project stage has been completed. If a project constitutes an enhancement to previously-developed software, we assess whether the enhancement creates additional functionality to the software, thus qualifying the work incurred for capitalization. Once the project is available for general release, capitalization ceases and we estimate the useful life of the asset and begin amortization. We periodically assess whether triggering events are present to review internal-use software for impairment. Changes in our estimates related to internal-use software would increase or decrease operating expenses or amortization recorded during the period.
