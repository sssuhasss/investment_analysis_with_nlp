Item 7. Management's Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations The following discussion and analysis should be read in conjunction with our consolidated financial statements and related combined notes included in this Annual Report on Form 10-K. References in this Annual Report to "NU," the "Company," "we," "us," and "our" refer to Northeast Utilities and its consolidated subsidiaries. All per share amounts are reported on a diluted basis. The consolidated financial statements of NU, NSTAR Electric and PSNH and the financial statements of CL&P and WMECO are herein collectively referred to as the "financial statements." Refer to the Glossary of Terms included in this Annual Report on Form 10-K for abbreviations and acronyms used throughout this Management's Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations . The only common equity securities that are publicly traded are common shares of NU. The earnings and EPS of each business discussed below do not represent a direct legal interest in the assets and liabilities allocated to such business but rather represent a direct interest in our assets and liabilities as a whole. EPS by business is a financial measure not recognized under GAAP that is calculated by dividing the Net Income Attributable to Controlling Interest of each business by the weighted average diluted NU common shares outstanding for the year. The discussion below also includes non-GAAP financial measures referencing our 2013, 2012 and 2011 earnings and EPS excluding certain integration and merger costs related to NU's merger with NSTAR and a 2011 non-recurring charge at CL&P for the establishment of a reserve to provide bill credits to its residential customers and donations to charitable organizations. We use these non-GAAP financial measures to evaluate and to provide details of earnings by business and to more fully compare and explain our 2013, 2012 and 2011 results without including the impact of these non-recurring items. Due to the nature and significance of these items on Net Income Attributable to Controlling Interest, we believe that the non-GAAP presentation is more representative of our financial performance and provides additional and useful information to readers of this report in analyzing historical and future performance by business. These non-GAAP financial measures should not be considered as an alternative to reported Net Income Attributable to Controlling Interest or EPS determined in accordance with GAAP as an indicator of operating performance. Reconciliations of the above non-GAAP financial measures to the most directly comparable GAAP measures of consolidated diluted EPS and Net Income Attributable to Controlling Interest are included under "Financial Condition and Business Analysis Overview Consolidated" in Management's Discussion and Analysis , herein. Financial Condition and Business Analysis Merger with NSTAR: On April 10, 2012, we completed our merger with NSTAR. Unless otherwise noted, the results of NSTAR and its subsidiaries, hereinafter referred to as "NSTAR," are included in NU financial position, results of operations and cash flows as of December 31, 2013 and 2012, for the full year ended December 31, 2013, and for the period beginning April 10, 2012 through December 31, 2012 throughout this Management's Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations . Executive Summary The following items in this executive summary are explained in more detail in this Annual Report: Results: We earned $786 million, or $2.49 per share, in 2013, compared with $525.9 million, or $1.89 per share, in 2012. Excluding after-tax integration and merger-related costs of $13.8 million, or $0.04 per share, in 2013 and $107.6 million, or $0.39 per share, in 2012, we earned $799.8 million, or $2.53 per share, in 2013 and $633.5 million, or $2.28 per share, in 2012. Our electric distribution segment, which includes generation, earned $427 million, or $1.35 per share, in 2013, compared with $292.3 million, or $1.04 per share, in 2012. The 2012 results include $51.1 million, or $0.19 per share, of after-tax merger settlement agreement costs. Our transmission segment earned $287 million, or $0.91 per share, in 2013, compared with $249.7 million, or $0.90 per share, in 2012. Our natural gas distribution segment earned $60.9 million, or $0.19 per share, in 2013, compared with $30.8 million, or $0.11 per share, in 2012. The 2012 results include $2.1 million, or $0.01 per share, of after-tax merger settlement agreement costs. NU parent and other companies recorded earnings of $11.1 million, or $0.04 per share, in 2013, compared with net losses of $46.9 million, or $0.16 per share, in 2012. The 2013 and 2012 results include $13.8 million, or $0.04 per share, and $54.4 million, or $0.19 per share, respectively, of after-tax integration and merger-related costs. We project to make capital expenditures of approximately $7.6 billion from 2014 through 2017. Of the $7.6 billion, we expect to invest approximately $3.5 billion in our electric and natural gas distribution segments and $3.7 billion in our electric transmission segment. In addition, we project to invest approximately $400 million for our corporate service companies. 32 Legislative, Regulatory, Policy and Other Items: In 2013, CL&P and NSTAR Electric filed a request with the PURA and DPU, respectively, seeking approval to recover storm restoration costs. On December 30, 2013, the DPU approved recovery of NSTAR Electric $34.2 million in storm restoration costs. On February 3, 2014, the PURA issued a draft decision, approving recovery of CL&P $365 million in storm restoration costs. In 2013, Connecticut enacted into law two significant energy bills. The first law implemented a number of the recommendations proposed in the Connecticut comprehensive energy strategy (CES), including the expansion of natural gas service, and required PURA to implement decoupling for each of Connecticut electric and natural gas utilities in their next respective rate cases. The second law allows DEEP to conduct a process that will ultimately help Connecticut meet its Renewable Portfolio Standard by authorizing the state electric distribution companies to enter into long-term power purchase agreements. On November 22, 2013, the PURA issued a final decision approving a comprehensive joint natural gas infrastructure expansion plan (expansion plan), consistent with the goals of the CES, that was filed in June 2013 by Yankee Gas and other Connecticut natural gas distribution companies. The expansion plan described how Yankee Gas expects to add approximately 82,000 new natural gas heating customers over the next 10 years. On July 1, 2013, NPT filed an amendment to the Department of Energy (DOE) Presidential Permit Application for a proposed improved route in the northernmost section of the project area. The DOE completed its public scoping meeting process and the majority of its seasonal field work and environmental data collection. On December 11, 2013, NPT filed an amendment to the Transmission Services Agreement (TSA) with FERC, which was accepted on January 13, 2014. On December 31, 2013, NPT received ISO-NE approval under Section I.3.9 of the ISO tariff. On August 6, 2013, the FERC ALJ issued an initial decision regarding the September 2011 joint complaint filed with the FERC by various New England parties concerning the base ROE earned by New England transmission owners (NETOs). The initial decision found that the current base ROE is not reasonable, but leaves policy considerations and additional adjustments to the FERC, and determined that a separate base ROE of 10.6 percent and 9.7 percent should be set for the refund period (October 1, 2011 through December 31, 2012) and the prospective period (beginning when FERC issues its final decision), respectively. The FERC may adjust the prospective period base ROE in its final decision, expected in 2014, to reflect movement in the capital markets from when the case was filed in April 2013. As a result, in 2013, we recorded a reserve and recognized an after-tax charge of $14.3 million for the potential financial impact from the FERC ALJ's initial decision. On November 20, 2013, GSRP, the first, largest and most complicated project within the NEEWS family of projects was fully energized. The project was fully energized ahead of schedule with a final cost of $676 million, $42 million under the $718 million estimated cost. Liquidity: Cash and cash equivalents totaled $43.4 million as of December 31, 2013, compared with $45.7 million as of December 31, 2012, while investments in property, plant and equipment totaled $1.5 billion in both 2013 and 2012. Cash flows provided by operating activities in 2013 totaled $1.58 billion, compared with operating cash flows of $1.05 billion in 2012 (amounts are net of RRB payments). The improved cash flows were due primarily to the addition of NSTAR, a decrease in storm restoration costs, and the absence in 2013 of customer bill credits and merger-related costs paid in 2012, partially offset by an increase in Pension Plan cash contributions. In 2013, we issued $1.68 billion of new long-term debt consisting of $750 million by NU parent, $400 million by CL&P, $200 million by NSTAR Electric, $250 million by PSNH, and $80 million by WMECO. These new issuances were used primarily to repay approximately $928 million of existing long-term debt and PCRBs. On January 2, 2014, Yankee Gas issued $100 million of new long-term debt. As of December 31, 2013, approximately $502 million of NU's current liabilities relate to long-term debt that will be paid in the next 12 months. On February 4, 2014, our Board of Trustees approved a common dividend payment of $0.3925 per share, payable on March 31, 2014 to shareholders of record as of March 3, 2014. The dividend represented an increase of 6.8 percent over the quarterly dividend paid in December 2013. 33 Overview Consolidated: A summary of our earnings by business, which also reconciles the non-GAAP financial measures of consolidated non-GAAP earnings and EPS, as well as EPS by business, to the most directly comparable GAAP measures of consolidated Net Income Attributable to Controlling Interest and diluted EPS, for 2013, 2012 and 2011 is as follows: For the Years Ended December 31, (Millions of Dollars, Except Per Share Amounts) 2013 2012 (1) 2011 Amount Per Share Amount Per Share Amount Per Share Net Income Attributable to Controlling Interest (GAAP) $ 786.0 $ 2.49 $ 525.9 $ 1.89 $ 394.7 $ 2.22 Regulated Companies $ 774.9 $ 2.45 $ 626.0 $ 2.25 $ 438.3 $ 2.46 NU Parent and Other Companies 24.9 0.08 7.5 0.03 (14.4) (0.08) Non-GAAP Earnings 799.8 2.53 633.5 2.28 423.9 2.38 Integration and Merger-Related Costs (after-tax) (13.8) (0.04) (107.6) (0.39) (11.3) (0.06) Storm Fund Reserve - - - - (17.9) (0.10) Net Income Attributable to Controlling Interest (GAAP) $ 786.0 $ 2.49 $ 525.9 $ 1.89 $ 394.7 $ 2.22 (1) Results include the operations of NSTAR beginning April 10, 2012. The 2013 after-tax integration-related costs consisted of costs incurred for employee severance in connection with ongoing integration, and consulting and retention costs. The 2012 after-tax merger-related costs consisted of Regulated companies charges of $53.2 million (for further information, see the Regulated Companies portion of this Overview section), costs of $34 million at NU parent related to investment advisory fees, attorney fees, and consulting costs, an $11.5 million charge related to change in control costs and other compensation costs at NU parent, and an $8.9 million charge at NU parent for the establishment of a fund to advance Connecticut energy goals related to the Connecticut merger settlement agreement. Excluding the impact of the integration and merger-related costs, our 2013 earnings increased by $166.3 million, as compared to 2012, due primarily to the inclusion of NSTAR beginning April 10, 2012, lower overall operations and maintenance costs, higher retail electric and firm natural gas sales, higher transmission segment earnings as a result of increased investments in the transmission infrastructure, and the favorable impact of a lower effective tax rate in 2013 at NU parent. Partially offsetting these favorable earnings impacts were higher depreciation and property tax expense and the establishment of an after-tax reserve of $14.3 million for a potential customer refund related to an August 2013 initial decision from the FERC ALJ. For further information, see "FERC Regulatory Issues - FERC Base ROE Complaint" in this Management's Discussion and Analysis. Regulated Companies: Our Regulated companies consist of the electric distribution, transmission, and natural gas distribution segments. Generation activities of PSNH and WMECO are included in our electric distribution segment. A summary of our segment earnings for 2013, 2012 and 2011 is as follows: For the Years Ended December 31, (Millions of Dollars) 2013 2012 (1) 2011 Net Income Regulated Companies (GAAP) $ 774.9 $ 572.8 $ 420.4 Electric Distribution $ 427.0 $ 343.4 $ 207.0 Transmission 287.0 249.7 199.6 Natural Gas Distribution 60.9 32.9 31.7 Net Income Regulated Companies (Non-GAAP) 774.9 626.0 438.3 Merger-Related Costs (after-tax) (2) - (53.2) - Storm Fund Reserve (3) - - (17.9) Net Income - Regulated Companies (GAAP) $ 774.9 $ 572.8 $ 420.4 (1) Results include the operations of NSTAR beginning April 10, 2012. (2) Merger-related costs are attributable to the electric distribution segment ($51.1 million) and the natural gas distribution segment ($2.1 million). (3) The storm fund reserve is attributable to the electric distribution segment. The 2012 after-tax merger-related costs consisted of $27.6 million ($46 million pre-tax) in charges at CL&P, NSTAR Electric, NSTAR Gas and WMECO for customer bill credits related to the Connecticut and Massachusetts merger settlement agreements, a $23.6 million ($40 million pre-tax) charge related to the Connecticut merger settlement agreement, whereby CL&P agreed to forego recovery of previously deferred storm restoration costs associated with Tropical Storm Irene and the October 2011 snowstorm, and a $2 million charge related to change in control costs and other compensation costs. Excluding the impact of the merger-related costs, our electric distribution segment earnings increased in 2013, as compared to 2012, due primarily to the inclusion of NSTAR Electric distribution business earnings, lower overall operations and maintenance costs and higher retail electric sales due primarily to colder weather in the first and fourth quarters of 2013, as compared to the same periods in 2012. The 2013 results were also favorably impacted by PSNH rate increases effective July 1, 2012 and July 1, 2013 as a result of the 2010 distribution rate case settlement. Partially offsetting these favorable earnings impacts were higher depreciation and property tax expense. 34 Our transmission segment earnings increased in 2013, as compared to 2012, due primarily to the inclusion of NSTAR Electric transmission business earnings, increased investments in our transmission infrastructure, including GSRP, and the favorable impact of a lower effective tax rate in 2013, partially offset by the $14.3 million after-tax reserve related to the August 2013 FERC ALJ initial decision. Excluding the impact of the merger-related costs, our natural gas distribution segment earnings increased in 2013, as compared to 2012, due primarily to the inclusion of NSTAR Gas earnings, higher firm natural gas sales due primarily to colder weather in the first and fourth quarters of 2013, as compared to the same periods in 2012, as well as the addition of approximately 10,000 new natural gas heating customers in 2013, and the favorable impact related to an increase in Yankee Gas rates effective July 1, 2012 as a result of the Yankee Gas 2011 rate case decision. A summary of our retail electric GWh sales and percentage changes, assuming NSTAR Electric had been part of the NU electric distribution system for all periods, as well as percentage changes in CL&P, NSTAR Electric, PSNH and WMECO retail electric GWh sales, is as follows: For the Year Ended December 31, 2013 Compared to 2012 Sales (GWh) NU - Electric 2013 2012 (1) Percentage Increase/ (Decrease) Residential 21,896 21,374 2.4 % Commercial (2) 27,787 27,647 0.5 % Industrial 5,648 5,787 (2.4)% Total 55,331 54,808 1.0 % For the Year Ended December 31, 2013 Compared to 2012 CL&P NSTAR Electric PSNH WMECO Electric Percentage Increase/ (Decrease) Percentage Increase/ (Decrease) Percentage Increase Percentage Increase/ (Decrease) Residential 3.4 % 1.3 % 2.2% 1.7 % Commercial (2) 0.7 % 0.4 % 0.6% (0.4)% Industrial (4.4)% (3.0)% 2.1% (3.0)% Total 1.3 % 0.5 % 1.5% - % (1) Results include retail electric sales of NSTAR Electric from January 1, 2012 through December 31, 2012 for comparative purposes only. (2) Commercial retail electric GWh sales include streetlighting and railroad retail sales. A summary of our firm natural gas sales in million cubic feet and percentage changes, assuming NSTAR Gas had been part of the NU natural gas distribution system for all periods, as well as percentage changes in Yankee Gas and NSTAR Gas, for 2013, as compared to 2012, is as follows: For the Year Ended December 31, 2013 Compared to 2012 Sales (million cubic feet) Percentage NU - Firm Natural Gas 2013 2012 (1) Increase Residential 36,777 30,873 19.1% Commercial 40,215 35,662 12.8% Industrial 21,266 20,992 1.3% Total 98,258 87,527 12.3% Total, Net of Special Contracts (2) 94,083 81,772 15.1% 35 For the Year Ended December 31, 2013 Compared to 2012 Sales (million cubic feet) Yankee Gas NSTAR Gas (3) Percentage Percentage Firm Natural Gas Increase/(Decrease) Increase Residential 19.0 % 19.2% Commercial 13.9 % 11.8% Industrial (1.9)% 10.9% Total 9.8 % 14.9% Total, Net of Special Contracts (2) 15.3 % (1) Results include firm natural gas sales of NSTAR Gas from January 1, 2012 through December 31, 2012 for comparative purposes only. (2) Special contracts are unique to the customers who take service under such an arrangement and generally specify the amount of distribution revenue to be paid to Yankee Gas regardless of the customers usage. (3) NSTAR Gas sales data for the year ended December 31, 2013 compared to 2012 has been provided for comparative purposes only. Weather, fluctuations in energy supply costs, conservation measures (including company-sponsored energy efficiency programs), and economic conditions affect customer energy usage. Industrial sales are less sensitive to temperature variations than residential and commercial sales. In our service territories, weather impacts electric sales during the summer and electric and natural gas sales during the winter (natural gas sales are more sensitive to temperature variations than electric sales). Customer heating or cooling usage may not directly correlate with historical levels or with the level of degree-days that occur. In addition, our electric and natural gas businesses are susceptible to damage from major storms and other natural events and disasters that could adversely affect our ability to provide energy. Our 2013 consolidated retail electric sales were higher, as compared to 2012, due primarily to colder weather in the first and fourth quarters of 2013. The 2013 retail electric sales for CL&P, NSTAR Electric and PSNH increased while they remained unchanged for WMECO, as compared to 2012, due primarily to colder weather in the first and fourth quarters of 2013. In 2013, heating degree days were 17 percent higher in Connecticut and western Massachusetts, 16 percent higher in the Boston metropolitan area, and 15 percent higher in New Hampshire, and cooling degree days were 7 percent lower in Connecticut and western Massachusetts, 2 percent higher in the Boston metropolitan area, and 9 percent lower in New Hampshire, as compared to 2012. On a weather-normalized basis (based on 30-year average temperatures), 2013 retail electric sales for CL&P and PSNH increased, while they decreased for NSTAR Electric and WMECO, as compared to 2012. The 2013 weather-normalized NU consolidated total retail electric sales remained relatively unchanged, as compared to 2012. For WMECO, fluctuations in retail electric sales do not impact earnings due to the DPU-approved revenue decoupling mechanism. Under this decoupling mechanism, WMECO has an overall fixed annual level of distribution delivery service revenues of $132.4 million, comprised of customer base rate revenues of $125.4 million and a baseline low income discount recovery of $7 million. These two mechanisms effectively break the relationship between sales volume and revenues recognized. Our 2013 consolidated firm natural gas sales are subject to many of the same influences as our retail electric sales, but have benefitted from favorable natural gas prices and customer growth across all three customer classes. Our 2013 consolidated firm natural gas sales were higher, as compared to 2012, due primarily to colder weather in the first and fourth quarters of 2013. The 2013 weather-normalized NU consolidated total firm natural gas sales increased 0.9 percent, as compared to 2012, due primarily to residential customer growth, an increase in natural gas conversions, the migration of interruptible customers switching to firm service rates, and the addition of gas-fired distributed generation, all of which was primarily in the Yankee Gas service territory. NU Parent and Other Companies: NU parent and other companies (which includes certain subsidiaries of NSTAR beginning April 10, 2012, and our competitive businesses held by NU Enterprises) earned $11.1 million in 2013, compared with net losses of $46.9 million in 2012. Excluding the impact of integration and merger-related costs of $13.8 million in 2013 and $54.4 million in 2012, NU parent and other companies earned $24.9 million in 2013, compared with $7.5 million in 2012. Improved 2013 results were due primarily to a lower effective tax rate, a decrease in interest expense at NU parent, and an increase in earnings at the unregulated businesses. Future Outlook 2014 EPS Guidance : We currently project 2014 earnings of between $2.60 and $2.75 per share. Liquidity Consolidated: Cash and cash equivalents totaled $43.4 million as of December 31, 2013, compared with $45.7 million as of December 31, 2012. CL&P issued $400 million of 2.5 percent 2013 Series A First and Refunding Mortgage Bonds on January 15, 2013, due to mature in 2023. The proceeds, net of issuance costs, were used to pay short-term borrowings outstanding under the CL&P credit agreement of $89 million and intercompany loans related to our commercial paper program of $305.8 million. On September 3, 2013, CL&P 36 redeemed at par $125 million of 1.25 percent Series B 2011 PCRBs, which were subject to mandatory tender for purchase, using short-term debt. NSTAR Electric issued $200 million of three-year floating rate debentures on May 17, 2013, due to mature in 2016. The proceeds, net of issuance costs, were used to pay short-term borrowings and for general corporate purposes. PSNH redeemed at par approximately $109 million of the 5.45 percent 2001 Series C PCRBs on May 1, 2013, which were due to mature in 2021, using short-term debt. On November 14, 2013, PSNH issued $250 million of 3.50 percent Series S First Mortgage Bonds, due to mature in 2023. On December 23, 2013, PSNH redeemed approximately $89 million of the 4.75 percent Series B PCRBs, which were due to mature in 2021, using a portion of the proceeds from the Series S First Mortgage Bonds. The remaining Series S First Mortgage Bond proceeds were used to pay short-term borrowings. WMECO repaid at maturity $55 million of 5 percent Series A Senior Notes on September 1, 2013, using short-term debt. On November 15, 2013, WMECO issued $80 million of 3.88 percent Series G Senior Notes, due to mature in 2023. The proceeds, net of issuance costs, were used to pay short-term borrowings and for other working capital purposes. NU parent issued $750 million of Senior Notes on May 13, 2013, consisting of $300 million of 1.45 percent Series E Senior Notes, due to mature in 2018, and $450 million of 2.80 percent Series F Senior Notes, due to mature in 2023. The proceeds, net of issuance costs, were used to repay the NU parent $250 million 5.65 percent Series C Senior Notes that matured on June 1, 2013 and the NU parent $300 million floating rate Series D Senior Notes that matured on September 20, 2013. The remaining net proceeds were used to repay commercial paper program borrowings and for working capital purposes. Yankee Gas issued $100 million of 4.82 percent Series L First Mortgage Bonds on January 2, 2014, due to mature in 2044. The proceeds, net of issuance costs, were used to repay the $75 million 4.80 percent Series G First Mortgage Bonds that matured on January 1, 2014 and to pay $25 million in short-term borrowings. On July 31, 2013, the FERC granted authorization allowing CL&P and WMECO to incur total short-term borrowings up to a maximum of $600 million and $300 million, respectively, effective January 1, 2014 through December 31, 2015. On May 16, 2012, the FERC granted authorization to allow NSTAR Electric to issue total short-term debt securities in an aggregate principal amount not to exceed $655 million outstanding at any one time, effective October 23, 2012 through October 23, 2014. On December 23, 2013, the DPU authorized NSTAR Electric to issue up to $800 million in long-term debt for the two-year period ending December 31, 2015. On September 26, 2013, the NHPUC issued an order, effective October 8, 2013, approving PSNH's request to issue up to $315 million in long-term debt through December 31, 2014, and to refinance approximately $89 million Series B PCRBs through its existing maturity of May 2021. On September 6, 2013, NU parent, CL&P, PSNH, WMECO, NSTAR Gas and Yankee Gas amended their joint five-year $1.15 billion revolving credit facility, dated July 25, 2012, by increasing the aggregate principal amount available thereunder by $300 million to $1.45 billion, extending the expiration date from July 25, 2017 to September 6, 2018, and increasing CL&P's borrowing sub-limit from $300 million to $600 million. PSNH and WMECO each have borrowing sub-limits of $300 million. Simultaneously, effective September 6, 2013, the CL&P $300 million revolving credit facility was terminated. On September 6, 2013, NSTAR Electric amended its five-year $450 million revolving credit facility, dated July 25, 2012, by extending the expiration date from July 25, 2017 to September 6, 2018. On September 6, 2013, NU parent $1.15 billion commercial paper program was increased by $300 million to $1.45 billion. As of December 31, 2013, NU had approximately $1.01 billion in short-term borrowings outstanding under its commercial paper program, leaving $435.5 million of available borrowing capacity. The weighted-average interest rate on these borrowings as of December 31, 2013 was 0.24 percent, which is generally based on money market rates. As of December 31, 2013, NSTAR Electric had $ 103.5 million in short-term borrowings outstanding under its commercial paper program, leaving $ 346.5 million of available borrowing capacity. The weighted-average interest rate on these borrowings as of December 31, 2013 was 0.13 percent, which is generally based on money market rates. Each of NU, CL&P, NSTAR Electric, PSNH and WMECO use its available capital resources to fund its respective construction expenditures, meet debt requirements, pay operating costs, including storm-related costs, pay dividends and fund other corporate obligations, such as pension contributions. The current growth in NU transmission construction expenditures utilizes a significant amount of cash for projects that have a long-term return on investment and recovery period. In addition, NU Regulated companies recover its electric and natural gas distribution construction expenditures as the related project costs are depreciated over the life of the assets. This impacts the timing of the revenue stream designed to fully recover the total investment plus a return on the equity portion of the cost and related financing costs. These factors have resulted in current liabilities exceeding current assets by approximately $1.2 billion, $398 million and $339 million at NU, CL&P and NSTAR Electric, respectively, as of December 31, 2013. As of December 31, 2013, $501.7 million of NU's obligations classified as current liabilities relates to long-term debt that will be paid in the next 12 months, consisting of $150 million for CL&P, $301.7 million for NSTAR Electric and $50 million for PSNH. In addition, $31.7 million relates to the amortization of the purchase accounting fair value adjustment that will be amortized in the next twelve months. NU, with its strong credit ratings, has several options available in the financial markets to repay or refinance these maturities with the issuance of new long-term debt. NU, CL&P, NSTAR Electric, PSNH and WMECO will reduce their short-term borrowings with cash 37 received from operating cash flows or with the issuance of new long-term debt, determined considering capital requirements and maintenance of NU's credit rating and profile. Management expects the future operating cash flows of NU, CL&P, NSTAR Electric, PSNH and WMECO, along with the access to financial markets, will be sufficient to meet any future operating requirements and capital investment forecasted opportunities. On March 15, 2013, NSTAR Electric made its final principal and interest payment on approximately $675 million of RRBs that were issued in March 2005. On May 1, 2013, PSNH made its final principal and interest payment on approximately $525 million of RRBs that were issued in April 2001. On June 1, 2013, WMECO made its final principal and interest payment on approximately $155 million of RRBs that were issued in May 2001. As a result, NSTAR Electric, PSNH and WMECO are no longer recovering any payments from customers associated with these RRBs, which reduced NSTAR Electric s, PSNH and WMECO cash flows provided by operating activities in 2013, compared with 2012. There was no impact on operating cash flows net of RRB payments. Cash flows provided by operating activities totaled $1.58 billion in 2013, compared with $1.05 billion in 2012 and $901.1 million in 2011 (all amounts are net of RRB payments, which are included in financing activities on the accompanying statements of cash flows). The improved operating cash flows were due primarily to the addition of NSTAR, which contributed $138.1 million of operating cash flows (net of RRB payments) in the first quarter of 2013, a decrease of approximately $100 million in cash disbursements for storm restoration costs associated primarily with the February 2013 blizzard, as compared to 2012 cash disbursements for storm restoration costs associated primarily with Tropical Storm Irene and the October 2011 snowstorm, the absence in 2013 of $73 million in 2012 cash disbursements at CL&P, NSTAR Electric, NSTAR Gas and WMECO related to customer bill credits, and the absence in 2013 of $35 million of merger-related cash payments made in 2012. In addition, operating cash flows benefited from an increase in amortization of regulatory deferrals primarily attributable to tracking mechanisms where such revenues exceeded costs resulting in a favorable cash flow impact. Partially offsetting these favorable cash flow impacts was a $62.3 million increase in Pension Plan cash contributions, increases in coal and fuel inventories, and changes in traditional working capital amounts due primarily to the timing of accounts receivable and accounts payable. The improved operating cash flows in 2012, compared with 2011, were due primarily to the addition of NSTAR, partially offset by an increase in storm restoration costs, pension plan cash contributions, customer bill credits, and merger-related costs.

On January 31, 2014, Moody's upgraded corporate credit and securities ratings of NU, CL&P and PSNH by one level and WMECO by two-levels. We paid common dividends of $462.7 million in 2013, compared with $375 million in 2012. The increase was due primarily to the issuance of approximately 136 million of NU common shares to the NSTAR shareholders on April 10, 2012 as a result of the merger, and an increase of approximately 7.1 percent in our common dividend paid beginning in March 2013. On February 4, 2014, our Board of Trustees approved a common dividend payment of $0.3925 per share, payable on March 31, 2014 to shareholders of record as of March 3, 2014. The dividend represented an increase of 6.8 percent over the dividend paid in December 2013. CL&P, NSTAR Electric, PSNH, and WMECO paid $152 million, $56 million, $68 million, and $40 million, respectively, in common dividends to their respective parent company in 2013. Investments in Property, Plant and Equipment on the accompanying statements of cash flows do not include amounts incurred on capital projects but not yet paid, cost of removal, AFUDC related to equity funds, and, for certain subsidiaries, the capitalized portions of pension expense. In 2013, investments for NU, CL&P, NSTAR Electric, PSNH, and WMECO were $1.5 billion, $434.9 million, $476.6 million, $186 million, and $128.8 million, respectively. 38 Business Development and Capital Expenditures Consolidated: Our consolidated capital expenditures, including amounts incurred but not paid, cost of removal, AFUDC, and the capitalized portions of pension expense (all of which are non-cash factors), totaled $1.6 billion in 2013, $1.5 billion in 2012, and $1.2 billion in 2011. These amounts included $44.7 million in 2013, $43.1 million in 2012, and $51.9 million in 2011, related to our corporate service companies, NUSCO and RRR. Transmission Business : Overall, transmission business capital expenditures increased by $10.5 million in 2013, as compared with 2012, due primarily to the addition of NSTAR Electric's capital expenditures, partially offset by the completion of the WMECO portion of GSRP. A summary of transmission capital expenditures by company in 2013, 2012 and 2011 is as follows: For the Years Ended December 31, (Millions of Dollars) 2013 2012 (1) 2011 CL&P $ 211.9 $ 182.5 $ 128.6 NSTAR Electric 220.8 160.7 N/A PSNH 99.7 55.7 68.1 WMECO 87.2 214.7 236.8 NPT 39.9 35.4 25.9 Total Transmission Segment $ 659.5 $ 649.0 $ 459.4 (1) Results include the transmission capital expenditures of NSTAR Electric beginning April 10, 2012. NEEWS: GSRP, the first, largest and most complicated project within the NEEWS family of projects was fully energized on November 20, 2013. The project involved the construction of 115 kV and 345 kV overhead lines by CL&P and WMECO from Ludlow, Massachusetts to Bloomfield, Connecticut. This transmission upgrade ensures the reliable flow of power in and around the southern New England area and enables access to less expensive generation, further reducing the risk of congestion costs impacting New England customers. The project was fully energized ahead of schedule with a final cost of $676 million, $42 million under the $718 million estimated cost. As of December 31, 2013, CL&P and WMECO have placed $628.2 million in service. The Interstate Reliability Project, which includes CL&P construction of an approximately 40-mile, 345 kV overhead line from Lebanon, Connecticut to the Connecticut-Rhode Island border in Thompson, Connecticut where it will connect to transmission enhancements being constructed by National Grid, is the second major NEEWS project. All siting applications have been filed by CL&P and National Grid. The Connecticut and Rhode Island portions of the project have been approved and a siting approval decision in Massachusetts is expected in early 2014. On February 12, 2014, the Army Corps of Engineers issued its permit enabling construction on the Connecticut portion of the project. This is the final permit for the Connecticut portion of the project. NU portion of the cost is estimated to be $218 million and the project is expected to be placed in service in late 2015. The Greater Hartford Central Connecticut Study (GHCC), which includes the reassessment of the Central Connecticut Reliability Project, continues to make progress. The final need results, which were presented to the ISO-NE Planning Advisory Committee in November 2013, showed existing and worsening severe regional and local thermal overloads and voltage violations within and across each of the four study areas. ISO-NE is expected to confirm the preferred transmission solutions in the first half of 2014, which are likely to include many 115 kV upgrades. We continue to expect that the specific future projects being identified to address these reliability concerns will cost approximately $300 million and that the project will be placed in service in 2017. Included as part of NEEWS are associated reliability related projects, $90.8 million of which have been placed in service. As of December 31, 2013, the remaining construction on the associated reliability related projects totaled $2.8 million, which is scheduled to be completed by mid-2014. Through December 31, 2013, CL&P and WMECO capitalized $252.8 million and $567 million, respectively, in costs associated with NEEWS, of which $40.8 million and $48.9 million, respectively, were capitalized in 2013. Cape Cod Reliability Projects: Transmission projects serving Cape Cod in the Southeastern Massachusetts (SEMA) reliability region consist of an expansion and upgrade of NSTAR Electric's existing transmission infrastructure including construction of a new 345 kV transmission line that crosses the Cape Cod Canal and associated 115 kV upgrades in the center of Cape Cod (Lower SEMA Project) and related 115 kV projects (Mid-Cape Project). The Lower SEMA Project line work was completed and placed into service in 2013. The Mid-Cape Project is scheduled to be completed in 2017. The aggregate estimated construction cost for the Cape Cod projects is expected to be approximately $150 million. Through December 31, 2013, NSTAR Electric has invested $96 million in costs associated with the Cape Cod Reliability Projects, of which $61 million was capitalized in 2013. Northern Pass: Northern Pass is NPT's planned HVDC transmission line from the Qu bec-New Hampshire border to Franklin, New Hampshire and an associated alternating current radial transmission line between Franklin and Deerfield, New Hampshire. Northern Pass will interconnect at the Qu bec-New Hampshire border with a planned HQ HVDC transmission line. The $1.4 billion project is subject to comprehensive federal and state public permitting processes and is expected to be operational by mid-2017. On July 1, 2013, NPT filed an amendment to the DOE Presidential Permit Application for a proposed improved route in the northernmost section of the project area. As of December 31, 2013, the DOE had completed its public scoping meeting process and the majority of its seasonal field work and environmental data collection. NPT expects to file its state permit application in the fourth quarter of 2014 after the DOE draft Environmental Impact Statement (EIS) is received. 39 NPT filed an amendment to the Transmission Services Agreement (TSA) with FERC on December 11, 2013, which was accepted by the FERC on January 13, 2014. The TSA amendment that went into effect on February 14, 2014 extended certain deadlines to provide project flexibility and eliminated a penalty payment for termination of the project in the future. On December 31, 2013, NPT received ISO-NE approval under Section I.3.9 of the ISO tariff. By approving the project Section I.3.9 application, ISO-NE determined that Northern Pass can reliably interconnect with the New England grid with no significant, adverse effect on the reliability or operating characteristics of the regional energy grid and its participants. Greater Boston Reliability and Boston Network Improvements: As a result of continued analysis of the transmission needs to enhance system reliability and improve capacity in eastern Massachusetts, NSTAR Electric expects to implement a series of new transmission initiatives over the next five years. We expect projected costs to be approximately $440 million on these new initiatives. Distribution Business : A summary of distribution capital expenditures by company for 2013, 2012 and 2011 is as follows: For the Years Ended December 31, (Millions of Dollars) 2013 2012 (1) 2011 CL&P: Basic Business $ 60.9 $ 69.2 $ 166.6 Aging Infrastructure 160.7 177.8 112.3 Load Growth 76.9 65.8 59.6 Total CL&P 298.5 312.8 338.5 NSTAR Electric: Basic Business 98.5 47.3 N/A Aging Infrastructure 110.6 111.5 N/A Load Growth 53.6 17.4 N/A Total NSTAR Electric 262.7 176.2 N/A PSNH: Basic Business 22.7 25.3 47.7 Aging Infrastructure 50.5 50.2 25.3 Load Growth 29.3 20.2 25.8 Total PSNH 102.5 95.7 98.8 WMECO: Basic Business 7.9 12.7 24.2 Aging Infrastructure 24.6 18.5 11.5 Load Growth 9.2 6.5 6.1 Total WMECO 41.7 37.7 41.8 Total - Electric Distribution (excluding Generation) 705.4 622.4 479.1 Total - Natural Gas 175.2 162.9 102.8 Other Distribution 0.7 0.1 1.0 Total Electric and Natural Gas 881.3 785.4 582.9 PSNH Generation: Clean Air Project - 22.0 101.1 Other 9.7 7.9 23.7 Total PSNH Generation 9.7 29.9 124.8 WMECO Generation 4.5 0.7 11.7 Total Distribution Segment $ 895.5 $ 816.0 $ 719.4 (1) Results include the electric and natural gas distribution capital expenditures of NSTAR beginning April 10, 2012. For the electric distribution business, basic business includes the purchase of meters, tools, vehicles, information technology, transformer replacements, equipment facilities, and the relocation of plant. Aging infrastructure relates to reliability and the replacement of overhead lines, distribution substations, underground cable replacement, and equipment failures. Load growth includes requests for new business and capacity additions on distribution lines and substation additions and expansions. CL&P System Resiliency Plan: In accordance with the PURA-approved System Resiliency Plan, CL&P will spend approximately $300 million to improve the resiliency of its electric distribution system, which includes vegetation management. CL&P expects to complete the plan in five years in two separate phases. Costs of Phase 1 of the plan, which is primarily focused on vegetation management, totaled approximately $32 million in 2013 and is estimated to cost $53 million in 2014. Phase 2 of the plan is estimated to cost approximately $215 million over the period from 2015 through 2017. WMECO Solar Project: On September 4, 2013, the DPU approved WMECO's proposal to build a third solar generation facility and expand its solar energy portfolio from 6 MW to 8 MW. On October 22, 2013, WMECO announced it would install a 3.9 MW solar generation facility on a site in East Springfield, Massachusetts. The facility is expected to be completed in mid-2014 at an estimated cost of approximately $15 million. 40 Yankee Gas Expansion Plan: In accordance with 2013 Connecticut law and regulation, on June 14, 2013, Yankee Gas and other Connecticut natural gas distribution companies filed a comprehensive joint natural gas infrastructure expansion plan (expansion plan) with DEEP and PURA. The expansion plan described how Yankee Gas expects to add approximately 82,000 new natural gas heating customers over the next 10 years. Yankee Gas estimates that its portion of the plan will cost approximately $700 million over 10 years. For further information on the expansion plan, see "Regulatory Developments and Rate Matters - Connecticut - Yankee Gas Natural Gas Expansion Plan" in this Management Discussion and Analysis. For further information on the Connecticut law, see "Legislative and Policy Matters - Connecticut" in this Management Discussion and Analysis. Projected Capital Expenditures : A summary of the projected capital expenditures for the Regulated companies' electric transmission and for the total electric distribution, generation, and natural gas distribution businesses for 2014 through 2017, including our corporate service companies' capital expenditures on behalf of the Regulated companies, is as follows: Year (Millions of Dollars) 2014 2015 2016 2017 2014-2017 Total CL&P Transmission $ 247 $ 199 $ 178 $ 165 $ 789 NSTAR Electric Transmission 191 250 285 202 928 PSNH Transmission 106 124 123 42 395 WMECO Transmission 73 85 49 2 209 NPT 47 222 610 487 1,366 Total Transmission $ 664 $ 880 $ 1,245 $ 898 $ 3,687 Electric Distribution $ 679 $ 647 $ 647 $ 619 $ 2,592 Generation 24 34 20 15 93 Natural Gas 189 219 201 227 836 Total Distribution $ 892 $ 900 $ 868 $ 861 $ 3,521 Corporate Service Companies $ 117 $ 93 $ 76 $ 76 $ 362 Total $ 1,673 $ 1,873 $ 2,189 $ 1,835 $ 7,570 Actual capital expenditures could vary from the projected amounts for the companies and years above. FERC Regulatory Issues FERC Base ROE Complaint: On September 30, 2011, several New England state attorneys general, state regulatory commissions, consumer advocates and other parties filed a joint complaint with the FERC under Sections 206 and 306 of the Federal Power Act alleging that the base ROE used in calculating formula rates for transmission service under the ISO-NE Open Access Transmission Tariff by NETOs, including CL&P, NSTAR Electric, PSNH and WMECO, is unjust and unreasonable. The complainants asserted that the current 11.14 percent rate, which became effective in 2006, is excessive due to changes in the capital markets and are seeking an order to reduce the rate, which would be effective October 1, 2011. In response, the NETOs filed testimony and analysis based on standard FERC methodology and precedent demonstrating that the base ROE of 11.14 percent remained just and reasonable. The FERC set the case for trial before a FERC ALJ after settlement negotiations were unsuccessful in August 2012. Hearings before the FERC ALJ were held in May 2013, followed by the filing of briefs by the complainants, the Massachusetts municipal electric utilities (late interveners to the case), the FERC trial staff and the NETOs. The NETOs recommended that the current base ROE of 11.14 percent should remain in effect for the refund period (October 1, 2011 through December 31, 2012) and the prospective period (beginning when FERC issues its final decision). The complainants, the Massachusetts municipal electric utilities, and the FERC trial staff each recommended a base ROE of 9 percent or below. On August 6, 2013, the FERC ALJ issued an initial decision, finding that the base ROE in effect from October 2011 through December 2012 was not reasonable under the standard application of FERC methodology, but leaving policy considerations and additional adjustments to the FERC. Using the established FERC methodology, the FERC ALJ determined that separate base ROEs should be set for the refund period and the prospective period. The FERC ALJ found those base ROEs to be 10.6 percent and 9.7 percent, respectively. The FERC may adjust the prospective period base ROE in its final decision to reflect movement in 10-year Treasury bond rates from the date that the case was filed (April 2013) to the date of the final decision. The parties filed briefs on this decision with the FERC, and a decision from the FERC is expected in 2014. Though NU cannot predict the ultimate outcome of this proceeding, in 2013 the Company recorded a series of reserves at its electric subsidiaries to recognize the potential financial impact from the FERC ALJ's initial decision for the refund period. The aggregate after-tax charge to earnings totaled $14.3 million at NU, which represents reserves of $7.7 million at CL&P, $3.4 million at NSTAR Electric, $1.4 million at PSNH and $1.8 million at WMECO. On December 27, 2012, several additional parties filed a separate complaint concerning the NETOs' base ROE with the FERC. This complaint seeks to reduce the NETOs base ROE effective January 1, 2013, effectively extending the refund period for an additional 15 months, and to consolidate this complaint with the joint complaint filed on September 30, 2011. The NETOs have asked the FERC to reject this complaint. The FERC has not yet acted on this complaint, and management is unable to predict the ultimate outcome or estimate the impacts of this complaint on the financial position, results of operations or cash flows. As of December 31, 2013, the CL&P, NSTAR Electric, PSNH, and WMECO aggregate shareholder equity invested in their transmission facilities was approximately $2.3 billion. As a result, each 10 basis point change in the prospective period authorized base ROE would change annual consolidated earnings by an approximate $2.3 million. 41 Regulatory Developments and Rate Matters Electric and Natural Gas Base Distribution Rates: Each NU utility subsidiary is subject to the regulatory jurisdiction of the state in which it operates: CL&P and Yankee Gas operate in Connecticut and are subject to PURA regulation; NSTAR Electric, WMECO and NSTAR Gas operate in Massachusetts and are subject to DPU regulation; and PSNH operates in New Hampshire and is subject to NHPUC regulation. In Connecticut, pursuant to the April 2012 PURA-approved Connecticut merger settlement agreement, CL&P is subject to a base distribution rate freeze until December 1, 2014. Yankee Gas distribution rates were established in a 2011 PURA approved rate case. See Connecticut - Yankee Gas Distribution Rate Case in this Regulatory Developments and Rate Matters section for further information. In Massachusetts, "An Act Relative to Competitively Priced Electricity in the Commonwealth" (Energy Act), which was enacted in 2012, requires electric utility companies to file at least one distribution rate case every five years and natural gas companies to file at least one distribution rate case every 10 years, and limits those companies to one settlement agreement in any 10-year period. Pursuant to the April 2012 DPU-approved Massachusetts comprehensive merger settlement agreements, NSTAR Electric, WMECO and NSTAR Gas are subject to a base distribution rate freeze through December 31, 2015. In New Hampshire, PSNH is currently operating under the 2010 NHPUC approved distribution rate case settlement, which is effective through June 30, 2015. Under the settlement, PSNH is permitted to file a request to collect certain exogenous costs and step increases on an annual basis. See New Hampshire - Distribution Rates in this Regulatory Developments and Rate Matters section for further information. As a result of the PURA-approved Connecticut merger settlement agreement, we expect to file a CL&P base distribution rate proceeding in mid-2014 with base distribution rates effective December 1, 2014. The exact timing of the base distribution rate proceedings for our other utility subsidiaries has not yet been determined. Major Storms: 2013, 2012 and 2011 Major Storms : Over the past three years, CL&P, NSTAR Electric, PSNH and WMECO each experienced significant storms, including Tropical Storm Irene, the October 2011 snowstorm, Storm Sandy, and the February 2013 blizzard. As a result of these storms, each electric utility company suffered damage to its distribution and transmission systems, which caused customer outages and required the incurrence of costs to repair significant damage and restore customer service. The magnitude of these storm restoration costs met the criteria for cost deferral in Connecticut, Massachusetts, and New Hampshire. As a result, the storms had no material impact on the results of operations of CL&P, NSTAR Electric, PSNH and WMECO. We believe our response to each of these storms was prudent and therefore we believe it is probable that CL&P, NSTAR Electric, PSNH and WMECO will be allowed to recover the deferred storm restoration costs. Each electric utility company is seeking recovery of its deferred storm restoration costs through its applicable regulatory recovery process. CL&P 2013 Storm Filing : In March 2013, CL&P filed a request with PURA for approval to recover storm restoration costs associated with five major storms, all of which occurred in 2011 and 2012. CL&P's deferred storm restoration costs associated with these major storms totaled $462 million. Of that amount, approximately $414 million is subject to recovery in rates after giving effect to CL&P agreement to forego the recovery of $40 million of previously deferred storm restoration costs as well as an existing storm reserve fund balance of approximately $8 million. During the second half of 2013, the PURA proceeded with the storm recovery review issuing discovery, holding hearings and ultimately on February 3, 2014, issuing a draft decision on the level of storm costs recovery. In its draft decision, the PURA approved recovery of $365 million of deferred storm restoration costs and ordered CL&P to capitalize approximately $18 million of the deferred storm restoration costs as utility plant, which will be included in depreciation expense in future rate proceedings. PURA will allow recovery of the $365 million with carrying charges in CL&P distribution rates over a six-year period beginning December 1, 2014. The remaining costs were either disallowed or are probable of recovery in future rates and did not have a material impact on CL&P financial position, results of operations or cash flows. The final decision is expected from PURA in the first quarter of 2014. NSTAR Electric 2013 Storm Filing : On December 30, 2013, the DPU approved NSTAR Electric request to recover storm restoration costs, plus carrying costs, related to Tropical Storm Irene and the October 2011 snowstorm. The DPU approved recovery of $34.2 million of the $38 million requested costs. NSTAR Electric will recover these costs, plus carrying costs, in its distribution rates over a five-year period that commenced on January 1, 2014. PSNH Major Storm Cost Reserve : On June 27, 2013, the NHPUC approved an increase to PSNH distribution rates effective July 1, 2013 that included a $5 million increase to the current level of funding for the major storm cost reserve. WMECO SRRCA Mechanism : WMECO has an established Storm Reserve Recovery Cost Adjustment (SRRCA) mechanism to recover the restoration costs associated with its major storms. Effective January 1, 2012, WMECO began recovering the restoration costs of Tropical Storm Irene and other storms that took place prior to August 2011. On August 30, 2013, WMECO submitted its 2013 Annual SRRCA filing to begin recovering the restoration costs associated with the October 2011 snowstorm and Storm Sandy. On 42 December 20, 2013, the DPU approved the 2013 Annual SRRCA filing for effect on January 1, 2014, subject to further review and reconciliation. 2013, 2012 and 2011 Major Storm Deferrals : As of December 31, 2013, the storm restoration costs deferred for recovery from customers for major storms that occurred during 2013, 2012 and 2011 at CL&P, NSTAR Electric, PSNH, and WMECO were as follows: (Millions of Dollars) 2012 and 2011 2013 Total CL&P $ 365.0 $ 28.8 $ 393.8 NSTAR Electric 61.3 63.6 124.9 PSNH 33.7 5.3 39.0 WMECO 35.3 - 35.3 Total $ 495.3 $ 97.7 $ 593.0 DPU Storm Penalties : Under Massachusetts law and regulation, the DPU has established standards of performance for emergency preparation and restoration of service for electric companies, including required annual ERP filings with the DPU for review and approval. As a remedy to violations of those standards, the DPU is authorized to levy a penalty not to exceed $250,000 for each violation for each day that the violation persists up to a maximum penalty of $20 million for any related series of violations. In December 2012, in separate orders issued by the DPU, NSTAR Electric and WMECO each received penalties related to the electric utilities responses to Tropical Storm Irene and the October 2011 snowstorm. The DPU ordered penalties of $4.1 million and $2 million for NSTAR Electric and WMECO, respectively, which were refunded to their customers. In December 2012, NSTAR Electric and WMECO each filed appeals with the SJC arguing the DPU penalties should be vacated. NSTAR Electric and WMECO filed initial briefs on November 5, 2013. Oral arguments are scheduled for March 2014. Emergency Response Plans : Under Connecticut law and regulation, the PURA has established performance standards that electric and natural gas companies incorporated into their ERPs and operations in 2013. CL&P and Yankee Gas will be subject to penalties levied by PURA of up to 2.5 percent of annual distribution revenues for failure to meet performance standards. In 2013, CL&P and Yankee Gas met the established performance standards. Connecticut: CL&P Standard Service and Last Resort Service Rates : CL&P's residential and small commercial customers who do not choose competitive suppliers are served under SS rates, and large commercial and industrial customers who do not choose competitive suppliers are served under LRS rates. Effective January 1, 2014, the PURA approved an increase to CL&P energy supply portion of the total average SS rate from 7.638 cents per kWh to 9.152 cents per kWh and the energy supply portion of the total average LRS rate from 6.698 cents per kWh to 10.762 cents per kWh. These changes were due primarily to the market conditions for the procurement of energy. The SS and LRS rates reflect CL&P costs to procure energy for its customers. Adjustments to these rates do not impact earnings as CL&P is fully recovering the costs of its SS and LRS services from customers. CL&P CTA and SBC Reconciliation : On January 22, 2014, PURA approved CL&P 2012 CTA and SBC reconciliation as filed on April 1, 2013, which compared CTA and SBC billed revenues to revenue requirements, as required by PURA. The 2012 CTA was over recovered by $21.3 million, resulting in a cumulative net under recovered balance of $8.9 million as of December 31, 2012. The 2012 SBC was over recovered by $19.4 million, resulting in a cumulative net under recovery of $19.7 million as of December 31, 2012. CL&P FMCC Filing : Semi-annually, CL&P files with PURA its FMCC filing, which reconciles actual FMCC revenues and charges and GSC revenues and expenses, for the six-month period under consideration. The filing identifies a total net over or under recovery, which includes the remaining uncollected or non-refunded portions from previous filings. On August 1, 2013, CL&P filed with PURA its semi-annual FMCC filing for the period January 1, 2013 through June 30, 2013. This filing also included the June 30, 2013 through December 31, 2013 projected amounts for informational purposes only. The filing identified a total net under recovery of $2.7 million for the period. On February 19, 2014, PURA approved CL&P FMCC filing. CL&P Conservation Adjustment Mechanism : In 2012, CL&P filed an application with PURA for the establishment of a CAM. The CAM would collect the costs associated with expanded energy efficiency programs beyond those already collected through the statutory charge and the revenues lost because of the expanded energy efficiency programs. On September 11, 2013, DEEP approved CL&P expanded 2014 conservation spending budget of $144.6 million. The PURA approved a CAM effective January 1, 2014 subject to a future review of its revenue and expense reconciliation filing to be submitted by CL&P. CL&P Long-Term Wind Contracts : On September 19, 2013, CL&P, along with another Connecticut utility, signed long-term commitments, as required by regulation, to purchase approximately 250 MW of wind power from a Maine wind farm and 20 MW of solar power from sites in Connecticut, at a combined average price of less than 8 cents per kWh. On October 23, 2013, PURA issued a final decision accepting the contracts. The projects are expected to be operational by the end of 2016. For further information, see "Legislative and Policy Matters - Connecticut" in this Management Discussion and Analysis . CL&P System Resiliency Plan : On January 16, 2013, PURA approved the $300 million plan CL&P filed to improve the resiliency of its electric distribution system. For further information, see "Business Development and Capital Expenditures - Distribution Business - CL&P System Resiliency Plan" in this Management Discussion and Analysis . 43 Yankee Gas Distribution Rate Case : On June 29, 2011, PURA issued a final decision in the Yankee Gas rate proceeding, which it subsequently amended on September 28, 2011. The final decision, as amended, approved a regulatory ROE of 8.83 percent, based on a capital structure of 52.2 percent common equity and 47.8 percent debt, approved Yankee Gas WWL Project, and allowed for an increase for bare steel and cast iron pipe annual replacement funding, as requested by Yankee Gas. The changes were effective July 20, 2011 and had the effect of decreasing revenues by $0.2 million for the twelve months ended June 30, 2012 and increasing revenues by $6.9 million for the twelve months ended June 30, 2013. Yankee Gas Natural Gas Expansion Plan : On June 14, 2013, Yankee Gas and other Connecticut natural gas distribution companies filed an expansion plan with DEEP and PURA in response to the Connecticut CES and the recently enacted Connecticut Public Act 13-298, "An Act Concerning Implementation of Connecticut Comprehensive Energy Strategy and Various Revisions to the Energy Statutes." The expansion plan describes how the natural gas distribution companies expect to add approximately 280,000 new natural gas heating customers over the next 10 years. Yankee Gas will serve approximately 82,000 of those customers. The expansion plan outlines a set of comprehensive recommendations, several of which are already incorporated into Public Act 13-298. Key recommendations include providing more flexibility in the process of adding new customers, establishing new regulatory tools to help fund conversion costs over time, providing for mechanisms for timely recovery of capital investments made by natural gas distribution companies and allowing utilities to secure additional pipeline capacity into Connecticut . On July 16, 2013, DEEP issued a determination letter finding the expansion plan was consistent with the CES and requesting certain modifications to be made. On July 26, 2013, the natural gas distribution companies submitted their responses to DEEP and PURA. On November 22, 2013, PURA issued a final decision approving the expansion plan consistent with the goals of the CES. For further information on the Connecticut law, see "Legislative and Policy Matters - Connecticut" in this Management Discussion and Analysis. Massachusetts: Basic Service Rates : Electric distribution companies in Massachusetts are required to obtain and resell power to retail customers through Basic Service for those customers who choose not to buy energy from a competitive energy supplier. Basic Service rates are reset every six months (every three months for large commercial and industrial customers). NSTAR Electric and WMECO fully recover their energy costs through DPU-approved regulatory rate mechanisms. 2014 Annual Reconciliation Filing : On November 1, 2013, NSTAR Electric and WMECO filed separately their respective 2014 annual cost recovery mechanisms, including the mechanisms to collect the costs to provide retail transmission, energy supply and energy efficiency services to its customers as well as the costs related to pension and other post-retirement employee benefit costs. The reconciliation filings compared the total revenues to revenue requirements related to these services. On December 31, 2013, the DPU issued a final decision approving the rates as filed, subject to future review and reconciliation. As of December 31, 2013, we had cumulative deferred net regulatory asset balances related to these services of $142.1 million and $9.9 million for NSTAR Electric and WMECO, respectively. Energy Efficiency Plans : In accordance with Massachusetts law passed in 2008 known as the Green Communities Act, natural gas and electric distribution companies must file three-year energy efficiency plans, which were initially filed by NSTAR Electric, WMECO and NSTAR Gas, and approved by the DPU, in 2010 covering the period 2010 through 2012. The NSTAR Electric, WMECO and NSTAR Gas three-year plans covering the period 2013 through 2015 were approved by the DPU in 2013. Distribution companies that do not yet have rate decoupling mechanisms in place, like NSTAR Electric and NSTAR Gas, include Lost Base Revenue (LBR) rate adjustment mechanisms in order to offset reduced distribution rate revenues as a result of successful energy efficiency programs. For the year ended December 31, 2013, NSTAR Electric, WMECO and NSTAR Gas incurred recoverable Energy Efficiency program expenses of $167.2 million, $38.9 million, and $31 million, respectively. Long-Term Wind Contracts : NSTAR Electric and WMECO, along with two other Massachusetts utilities, signed a long-term commitment, as required by regulation, to purchase wind power from six wind farms in Maine and New Hampshire for a combined estimated generating capacity of approximately 565 MW. On September 20, 2013, these contracts were filed jointly with the DPU. On November 21, 2013, the utility companies provided a supplemental filing to the DPU to reflect the termination of three of the six wind farms. Initial briefs were filed on December 23, 2013 and reply briefs were filed on January 8, 2014. Over the 15-year life of the remaining contracts, the utilities will pay an average price of less than 8 cents per kWh. The projects are in various stages of permitting or development and are expected to begin operation in 2015 and 2016. On November 26, 2012, the DPU approved NSTAR Electric 15-year renewable energy contract with Cape Wind Associates, LLC. Under this contract, NSTAR Electric would purchase 129 MW of renewable energy from an offshore wind energy facility, which is currently expected to achieve commercial operation by May 2016. DPU Safety and Reliability Programs (CPSL) : Since 2006, NSTAR Electric has been recovering incremental costs related to the DPU-approved Safety and Reliability Programs. From 2006 through 2011, cumulative costs associated with the CPSL program resulted in an incremental revenue requirement to customers of approximately $83 million. These amounts included incremental operations and maintenance costs and the related revenue requirement for specific capital investments relative to the CPSL programs. On May 28, 2010, the DPU issued an order on NSTAR Electric 2006 CPSL cost recovery filing (the May 2010 Order). In October 2010, NSTAR Electric filed a reconciliation of the cumulative CPSL program activity for the periods 2006 through 2009 with the DPU in order to determine a proposed rate adjustment. The DPU allowed the proposed rates to go into effect January 1, 2011, subject to final 44 reconciliation of CPSL program costs through a future DPU proceeding. In February 2013, NSTAR Electric updated the October 2010 filing with final activity through 2011. NSTAR Electric recorded its 2006 through 2011 revenues under the CPSL programs based on the May 2010 Order. NSTAR Electric cannot predict the timing of a final DPU order related to its CPSL filings for the period 2006 through 2011. While we do not believe that any subsequent DPU order would result in revenues that are materially different than the amounts already recognized, it is reasonably possible that an order could have a material impact on NSTAR Electric results of operations, financial position and cash flows. The April 4, 2012 DPU-approved comprehensive merger settlement agreement with the Massachusetts Attorney General stipulates that NSTAR Electric must incur a revenue requirement of at least $15 million per year for 2012 through 2015 related to these programs. CPSL revenues will end once NSTAR Electric has recovered its 2015-related CPSL costs. Realization of these revenues is subject to maintaining certain performance metrics over the four-year period and DPU approval. As of December 31, 2013, NSTAR Electric was in compliance with the performance metrics and has recognized the entire $15 million revenue requirement during 2013 and 2012. Basic Service Bad Debt Adder : In accordance with a generic DPU order, electric utilities in Massachusetts recover the energy-related portion of bad debt costs in their Basic Service rates. In 2007, NSTAR Electric filed its 2006 Basic Service reconciliation with the DPU proposing an adjustment related to the increase of its Basic Service bad debt charge-offs. The DPU issued an order approving the implementation of a revised Basic Service rate but instructed NSTAR Electric to reduce distribution rates by an amount equal to the increase in its Basic Service bad debt charge-offs. This adjustment to NSTAR Electric distribution rates would eliminate the fully reconciling nature of the Basic Service bad debt adder. In 2010, NSTAR Electric filed an appeal of the DPU order with the SJC. In 2012, the SJC vacated the DPU order and remanded the matter to the DPU for further review. The DPU has not taken any action on the remand. NSTAR Electric deferred approximately $34 million of costs associated with energy-related bad debt as a regulatory asset through 2011 as NSTAR Electric had concluded that it was probable that these costs would ultimately be recovered from customers. Due to delays and the duration of the proceedings, NSTAR Electric concluded that while an ultimate outcome on the matter in its favor remained "more likely than not," it could no longer be deemed "probable." As a result, NSTAR Electric recognized a reserve related to the regulatory asset in 2012. NSTAR Electric will continue to maintain the reserve until the proceeding has been concluded with the DPU. New Hampshire: Distribution Rates : In 2013, PSNH filed for a distribution rate step increase in accordance with the 2010 NHPUC approved distribution rate case settlement. On June 27, 2013, the NHPUC approved an increase to rates of $12.6 million, effective July 1, 2013. The increase consists primarily of $7.7 million related to net plant additions and a $5 million increase to the current level of funding for the Major Storm Cost reserve. ES and SCRC Rates : On December 12, 2013, PSNH filed a request with the NHPUC to adjust its ES and SCRC rates effective January 1, 2014. PSNH request proposed to increase the current ES and SCRC billing rates to reflect projected costs for 2014. On December 27, 2013, the NHPUC approved the request. The approved energy supply portion of the 2014 rate is 9.23 cents per kWh and the SCRC rate for 2014 is 0.35 cents per kWh. Clean Air Project Prudence Proceeding : The Clean Air Project, which involved the installation of wet scrubber technology at PSNH Merrimack coal-fired generation station in Bow, New Hampshire, was placed in service in September 2011. In November 2011, the NHPUC opened a docket to review the Clean Air Project, including the establishment of temporary rates for near-term recovery of Clean Air Project costs, a prudence review of PSNH's overall construction program, and establishment of permanent rates for recovery of prudently incurred Clean Air Project costs. In April 2012, the NHPUC issued an order authorizing temporary rates to recover a significant portion of the Clean Air Project costs. The docket will remain open to conduct a comprehensive prudence review of the Clean Air Project and the establishment of permanent rates. The temporary rates will remain in effect until permanent rates allowing full recovery of all prudently incurred costs are approved. At that time, the NHPUC will reconcile recoveries collected under the temporary rates with approved permanent rates. The NHPUC has issued a series of orders ruling on the scope of its Clean Air Project inquiry and discovery issues. On December 23, 2013, the NHPUC Staff and other intervenors filed testimony discussing the prudency of the Clean Air Project, which cost $421 million. Discovery is currently ongoing with hearings likely in late 2014. We continue to believe that we were prudent in the undertaking and completion of the Clean Air Project. While we cannot predict with certainty the outcome of the Clean Air Project prudence review, we believe all costs were incurred appropriately and are probable of recovery. PSNH Generation : On January 18, 2013, the NHPUC opened a docket to investigate market conditions affecting PSNH ES rate, how PSNH will maintain just and reasonable rates in light of those conditions, and any impact of PSNH generation ownership on the New Hampshire competitive electric market. On July 15, 2013, the NHPUC accepted from the NHPUC Staff a "Report on Investigation into Market Conditions, Default Service Rate, Generation Ownership and Impact on the Competitive Electricity Market." The report recommended that the NHPUC examine whether default service rates remain sustainable on a going forward basis, define "just and reasonable" with respect to default service in the context of competitive retail markets, analyze the current and expected value of PSNH generating units, and identify means to mitigate and address stranded cost recovery. 45 On September 18, 2013, the NHPUC issued a Request for Proposal to hire a valuation expert to determine the value of PSNH's generation assets and entitlements. On October 16, 2013, the State of New Hampshire Legislative Oversight Committee on Electric Utility Restructuring (Oversight Committee) requested that the NHPUC conduct an analysis to determine whether it is now in the economic interest of PSNH retail customers for PSNH to divest its interest in generation plants. On November 1, 2013, the Oversight Committee asked for a preliminary report on the findings by April 1, 2014 that would include at a minimum the NHPUC Staff position, the analysis of the valuation expert, and any recommendations for legislation that may be needed concerning divestiture or otherwise related to this issue. A valuation expert has been hired and the investigation is currently ongoing. At this time, we cannot predict the outcome of this review. Our current PSNH generation rate base totals approximately $760 million. We continue to believe all costs and generation investments are probable of recovery. Federal: EPA Proposed NPDES Permit : PSNH maintains a NPDES permit consistent with requirements of the Clean Water Act for Merrimack Station. In 1997, PSNH filed in a timely manner for a renewal of this permit. As a result, the existing permit was administratively continued. On September 29, 2011, the EPA issued a draft renewal NPDES permit for PSNH's Merrimack Station for public review and comment. The proposed permit contains many significant conditions to future operation. The proposed permit would require PSNH to install a closed-cycle cooling system (including cooling towers) at the station. The EPA estimated that the net present value cost to install this system and operate it over a 20-year period would be approximately $112 million. On October 27, 2011, the EPA extended the initial 60-day period for public review and comment on the draft permit for an additional 90 days until February 28, 2012. PSNH and other electric utility groups filed thousands of pages of comments contesting EPA draft permit requirements. PSNH stated that the data and studies supplied to the EPA demonstrate the fact that a closed-cycle cooling system is not warranted. The EPA does not have a set deadline to consider comments and to issue a final permit. Merrimack Station is permitted to continue to operate under its present permit pending issuance of the final permit and subsequent resolution of matters appealed by PSNH and other parties. Due to the site specific characteristics of PSNH's other fossil generating stations, we believe that closed-cycle cooling systems are not warranted. Legislative and Policy Matters Federal: On January 2, 2013, the "American Taxpayer Relief Act of 2012" became law, which extended the accelerated deduction of depreciation to businesses through 2013. This extended stimulus provided NU with cash flow benefits of approximately $300 million (approximately $95 million at CL&P, $85 million at NSTAR Electric, $35 million at PSNH, and $50 million at WMECO). On September 13, 2013, the Internal Revenue Service issued final Tangible Property regulations that are meant to simplify, clarify and make more administrable previously issued guidance. In the third quarter of 2013, CL&P recorded an after-tax valuation allowance of $10.5 million against its deferred tax assets as a result of these regulations. NU is in compliance with the new regulations, but continues to evaluate several new potential elections. Therefore, a change to the valuation allowance at CL&P could result once NU completes the review of the impact of the final regulations. Connecticut: In 2013, Connecticut enacted into law two significant energy bills. The first law, Public Act 13-298, implemented a number of the recommendations proposed in the CES. Public Act 13-298 authorized the filing of a plan to expand natural gas service to Connecticut residents that currently do not have access to natural gas. For further information on Yankee Gas filing, see "Regulatory Developments and Rate Matters - Connecticut - Yankee Gas Natural Gas Expansion Plan" in this Management's Discussion and Analysis. The law also required PURA to implement decoupling for each of Connecticut electric and natural gas utilities in their next respective rate cases. Finally, the law allows electric distribution companies to recover their costs as well as lost revenues from various state energy policy initiatives, including expanded energy efficiency programs. The second law, Public Act 13-303, "An Act Concerning Connecticut Clean Energy Goals," allows DEEP to conduct a process to procure from renewable energy generators, under long-term contracts with the electric distribution companies, additional renewable generation to help Connecticut meet its Renewable Portfolio Standard (RPS). Large scale hydropower facilities located in the New England Power Pool Generation Information System (NEPOOL GIS) geographic eligibility area or an area abutting the northern boundary of the NEPOOL GIS geographic eligibility area are eligible to bid into DEEP's process. If Connecticut experiences a material shortfall in reaching its RPS goals, such hydropower, under certain conditions, can be used to alleviate such shortfall, up to five percent of RPS requirements in 2020. The law also requires DEEP to develop a schedule to assign a gradually reducing renewable energy credit value for all Class I biomass or landfill generation facilities. Such reduced credit values will not apply to biogas or anaerobic digestion facilities, or to facilities that have a long-term contract in place. The commissioner of DEEP may adjust such changes to the values of renewable energy credits, if such adjustment is appropriate given the availability of other Class I renewable energy sources. On September 26, 2013, DEEP issued a final determination that authorized the state electric distribution companies to enter into long-term power purchase agreements for a total of 270 MW of Class I renewable generation from two projects. On October 23, 2013, PURA issued a final decision accepting the contracts presented by the electric distribution companies. On October 21, 2013, DEEP 46 issued a Request for Proposal seeking proposals for energy and RECs from private developers for up to 4 percent of the state electric distribution companies load (estimated to be between 100 MW to 150 MW) of Class I renewable energy resources for biomass, landfill gas and run off river hydropower projects from new or existing facilities. Massachusetts : On July 24, 2013, Massachusetts enacted a law that changed the income tax rate applicable to utility companies effective January 1, 2014, from 6.5 percent to 8 percent. The tax law change required NU to remeasure its accumulated deferred income taxes and resulted in NU increasing its deferred tax liability with an offsetting regulatory asset of approximately $61 million at its utility companies. Critical Accounting Policies The preparation of financial statements in conformity with GAAP requires management to make estimates, assumptions and, at times, difficult, subjective or complex judgments. Changes in these estimates, assumptions and judgments, in and of themselves, could materially impact our financial position, results of operations or cash flows. Our management communicates to and discusses with the Audit Committee of our Board of Trustees significant matters relating to critical accounting policies. Our critical accounting policies are discussed below. See the combined notes to our financial statements for further information concerning the accounting policies, estimates and assumptions used in the preparation of our financial statements. Regulatory Accounting: The accounting policies of the Regulated companies conform to GAAP applicable to rate-regulated enterprises and reflect the effects of the rate-making process. The application of accounting guidance for rate-regulated enterprises results in recording regulatory assets and liabilities. Regulatory assets represent the deferral of incurred costs that are probable of future recovery in customer rates Regulatory assets are amortized as the incurred costs are recovered through customer rates. In some cases, we record regulatory assets before approval for recovery has been received from the applicable regulatory commission. We must use judgment to conclude that costs deferred as regulatory assets are probable of future recovery. We base our conclusion on certain factors, including, but not limited to, regulatory precedent. Regulatory liabilities represent revenues received from customers to fund expected costs that have not yet been incurred or probable future refunds to customers. We use our best judgment when recording regulatory assets and liabilities; however, regulatory commissions can reach different conclusions about the recovery of costs, and those conclusions could have a material impact on our financial statements. We believe it is probable that the Regulated companies will recover the regulatory assets that have been recorded. If we determined that we could no longer apply the accounting guidance applicable to rate-regulated enterprises to our operations, or that we could not conclude that it is probable that costs would be recovered from customers in future rates, the costs would be charged to earnings in the period in which the determination is made. For further information, see Note 3, "Regulatory Accounting," to the financial statements. Unbilled Revenues: The determination of retail energy sales to residential, commercial and industrial customers is based on the reading of meters, which occurs regularly throughout the month. Billed revenues are based on these meter readings and the majority of recorded annual revenues is based on actual billings. Because customers are billed throughout the month based on pre-determined cycles rather than on a calendar month basis, an estimate of electricity or natural gas delivered to customers for which the customers have not yet been billed is calculated as of the balance sheet date. Unbilled revenues represent an estimate of electricity or natural gas delivered to customers but not yet billed. Unbilled revenues are included in Operating Revenues on the statement of income and are assets on the balance sheet that are reclassified to Accounts Receivable in the following month as customers are billed. Such estimates are subject to adjustment when actual meter readings become available, when there is a change in estimates and under other circumstances. The Regulated companies estimate unbilled sales monthly using the daily load cycle method. The daily load cycle method allocates billed sales to the current calendar month based on the daily load for each billing cycle. The billed sales are subtracted from total month load, net of delivery losses, to estimate unbilled sales. Unbilled revenues are estimated by first allocating unbilled sales to the respective customer classes, then applying an estimated rate by customer class to those sales. The estimate of unbilled revenues is sensitive to numerous factors, such as energy demands, weather and changes in the composition of customer classes that can significantly impact the amount of revenues recorded. For further information, see Note 1K, "Summary of Significant Accounting Policies - Revenues," to the financial statements. Pension and PBOP: NUSCO sponsors the NUSCO Pension Plan and NSTAR Electric acts as plan sponsor for the NSTAR Pension Plan, both of which cover certain of our employees. In addition, our service company sponsors the NUSCO and NSTAR PBOP plans to provide certain health care benefits, primarily medical and dental, and life insurance benefits to retired employees. For each of these plans, the development of the benefit obligation, funded status and net periodic benefit cost is based on several significant assumptions. We evaluate these assumptions at least annually and adjust them as necessary. Changes in these assumptions could have a material impact on our financial position, results of operations or cash flows. 47 Pre-tax net periodic benefit expense (excluding SERP) for the Pension Plans was $236.3 million, $234.9 million and $127.7 million for the years ended December 31, 2013, 2012 and 2011, respectively. The pre-tax net periodic benefit expense for the PBOP Plans was $32.6 million, $72.3 million and $43.6 million for the years ended December 31, 2013, 2012 and 2011, respectively. NSTAR pension and PBOP expense was included in NU beginning April 10, 2012. We develop key assumptions for purposes of measuring liabilities as of December 31 st and expenses for the subsequent year. These assumptions include the expected long-term rate of return on plan assets, discount rate, compensation/progression rate, and health care cost trend rates and are discussed below. Expected Long-Term Rate of Return on Plan Assets : In developing this assumption, we consider historical and expected returns and input from our consultants. Our expected long-term rate of return on assets is based on assumptions regarding target asset allocations and corresponding expected rates of return for each asset class. We routinely review the actual asset allocations and periodically rebalance the investments to the targeted asset allocations when appropriate. For the year ended December 31, 2013, our aggregate expected long-term rate of return assumption of 8.25 percent was used to determine our pension and PBOP expense. For the forecasted 2014 pension and PBOP expense, our expected long-term rate of return of 8.25 percent for all plans was used reflecting our target asset allocations within both the NUSCO and NSTAR Pension and PBOP Plans. Discount Rate : Payment obligations related to the Pension Plans and PBOP Plans are discounted at interest rates applicable to the expected timing of each plan cash flows. The discount rate that is utilized in determining the pension and PBOP obligations is based on a yield-curve approach. This approach is based on a population of bonds with an average rating of AA based on bond ratings by Moody s, S&P and Fitch, and uses bonds with above median yields within that population. The discount rates determined on this basis were 5.03 percent for the NUSCO Pension Plan, 4.85 percent for the NSTAR Pension Plan, 4.78 percent for the NUSCO PBOP Plans and 5.10 percent for the NSTAR PBOP Plan as of December 31, 2013. Compensation/Progression Rate : This assumption reflects the expected long-term salary growth rate, which impacts the estimated benefits that pension plan participants receive in the future. As of December 31, 2013 and 2012, we used a compensation/progression rate of 3.5 percent for the NUSCO Pension Plan and 4 percent for the NSTAR Pension Plan, which reflects our current expectation of future salary increases, including consideration of the levels of increases built into collective bargaining agreements. Actuarial Determination of Expense : Pension and PBOP expense is determined by our actuaries and consists of service cost and prior service cost, interest cost based on the discounting of the obligations, amortization of actuarial gains and losses and amortization of the net transition obligation (which was fully amortized in 2013), offset by the expected return on plan assets. Actuarial gains and losses represent differences between assumptions and actual information or updated assumptions. We determine the expected return on plan assets for the NUSCO Pension and PBOP Plans by applying our assumed rate of return to a four-year rolling average of plan asset fair values, which reduces year-to-year volatility. This calculation recognizes investment gains or losses over a four-year period from the years in which they occur. Investment gains or losses for this purpose are the difference between the calculated expected return and the actual return or loss based on the change in the fair value of assets during the year. As of December 31, 2013, investment gains and losses that remain to be reflected in the calculation of plan assets over the next four years were losses of $41.8 million and gains of $27.6 million for the NUSCO Pension Plan and PBOP Plans, respectively. As investment gains and losses are reflected in the average plan asset fair values, they are subject to amortization with other unrecognized actuarial gains or losses. The plans currently amortize unrecognized actuarial gains or losses as a component of pension and PBOP expense over the average future employee service period. As of December 31, 2013, the net unrecognized actuarial losses on the NUSCO Pension and PBOP Plan liabilities were $628.8 million and $111 million, respectively. For the NSTAR Pension and PBOP Plans, the entire difference between the actual and expected return on plan assets as of December 31, 2013 is immediately reflected as a component of unrecognized actuarial gains or losses to be amortized over the estimated average future service period of the employees. As of December 31, 2013, the net unrecognized actuarial losses on the NSTAR Pension and PBOP Plan liabilities were approximately $498 million and $12.1 million, respectively. Forecasted Expenses and Expected Contributions : Based upon the assumptions and methodologies discussed above, we estimate that the combined expense for the Pension and PBOP Plans will be $132 million and $9.1 million, respectively, in 2014. Pension and PBOP expense for subsequent years will depend on future investment performance, changes in future discount rates and other assumptions, and various other factors related to the populations participating in the plans. Pension and PBOP expense charged to earnings is net of the amounts capitalized. We expect to continue our policy to contribute to the NUSCO PBOP Plans at the amount of PBOP expense excluding any curtailments and the NSTAR PBOP Plan at an amount that approximates benefit payments. We contributed $57.6 million to the PBOP Plans in 2013 and expect to contribute $39.7 million in 2014. NU's policy is to fund the Pension Plans annually in an amount at least equal to an amount that will satisfy the federal requirements. NU made contributions to the NUSCO Pension Plan totaling $202.7 million in 2013, of which $108.3 million was contributed by PSNH. NSTAR Electric contributed $82 million to the NSTAR Pension Plan in 2013. Our Pension Plan funded ratio (the value of plan assets divided by the funding target in accordance with the requirements and guidelines of the PPA) was 94.6 percent and 96 percent as of January 1, 2013 for the NUSCO Pension Plan and NSTAR Pension Plan, respectively. We currently estimate that aggregate contributions of $71.6 million to the Pension Plans will be made in 2014. Fluctuations in the average discount rate used to calculate expected contributions to the Pension Plans can have a significant impact on the amounts. 48 Sensitivity Analysis : The following represents the hypothetical increase to the Pension Plans (excluding SERP) and PBOP Plans reported annual cost as a result of a change in the following assumptions by 50 basis points: Pension Plan Cost PBOP Plan Cost (Millions of Dollars) As of December 31, Assumption Change 2013 2012 2013 2012 NU Lower long-term rate of return $ 17.2 $ 15.0 $ 3.4 $ 3.1 Lower discount rate $ 22.3 $ 22.0 $ 6.8 $ 6.7 Higher compensation increase $ 12.4 $ 10.4 N/A N/A NSTAR Plans Lower long-term rate of return $ 5.6 $ 4.8 $ 1.8 $ 1.7 Lower discount rate $ 5.4 $ 6.8 $ 3.4 $ 4.1 Higher compensation increase $ 3.8 $ 3.6 N/A N/A Changes in pension and PBOP costs would not impact net income for the NSTAR Plans as their expenses are fully recovered in rates, which reconcile each year relative to the change in costs. Health Care Cost : The health care cost trend rate assumption used to calculate the 2013 PBOP expense amounts was 7 percent for the NUSCO PBOP Plan, subsequently decreasing by 50 basis points per year to an ultimate rate of 5 percent in 2017, and 7.10 percent for the NSTAR PBOP Plan, subsequently decreasing to an ultimate rate of 4.5 percent in 2024. As of December 31, 2013, the health care cost trend rate assumption used to determine the NUSCO and NSTAR PBOP Plans year end funded status is 7 percent, subsequently decreasing to an ultimate rate of 4.5 percent in 2024. The effect of a hypothetical increase in the health care cost trend rate by one percentage point would be an increase to the service and interest cost components of PBOP Plan expense by $7.1million in 2013, with a $85.8 million impact on the postretirement benefit obligation. See Note 10A, "Employee Benefits - Pension Benefits and Postretirement Benefits Other Than Pensions," to the financial statements for more information. Goodwill: We have recorded approximately $3.5 billion of goodwill associated with the previous mergers and acquisitions. NU has identified its reporting units for purposes of allocating and testing goodwill as Electric Distribution, Electric Transmission and Natural Gas Distribution. These reporting units are consistent with our operating segments underlying our reportable segments. Electric Distribution and Electric Transmission reporting units include carrying values for the respective components of CL&P, NSTAR Electric, PSNH and WMECO. The Natural Gas reporting unit includes the carrying values of NSTAR Gas and Yankee Gas. As of December 31, 2013, goodwill was allocated to the reporting units as follows: $2.5 billion to Electric Distribution, $0.6 billion to Electric Transmission, and $0.4 billion to Natural Gas Distribution. We are required to test goodwill balances for impairment at least annually by considering the fair value of the reporting units, which requires us to use estimates and judgments. We have selected October 1 st of each year as the annual goodwill impairment testing date. Goodwill impairment is deemed to exist if the carrying value of a reporting unit exceeds its estimated fair value and if the implied fair value of goodwill based on the estimated fair values of the reporting units assets and liabilities is less than the carrying amount of the goodwill. If goodwill were deemed to be impaired, it would be written down in the current period to the extent of the impairment. We performed an impairment test as of October 1, 2013 for the Electric Distribution, Electric Transmission and Natural Gas Distribution reporting units. This evaluation required the test of several factors that impact the fair value of the reporting units, including conditions and assumptions that affect the future cash flows of the reporting units. The 2013 goodwill impairment test resulted in a conclusion that goodwill is not impaired and none of the reporting units is at risk of a goodwill impairment. Income Taxes: Income tax expense is estimated annually for each of the jurisdictions in which we operate. This process involves estimating current and deferred income tax expense or benefit and the impact of temporary differences resulting from differing treatment of items for financial reporting and income tax return reporting purposes. Such differences are the result of timing of the deduction for expenses, as well as any impact of permanent differences, non-tax deductible expenses, or other items, including items that directly impact our tax return as a result of a regulatory activity (flow-through items). The temporary differences and flow-through items result in deferred tax assets and liabilities that are included in the balance sheets. The income tax estimation process impacts all of our segments. We record income tax expense quarterly using an estimated annualized effective tax rate. A reconciliation of expected tax expense at the statutory federal income tax rate to actual tax expense recorded is included in Note 11, "Income Taxes," to the financial statements. We also account for uncertainty in income taxes, which applies to all income tax positions previously filed in a tax return and income tax positions expected to be taken in a future tax return that have been reflected on our balance sheets. We follow generally accepted accounting principles to address the methodology to be used in recognizing, measuring and classifying the amounts associated with tax positions that are deemed to be uncertain, including related interest and penalties. The determination of whether a tax position meets the recognition threshold under this guidance is based on facts and circumstances available to us. Once a tax position meets the recognition threshold, the tax benefit is measured using a cumulative probability assessment. Assigning probabilities in measuring a recognized tax position and evaluating new information or events in subsequent periods requires significant judgment and could change previous conclusions used to measure the tax position estimate. New information or events may include tax examinations or appeals 49 (including information gained from those examinations), developments in case law, settlements of tax positions, changes in tax law and regulations, rulings by taxing authorities and statute of limitation expirations. Such information or events may have a significant impact on our financial position, results of operations and cash flows. Accounting for Environmental Reserves: Environmental reserves are accrued when assessments indicate it is probable that a liability has been incurred and an amount can be reasonably estimated. Adjustments made to estimates of environmental liabilities could have a significant impact on earnings. We estimate these liabilities based on findings through various phases of the assessment, considering the most likely action plan from a variety of available remediation options (ranging from no action required to full site remediation and long-term monitoring), current site information from our site assessments, remediation estimates from third party engineering and remediation contractors, and our prior experience in remediating contaminated sites. Our estimates incorporate currently enacted state and federal environmental laws and regulations and data released by the EPA and other organizations. The estimates associated with each possible action plan are judgmental in nature partly because there are usually several different remediation options from which to choose. Our estimates are subject to revision in future periods based on actual costs or new information from other sources, including the level of contamination at the site, the extent of our responsibility or the extent of remediation required, recently enacted laws and regulations or a change in cost estimates due to certain economic factors. For further information, see Note 12A, "Commitments and Contingencies - Environmental Matters," to the financial statements. Fair Value Measurements: We follow fair value measurement guidance that defines fair value as the price that would be received for the sale of an asset or paid to transfer a liability in an orderly transaction between market participants at the measurement date (an exit price). We have applied this guidance to our Company's derivative contracts that are recorded at fair value, marketable securities held in NU supplemental benefit trust and WMECO spent nuclear fuel trust, the marketable securities held in CYAPC's and YAEC's nuclear decommissioning trusts, our valuations of investments in our Pension and PBOP plans, and nonrecurring fair value measurements of nonfinancial assets such as goodwill and AROs. Changes in fair value of the regulated company derivative contracts are recorded as Regulatory Assets or Liabilities, as we expect to recover the costs of these contracts in rates. These valuations are sensitive to the prices of energy and energy-related products in future years for which markets have not yet developed and assumptions are made. We use quoted market prices when available to determine fair values of financial instruments. If quoted market prices are not available, fair value is determined using quoted prices for similar instruments in active markets, quoted prices for identical or similar instruments that are not active and model-derived valuations. When quoted prices in active markets for the same or similar instruments are not available, we value derivative contracts using models that incorporate both observable and unobservable inputs. Significant unobservable inputs utilized in the models include energy and energy-related product prices for future years for long-dated derivative contracts, future contract quantities under full requirements and supplemental sales contracts, and market volatilities. Discounted cash flow valuations incorporate estimates of premiums or discounts, reflecting risk adjusted profit that would be required by a market participant to arrive at an exit price, using available historical market transaction information. Valuations of derivative contracts also reflect our estimates of nonperformance risk, including credit risk.

(b) Estimated interest payments on fixed-rate debt are calculated by multiplying the coupon rate on the debt by its scheduled notional amount outstanding for the period of measurement. Estimated interest payments on floating-rate debt are calculated by multiplying the average of the 2013 floating-rate resets on the debt by its scheduled notional amount outstanding for the period of measurement. This same rate is then assumed for the remaining life of the debt. (c) The capital lease obligations include imputed interest. (d) Amounts are not included on our balance sheets. (e) Other than the net mark-to-market changes on derivative contracts held by the Regulated companies, these obligations are not included on our balance sheets. (f) Does not include unrecognized tax benefits as of December 31, 2013, as we cannot make reasonable estimates of the periods or the potential amounts of cash settlement with the respective taxing authorities. Also does not include an NU contingent commitment of approximately $38.1 million to an energy investment fund, which would be invested under certain conditions, as we cannot make reasonable estimates of the periods or the investment contributions. (g) Amount represents open purchase orders, excluding those obligations that are included in the capital leases, operating leases and estimated future annual long-term contractual costs. These payments are subject to change as certain purchase orders include estimates based on projected quantities of material and/or services that are provided on demand, the timing of which cannot be determined. Because payment timing cannot be determined, we include all open purchase order amounts in 2014. (h) These amounts represent NU's estimated minimum pension contributions to its qualified Pension Plans required under federal legislation. Contributions in 2015 through 2018 and thereafter will vary depending on many factors, including the performance of existing plan assets, valuation of the plan's liabilities and long-term discount rates, and are subject to change. (i) Excludes other long-term liabilities, including the unrecognized tax benefits described above, deferred contractual obligations, environmental reserves, employee medical insurance and other reserves ($26.7 million at NU and $13.5 million at CL&P), workers compensation and long-term disability insurance reserves ($43.3 million at NU and $21.5 million at CL&P) and the ARO liability reserves as we cannot make reasonable estimates of the timing of payments.

The year ended December 31, 2012 amounts include the operations of NSTAR beginning April 10, 2012: Comparison of 2013 to 2012 : Operating Revenues and Expenses For the Years Ended December 31, (Millions of Dollars) 2013 2012 (a) Increase/ Percent (Decrease) Operating Revenues $ 7,301.2 $ 6,273.8 $ 1,027.4 16.4 % Operating Expenses: Purchased Power, Fuel and Transmission 2,483.0 2,084.4 398.6 19.1 Operations and Maintenance 1,515.0 1,583.1 (68.1) (4.3) Depreciation 610.8 519.0 91.8 17.7 Amortization of Regulatory Assets, Net 206.3 79.8 126.5 (b) Amortization of Rate Reduction Bonds 42.6 142.0 (99.4) (70.0) Energy Efficiency Programs 401.9 313.1 88.8 28.4 Taxes Other Than Income Taxes 512.2 434.2 78.0 18.0 Total Operating Expenses 5,771.8 5,155.6 616.2 12.0 Operating Income $ 1,529.4 $ 1,118.2 $ 411.2 36.8 % (a) The 2012 results include the operations of NSTAR beginning April 10, 2012. (b) Percent greater than 100 percent not shown as it is not meaningful. Operating Revenues For the Years Ended December 31, (Millions of Dollars) 2013 2012 (a) Increase/ (Decrease) Percent Electric Distribution $ 5,362.3 $ 4,716.5 $ 645.8 13.7 % Natural Gas Distribution 855.8 572.9 282.9 49.4 Total Distribution 6,218.1 5,289.4 928.7 17.6 Transmission 978.7 861.5 117.2 13.6 Total Regulated Companies 7,196.8 6,150.9 1,045.9 17.0 Other and Eliminations 104.4 122.9 (18.5) (15.1) Total Operating Revenues $ 7,301.2 $ 6,273.8 $ 1,027.4 16.4 % (a) The 2012 results include the operations of NSTAR beginning April 10, 2012. A summary of our retail electric sales and firm natural gas sales were as follows: For the Years Ended December 31, 2013 2012 (a) Increase Percent Retail Electric Sales in GWh 55,331 54,808 523 1.0 % Firm Natural Gas Sales in Million Cubic Feet 98,258 87,527 10,731 12.3 % (a) Results include retail electric sales of NSTAR Electric and the firm natural gas sales of NSTAR Gas from January 1, 2012 through December 31, 2012 for comparative purposes only. Our Operating Revenues increased in 2013, as compared to 2012, due primarily to the addition of NSTAR's operations. During the first quarter of 2013, the former operating subsidiaries of NSTAR contributed approximately $800 million of operating revenues. Absent the first quarter 2013 NSTAR operating revenues, our Operating Revenues increased approximately $227 million due primarily to: A $62.5 million increase in transmission revenues, net of applicable eliminations, as a result of the recovery of higher transmission expenses and continuing investments in our transmission infrastructure. The increase was partially offset by the establishment of a reserve related to the FERC ALJ initial decision in the third quarter of 2013. A $34.3 million increase in base electric distribution revenues, net of applicable eliminations, reflecting an increase of approximately 1 percent in retail electric sales. The increase in sales volumes was driven primarily by the colder winter weather experienced throughout our service territories in early and late 2013. In addition, the increase in revenues resulted from the NHPUC-approved distribution rate increases at PSNH effective July 1, 2012 and July 1, 2013 as a result of the 2010 distribution rate case settlement. These positive impacts on revenue were partially offset by the impact of our company-sponsored energy efficiency programs. 52 A $28.8 million increase in firm natural gas distribution revenues. This increase was driven by the colder winter weather in early and late 2013, residential customer growth, an increase in natural gas conversions, the migration of interruptible customers switching to firm service rates and the addition of gas-fired distributed generation. The remaining increase was due primarily to higher revenues from our tracker mechanisms related to the recovery of energy supply, retail transmission and company-sponsored energy efficiency programs. Revenues related to cost recovery mechanisms vary from period to period based on the timing of collections of the costs incurred. These revenues had no material impact on earnings. Purchased Power, Fuel and Transmission increased in 2013, as compared to 2012, due primarily to the following: 2013 Increase/(Decrease) (Millions of Dollars) Compared to 2012 The addition of NSTAR's operations $ 321.4 Transmission segment costs 70.8 Firm natural gas sales related costs 42.0 Partially offset by: Electric distribution segment fuel and energy supply costs (13.9) CfDs and capacity contracts (12.0) All other items (9.7) $ 398.6 Operations and Maintenance decreased in 2013, as compared to 2012, due primarily to the following: (Millions of Dollars) Increase/(Decrease) The addition of NSTAR operations $ 123.6 Partially offset by: Integration, merger and settlement agreement costs (150.3) NU unregulated contracting business costs (17.4) General and administrative costs (12.9) Transmission segment costs (5.2) Natural gas segment costs 10.5 Electric distribution segment costs 1.3 All other items (17.7) $ (68.1) Depreciation increased in 2013, as compared to 2012, due primarily to the addition of NSTAR ($54.2 million) and the consolidation of CYAPC and YAEC ($13.7 million). Excluding the impact of NSTAR and the consolidation of CYAPC and YAEC, depreciation increased due primarily to higher utility plant balances resulting from completed construction projects placed into service. Amortization of Regulatory Assets, Net increased in 2013, as compared to 2012, due primarily to the following: (Millions of Dollars) Increase/(Decrease) The addition of NSTAR operations $ 45.8 Recovery of transition costs at NSTAR Electric 91.9 Amortization related to CL&P SBC and CTA (6.8) Other (4.4) $ 126.5 Amortization of Rate Reduction Bonds decreased in 2013, as compared to 2012, due primarily to the maturity of NSTAR Electric's, PSNH's, and WMECO's RRBs in 2013, partially offset by the addition of NSTAR Electric amortization ($15.1 million). Energy Efficiency Programs increased in 2013, as compared to 2012, due primarily to the addition of NSTAR's operations ($68.6 million), as well as an increase in energy efficiency costs in accordance with the three-year program guidelines established by the DPU at NSTAR Electric and WMECO. All costs are fully recovered through DPU-approved tracking mechanisms and therefore do not impact earnings. Taxes Other Than Income Taxes increased in 2013, as compared to 2012, due primarily to the addition of NSTAR's operations ($37.8 million). In addition, there was an increase in property taxes ($36.6 million) as a result of an increase in Property, Plant and Equipment and an increase in the property tax rates, and an increase in the Connecticut gross earnings tax ($9.1 million) attributable to an increase in gross earnings. Interest Expense increased $8.8 million in 2013, as compared to 2012, due primarily to the addition of NSTAR operations ($22 million) and lower interest income on deferred transition costs ($10.6 million), partially offset by a decrease in Other Interest due primarily to the favorable impact from the resolution of a state income tax audit in the first quarter of 2013, lower interest on short-term debt ($8.8 million) and lower interest on RRBs ($6.1 million). 53 Other Income, Net increased $10.2 million in 2013, as compared to 2012, due primarily to higher gains on the NU supplemental benefit trust ($6 million) and an increase related to officer insurance policies ($1.7 million). Income Tax Expense For the Years Ended December 31, (Millions of Dollars) 2013 2012 (a) Increase Percent Income Tax Expense $ 426.9 $ 274.9 $ 152.0 55.3 % (a) The 2012 results include the operations of NSTAR beginning April 10, 2012. Income Tax Expense increased in 2013, as compared to 2012, due primarily to higher pre-tax earnings ($81 million), the absence in 2013 of both prior year Connecticut and Massachusetts merger settlement agreement impacts ($41 million) and integration merger impacts ($23 million), along with various other items ($7 million). Comparison of 2012 to 2011 : Operating Revenues and Expenses For the Years Ended December 31, (Millions of Dollars) 2012 (a) 2011 Increase/ Percent (Decrease) Operating Revenues $ 6,273.8 $ 4,465.7 $ 1,808.1 40.5 % Operating Expenses: Purchased Power, Fuel and Transmission 2,084.4 1,657.9 426.5 25.7 Operations and Maintenance 1,583.1 1,095.4 487.7 44.5 Depreciation 519.0 302.2 216.8 71.7 Amortization of Regulatory Assets, Net 79.8 91.1 (11.3) (12.4) Amortization of Rate Reduction Bonds 142.0 69.9 72.1 (b) Energy Efficiency Programs 313.1 131.4 181.7 (b) Taxes Other Than Income Taxes 434.2 323.6 110.6 34.2 Total Operating Expenses 5,155.6 3,671.5 1,484.1 40.4 Operating Income $ 1,118.2 $ 794.2 $ 324.0 40.8 % (a) The 2012 results include the operations of NSTAR beginning April 10, 2012.

(b) Percent greater than 100 percent not shown as it is not meaningful. A summary of our retail electric sales and firm natural gas sales were as follows: For the Years Ended December 31, 2012 (a) 2011 Increase Percent Retail Electric Sales in GWh 49,718 33,812 15,906 47.0 % Firm Natural Gas Sales in Million Cubic Feet 69,894 46,880 23,014 49.1 % (a) Includes the retail electric and firm natural gas sales of NSTAR beginning April 10, 2012. Our Operating Revenues increased in 2012, as compared to 2011, due primarily to the addition of NSTAR, which included electric distribution revenues of approximately $1.7 billion, transmission revenues of approximately $50 million, natural gas revenues of approximately $200 million and other revenues of approximately $15 million, and the consolidation of CYAPC and YAEC revenues of approximately $40 million. Excluding the impact of NSTAR's operations and the consolidation of CYAPC and YAEC, our Operating Revenues decreased due to the following: Lower electric distribution segment revenues related to the portions that are included in regulatory commission approved tracking mechanisms that recover certain incurred costs and do not impact earnings. The tracking mechanisms allow for rates to be changed periodically with overcollections refunded to customers or undercollections recovered from customers in future 54 periods. The tracked electric distribution revenues decreased due primarily to lower energy and supply-related costs ($241.8 million), lower CL&P CTA revenues ($46.3 million), lower wholesale revenues ($44.4 million), lower retail transmission revenues ($17.8 million), partially offset by higher CL&P FMCC delivery-related revenues ($82.4 million), higher SCRC revenues at PSNH ($34.2 million) and higher CL&P retail SBC revenues ($22.5 million). A decrease in natural gas segment revenues due primarily to a 4.3 percent decrease in Yankee Gas' sales volume related to the warmer than normal weather in the heating season of 2012, as compared to the heating season of 2011. In addition, there was a decrease in the cost of natural gas, which is fully recovered in revenues from sales to our customers. Partially offset by: Improved transmission segment revenues resulting from a higher level of investment in transmission infrastructure and the recovery of higher overall expenses, which are tracked and result in a related increase in revenues. The increase in expenses is directly related to the increase in transmission plant, primarily at WMECO, including costs associated with higher property taxes, depreciation and operation and maintenance expenses. An increase at PSNH related to the sale of oil to a third party ($20.8 million) in the second quarter of 2012, resulting in a benefit to customers through lower ES rates that does not impact earnings. The portion of electric distribution segment revenues that impacts earnings increased $8.8 million due primarily to CL&P regulatory incentives of $11.5 million and C&LM incentives of $6.2 million at CL&P, partially offset by a decrease in retail electric sales related to the warmer than normal winter weather in 2012, as compared to the winter of 2011. Purchased Power, Fuel and Transmission increased in 2012, as compared to 2011, due primarily to the following: 2012 Increase/(Decrease) (Millions of Dollars) Compared to 2011 The addition of NSTAR's operations $ 640.0 Lower GSC supply costs, partially offset by higher CfD costs at CL&P (124.3) Lower natural gas costs and lower sales at Yankee Gas (45.4) Lower purchased transmission costs and lower Basic Service costs at WMECO (25.4) Lower purchased power costs, partially offset by higher transmission costs at PSNH (8.6) All other items (9.8) $ 426.5 Operations and Maintenance increased in 2012, as compared to 2011, due primarily to the addition of NSTAR's operations, which included operating expenses of $320.8 million and maintenance expense of $50.4 million. Excluding the impact of NSTAR's operations, Operations and Maintenance increased due primarily to: Higher NU parent and other companies' expenses ($70.1 million) that were due primarily to the increase in costs related to the completion of NU merger with NSTAR ($55.9 million) and higher costs at NU unregulated contracting business related to an increased level of work in 2012 ($16.3 million). The establishment of a reserve related to major storm restoration costs ($40 million) at CL&P and bill credits to customers at CL&P and WMECO ($25 million and $3 million, respectively) as a result of the Connecticut and Massachusetts settlement agreements. In addition, there were higher electric distribution business expenses ($31.6 million) mainly as a result of general and administrative expenses primarily related to higher pension costs. Partially offsetting these increases was the absence in 2012 of the storm fund reserve established in 2011 to provide bill credits to residential customers as a result of the October 2011 snowstorm and to provide contributions to certain Connecticut charitable organizations ($30 million) at CL&P, a decrease in the amortization of the regulatory deferral allowed in the 2010 rate case decision ($21.4 million) at CL&P and lower maintenance costs at PSNH generation business due to less planned outage maintenance in 2012 ($17.8 million). Depreciation increased in 2012, as compared to 2011, due primarily to the addition of NSTAR's utility plant balances ($148.4 million) and an increase as a result of the consolidation of CYAPC and YAEC ($40.3 million). Excluding the impact of NSTAR and the consolidation of CYAPC and YAEC, Depreciation increased due primarily to higher utility plant balances resulting from completed construction projects placed into service. Amortization of Regulatory Assets, Net decreased in 2012, as compared to 2011, due primarily to a decrease in ES and TCAM amortization at PSNH ($46.9 million and $20.2 million, respectively), and higher CTA transition costs ($21.5 million) and lower CTA revenues ($46.3 million) at CL&P. Partially offsetting these decreases was an increase related to the addition of NSTAR's operations ($87.5 million), lower SBC costs ($7.6 million) and higher retail SBC revenues ($22.5 million) at CL&P, and an increase in SCRC amortization at PSNH ($13.5 million). Amortization of RRBs increased in 2012, as compared to 2011, due primarily to the addition of NSTAR Electric amortization ($67.7 million). 55 Energy Efficiency Programs increased in 2012, as compared to 2011, due primarily to the addition of NSTAR's operations ($169.4 million). In addition, there was an increase in expenses at WMECO attributable to an increase in spending in accordance with DPU approved energy efficiency programs. The increase in energy efficiency spending is recovered in rates and therefore does not impact earnings. Taxes Other Than Income Taxes increased in 2012, as compared to 2011, due primarily to the addition of NSTAR's operations ($96.4 million). In addition, there was an increase in property taxes as a result of an increase in Property, Plant and Equipment related to our regulated capital programs and an increase in the property tax rates. Interest Expense For the Years Ended December 31, Increase/ (Millions of Dollars) 2012 (a) 2011 (Decrease) Percent Interest on Long-Term Debt $ 316.9 $ 231.6 $ 85.3 36.8 % Interest on RRBs 6.2 8.6 (2.4) (27.9) Other Interest 6.8 10.2 (3.4) (33.3) $ 329.9 $ 250.4 $ 79.5 31.7 % (a) The 2012 results include the operations of NSTAR beginning April 10, 2012. Interest Expense increased in 2012, as compared to 2011, due primarily to the addition of NSTAR's operations ($70.6 million). The additional increase in Interest on Long-Term Debt was a result of the $260 million in new long-term debt issuances in September 2011 and higher short-term borrowings resulting in higher interest expense. Other Income, Net decreased in 2012, as compared to 2011, due primarily to lower AFUDC related to equity funds at PSNH as the Clean Air Project was placed into service in September 2011, partially offset by net gains on the NU supplemental benefit trust in 2012, compared to net losses in 2011. Income Tax Expense For the Years Ended December 31, (Millions of Dollars) 2012 (a) 2011 Increase Percent Income Tax Expense $ 274.9 $ 171.0 $ 103.9 60.8 % (a) The 2012 results include the operations of NSTAR beginning April 10, 2012. Income Tax Expense increased in 2012, as compared to 2011, due primarily to higher pre-tax earnings ($141.4 million), less favorable adjustments for prior year taxes ($21.3 million) and lower items that directly impact our tax return as a result of regulatory actions (flow-through items) ($3.4 million), partially offset by Connecticut and Massachusetts settlement agreement impacts ($41 million) and merger impacts ($19.9 million). 56 RESULTS OF OPERATIONS THE CONNECTICUT LIGHT AND POWER COMPANY The following provides the amounts and variances in operating revenues and expense line items for the statements of income for CL&P included in this Annual Report on Form 10-K for the years ended December 31, 2013, 2012, and 2011: Comparison of 2013 to 2012 : Operating Revenues and Expenses For the Years Ended December 31, (Millions of Dollars) 2013 2012 Increase/ Percent (Decrease) Operating Revenues $ 2,442.3 $ 2,407.4 $ 34.9 1.4 % Operating Expenses: Purchased Power and Transmission 872.8 858.2 14.6 1.7 Operations and Maintenance 523.2 635.7 (112.5) (17.7) Depreciation 177.6 166.9 10.7 6.4 Amortization of Regulatory Assets, Net 4.9 14.4 (9.5) (66.0) Energy Efficiency Programs 89.8 89.3 0.5 0.6 Taxes Other Than Income Taxes 234.4 215.9 18.5 8.6 Total Operating Expenses 1,902.7 1,980.4 (77.7) (3.9) Operating Income $ 539.6 $ 427.0 $ 112.6 26.4 % Operating Revenues CL&P's retail sales were as follows: For the Years Ended December 31, 2013 2012 Increase Percent Retail Sales in GWh 22,404 22,109 295 1.3 % CL&P Operating Revenues increased in 2013, as compared to 2012, due primarily to: A $15.8 million increase in transmission revenues reflecting recovery of higher transmission expenses and continuing transmission infrastructure investments. The increase was partially offset by the establishment of a reserve related to the FERC ALJ initial decision in the third quarter of 2013. A $13.5 million increase in base distribution revenues reflecting a 1.3 percent increase in retail sales. This increase was due primarily to the colder winter weather experienced in early and late 2013. The remaining $5.6 million increase was due primarily to higher collections of costs through reconciling cost mechanisms. These revenues are fully reconciled to the related costs. Therefore this increase in revenues had no impact on earnings. Purchased Power and Transmission increased in 2013, as compared to 2012, due primarily to the following: 2013 Increase/(Decrease) (Millions of Dollars) Compared to 2012 Transmission Costs $ 45.8 Deferred Fuel Costs 28.7 GSC Supply Costs (44.2) Purchased Power Contracts (12.1) CfD Costs (7.3) Other 3.7 $ 14.6 The increase in transmission costs was the result of an increase in the retail transmission deferral, which related rates are adjusted on an annual basis as a result of collecting or refunding costs of the transmission systems to customers. The decrease in GSC supply costs was due primarily to lower average supply prices. On July 1, 2013, CL&P began to procure approximately thirty percent of GSC load. Costs associated with the remaining seventy percent of the GSC load are the contractual amounts CL&P must pay to various suppliers that have been awarded the right to supply SS and LRS load through a competitive solicitation process. Purchased Power and Transmission costs are included in regulatory-approved tracking mechanisms and do not impact earnings. Operations and Maintenance decreased in 2013, as compared to 2012, due primarily to the absence in 2013 of costs recognized in the second quarter of 2012 as a result of the Connecticut merger settlement agreement (which established a $40 million storm fund reserve and provided a $25 million bill credit to customers). In addition, there were lower distribution operating costs ($10.2 million), the absence in 2013 of amortization of the PBOP transition obligation ($6.1 million), lower distribution general and administrative costs ($7.5 million) and lower distribution costs related to customer Energy Independence Act incentives ($6.3 million). These lower costs were partially offset by an increase in distribution routine maintenance and storm-related costs ($7.4 million). 57 Depreciation increased in 2013, as compared to 2012, due primarily to higher utility plant balances resulting from completed construction projects placed into service. Amortization of Regulatory Assets, Net decreased in 2013, as compared to 2012, due primarily to a lower net SBC deferral, partially offset by a higher net CTA deferral. SBC revenues were $23 million lower in 2013, as compared to 2012, partially offset by higher hardship program costs of $6.6 million in 2013. CTA revenues were $13.9 million higher in 2013, as compared to 2012, and costs were $30.5 million lower in 2013, as compared to 2012. DOE refunds of $21.6 million were returned to customers in the second half of 2013. Taxes Other Than Income Taxes increased in 2013, as compared to 2012, due primarily to an increase in property taxes as a result of an increase in Property, Plant and Equipment and an increase in the property tax rates ($11.5 million). In addition, there was an increase in the Connecticut gross earnings tax attributable to an increase in gross earnings ($7.6 million). Interest Expense increased $0.5 million in 2013, as compared to 2012, due primarily to higher interest on long-term debt ($5.7 million), partially offset by a decrease in other interest as a result of a favorable impact from the resolution of a state income tax audit in the first quarter of 2013 ($5.4 million). Other Income increased $4.8 million in 2013, as compared to 2012, due primarily to higher gains on the NU supplemental benefit trust. Income Tax Expense For the Years Ended December 31, (Millions of Dollars) 2013 2012 Increase Percent Income Tax Expense $ 141.7 $ 94.4 $ 47.3 50.1 % Income Tax Expense increased in 2013, as compared to 2012, due primarily to higher pre-tax earnings ($17.1 million), the absence in 2013 of the impact of costs recognized as a result of the Connecticut merger settlement agreement ($26.6 million), and higher state taxes ($5.7 million), partially offset by various other items ($2.1 million). 58 Comparison of 2012 to 2011 : Operating Revenues and Expenses For the Years Ended December 31, Increase/ (Millions of Dollars) 2012 2011 (Decrease) Percent Operating Revenues $ 2,407.4 $ 2,548.4 $ (141.0) (5.5) % Operating Expenses: Purchased Power and Transmission 858.2 982.5 (124.3) (12.7) Operations and Maintenance 635.7 580.7 55.0 9.5 Depreciation 166.9 157.8 9.1 5.8 Amortization of Regulatory Assets, Net 14.4 61.0 (46.6) (76.4) Energy Efficiency Programs 89.3 90.3 (1.0) (1.1) Taxes Other Than Income Taxes 215.9 212.9 3.0 1.4 Total Operating Expenses 1,980.4 2,085.2 (104.8) (5.0) Operating Income $ 427.0 $ 463.2 $ (36.2) (7.8) % Operating Revenues CL&P's retail sales were as follows: For the Years Ended December 31, 2012 2011 Decrease Percent Retail Sales in GWh 22,109 22,315 (206) (0.9) % CL&P's Operating Revenues decreased in 2012, as compared to 2011, due primarily to: A $133.6 million decrease in distribution revenues related to the portions that are included in PURA approved tracking mechanisms that recover certain incurred costs and do not impact earnings. The tracking mechanisms allow for rates to be changed periodically with overcollections refunded to customers or undercollections recovered from customers in future periods. The tracked distribution revenues decreased due primarily to lower GSC and FMCC supply-related revenues ($150.8 million), lower CTA revenues ($46.3 million), lower wholesale revenues ($33.5 million), and lower retail transmission revenues ($4.3 million). The lower GSC and FMCC supply-related revenues were due primarily to lower customer rates resulting from lower average supply prices and lower sales related to additional customer migration to third party electric suppliers in 2012. Partially offsetting these decreases were higher FMCC delivery-related revenues ($82.4 million) and higher retail SBC revenues ($22.5 million). Partially offset by: A $7.6 million increase in the portion of distribution revenues that impacts earnings in 2012, compared to 2011, due primarily to regulatory incentives of $11.5 million and C&LM incentives of $6.2 million, partially offset by lower sales volume related to warmer than normal winter weather in 2012, as compared to the winter of 2011. A $7.2 million increase in transmission revenues resulting from an increased level of investment in transmission infrastructure and the recovery of higher overall expenses, which are subject to tracking mechanisms or processes (tracked) and result in a related increase in revenues. The increase in expenses is directly related to the increase in transmission plant, including costs associated with higher property taxes, depreciation and operation and maintenance expenses. Purchased Power and Transmission decreased in 2012, as compared to 2011, due primarily to the following: 2012 Increase/(Decrease) (Millions of Dollars) Compared to 2011 GSC Supply Costs $ (112.0) Deferred Fuel Costs (33.4) Transmission Costs (26.8) Purchased Power Contracts (19.4) CfD Costs 70.7 Other (3.4) $ (124.3) The decrease in GSC supply costs was due to lower average supply prices and lower sales. The lower sales were due primarily to additional customer migration to third party electric suppliers. These GSC supply costs are the contractual amounts CL&P must pay to various suppliers that have been awarded the right to supply SS and LRS load through a competitive solicitation process. Purchased Power and Transmission costs are included in regulatory-approved tracking mechanisms and do not impact earnings. Operations and Maintenance increased in 2012, as compared to 2011, due primarily to the establishment of a reserve related to major storm restoration costs ($40 million) and a bill credit to customers ($25 million) in the second quarter of 2012 as a result of the Connecticut settlement agreement . In addition, there were higher distribution business expenses as a result of higher general and administrative expenses primarily related to an increase in pension costs ($20.2 million) and higher routine distribution maintenance ($19.4 million). There were also higher distribution costs related to customer Energy Independence Act incentives, which are tracked 59 and fully recoverable through tracking mechanisms ($6.5 million). Partially offsetting these increases was the absence in 2012 of the storm fund reserve established in 2011 to provide bill credits to residential customers as a result of the October 2011 snowstorm ($30 million) and a decrease in the amortization of the regulatory deferral allowed in the 2010 rate case decision ($21.4 million). Depreciation increased in 2012, as compared to 2011, due primarily to higher utility plant balances resulting from completed construction projects placed into service. Amortization of Regulatory Assets, Net decreased in 2012, as compared to 2011, due primarily to higher CTA transition costs ($21.5 million) and lower CTA revenues ($46.3 million). Partially offsetting these impacts were lower SBC costs ($7.6 million) and higher retail SBC revenues ($22.5 million). Interest Expense For the Years Ended December 31, Increase/ (Millions of Dollars) 2012 2011 (Decrease) Percent Interest on Long-Term Debt $ 124.9 $ 131.9 $ (7.0) (5.3) % Other Interest 8.2 0.8 7.4 (a) $ 133.1 $ 132.7 $ 0.4 0.3 % (a) Percent greater than 100 percent not shown since it is not meaningful. Interest on Long-Term Debt decreased in 2012, as compared to 2011, due primarily to the refinancing of the PCRBs at a lower interest rate in October 2011. Other Interest increased in 2012, as compared to 2011, due primarily to the absence of tax-related benefits recognized in 2011 and an increase in short-term borrowings resulting in higher interest expense. Income Tax Expense For the Years Ended December 31, (Millions of Dollars) 2012 2011 Increase Percent Income Tax Expense $ 94.4 $ 90.0 $ 4.4 4.9 % Income Tax Expense increased in 2012, as compared to 2011, due primarily to less favorable adjustments for prior year taxes ($22.4 million), an increase to pre-tax earnings ($13.8 million), partially offset by Connecticut settlement agreement impacts ($26.6 million), and lower state tax and other impacts ($5.2 million). EARNINGS SUMMARY For the Years Ended December 31, (Millions of Dollars) 2013 2012 Income Before Merger-Related Costs $ 279.4 $ 248.1 Merger-Related Costs (after-tax) (1) - (38.4) Net Income $ 279.4 $ 209.7 (1) The 2012 after-tax merger-related costs consisted of charges related to the Connecticut merger settlement agreement, including $14.8 million ($25 million pre-tax) for customer bill credits and $23.6 million ($40 million pre-tax) whereby CL&P agreed to forego recovery of deferred storm costs associated with Tropical Storm Irene and the October 2011 snowstorm. Excluding the impact of merger-related costs, CL&P earnings increased $31.3 million in 2013, as compared to 2012, due primarily to lower overall operations and maintenance costs and higher retail electric sales due primarily to colder weather in the first and fourth quarters of 2013. Partially offsetting these favorable earnings impacts was the establishment of a $7.7 million after-tax reserve related to the August 2013 FERC ALJ initial decision, higher depreciation and property tax expense. LIQUIDITY CL&P had cash flows provided by operating activities of $495.3 million in 2013, compared with $211.9 million in 2012. The improved cash flows were due primarily to a decrease of approximately $75 million in cash disbursements for storm restoration costs associated primarily with Tropical Storm Irene and the October 2011 snowstorm, the absence of approximately $27 million in 2012 CL&P customer bill credits associated with the October 2011 snowstorm and the absence of $25 million in 2012 CL&P customer bill credits associated with the Connecticut settlement agreement. In addition, operating cash flows benefitted from an increase in regulatory overrecoveries where such revenues exceeded costs resulting in a favorable cash flow impact, higher net income and timing of payables. Partially offsetting improved cash flows were income tax payments of $55 million in 2013, compared with income tax refunds of $42 million in 2012. CL&P had cash flows provided by operating activities of $211.9 million in 2012, compared with cash flows provided by operating activities of $513.3 million in 2011. The reduced cash flows were due primarily to the $223.1 million of cash disbursements for storm restoration costs primarily associated with Tropical Storm Irene, the October 2011 snowstorm, and Hurricane Sandy made in 2012, as compared to approximately $132 million in 2011, the $27 million in bill credits provided to residential customers in February 2012 60 related to the October 2011 snowstorm, the $25 million in bill credits to customers associated with the Connecticut merger settlement agreement, and changes in traditional working capital amounts principally due to the changes in the timing of payments of accounts payable and accrued liabilities. In addition, CL&P had lower recovery of its deferred operation and maintenance costs of $23.1 million in 2012, as compared to 2011, a negative cash flow impact of $38.9 million resulting from changes in reserves for transmission refunds in 2012, as compared to 2011, and a decrease in income tax refunds of $14.6 million in 2012, as compared to 2011. Investments in Property, Plant and Equipment on the accompanying statements of cash flows do not include amounts incurred on capital projects but not yet paid, cost of removal, AFUDC related to equity funds, and the capitalized portions of pension expense. CL&P investments totaled $434.9 million in 2013, compared with $449.1 million in 2012. On January 15, 2013, CL&P issued $400 million of 2.5 percent 2013 Series A First and Refunding Mortgage Bonds, due to mature in 2023. The proceeds, net of issuance costs, were used to pay short-term borrowings outstanding under the CL&P credit agreement of $89 million and intercompany loans related to our commercial paper program of $305.8 million. On September 3, 2013, CL&P redeemed at par $125 million of 1.25 percent Series B 2011 PCRBs, which were subject to mandatory tender for purchase, using short-term debt. On July 31, 2013, the FERC granted authorization allowing CL&P to incur total short-term borrowings up to a maximum of $600 million, effective January 1, 2014 through December 31, 2015. On September 6, 2013, NU parent and certain of its subsidiaries, including CL&P, amended their joint five-year $1.15 billion revolving credit facility, dated July 25, 2012, by increasing the aggregate principal amount available thereunder by $300 million to $1.45 billion, extending the expiration date from July 25, 2017 to September 6, 2018, and increasing CL&P's borrowing sub-limit from $300 million to $600 million. Simultaneously, effective September 6, 2013, the CL&P $300 million revolving credit facility was terminated. The revolving credit facility is to be used primarily to backstop the commercial paper program at NU. The commercial paper program allows NU parent to issue commercial paper as a form of short-term debt with intercompany loans to certain subsidiaries, including CL&P. As of December 31, 2013, CL&P had an intercompany loan payable to NU parent of $287.3 million related to our commercial paper program. Other financing activities in 2013 included $152 million in common stock dividends to NU parent and a $40 million capital contribution from NU parent. CL&P uses its available capital resources to fund its construction expenditures, meet debt requirements, pay operating costs, including storm-related costs, pay dividends and fund other corporate obligations. The current growth in CL&P transmission construction expenditures utilizes a significant amount of cash for projects that have a long-term return on investment and recovery period. In addition, CL&P recovers its distribution construction expenditures as the related project costs are depreciated over the life of the assets. As well, the future recovery of its deferred major storm costs will take place over an extended period of time. This impacts the timing of the revenue stream designed to fully recover the total investment plus a return on the equity portion of the cost and related financing costs. These factors have resulted in current liabilities exceeding current assets by approximately $398 million as of December 31, 2013. As of December 31, 2013, $150 million of CL&P's obligations classified as current liabilities relates to long-term debt that will be paid in the next 12 months. CL&P, with its strong credit ratings, has several options available in the financial markets to repay or refinance these maturities with the issuance of new long-term debt. CL&P will reduce its short-term borrowings with cash received from operating cash flows or with the issuance of new long-term debt, determined considering capital requirements and maintenance of CL&P credit rating and profile. Management expects the future operating cash flows of CL&P, along with the access to financial markets, will be sufficient to meet any future operating requirements and capital investment forecasted opportunities. 61 RESULTS OF OPERATIONS NSTAR ELECTRIC COMPANY AND SUBSIDIARY The following table provides the amounts and variances in operating revenues and expense line items for the consolidated statements of income for NSTAR Electric included in this Annual Report on Form 10-K for the years ended December 31, 2013 and 2012: Operating Revenues and Expenses For the Years Ended December 31, (Millions of Dollars) 2013 2012 Increase/ Percent (Decrease) Operating Revenues $ 2,493.5 $ 2,301.0 $ 192.5 8.4 % Operating Expenses: Purchased Power and Transmission 849.1 788.3 60.8 7.7 Operations and Maintenance 376.4 431.8 (55.4) (12.8) Depreciation 180.3 171.1 9.2 5.4 Amortization of Regulatory Assets, Net 230.1 117.7 112.4 95.5 Amortization of Rate Reduction Bonds 15.1 90.3 (75.2) (83.3) Energy Efficiency Programs 206.5 201.2 5.3 2.6 Taxes Other Than Income Taxes 127.8 119.2 8.6 7.2 Total Operating Expenses 1,985.3 1,919.6 65.7 3.4 Operating Income $ 508.2 $ 381.4 $ 126.8 33.2 % Operating Revenues NSTAR Electric's retail sales were as follows: For the Years Ended December 31, 2013 2012 Increase Percent Retail Sales in GWh 21,306 21,209 97 0.5 % NSTAR Electric's Operating Revenues increased in 2013, as compared to 2012, due primarily to: A $160.1 million increase related to a higher level of collections of energy supply and company-sponsored energy efficiency programs. These revenues are fully reconciled to their respective costs. Therefore this increase in revenues had no material impact on earnings. A $24.7 million increase in transmission revenues reflecting recovery of higher regional transmission expenses and continuing transmission infrastructure investments, offset by the establishment of a reserve related to the FERC ALJ initial decision in the third quarter of 2013. A $7.7 million increase in base distribution revenues reflecting a 0.5 percent increase in retail sales. The increase in sales volume was due primarily to a greater number of cooling degree days during the summer of 2013 and heating degree days in early and late 2013. This favorable impact was partially offset by reductions due to NSTAR Electric customer funded energy efficiency programs. Purchased Power and Transmission increased in 2013, as compared to 2012, due primarily to the following: 2013 Increase/(Decrease) (Millions of Dollars) Compared to 2012 Transmission Costs $ 37.7 Basic Service Costs 20.2 Purchased Power Contracts 9.5 Deferred Fuel Costs (6.6) $ 60.8 The increase in transmission costs was due primarily to higher RNS costs. The increase in basic service costs was due primarily to higher average energy supply prices. The increase in purchased power contracts was due primarily to higher congestion charges. The decrease in deferred fuel costs was due primarily to higher average energy supply prices, as compared to the prices projected when basic service rates were set. Purchased Power and Transmission costs are included in regulatory-approved tracking mechanisms and do not impact earnings. Operations and Maintenance decreased in 2013, as compared to 2012, due primarily to the absence of several adjustments recorded in the first quarter of 2012, the majority of which were recognized for changes in accounting estimates ($46.7 million), the absence of a bill credit to customers ($15 million) as a result of the Massachusetts merger settlement agreement, and an overall reduction in other operating costs ($2.1 million). These positive factors were partially offset by higher PAM-related amortizations ($4.1 million) as well as timing of maintenance ($4.3 million). Depreciation increased in 2013, as compared to 2012, due primarily to higher utility plant balances resulting from completed construction projects placed into service. 62 Amortization of Regulatory Assets, Net increased in 2013, as compared to 2012, due primarily to an increase in the recovery of previously deferred transition costs. Amortization of Rate Reduction Bonds decreased in 2013, as compared to 2012, due to the maturity of the RRBs in March 2013. Energy Efficiency Programs increased in 2013, as compared to 2012, due primarily to an increase in energy efficiency costs in accordance with the three-year program guidelines established by the DPU. All costs are fully recovered through DPU-approved tracking mechanisms and therefore do not impact earnings. Taxes Other Than Income Taxes increased in 2013, as compared to 2012, due to higher municipal property taxes as a result of an increase in Property, Plant and Equipment. Interest Expense increased $0.3 million in 2013, as compared to 2012, due primarily to lower regulatory interest income primarily from deferred transition costs, partially offset by lower average long-term bond rates. Income Tax Expense For the Years Ended December 31, (Millions of Dollars) 2013 2012 Increase Percent Income Tax Expense $ 172.9 $ 124.0 $ 48.9 39.4 % Income Tax Expense increased in 2013, as compared to 2012, due primarily to higher pre-tax earnings ($44 million) and the absence in 2013 of the impact of costs recognized as a result of the Massachusetts merger settlement agreement ($5.9 million), partially offset by various other impacts ($1 million). EARNINGS SUMMARY For the Years Ended December 31, (Millions of Dollars) 2013 2012 Income Before Merger-Related Costs $ 268.5 $ 201.1 Merger-Related Costs (after-tax) (1) - (10.9) Net Income $ 268.5 $ 190.2 (1) The 2012 after-tax merger-related costs consisted of a $15 million pre-tax charge for customer bill credits related to the Massachusetts merger settlement agreement and a $2.8 million pre-tax charge related to compensation costs. Excluding the impact of merger-related costs, NSTAR Electric earnings increased $67.4 million in 2013, as compared to 2012, due primarily to lower overall operations and maintenance costs and higher retail electric sales due primarily to colder weather in the first and fourth quarters in 2013. Partially offsetting these factors was higher depreciation and property tax expense. CAPITAL EXPENDITURES A summary of capital expenditures, including amounts incurred but not paid, cost of removal, AFUDC, and the capitalized portions of pension expense, is as follows: For the Years Ended December 31, (Millions of Dollars) 2013 2012 2011 Transmission $ 220.8 $ 192.1 $ 162.5 Distribution: Basic Business 98.5 64.2 58.5 Aging Infrastructure 110.6 145.8 132.8 Load Growth 53.6 21.2 19.3 Total Distribution 262.7 231.2 210.6 Total $ 483.5 $ 423.3 $ 373.1 LIQUIDITY NSTAR Electric had cash flows provided by operating activities of $466.9 million in 2013, compared with $506.9 million in 2012 (amounts are net of RRB payments, which are included in financing activities). The decrease in operating cash flows was due primarily to a $57 million increase in Pension Plan contributions in 2013, as compared to 2012, and a $75.3 million increase in net tax payments. Partially offsetting the negative cash flow impacts was the absence in 2013 of $15 million in bill credits provided to customers in the second quarter of 2012 in connection with the Massachusetts merger settlement agreement. In addition, operating cash flows benefitted from an increase in amortization on regulatory deferrals primarily attributable to tracking mechanisms where such revenues exceeded costs resulting in a favorable cash flow impact. 63 RESULTS OF OPERATIONS PUBLIC SERVICE COMPANY OF NEW HAMPSHIRE AND SUBSIDIARY The following table provides the amounts and variances in operating revenues and expense line items for the consolidated statements of income for PSNH included in this Annual Report on Form 10-K for the years ended December 31, 2013 and 2012: Operating Revenues and Expenses For the Years Ended December 31, (Millions of Dollars) 2013 2012 Increase/ Percent (Decrease) Operating Revenues $ 935.4 $ 988.0 $ (52.6) (5.3) % Operating Expenses: Purchased Power, Fuel and Transmission 269.8 319.3 (49.5) (15.5) Operations and Maintenance 267.8 263.2 4.6 1.7 Depreciation 91.6 87.6 4.0 4.6 Amortization of Regulatory Liabilities, Net (20.4) (24.1) 3.7 15.4 Amortization of Rate Reduction Bonds 19.7 56.6 (36.9) (65.2) Energy Efficiency Programs 14.5 14.2 0.3 2.1 Taxes Other Than Income Taxes 67.2 66.1 1.1 1.7 Total Operating Expenses 710.2 782.9 (72.7) (9.3) Operating Income $ 225.2 $ 205.1 $ 20.1 9.8 % Operating Revenues PSNH's retail sales were as follows: For the Years Ended December 31, 2013 2012 Increase Percent Retail Sales in GWh 7,938 7,821 117 1.5 % PSNH's Operating Revenues decreased in 2013, as compared to 2012, due primarily to: A $73.2 million decrease related to PSNH's cost recovery mechanisms. The primary reason for this decrease was the reduction of recoveries related to PSNH RRBs, which were fully collected during the first half of 2013. This reduction had no impact on earnings. Partially offset by: A $17.3 million increase in base distribution revenues reflecting a 1.5 percent increase in retail sales. PSNH experienced strong sales in early and late 2013 due to colder winter weather than what was experienced in 2012. Also reflected in this revenue increase was an increase of $11.9 million related to NHPUC-approved distribution rate increases effective July 1, 2012 and July 1, 2013 as a result of the 2010 distribution rate case settlement. A $3.3 million increase in transmission revenues reflecting recovery of higher transmission expenses and continuing transmission infrastructure investments. The increase was mostly offset by the establishment of a reserve related to the FERC ALJ initial decision in the third quarter of 2013. Purchased Power, Fuel and Transmission decreased in 2013, as compared to 2012, due primarily to a decrease in costs related to renewable energy and a decrease in fuel costs resulting from an increase in customer migration to third party suppliers, which resulted in a decrease in load obligation. These decreases were partially offset by an increase in transmission costs resulting from higher RNS costs. Purchased Power, Fuel and Transmission costs are included in regulatory-approved tracking mechanisms and do not impact earnings. Operations and Maintenance increased in 2013, as compared to 2012, due primarily to an increase in routine maintenance and storm-related distribution overhead line costs ($11.4 million) and an increase in routine generation maintenance costs ($4.4 million). Partially offsetting these increases was the absence in 2013 of PBOP transition obligation amortization ($2.5 million), lower distribution general and administrative costs ($3 million), a decrease in RRB charges that are included in NHPUC-approved tracking mechanisms ($2.9 million), and a decrease in routine transmission maintenance ($1.4 million). Depreciation increased in 2013, as compared to 2012, due primarily to higher utility plant balances resulting from completed construction projects placed into service. Amortization of Regulatory Liabilities, Net increased expenses in 2013, as compared to 2012, due primarily to an increase in the ES and TCAM amortization ($23.3 million and $9.2 million, respectively), partially offset by a decrease in the SCRC amortization ($27.9 million). Amortization of Rate Reduction Bonds decreased in 2013, as compared to 2012, due to the maturity of the RRBs in May 2013. Taxes Other Than Income Taxes increased in 2013, as compared to 2012, due primarily to an increase in property taxes as a result of an increase in Property, Plant and Equipment and an increase in the property tax rates. 64 Interest Expense decreased $4.1 million in 2013, as compared to 2012, due primarily to lower interest on RRBs ($2.8 million) as a result of the maturity of the RRBs in May 2013, and a decrease in interest on long-term debt ($1.9 million) due primarily to the redemption of the 2001 Series C PCRBs in May 2013. Income Tax Expense For the Years Ended December 31, (Millions of Dollars) 2013 2012 Increase Percent Income Tax Expense $ 71.1 $ 61.0 $ 10.1 16.6 % Income Tax Expense increased in 2013, as compared to 2012, due primarily to higher pre-tax earnings ($8.6 million) and various other impacts ($1.5 million). EARNINGS SUMMARY For the Years Ended December 31, (Millions of Dollars) 2013 2012 Increase Net Income $ 111.4 $ 96.9 $ 14.5 PSNH earnings increased due primarily to higher generation earnings and distribution retail revenues. The 2013 distribution retail revenues were favorably impacted by the PSNH rate increases effective July 1, 2012 and July 1, 2013 as a result of the 2010 distribution rate case settlement and a 1.5 percent increase in retail sales. PSNH experienced strong sales in early and late 2013 due to colder winter weather than what was experienced in 2012. Partially offsetting these favorable earnings impacts were higher depreciation and property tax expense. LIQUIDITY PSNH had cash flows provided by operating activities of $158.8 million in 2013, compared with $174.2 million in 2012 (amounts are net of RRB payments, which are included in financing activities). The decrease in cash flows was due primarily to an increase in NUSCO Pension Plan contributions of $20.6 million in 2013, as compared to 2012, and an increase in coal and fuel inventories in 2013 creating a negative cash flow impact of $34.6 million, as compared to a reduction in coal and fuel inventories in 2012 creating a positive cash flow impact of $28.1 million. Partially offsetting these decreases were income tax refunds of $30.1 million in 2013, compared to income tax payments of $14.7 million in 2012, the absence of $13.7 million of 2012 cash disbursements for storm costs associated with Tropical Storm Irene and the October 2011 snowstorm and the favorable impacts related to the distribution rate increases effective July 1, 2012 and July 1, 2013 as a result of the 2010 distribution rate case settlement. 65 RESULTS OF OPERATIONS WESTERN MASSACHUSETTS ELECTRIC COMPANY The following table provides the amounts and variances in operating revenues and expense line items for the statements of income for WMECO included in this Annual Report on Form 10-K for the years ended December 31, 2013 and 2012: Operating Revenues and Expenses For the Years Ended December 31, (Millions of Dollars) 2013 2012 Increase/ Percent (Decrease) Operating Revenues $ 472.7 $ 441.2 $ 31.5 7.1 % Operating Expenses: Purchased Power and Transmission 147.1 136.1 11.0 8.1 Operations and Maintenance 96.2 97.0 (0.8) (0.8) Depreciation 37.6 30.0 7.6 25.3 Amortization of Regulatory (Liabilities)/Assets, Net (3.2) 0.4 (3.6) (a) Amortization of Rate Reduction Bonds 7.8 17.6 (9.8) (55.7) Energy Efficiency Programs 39.5 27.8 11.7 42.1 Taxes Other Than Income Taxes 28.4 21.5 6.9 32.1 Total Operating Expenses 353.4 330.4 23.0 7.0 Operating Income $ 119.3 $ 110.8 $ 8.5 7.7 % (a) Percent greater than 100 percent not shown as it is not meaningful. Operating Revenues WMECO's retail sales were as follows: For the Years Ended December 31, 2013 2012 Change Percent Retail Sales in GWh 3,683 3,683 - - % WMECO's Operating Revenues increased in 2013, as compared to 2012, due primarily to: A $21.3 million increase in transmission revenues reflecting recovery of higher transmission expenses and continuing transmission infrastructure investments, primarily related to the NEEWS project. The increase was partially offset by the establishment of a reserve related to the FERC ALJ initial decision in the third quarter of 2013. Base distribution revenues are consistent with 2012, as they are decoupled from sales volumes. The remaining increase primarily reflects a higher level of collections related to WMECO energy supply and company-sponsored energy efficiency programs. These revenues are fully reconciled to the related costs. Therefore this increase in revenues had no material impact on earnings. Purchased Power and Transmission increased in 2013, as compared to 2012, due primarily to an increase in supplier contract prices. Purchased Power and Transmission costs are included in regulatory-approved tracking mechanisms and do not impact earnings. Operations and Maintenance decreased in 2013, as compared to 2012, due primarily to the absence in 2013 of bill credits to customers ($3 million) made in the second quarter of 2012 as a result of the Massachusetts merger settlement agreement and the absence in 2013 of the DPU storm penalty ($2 million). In addition, there were lower general and administrative expenses ($2.5 million). Partially offsetting these decreases was an increase in Pension and PBOP Plan costs ($6.6 million), which is recovered through DPU-approved tracking mechanisms and has no earnings impact. Depreciation increased in 2013, as compared to 2012, due primarily to higher utility plant balances resulting from completed construction projects placed into service. Amortization of Regulatory (Liabilities)/Assets, Net decreased in 2013, as compared to 2012, due primarily to a decrease in amortization of the transition charge deferral. Amortization of Rate Reduction Bonds decreased in 2013, as compared to 2012, due to the maturity of the RRBs in June 2013. Energy Efficiency Programs increased in 2013, as compared to 2012, due primarily to an increase in expenses attributable to an increase in spending in accordance with the three-year program guidelines established by the DPU. All costs are fully recovered through DPU-approved tracking mechanisms and therefore do not impact earnings. Taxes Other Than Income Taxes increased in 2013, as compared to 2012, due primarily to an increase in property taxes as a result of an increase in Property, Plant and Equipment and an increase in the property tax rates. 66 Interest Expense decreased $1.8 million in 2013, as compared to 2012, due primarily to lower interest on RRBs ($1.1 million) as a result of the maturity of the RRBs in June 2013, and lower interest on short-term debt ($0.9 million). Income Tax Expense For the Years Ended December 31, (Millions of Dollars) 2013 2012 Increase Percent Income Tax Expense $ 37.4 $ 32.1 $ 5.3 16.5 % Income Tax Expense increased in 2013, as compared to 2012, due primarily to higher pre-tax earnings ($2.9 million), the absence in 2013 of the impact of costs recognized as a result of the Massachusetts merger settlement agreement ($1.2 million) and various other impacts ($1.2 million). EARNINGS SUMMARY For the Years Ended December 31, (Millions of Dollars) 2013 2012 Income Before Merger-Related Costs $ 60.4 $ 56.3 Merger-Related Costs (after-tax) - (1.8) Net Income $ 60.4 $ 54.5 Excluding the impact of merger-related costs, WMECO earnings increased $4.1 million, as compared to 2012, due primarily to higher transmission earnings as a result of an increased level of investment in transmission infrastructure, primarily related to the NEEWS project. Partially offsetting this favorable earnings impact was higher depreciation and property tax expense. LIQUIDITY WMECO had cash flows provided by operating activities of $169.5 million in 2013, compared with $77 million in 2012 (amounts are net of RRB payments, which are included in financing activities). The improved cash flows were due primarily to income tax refunds of $69 million in 2013, compared with income tax refunds of $8.4 million in 2012, the absence of $16.7 million in 2012 cash disbursements for storm costs in 2012 and the absence of $3 million in bill credits provided to customers in the second quarter of 2012 associated with the Massachusetts merger settlement agreement. 67
