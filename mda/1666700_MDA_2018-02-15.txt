ITEM 7. MANAGEMENT'S DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS OF FINANCIAL CONDITION AND RESULTS OF OPERATIONS On December 11, 2015, The Dow Chemical Company ("Dow") and E. I. du Pont de Nemours and Company ("DuPont") entered into an Agreement and Plan of Merger ("Merger Agreement"), as amended on March 31, 2017, to effect an all-stock merger of equals strategic combination resulting in a newly formed corporation named DowDuPont Inc. ("DowDuPont" or the "Company"). On August 31, 2017, pursuant to the Merger Agreement, Dow and DuPont each merged with wholly owned subsidiaries of DowDuPont ("Mergers") and, as a result of the Mergers, Dow and DuPont became subsidiaries of DowDuPont (collectively, the "Merger"). Prior to the Merger, DowDuPont did not conduct any business activities other than those required for its formation and matters contemplated by the Merger Agreement. Dow was determined to be the accounting acquirer in the Merger. As a result, the historical financial statements of Dow for the periods prior to the Merger are considered to be the historical financial statements of DowDuPont. The results of DuPont are included in DowDuPont's consolidated results from the Merger date forward. See Note 3 to the Consolidated Financial Statements for additional information. Except as otherwise indicated by the context, the term "Union Carbide" means Union Carbide Corporation, a wholly owned subsidiary of Dow; and, "Dow Corning" means Dow Corning Corporation, a wholly owned subsidiary of Dow. Items Affecting Comparability of Financial Results Due to the size of Dow and DuPont's businesses prior to the Merger, in this section certain supplemental unaudited pro forma financial information is provided that assumes the Merger had been consummated on January 1, 2016. For all periods presented in the unaudited pro forma financial information, adjustments have been made for (1) the preliminary purchase accounting impact, (2) accounting policy alignment, (3) the elimination of the effects of events that are directly attributable to the Merger Agreement (e.g., one-time transaction costs), (4) the elimination of the impact of transactions between Dow and DuPont, and (5) the elimination of the effect of consummated divestitures required as a condition of regulatory approval for the Merger. Events that are not expected to have a continuing impact on the combined results (e.g., inventory step-up costs) are excluded. These adjustments impacted the consolidated results as well as the reportable segments. For additional information, see the Supplemental Unaudited Pro Forma Combined Financial Information in this section.

Cost of Sales Cost of sales was $50.4 billion in 2017, up from $37.6 billion in 2016. Cost of sales in 2017 was negatively impacted by a $1,469 million charge for the fair value step-up of inventories assumed in the Merger and the acquisition of the H&N Business, related to Agriculture ($424 million), Packaging & Specialty Plastics ($120 million), Electronics & Imaging ($138 million), Nutrition & Biosciences ($403 million), Transportation & Advanced Polymers ($211 million) and Safety & Construction ($173 million); a charge of $888 million related to the payment of plan obligations to certain participants of a Dow U.S. non-qualified pension plan as a result of the Merger (related to Corporate); and $49 million of transaction costs and productivity actions (related to Corporate). Excluding these significant items, cost of sales increased primarily due to the Merger, increased sales volume, higher feedstock, energy and other raw material costs, higher commissioning expenses related to Dow's U.S. Gulf Coast growth projects and the addition of Dow Corning's silicones business. Cost of sales as a percentage of sales was 80.7 percent compared with 78.2 percent in 2016. See Notes 3 and 19 to the Consolidated Financial Statements for additional information. 37 Table of Contents Cost of sales was $37.6 billion in 2016, down slightly from $37.7 billion in 2015. Cost of sales was negatively impacted by a $317 million charge associated with the fair value step-up of inventories assumed in the ownership restructure of Dow Corning's silicones business, related to Performance Materials & Coatings ($213 million), Electronics & Imaging ($69 million) and Transportation & Advanced Polymers ($35 million); a $295 million charge for environmental matters, related to Agriculture ($2 million), Industrial Intermediates & Infrastructure ($1 million), Packaging & Specialty Plastics ($2 million) and Corporate ($290 million); $123 million of transaction costs and productivity actions (related to Corporate); and a $117 million charge for the termination of a terminal use agreement (related to Packaging & Specialty Plastics). Excluding these significant items, cost of sales decreased compared with 2015 as lower feedstock, energy and other raw material costs and cost cutting and productivity initiatives more than offset increased sales volume and the addition of Dow Corning's silicones business. Cost of sales in 2015 was impacted by $12 million loss for the fair value step-up of inventories assumed in the step acquisition of UnivationTechnologies, LLC ("Univation") (related to Packaging & Specialty Plastics). Cost of sales as a percentage of sales was 78.2 percent in 2016 compared with 77.4 percent in 2015. See Notes 3 and 16 to the Consolidated Financial Statements for additional information. Research and Development Expenses Research and development expenses were $2,110 million in 2017 , compared with $1,584 million in 2016 and $1,598 million in 2015 . In 2017, R&D expenses increased compared with 2016, primarily due to the Merger. In 2016, R&D expenses decreased slightly compared with 2015, as increased costs from the addition of Dow Corning's silicones business were more than offset by decreased spending due to divestitures and cost reduction initiatives as well as lower performance-based compensation costs. R&D expenses as a percentage of net sales were 3.4 percent, 3.3 percent and 3.3 percent for 2017, 2016 and 2015, respectively. Selling, General and Administrative Expenses Selling, general and administrative expenses were $4,021 million in 2017 , compared with $2,956 million in 2016 and $2,948 million in 2015 . SG&A expenses in 2017 increased compared with 2016, primarily due to the Merger. SG&A expenses were essentially flat in 2016 compared with 2015, as increased costs from the addition of Dow Corning's silicones business were nearly offset by decreased spending due to divestitures and cost reduction initiatives as well as lower performance-based compensation costs. SG&A expenses as a percentage of net sales were 6.4 percent, 6.1 percent and 6.0 percent for 2017, 2016 and 2015, respectively. Amortization of Intangibles Amortization of intangibles was $1,013 million in 2017 , $544 million in 2016 and $419 million in 2015 . The increase in amortization in 2017 was primarily due to an increase in intangible assets as a result of the Merger and the addition of Dow Corning's silicones business. The increase in amortization in 2016 was primarily due to an increase in intangible assets as a result of the addition of Dow Corning's silicones business. See Notes 3 and 13 to the Consolidated Financial Statements for additional information on intangible assets. Restructuring, Goodwill Impairment and Asset Related Charges - net DowDuPont Cost Synergy Program In September and November 2017, DowDuPont approved post-merger restructuring actions under the DowDuPont Cost Synergy Program (the Synergy Program ), adopted by the DowDuPont Board of Directors. The plan is designed to integrate and optimize the organization following the Merger and in preparation for the Intended Business Separations. Based on all actions approved to date under the Synergy Program, the Company expects to record total pretax restructuring charges of approximately $2 billion , comprised of approximately $845 million to $935 million of severance and related benefit costs; $400 million to $540 million of asset write-downs and write-offs, and $400 million to $450 million of costs associated with exit and disposal activities. The Synergy Program includes certain asset actions, including strategic decisions regarding the cellulosic biofuel unit reflected in the preliminary fair value measurement of DuPont assets as of the merger date. Current estimated total pretax restructuring charges could be impacted by future adjustments to the preliminary fair value of DuPont assets. As a result of these actions, the Company recorded pretax restructuring charges of $874 million in 2017, consisting of severance and related benefit costs of $510 million , asset write-downs and write-offs of $290 million and costs associated with exit and disposal activities of $74 million . The restructuring charges by segment are as follows: $134 million in Agriculture, $11 million in Performance Materials & Coatings, $12 million in Industrial Intermediates & Infrastructure, $36 million in Packaging & Specialty Plastics, $86 million in Electronics & Imaging, $1 million in Nutrition & Biosciences, $2 million in Transportation & Advanced Polymers, $21 million in Safety & Construction and $571 million in Corporate. The Company expects to record the remaining restructuring charges over the next two years and expects the Synergy Program to be substantially completed by the end of 2019. Dow 2016 Restructuring Plan On June 27, 2016, Dow's Board of Directors ("Board") approved a restructuring plan that incorporated actions related to the ownership restructure of Dow Corning. These actions, aligned with Dow's value growth and synergy targets, will result in a global workforce reduction of approximately 2,500 positions, with most of these positions resulting from synergies related to the 38 Table of Contents ownership restructure of Dow Corning. These actions are expected to be substantially completed by June 30, 2018. As a result of these actions, Dow recorded pretax restructuring charges of $449 million in the second quarter of 2016, consisting of severance and related benefit costs of $268 million , asset write-downs and write-offs of $153 million and costs associated with exit and disposal activities of $28 million and related to the Company's segment results as follows: $42 million in Performance Materials & Coatings, $83 million in Industrial Intermediates & Infrastructure, $10 million in Packaging & Specialty Plastics and $314 million in Corporate. In 2017, Dow recorded a favorable adjustment to the 2016 restructuring charge related to costs associated with exit and disposal activities of $7 million, related to Performance Materials & Coatings. Dow 2015 Restructuring Plan On April 29, 2015, Dow's Board approved actions to further streamline the organization and optimize Dow footprint as a result of the separation of a significant portion of Dow chlorine value chain. These actions, which further accelerated Dow value growth and productivity targets, resulted in a reduction of approximately 1,750 positions across a number of businesses and functions and adjustments to Dow's asset footprint to enhance competitiveness. As a result of these actions, Dow recorded pretax restructuring charges of $375 million in the second quarter of 2015 consisting of severance and related benefit costs of $196 million , asset write-downs and write-offs of $169 million and costs associated with exit and disposal activities of $10 million . In the fourth quarter of 2015, Dow recorded restructuring charge adjustments of $40 million , including severance and related benefit costs of $39 million for the separation of approximately 500 additional positions as part of Dow's efforts to further streamline the organization, and $1 million of costs associated with exit and disposal activities. The impact of these charges were related to the Company's segment results as follows: $15 million in Agriculture, $10 million in Performance Materials & Coatings, $12 million in Packaging & Specialty Plastics, $51 million in Electronics & Imaging, $16 million in Nutrition & Biosciences, $17 million in Safety & Construction and $294 million in Corporate. These actions were substantially completed at June 30, 2017. In 2016, Dow recorded an unfavorable adjustment to the 2015 restructuring charge for additional accruals for costs associated with exit and disposal activities of $6 million and a favorable adjustment of $3 million for asset write-downs and write-offs. The net charge was included in in the Company's segment results as follows: Agriculture ($5 million charge), Nutrition & Biosciences ($1 million charge) and Safety & Construction ($3 million gain). In 2017, the Company recorded favorable adjustments to the 2015 restructuring charge of $9 million for severance and related benefit costs, impacting Corporate, and $1 million for costs associated with exit and disposal activities related to Agriculture. See Note 5 to the Consolidated Financial Statements for details on the Company's restructuring activities. Goodwill Impairment Upon completion of the goodwill impairment testing in the fourth quarter of 2017, the Company determined the fair value of the Coatings & Performance Monomers reporting unit was lower than its carrying amount. As a result, the Company recorded an impairment charge of $1,491 million in the fourth quarter of 2017, related to Performance Materials & Coatings. See Note 13 to the Consolidated Financial Statements for additional information on the impairment charge. Asset Related Charges 2017 Charges In 2017, the Company recognized a $622 million pretax impairment charge related to a biopolymers manufacturing facility in Santa Vitoria, Minas Gerais, Brazil. Dow determined it will not pursue an expansion of the facility ethanol mill into downstream derivative products, primarily as a result of cheaper ethane-based production as well as Dow new assets coming online in the U.S. Gulf Coast which can be used to meet growing market demands in Brazil. As a result of this decision, cash flow analysis indicated the carrying amount of the impacted assets was not recoverable. The impairment charge was related to Packaging & Specialty Plastics. The Company also recognized other pretax impairment charges of $317 million in the fourth quarter of 2017, including charges related to manufacturing assets of $230 million , an equity method investment of $81 million and other assets of $6 million . The impairment charges were related to Performance Materials & Coatings ( $82 million ), Industrial Intermediates & Infrastructure ( $6 million ), Packaging & Specialty Plastics ( $57 million ), Electronics & Imaging ( $39 million ), Safety & Construction ( $32 million ) and Corporate ( $101 million ). See Notes 5 , 22 and 23 to the Consolidated Financial Statements for additional information. 2016 Charges In 2016, Dow recognized a $143 million pretax impairment charge related to its equity interest in AgroFresh Solutions, Inc. ("AFSI") due to a decline in the market value of AFSI. The impairment charge impacted Corporate. See Notes 4 , 5 , 12 , 22 and 23 to the Consolidated Financial Statements for additional information. 39 Table of Contents 2015 Charges As a result of Dow continued actions to optimize its footprint, Dow recognized an impairment charge of $144 million in 2015, related to manufacturing assets and facilities and an equity method investment. The impairment charge related to Performance Materials & Coatings ( $71 million ), Packaging & Specialty Plastics ( $57 million ) and Safety & Construction ( $16 million ). See Notes 5 and 22 to the Consolidated Financial Statements for additional information. Integration and Separation Costs Integration and separation costs, which reflect costs related to the Merger, post-Merger integration and Intended Business Separation activities and costs related to the ownership restructure of Dow Corning, were $1,101 million in 2017 , $349 million in 2016 and $23 million in 2015 , and were related to Corporate. Asbestos-Related Charge In 2016, Dow and Union Carbide Corporation elected to change the method of accounting for asbestos-related defense and processing costs from expensing as incurred to estimating and accruing a liability. As a result of this accounting policy change, Union Carbide recorded a pretax charge of $1,009 million for asbestos-related defense costs through the terminal year of 2049. Union Carbide also recorded a pretax charge of $104 million to increase the asbestos-related liability for pending and future claims through the terminal year of 2049. These charges were related to Corporate. See Notes 1 and 16 to the Consolidated Financial Statements for additional information on asbestos-related matters. Equity in Earnings of Nonconsolidated Affiliates DowDuPont share of the earnings of nonconsolidated affiliates in 2017 was $764 million , compared with $442 million in 2016 and $674 million in 2015. In 2017, equity earnings increased as lower equity losses from Sadara Chemical Company ("Sadara") and higher equity earnings from The Kuwait Olefins Company K.S.C. ("TKOC"), EQUATE Petrochemical Company K.S.C. ("EQUATE") and the HSC Group, which included settlements with a customer related to long-term polysilicon sales agreements, were partially offset by the impact of the Dow Corning ownership restructure and lower equity earnings from The SCG-Dow Group and Map Ta Phut Olefins Company Limited. In 2016, equity earnings declined due to higher equity losses from Sadara related to start-up expenses, lower equity earnings from the Kuwait joint ventures due to lower monoethylene glycol prices and a reduction in the ownership of MEGlobal (now part of EQUATE), and the impact of the Dow Corning ownership restructure. Equity earnings also declined due to a charge of $22 million for a loss on early redemption of debt incurred by Dow Corning and related to Performance Materials & Coatings ($15 million), Electronics & Imaging ($5 million) and Transportation & Advanced Polymers ($2 million). These declines were partia lly offset by higher earnings from the HSC Group, The SCG-Dow Group a nd Map Ta Phut Olefins Company Limited. Equity earnings in 2015 were impacted by a $29 million charge related to AFSI's fair value step-up of its inventories and start-up costs (related to Corporate); a loss recognized by Sadara related to the write-off of design engineering work for an epoxy plant, of which the Company's share was $27 million (related to Corporate); and a pretax gain of $20 million related to a reduction in Dow Corning's implant liability (related to Performance Materials & Coatings). See Note 12 to the Consolidated Financial Statements for additional information on nonconsolidated affiliates. Sundry Income (Expense) - Net Sundry income (expense) net includes a variety of income and expense items such as the gain or loss on foreign currency exchange, interest income, dividends from investments, gains and losses on sales of investments and assets and litigation. Sundry income (expense) - net for 2017 was income of $966 million , compared with income of $1,452 million in 2016 and income of $4,716 million in 2015. In 2017, sundry income (expense) - net included a $635 million gain on the divestiture of the DAS Divested Ag Business (related to Agriculture), a $227 million gain on the divestiture of Dow's EAA Business (related to Packaging & Specialty Plastics), a $137 million gain related to Dow's patent infringement matter with Nova Chemical Corporation (related to Packaging & Specialty Plastics), a $7 million gain for post-closing adjustments on the split-off of Dow's chlorine value chain (related to Corporate), gains on sales of other assets and investments and interest income. These gains more than offset a loss of $469 million related to Dow AgroSciences' arbitration matter with Bayer CropScience (related to Agriculture) and foreign currency exchange losses. See Notes 4 , 6 , 7 and 16 to the Consolidated Financial Statements for additional information. In 2016, sundry income (expense) - net included a $2,445 million gain on the Dow Corning ownership restructure (related to Performance Materials & Coatings ($1,617 million), Electronics & Imaging ($512 million) and Transportation & Advanced Polymers ($316 million)), a $6 million gain for post-closing adjustments on the split-off of Dow's chlorine value chain (related to Industrial Intermediates &Infrastructure), gains on sales of assets and investments, and interest income. These gains more than offset a $1,235 million loss related to Dow's settlement of the urethane matters class action lawsuit and the opt-out cases litigation (related to Industrial Intermediates & Infrastructure), $41 million of transaction costs and productivity actions (related to Corporate), 40 Table of Contents losses on divestitures and foreign currency exchange losses. See Notes 3 , 4 , 6 , 7 , 12 and 16 to the Consolidated Financial Statements for additional information. In 2015, sundry income (expense) - net included a $2,233 million gain on the split-off of Dow's chlorine value chain (related to Industrial Intermediates & Infrastructure (gain of $1,984 million), Packaging & Specialty Plastics (gain of $317 million) and Corporate (loss of $68 million)), a $723 million gain on the sale of Dow's ownership interest in MEGlobal (related to Industrial Intermediates & Infrastructure), a $682 million gain on the divestiture of ANGUS Chemical Company (related to Industrial Intermediates & Infrastructure), a $20 million gain on the divestiture of Dow's global Sodium Borohydride business (related to Industrial Intermediates & Infrastructure), a $618 million gain on the divestiture of Dow's AgroFresh business (net of an $8 million loss for mark-to-market adjustments on the fair value of warrants receivable and related to Corporate), a $361 million gain on the Univation step acquisition (related to Packaging & Specialty Plastics), gains on sales of assets and investments and interest income. These gains more than offset foreign currency exchange losses, including a $98 million loss related to the impact of the Argentine peso devaluation (related to Corporate), and $119 million of transaction costs and productivity actions (related to Corporate). See Notes 3 , 4 , 6 , 7 , 12 , 15 and 22 to the Consolidated Financial Statements for additional information. Interest Expense and Amortization of Debt Discount Interest expense and amortization of debt discount was $1,082 million in 2017, $858 million in 2016 and $946 million in 2015. The increase in 2017 was primarily related to the Merger and the effect of the long-term debt assumed in the Dow Corning ownership restructure. The decrease in 2016 was primarily due to the impact of approximately $2.5 billion of debt retired in 2015. See Liquidity and Capital Resources in Management's Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations and Note 15 to the Consolidated Financial Statements for additional information related to debt financing activity. Provision (Credit) for Income Taxes on Continuing Operations The Company's effective tax rate fluctuates based on, among other factors, where income is earned, reinvestment assertions regarding foreign income and the level of income relative to tax credits available. The Company's tax rate is also influenced by the level of equity earnings, since most of the earnings from the Company's equity method investments are taxed at the joint venture level. The underlying factors affecting the Company's overall tax rate are summarized in Note 8 to the Consolidated Financial Statements. On December 22, 2017, the Tax Cuts and Jobs Act ( The Act ) was enacted. The Act reduces the U.S. federal corporate income tax rate from 35 percent to 21 percent, requires companies to pay a one-time transition tax on earnings of foreign subsidiaries that were previously deferred, creates new provisions related to foreign sourced earnings, eliminates the domestic manufacturing deduction and moves to a territorial system. At December 31, 2017, the Company had not completed its accounting for the tax effects of The Act; however, the Company made a reasonable estimate of the effects on its existing deferred tax balances, which resulted in a provisional benefit of $2,666 million to "Provision (Credit) for income taxes on continuing operations," and the one-time transition tax, which resulted in a provisional charge of $1,580 million to "Provision (Credit) for income taxes on continuing operations." The Company expects that it will have sufficient foreign tax credits available to offset the tax liability associated with the one-time transition tax. See Note 8 to the Consolidated Financial Statements for additional information. The "Provision (Credit) for income taxes on continuing operations" was a benefit of $476 million in 2017, and a charge of $9 million in 2016 and $2,147 million in 2015. The tax rate for 2017 was favorably impacted by a provisional net benefit of $1,086 million that the Company recognized due to the enactment of The Act, as well as the geographic mix of earnings. In addition, the tax rate was favorably impacted by the adoption of Accounting Standards Update ("ASU") 2016-09, "Compensation - Stock Compensation (Topic 718): Improvements to Employee Share-Based Payment Accounting," which resulted in the recognition of excess tax benefits related to equity compensation in the provision for income taxes. These impacts were partially offset by a goodwill impairment recognized in the fourth quarter for which there was no corresponding tax deduction, amortization of the fair value step-up of DuPont inventories as a result of the Merger and certain net foreign currency exchange losses recognized on the remeasurement of the net monetary asset positions which were not tax deductible in their local jurisdictions. These factors resulted in a negative tax rate of 39.9 percent for 2017. The tax rate for Dow in 2016 was favorably impacted by the non-taxable gain on the ownership restructure of Dow Corning's silicones business and a tax benefit on the reassessment of a deferred tax liability related to the basis difference in Dow investment in Dow Corning. The tax rate was also favorably impacted by the geographic mix of earnings, the availability of foreign tax credits and the deductibility of the urethane matters class action lawsuit and opt-out cases settlements and the asbestos-related charge. A reduction in equity earnings and non-deductible transaction costs and productivity actions unfavorably impacted the tax rate. These factors resulted in an effective tax rate of 0.2 percent for 2016 . The tax rate for Dow in 2015 was favorably impacted by portfolio actions, specifically the tax-efficient split-off of Dow's chlorine value chain, the non-taxable gain from the Univation step acquisition, and the sale of Dow's ownership interest in MEGlobal. The 41 Table of Contents geographic mix of earnings favorably impacted the tax rate with the gain from the ANGUS Chemical Company divestiture and continued profitability improvement in Europe and Asia Pacific providing most of the benefit. The tax rate was unfavorably impacted by foreign subsidiaries repatriating cash to the United States which was primarily derived from divestiture proceeds. Reduced equity earnings and continued increases in statutory income in Latin America and Canada due to local currency devaluations also unfavorably impacted the tax rate. These factors resulted in an effective tax rate of 21.6 percent for 2015 . Loss from Discontinued Operations, Net of Tax Loss from discontinued operations, net of tax was $77 million in 2017 and is related to certain DuPont assets divested as a condition of the regulatory approval of the Merger. See Note 4 to the Consolidated Financial Statements for additional information. Net Income Attributable to Noncontrolling Interests Net income attributable to noncontrolling interests was $132 million in 2017, $86 million in 2016 and $98 million in 2015. Net income attributable to noncontrolling interests increased in 2017 compared with 2016, primarily due to higher earnings from Dow Corning's consolidated joint ventures and improved results from a cogeneration facility in Brazil. Net income attributable to noncontrolling interests decreased in 2016 compared with 2015, primarily due to losses incurred by a cogeneration facility in Brazil, which more than offset the addition of earnings from Dow Corning's consolidated joint ventures. In addition, 2015 was also impacted by noncontrolling interests' portion of the 2015 restructuring charge. See Notes 5 , 18 and 23 to the Consolidated Financial Statements for additional information. Dow Cumulative Convertible Preferred Stock Dividends On December 30, 2016, Dow converted all outstanding shares of its Cumulative Convertible Perpetual Preferred Stock, Series A ("Dow Preferred Stock") into shares of Dow's common stock. As a result of this conversion, no shares of Dow Preferred Stock are issued or outstanding. On January 6, 2017, Dow filed an amendment to its Restated Certificate of Incorporation by way of a certificate of elimination with the Secretary of State of Delaware eliminating this series of preferred stock. Dow Preferred Stock dividends of $340 million were recognized in 2016 and 2015. See Note 17 to the Consolidated Financial Statements for additional information. Net Income Available for DowDuPont Inc. Common Stockholders Net income available for common stockholders was $1,460 million ( $0.91 per share) in 2017, compared with $3,978 million ( $3.52 per share) in 2016 and $7,345 million ( $6.15 per share) in 2015. See Note 9 to the Consolidated Financial Statements for details on the Company's earnings per share calculations. SUPPLEMENTAL UNAUDITED PRO FORMA COMBINED FINANCIAL INFORMATION The following supplemental unaudited pro forma combined statements of income (the "unaudited pro forma income statements") for DowDuPont are presented to illustrate the estimated effects of the Merger, assuming that the Merger had been consummated on January 1, 2016. For the periods presented below, activity prior to August 31, 2017 (the Merger Date ) was prepared on a pro forma basis (the unaudited pro forma information ) and activity after the Merger Date was prepared on a combined basis under accounting principles generally accepted in the United States of America ( U.S. GAAP ). The unaudited pro forma information was prepared in accordance with Article 11 of Regulation S-X. Pro forma adjustments have been made for (1) the preliminary purchase accounting impact, (2) accounting policy alignment, (3) the elimination of the effect of events that are directly attributable to the Merger Agreement (e.g., one-time transaction costs), (4) the elimination of the impact of transactions between Dow and DuPont, and (5) the elimination of the effect of consummated divestitures agreed to with certain regulatory agencies as a condition of approval for the Merger. Events that are not expected to have a continuing impact on the combined results (e.g., inventory step up costs) are excluded from the unaudited pro forma information. The unaudited pro forma information for activity prior to the Merger date does not reflect restructuring or integration activities or other costs following the Merger that may be incurred to achieve cost or growth synergies of DowDuPont. The unaudited pro forma income statements provide shareholders with summary financial information and historical data that is on a basis consistent with how DowDuPont reports current financial information. The Merger was accounted for under Accounting Standards Codification ("ASC") Topic 805, "Business Combinations" ("ASC 805"), under which Dow was designated as the accounting acquirer in the Merger for accounting purposes. Under ASC 805, Dow accounted for the transaction by using Dow historical financial information and accounting policies and adding the assets and liabilities of DuPont as of the Merger Date at their respective fair values. The assets and liabilities of DuPont were measured based on various preliminary estimates at the Merger Date using assumptions that DowDuPont believes are reasonable based on information that was currently available. The fair value estimates reflected in the unaudited pro forma information are based on those used in the Current Report on Form 8-K/A filed with the SEC on October 26, 2017, and subsequent measurement period adjustments are not reflected. DowDuPont intends to complete and finalize the allocation of consideration as soon as practicable within the measurement period in accordance with ASC 805, but no later than one year following the closing date of the Merger. 42 Table of Contents Differences between these preliminary estimates and the final acquisition accounting may occur and these differences could have a material impact on the accompanying unaudited pro forma income statements and DowDuPont future results of operations. The unaudited pro forma information was prepared in accordance with Article 11 of Regulation S-X which is a different basis than the unaudited pro forma information presented in Note 3 to the Consolidated Financial Statements, which was prepared in accordance with the requirements of ASC 805. The unaudited pro forma income statements have been presented for informational purposes only and are not necessarily indicative of what DowDuPont results of operations actually would have been had the Merger been completed on January 1, 2016. In addition, the unaudited pro forma income statements do not purport to project the future operating results of the Company. The unaudited pro forma income statements were based on and should be read in conjunction with the separate historical financial statements and accompanying notes contained in each of the Dow and DuPont Annual Reports on Form 10-K for the applicable periods. See Notes 1 and 3 to the Consolidated Financial Statements for additional information.

Reclassify historical dividends for DuPont preferred stock from "Preferred stock dividends" to "Net income attributable to noncontrolling interests." 46 Table of Contents SEGMENT RESULTS Effective August 31, 2017, Dow and DuPont completed the previously announced merger of equals transaction pursuant to the Merger Agreement resulting in a newly formed corporation named DowDuPont. See Note 3 to the Consolidated Financial Statements for additional information on the Merger. As a result of the Merger, new operating segments were created which are used by management to allocate Company resources and assess performance. The new segments are aligned with the market verticals they serve, while maintaining integration and innovation strengths within strategic value chains. DowDuPont is comprised of nine operating segments, which are aggregated into eight reportable segments: Agriculture; Performance Materials & Coatings; Industrial Intermediates & Infrastructure; Packaging & Specialty Plastics; Electronics & Imaging; Nutrition & Biosciences; Transportation & Advanced Polymers; and Safety & Construction. Corporate contains the reconciliation between the totals for the reportable segments and the Company totals. The Company Nutrition & Biosciences reportable segment consists of two operating segments, Nutrition & Health and Industrial Biosciences, which individually did not meet the quantitative thresholds. DowDuPont reported geographic information for the following regions: U.S. & Canada, Asia Pacific, Latin America, and EMEA. As a result of the Merger, Dow changed the geographic alignment for the country of India to be reflected in Asia Pacific (previously reported in EMEA) and aligned Puerto Rico to U.S. & Canada (previously reported in Latin America). The Company measure of profit/loss for segment reporting purposes is Operating EBITDA (for the period of September 1, 2017 through December 31, 2017 and the twelve months ended December 31, 2015) and pro forma Operating EBITDA (for the period of January 1, 2017 through August 31, 2017 and the twelve months ended December 31, 2016) as this is the manner in which the Company chief operating decision maker ( CODM ) assesses performance and allocates resources. The Company defines Operating EBITDA as earnings (i.e., "Income from continuing operations before income taxes ) before interest, depreciation, amortization and foreign exchange gains (losses), excluding the impact of significant items. Pro forma Operating EBITDA is defined as pro forma earnings (i.e. Pro forma Income from continuing operations before income taxes) before interest, depreciation, amortization and foreign exchange gains (losses), excluding the impact of adjusted significant items. Reconciliations of these measures can be found in Note 24 to the Consolidated Financial Statements. The Company also presents pro forma net sales for 2017 and 2016 as it is included in management measure of segment performance and is regularly reviewed by the CODM. Pro forma adjustments used in the calculation of pro forma net sales and pro forma Operating EBITDA were determined in accordance with Article 11 of Regulation S-X and were based on the historical consolidated financial statements of Dow and DuPont, adjusted to give effect to the Merger as if it had been consummated on January 1, 2016. For additional information on the pro forma adjustments made, see Supplemental Unaudited Pro Forma Combined Financial Information in the preceding section. AGRICULTURE The Agriculture segment leverages the Company technology, customer relationships and industry knowledge to improve the quantity, quality and safety of the global food supply and the global production agriculture industry. Land available for worldwide agricultural production is increasingly limited so production growth will need to be achieved principally through improving crop yields and productivity. The segment two global businesses, Seed and Crop Protection, deliver a broad portfolio of products and services that are specifically targeted to achieve gains in crop yields and productivity, including well-established brands of seed products, crop chemicals, seed treatment, agronomy and digital services. R&D focuses on leveraging germplasm and plant science technology to increase farmer productivity and to enhance the value of grains and oilseeds through improved seed traits, superior seed germplasm and effective use of crop protection solutions.

Pro forma net sales growth of 2 percent was led by volume gains of 1 percent and a 1 percent benefit from portfolio actions. Seed net sales grew 5 percent, driven by volume and price improvement, and Crop Protection net sales decreased 1 percent as increases in volume were more than offset by lower local price. Seed and Crop Protection volume growth was driven by an increase in sunflower and corn seed sales in Europe, increased soybean sales in U.S. & Canada, continued penetration of new crop protection products VESSARYA and ZORVEC TM fungicides and continued demand for ARYLEX TM herbicide, ISOCLAST insecticide, and novel seed treatment solutions. These volume increases were partially offset by higher Crop Protection inventory levels in China and a reduction in global corn planted area. Increases in local prices for Seeds, driven by continued penetration of LEPTRA corn hybrids, were offset by a decrease in local prices for Crop Protection, driven by competitive pressures in Latin America. The benefit from portfolio actions for 2017 as compared with 2016, is due to the DAS Divested Ag Business, which is excluded from pro forma results for periods prior to the Merger, but included in reported results after the Merger and through the close of the sale of this business on November 30, 2017. Pro forma Operating EBITDA was $2,611 million in 2017, up 12 percent from $2,322 million in 2016. Pro forma Operating EBITDA increased on improved volume, cost savings, lower pension/OPEB costs, currency and portfolio benefits. Increases were partially offset by lower local price due to competitive crop protection pricing pressure and higher product costs, including higher soybean royalties. 2016 Versus 2015 Agriculture net sales were $6,173 million in 2016, down 2 percent from $6,327 million in 2015. Compared with 2015, volume decreased 2 percent, currency declined 1 percent and local price and product mix was up 1 percent. Net sales declined in all geographic regions, except Latin America, as low crop commodity prices continued to drive a slow-growth agricultural industry. Crop Protection net sales decreased compared with 2015, driven primarily by reduced demand for insecticides and herbicides, primarily glyphosate, and currency headwinds. Seed net sales increased compared with 2015, as strong demand and price increases for corn seed in Latin America more than offset the impact of product lines divested in 2015 and lower demand for sunflower and cotton seed. Operating EBITDA for 2016 was $971 million, up from $833 million in 2015. Operating EBITDA increased as benefits from lower operating costs driven by productivity initiatives and increased corn seed sales more than offset lower sales of herbicides and insecticides and the absence of earnings from product lines divested in 2015. Agriculture Outlook for 2018 Agriculture's full year 2018 Operating EBITDA is expected to increase meaningfully, as compared with 2017 pro forma Operating EBITDA driven by favorable impacts on net sales from new product introductions and favorable impacts from cost synergies. The Company anticipates net sales for the first six months of 2018 to be about equal with the first six months of 2017, which is consistent with the estimated corn area planted in North America in 2018, and reflective of the challenging price environment. The Company anticipates an increase in the favorable impacts of cost synergies in the last six months of 2018 and expects new product introductions to be fully ramped and contributing to net sales and Operating EBITDA growth in the last six months of 2018. Additionally, the Company anticipates lower pension/OPEB costs to contribute to increases in Operating EBITDA. 48 Table of Contents PERFORMANCE MATERIALS & COATINGS The Performance Materials & Coatings segment consists of two global businesses - Coatings & Performance Monomers and Consumer Solutions.

Pro forma net sales were $22,392 million in 2017, up from $19,848 million in 2016. Pro forma net sales increased 13 percent from 2016 with local price up 8 percent and volume up 5 percent. Local price increased in all geographic regions and both businesses in response to higher feedstock, energy and other raw material costs. Double-digit price increases were reported in Hydrocarbons & Energy as a result of higher Brent crude oil prices, which increased approximately 22 percent compared with 2016. Local price also increased in the U.S. & Canada as a result of tight supply conditions due to hurricane-related disruptions. Volume increased in both businesses and across all geographic regions, except Latin America. Packaging and Specialty Plastics volume growth was driven by continued consumer-led demand in health and hygiene end-markets in the Americas, strong demand for food and specialty packaging solutions, particularly in Asia Pacific, and increased use of elastomers in packaging and footwear applications. Volume decreased for wire and cable applications as a result of hurricane-related supply disruptions. Volume growth in EMEA and Asia Pacific was enabled by an increase in production volume at Sadara. Hydrocarbons & Energy volume increased in all geographic regions, except Asia Pacific, primarily due to higher sales of ethylene and ethylene by-products enabled by the start-up of a world scale ethylene production facility in Texas in September 2017. Pro forma Operating EBITDA for 2017 was $4,698 million, down from $5,129 million in 2016. Pro forma Operating EBITDA decreased in 2017 as the impact of higher feedstock and energy costs, planned maintenance turnaround spending, increased U.S. Gulf Coast start-up and commissioning costs and hurricane-related expenses more than offset increased selling prices and higher equity earnings. 2016 Versus 2015 Packaging & Specialty Plastics net sales for 2016 were $18,404 million, essentially flat from $18,357 million in 2015. Volume increased 9 percent, local price decreased 8 percent and portfolio and other decreased 1 percent. Volume increased across all geographic regions and both businesses. Volume increased in Hydrocarbons & Energy due to third party supply agreements. Packaging and Specialty Plastics volume increased due to demand growth in industrial and consumer packaging and health and hygiene market sectors; increased use of elastomers in transportation, consumer goods and footwear market sectors; and continued demand for power cable installations and fiber optics. Volume growth in Asia Pacific was also enabled by new production from Sadara. Local price decreased across all geographic regions and both businesses in response to lower feedstock, energy and other raw material prices and competitive pricing pressures. Double-digit price declines were reported in Hydrocarbons & Energy as a 52 Table of Contents result of lower Brent crude oil prices, which declined approximately 16 percent compared with 2015. Portfolio actions decreased net sales by 1 percent, primarily reflecting the split-off of the chlorine value chain. Operating EBITDA for 2016 was $4,633 million, down from $4,812 million in 2015. Operating EBITDA decreased in 2016 as the impact of higher sales volume, lower feedstock, energy and other raw material costs and higher equity earnings from The SCG-Dow Group were more than offset by lower selling prices, lower equity earnings from EQUATE and increased equity losses from Sadara related to start-up expenses. Packaging & Specialty Plastics Outlook for 2018 Packaging & Specialty Plastics' 2018 Operating EBITDA is expected to increase meaningfully compared with 2017 pro forma Operating EBITDA, driven by the favorable impact of cost synergies and contributions from new capacity that will more than offset increased commissioning costs and increased feedstock and energy costs. In 2018, the Company expects crude oil prices, on average, to be higher than 2017. As a result, feedstock and energy costs are expected to be higher than 2017 levels. Global ethylene margins are expected to remain healthy in 2018, supported by demand growth as well as delays in new industry ethylene production capacity in the U.S. & Canada. Ethylene margins could vary materially from these expectations depending on global GDP rates, global operating rates and changes in global oil prices. Sales for the segment are expected to be flat compared with 2017 as increased sales in Packaging and Specialty Plastics are expected to offset declines in Hydrocarbons & Energy. Packaging and Specialty Plastics sales are expected to increase over the prior year driven by volume growth - reflecting a full year of Sadara volume, as all production facilities have commenced operations, and new capacity from Dow's U.S. Gulf Coast assets. Hydrocarbons & Energy sales are expected to decline as a result of higher crude oil and naphtha prices which will cause a shift to lighter cracker feedslates, resulting in lower production of ethylene by-products. Sales of ethylene are also expected to decline due to increased internal consumption as a result of the start-up of new Dow assets on the U.S. Gulf Coast. Price in both businesses is expected to be influenced by changes in feedstock costs. Current and Future Investments On September 21, 2017, Dow announced the startup of its new integrated, world-scale ethylene production facility and its new ELITE enhanced polyethylene production facility, both located in Freeport, Texas. These two key milestones enable the Company to capture benefits from increasing supplies of U.S. shale gas to deliver differentiated downstream solutions in its core market verticals. Dow is also building three new production facilities on the U.S. Gulf Coast which includes a Low Density Polyethylene (LDPE) production facility and a NORDEL Metallocene EPDM production which are expected to start up in early 2018, and a High Melt Index (HMI) AFFINITY Polymer production facility which is expected to startup in the second half of 2018.

Volume growth was led by Industrial Biosciences, driven by strong demand for microbial control solutions in energy markets, continued growth in biomaterials in apparel and carpet markets and growth in bioactives, primarily in the grain processing market. Volume in Nutrition & Health was flat as growth in probiotics and pharmaceuticals was offset by declines in protein solutions and systems and texturants due to weakness in packaged food markets and specific actions taken to exit low-margin market segments. The favorable impact from portfolio actions was driven by the acquisition of the FMC H&N Business. Pro forma Operating EBITDA was $1,302 million in 2017, up 6 percent from $1,227 million in 2016. The increase in pro forma Operating EBITDA was driven by cost savings, volume growth, lower pension/OPEB costs and favorable impacts of portfolio actions. Increases in pro forma Operating EBITDA were partially offset by the absence of a $27 million gain from a prior-year asset sale. 2016 Versus 2015 Nutrition & Biosciences net sales were $975 million in 2016, down from $1,029 million in 2015. Net sales decreased 5 percent compared with 2015, with local price and product mix down 3 percent and volume down 2 percent. Local price declined in Industrial Biosciences across all geographic regions due to weakness in the energy sector, primarily in U.S. & Canada. Local price was also down in Nutrition & Health across all geographic regions, except Latin America. Volume was flat in Industrial Biosciences and down in Nutrition & Health. Nutrition & Health volume declined due to customer de-stocking of cellulosics used in pharmaceutical applications, primarily in U.S. & Canada, and from the shutdown of a cellulosics facility in Institute, West Virginia, in the fourth quarter of 2015. Operating EBITDA was $141 million in 2016, compared with $130 million in 2015. Operating EBITDA increased in 2016 as lower operating expenses, lower R&D and SG&A spending, and higher equity earnings more than offset the impact of lower selling prices. 55 Table of Contents Nutrition & Biosciences Outlook for 2018 Nutrition & Biosciences' 2018 Operating EBITDA is expected to increase notably, as compared with 2017 pro forma Operating EBITDA driven by a favorable portfolio impact of the acquisition of the H&N Business, volume growth, lower pension/OPEB costs, the favorable impacts of cost synergies and higher local prices. The Company anticipates a continued competitive market environment with lower food ingredient demand in select US markets, some global price pressure originating from cost focused customers, growth in the pharmaceutical global oral solid dosage excipient market, and expects the enzymes market to grow on pace with gross domestic product ( GDP ). Additionally, the Company expects higher oil prices to continue, driving higher demand of microbial control products, and continued high growth in the apparel markets.

Transportation & Advanced Polymers In millions 2017 2016 2015 Net sales $ 2,521 $ 897 $ 583 Pro forma net sales $ 5,131 $ 4,497 Operating EBITDA $ 287 $ 156 Pro forma Operating EBITDA $ 1,319 $ 1,045 Equity earnings (losses) $ (1 ) $ 8 $ 20 Transportation & Advanced Polymers Percentage change from prior year 2017 2016 2015 Change in Net Sales from Prior Period due to: Local price & product mix % (1 )% % Currency (1 ) (7 ) Volume 6 7 5 Portfolio & other 175 49 Total 181 % 54 % (2 )% Change in Pro Forma Net Sales from Prior Period due to: Local price & product mix 2 % Currency Volume 7 Portfolio & other 5 Total 14 % 2017 Versus 2016 Transportation & Advanced Polymers net sales were $2,521 million in 2017, up from $897 million in 2016. Pro forma net sales were $5,131 million in 2017, up from $4,497 million in 2016. Pro forma net sales growth of 14 percent, with gains across all geographies, was led by increased volume of 7 percent , a favorable impact from portfolio actions of 5 percent and a 2 percent increase in local price. Broad based volume growth was driven by increased demand for polymers in automotive, electronics and industrial markets leading to growth from KALREZ and VESPEL high-performance parts. Volume growth was led by Asia Pacific followed by EMEA, U.S. & Canada and Latin America. The increase in local price was driven by price gains in polymers in automotive markets. The favorable impact from portfolio actions relates to the addition of Dow Corning's silicones business in June 2016. Pro forma Operating EBITDA was $1,319 million in 2017, up 26 percent from $1,045 million in 2016. The increase in Operating EBITDA was driven by increased volume growth, the favorable impact of earnings from Dow Corning's silicones business, higher local selling prices, cost savings and lower pension/OPEB costs, partially offset by higher raw material costs. 56 Table of Contents 2016 Versus 2015 Transportation & Advanced Polymers net sales in 2016 were $897 million, up from $583 million in 2015. Net sales increased 54 percent from 2015, primarily due to a 49 percent increase in portfolio and other, reflecting the favorable impact of the addition of Dow Corning's silicones business. Volume increased 7 percent and local price and product mix and currency both decreased 1 percent. Volume increased across all geographic regions, particularly in Asia Pacific, led by strong demand for structural and elastic adhesives used in automotive applications. Local price and product mix declined across all geographic regions in response to lower raw material costs. Currency had an unfavorable impact to sales, driven by EMEA. Operating EBITDA in 2016 was $287 million, up from $156 million in 2015. Operating EBITDA increased as the favorable impact from the Dow Corning silicones business, lower feedstock, energy and other raw material costs and higher sales volume more than offset lower selling prices. Transportation & Advanced Polymers Outlook for 2018 Transportation & Advanced Polymers' 2018 Operating EBITDA is expected to increase meaningfully as compared with 2017 pro forma Operating EBITDA, driven by lower pension/OPEB costs, the favorable impacts of cost synergies, improved volumes and an increase in local price, partially offset by a negative impact from portfolio actions. It is anticipated that global automotive production, according to IHS, will continue to grow at 2 percent along with modest growth in the semiconductor and medical markets. The portfolio impact relates to the expected sale of DuPont Teijin Films, subject to regulatory approval.

Safety & Construction In millions 2017 2016 2015 Net sales $ 3,006 $ 1,877 $ 1,938 Pro forma net sales $ 5,142 $ 4,984 Operating EBITDA $ 415 $ 400 Pro forma Operating EBITDA $ 1,190 $ 1,130 Equity earnings $ 2 $ 1 $ 1 Safety & Construction Percentage change from prior year 2017 2016 2015 Change in Net Sales from Prior Period due to: Local price & product mix % (1 )% % Currency (5 ) Volume 3 (2 ) 2 Portfolio & other 57 Total 60 % (3 )% (3 )% Change in Pro Forma Net Sales from Prior Period due to: Local price & product mix (1 )% Currency Volume 4 Portfolio & other Total 3 % 2017 Versus 2016 Safety & Construction net sales were $3,006 million in 2017, up from $1,877 million in the 2016. Pro forma net sales were $5,142 million in 2017, up 3 percent from $4,984 million in 2016. Pro forma net sales growth was led by volume gains of 4 percent , slightly offset by a 1 percent decline in local price. Continued demand from industrial markets contributed to gains in NOMEX 57 Table of Contents thermal-resistant garments, KEVLAR high-strength materials and water filtration. Growth in TYVEK protective materials reflected increased demand in industrial markets, construction and medical packaging. Declines in local price and product mix, primarily in aramids, were partially offset by pricing gains in building solutions. Regionally, volume gains were driven by Asia Pacific and EMEA followed by U.S. & Canada and Latin America. Drivers included TYVEK for graphics and house wrap in EMEA, and gains from KEVLAR in Asia Pacific. Pro forma Operating EBITDA was $1,190 million in 2017, up 5 percent from $1,130 million in 2016. Pro forma Operating EBITDA increased as volume growth, lower pension/OPEB costs and cost savings were partially offset by the impact of lower local selling price and higher raw material costs. 2016 Versus 2015 Safety & Construction net sales were $1,877 million in 2016, down from $1,938 million in 2015. Net sales decreased 3 percent compared with 2015, with volume down 2 percent and local price and product mix down 1 percent. Volume decreased in all geographic regions, except Latin America, primarily in response to soft demand for reverse osmosis membranes used in industrial applications. Price was down in all geographic regions, primarily in response to lower raw material costs. Operating EBITDA was $415 million in 2016, compared with $400 million in 2015. Operating EBITDA increased in 2016 as lower operating expenses more than offset the impact of lower selling prices and decreased sales volume. Safety & Construction Outlook for 2018 Safety & Construction's 2018 Operating EBITDA is expected to increase notably as compared with 2017 pro forma Operating EBITDA, driven by lower pension/OPEB costs, improved plant performance, the favorable impacts of cost synergies and improved volumes. For 2018, the Company anticipates increased demand across all regions in industrial, construction and water filtration markets with demand for aramids and thermal apparel remaining strong. These market increases are expected to contribute to improved volumes, primarily in TYVEK protective materials, building solutions and water filtration. CORPORATE Corporate includes certain enterprise and governance activities (including insurance operations, environmental operations, geographic management, etc.); business incubation platforms; non-business aligned joint ventures; gains and losses on the sales of financial assets; severance costs; non-business aligned litigation expenses; discontinued or non-aligned businesses and pre commercial activities. Corporate In millions 2017 2016 2015 Net sales $ 387 $ 281 $ 349 Pro forma net sales $ 393 $ 294 Operating EBITDA $ (173 ) $ (257 ) Pro forma Operating EBITDA $ (843 ) $ (812 ) Equity losses $ (11 ) $ (28 ) $ (69 ) 2017 Versus 2016 Net sales for Corporate, which primarily relate to insurance operations, were $387 million in 2017, up from $281 million in 2016. Pro forma net sales for 2017 were $393 million, up from $294 million in 2016. Pro forma Operating EBITDA in 2017 was a loss of $843 million, compared with a loss of $812 million in 2016. Compared with 2016, pro forma Operating EBITDA decreased, primarily due to lower gains on asset sales and higher discontinued business costs, which were partially offset by lower pre-commercial expenses. 2016 Versus 2015 Net sales for Corporate were $281 million in 2016, down from $349 million in 2015. Net sales declined in 2016, primarily due to the divestiture of the AgroFresh business in the third quarter of 2015. Operating EBITDA in 2016 was a loss of $173 million, compared with a loss of $257 million in 2015. Operating EBITDA improved in 2016 as lower asbestos-related defense costs resulting from a change in accounting policy and lower performance-based compensation costs more than offset the absence of earnings from the divestiture of the AgroFresh business. 58 Table of Contents LIQUIDITY AND CAPITAL RESOURCES The Company had cash and cash equivalents and marketable securities of $14,394 million at December 31, 2017 and $6,607 million at December 31, 2016 , of which $12,177 million at December 31, 2017 and $4,890 million at December 31, 2016 , was held by subsidiaries in foreign countries, including United States territories. For each of its foreign subsidiaries, the Company makes an assertion regarding the amount of earnings intended for permanent reinvestment, with the balance available to be repatriated to the United States. The Tax Cuts and Jobs Act ( The Act ) requires companies to pay a one-time transition tax on the earnings of foreign subsidiaries, a portion of which were previously considered permanently reinvested by the Company (see Note 8 to the Consolidated Financial Statements for additional details on The Act). The cash held by foreign subsidiaries for permanent reinvestment is generally used to finance the Subsidiaries' operational activities and future foreign investments. The Company is currently evaluating the impact of The Act on its permanent reinvestment assertion. In addition to the one-time transition tax, a deferred tax liability for withholding taxes has been accrued on a portion of unrepatriated earnings at December 31, 2017. At December 31, 2017, management believed that sufficient liquidity was available in the United States. In the event that additional foreign funds are needed in the United States, the Company has the ability to repatriate additional funds. The repatriation could result in an adjustment to the tax liability due to contributing factors such as withholding taxes, income taxes and the impact of foreign currency movements. As such, it is not practicable to calculate the unrecognized deferred tax liability on undistributed foreign earnings. The Company cash flows from operating, investing and financing activities, as reflected in the consolidated statements of cash flows, are summarized in the following table: Cash Flow Summary In millions 2017 2016 2015 Cash provided by (used for): Operating activities $ 8,695 $ 5,600 $ 7,607 Investing activities 4,274 (3,479 ) (1,350 ) Financing activities (6,523 ) (4,014 ) (3,132 ) Effect of exchange rate changes on cash 297 (77 ) (202 ) Cash reclassified as held for sale 88 Summary Increase (decrease) in cash and cash equivalents $ 6,831 $ (1,970 ) $ 2,923 Cash and cash equivalents at beginning of year 6,607 8,577 5,654 Cash and cash equivalents at end of year $ 13,438 $ 6,607 $ 8,577 Cash Flows from Operating Activities Cash provided by operating activities increased in 2017 compared with 2016 , primarily driven by higher cash earnings, advance payments from customers in the Agriculture segment and customers with long-term ethylene supply agreements, a tax refund related to a voluntary pension contribution, and a one-time cash receipt related to the Nova patent infringement award. These items were partially offset by a reduction in balances in accounts receivable securitization facilities, increased pension contributions resulting from a change in control provision in a Dow non-qualified U.S. pension plan, higher integration and separation costs and a cash payment related to the Bayer CropScience arbitration matter. Cash provided by operating activities decreased in 2016 compared with 2015 , primarily due to cash payments related to the settlement of the urethane matters class action lawsuit and opt out cases, increased integration and separation costs, a cash payment related to the settlement of an uncertain tax position and a one-time payment related to the termination of a terminal use agreement. Net Working Capital at Dec 31 In millions 2017 2016 Current assets $ 49,893 $ 23,659 Current liabilities 26,128 12,604 Net working capital $ 23,765 $ 11,055 Current ratio 1.91:1 1.88:1 Net working capital increased from December 31, 2016 to December 31, 2017, primarily related to the impact of the Merger. See Note 3 to the Consolidated Financial Statements for additional information on the Merger. 59 Table of Contents Cash Flows from Investing Activities Cash provided by investing activities in 2017 was primarily from cash acquired in the Merger, proceeds from sales and maturities of investments and divestitures, including the divestitures of the DAS Divested Ag Business, the EAA Business and certain assets related to DuPont's crop protection business and R&D organization. These items were partially offset by capital expenditures, purchases of investments, payments to a trust related to certain non-qualified benefit and deferred compensation plans as a result of the Merger and loans to nonconsolidated affiliates, primarily with Sadara. Cash used for investing activities in 2016 was primarily for capital expenditures as well as investments in and loans to nonconsolidated affiliates, primarily with Sadara, which were partially offset by net cash acquired in the Dow Corning ownership restructure. Cash used for investing activities in 2015 was primarily for capital expenditures; purchases of investments, including the repayment of outstanding loans issued under company-owned life insurance policies; and investments in and loans made to nonconsolidated affiliates, primarily with Sadara. This was partially offset by proceeds received from divestitures, including the divestitures of ANGUS Chemical Company and the AgroFresh business, proceeds from the sale of Dow's interest in MEGlobal and proceeds from sales and maturities of investments. In 2017, Dow loaned $735 million to Sadara and converted $718 million to equity. Dow had a note receivable from Sadara of $275 million at December 31, 2017. Dow loaned $1,015 million to Sadara and converted $1,230 million to equity during 2016, and had a note receivable from Sadara of $258 million at December 31, 2016. All or a portion of the outstanding loan to Sadara could potentially be converted to equity in future periods. Dow expects to loan between zero and $200 million to Sadara in 2018. See Note 12 to the Consolidated Financial Statements for additional information. On August 28, 2017, Dow and Saudi Aramco announced a non-binding Memorandum of Understanding that sets forth a process for Dow to acquire an additional 15 percent ownership interest in Sadara from Saudi Aramco. The current equity ownership split is 65 percent Saudi Aramco and 35 percent Dow. If the potential transaction is concluded as presently proposed, Dow and Saudi Aramco would each hold a 50 percent equity stake in Sadara. The Company's capital expenditures, including capital expenditures of consolidated variable interest entities, were $3,570 million in 2017, $3,804 million in 2016 and $3,703 million in 2015. The Company expects capital spending in 2018 to be approximately $4.2 billion to $4.4 billion. In addition, the Company expects approximately $600 million of additional capital spending for targeted cost synergy and business separation projects. Cash Flows from Financing Activities Cash used for financing activities in 2017 included dividends paid to stockholders, repurchases of DowDuPont common stock and payments of notes payable and long-term debt. Cash used for financing activities in 2016 included dividends paid to stockholders (including the accelerated payment of the fourth quarter preferred dividend), repurchases of Dow common stock and payments of long-term debt. Cash used for financing activities in 2015 included dividends paid to stockholders, repurchases of Dow common stock and payments of long-term debt, including the early redemption of International Notes ("InterNotes") which was partially offset by proceeds from the issuance of long-term debt, including debt related to the split-off of the chlorine value chain. See Notes 15 and 17 to the Consolidated Financial Statements for additional information related to the issuance or retirement of debt and the share repurchase program, respectively, and Note 6 for information on the split-off of the chlorine value chain. Free Cash Flow The Company defines free cash flow as cash provided by operating activities less capital expenditures. Under this definition, free cash flow represents the cash that remains available to the Company, after investing in its asset base, to fund obligations using the Company's primary source of incremental liquidity - cash provided by operating activities. Free cash flow is an integral financial measure used in the Company's financial planning process. This financial measure is not recognized in accordance with U.S. GAAP and should not be viewed as an alternative to U.S. GAAP financial measures of performance. All companies do not calculate non-GAAP financial measures in the same manner and, accordingly, the Company's free cash flow definition may not be consistent with the methodologies used by other companies. For further information relating to the change in cash provided by operating activities, see the discussion above under the section entitled "Cash Flows from Operating Activities." Reconciliation of "Cash Provided by Operating Activities" to Free Cash Flow In millions 2017 2016 2015 Cash provided by operating activities $ 8,695 $ 5,600 $ 7,607 Capital expenditures (3,570 ) (3,804 ) (3,703 ) Free Cash Flow $ 5,125 $ 1,796 $ 3,904 60 Table of Contents Liquidity & Financial Flexibility The Company primary source of incremental liquidity is cash provided by operating activities. The generation of cash from operations and each of Dow's and DuPont's (the "Subsidiaries") ability to access the commercial paper market, the long-term debt market, syndicated credit lines, bilateral credit lines and bank financing, including committed repurchase facilities, are expected to meet the Company cash requirements for working capital, capital expenditures, debt maturities, dividend payments, share repurchases, contributions to pension plans and other needs. The Company primary liquidity sources are through the Subsidiaries as discussed below. Management expects that the Company and each of the Subsidiaries will continue to have sufficient liquidity and financial flexibility to meet respective business obligations as they come due. Dow's Liquidity Sources Credit Ratings At January 31, 2018, Dow's credit ratings were as follows: Credit Ratings Long-Term Rating Short-Term Rating Outlook Standard & Poor BBB A-2 Stable Moody Investors Service Baa2 P-2 Stable Fitch Ratings BBB F2 Watch Positive Downgrades in Dow's credit ratings would increase borrowing costs on certain indentures and could impact its ability to access credit markets. Commercial Paper - Dow Dow issues promissory notes under U.S. and Euromarket commercial paper programs. At December 31, 2017, Dow had $231 million of commercial paper outstanding (zero at December 31, 2016). Dow maintains access to the commercial paper market at competitive rates. Amounts outstanding under Dow's commercial paper programs during the period may be greater, or less, than the amount reported at the end of the period. Subsequent to December 31, 2017, Dow issued approximately $700 million of commercial paper that remains outstanding at February 15, 2018. Committed Credit Facilities - Dow In the event the Company has short-term liquidity needs, it can access liquidity through Dow's committed and available credit facilities. At December 31, 2017, Dow had total committed credit facilities of $10.9 billion and available credit facilities of $6.4 billion . See Note 15 to the Consolidated Financial Statements for additional information on committed and available credit facilities. In connection with the Dow Corning ownership restructure, on May 31, 2016, Dow Corning incurred $4.5 billion of indebtedness under a certain third party credit agreement ("DCC Term Loan Facility"). Dow subsequently guaranteed the obligations of Dow Corning under the DCC Term Loan Facility and, as a result, the covenants and events of default applicable to the DCC Term Loan Facility are substantially similar to the covenants and events of default set forth in Dow's Five Year Competitive Advance and Revolving Credit Facility. In the second quarter of 2017, Dow Corning exercised a 364-day extension option making amounts borrowed under the DCC Term Loan Facility repayable on May 29, 2018, and amended the DCC Term Loan Facility to include an additional 19-month extension option, at Dow Corning's election, upon satisfaction of certain customary conditions precedent. On February 8, 2018, Dow Corning delivered a notice of intent to exercise the 19-month extension option on the DCC Term Loan Facility. Uncommitted Credit Facilities and Outstanding Letters of Credit - Dow Dow had uncommitted credit facilities in the form of unused bank credit lines of approximately $2,853 million at December 31, 2017 . These lines can be used to support short-term liquidity needs and general purposes, including letters of credit. Dow had outstanding letters of credit of $433 million at December 31, 2017 . These letters of credit support commitments made in the ordinary course of business. Accounts Receivable Securitization Facilities - Dow Dow has access to committed accounts receivable securitization facilities in the United States and Europe, from which amounts available for funding are based upon available and eligible accounts receivable within each of the facilities. Dow renewed the United States facility in June 2015 for a term that extends to June 2018. The Europe facility was renewed in July 2015 for a term that extends to July 2018. 61 Table of Contents In the fourth quarter of 2017, Dow suspended further sales of trade accounts receivable through these facilities and began reducing outstanding balances under these facilities through collections of trade accounts receivable previously sold to such conduits. Dow has the ability to resume such sales to the conduits, subject to certain prior notice requirements, at the discretion of Dow. See Note 14 to the Consolidated Financial Statements for further information. DuPont's Liquidity Sources Credit Ratings At January 31, 2018, DuPont's credit ratings were as follows: Credit Ratings Long-Term Rating Short-Term Rating Outlook Standard & Poor A- A-2 Stable Moody Investors Service A3 P-2 Negative Fitch Ratings A F1 Watch Negative Downgrades in DuPont's credit ratings would increase borrowing costs on certain indentures and could impact its ability to access debt capital markets. Commercial Paper - DuPont DuPont issues promissory notes under U.S. commercial paper programs. At December 31, 2017 , DuPont had $1,436 million of commercial paper outstanding. DuPont maintains access to the commercial paper market at competitive rates. Committed Credit Facilities - DuPont In the event the Company has short-term liquidity needs, it can access liquidity through DuPont's committed and available credit facilities. At December 31, 2017 , DuPont had total committed credit facilities of $7.5 billion under its Term Loan Facility and amended revolving credit facility (the "RCF") with remaining available credit facilities of $6.0 billion. See Note 15 to the Consolidated Financial Statements for additional information. Term Loan Facility - DuPont In March 2016, DuPont entered into a credit agreement that provides for a three-year, senior unsecured term loan facility in the aggregate principal amount of $4.5 billion (the "Term Loan Facility") under which DuPont may make up to seven term loan borrowings and amounts repaid or prepaid are not available for subsequent borrowings. The facility was amended in 2017 to extend the date on which the commitment to lend terminates to July 27, 2018. The proceeds from the borrowings under the Term Loan Facility will be used for DuPont's general corporate purposes including debt repayment, working capital and funding a portion of DowDuPont's costs and expenses. The Term Loan Facility matures in March 2019, unless extended by mutual agreement, at which time all outstanding borrowings, including accrued but unpaid interest, become immediately due and payable. At December 31, 2017, DuPont had made three term loan borrowings in an aggregate principal amount of $1.5 billion and had unused commitments of $3 billion under the Term Loan Facility. Uncommitted Credit Facilities and Outstanding Letters of Credit - DuPont DuPont had uncommitted credit facilities in the form of unused bank credit lines of approximately $731 million at December 31, 2017 . These lines can be used to support short-term liquidity needs and general corporate purposes, including letters of credit. DuPont had outstanding letters of credit of $177 million at December 31, 2017 . These letters of credit support commitments made in the ordinary course of business. Debt The Company public debt instruments and primary, private credit agreements (collectively "Debt Instruments") reside with the Subsidiaries. See Note 15 to the Consolidated Financial Statements for information related to the Subsidiaries' notes payable and long-term debt activity, including debt retired and issued. The following table reflects the debt of the Subsidiaries: Total Debt Dec 31, 2017 Dec 31, 2016 In millions Dow DuPont Total Notes payable $ 484 $ 1,464 $ 1,948 $ 272 Long-term debt due within one year 752 1,315 2,067 635 Long-term debt 19,765 10,291 30,056 20,456 Total debt $ 21,001 $ 13,070 $ 34,071 $ 21,363 62 Table of Contents The Debt Instruments of the Subsidiaries contain, among other provisions, certain customary restrictive covenant and default provisions. Dow Five Year Competitive Advance and Revolving Credit Facility contains a financial covenant that Dow must maintain its ratio of consolidated indebtedness to its consolidated capitalization at no greater than 0.65 to 1.00 at any time the aggregate outstanding amount of loans under the Five Year Competitive Advance and Revolving Credit Facility equals or exceeds $500 million. The ratio of Dow consolidated indebtedness to its consolidated capitalization was 0.43 to 1.00 at December 31, 2017 . DuPont Term Loan Facility and RCF contain a financial covenant requiring that the ratio of total indebtedness to total capitalization for DuPont and its consolidated subsidiaries not exceed 0.6667 to 1.00. At December 31, 2017 , management believes each of the Subsidiaries were in compliance with all of their respective covenants and default provisions. For information on the Subsidiaries' covenants and default provisions, see Note 15 to the Consolidated Financial Statements. Dividends The following table provides dividends paid to common and preferred shareholders for the years ended December 31, 2017 , 2016 and 2015 : Dividends Paid for the years ended Dec 31 In millions, except per share amounts 2017 2016 2015 Dividends paid, per common share 1 $ 2.22 $ 1.84 $ 1.68 Dividends paid to common stockholders 2 $ 3,394 $ 2,037 $ 1,913 Dividends paid to preferred shareholders 3 $ $ 425 $ 340 1. The 2017 dividend is comprised of $0.38 per share of DowDuPont dividends declared and paid in the fourth quarter of 2017 and the remaining amount relates to payments of Dow dividends declared prior to the Merger. 2. The 2017 dividend consists of $885 million paid to DowDuPont common stockholders for dividends declared after the Merger, as well as $2,179 million paid to Dow common stockholders for dividends declared prior to the Merger, and $330 million paid to DuPont common stockholders after the Merger for dividends declared prior to the Merger. 3. Dividends paid to Dow preferred shareholders in 2016 includes payment of the fourth quarter 2016 declared dividend. On December 30, 2016, Dow converted all outstanding shares of its Dow Preferred Stock into shares of Dow's common stock. As a result of this conversion, no shares of Dow Preferred Stock are issued or outstanding. Share Repurchase Program On November 2, 2017, the Company announced the Board authorized an initial $4 billion share repurchase program, which has no expiration date. At December 31, 2017, the Company had spent $1 billion on repurchases of DowDuPont common stock under the program. Although there is no timeline to complete the share repurchase program, DowDuPont intends to repurchase approximately $1.0 billion of the Company's stock in the first quarter of 2018. In connection with the Merger, Dow's $9.5 billion share repurchase program was canceled. At the time of cancellation, Dow had spent $8.1 billion on repurchases of Dow common stock under the share buyback program. For additional information related to the share repurchase program, see Part II. Item 5. Market for Registrant's Common Equity, Related Stockholder Matters and Issuer Purchases of Equity Securities and Note 17 to the Consolidated Financial Statements. Rabbi Trust DuPont entered into a trust agreement in 2013 (as amended and restated in 2017) that established and requires DuPont to fund a trust (the "Trust") for cash obligations under certain non-qualified benefit and deferred compensation plans upon a change in control event as defined in the Trust agreement. Under the Trust agreement, the consummation of the Merger was a change in control event. As a result, in November 2017, DuPont contributed $571 million to the Trust. In the fourth quarter of 2017, $13 million was distributed to DuPont according to the Trust agreement and at December 31, 2017, the balance in the Trust was $558 million. Pension Plans Dow and DuPont did not merge their pension plans and other postretirement benefit plans as a result of the Merger. Dow and DuPont have defined benefit pension plans in the United States and a number of other countries. Dow and DuPont funding policies are to contribute to defined benefit pension plans in the United States and a number of other countries based on pension funding laws and local country requirements. Contributions exceeding funding requirements may and have been made at Dow and DuPont discretion. In 2017 , 2016 and 2015 , Dow contributed approximately $1,676 million, $629 million and $844 million to its pension plans, respectively, including contributions to fund benefit payments for its non-qualified pension plans. DuPont contributed $68 million post-Merger to its pension plans, including contributions to fund benefit payments for its non-qualified pension plans. Dow expects to contribute approximately $500 million to its pension plans and DuPont expects to contribute approximately $200 million to its pension plans in 2018 . See Note 19 to the Consolidated Financial Statements for additional information concerning the Company pension plans. 63 Table of Contents Dow The provisions of a U.S. non-qualified pension plan for Dow require the payment of plan obligations to certain participants upon a change in control of Dow, which occurred at the time of the Merger. Certain participants could elect to receive a lump-sum payment or direct Dow to purchase an annuity on their behalf using the after-tax proceeds of the lump sum. In the fourth quarter of 2017, Dow paid $940 million to plan participants and $230 million to an insurance company for the purchase of annuities, which were included in "Pension contributions" in the consolidated statements of cash flows. Dow also paid $205 million for income and payroll taxes for participants electing the annuity option. Dow recorded a settlement charge of $687 million associated with the payout in the fourth quarter of 2017. DuPont Prior to the Merger, DuPont made total contributions of $2.9 billion to its principal U.S pension plan in 2017, reflecting discretionary contributions. The $2.9 billion contribution was taken as a deduction on DuPont 2016 federal tax return and resulted in a net operating loss for tax purposes. This loss generated an overpayment of taxes of approximately $800 million. A portion of the overpayment will be applied against the current year tax liability. The remainder of the loss generated a refund of approximately $700 million, which was received during the fourth quarter of 2017. Restructuring, Goodwill Impairment and Asset Related Charges - Net DowDuPont Cost Synergy Program The activities related to the DowDuPont Cost Synergy Program ("Synergy Program") are expected to result in additional cash expenditures of approximately $1,175 million to $1,315 million , primarily by the end of 2019, consisting of severance and related benefit costs and costs associated with exit and disposal activities, including environmental remediation (see Note 5 to the Consolidated Financial Statements). The Synergy Program includes certain asset actions, including strategic decisions regarding the cellulosic biofuel business reflected in the preliminary fair value measurement of DuPont assets as of the Merger date. Current estimated total pretax restructuring charges could be impacted by future adjustments to the preliminary fair value of DuPont assets. The Company expects to incur additional costs in the future related to its restructuring activities. Future costs are expected to include demolition costs related to closed facilities and restructuring plan implementation costs; these costs will be recognized as incurred. The Company also expects to incur additional employee-related costs, including involuntary termination benefits, related to its other optimization activities. These costs cannot be reasonably estimated at this time. Restructuring Plans Initiated Prior to Merger The activities related to Dow's 2016 restructuring plan are expected to result in additional cash expenditures of approximately $70 million, primarily through June 30, 2018, consisting of severance and related benefit costs and costs associated with exit and disposal activities, including environmental remediation (see Note 5 to the Consolidated Financial Statements). 64 Table of Contents Contractual Obligations The following table summarizes the Subsidiaries' contractual obligations, commercial commitments and expected cash requirements for interest at December 31, 2017 . Additional information related to these obligations can be found in Notes 15 , 16 and 19 to the Consolidated Financial Statements. Contractual Obligations Payments Due In In millions 2018 2019-2020 2021-2022 2023 & Beyond Total Long-term debt obligations 1 $ 2,038 $ 13,776 $ 4,577 $ 11,585 $ 31,976 Expected cash requirements for interest 2 1,387 2,055 1,404 7,622 12,468 Pension and other postretirement benefits 1,082 1,740 2,534 13,728 19,084 Operating leases 614 903 630 1,186 3,333 Purchase obligations 3 3,790 5,394 4,284 7,120 20,588 Other noncurrent obligations 4 471 1,931 1,086 2,443 5,931 Total contractual obligations $ 9,382 $ 25,799 $ 14,515 $ 43,684 $ 93,380 1. Excludes unamortized debt discount and issuance costs of $346 million and unamortized debt step-up premium of $492 million . Includes capital lease obligations of $287 million . Assumes the option to extend the DCC Term Loan facility will be exercised. 2. Cash requirements for interest on long-term debt was calculated using current interest rates at December 31, 2017 and includes $5,163 million of various floating rate notes. 3. Includes take-or-pay and throughput obligations, outstanding purchase orders and other commitments greater than $1 million obtained through a survey conducted by the Subsidiaries. 4. Includes liabilities related to asbestos litigation, environmental remediation, legal settlements and other noncurrent liabilities. The table also includes future payments under DuPont Pioneer license agreements of $1,173 million on an undiscounted basis ( $1,079 million on a discounted basis). The table excludes uncertain tax positions due to uncertainties in the timing of the effective settlement of tax positions with the respective taxing authorities and deferred tax liabilities as it is impractical to determine whether there will be a cash impact related to these liabilities. The table also excludes deferred revenue as it does not represent future cash requirements arising from contractual payment obligations. The Subsidiaries expect to meet their contractual obligations through their normal sources of liquidity and believe they have the financial resources to satisfy these contractual obligations. Off-balance Sheet Arrangements Off-balance sheet arrangements are obligations the Company has with nonconsolidated entities related to transactions, agreements or other contractual arrangements. The Company holds variable interests in joint ventures accounted for under the equity method of accounting. The Company is not the primary beneficiary of these joint ventures and therefore is not required to consolidate the entities (see Note 23 to the Consolidated Financial Statements). In addition, see Note 14 to the Consolidated Financial Statements for information regarding the transfer of financial assets. Guarantees arise during the ordinary course of business from relationships with customers and nonconsolidated affiliates when the Subsidiaries undertake an obligation to guarantee the performance of others if specific triggering events occur. The Subsidiaries had combined outstanding guarantees at December 31, 2017 of $5,960 million , compared with $6,043 million of outstanding guarantees of Dow at December 31, 2016. Additional information related to the guarantees of the Subsidiaries can be found in the Guarantees section of Note 16 to the Consolidated Financial Statements. Fair Value Measurements See Note 19 to the Consolidated Financial Statements for information related to fair value measurements of pension and other postretirement benefit plan assets; see Note 21 for information related to other-than-temporary impairments; and, see Note 22 for additional information concerning fair value measurements, including the Company interests held in trade receivable conduits. OUTLOOK The trajectory of global economic expansion has gained momentum - driven by robust fundamentals in consumer and business confidence, employment and wage growth and manufacturing and infrastructure investment activity. In developed economies in particular, such as the United States, Germany, France, Canada and the U.K., DowDuPont continues to see strong leading indicators of broad-based growth. Furthermore, early signs from the business community point to U.S. tax reform as a catalyst for further domestic capital investments, which will take advantage of enhanced competitiveness and pro-business incentives. Adding to this, the emerging middle class in developing economies, most notably in India and China, but also in Africa and the Middle East, continues to support sustainable growth. All of this bodes well for the products and technologies within DowDuPont portfolio, which are well positioned to meet growing needs in the Materials Science, Agriculture and Specialty Product sectors. Looking ahead, DowDuPont's levers of value creation 65 Table of Contents are clear: continuing to further unlock the cost and growth synergies of this merger transaction; capitalizing on the Company's early success and achieving the enhanced cost synergy commitment; delivering new products from the Company's in-flight growth investments and powerful innovation pipeline; and quickly standing and separating into three industry-leading companies. OTHER MATTERS Critical Accounting Estimates The preparation of financial statements and related disclosures in conformity with U.S. GAAP requires management to make judgments, assumptions and estimates that affect the amounts reported in the consolidated financial statements and accompanying notes. Note 1 to the Consolidated Financial Statements describes the significant accounting policies and methods used in the preparation of the consolidated financial statements. DowDuPont accounting policies that are impacted by judgments, assumptions and estimates are described below. Litigation The Company and its subsidiaries are subject to legal proceedings and claims arising out of the normal course of business including product liability, patent infringement, governmental regulation, contract and commercial litigation, and other actions. The Company routinely assesses the legal and factual circumstances of each matter, the likelihood of any adverse outcomes to these matters, as well as ranges of probable losses. A determination of the amount of the reserves required, if any, for these contingencies is made after thoughtful analysis of each known claim. The Company has an active risk management program consisting of numerous insurance policies secured from many carriers covering various timeframes. These policies may provide coverage that could be utilized to minimize the financial impact, if any, of certain contingencies. The required reserves may change in the future due to new developments in each matter. For further discussion see Note 16 to the Consolidated Financial Statements. Asbestos-Related Matters of Union Carbide Corporation Union Carbide is and has been involved in a large number of asbestos-related suits filed primarily in state courts during the past four decades. These suits principally allege personal injury resulting from exposure to asbestos-containing products and frequently seek both actual and punitive damages. The alleged claims primarily relate to products that Union Carbide sold in the past, alleged exposure to asbestos-containing products located on Union Carbide premises, and Union Carbide responsibility for asbestos suits filed against a former Union Carbide subsidiary, Amchem Products, Inc. ("Amchem"). Each year, Ankura Consulting Group, LLC ("Ankura") performs a review for Union Carbide based upon historical asbestos claims, resolution and historical defense spending. Union Carbide compares current asbestos claim, resolution and defense spending activity with the results of the most recent Ankura study at each balance sheet date to determine whether the asbestos-related liability continues to be appropriate. In 2016, Dow and Union Carbide elected to change their method of accounting for Union Carbide's asbestos-related defense and processing costs from expensing as incurred to estimating and accruing a liability. In addition to performing their annual review of pending and future asbestos claim resolution activity, Ankura also performed a review of Union Carbide's asbestos-related defense and processing costs to determine a reasonable estimate of future defense and processing costs to be included in the asbestos-related liability, through the terminal year of 2049. For additional information, see Part I, Item 3. Legal Proceedings; Asbestos-Related Matters of Union Carbide Corporation in Management's Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations; and Notes 1 and 16 to the Consolidated Financial Statements. Environmental Matters Accruals for environmental matters are recorded when it is probable that a liability has been incurred and the amount of the liability can be reasonably estimated. At December 31, 2017, the Company had accrued obligations of $1,311 million for probable environmental remediation and restoration costs, including $219 million for the remediation of Superfund sites. As remediation activities vary substantially in duration and cost from site to site, it is difficult to develop precise estimates of future site remediation costs. The Company's estimates are based on a number of factors, including the complexity of the geology, the nature and extent of contamination, the type of remedy, the outcome of discussions with regulatory agencies and other Potentially Responsible Parties ("PRPs") at multi-party sites and the number of and financial viability of other PRPs. Therefore, considerable uncertainty exists with respect to environmental remediation and costs, and under adverse changes in circumstances, it is reasonably possible that the ultimate cost with respect to these particular matters could range up to two and a half times above that amount. Consequently, it is reasonably possible that environmental remediation and restoration costs in excess of amounts accrued could have a material impact on the Company results of operations, financial condition and cash flows. It is the opinion of the Company management, however, that the possibility is remote that costs in excess of the range disclosed will have a material impact on the Company results of operations, financial condition or cash flows. For further discussion, see Environmental Matters in Management Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations and Notes 1 and 16 to the Consolidated Financial Statements. 66 Table of Contents Goodwill In the fourth quarter of 2017, the Company early adopted ASU 2017-04, "Intangibles - Goodwill and Other (Topic 350): Simplifying the Test for Goodwill Impairment," as part of the annual goodwill impairment testing. See Note 2 to the Consolidated Financial Statements for additional information. The Company performs goodwill impairment testing at the reporting unit level which is defined as the operating segment or one level below the operating segment. One level below the operating segment, or component, is a business in which discrete financial information is available and regularly reviewed by segment management. The Company aggregates certain components into reporting units based on economic similarities. The operating segment is the reporting unit for Agriculture, Electronics & Imaging, Nutrition & Health, and Transportation & Advanced Polymers operating segments. The Company tests goodwill for impairment annually (during the fourth quarter), or more frequently when events or changes in circumstances indicate it is more likely than not that the fair value of a reporting unit has declined below its carrying value. Goodwill is evaluated for impairment using qualitative and/or quantitative testing procedures. At December 31, 2017, the Company has defined 9 operating segments and 18 reporting units; goodwill is carried by 17 of these reporting units. The Company has the option to first perform qualitative testing to determine whether it is more likely than not that the fair value of a reporting unit is less than its carrying value. Qualitative factors assessed at the Company level include, but are not limited to, GDP growth rates, long-term hydrocarbon and energy prices, equity and credit market activity, discount rates, foreign exchange rates and overall financial performance. Qualitative factors assessed at the reporting unit level include, but are not limited to, changes in industry and market structure, competitive environments, planned capacity and new product launches, cost factors such as raw material prices, and financial performance of the reporting unit. If the Company chooses not to complete a qualitative assessment for a given reporting unit or if the initial assessment indicates that it is more likely than not that the estimated fair value of a reporting unit is less than its carrying value, additional quantitative testing is required. Quantitative testing requires the fair value of the reporting unit to be compared with its carrying value. If the reporting unit's carrying value exceeds its fair value, an impairment charge is recognized for the difference. The Company utilizes a discounted cash flow methodology to calculate the fair value of its reporting units. This valuation technique has been selected by management as the most meaningful valuation method due to the limited number of market comparables for the Company's reporting units. However, where market comparables are available, the Company includes EBIT/EBITDA multiples as part of the reporting unit valuation analysis. The discounted cash flow valuations are completed using the following key assumptions (including certain ranges used for the 2017 testing): projected revenue growth rates, or compounded annual growth rates, over a five to ten-year cash flow forecast period, which ranged from 0.1 percent to 6.4 percent and varied by reporting unit based on underlying business fundamentals and future expectations; discount rates, which ranged from 7.2 percent to 9.3 percent; tax rates; terminal values, differentiated based on the cash flow projection of each reporting unit and the projected net operating profit after tax ("NOPAT") growth rate, which ranged from 0.5 percent to 3.0 percent; currency exchange rates; and forecasted long-term hydrocarbon and energy prices, by geographic region and by year, which included the Company's key feedstocks as well as natural gas and crude oil (due to its correlation to naphtha). These key assumptions are determined through evaluation of the Company as a whole and underlying business fundamentals and industry risk. The Company also monitors and evaluates its market capitalization relative to book value. When the market capitalization of the Company falls below book value, management undertakes a process to evaluate whether a change in circumstances has occurred that would indicate it is more likely than not that the fair value of any of its reporting units has declined below carrying value. This evaluation process includes the use of third-party market-based valuations and internal discounted cash flow analysis. As part of the annual goodwill impairment test, the Company also compares market capitalization with the most recent total estimated fair value of its reporting units to ensure that significant differences are understood. At December 31, 2017, the Company's market capitalization exceeded book value. 2017 Goodwill Impairment Testing Effective with the Merger, the Company updated its reporting units to align with the level at which discrete financial information is available for review by management. In connection with the Merger, the Company recorded $45,105 million of goodwill, representing the preliminary fair value as of the effective date of the Merger. Goodwill resulting from the Merger was assigned to reporting units based on the acquisition method of accounting and is considered preliminary. For the remaining goodwill balance, a relative fair value method was used to reallocate goodwill for reporting units of which the composition had changed. No impairment indicators were identified as a result of the updated reporting unit alignment and reallocation of goodwill. In the f ourth quarter of 2017, quantitative testing was performed on twelve reporting units and a qualitative assessment was performed on the remaining reporting units that carry goodwill. 67 Table of Contents For the qualitative assessments, management considered the factors at both the Company level and the reporting unit level. Based on the qualitative assessment, management concluded it is not more likely than not that the fair value of the reporting unit is less than the carrying value of the reporting unit. Upon completion of quantitative testing in the fourth quarter of 2017, the Company determined the Coatings & Performance Monomers reporting unit was impaired. Throughout 2017, the Coatings & Performance Monomers reporting unit did not consistently meet expected financial performance targets, primarily due to increasing commoditization in coatings markets and competition, as well as customer consolidation in end markets which have reduced growth opportunities. As a result, the Coatings & Performance Monomers reporting unit lowered future revenue and profitability expectations. The fair value of the Coatings & Performance Monomers reporting unit was determined using a discounted cash flow methodology that reflected reductions in projected revenue growth rates, primarily driven by modified sales volume and pricing assumptions, as well as revised expectations for future growth rates. These discounted cash flows did not support the carrying value of the Coatings & Performance Monomers reporting unit. As a result, the Company recorded a goodwill impairment charge for the Coatings & Performance Monomers reporting unit of $1,491 million in the fourth quarter of 2017, included in Restructuring, goodwill impairment and asset related charges - net in the consolidated statements of income and related to the Performance Materials & Coatings segment. At December 31, 2017, the Coatings & Performance Monomers reporting unit carried $1,071 million of goodwill. The fair values of the remaining reporting units exceeded their carrying values and no other goodwill impairments were identified as a result of the 2017 testing. Pension and Other Postretirement Benefits The amounts recognized in the consolidated financial statements related to pension and other postretirement benefits are determined from actuarial valuations. Inherent in these valuations are assumptions including expected return on plan assets, discount rates at which the liabilities could have been settled, rate of increase in future compensation levels, mortality rates and health care cost trend rates. These assumptions are updated annually. In accordance with U.S. GAAP, actual results that differ from the assumptions are accumulated and amortized over future periods and, therefore, affect expense recognized and obligations recorded in future periods. The U.S. pension plans represent the majority of Dow and DuPont pension plan assets and pension obligations. Effective January 1, 2016, Dow adopted the spot rate approach to determine the discount rate utilized to measure the service cost and interest cost components of net periodic pension and other postretirement benefit costs for the U.S. and other selected countries. DuPont also adopted the spot rate approach for its U.S. plans. Under the spot rate approach, Dow and DuPont calculate service costs and interest costs by applying individual spot rates from a yield curve (based on high-quality corporate bond yields) for each selected country to the separate expected cash flow components of service cost and interest cost. Service cost and interest cost for all other plans are determined on the basis of the single equivalent discount rates derived in determining those plan obligations. Dow and DuPont changed to the new method to provide a more precise measure of interest and service costs for certain plans by improving the correlation between projected benefit cash flows and the discrete spot yield curves. The change in accounting estimate was applied prospectively starting in 2016. The following information relates to Dow and DuPont's U.S. plans only; a similar approach is used for Dow and DuPont's non-U.S. plans. Dow and DuPont determine the expected long-term rate of return on assets by performing a detailed analysis of historical and expected returns based on the strategic asset allocation and the underlying return fundamentals of each asset class. The historical experience of the pension fund asset performance is also considered. The expected return of each asset class is derived from a forecasted future return confirmed by historical experience. The expected long-term rate of return is an assumption and not what is expected to be earned in any one particular year. The weighted-average long-term rate of return assumption used for determining net periodic pension expense for 2017 was 7.46 percent. The assumption used for determining 2018 net periodic pension expense is 7.08 percent. Future actual pension expense will depend on future investment performance, changes in future discount rates and various other factors related to the population of participants in the Company pension plans. The discount rates utilized to measure the pension and other postretirement obligations of the U.S. plans are based on the yield on high-quality corporate fixed income investments at the measurement date. Future expected actuarially determined cash flows are individually discounted at spot rates under the Willis Towers Watson U.S. RATE:Link 60-90 corporate yield curve for Dow's plans and under the Aon Hewitt AA_Above Median yield curve for DuPont's plans to arrive at the plan's obligations as of the measurement date. The weighted average discount rate utilized to measure pension obligations decreased to 3.66 percent at December 31, 2017, from 4.11 percent at December 31, 2016. The assumption for the long-term rate of increase in compensation levels for the U.S. plans was 4.25 percent. Dow and DuPont use generational mortality tables to value their U.S. pension and other postretirement obligations. 68 Table of Contents The following discussion relates to Dow's significant pension plans and DuPont's U.S. qualified plan. Dow and DuPont base the determination of pension expense on a market-related valuation of plan assets that reduces year-to-year volatility. For Dow, this market-related valuation recognizes investment gains or losses over a five-year period from the year in which they occur. For DuPont, the market-related value of assets is calculated by averaging market returns over 36 months. As a result, changes in the fair value of assets are not immediately reflected in the Company calculation of net periodic pension cost. Over the life of the plans, both gains and losses have been recognized and amortized. At December 31, 2017, net gains of $393 million remain to be recognized in the calculation of the market-related value of plan assets. These net gains will result in decreases in future pension expense as they are recognized in the market-related value of assets. The net increase in the market-related value of assets due to the recognition of prior gains (losses) is presented in the following table: Net Increase in Market-Related Asset Value Due to Recognition of Prior Gains (Losses) In millions 2018 $ 92 2019 (30 ) 2020 155 2021 176 Total $ 393 The Company expects pension expense to decrease in 2018 by approximately $900 million. Excluding Dow's settlement charge resulting from a change in control provision which occurred at the time of the Merger, pension expense is expected to decrease approximately $210 million in 2018, primarily due to the expected full year net credit for DuPont plans. As a result of the elimination of the net losses and prior service benefits recognized in DuPont accumulated other comprehensive loss in connection with purchase accounting, instead of benefit cost, a net credit for DuPont plans was recognized in 2017 post-Merger and is anticipated for the full year of 2018. A 25 basis point increase or decrease in the long-term return on assets assumption would change the Company total pension expense for 2018 by $106 million. A 25 basis point increase in the discount rate assumption would lower the Company's total pension expense for 2018 by $34 million. A 25 basis point decrease in the discount rate assumption would increase the Company's total pension expense for 2018 by $33 million. A 25 basis point change in the long-term return and discount rate assumptions would have an immaterial impact on the other postretirement benefit expense for 2018. Income Taxes Deferred tax assets and liabilities are determined based on temporary differences between the financial reporting and tax bases of assets and liabilities, applying enacted tax rates expected to be in effect for the year in which the differences are expected to reverse. Based on the evaluation of available evidence, both positive and negative, the Company recognizes future tax benefits, such as net operating loss carryforwards and tax credit carryforwards, to the extent that realizing these benefits is considered to be more likely than not. At December 31, 2017, the Company had a net deferred tax liability balance of $4,397 million , after valuation allowances of $2,749 million . In evaluating the ability to realize the deferred tax assets, the Company relies on, in order of increasing subjectivity, taxable income in prior carryback years, the future reversals of existing taxable temporary differences, tax planning strategies and forecasted taxable income using historical and projected future operating results. At December 31, 2017, the Company had deferred tax assets for tax loss and tax credit carryforwards of $3,425 million , $337 million of which is subject to expiration in the years 2018 through 2022. The Company recognizes the financial statement effects of an uncertain income tax position when it is more likely than not, based on technical merits, that the position will be sustained upon examination. At December 31, 2017, the Company had uncertain tax positions for both domestic and foreign issues of $712 million . On December 22, 2017, the Tax Cuts and Jobs Act ( The Act ) was enacted, making significant changes to the U.S. tax law. The SEC staff issued Staff Accounting Bulletin No. 118 ( SAB 118 ), which provides guidance on accounting for the tax effects of The Act for which the accounting under ASC 740, "Income Taxes" ( ASC 740 ) is incomplete. To the extent that a company's 69 Table of Contents accounting for certain income tax effects of The Act is incomplete but it is able to determine a reasonable estimate, it must record a provisional estimate in the financial statements. The provisional amounts, and adjustments identified in the measurement period, are recorded to the provision for income taxes on continuing operations in the period the amounts are determined. In accordance with SAB 118, income tax effects of The Act may be refined upon obtaining, preparing, or analyzing additional information during the measurement period and such changes could be material. SAB 118 provides that the measurement period is complete when a company's accounting is complete and in no circumstances should the measurement period extend beyond one year from the enactment date. If a company cannot determine a provisional estimate to be included in the financial statements, it should continue to apply ASC 740 on the basis of the provisions of the tax laws that were in effect immediately before enactment of The Act. For additional information, see Notes 1 and 8 to the Consolidated Financial Statements. Indemnification Assets On July 1, 2015, DuPont completed the separation of its Performance Chemicals segment through the spin-off of all of the issued and outstanding stock of The Chemours Company (the "Separation"). In connection with the Separation, DuPont and The Chemours Company ("Chemours") entered into a Separation Agreement (the "Separation Agreement"). Pursuant to the Separation Agreement, as amended and discussed in Note 16 to the Consolidated Financial Statements, DuPont is indemnified by Chemours against certain litigation, environmental, workers' compensation and other liabilities that arose prior to the Separation. The term of this indemnification is indefinite and includes defense costs and expenses, as well as monetary and non-monetary settlements and judgments. In connection with the recognition of liabilities related to these indemnified matters, DuPont records an indemnification asset when recovery is deemed probable. In assessing the probability of recovery, DuPont considers the contractual rights under the Separation Agreement and any potential credit risk. Future events, such as potential disputes related to recovery as well as the solvency of Chemours, could cause the indemnification assets to have a lower value than anticipated and recorded. The Company evaluates the recovery of the indemnification assets recorded when events or changes in circumstances indicate the carrying values may not be fully recoverable. Purchase Accounting Due to the Merger and the related accounting determination, DuPont assets and liabilities were measured at fair value as of the date of the Merger. Estimates of fair value require a complex series of judgments about future events and uncertainties. In determining the fair value, DowDuPont utilized various forms of the income, cost and market approaches depending on the asset or liability being fair valued. The estimation of fair value required significant judgments related to future net cash flows (including net sales, cost of products sold, selling and marketing costs, and working capital/contributory asset charges), discount rates reflecting the risk inherent in each cash flow stream, competitive trends, market comparables and other factors. Inputs were generally determined by taking into account historical data, supplemented by current and anticipated market conditions, and growth rates.The estimates and assumptions used to determine the preliminary estimated fair value assigned to each class of assets and liabilities, as well as asset lives, have a material impact to the Company's Consolidated Financial Statements, and are based upon assumptions believed to be reasonable but that are inherently uncertain. Third party valuation specialists were engaged to assist in the valuation of certain of these assets and liabilities. Environmental Matters Environmental Policies - Dow To meet Dow public commitments, as well as the stringent laws and government regulations related to environmental protection and remediation to which its global operations are subject, Dow has well-defined policies, requirements and management systems. Dow EH&S Management System ( EMS ) defines the who, what, when and how needed for the businesses to achieve Dow policies, requirements, performance objectives, leadership expectations and public commitments. To ensure effective utilization, the EMS is integrated into a company-wide management system for EH&S, Operations, Quality and Human Resources. It is Dow policy to adhere to a waste management hierarchy that minimizes the impact of wastes and emissions on the environment. First, Dow works to eliminate or minimize the generation of waste and emissions at the source through research, process design, plant operations and maintenance. Second, Dow finds ways to reuse and recycle materials. Finally, unusable or non-recyclable hazardous waste is treated before disposal to eliminate or reduce the hazardous nature and volume of the waste. Treatment may include destruction by chemical, physical, biological or thermal means. Disposal of waste materials in landfills is considered only after all other options have been thoroughly evaluated. Dow has specific requirements for waste that is transferred to non-Dow facilities, including the periodic auditing of these facilities. Dow believes third-party verification and transparent public reporting are cornerstones of world-class EH&S performance and building public trust. Numerous Dow sites in Europe, Latin America, Asia Pacific and the U.S. & Canada have received third party verification of Dow compliance with RESPONSIBLE CARE and with outside specifications such as ISO-14001. Dow continues to be a global champion of RESPONSIBLE CARE and has worked to broaden the application and impact of RESPONSIBLE CARE around the world through engagement with suppliers, customers and joint venture partners. 70 Table of Contents Dow EH&S policies helped achieve improvements in many aspects of EH&S performance in 2017. Dow process safety performance was excellent in 2017 and improvements were made in injury/illness rates. Safety remains a priority for Dow. Further improvement in these areas, as well as environmental compliance, remains a top management priority, with initiatives underway to further improve performance and compliance in 2018 as Dow continues to implement its 2025 Sustainability Goals. Detailed information on Dow performance regarding environmental matters and goals can be found online on Dow Science & Sustainability webpage at www.dow.com. Dow's website and its content are not deemed incorporated by reference into this report. Environmental Policies - DuPont DuPont operates global manufacturing, product handling and distribution facilities that are subject to a broad array of environmental laws and regulations. Such rules are subject to change by the implementing governmental agency, and DuPont monitors these changes closely. DuPont's policy requires that all operations fully meet or exceed legal and regulatory requirements. In addition, DuPont implements voluntary programs to reduce air emissions, minimize the generation of hazardous waste, decrease the volume of water use and discharges, increase the efficiency of energy use and reduce the generation of persistent, bioaccumulative and toxic materials. Management has noted a global upward trend in the amount and complexity of proposed chemicals regulation. The costs to comply with complex environmental laws and regulations, as well as internal voluntary programs and goals, are significant and will continue to be significant for the foreseeable future. Climate Change - Dow Climate change matters for Dow are likely to be driven by changes in regulations, public policy and physical climate parameters. Regulatory Matters Regulatory matters include cap and trade schemes; increased greenhouse gas ( GHG ) limits; and taxes on GHG emissions, fuel and energy. The potential implications of each of these matters are all very similar, including increased costs of purchased energy, additional capital costs for installation or modification of GHG emitting equipment, and additional costs associated directly with GHG emissions (such as cap and trade systems or carbon taxes), which are primarily related to energy use. It is difficult to estimate the potential impact of these regulatory matters on energy prices. Reducing Dow's overall energy usage and GHG emissions through new and unfolding projects will decrease the potential impact of these regulatory matters. Dow also has a dedicated commercial group to handle energy contracts and purchases, including managing emissions trading. Dow has not experienced any material impact related to regulated GHG emissions and continues to evaluate and monitor this area for future developments. Physical Climate Parameters Many scientific academies throughout the world have concluded that it is very likely that human activities are contributing to global warming. At this point, it is difficult to predict and assess the probability and opportunity of a global warming trend on Dow specifically. Preparedness plans are developed that detail actions needed in the event of severe weather. These measures have historically been in place and these activities and associated costs are driven by normal operational preparedness. Dow continues to study the long-term implications of changing climate parameters on water availability, plant siting issues, and impacts and opportunities for products. Dow Energy business and Public Affairs and Sustainability functions are tasked with developing and implementing a comprehensive strategy that addresses the potential challenges of energy security and GHG emissions. Dow continues to elevate its internal focus and external positions - to focus on the root causes of GHG emissions - including the unsustainable use of energy. Dow's energy plan provides the roadmap: Conserve - aggressively pursue energy efficiency and conservation Optimize - increase and diversify energy resources Accelerate - develop cost-effective, clean, renewable and alternative energy sources Transition - to a sustainable energy future Through corporate energy efficiency programs and focused GHG management efforts, Dow has and is continuing to reduce its GHG emissions footprint. Dow manufacturing intensity, measured in Btu per pound of product, has improved by more than 40 percent since 1990. As part of its 2025 Sustainability Goals, Dow will maintain GHG emissions below 2006 levels on an absolute basis for all GHGs. Dow intends to implement the recommendations of the Financial Stability Board's Task Force on Climate-Related Disclosures ("Task Force") over the next three to five years, which is aligned with the recommendations of the Task Force. 71 Table of Contents Climate Change - DuPont DuPont believes that climate change is an important global issue that presents risks and opportunities. Expanding upon significant global GHG emissions and other environmental footprint reductions made in the period 1990-2010, in 2015, DuPont announced its 2020 Sustainability Goals, including a goal to achieve a 7 percent reduction in GHG emissions intensity (2015 baseline) and a 10 percent improvement in energy intensity (2010 baseline). As of 2016, DuPont achieved reductions of 1.3 percent in GHG emissions intensity against the goal baseline of 2015, and 8 percent since 2010. In addition, DuPont has achieved a 10.8 percent improvement in energy intensity since 2010. DuPont continuously evaluates opportunities for existing and new product and service offerings in light of the anticipated demands of a low-carbon economy. DuPont is actively engaged in efforts to develop constructive public policies to reduce GHG emissions and encourage lower carbon forms of energy. Such policies may bring higher operating costs as well as greater revenue and margin opportunities. Legislative efforts to control or limit GHG emissions could affect DuPont's energy source and supply choices as well as increase the cost of energy and raw materials derived from fossil fuels. Such efforts are also anticipated to provide the business community with greater certainty for the regulatory future, help guide investment decisions and drive growth in demand for low-carbon and energy-efficient products, technologies and services. Similarly, demand is expected to grow for products that facilitate adaptation to a changing climate. However, the current unsettled policy environment in the U.S., where many DuPont facilities are located, adds an element of uncertainty to business decisions, particularly those relating to long-term capital investments. In addition, significant differences in regional or national approaches could present challenges in a global marketplace. An effective global climate policy framework will help drive the market changes that are needed to stimulate and efficiently deploy new innovations in science and technology, while maintaining open and competitive global markets. DowDuPont Environmental Remediation Environmental Capital Expenditures Capital expenditures for environmental projects, either required by law or necessary to meet the Company internal environmental goals, were $97 million in 2017. Environmental Operating Costs and Remediation As a result of the Dow and DuPont operations, DowDuPont incurs environmental operating costs for pollution abatement activities including waste collection and disposal, installation and maintenance of air pollution controls and wastewater treatment, emissions testing and monitoring and obtaining permits. The Company also incurs environmental operating costs related to environmental related research and development activities including environmental field and treatment studies as well as toxicity and degradation testing to evaluate the environmental impact of products and raw materials. Pretax environmental expenses charged to income from continuing operations are summarized below: Environmental Expenses Charged to Income In millions 2017 1 2016 2015 Environmental operating costs $ 725 $ 623 $ 613 Environmental remediation costs 179 504 218 Total $ 904 $ 1,127 $ 831 1. Includes DuPont costs for the period September 1, 2017 through December 31, 2017. Based on existing facts and circumstances, management does not believe that year over year changes in environmental expenses charged to current operations will have a material impact on the Company's financial position, liquidity or results of operations. Annual expenditures in the near term are not expected to vary significantly from the range of such expenditures experienced in the past few years. Longer term, expenditures are subject to considerable uncertainty and may fluctuate significantly. 72 Table of Contents Changes in the remediation accrual balance are summarized below: Accrued Obligations for Environmental Matters In millions 2017 2016 Balance at Jan 1 $ 909 $ 670 Liabilities assumed 1 483 Accrual adjustment 180 479 Payments against reserve (260 ) (246 ) Foreign currency impact 17 6 Net change, indemnification 2 (18 ) Balance at Dec 31 $ 1,311 $ 909 1. Remediation obligations assumed upon completion of the Merger. 2. Net change in indemnified remediation obligations. Pursuant to the Separation Agreement, as discussed below and in Note 16 to the Consolidated Financial Statements, DuPont is indemnified by Chemours for certain environmental matters. Considerable uncertainty exists with respect to environmental remediation and costs, and under adverse changes in circumstances, it is reasonably possible that the ultimate cost with respect to these particular matters could range up to two and a half times above the amount accrued. Consequently, it is reasonably possible that environmental remediation and restoration costs in excess of amounts accrued could have a material impact on the Company results of operations, financial condition and cash flows. It is the opinion of the Company management, however, that the possibility is remote that costs in excess of the range disclosed will have a material impact on the Company results of operations, financial condition or cash flows. For further discussion, see Environmental Matters in Management Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations and Notes 1 and 16 to the Consolidated Financial Statements. Information regarding environmental sites is provided below: Environmental Sites 1 DuPont Dow Sites 2 Superfund Sites 3, 4 Sites 5 Superfund Sites 3 2017 2017 2017 2016 2017 2016 Number of sites at Jan 1 189 180 131 124 Sites added during year 6 99 62 60 16 2 10 Sites closed during year (5 ) (7 ) (2 ) (3 ) Number of sites at Dec 31 99 62 244 189 131 131 1. Active sites. 2. Sites currently or formerly owned by DuPont. Remediation obligations are imposed by the Resource Conservation and Recovery Act or similar state law in the United States and by similar federal, state, provincial or local law in non-U.S. locations. At December 31, 2017, Chemours is indemnifying DuPont for activities at 36 of these sites. See discussion below and Note 16 to the Consolidated Financial Statements for additional information. 3. Superfund sites are sites, including sites not owned by DuPont or Dow, where remediation obligations may be imposed on either company under federal or state Superfund laws or similar laws in non-U.S. locations. The total includes approximately 40 sites that have been counted twice as DuPont and Dow are separately named. 4. At December 31, 2017, Chemours is indemnifying DuPont for activities at 28 of these Superfund sites. See discussion below and Note 16 to the Consolidated Financial Statements for additional information. 5. Sites currently or formerly owned by Dow. Remediation obligations are imposed by the Resource Conservation and Recovery Act or similar state law in the United States and by similar federal, state, provincial or local law in non-U.S. locations. At December 31, 2017, 35 of these sites (38 sites at December 31, 2016) were formerly owned by Dowell Schlumberger, Inc., a group of companies in which Dow previously owned a 50 percent interest. Dow sold its interest in Dowell Schlumberger in 1992. 6. Includes DuPont remediation obligations transferred as a result of the Merger. Additional information is provided below for Dow Midland, Michigan, manufacturing site and Midland off-site locations (collectively, the "Midland sites"), as well as a Superfund site in Wood-Ridge, New Jersey, the locations for Dow that have the largest potential environmental liabilities. In the early days of operations at the Dow Midland manufacturing site, wastes were usually disposed of on-site, resulting in soil and groundwater contamination, which has been contained and managed on-site under a series of Resource Conservation and Recovery Act permits and regulatory agreements. The Hazardous Waste Operating License for the Midland manufacturing site, issued in 2003, and renewed and replaced in September 2015, also included provisions for Dow to conduct an investigation to determine the nature and extent of off-site contamination from historic Midland manufacturing site operations. In January 2010, Dow, the EPA and the State of Michigan ("State") entered into an Administrative Order on Consent that requires Dow to conduct 73 Table of Contents a remedial investigation, a feasibility study and a remedial design for the Tittabawassee River, the Saginaw River and the Saginaw Bay, and pay the oversight costs of the EPA and the State under the authority of the federal Comprehensive Environmental Response, Compensation and Liability Act. See Note 16 to the Consolidated Financial Statements for additional information. At December 31, 2017, Dow had an accrual of $131 million ( $137 million at December 31, 2016) for environmental remediation and investigation associated with the Midland sites. In 2017, Dow spent $24 million ( $36 million in 2016) for environmental remediation at the Midland sites. Rohm and Haas, a wholly owned subsidiary of Dow, is a PRP at the Wood-Ridge, New Jersey Ventron/Velsicol Superfund Site, and the adjacent Berry Creek Study Area ("BCSA") (collectively, the "Wood-Ridge sites"). Rohm and Haas is a successor in interest to a company that owned and operated a mercury processing facility, where wastewater and waste handling resulted in contamination of soils and adjacent creek sediments. The Berry Creek Study Area PRP group completed a multi-stage Remedial Investigation ("RI") pursuant to an Administrative Order on Consent with U.S. EPA Region 2 to identify contamination in surface water, sediment and biota related to numerous contaminated sites in the Berry's Creek watershed, and submitted the report to the EPA in June 2016. That same month, the EPA concluded that an "iterative or adaptive approach" was appropriate for cleaning up the BCSA. Thus, each phase of remediation will be followed by a period of monitoring to assess its effectiveness and determine if there is a need for more work. The Feasibility Study ("FS") for the first phase of work will be submitted in the second half of 2018. The EPA will then review the remedial options presented in the FS, select the remedy and issue an interim Record of Decision ("ROD"). The PRP group will then attempt to negotiate agreements among the PRP's to fund the selected remedy and with the EPA to perform the remediation. Although there is currently much uncertainty as to what will ultimately be required to remediate the BCSA and Rohm and Haas's share of these costs has yet to be determined, the range of activities that will be required in the interim ROD is known in general terms. Based on the first phase of the RI and agreement with the EPA, the overall remediation accrual for the Wood-Ridge sites was increased by $80 million in the fourth quarter of 2016. At December 31, 2017, the Company had an accrual of $88 million ( $91 million at December 31, 2016) for environmental remediation at the Wood-Ridge sites. In 2017, Dow spent $7 million ( $6 million in 2016) on environmental remediation at the Wood-Ridge sites. In the fourth quarter of 2016, Dow recorded a pretax charge of $295 million for environmental remediation at a number of historical locations, including the Midland manufacturing site/off-site matters and the Wood-Ridge sites, primarily resulting from the culmination of negotiations with regulators and/or final agency approval. This charge was included in "Cost of sales" in the consolidated statements of income. In total, the Company accrued liability for probable environmental remediation and restoration costs was $1,311 million at December 31, 2017, compared with $909 million at December 31, 2016. This is management best estimate of the costs for remediation and restoration with respect to environmental matters for which the Company has accrued liabilities, although it is reasonably possible that the ultimate cost with respect to these particular matters could range up to approximately two and a half times that amount. Consequently, it is reasonably possible that environmental remediation and restoration costs in excess of amounts accrued could have a material impact on the Company results of operations, financial condition and cash flows. It is the opinion of the Company management, however, that the possibility is remote that costs in excess of the range disclosed will have a material impact on the Company results of operations, financial condition and cash flows. Separation of DuPont's Performance Chemicals Segment Pursuant to the Separation Agreement discussed in Note 16 to the Consolidated Financial Statements, DuPont is indemnified by Chemours for certain environmental matters, included in the liability of $1,311 million , that had an estimated liability of $242 million at December 31, 2017, and a potential exposure that ranges up to approximately $430 million above the current accrual. As such, DuPont has recorded an indemnification asset of $242 million corresponding to DuPont's accrual balance related to these matters at December 31, 2017. Asbestos-Related Matters of Union Carbide Corporation Union Carbide is and has been involved in a large number of asbestos-related suits filed primarily in state courts during the past four decades. These suits principally allege personal injury resulting from exposure to asbestos-containing products and frequently seek both actual and punitive damages. The alleged claims primarily relate to products that Union Carbide sold in the past, alleged exposure to asbestos-containing products located on Union Carbide premises, and Union Carbide responsibility for asbestos suits filed against a former Union Carbide subsidiary, Amchem. In many cases, plaintiffs are unable to demonstrate that they have suffered any compensable loss as a result of such exposure, or that injuries incurred in fact resulted from exposure to Union Carbide products. 74 Table of Contents The table below provides information regarding asbestos-related claims pending against Union Carbide and Amchem based on criteria developed by Union Carbide and its external consultants. Union Carbide had a significant increase in the number of claims settled, dismissed or otherwise resolved in 2015 resulting from a detailed review of the status of individual claims and an update to criteria used to classify claims. Asbestos-Related Claim Activity 2017 2016 2015 Claims unresolved at Jan 1 16,141 18,778 26,116 Claims filed 7,010 7,813 7,544 Claims settled, dismissed or otherwise resolved (7,724 ) (10,450 ) (14,882 ) Claims unresolved at Dec 31 15,427 16,141 18,778 Claimants with claims against both Union Carbide and Amchem (5,530 ) (5,741 ) (6,804 ) Individual claimants at Dec 31 9,897 10,400 11,974 Plaintiffs lawyers often sue numerous defendants in individual lawsuits or on behalf of numerous claimants. As a result, the damages alleged are not expressly identified as to Union Carbide, Amchem or any other particular defendant, even when specific damages are alleged with respect to a specific disease or injury. In fact, there are no personal injury cases in which only Union Carbide and/or Amchem are the sole named defendants. For these reasons and based upon Union Carbide litigation and settlement experience, Union Carbide does not consider the damages alleged against Union Carbide and Amchem to be a meaningful factor in its determination of any potential asbestos-related liability. For additional information, see Part I, Item 3. Legal Proceedings and Asbestos-Related Matters of Union Carbide Corporation and Note 16 to the Consolidated Financial Statements.
