Item 7. MANAGEMENT S DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS OF FINANCIAL CONDITION AND RESULTS OF OPERATIONS EXECUTIVE OVERVIEW The year ended December 31, 2007 was very difficult. We experienced sharp increases in the cost of commodities, particularly costs for dairy products. These cost increases totaled approximately $100 million and reduced gross margin by approximately 240 basis points. We also experienced increased competitive activity and changing consumer trends toward premium and trade-up product segments that affected our growth and profitability. In the face of these challenges, we did not have adequate product innovation and sufficient brand support or retail execution in our core U.S. market. Additionally, we continued to invest in key international markets. Net sales were even with the prior year as increased sales from our international businesses and incremental sales from the acquisition of the Godrej Hershey Foods and Beverages Company were substantially offset by lower sales in the United States. Net sales declined in the United States primarily as a result of increased competitive activity and reduced retail velocity. Income and earnings per share were significantly lower than 2006 primarily as a result of a lower gross margin reflecting substantially higher input costs, principally related to higher costs for dairy products and certain other raw materials, and reduced price realization resulting from increased promotional costs, partly offset by lower costs associated with our supply chain productivity improvements. Increased investment spending for advertising and expansion of our international infrastructure also contributed to the lower income in 2007. Non-GAAP Financial Measures Items Affecting Comparability Our Management Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations section includes certain measures of financial performance that are not defined by U.S. generally accepted accounting principles ( GAAP ). For each of these non-GAAP financial measures, we are providing below (1) the most directly comparable GAAP measure; (2) a reconciliation of the differences between the non-GAAP measure and the most directly comparable GAAP measure; (3) an explanation of why our management believes these non-GAAP measures provide useful information to investors; and (4) additional purposes for which we use these non-GAAP measures. We believe that the disclosure of these non-GAAP measures provides investors with a better comparison of our year-to-year operating results. We exclude the effects of certain items from Income before Interest and Income Taxes ( EBIT ), Net Income and Income per Share-Diluted-Common Stock ( EPS ) when we evaluate key measures of our performance internally, and in assessing the impact of known trends and uncertainties on our business. We also believe that excluding the effects of these items provides a more balanced view of the underlying dynamics of our business. Items affecting comparability include the impacts of charges or credits in 2007, 2006, 2005, 2003 and 2002 associated with our business realignment initiatives and a reduction of the income tax provision in 2004 resulting from adjustments to income tax contingency reserves. 19 Table of Contents For the years ended December 31, 2007 2006 EBIT Net Income EPS EBIT Net Income EPS In millions of dollars except per share amounts Results in accordance with GAAP $ 458.8 $ 214.2 $ .93 $ 992.6 $ 559.1 $ 2.34 Items affecting comparability: Business realignment charges included in cost of sales 123.1 80.9 .35 (3.2 ) (2.0 ) (.01 ) Business realignment charges included in selling, marketing and administrative ( SM&A ) 12.6 7.8 .03 .3 .2 Business realignment and impairment charges, net 276.9 178.9 .77 14.5 9.3 .04 Non-GAAP results excluding items affecting comparability $ 871.4 $ 481.8 $ 2.08 $ 1,004.2 $ 566.6 $ 2.37 For the years ended December 31, 2005 2004 EBIT Net Income EPS EBIT Net Income EPS In millions of dollars except per share amounts Results in accordance with GAAP $ 853.6 $ 488.5 $ 1.97 $ 876.6 $ 574.6 $ 2.24 Items affecting comparability: Business realignment charges included in cost of sales 22.5 13.4 .05 Business realignment and impairment charges, net 96.5 60.7 .25 Tax provision adjustment (61.1 ) (.24 ) Non-GAAP results excluding items affecting comparability $ 972.6 $ 562.6 $ 2.27 $ 876.6 $ 513.5 $ 2.00 For the years ended December 31, 2003 2002 EBIT Net Income EPS EBIT Net Income EPS In millions of dollars except per share amounts Results in accordance with GAAP $ 767.4 $ 439.2 $ 1.66 $ 683.0 $ 393.9 $ 1.43 Items affecting comparability: Business realignment charges included in cost of sales 2.1 1.3 6.4 4.1 .01 Costs to explore the sale of the Company included in SM&A 17.2 10.9 .04 Business realignment and impairment charges, net 23.4 14.2 .05 27.6 17.4 .06 Gain on sale of business (8.3 ) (5.7 ) (.02 ) Cumulative effect of accounting change 7.4 .03 Non-GAAP results excluding items affecting comparability $ 784.6 $ 456.4 $ 1.72 $ 734.2 $ 426.3 $ 1.54 Actual Results Excluding Items Affecting Comparability Key Annual Performance Measures 2007 2006 2005 Increase in Net Sales 0.1% 2.6% 9.1% (Decrease) increase in EBIT (13.2)% 3.2% 11.0% (Decline) improvement in EBIT Margin in basis points ( bps ) (270)bps 10 bps 40 bps (Decrease) increase in EPS (12.2)% 4.4% 13.5% 20 Table of Contents SUMMARY OF OPERATING RESULTS Analysis of Selected Items from Our Income Statement Percent Change Increase (Decrease) For the years ended December 31, 2007 2006 2005 2007-2006 2006-2005 In millions of dollars except per share amounts Net Sales $ 4,946.7 $ 4,944.2 $ 4,819.8 0.1 % 2.6 % Cost of Sales 3,315.1 3,076.7 2,956.7 7.7 4.1 Gross Profit 1,631.6 1,867.5 1,863.1 (12.6 ) 0.2 Gross Margin 33.0 % 37.8 % 38.7 % SM&A Expense 895.9 860.3 913.0 4.1 (5.8 ) SM&A Expense as a percent of sales 18.1 % 17.4 % 18.9 % Business Realignment and Impairment Charges, net 276.9 14.6 96.5 N/A (84.9 ) EBIT 458.8 992.6 853.6 (53.8 ) 16.3 EBIT Margin 9.3 % 20.1 % 17.7 % Interest Expense, Net 118.6 116.1 88.0 2.2 31.9 Provision for Income Taxes 126.0 317.4 277.1 (60.3 ) 14.6 Effective Income Tax Rate 37.1 % 36.2 % 36.2 % Net Income $ 214.2 $ 559.1 $ 488.5 (61.7 ) 14.4 Net Income Per Share Diluted $ .93 $ 2.34 $ 1.97 (60.3 ) 18.8 Net Sales 2007 compared with 2006 Net sales for 2007 were essentially even with 2006. Sales increased for our international businesses, primarily exports to Asia and Latin America, as well as sales in Canada and Mexico. The acquisition of Godrej Hershey Foods and Beverages Company increased net sales by $46.5 million, or 0.9%, in 2007. Favorable foreign currency exchange rates also had a positive impact on sales. These increases were substantially offset by lower sales volume for existing products in the U.S., reflecting increased competitive activity and reduced retail velocity. Decreased price realization from higher rates of promotional spending and higher allowances for slow-moving products at retail more than offset increases in list prices contributing to the sales decline in the U.S. 2006 compared with 2005 U.S. confectionery sales volume increases contributed over three quarters of the total increase in net sales. Sales of new products and higher seasonal sales contributed the majority of the volume increase. Sales in 2006 also benefited from improved price realization resulting from higher list prices in the United States implemented in 2005, substantially offset by a higher rate of promotional allowances. Favorable foreign currency exchange rates and higher sales volume in Mexico also contributed to the sales increase. These increases were offset somewhat by lower sales in Canada, partly due to the impact of a product recall during the fourth quarter caused by a contaminated ingredient purchased from an outside supplier. Key Marketplace Metrics For the 52 weeks ended December 31, 2007 2006 2005 Consumer Takeaway Increase 1.3 % 4.0 % 4.2 % Market Share (Decrease) Increase (1.3 ) (0.2 ) 0.7 21 Table of Contents Consumer takeaway is provided for channels of distribution accounting for approximately 80% of our U.S. confectionery retail business. These channels of distribution include food, drug, mass merchandisers, including Wal-Mart Stores, Inc., and convenience stores. The change in market share is provided for channels measured by syndicated data which include sales in the food, drug, convenience store and mass merchandiser classes of trade, excluding sales of Wal-Mart Stores, Inc. Cost of Sales and Gross Margin 2007 compared with 2006 Business realignment charges of $123.1 million were included in cost of sales in 2007, compared with a credit of $3.2 million included in cost of sales in 2006. The remainder of the cost of sales increase was primarily associated with significantly higher input costs, particularly for dairy products and certain other raw materials, and the Godrej Hershey Foods and Beverages business acquired in May 2007, offset somewhat by favorable supply chain productivity. The gross margin decline was primarily attributable to the impact of business realignment initiatives recorded in 2007 compared with 2006, resulting in a reduction of 2.6 percentage points. The rest of the decline reflected substantially higher costs for raw materials, offset somewhat by improved supply chain productivity. Also contributing to the decrease was lower net price realization due to higher promotional costs. 2006 compared with 2005 The sales volume increase, higher energy, raw material and other input costs were the primary contributors to the cost of sales increase for 2006. Higher costs associated with obsolete, aged and unsaleable products also contributed to the increase. These increases were offset somewhat by reductions in U.S. manufacturing costs and a decrease in cost of sales of $3.2 million in 2006 resulting from the adjustment of liabilities associated with business realignment initiatives. Business realignment charges of $22.5 million were included in cost of sales in 2005 reflecting accelerated depreciation resulting from the closure of a manufacturing facility located in Las Piedras, Puerto Rico. Gross margin in 2006 was negatively impacted by higher costs for energy and raw materials, increased costs related to product obsolescence and an unfavorable sales mix. These were partially offset by improved price realization and supply chain productivity. Our business realignment initiatives improved gross margin 0.1 percentage point in 2006 and reduced gross margin by 0.4 percentage points in 2005. Selling, Marketing and Administrative 2007 compared with 2006 Selling, marketing and administrative expenses increased primarily as a result of higher administrative and advertising expenses, partially offset by lower consumer promotional expenses. Project implementation costs related to our 2007 business realignment initiatives contributed $12.6 million to the increase. Higher administrative costs were principally associated with employee-related expenses from the expansion of our international businesses, including the impact of the acquisition of Godrej Hershey Foods and Beverages Company. 2006 compared with 2005 Selling, marketing and administrative expenses decreased primarily due to reduced administrative costs reflecting lower incentive compensation expense and savings resulting from our 2005 business realignment initiatives. Reduced advertising expense in 2006 was substantially offset by higher consumer promotion expenses. 22 Table of Contents Business Realignment Initiatives In February 2007, we announced a comprehensive, three-year supply chain transformation program (the global supply chain transformation program ) and, in December 2007, we recorded impairment and business realignment charges associated with our business in Brazil (together, the 2007 business realignment initiatives ). When completed, the global supply chain transformation program will greatly enhance our manufacturing, sourcing and customer service capabilities, reduce inventories resulting in improvements in working capital and generate significant resources to invest in our growth initiatives. These initiatives include accelerated marketplace momentum within our core U.S. business, creation of innovative new product platforms to meet customer needs and disciplined global expansion. Under the program, which will be implemented in stages over three years, we will significantly increase manufacturing capacity utilization by reducing the number of production lines by more than one-third, outsource production of low value-added items and construct a flexible, cost-effective production facility in Monterrey, Mexico to meet current and emerging marketplace needs. The program will result in a total net reduction of 1,500 positions across our supply chain over the three-year implementation period. The estimated pre-tax cost of the global supply chain transformation program is from $525 million to $575 million over three years. The total includes from $475 million to $525 million in business realignment costs and approximately $50 million in project implementation costs. The costs will be incurred primarily in 2007 and 2008. Total costs of $400.0 million were recorded in 2007 for this program. In 2001, we acquired a small business in Brazil, Hershey do Brasil, which has not gained profitable scale or adequate market distribution. In an effort to improve the performance of this business, in January 2008 Hershey do Brasil entered into a cooperative agreement with Pandurata Alimentos LTDA ( Bauducco ), a leading manufacturer of baked goods in Brazil whose primary brand is Bauducco. The arrangement with Bauducco will leverage Bauducco strong sales and distribution capabilities for our products throughout Brazil. Under this agreement we will manufacture and market, and they will sell and distribute our products. We will maintain a 51% controlling interest in Hershey do Brasil. In the fourth quarter of 2007, we recorded a goodwill impairment charge and approved a business realignment program associated with initiatives to improve distribution and enhance the financial performance of our business in Brazil. In July 2005, we announced initiatives intended to advance our value-enhancing strategy (the 2005 business realignment initiatives ). Charges (credits) for the 2005 business realignment initiatives were recorded during 2005 and 2006 and the 2005 business realignment initiatives were completed by December 31, 2006. 23 Table of Contents Charges (credits) associated with business realignment initiatives recorded during 2007, 2006 and 2005 were as follows: For the years ended December 31, 2007 2006 2005 In thousands of dollars Cost of sales 2007 business realignment initiatives: Global supply chain transformation program $ 123,090 $ $ 2005 business realignment initiatives (1,599 ) 22,459 Previous business realignment initiatives (1,600 ) Total cost of sales 123,090 (3,199 ) 22,459 Selling, marketing and administrative 2007 business realignment initiatives: Global supply chain transformation program 12,623 2005 business realignment initiatives 266 Total selling, marketing and administrative 12,623 266 Business realignment and impairment charges, net 2007 business realignment initiatives: Global supply chain transformation program: Fixed asset impairments and plant closure expense 61,444 Employee separation costs 188,538 Contract termination costs 14,316 Brazilian business realignment: Goodwill impairment 12,260 Employee separation costs 310 2005 business realignment initiatives: U.S. voluntary workforce reduction program 9,972 69,472 U.S. facility rationalization (Las Piedras, Puerto Rico plant) 1,567 12,771 Streamline international operations (primarily Canada) 2,524 14,294 Previous business realignment initiatives 513 Total business realignment and impairment charges, net 276,868 14,576 96,537 Total net charges associated with business realignment initiatives and impairment $ 412,581 $ 11,643 $ 118,996 The charge of $123.1 million recorded in cost of sales for the global supply chain transformation program related primarily to the accelerated depreciation of fixed assets over a reduced estimated remaining useful life and costs related to inventory reductions. The $12.6 million recorded in selling, marketing and administrative expenses related primarily to project management and administration. In determining the costs related to fixed asset impairments, fair value was estimated based on the expected sales proceeds. Certain real estate with a carrying value or fair value less cost to sell, if lower, of $40.2 million was being held for sale as of December 31, 2007. Employee separation costs included $79.0 million primarily for involuntary terminations at six North American manufacturing facilities which are being closed. The facilities are located in Naugatuck, Connecticut; Reading, Pennsylvania; Oakdale, California; Smiths Falls, Ontario; Montreal, Quebec; and Dartmouth, Nova Scotia. The employee separation costs also included $109.6 million for charges relating to pension and other post-retirement benefits settlements, curtailments and special termination benefits. During the fourth quarter of 2007, we completed our annual impairment evaluation of goodwill and other intangible assets. As a result of reduced expectations for future cash flows resulting primarily from lower expected profitability, we determined that the carrying amount of our wholly-owned subsidiary, Hershey do 24 Table of Contents Brasil, exceeded its fair value and recorded a non-cash impairment charge of $12.3 million in December 2007. There was no tax benefit associated with this charge. We discuss the impairment testing results in more detail in Note 1 and Note 16 to the Consolidated Financial Statements. During the fourth quarter of 2007, we also recorded a business realignment charge of $.3 million associated with our business in Brazil. This charge was principally associated with employee separation costs. Remaining charges of approximately $5.0 million for this business realignment program are expected to be recorded in 2008. The charges (credits) recorded in cost of sales relating to the 2005 business realignment initiatives included a credit of $1.6 million in 2006 resulting from higher than expected proceeds from the sale of equipment from the Las Piedras plant and a charge of $22.5 million in 2005 resulting from accelerated depreciation related to the closure of the Las Piedras plant. The charge recorded in selling, marketing and administrative expenses in 2006 resulted from accelerated depreciation relating to the termination of an office building lease. The net business realignment charges included $7.3 million and $8.3 million for involuntary terminations in 2006 and 2005, respectively. The charges (credits) recorded in 2006 relating to previous business realignment initiatives which began in 2003 and 2001 resulted from the finalization of the sale of certain properties, adjustments to liabilities which had previously been recorded, and the impact of the settlement as to several of the eight former employees who had filed a complaint alleging that the Company had discriminated against them on the basis of age in connection with the 2003 business realignment initiatives. A settlement was reached with the remaining former employees in September 2007. The liability balance as of December 31, 2007 relating to the 2007 business realignment initiatives was $68.4 million for employee separation costs to be paid primarily in 2008 and 2009. As of December 31, 2007, the liability balance relating to the 2005 business realignment initiatives was $3.3 million. During 2007 we made payments against the liabilities recorded for the 2007 business realignment initiatives of $13.2 million principally related to employee separation and project administration. We made payments during 2007 against the liabilities recorded for the 2005 business realignment initiatives of $16.2 million related to the voluntary workforce reduction. During 2006 we made total payments of $28.0 million against the liabilities recorded for the 2005 business realignment initiatives primarily associated with the voluntary workforce reduction. Income Before Interest and Income Taxes and EBIT Margin 2007 compared with 2006 EBIT decreased in 2007 compared with 2006, principally as a result of higher net business realignment and impairment charges recorded in 2007. Net pre-tax business realignment and impairment charges of $412.6 million were recorded in 2007 compared with $11.6 million recorded in 2006, an increase of $400.9 million. The remainder of the decrease in EBIT was attributable to lower gross profit resulting primarily from higher input costs and higher selling, marketing and administrative expenses. EBIT margin declined from 20.1% in 2006 to 9.3% in 2007. Net business realignment and impairment charges reduced EBIT margin by 8.3 percentage points in 2007. Net business realignment charges reduced EBIT margin by 0.2 percentage points in 2006. The remainder of the decrease primarily resulted from the lower gross margin, in addition to higher selling, marketing and administrative expense as a percentage of sales. 2006 compared with 2005 EBIT increased in 2006 compared with 2005, primarily as a result of lower net business realignment and impairment charges associated primarily with the 2005 business realignment initiatives. Net pre-tax business realignment charges of $11.6 million were recorded in 2006 compared with $119.0 million recorded in 2005, a decrease of $107.4 million. The remainder of the increase in EBIT was attributable to lower selling, marketing and administrative expenses which were partially offset by lower gross profit resulting from higher input costs and the impact of product obsolescence. 25 Table of Contents EBIT margin increased from 17.7% in 2005 to 20.1% in 2006. Net business realignment and impairment charges reduced EBIT margin by 0.2 percentage points in 2006 and 2.5 percentage points in 2005. The remainder of the improvement in EBIT margin reflected lower selling, marketing and administrative expenses as a percentage of sales. Interest Expense, Net 2007 compared with 2006 Net interest expense was higher in 2007 than in 2006, primarily reflecting increased borrowings partially offset by lower interest rates. 2006 compared with 2005 Net interest expense was higher in 2006 than in 2005, primarily reflecting higher interest expense resulting from commercial paper borrowings to fund repurchases of Common Stock and working capital requirements, along with significant contributions to our pension plans in late 2005. Higher interest rates in 2006 also contributed to the increase in interest expense. Income Taxes and Effective Tax Rate 2007 compared with 2006 Our effective income tax rate was 37.1% for 2007 and 36.2% for 2006. The impact of tax rates associated with business realignment and impairment charges increased the effective income tax rate for 2007 by 1.1 percentage points. 2006 compared with 2005 Our effective income tax rate was 36.2% for 2006 and 2005. Net Income and Net Income Per Share 2007 compared with 2006 Net income in 2007 was reduced by $267.7 million, or $1.15 per share-diluted, and in 2006 was reduced by $7.6 million, or $.03 per share-diluted, as a result of net business realignment and impairment charges. Excluding the impact of these charges, earnings per share-diluted in 2007 decreased by $.29 as compared with 2006 as a result of lower EBIT, offset somewhat by reduced interest expense and the impact of lower weighted-average shares outstanding in 2007. 2006 compared with 2005 Net income in 2006 was reduced by $7.6 million, or $.03 per share-diluted, and in 2005 was reduced by $74.0 million, or $.30 per share-diluted, as a result of net charges associated with our 2005 business realignment initiatives which were recorded in each year. In addition to the impact of the business realignment initiatives, earnings per share-diluted in 2006 increased primarily as a result of lower selling, marketing and administrative expenses which more than offset the impact of reduced gross profit. The impact of lower weighted-average shares outstanding, net of higher interest expense, also contributed to the increase in earnings per share-diluted in 2006. 26 Table of Contents FINANCIAL CONDITION Our financial condition remained strong during 2007. Solid cash flow from operations and our liquidity, leverage and capital structure contributed to our continued investment grade credit rating by recognized rating agencies. Acquisitions and Divestitures In May 2007, we entered into an agreement with Godrej Beverages and Foods, Ltd., one of India largest consumer goods, confectionery and food companies, to manufacture and distribute confectionery products, snacks and beverages across India. Under the agreement, we invested $61.5 million during 2007 and own a 51% controlling interest in Godrej Hershey Foods and Beverages Company. Total liabilities assumed were $51.6 million. Effective in May 2007, this business acquisition was included in our consolidated results, including the related minority interest. Annual sales for this business are expected to be approximately $70.0 million. Also in May 2007, our Company and Lotte Confectionery Co., LTD., entered into a manufacturing agreement in China that will produce Hershey products and certain Lotte products for the market in China. We invested $39.0 million in 2007 and own a 44% interest. We are accounting for this investment using the equity method. In October 2006, our wholly-owned subsidiary, Artisan Confections Company, purchased the assets of Dagoba Organic Chocolates, LLC based in Ashland, Oregon, for $17.0 million. Dagoba is known for its high-quality organic chocolate bars, drinking chocolates and baking products that are primarily sold in natural food and gourmet stores across the United States. Dagoba has annual sales of approximately $8.0 million. In August 2005, Artisan Confections Company completed the acquisition of Scharffen Berger Chocolate Maker, Inc. Based in San Francisco, California, Scharffen Berger is known for its high-cacao content, signature dark chocolate bars and baking products sold online and in a broad range of outlets, including specialty retailers, natural food stores and gourmet centers across the United States. Scharffen Berger also owns and operates three specialty stores located in New York, New York and in Berkeley and San Francisco, California. Also, in August 2005, Artisan Confections Company acquired the assets of Joseph Schmidt Confections, Inc., a premium chocolate maker located in San Francisco, California. Distinctive products created by Joseph Schmidt include artistic and innovative truffles, colorful chocolate mosaics, specialty cookies, and handcrafted chocolates. We sell these products in select department stores and other specialty outlets nationwide as well as in Joseph Schmidt stores located in San Jose and San Francisco, California. The combined purchase price for Scharffen Berger and Joseph Schmidt was $47.1 million. Together, these companies have combined annual sales of approximately $25 million. Results subsequent to the dates of acquisition were included in the consolidated financial statements. Had the results of the acquisitions been included in the consolidated financial statements for each of the periods presented, the effect would not have been material. In October 2005, our wholly-owned subsidiary, Hershey Canada Inc., completed the sale of its Mr. Freeze freeze pops business for $2.7 million. 27 Table of Contents Assets A summary of our assets is as follows: December 31, 2007 2006 In thousands of dollars Current assets $ 1,426,574 $ 1,417,812 Property, plant and equipment, net 1,539,715 1,651,300 Goodwill and other intangibles 740,575 642,269 Other assets 540,249 446,184 Total assets $ 4,247,113 $ 4,157,565 The change in current assets from 2006 to 2007 was primarily due to the following: Higher cash and cash equivalents in 2007 due to the timing of cash collections; A decrease in accounts receivable primarily resulting from lower sales in December 2007 as compared with December 2006; A decrease in inventories in 2007 reflecting lower raw material and goods in process inventories resulting from reduced manufacturing requirements and the global supply chain transformation program, in addition to lower finished goods inventories as a result of working capital improvement initiatives, partially offset by an inventory build in anticipation of the relocation of certain manufacturing processes under the global supply chain transformation program; An increase in deferred income taxes primarily associated with the 2007 business realignment and impairment charges as well as impending executive retirement benefit payments; and An increase in prepaid expenses and other current assets primarily reflecting receivables associated with certain commodity transactions, and assets acquired through the Godrej Hershey Foods and Beverages Company acquisition. Property, plant and equipment was lower in 2007 primarily due to depreciation expense of $292.7 million and asset retirements, partially offset by capital additions and assets acquired through the Godrej Hershey Foods and Beverages Company acquisition. Accelerated depreciation of facilities designated for closure and certain asset retirements resulted primarily from the global supply chain transformation program. Goodwill and other intangibles increased as a result of the Godrej Hershey Foods and Beverages Company acquisition and the effect of currency translation adjustments, offset partially by a reduction resulting from the goodwill impairment charge associated with our business in Brazil. Further information is included in Note 1 and Note 16 to the Consolidated Financial Statements. The increase in other assets was primarily associated with the 2007 business acquisitions, as well as the reclassification of certain tax benefits to other assets in accordance with the adoption of Financial Accounting Standards Board ( FASB ) Interpretation No. 48, Accounting for Uncertainty in Income Taxes, an interpretation of FASB Statement No. 109 ( FIN No. 48 ). 28 Table of Contents Liabilities A summary of our liabilities is as follows: December 31, 2007 2006 In thousands of dollars Current liabilities $ 1,618,770 $ 1,453,538 Long-term debt 1,279,965 1,248,128 Other long-term liabilities 544,016 486,473 Deferred income taxes 180,842 286,003 Total liabilities $ 3,623,593 $ 3,474,142 Changes in current liabilities from 2006 to 2007 were primarily the result of the following: Higher accounts payable reflecting the effect of working capital improvement initiatives; Higher accrued liabilities primarily associated with the 2007 business realignment initiatives and higher expected employee benefit payments; and An increase in short-term debt reflecting commercial paper borrowings, partially offset by a decrease in the current-portion of long-term debt primarily resulting from the payment of 6.95% Notes due in March 2007. The increase in long-term debt in 2007 was primarily associated with debt assumed through the Godrej Hershey Foods and Beverages Company acquisition. The increase in other long-term liabilities and a corresponding decrease in deferred income taxes of $56.4 million in 2007 were associated with the reclassification of unrecognized tax benefits from deferred income taxes to other long-term liabilities in accordance with the adoption of FIN No. 48, discussed further in Note 11 to the Consolidated Financial Statements. The residual decrease in deferred income taxes is primarily attributable to the effect of the 2007 business realignment initiatives. Capital Structure We have two classes of stock outstanding, Common Stock and Class B Stock. Holders of the Common Stock and the Class B Stock generally vote together without regard to class on matters submitted to stockholders, including the election of directors. Holders of the Common Stock have one vote per share. Holders of the Class B Stock have ten votes per share. Holders of the Common Stock, voting separately as a class, are entitled to elect one-sixth of our Board of Directors. With respect to dividend rights, holders of the Common Stock are entitled to cash dividends 10% higher than those declared and paid on the Class B Stock. Hershey Trust Company, as trustee for the benefit of Milton Hershey School (the Milton Hershey School Trust or the Trust ) maintains voting control over The Hershey Company. Historically, the Milton Hershey School Trust had not taken an active role in setting our policy, nor has it exercised influence with regard to the ongoing business decisions of our Board of Directors or management. However, in October 2007, the Chairman of the Board of the Milton Hershey School Trust issued a statement indicating that the Trust continues to be guided by two key principles: first, that, in its role as controlling stockholder of the Company, it intends to retain its controlling interest in The Hershey Company and, second, that the long-term prosperity of the Company requires the Board of Directors of the Company and its management to build on its strong U.S. position by aggressively pursuing strategies for domestic and international growth. He further stated that the Milton Hershey School Trust had communicated to the Company Board that the Trust was not satisfied with the Company results and that, as a result, the Trust was actively engaged in an ongoing process, the goal of which has been to ensure vigorous Company Board focus on resolving the Company current business challenges and on implementing new growth strategies. In that release, the Trust board chairman reiterated the Trust longstanding position that the Company Board, and not the Trust board, is solely responsible and accountable for the Company management and performance. 29 Table of Contents On November 11, 2007 we announced that all of the members of our Board of Directors had resigned except for Richard H. Lenny, who was at that time our Chairman of the Board and Chief Executive Officer, David J. West, who was at that time President of the Company and currently serves as our President and Chief Executive Officer, and Robert F. Cavanaugh, who is also a member of the board of directors of Hershey Trust Company and board of managers (governing body) of Milton Hershey School. In addition, we announced that the Milton Hershey School Trust through stockholder action effected by written consent had amended the By-laws of the Company to allow the Company stockholders to fix the number of directors to serve on our Board of Directors and from time to time to increase or decrease such number of directors, expanded the size of our Board of Directors from 11 directors to 13 directors, and appointed eight new directors, including two who are also members of the board of directors of Hershey Trust Company and board of managers of Milton Hershey School. The Milton Hershey School Trust decided to explore a sale of The Hershey Company in June 2002, but subsequently decided to terminate the sale process in September 2002. After terminating the sale process, the Trustee of the Milton Hershey School Trust advised the Pennsylvania Office of Attorney General in September 2002 that it would not agree to any sale of its controlling interest in The Hershey Company without approval of the court having jurisdiction over the Milton Hershey School Trust following advance notice to the Office of Attorney General. Subsequently, Pennsylvania enacted legislation that requires that the Office of Attorney General be provided advance notice of any transaction that would result in the Milton Hershey School Trust no longer having voting control of the Company. The law provides specific statutory authority for the Attorney General to intercede, and petition the Court having jurisdiction over the Milton Hershey School Trust to stop such a transaction if the Attorney General can prove that the transaction is unnecessary for the future economic viability of the Company and is inconsistent with investment and management considerations under fiduciary obligations. This legislation could have the effect of making it more difficult for a third party to acquire a majority of our outstanding voting stock and thereby delay or prevent a change in control of the Company. In December 2000, our Board of Directors unanimously adopted a Stockholder Protection Rights Agreement ( Rights Agreement ). The Milton Hershey School Trust supported the Rights Agreement. This action was not in response to any specific effort to acquire control of The Hershey Company. Under the Rights Agreement, our Board of Directors declared a dividend of one right ( Right ) for each outstanding share of Common Stock and Class B Stock payable to stockholders of record at the close of business on December 26, 2000. The Rights will at no time have voting power or receive dividends. The issuance of the Rights has no dilutive effect, will not affect reported earnings per share, is not taxable and will not change the manner in which our Common Stock is traded. We discuss the Rights Agreement in more detail in Note 14 to the Consolidated Financial Statements. 30 Table of Contents LIQUIDITY AND CAPITAL RESOURCES Our principal source of liquidity is operating cash flows. Our net income and, consequently, our cash provided from operations are impacted by: sales volume, seasonal sales patterns, timing of new product introductions, profit margins and price changes. Sales are typically higher during the third and fourth quarters of the year due to seasonal and holiday-related sales patterns. Generally, working capital needs peak during the summer months. We meet these needs primarily by issuing commercial paper. Cash Flows from Operating Activities Our cash flows provided from (used by) operating activities were as follows: For the years ended December 31, 2007 2006 2005 In thousands of dollars Net income $ 214,154 $ 559,061 $ 488,547 Depreciation and amortization 310,925 199,911 218,032 Stock-based compensation and excess tax benefits 9,526 16,323 14,263 Deferred income taxes (124,276 ) 4,173 71,038 Business realignment and impairment charges, net of tax 267,653 7,573 74,021 Contributions to pension plans (15,836 ) (23,570 ) (277,492 ) Working capital 148,019 (40,553 ) (174,010 ) Changes in other assets and liabilities (31,329 ) 275 47,363 Net cash provided from operating activities $ 778,836 $ 723,193 $ 461,762 Over the past three years, total cash provided from operating activities was approximately $2.0 billion. In 2007, depreciation and amortization expenses increased principally as the result of the accelerated depreciation charges related to the 2007 business realignment initiatives. These amounts represented non-cash items that impacted net income and are reflected in the consolidated statements of cash flows to reconcile cash flows from operating activities. The change in cash used by deferred income taxes in 2007 primarily reflected the deferred tax benefit related to the 2007 business realignment and impairment charges. We contributed $316.9 million to our pension plans over the past three years to improve the plans funded status and to pay benefits under the non-funded plans. As of December 31, 2007, the fair value of our pension plan assets exceeded benefits obligations by $354.0 million. Over the three-year period, cash provided from or used by working capital tended to fluctuate due to sales during December and working capital management practices, including initiatives implemented during 2007 to reduce working capital. During the three-year period, cash provided from changes in other assets and liabilities primarily reflected the impact of business realignment initiatives and the related tax effects, incentive compensation, and the effect of hedging transactions. The decrease in income taxes paid in 2007 compared with 2006 primarily reflected a lower federal extension payment for 2006 income taxes and the impact of lower annualized taxable income for 2007. 31 Table of Contents Cash Flows from Investing Activities Our cash flows provided from (used by) investing activities were as follows: For the years ended December 31, 2007 2006 2005 In thousands of dollars Capital additions $ (189,698 ) $ (183,496 ) $ (181,069 ) Capitalized software additions (14,194 ) (15,016 ) (13,236 ) Business acquisitions (100,461 ) (17,000 ) (47,074 ) Proceeds from divestitures 2,713 Net cash used by investing activities $ (304,353 ) $ (215,512 ) $ (238,666 ) Capital additions were primarily associated with our global supply chain transformation program, modernization of existing facilities and purchases of manufacturing equipment for new products. Capitalized software additions were primarily for ongoing enhancement of our information systems. We anticipate total capital expenditures of $300 million to $325 million in 2008 of which approximately $150 million to $170 million is associated with our global supply chain transformation program. In May 2007, we entered into an agreement with Godrej Beverages and Foods, Ltd. to manufacture and distribute confectionery products, snacks and beverages across India. Under the agreement, we invested $61.5 million in this business during 2007. In May 2007, our Company and Lotte Confectionery Co. LTD. entered into a manufacturing agreement to produce Hershey products and certain Lotte products for markets in China. We invested $39.0 million in this business during 2007. In October 2006, our wholly-owned subsidiary, Artisan Confections Company, acquired the assets of Dagoba Organic Chocolates, LLC for $17.0 million. In August 2005, Artisan Confections Company acquired the assets of Joseph Schmidt Confections, Inc. and completed the acquisition of Scharffen Berger Chocolate Maker, Inc. The combined purchase price for Joseph Schmidt and Scharffen Berger was $47.1 million. In October 2005, our wholly-owned subsidiary, Hershey Canada Inc., sold its Mr. Freeze freeze pops business for $2.7 million. Cash Flows from Financing Activities Our cash flows provided from (used by) financing activities were as follows: For the years ended December 31, 2007 2006 2005 In thousands of dollars Net change in short-term borrowings $ 195,055 $ (163,826 ) $ 475,582 Long-term borrowings 496,728 248,318 Repayment of long-term debt (188,891 ) (234 ) (278,236 ) Cash dividends paid (252,263 ) (235,129 ) (221,235 ) Exercise of stock options 59,958 46,386 101,818 Repurchase of Common Stock (256,285 ) (621,648 ) (536,997 ) Net cash used by financing activities $ (442,426 ) $ (477,723 ) $ (210,750 ) We use short-term borrowings (commercial paper and bank borrowings) to fund seasonal working capital requirements and ongoing business needs. Additional information on short-term borrowings is included under Borrowing Arrangements below. 32 Table of Contents In January 2007, we exercised our option to purchase a warehouse and distribution facility subject to a consolidated lease arrangement and refinanced the related obligation of $38.7 million. In March 2007, we repaid $150.0 million of 6.95% Notes due in 2007. In August 2006, we issued $250 million of 5.3% Notes due in 2011 and $250 million of 5.45% Notes due in 2016. The Notes were issued under a shelf registration statement on Form S-3 filed in May 2006 described under Registration Statements below. In August 2005, we issued $250 million of 4.85% Notes due in 2015 under an August 1997 Form S-3 Registration Statement. We paid cash dividends of $190.2 million on our Common Stock and $62.1 million on our Class B Stock in 2007. Cash used for the repurchase of Common Stock was partially offset by cash received from the exercise of stock options. Repurchases and Issuances of Common Stock For the years ended December 31, 2007 2006 2005 In thousands Shares Dollars Shares Dollars Shares Dollars Shares repurchased under pre-approved share repurchase programs: Open market repurchases 2,916 $ 149,983 9,912 $ 524,387 4,085 $ 238,157 Milton Hershey School Trust repurchases 689 38,482 69 3,936 Shares repurchased to replace Treasury Stock issued for stock options and employee benefits 2,046 106,302 1,096 58,779 4,859 294,904 Total share repurchases 4,962 256,285 11,697 621,648 9,013 536,997 Shares issued for stock options and employee benefits (1,748 ) (56,670 ) (1,437 ) (44,564 ) (2,949 ) (74,438 ) Net change 3,214 $ 199,615 10,260 $ 577,084 6,064 $ 462,559 We intend to continue to repurchase shares of Common Stock in order to replace Treasury Stock shares issued for exercised stock options. The value of shares purchased in a given period will vary based on stock options exercised over time and market conditions. During 2006, we completed share repurchase programs of $250 million approved in April 2005 and $500 million approved in December 2005. In December 2006, our Board of Directors approved an additional $250 million share repurchase program. As of December 31, 2007, $100.0 million remained available for repurchases of Common Stock under this program. 33 Table of Contents Cumulative Share Repurchases and Issuances A summary of cumulative share repurchases and issuances is as follows: Shares Dollars (In thousands) Shares repurchased under authorized programs: Open market repurchases 57,436 $ 1,984,431 Repurchases from the Milton Hershey School Trust 11,918 245,550 Shares retired (1,056 ) (12,820 ) Total repurchases under authorized programs 68,298 2,217,161 Privately negotiated purchases from the Milton Hershey School Trust 67,282 1,501,373 Shares reissued for stock option obligations, supplemental retirement contributions, and employee stock ownership trust obligations (27,495 ) (710,551 ) Shares repurchased to replace reissued shares 24,767 993,579 Total held as Treasury Stock as of December 31, 2007 132,852 $ 4,001,562 Borrowing Arrangements We maintain debt levels we consider prudent based on our cash flow, interest coverage ratio and percentage of debt to capital. We use debt financing to lower our overall cost of capital which increases our return on stockholders equity. In December 2006, we entered into a five-year agreement establishing an unsecured revolving credit facility to borrow up to $1.1 billion, with an option to increase borrowings to $1.5 billion with the consent of the lenders. During the fourth quarter of 2007, the lenders approved an extension of this agreement by one year in accordance with our option under the agreement. The five-year agreement will now expire in December 2012. We may use these funds for general corporate purposes, including commercial paper backstop and business acquisitions. Due to seasonal working capital needs, share repurchases and other business activities, we announced in August 2007 that we expected borrowings to exceed $1.1 billion from time to time during the next twelve months. In lieu of increasing the borrowing limit under the five-year credit agreement, in August 2007, we entered into an additional unsecured revolving short-term credit agreement to borrow up to $300 million. Funds borrowed under the new short-term credit agreement may be used for general corporate purposes, including commercial paper backstop. The agreement will expire in August 2008. These unsecured revolving credit agreements contain certain financial and other covenants, customary representations, warranties, and events of default. As of December 31, 2007, we complied with all of these covenants. In March 2006, we entered into a short-term credit agreement establishing an unsecured revolving credit facility to borrow up to $400 million through September 2006. In September 2006, we entered into an agreement amending the short-term facility. The amended agreement reduced the credit limit from $400 million to $200 million and expired on December 1, 2006. We used the funds for general corporate purposes, including commercial paper backstop. We entered into this agreement because we expected borrowings to exceed the $900 million credit limit available under the revolving credit agreement in effect at that time. In September 2005, we entered into a short-term credit agreement establishing an unsecured revolving credit facility to borrow up to $300 million. The agreement expired in December 2005. We used the funds for general corporate purposes. We entered into this facility because we expected borrowings in late 2005 to exceed the $900 million credit limit available under the revolving credit agreement in effect at that time. Borrowing increased due to the retirement of $200 million of 6.7% Notes in October 2005, refinancing of certain consolidated lease arrangements, contributions to our pension plans, stock repurchases and seasonal working capital needs. 34 Table of Contents In addition to the revolving credit facility, we maintain lines of credit with domestic and international commercial banks. As of December 31, 2007, we could borrow up to approximately $57.0 million in various currencies under the lines of credit and as of December 31, 2006, we could borrow up to $54.2 million. Registration Statements In September 2005, we filed a shelf registration statement on Form S-3 that was declared effective in January 2006. Under this registration statement, we could offer on a delayed or continuous basis up to $750 million aggregate principal amount of additional debt securities (the $750 Million Shelf Registration Statement ). In May 2006, we filed a new shelf registration statement on Form S-3 that registered an indeterminate amount of debt securities. This registration statement was effective immediately upon filing under Securities and Exchange Commission regulations governing well-known seasoned issuers (the WKSI Registration Statement ). The WKSI Registration Statement replaces, and will be used in lieu of, the $750 Million Shelf Registration Statement for offerings of debt securities occurring subsequent to May 2006. In August 2006, we issued $250 million of 5.3% Notes due September 1, 2011, and $250 million of 5.45% Notes due September 1, 2016. These Notes were issued under the WKSI Registration Statement. Proceeds from the debt issuances and any other offerings under the WKSI Registration Statement may be used for general corporate requirements. These may include reducing existing borrowings, financing capital additions, funding contributions to our pension plans, future business acquisitions and working capital requirements. OFF-BALANCE SHEET ARRANGEMENTS, CONTRACTUAL OBLIGATIONS AND CONTINGENT LIABILITIES AND COMMITMENTS As of December 31, 2007, our contractual cash obligations by year were as follows: Payments Due by Year (In thousands of dollars) Contractual Obligations 2008 2009 2010 2011 2012 Thereafter Total Unconditional Purchase Obligations $ 1,058,200 $ 618,000 $ 277,500 $ 99,300 $ $ $ 2,053,000 Non-cancelable Operating Leases 15,376 11,901 7,458 6,314 5,419 7,937 54,405 Long-term Debt 6,104 8,034 8,240 256,596 154,103 852,992 1,286,069 Total Obligations $ 1,079,680 $ 637,935 $ 293,198 $ 362,210 $ 159,522 $ 860,929 $ 3,393,474 In entering into contractual obligations, we have assumed the risk that might arise from the possible inability of counterparties to meet the terms of their contracts. Our risk is limited to replacing the contracts at prevailing market rates. We do not expect any significant losses resulting from counterparty defaults. Purchase Obligations We enter into certain obligations for the purchase of raw materials. These obligations were primarily in the form of forward contracts for the purchase of raw materials from third-party brokers and dealers. These contracts minimize the effect of future price fluctuations by fixing the price of part or all of these purchase obligations. Total obligations for each year presented above, consists of fixed price contracts for the purchase of commodities and unpriced contracts that were valued using market prices as of December 31, 2007. 35 Table of Contents The cost of commodities associated with the unpriced contracts is variable as market prices change over future periods. We mitigate the variability of these costs to the extent we have entered into commodities futures contracts to hedge our costs for those periods. Increases or decreases in market prices are offset by gains or losses on commodities futures contracts. This applies to the extent that we have hedged the unpriced contracts as of December 31, 2007 and in future periods by entering into commodities futures contracts. Taking delivery of and making payments for the specific commodities for use in the manufacture of finished goods satisfies our obligations under the forward purchase contracts. For each of the three years in the period ended December 31, 2007, we satisfied these obligations by taking delivery of and making payment for the specific commodities. Lease Arrangement with Special Purpose Trust In January 2003, the FASB issued Interpretation No. 46, Consolidation of Variable Interest Entities, an interpretation of ARB No. 51 ( Interpretation No. 46 ). Interpretation No. 46 addresses consolidation by business enterprises of special-purpose entities ( SPEs ), such as special-purpose trusts ( SPTs ), to which the usual condition for consolidation described in Accounting Research Bulletin No. 51, Consolidated Financial Statements , does not apply because the SPEs have no voting interests or otherwise are not subject to control through ownership of voting interests. We adopted Interpretation No. 46 as of June 30, 2003, resulting in the consolidation of off-balance sheet arrangements with SPTs. As of December 31, 2007 and 2006, we had no off-balance sheet arrangements. In December 2000, we entered into a lease agreement with the owner of a warehouse and distribution facility in Redlands, California. The lease term was approximately ten years, with occupancy to begin upon completion of the facility. The lease agreement contained an option for us to purchase the facility. In January 2002, we assigned our right to purchase the facility to an SPT that in turn purchased the completed facility and leased it to us under a new lease agreement. The term of this lease agreement was five years, with up to four renewal periods of five years each with the consent of the lessor. The cost incurred by the SPT to acquire the facility, including land, was $40.1 million. We exercised our option to purchase the facility at the original cost of $40.1 million and refinanced the related obligation at the end of the lease term in January 2007. Asset Retirement Obligations Our Company has a number of facilities that contain varying degrees of asbestos in certain locations within these facilities. Our asbestos management program is compliant with current regulations. Current regulations require that we handle or dispose of this type of asbestos in a special manner if such facilities undergo major renovations or are demolished. We believe we do not have sufficient information to estimate the fair value of any asset retirement obligations related to these facilities. We cannot specify the settlement date or range of potential settlement dates and, therefore, sufficient information is not available to apply an expected present value technique. We expect to maintain the facilities with repairs and maintenance activities that would not involve the removal of asbestos. As of December 31, 2007, certain real estate associated with the closure of facilities under the global supply chain transformation program is being held for sale. We are not aware of any significant obligations related to the environmental remediation of these facilities which has not been reflected in our current estimates. Income Tax Obligations We base our deferred income taxes, accrued income taxes and provision for income taxes upon income, statutory tax rates, the legal structure of our Company and interpretation of tax laws. We are regularly audited by Federal, state and foreign tax authorities. From time to time, these audits result in assessments of additional tax. We maintain reserves for such assessments. We adjust the reserves, from time to time, based upon changing facts and circumstances, such as receiving audit assessments or clearing of an item for which a reserve has been established. Assessments of additional tax require cash payments. We are not aware of any significant income tax assessments. The amount of tax obligations is not included in the table of contractual cash obligations by year on page 35 because we are unable to reasonably predict the ultimate amount or timing of settlement of our reserves for income taxes. 36 Table of Contents ACCOUNTING POLICIES AND MARKET RISKS ASSOCIATED WITH DERIVATIVE INSTRUMENTS We use certain derivative instruments, from time to time, including interest rate swaps, foreign currency forward exchange contracts and options, and commodities futures contracts, to manage interest rate, foreign currency exchange rate and commodity market price risk exposures. We enter into interest rate swap agreements and foreign currency contracts and options for periods consistent with related underlying exposures. These derivative instruments do not constitute positions independent of those exposures. We enter into commodities futures contracts for varying periods. These futures contracts are intended to be, and are effective as hedges of market price risks associated with anticipated raw material purchases, energy requirements and transportation costs. We do not hold or issue derivative instruments for trading purposes and are not a party to any instruments with leverage or prepayment features. In entering into these contracts, we have assumed the risk that might arise from the possible inability of counterparties to meet the terms of their contracts. We do not expect any significant losses from counterparty defaults. Accounting Under Statement of Financial Accounting Standards No. 133 We account for derivative instruments in accordance with Statement of Financial Accounting Standards No. 133, Accounting for Derivative Instruments and Hedging Activities , as amended ( SFAS No. 133 ). SFAS No. 133 provides that we report the effective portion of the gain or loss on a derivative instrument designated and qualifying as a cash flow hedging instrument as a component of other comprehensive income. We reclassify the effective portion of the gain or loss on these derivative instruments into income in the same period or periods during which the hedged transaction affects earnings. The remaining gain or loss on the derivative instrument resulting from hedge ineffectiveness, if any, must be recognized currently in earnings. Fair value hedges pertain to derivative instruments that qualify as a hedge of exposures to changes in the fair value of a firm commitment or assets and liabilities recognized on the balance sheet. For fair value hedges, we reflect the gain or loss on the derivative instrument in earnings in the period of change together with the offsetting loss or gain on the hedged item. The effect of that accounting is to reflect in earnings the extent to which the hedge is not effective in achieving offsetting changes in fair value. As of December 31, 2007, we designated and accounted for all derivative instruments, including foreign exchange forward contracts and commodities futures contracts, as cash flow hedges. Additional information regarding accounting policies associated with derivative instruments is contained in Note 5 to the Consolidated Financial Statements, Derivative Instruments and Hedging Activities. The information below summarizes our market risks associated with long-term debt and derivative instruments outstanding as of December 31, 2007. Note 1, Note 5 and Note 7 to the Consolidated Financial Statements provide additional information. Long-Term Debt The table below presents the principal cash flows and related interest rates by maturity date for long-term debt, including the current portion, as of December 31, 2007. We determined the fair value of long-term debt based upon quoted market prices for the same or similar debt issues. Maturity Date 2008 2009 2010 2011 2012 Thereafter Total Fair Value In thousands of dollars except for rates Long-term Debt $ 6,104 $ 8,034 $ 8,240 $ 256,596 $ 154,103 $ 852,992 $ 1,286,069 $ 1,331,141 Interest Rate 10.0 % 10.1 % 9.9 % 5.4 % 7.0 % 6.2 % 6.2 % We calculated the interest rates on variable rate obligations using the rates in effect as of December 31, 2007. 37 Table of Contents Interest Rate Swaps In order to minimize financing costs and to manage interest rate exposure, from time to time, we enter into interest rate swap agreements. In December 2005, we entered into forward swap agreements to hedge interest rate exposure related to $500 million of term financing to be executed during 2006. In February 2006, we terminated a forward swap agreement hedging the anticipated execution of $250 million of term financing because the transaction was no longer expected to occur by the originally specified time period or within an additional two-month period of time thereafter. We recorded a gain of $1.0 million in the first quarter of 2006 as a result of the discontinuance of this cash flow hedge. In August 2006, a forward swap agreement hedging the anticipated issuance of $250 million of 10-year notes matured resulting in cash receipts of $3.7 million. The $3.7 million gain on the swap will be amortized as a reduction to interest expense over the term of the $250 million of 5.45% Notes due September 1, 2016. In October 2003, we entered into swap agreements effectively converting interest payments on long-term debt from fixed to variable rates. We converted interest payments on $200 million of 6.7% Notes due in October 2005 and $150 million of 6.95% Notes due in March 2007 from their respective fixed rates to variable rates based on the London Interbank Offered Rate, LIBOR. In March 2004, we terminated these agreements, resulting in cash receipts totaling $5.2 million, with a corresponding increase to the carrying value of the long-term debt. We amortized this increase over the terms of the respective long-term debt as a reduction to interest expense. As of December 31, 2007, and 2006 we were not a party to any interest rate swap agreements. Foreign Exchange Forward Contracts We enter into foreign exchange forward contracts to hedge transactions denominated in foreign currencies. These transactions are primarily purchase commitments or forecasted purchases of equipment, raw materials and finished goods. We also may hedge payment of forecasted intercompany transactions with our subsidiaries outside the United States. These contracts reduce currency risk from exchange rate movements. We generally hedge foreign currency price risks for periods from 3 to 24 months. Foreign exchange forward contracts are effective as hedges of identifiable, foreign currency commitments. We designate our foreign exchange forward contracts as cash flow hedging derivatives. The fair value of these contracts is classified as either an asset or liability on the Consolidated Balance Sheets. We record gains and losses on these contracts as a component of other comprehensive income and reclassify them into earnings in the same period during which the hedged transaction affects earnings. A summary of foreign exchange forward contracts and the corresponding amounts at contracted forward rates is as follows: December 31, 2007 2006 Contract Amount Primary Currencies Contract Amount Primary Currencies In millions of dollars Foreign exchange forward contracts to purchase foreign currencies $ 13.8 British pounds Australian dollars Euros $ 29.0 Australian dollars Canadian dollars Euros Foreign exchange forward contracts to sell foreign currencies $ 86.7 Canadian dollars Brazilian reais Mexican pesos 38 Table of Contents We define the fair value of foreign exchange forward contracts as the amount of the difference between the contracted and current market foreign currency exchange rates at the end of the period. We estimate the fair value of foreign exchange forward contracts on a quarterly basis by obtaining market quotes for future contracts with similar terms, adjusted where necessary for maturity differences. A summary of the fair value and market risk associated with foreign exchange forward contracts is as follows: December 31, 2007 2006 In millions of dollars Fair value of foreign exchange forward contracts and options (liability) asset $ (2.1 ) $ 1.5 Potential net loss in fair value of foreign exchange forward contracts of ten percent resulting from a hypothetical near-term adverse change in market rates $ .2 $ .2 Our risk related to foreign exchange forward contracts is limited to the cost of replacing the contracts at prevailing market rates. Commodities Price Risk Management and Futures Contracts Our most significant raw material requirements include cocoa beans, cocoa products, sugar, dairy products, peanuts and almonds. The cost of cocoa beans and cocoa products and prices for related futures contracts historically have been subject to wide fluctuations attributable to a variety of factors. These factors include: the effect of weather on crop yield; imbalances between supply and demand; currency exchange rates; political unrest in producing countries; and speculative influences. During 2007, cocoa prices traded in a relatively wide range between 74 and 95 per pound, based on the New York Board of Trade futures contract. Our costs will not necessarily reflect market price fluctuations because of our forward purchasing practices, premiums and discounts that reflect varying delivery times, and supply and demand for specific varieties and grades of cocoa beans, cocoa liquor, cocoa butter and cocoa powder. During 2007, dairy prices were significantly higher, starting the year at nearly 13 per pound and rising to 22 per pound on a class II fluid milk basis. Tight global supplies were driven by drought in Australia as well as reduced exports from the European Union due to the elimination of subsidies. Also, input costs for U.S. producers were up due to heightened grain prices impacting feed costs. Additionally, the United States Department of Agriculture adjusted their mechanism for establishing market prices of nonfat dry milk, further escalating costs. We attempt to minimize the effect of future price fluctuations related to the purchase of our raw materials by using forward purchasing to cover future manufacturing requirements generally for 3 to 24 months. We use futures contracts in combination with forward purchasing of cocoa beans and cocoa products, sugar, corn sweeteners, natural gas, fuel oil and certain dairy products primarily to provide favorable pricing opportunities and flexibility in sourcing our raw material and energy requirements. However, the dairy markets are not as developed as many of the other commodities markets and, therefore, it is not possible to hedge our costs by taking forward positions to extend coverage for longer periods of time. We use fuel oil futures contracts to minimize price fluctuations associated with our transportation costs. Our commodity procurement practices are intended to reduce the risk of future price increases and provide visibility to future costs, but also may potentially limit our ability to benefit from possible price decreases. 39 Table of Contents We account for commodities futures contracts in accordance with SFAS No. 133. We make or receive cash transfers to or from commodity futures brokers on a daily basis reflecting changes in the value of futures contracts on the New York Board of Trade or various other exchanges. These changes in value represent unrealized gains and losses. We report these cash transfers as a component of other comprehensive income. The cash transfers offset higher or lower cash requirements for the payment of future invoice prices of raw materials, energy requirements and transportation costs. Futures held in excess of the amount required to fix the price of unpriced physical forward contracts are effective as hedges of anticipated purchases. Sensitivity Analysis The following sensitivity analysis reflects our market risk to a hypothetical adverse market price movement of ten percent, based on our net commodity positions at four dates spaced equally throughout the year. Our net commodity positions consist of the amount of futures contracts we hold over or under the amount of futures contracts we need to price unpriced physical forward contracts for the same commodities. Inventories, priced forward contracts and estimated anticipated purchases not yet under contract were not included in the sensitivity analysis calculations. We define a loss, for purposes of determining market risk, as the potential decrease in fair value or the opportunity cost resulting from the hypothetical adverse price movement. The fair values of net commodity positions reflect quoted market prices or estimated future prices, including estimated carrying costs corresponding with the future delivery period. For the years ended December 31, 2007 2006 Fair Value Market Risk (Hypothetical 10% Change) Fair Value Market Risk (Hypothetical 10% Change) In millions of dollars Highest long position $ (112.5 ) $ 11.3 $ 138.4 $ 13.8 Lowest long position (460.9 ) 46.1 (147.0 ) 14.7 Average position (long) (317.0 ) 31.7 (37.3 ) 3.7 The decrease in fair values from 2006 to 2007 primarily reflected a decrease in net commodity positions, which more than offset the impact of higher prices in 2007. The negative positions primarily resulted as unpriced physical forward contract futures requirements exceeded the amount of commodities futures that we held at certain points in time during the years. Sensitivity analysis disclosures represent forward-looking statements which are subject to certain risks and uncertainties that could cause our actual results to differ materially from those presently anticipated or projected. Factors that could affect the sensitivity analysis disclosures include: significant increases or decreases in market prices reflecting fluctuations attributable to the effect of weather on crop yield; imbalances between supply and demand; currency exchange rates; political unrest in producing countries; speculative influences; and changes in our hedging strategies. 40 Table of Contents USE OF ESTIMATES AND OTHER CRITICAL ACCOUNTING POLICIES Our consolidated financial statements are prepared in accordance with GAAP. In various instances, GAAP requires management to make estimates, judgments and assumptions that affect the amounts reported in the consolidated financial statements and accompanying notes. We believe that our most critical accounting policies and estimates relate to the following: Accounts Receivable Trade Accrued Liabilities Pension and Other Post-Retirement Benefit Plans Goodwill and Other Intangible Assets Commodities Futures Contracts Management has discussed the development, selection and disclosure of critical accounting policies and estimates with the Audit Committee of our Board of Directors. While we base estimates and assumptions on our knowledge of current events and actions we may undertake in the future, actual results may ultimately differ from these estimates and assumptions. For a discussion of our significant accounting policies, refer to Note 1 of the Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements. Accounts Receivable Trade In the normal course of business, we extend credit to customers that satisfy pre-defined credit criteria. Our primary concentration of credit risk is associated with McLane Company, Inc., one of the largest wholesale distributors in the United States to convenience stores, drug stores, wholesale clubs and mass merchandisers. McLane Company, Inc. accounted for approximately 25.9% of our total accounts receivable as of December 31, 2007. As of December 31, 2007, no other customer accounted for more than 10% of our total accounts receivable. We believe we have little concentration of credit risk associated with the remainder of our customer base. Accounts Receivable Trade, as shown on the Consolidated Balance Sheets, were net of allowances and anticipated discounts. An allowance for doubtful accounts is determined through analysis of the following: Aging of accounts receivable at the date of the financial statements; Assessments of collectibility based on historical trends; and Evaluation of the impact of current and projected economic conditions. We monitor the collectibility of our accounts receivable on an ongoing basis by analyzing aged accounts receivable, assessing the credit worthiness of our customers and evaluating the impact of reasonably likely changes in economic conditions that may impact credit risks. Estimates with regard to the collectibility of accounts receivable are reasonably likely to change in the future. Information on our Accounts Receivable Trade, related expenses and assumptions is as follows: For the three-year period 2005-2007 In millions of dollars, except percents Average expense for potential uncollectible accounts $.8 Average write-offs of uncollectible accounts $2.0 Allowance for doubtful accounts as a percentage of gross accounts receivable 1% 2% We recognize the provision for uncollectible accounts as selling, marketing and administrative expense in the Consolidated Statements of Income. 41 Table of Contents If we made reasonably possible near-term changes in the most material assumptions regarding collectibility of accounts receivable, our annual provision could change within the following range: A reduction in expense of approximately $4.7 million; and An increase in expense of approximately $4.0 million. Changes in estimates for future uncollectible accounts receivable would not have a material impact on our liquidity or capital resources. Accrued Liabilities Accrued liabilities requiring the most difficult or subjective judgments include liabilities associated with marketing promotion programs and potentially unsaleable products. Liabilities associated with marketing promotion programs We recognize the costs of marketing promotion programs as a reduction to net sales along with a corresponding accrued liability based on estimates at the time of revenue recognition. Information on our promotional costs and assumptions is as follows: For the years ended December 31, 2007 2006 2005 In millions of dollars Promotional costs $ 702.1 $ 631.7 $ 583.5 We determine the amount of the accrued liability by: Analysis of programs offered; Historical trends; Expectations regarding customer and consumer participation; Sales and payment trends; and Experience with payment patterns associated with similar, previously offered programs. The estimated costs of these programs are reasonably likely to change in the future due to changes in trends with regard to customer and consumer participation, particularly for new programs and for programs related to the introduction of new products. Reasonably possible near-term changes in the most material assumptions regarding the cost of promotional programs could result in changes within the following range: A reduction in costs of approximately $16.0 million An increase in costs of approximately $3.0 million Changes in these assumptions would affect net sales and income before income taxes. Over the three-year period ended December 31, 2007, actual promotion costs have not deviated from the estimated amounts by more than 6.0%. Changes in estimates related to the cost of promotional programs would not have a material impact on our liquidity or capital resources. Liabilities associated with potentially unsaleable products At the time of sale, we estimate a cost for the possibility that products will become aged or unsaleable in the future. The estimated cost is included as a reduction to net sales. A related accrued liability is determined using statistical analysis that incorporates historical sales trends, seasonal timing and sales patterns, and product movement at retail. 42 Table of Contents Estimates for costs associated with unsaleable products may change as a result of inventory levels in the distribution channel, current economic trends, changes in consumer demand, the introduction of new products and changes in trends of seasonal sales in response to promotional programs. Over the three-year period ended December 31, 2007, costs associated with aged or unsaleable products have amounted to approximately 2% of gross sales. Reasonably possible near-term changes in the most material assumptions regarding the estimates of such costs would have increased or decreased net sales and income before income taxes in a range from $.7 million to $1.4 million. Over the three-year period ended December 31, 2007, actual costs have not deviated from our estimates by more than 1%. Reasonably possible near-term changes in the estimates of costs associated with unsaleable products would not have a material impact on our liquidity or capital resources. Pension and Other Post-Retirement Benefit Plans Overview We sponsor a number of defined benefit pension plans. The primary plans are The Hershey Company Retirement Plan and The Hershey Company Retirement Plan for Hourly Employees. These are cash balance plans that provide pension benefits for most domestic employees hired prior to January 1, 2007. We monitor legislative and regulatory developments regarding cash balance plans, as well as recent court cases, for any impact on our plans. We also sponsor two primary post-retirement benefit plans. The health care plan is contributory, with participants contributions adjusted annually, and the life insurance plan is non-contributory. We fund domestic pension liabilities in accordance with the limits imposed by the Employee Retirement Income Security Act of 1974 and Federal income tax laws. For years beginning after 2007, we will need to comply with the funding requirements of the Pension Protection Act of 2006. We fund non-domestic pension liabilities in accordance with laws and regulations applicable to those plans. We broadly diversify our pension plan assets, consisting primarily of domestic and international common stocks and fixed income securities. Short-term and long-term liabilities associated with benefit plans are primarily determined based on actuarial calculations. These calculations consider payroll and employee data, including age and years of service, along with actuarial assumptions at the date of the financial statements. We take into consideration long-term projections with regard to economic conditions, including interest rates, return on assets and the rate of increase in compensation levels. With regard to liabilities associated with post-retirement benefit plans that provide health care and life insurance, we take into consideration the long-term annual rate of increase in the per capita cost of the covered benefits. In compliance with the provisions of Statement of Financial Accounting Standards No. 87, Employers Accounting for Pensions , and Statement of Financial Accounting Standards No. 106, Employers Accounting for Postretirement Benefits Other Than Pensions , we review the discount rate assumptions and may revise them annually. The expected long-term rate of return on assets assumption ( asset return assumption ) for funded plans is by its nature of a longer duration and revised only when long-term asset return projections demonstrate that need. In September 2006, the FASB issued Statement of Financial Accounting Standards No. 158, Employers Accounting for Defined Benefit Pension and Other Postretirement Plans, an amendment of FASB Statements No. 87, 88, 106, and 132 (R) ( SFAS No. 158 ). SFAS No. 158 requires an employer that is a business entity and sponsors one or more single-employer defined benefit plans to: Recognize the funded status of a benefit plan measured as the difference between plan assets at fair value and the benefit obligation in its statement of financial position. For a pension plan, the benefit obligation is the projected benefit obligation; for any other post-retirement benefit plan, such as a retiree health care plan, the benefit obligation is the accumulated post-retirement benefit obligation. 43 Table of Contents Recognize as a component of other comprehensive income, net of tax, the gains or losses and prior service costs or credits that arise during the period but are not recognized as components of net periodic benefit cost. Measure defined benefit plan assets and obligations as of the date of the employer fiscal year-end statement of financial position. Disclose in the notes to financial statements additional information about certain effects on net periodic benefit cost for the next fiscal year that arise from delayed recognition of the gains or losses, prior service costs or credits, and transition asset or obligation. We adopted the recognition and related disclosure provisions of SFAS No. 158 as of December 31, 2006. Pension Plans Our pension plan costs and related assumptions were as follows: For the years ended December 31, 2007 2006 2005 In millions of dollars Net periodic pension benefit (income) costs $ (9.0 ) $ 25.3 $ 29.9 Assumptions: Average discount rate assumptions net periodic benefit cost calculation 5.8 % 5.4 % 5.7 % Average discount rate assumptions benefit obligation calculation 6.2 % 5.7 % 5.4 % Asset return assumptions 8.5 % 8.5 % 8.5 % Net Periodic Pension Benefit Costs We recorded net periodic pension benefit income in 2007 primarily due to the modifications announced in October 2006 which reduced future benefits under The Hershey Company Retirement Plan, The Hershey Company Retirement Plan for Hourly Employees and the Supplemental Executive Retirement Plan, the higher actual return on pension assets during 2006, and the impact of a higher discount rate assumption as of December 31, 2006. Pension income is expected to increase somewhat in 2008 due to the impact of the 2007 business realignment initiatives and the retirement or departure of certain executives. Actuarial gains and losses may arise when actual experience differs from assumed experience or when we revise the actuarial assumptions used to value the plans obligations. We only amortize the unrecognized net actuarial gains/losses in excess of 10% of a respective plan projected benefit obligation, or the fair market value of assets, if greater. The estimated recognized net actuarial gain component of net periodic pension benefit income for 2008 is $.2 million. The 2007 recognized net actuarial loss component of net periodic pension benefit income was $1.1 million. Projections beyond 2008 are dependent on a variety of factors such as changes to the discount rate and the actual return on pension plan assets. Average Discount Rate Assumption Net Periodic Benefit (Income) Costs The discount rate represents the estimated rate at which we could effectively settle our pension benefit obligations. In order to estimate this rate for 2007 and 2006, a single effective rate of discount was determined by our actuaries after discounting the pension obligation cash flows using the spot rate of matching duration from the Citigroup Pension Discount Curve. In 2005, we considered the yields of high quality securities in determining the average discount rate assumptions. High quality securities are generally considered to be those receiving a rating no lower than the second highest given by a recognized rating agency. The duration of such securities is reasonably comparable to the duration of our pension plan liabilities. 44 Table of Contents The use of a different discount rate assumption can significantly affect net periodic benefit (income) cost: A one-percentage point decrease in the discount rate assumption would have decreased 2007 net periodic pension benefit income by $10.9 million. A one-percentage point increase in the discount rate assumption would have increased 2007 net periodic pension benefit income by $4.5 million. Average Discount Rate Assumption Benefit Obligations The discount rate assumption to be used in calculating the amount of benefit obligations is determined in the same manner as the average discount rate assumption used to calculate net periodic benefit (income) cost as described above. We increased our 2007 discount rate assumption due to the increasing interest rate environment. The use of a different discount rate assumption can significantly affect the amount of benefit obligations: A one-percentage point decrease in the discount rate assumption would have increased the December 31, 2007 pension benefits obligations by $106.9 million. A one-percentage point increase in the discount rate assumption would have decreased the December 31, 2007 pension benefits obligations by $89.8 million. Asset Return Assumptions We based the expected return on plan assets component of net periodic pension benefit (income) costs on the fair market value of pension plan assets. To determine the expected return on plan assets, we consider the current and expected asset allocations, as well as historical and expected returns on the categories of plan assets. The historical geometric average return over the 20 years prior to December 31, 2007 was approximately 9.8%. The actual return on assets was as follows: For the years ended December 31, 2007 2006 2005 Actual return on assets 7.1 % 15.7 % 7.8 % The use of a different asset return assumption can significantly affect net periodic benefit (income) cost: A one-percentage point decrease in the asset return assumption would have decreased 2007 net periodic pension benefit income by $13.9 million. A one-percentage point increase in the asset return assumption would have increased 2007 net periodic pension benefit income by $13.7 million. Our asset investment policies specify ranges of asset allocation percentages for each asset class. The ranges for the domestic pension plans were as follows: Asset Class Allocation Range Equity securities 58% 85% Debt securities 15% 42% Cash and certain other investments 0% 5% As of December 31, 2007, actual allocations were within the specified ranges. We expect the level of volatility in pension plan asset returns to be in line with the overall volatility of the markets and weightings within the asset classes. As of December 31, 2007, the benefit plan fixed income assets were invested primarily in conventional instruments benchmarked to the Lehman Aggregate Bond Index and direct exposure to highly volatile, risky sectors, such as sub-prime mortgages, was minimal. 45 Table of Contents For 2007 and 2006, minimum funding requirements for the plans were not material. However, we made contributions of $15.8 million in 2007 and $23.6 million in 2006 to improve the funded status of our qualified plans and for the payment of benefits under our non-qualified pension plans. These contributions were fully tax deductible. A one-percentage point change in the funding discount rate or asset return assumptions would not have changed the 2007 minimum funding requirements for the domestic plans. For 2008, there will be no minimum funding requirements for the domestic plans and minimum funding requirements for the non-domestic plans will not be material. Post-Retirement Benefit Plans Other post-retirement benefit plan costs and related assumptions were as follows: For the years ended December 31, 2007 2006 2005 In millions of dollars Net periodic other post-retirement benefit cost $ 24.7 $ 28.7 $ 24.6 Assumptions: Average discount rate assumption 5.8 % 5.4 % 5.7 % The use of a different discount rate assumption can significantly affect net periodic other post-retirement benefit cost: A one-percentage point decrease in the discount rate assumption would have increased 2007 net periodic other post-retirement benefit cost by $1.6 million. A one-percentage point increase in the discount rate assumption would have decreased 2007 net periodic other post-retirement benefit cost by $1.2 million. Other post-retirement benefit obligation assumptions were as follows: December 31, 2007 2006 In millions of dollars Other post-retirement benefit obligation $ 362.9 $ 345.1 Assumptions: Benefit obligations discount rate assumption 6.2 % 5.7 % A one-percentage point decrease in the discount rate assumption would have increased the December 31, 2007 other post-retirement benefits obligations by $32.6 million. A one-percentage point increase in the discount rate assumption would have decreased the December 31, 2007 other post-retirement benefits obligations by $28.0 million. Goodwill and Other Intangible Assets We account for goodwill and other intangible assets in accordance with Statement of Financial Accounting Standards No. 142, Goodwill and Other Intangible Assets . This standard classifies intangible assets into three categories: (1) intangible assets with definite lives subject to amortization; (2) intangible assets with indefinite lives not subject to amortization; and (3) goodwill. For intangible assets with definite lives, the standard requires impairment testing if conditions exist that indicate the carrying value may not be recoverable. For intangible assets with indefinite lives and for goodwill, the standard requires impairment testing at least annually or more frequently if events or circumstances indicate that these assets might be impaired. We use a two-step process to evaluate goodwill for impairment. In the first step, we compare the fair value of each reporting unit with the carrying amount of the reporting unit, including goodwill. We estimate the fair 46 Table of Contents value of the reporting unit based on discounted future cash flows. If the estimated fair value of the reporting unit is less than the carrying amount of the reporting unit, we complete a second step to determine the amount of the goodwill impairment that we should record. In the second step, we determine an implied fair value of the reporting unit goodwill by allocating the reporting unit fair value to all of its assets and liabilities other than goodwill (including any unrecognized intangible assets). We compare the resulting implied fair value of the goodwill to the carrying amount and record an impairment charge for the difference. The assumptions we used to estimate fair value are based on the past performance of each reporting unit and reflect the projections and assumptions that we use in current operating plans. We also consider assumptions that market participants may use. Such assumptions are subject to change due to changing economic and competitive conditions. Our other intangible assets consist primarily of customer-related intangible assets, patents and trademarks obtained through business acquisitions. We amortize customer-related intangible assets and patents over their estimated useful lives. The useful lives of trademarks were determined to be indefinite and, therefore, we do not amortize them. We evaluate our trademarks for impairment by comparing the carrying amount of the assets to their estimated fair value. If the estimated fair value is less than the carrying amount, we record an impairment charge to reduce the asset to its estimated fair value. The estimated fair value is generally determined based on discounted future cash flows. The Company performs annual impairment tests in the fourth quarter of each year or when circumstances arise that indicate a possible impairment might exist. As a result of reduced expectations for future cash flows resulting from lower expected profitability, we determined that the carrying amount of our wholly-owned subsidiary, Hershey do Brasil, exceeded its fair value and recorded a non-cash impairment charge of $12.3 million in December 2007. There was no tax benefit associated with this charge. We discuss the impairment testing results in more detail in Note 1 and Note 16 to the Consolidated Financial Statements. We determined that none of our goodwill or other intangible assets were impaired as of December 31, 2006 and 2005 based on our annual impairment evaluation. Commodities Futures Contracts We use futures contracts in combination with forward purchasing of cocoa and other commodities primarily to reduce the risk of future price increases, provide visibility to future costs and take advantage of market fluctuations. Accounting for commodities futures contracts is in accordance with SFAS No. 133. Additional information with regard to accounting policies associated with commodities futures contracts and other derivative instruments is contained in Note 5, Derivative Instruments and Hedging Activities. Our gains (losses) on cash flow hedging derivatives were as follows: For the years ended December 31, 2007 2006 2005 In millions of dollars Net after-tax gains (losses) on cash flow hedging derivatives $ 6.8 $ 11.4 $ (6.5 ) Reclassification adjustments from accumulated other comprehensive loss to income .2 (5.3 ) 18.1 Hedge ineffectiveness (losses) gains recognized in cost of sales, before tax (.5 ) 2.0 (2.0 ) We reflected reclassification adjustments related to gains or losses on commodities futures contracts in cost of sales. No gains or losses on commodities futures contracts resulted because we discontinued a hedge due to the probability that the forecasted hedged transaction would not occur. 47 Table of Contents We recognized no components of gains or losses on commodities futures contracts in income due to excluding such components from the hedge effectiveness assessment. The amount of net losses on cash flow hedging derivatives, including foreign exchange forward contracts and commodities futures contracts, expected to be reclassified into earnings in the next twelve months was approximately $5.0 million after tax as of December 31, 2007. This amount is primarily associated with commodities futures contracts. RETURN MEASURES We believe that two important measures of profitability are operating return on average stockholders equity and operating return on average invested capital. These operating return measures calculated in accordance with GAAP are presented on the SIX-YEAR CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL SUMMARY on page 18 with the directly comparable Non-GAAP operating return measures. The Non-GAAP operating return measures are calculated using Non-GAAP Income excluding items affecting comparability. A reconciliation of Net Income presented in accordance with GAAP to Non-GAAP Income excluding items affecting comparability is provided on pages 19 and 20, along with the reasons why we believe that the use of Non-GAAP Income in these calculations provides useful information to investors. Operating Return on Average Stockholders Equity Operating return on average stockholders equity is calculated by dividing net income by the average of beginning and ending stockholders equity. To calculate Non-GAAP operating return on average stockholders equity, we define Non-GAAP Income as net income adjusted to exclude certain items. These items include the following: After-tax effect of the business realignment and impairment charges in 2007, 2006, 2005, 2003 and 2002 Adjustment to income tax contingency reserves which reduced the provision for income taxes in 2004 After-tax gain on the sale of a group of our gum brands in 2003 After-tax effect of incremental expenses to explore the possible sale of our Company in 2002 Our operating return on average stockholders equity, GAAP basis, was 33.6% in 2007. Our Non-GAAP operating return on average stockholders equity was 75.5% in 2007. The decrease in operating return on average stockholders equity in 2007 was principally due to lower income. Over the last six years, our Non-GAAP operating return on stockholders equity has ranged from 32.8% in 2002 to 75.5% in 2007. Operating Return on Average Invested Capital Operating return on average invested capital is calculated by dividing earnings by average invested capital. Average invested capital consists of the annual average of the beginning and ending balances of long-term debt, deferred income taxes and stockholders equity. For the calculation of operating return on average invested capital, GAAP basis, earnings is defined as net income adjusted to add back the after-tax effect of interest on long-term debt. For the calculation of the Non-GAAP operating return measure, we define earnings as net income adjusted to add back the after-tax effect of interest on long-term debt excluding the following: After-tax effect of the business realignment and impairment charges in 2007, 2006, 2005, 2003 and 2002 Adjustment to income tax contingency reserves on the provision for income taxes in 2004 48 Table of Contents After-tax gain on the sale of a group of our gum brands in 2003 After-tax effect of incremental expenses to explore the possible sale of our Company in 2002 Our operating return on average invested capital, GAAP basis, was 12.4% in 2007. Our Non-GAAP operating return on average invested capital was 25.0% in 2007. Over the last six years, our Non-GAAP operating return on average invested capital has ranged from 18.9% in 2002 and 2003 to 26.8% in 2005 and 2006. OUTLOOK The outlook section contains a number of forward-looking statements, all of which are based on current expectations. Actual results may differ materially. Refer to Risk Factors beginning on page 9 for information concerning the key risks to achieving our future performance goals. The year ended December 31, 2007 was very difficult. We experienced sharp increases in the cost of commodities, particularly costs for dairy products. These cost increases totaled approximately $100 million and reduced gross margin by approximately 240 basis points. We also experienced increased competitive activity and changing consumer trends toward premium and trade-up product segments that affected our growth and profitability. In the face of these challenges, we did not have adequate product innovation and sufficient brand support or retail execution in our core U.S. market. Additionally, we continued to invest in key international markets. We expect this environment to continue into 2008 with continued increases in input costs versus 2007 of approximately $100 million, reducing gross margin by 200 basis points in 2008. We will also incur higher costs for increased investment in brand support and selling capabilities in the U.S., while we are taking steps to enhance product innovation across our portfolio. We will also be continuing to invest in key international markets, particularly China and India. To offset higher input costs, we are implementing aggressive productivity and cost savings initiatives in addition to those already underway as part of our global supply chain transformation program. We are also pursuing opportunities to improve price realization, including list price increases effective in January 2008. However, these pricing actions will only partly offset input cost increases and expenses associated with investment spending plans, resulting in lower EBIT and EPS, excluding items affecting comparability. We expect consolidated net sales to grow 3% to 4% in 2008. Our primary goal is to stabilize business performance in the United States. We will continue to emphasize our iconic brands, particularly Reese s, Hershey and Kisses. We will also introduce Hershey Bliss , Signatures packaged candy and Starbucks branded chocolates to more fully participate in the rapidly growing premium and trade-up segments of the chocolate category. We will also have the full-year benefit of increased levels of retail coverage and increased investment in brand support. For the remainder of the Americas, we expect increases in net sales and profitability from Canada and Mexico, offset somewhat in Brazil as we restructure our business. Global growth is a key component of our future. We plan continued focus on growth in Asia, particularly China and India. We expect Godrej Hershey Foods and Beverages Company to have a positive impact on net sales for 2008 as we geographically expand the sugar confectionery business and introduce milk mix products. We anticipate net sales increases in China as the product line we introduced in 2007 gains distribution and consumer trial. We also anticipate the opening of Hershey Shanghai Chocolate World prior to the 2008 Olympics to gain additional exposure for our brands. For 2008, we expect total pre-tax business realignment and impairment charges for our global supply chain transformation program and restructuring our business in Brazil to be in the range of $140 to $160 million. We expect costs of approximately $85 million to be included in cost of sales, primarily for accelerated depreciation, 49 Table of Contents and approximately $20 million to be included in selling, marketing and administrative expenses for start up costs and program management. The remainder of these costs will be included in business realignment and impairment charges. Total charges associated with our business realignment initiatives in 2008 are expected to reduce diluted earnings per share by $0.37 to $0.42. As a result of higher input costs and increased investment in trade and consumer promotional programs and advertising, along with investment in our international businesses, we expect EBIT to decrease in 2008, excluding the impact of business realignment and impairment charges. We expect EBIT margin to decline due to investments in advertising, selling capabilities and building infrastructure for our international businesses. Business realignment and impairment charges associated with our global supply chain transformation program and the restructuring of our business in Brazil will reduce net income and earnings per share in 2008. Excluding the impact of these business realignment initiatives, net income is expected to decline reflecting the increased investments in our businesses. As a result, non-GAAP earnings per share-diluted excluding items affecting comparability is expected to be within the $1.85 to $1.90 range for 2008. A reconciliation of GAAP and non-GAAP items to the Company earnings per share-diluted outlook is as follows: 2008 Expected EPS-diluted in accordance with GAAP $ 1.43-1.53 Total business realignment and impairment charges $ 0.37-0.42 Non-GAAP expected EPS-diluted excluding items affecting comparability $ 1.85-1.90 We believe that the disclosure of non-GAAP expected EPS-diluted excluding items affecting comparability provides investors with a better comparison of expected year-to-year operating results. A reconciliation of certain historical results presented in accordance with GAAP to non-GAAP financial measures excluding items affecting comparability is provided on pages 19 and 20, along with the reasons why we believe the use of non-GAAP financial measures provides useful information to investors. We anticipate cash flows from operating activities in 2008 to be strong, but below 2007 levels as a result of reduced working capital improvements compared with 2007 and increased cash required for our global supply chain transformation program. We expect working capital to improve in 2008, primarily driven by inventory reductions in the second half of the year, but not at the levels experienced in 2007. Net cash provided from operating activities is expected to exceed cash requirements for capital additions, capitalized software additions and anticipated dividend payments. For 2008, we expect total capital additions to be in the range of $300 to $325 million, with $150 to $170 million associated with our global supply chain transformation program. SUBSEQUENT EVENT In January 2008, we announced an increase in the wholesale prices of our domestic confectionery line, effective immediately. The price increase applied to our standard bar, king-size bar, 6-pack and vending lines and represented a weighted average increase of approximately thirteen percent on these items. These products represent approximately one-third of our U.S. confectionery portfolio. The price changes approximated a three percent price increase over our entire domestic product line. We implemented this action to help partially offset increases in input costs, including raw materials, fuel, utilities and transportation. NEW ACCOUNTING PRONOUNCEMENTS In September 2006, the FASB issued Statement of Financial Accounting Standards No. 157, Fair Value Measurements ( SFAS No. 157 ). SFAS No. 157 establishes a framework for measuring fair value in GAAP, and expands disclosures about fair value measurements. SFAS No. 157 applies under other accounting 50 Table of Contents pronouncements that require or permit fair value measurements. SFAS No. 157 is effective for our Company beginning January 1, 2008 as it applies to the accounting for financial assets and liabilities, as well as for any other assets and liabilities that are carried at fair value on a recurring basis in the financial statements. We do not expect any significant changes to our financial accounting and reporting as a result of this new accounting standard. In February 2007, the FASB issued Statement of Financial Accounting Standards No. 159, The Fair Value Option for Financial Assets and Financial Liabilities ( SFAS No. 159 ). SFAS No. 159 permits entities to choose to measure many financial instruments and certain other items at fair value and establishes presentation and disclosure requirements designed to facilitate comparisons between entities that choose different measurement attributes for similar types of assets and liabilities. SFAS No. 159 is effective for our Company beginning January 1, 2008 for financial assets and liabilities, as well as for any other assets and liabilities that are carried at fair value on a recurring basis in the financial statements. We do not expect any significant changes to our financial accounting and reporting as a result of this new accounting standard. In December 2007, the FASB issued Statement of Financial Accounting Standards No. 141 (revised 2007), Business Combinations ( SFAS No. 141R ). The objective of SFAS No. 141R is to improve the relevance, representational faithfulness, and comparability of the information that a reporting entity provides in its financial reports about a business combination and its effects. SFAS No. 141R establishes principles and requirements for how the acquirer: a. Recognizes and measures in its financial statements the identifiable assets acquired, the liabilities assumed and any noncontrolling interest in the acquiree; b. Recognizes and measures the goodwill acquired in the business combination or a gain from a bargain purchase; c. Determines what information to disclose to enable users of the financial statements to evaluate the nature and financial effects of the business combination. SFAS No. 141R is effective for our Company for business combinations occurring subsequent to December 31, 2008. We have not yet determined the impact of the adoption of this accounting standard. In December 2007, the FASB also issued Statement of Financial Accounting Standards No. 160, Noncontrolling Interests in Consolidated Financial Statements, an amendment of ARB No. 51 ( SFAS No. 160 ). The objective of SFAS No. 160 is to improve the relevance, comparability and transparency of the financial information that a reporting entity provides in its consolidated financial statements by establishing accounting and reporting standards for the noncontrolling interest in a subsidiary and for the deconsolidation of a subsidiary. SFAS No. 160 is effective for our Company as of January 1, 2009. We have not yet determined the impact of the adoption of this new accounting standard.
