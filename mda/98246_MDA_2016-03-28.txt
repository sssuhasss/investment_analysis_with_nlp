Item 7. Management's Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations. The following discussion and analysis should be read in conjunction with the Company's consolidated financial statements and related notes. All references to years relate to fiscal years which ended on January 31 of the following calendar year. KEY STRATEGIES The Company's key strategies are: To enhance customer awareness of the TIFFANY & CO. trademark (the Brand ), its heritage, its products and its association with quality and luxury. The Brand is the single most important asset of Tiffany and, indirectly, of the Company. Management intends to continue to invest in marketing and public relations programs designed to build awareness of the Brand, its heritage and its products, as well as to enhance the Brand association among consumers with quality and luxury. Management monitors these efforts and the strength of the Brand through market research. To maintain an active product development program. The Company's product development strategy is to introduce new design collections periodically and expand certain existing collections annually, both of which are intended to appeal to the Company existing customer base as well as to new customers. The Company is also investing in the watch category, which it deems appropriate for the Brand and which presents an incremental long-term growth opportunity. To enhance the customer experience through engaging service and store environments. To ensure a superior shopping experience, the Company employs highly-qualified sales and customer service professionals, focuses on enhancing sales and product training programs, and is investing in enhancing its information systems for customer relationship management. The Company also focuses on enhancing the design of its stores, as well as the creative visual presentation of its merchandise, to provide an engaging luxury experience in both its new and existing stores. To expand and optimize its global distribution base. Management intends to continue to expand and optimize its global store base by evaluating potential markets for new TIFFANY & CO. stores, as well as through the renovation, relocation, or, in certain cases, the closure of existing stores. Management will also continue to evaluate opportunities for the growth of its e-commerce websites. Management recognizes that over-saturation of any market could diminish the distinctive appeal of the Brand, but believes that there are a number of potential worldwide locations remaining that meet financial and Brand requirements. To maintain substantial control over product supply through direct diamond sourcing and internal jewelry manufacturing. The Company has developed substantial product supply infrastructure related to the procurement and processing of diamonds and to the manufacturing of jewelry. This infrastructure is intended to ensure adequate product supply and favorable product costs while maintaining the Company's TIFFANY & CO. K- 29 Table of Contents quality standards. The Company will continue to supplement its internal capabilities through its network of external suppliers. Through the efforts above, management is committed to the following long-term financial objectives: To achieve improved operating margins. Management's long-term objective is to improve operating margin through gross margin improvement, which includes controlling product input costs, realizing greater efficiencies in its product supply chain and adjusting retail prices when appropriate. Additionally, management is focused on enhancing profitability by controlling selling, general and administrative expenses, including by enhancing its global procurement capabilities, thereby generating sales leverage on fixed costs. These efforts are intended to generate a higher rate of operating earnings growth relative to sales growth. To increase store productivity. Management is committed to growing sales per square foot by increasing consumer traffic and by enhancing the store environment and customer experience, increasing the percentage of store visitors who make a purchase. To improve asset productivity and cash flow. Management's long-term objective is to maintain inventory growth at a rate less than sales growth, with greater focus on efficiencies in product sourcing and manufacturing as well as optimizing store inventory levels, all of which is intended to contribute to improvements in cash flow and return on assets. To maintain a capital structure that provides financial strength and flexibility to pursue strategic initiatives and allows for the return of excess capital to shareholders. 2015 SUMMARY On a constant-exchange-rate basis (see "Non-GAAP Measures" below), worldwide net sales increased 2% due to growth in Europe, Japan and Asia-Pacific, while sales in the Americas decreased modestly from the prior year; comparable store sales were approximately equal to the prior year. The increase in sales was attributed to price increases and a shift in sales mix toward higher-priced products while there were unit declines across most categories and regions. As reported, worldwide net sales decreased 3% to $4.1 billion due to lower sales in all regions and product categories, which management attributed in part to the negative effect of currency translation and, in the Americas, to lower foreign tourist spending. The Company added a net of 12 TIFFANY & CO. stores (opening 11 in Asia-Pacific, three in the Americas and two in Europe, while closing three in Asia-Pacific and one in the Americas). The Company expanded its offerings within several existing jewelry collections and introduced its new TIFFANY & CO. brand watch collections. Excluding certain expenses in 2015 and 2014 (see "Non-GAAP Measures" below), earnings from operations as a percentage of net sales ("operating margin") decreased 1.3 percentage points due to higher SG&A expenses and the resulting sales deleveraging of SG&A expenses, which was only TIFFANY & CO. K- 30 Table of Contents partly offset by a higher gross margin. As reported, operating margin decreased 2.5 percentage points. Net earnings decreased 9% in 2015 excluding certain expenses recorded in 2015 and 2014 (see "Non-GAAP Measures" below). As reported, net earnings of $463.9 million , or $3.59 per diluted share, were 4% below the prior year. Inventories, net decreased 6% as reported, or 4% when excluding the translation effect of the strengthening U.S. dollar. Free cash flow (see "Non-GAAP Measures" below) was an inflow of $560.9 million in 2015 , compared with $367.7 million in 2014 . The Company returned cash to shareholders by continuing to pay regular quarterly dividends (which were increased 5% during the year to $0.40 per quarter, or an annualized rate of $1.60 per share) and spending $220.4 million to repurchase 2.8 million shares of its Common Stock. RESULTS OF OPERATIONS Non-GAAP Measures The Company reports information in accordance with U.S. Generally Accepted Accounting Principles ("GAAP"). The Company's management does not, nor does it suggest that investors should, consider non-GAAP financial measures in isolation from, or as a substitute for, financial information prepared in accordance with GAAP. The Company presents such non-GAAP financial measures in reporting its financial results to provide investors with an additional tool to evaluate the Company's operating results. These non-GAAP financial measures presented here may not be comparable to similarly-titled measures used by other companies. TIFFANY & CO. K- 31 Table of Contents Net Sales . The Company's reported net sales reflect either a translation-related benefit from strengthening foreign currencies or a detriment from a strengthening U.S. dollar. Internally, management monitors and measures its sales performance on a non-GAAP basis that eliminates the positive or negative effects that result from translating sales made outside the U.S. into U.S. dollars ("constant-exchange-rate basis"). Management believes this constant-exchange-rate basis provides a more representative assessment of sales performance and provides better comparability between reporting periods. The following table reconciles the sales percentage increases (decreases) from the GAAP to the non-GAAP basis versus the previous year: 2015 2014 GAAP Reported Translation Effect Constant- Exchange- Rate Basis GAAP Reported Translation Effect Constant- Exchange- Rate Basis Net Sales: Worldwide (3 )% (5 )% 2 % 5 % (2 )% 7 % Americas (4 ) (2 ) (2 ) 6 6 Asia-Pacific (2 ) (5 ) 3 9 (1 ) 10 Japan (2 ) (12 ) 10 (4 ) (8 ) 4 Europe (1 ) (13 ) 12 8 8 Other (13 ) (13 ) 18 18 Comparable Store Sales: Worldwide (6 )% (6 )% % 2 % (2 )% 4 % Americas (6 ) (2 ) (4 ) 5 (1 ) 6 Asia-Pacific (5 ) (5 ) 3 (1 ) 4 Japan (7 ) (12 ) 5 (7 ) (8 ) 1 Europe (5 ) (14 ) 9 (1 ) (1 ) Other (15 ) (15 ) 8 8 Comparable Store Sales. Comparable store sales include only sales transacted in Company-operated stores open for more than 12 months. Sales for relocated stores are included in comparable store sales if the relocation occurs within the same geographical market. Sales for a new store are not included in comparable store sales if that store resulted from a relocation from one department store to another or from a department store to a free-standing location. In all markets, the results of a store in which the square footage has been expanded or reduced remain in the comparable store base. TIFFANY & CO. K- 32 Table of Contents Statements of Earnings. Internally, management monitors and measures its earnings performance excluding certain items listed below. Management believes excluding such items presents the Company's results on a more comparable basis to the corresponding period in the prior year, thereby providing investors with an additional perspective to analyze the results of operations of the Company. The following tables reconcile certain GAAP amounts to non-GAAP amounts: (in millions, except per share amounts) GAAP Impairment charges a Specific cost-reduction initiatives b Non-GAAP Year Ended January 31, 2016 Selling, general and administrative expenses $ 1,731.2 $ (37.9 ) $ (8.8 ) $ 1,684.5 As a % of sales 42.2 % 41.0 % Earnings from operations 760.1 37.9 8.8 806.8 As a % of sales 18.5 % 19.7 % Net earnings 463.9 24.3 5.6 493.8 Diluted earnings per share 3.59 0.19 0.05 3.83 a Expenses associated with impairment charges related to a financing arrangement with Koidu Limited (see "Financing Arrangements with Diamond Mining and Exploration Companies"). b Expenses associated with specific cost-reduction initiatives which included severance related to staffing reductions and subleasing of certain office space for which only a portion of the Company's future rent obligations will be recovered.

Financial Statements and Supplementary Data - Note J - Commitments and Contingencies" for further information. e Expenses associated with specific cost-reduction initiatives which included severance related to staffing reductions and subleasing of certain office space for which only a portion of the Company's future rent obligations will be recovered. Free Cash Flow. Internally, management monitors its cash flow on a non-GAAP basis. The ability to generate free cash flow demonstrates how much cash the Company has available for discretionary and non-discretionary purposes after deduction of capital expenditures. The Company's operations require regular capital expenditures for the opening, renovation and expansion of stores and distribution and manufacturing facilities as well as ongoing investments in information technology. Management believes this provides a more representative assessment of operating cash flows. The following table reconciles GAAP net cash provided by operating activities to non-GAAP free cash flow: Years Ended January 31, ( in millions) 2016 2015 Net cash provided by operating activities $ 813.6 $ 615.1 Less: Capital expenditures (252.7 ) (247.4 ) Free cash inflow $ 560.9 $ 367.7 TIFFANY & CO. K- 34 Table of Contents Net Sales Net sales by segment were as follows: (in millions) 2015 2014 2013 2015 vs 2014 % Change 2014 vs 2013 % Change Americas $ 1,947.0 $ 2,033.5 $ 1,926.9 (4 )% 6 % Asia-Pacific 1,003.1 1,025.2 944.7 (2 ) 9 Japan 541.3 554.3 578.6 (2 ) (4 ) Europe 505.7 513.3 476.2 (1 ) 8 Other 107.8 123.6 104.7 (13 ) 18 $ 4,104.9 $ 4,249.9 $ 4,031.1 (3 )% 5 % Americas includes sales in 124 Company-operated TIFFANY & CO. stores in the United States, Canada and Latin America, as well as sales of TIFFANY & CO. products in certain of those markets through business-to-business, Internet, catalog and wholesale operations. Americas represented 47% of worldwide net sales in 2015 and 48% in both 2014 and 2013 , while sales in the U.S. represented 88% of net sales in the Americas in 2015 , 2014 and 2013 . Asia-Pacific includes sales in 81 Company-operated TIFFANY & CO. stores, as well as sales of TIFFANY & CO. products in certain markets through Internet and wholesale operations. Asia-Pacific represented 24% , 24% and 23% of worldwide net sales in 2015 , 2014 and 2013 . Sales in Greater China represented more than half of Asia-Pacific's net sales in those same periods. Japan includes sales in 56 Company-operated TIFFANY & CO. stores, as well as sales of TIFFANY & CO. products through business-to-business, Internet and wholesale operations. Japan represented 13% , 13% and 14% of worldwide net sales in 2015 , 2014 and 2013 . Europe includes sales in 41 Company-operated TIFFANY & CO. stores, as well as sales of TIFFANY & CO. products in certain markets through the Internet. Europe represented 12% of worldwide net sales in 2015 , 2014 and 2013 . Sales in the United Kingdom ("U.K.") represent approximately 40% of European net sales. Other consists of all non-reportable segments, including the Emerging Markets region, which consists of retail sales in five TIFFANY & CO. stores in the U.A.E. and wholesale sales of TIFFANY & CO. merchandise to independent distributors for resale in certain emerging markets (primarily in the Middle East). In addition, Other includes wholesale sales of diamonds obtained through bulk purchases that were subsequently deemed not suitable for the Company's needs as well as earnings received from a third-party licensing agreement. Net Sales 2015 compared with 2014 . In 2015 , worldwide net sales decreased $145.0 million , or 3% , due to lower sales in all regions. The strengthening of the U.S. dollar versus other currencies had the translation effect of reducing worldwide net sales growth by 5%, with net sales on a constant-exchange-rate basis increasing 2% (due to growth in Europe, Japan and Asia-Pacific, while sales in the Americas decreased modestly from the prior year). In 2015 , by product category, as reported in U.S. dollars on a GAAP basis, the engagement jewelry & wedding bands category decreased $74.9 million , or 6% (reflecting decreases in both solitaire diamond rings and wedding bands); the fashion jewelry category decreased $39.1 million , or 2% (reflecting a decline in sales of entry-level price point jewelry, largely in silver, partly offset by growth in gold jewelry TIFFANY & CO. K- 35 Table of Contents sales); and the statement, fine & solitaire jewelry category decreased $19.4 million , or 2% (reflecting lower sales of fine jewelry partly offset by higher statement jewelry sales). Changes in net sales by reportable segment were as follows: (in millions) Comparable Store Sales Non-comparable Store Sales Wholesale/Other Total Americas $ (103.5 ) $ 12.9 $ 4.1 $ (86.5 ) Asia-Pacific (46.0 ) 32.7 (8.8 ) (22.1 ) Japan (36.4 ) 9.6 13.8 (13.0 ) Europe (24.0 ) 11.7 4.7 (7.6 ) Americas . In 2015 , total sales decreased $86.5 million , or 4% , while on a constant-exchange-rate basis, total sales decreased 2% and comparable store sales decreased 4% . Management attributed the decrease in total sales and comparable store sales on a constant-exchange-rate basis to lower foreign tourist spending in the U.S. (which management believes was the result of a strong U.S. dollar) as well as to lower sales to U.S. customers. There was strong sales growth in Canada and Latin America. Changes in jewelry sales (which represent 89% of America's total sales) relative to the prior year were as follows: Average Price per Unit Sold, as reported Currency Translation Average Price per Unit Sold, constant-exchange-rate basis Number of Units Sold Change in Jewelry Sales 6 % (2 )% 8 % (11 )% The decrease in the number of jewelry units sold reflected decreases across all categories, especially in entry-level price point silver jewelry. On a constant-exchange-rate basis, management attributed the increase in the average price per jewelry unit sold to price increases and a shift in sales mix toward higher-priced products within the fashion jewelry category and toward statement jewelry. Asia-Pacific. In 2015 , total sales decreased $22.1 million , or 2% , while on a constant-exchange-rate basis, total sales increased 3%. The increase in total sales on a constant-exchange-rate basis was primarily due to sales growth in China and Australia partly offset by declines in Hong Kong; comparable store sales were unchanged. Changes in jewelry sales (which represent 98% of Asia-Pacific's total sales) relative to the prior year were as follows: Average Price per Unit Sold, as reported Currency Translation Average Price per Unit Sold, constant-exchange-rate basis Number of Units Sold Change in Jewelry Sales 4 % (5 )% 9 % (6 )% The decrease in the number of jewelry units sold occurred in entry-level price point silver jewelry and fine jewelry. On a constant-exchange-rate basis, management attributed the increase in the average price per jewelry unit sold to price increases and a shift in sales mix toward higher-priced products within the fashion jewelry category and toward statement jewelry. TIFFANY & CO. K- 36 Table of Contents Japan. In 2015 , total sales decreased $13.0 million , or 2% , while on a constant-exchange-rate basis, total sales increased 10% and comparable store sales increased 5% . Management attributed the increase in total sales and comparable store sales on a constant-exchange-rate basis primarily to higher spending by foreign tourists. Changes in jewelry sales (which represent 93% of Japan's total sales) relative to the prior year were as follows: Average Price per Unit Sold, as reported Currency Translation Average Price per Unit Sold, constant-exchange-rate basis Number of Units Sold Change in Jewelry Sales (2 )% (12 )% 10 % % On a constant-exchange-rate basis, management attributed the increase in the average price per jewelry unit sold to price increases and a shift in sales mix toward higher-priced products. Europe. In 2015 , total sales decreased $7.6 million , or 1% , while on a constant-exchange-rate basis, total sales increased 12% and comparable store sales increased 9% . The increase in total sales and comparable store sales on a constant-exchange-rate basis was due to growth across the region, which management attributed to higher spending by foreign tourists and, to a lesser extent, higher sales to local customers. Changes in jewelry sales (which represent 96% of Europe's total sales) relative to the prior year were as follows: Average Price per Unit Sold, as reported Currency Translation Average Price per Unit Sold, constant-exchange-rate basis Number of Units Sold Change in Jewelry Sales % (14 )% 14 % (2 )% The decrease in the number of jewelry units sold was attributed to soft demand for silver jewelry. On a constant-exchange-rate basis, management attributed the increase in average price per jewelry unit sold to price increases and a shift in sales mix toward higher-priced products. Other. In 2015 , total sales decreased $15.8 million , or 13% , partly due to a $9.2 million, or 11%, sales decline in the Emerging Markets region that largely reflected lower comparable store sales. The remainder of the decrease was related to lower wholesale sales of diamonds. Net Sales 2014 compared with 2013 . In 2014 , worldwide net sales increased $218.8 million , or 5% , due to growth in most regions. The strengthening of the U.S. dollar versus other currencies had the translation effect of reducing worldwide net sales growth by 2%, with net sales on a constant-exchange-rate basis increasing 7% (due to growth in all regions). In 2014 , by product category, as reported in U.S. dollars on a GAAP basis, the fashion jewelry category increased $137.0 million , or 8% (reflecting growth in gold jewelry); the engagement jewelry & wedding bands category increased $62.9 million , or 5% (reflecting growth in solitaire diamond rings and wedding bands); and the statement, fine & solitaire jewelry category increased $ 13.4 million , or 1% . Americas . In 2014 , total sales increased $106.6 million , or 6% , due to an 11% increase in the average price per jewelry unit sold, which management attributed to price increases and a shift in sales mix TIFFANY & CO. K- 37 Table of Contents toward higher-priced products. A 5% decline in the number of jewelry units sold was entirely due to soft demand for entry-level price point silver jewelry. Included in the $106.6 million increase is an $80.9 million, or 5%, increase in comparable store sales due to geographically broad-based growth across most of the region and a $27.8 million increase in non-comparable store sales. On a constant-exchange-rate basis, both total sales and comparable store sales increased 6% . Asia-Pacific. In 2014 , total sales increased $80.5 million , or 9% , due to a 5% increase in the average price per jewelry unit sold as well as a 4% increase in the number of jewelry units sold. Management attributed the increase in the average price to price increases and a shift in sales mix toward higher-priced products. The increase in the number of jewelry units sold reflected growth in all product categories. The $80.5 million increase reflected a $39.7 million increase in non-comparable store sales, a $24.0 million, or 3%, increase in comparable store sales and a $17.4 million increase in wholesale sales of TIFFANY & CO. merchandise to independent distributors. On a constant-exchange-rate basis, total sales increased 10% and comparable store sales increased 4% due to growth in most markets. Japan. In 2014 , total sales decreased $24.3 million , or 4% , and comparable store sales decreased $35.2 million, or 7%, due to the negative effects of currency translation. On a constant-exchange-rate basis, total sales increased 4% due to a 9% increase in the average price per jewelry unit sold partly offset by a 5% decrease in the number of jewelry units sold across all categories. Management attributed the increase in average price to price increases and a shift in sales mix toward higher-priced products within the fashion jewelry category. Comparable store sales on a constant-exchange-rate basis increased 1% . The overall sales performance reflected significant sales growth in the first quarter prior to an increase in the consumption tax in April 2014, offset by softness in sales in the remaining quarters. Europe. In 2014 , total sales increased $37.1 million , or 8% , due to a 4% increase in both the number of jewelry units sold and in the average price per jewelry unit sold. Management attributed the increase in the number of jewelry units sold to fashion jewelry, and the increase in average price to price increases and a shift in sales mix toward higher-priced products within the fashion jewelry category. The $37.1 million increase was driven by a $43.0 million increase in non-comparable store sales. On a constant-exchange-rate basis, total sales increased 8% due to strength in continental Europe and comparable store sales decreased 1% . Other. In 2014 , total sales increased $18.9 million , or 18% , primarily due to a $10.9 million, or 14%, sales increase in the Emerging Markets region that partly reflected comparable store sales growth. The remainder of the increase was primarily related to higher wholesale sales of diamonds. Store Data . In 2015 , the Company opened 16 stores and closed four: opening three in the Americas (in the U.S., Canada and Chile), 11 in Asia-Pacific (five in China, two in Macau and one each in Korea, Singapore, Taiwan and Thailand) and two in Europe (in Spain and Switzerland) while closing one store in the Americas and three stores in Asia-Pacific. In addition, the Company relocated nine existing stores. In 2014 , the Company added a net of 6 stores: three in the Americas (two in the U.S. and one in Mexico), two in Japan, one in Asia-Pacific (in Australia) and two in Europe (in France and Russia) while closing two stores in the Americas. Sales per gross square foot generated by all company-operated stores were approximately $2,900 in 2015 , $3,100 in 2014 and $3,100 in 2013 . The decline in 2015 reflected growth in retail square footage exceeding sales growth (which was negatively affected by currency translation). TIFFANY & CO. K- 38 Table of Contents Gross Margin (dollars in millions) 2015 2014 2013 Gross profit $ 2,491.3 $ 2,537.2 $ 2,340.4 Gross profit as a percentage of net sales 60.7 % 59.7 % 58.1 % Gross margin (gross profit as a percentage of net sales) increased 1.0 percentage point in 2015 reflecting favorable product input costs that were partly offset by a shift in sales mix to higher-priced, lower-margin products. In addition, the benefit from retail price increases was partly offset by the negative effect from the strong U.S. dollar. Gross margin increased 1.6 percentage points in 2014 largely benefiting from favorable product input costs and price increases, and, to some extent, a shift in sales mix to higher-margin products, especially in the fashion jewelry category. Management periodically reviews and adjusts its retail prices when appropriate to address product input cost increases, specific market conditions and changes in foreign currencies/U.S. dollar relationships. Its long-term strategy is to continue that approach, although significant increases in product input costs or weakening foreign currencies can affect gross margin negatively over the short-term until management makes necessary price adjustments. Among the market conditions that management considers are consumer demand for the product category involved, which may be influenced by consumer confidence, and competitive pricing conditions. Management uses derivative instruments to mitigate certain foreign exchange and precious metal price exposures (see "Item 8. Financial Statements and Supplementary Data Note H - Hedging Instruments"). Management increased retail prices in both 2015 and 2014 across all geographic regions and product categories. Selling, General and Administrative Expenses (dollars in millions) 2015 2014 2013 As reported: SG&A expenses $ 1,731.2 $ 1,645.8 $ 1,555.9 SG&A expenses as a percentage of net sales 42.2 % 38.7 % 38.6 % Excluding items in "Non-GAAP Measures": SG&A expenses $ 1,684.5 $ 1,645.8 $ 1,546.5 SG&A expenses as a percentage of net sales 41.0 % 38.7 % 38.4 % SG&A expenses increased $85.4 million , or 5% , in 2015 and $89.8 million, or 6%, in 2014. SG&A expenses in those years are not comparable due to the inclusion of loan impairment charges in 2015 and the inclusion of certain expenses associated with specific cost-reduction initiatives in 2015 and 2013. See "Non-GAAP Measures" for further details. SG&A expenses in 2015 (excluding the 2015 items noted in "Non-GAAP Measures") increased $38.7 million, or 2%, largely reflecting (i) increased marketing expenses of $18.0 million, (ii) increased store occupancy and depreciation expenses of $16.5 million (related to new and existing stores) and (iii) decreased labor costs of $7.1 million (primarily lower variable labor costs for incentive compensation and sales commissions partly offset by increased costs for U.S. pension and postretirement benefit plans). The strengthening of the U.S. dollar had the effect of decreasing SG&A expense growth by 4%, and therefore, excluding this effect, SG&A expenses would have increased 6%. SG&A expenses in 2014 (excluding the 2013 items noted in "Non-GAAP Measures") increased $99.2 million, or 6%, largely reflecting (i) increased marketing expenses of $30.5 million, (ii) increased fixed TIFFANY & CO. K- 39 Table of Contents labor costs of $26.0 million (primarily increased store-related labor costs) and (iii) increased store occupancy and depreciation expenses of $22.6 million (related to new and existing stores). There was no significant translation effect on expense growth from changes in foreign currencies. The Company's SG&A expenses are largely fixed in nature. Variable costs (which include items such as variable store rent, sales commissions and fees paid to credit card companies) typically represent approximately 15 - 20% of total SG&A expenses. Arbitration Award Expense In the fourth quarter of 2013, the Company recorded a charge of $480.2 million, related to the adverse arbitration ruling between The Swatch Group Ltd. and the Company, which includes the damages, interest and other costs associated with the ruling. See "Item 8. Financial Statements and Supplementary Data - Note J - Commitments and Contingencies" for additional information. Earnings from Operations (dollars in millions) 2015 2014 2013 As reported: Earnings from operations $ 760.1 $ 891.4 $ 304.3 Operating margin 18.5 % 21.0 % 7.5 % Percentage point change from prior year (2.5 ) 13.5 (10.9 ) Excluding other operating expenses: Earnings from operations $ 806.8 $ 891.4 $ 793.9 Operating margin 19.7 % 21.0 % 19.7 % Percentage point change from prior year (1.3 ) 1.3 1.3 The change in 2015, excluding other operating expenses in 2015, reflected higher SG&A expenses and the resulting sales deleveraging of SG&A expenses, which was only partly offset by higher gross margin. The change in 2014, excluding other operating expenses in 2013, was due to an increase in gross margin. TIFFANY & CO. K- 40 Table of Contents Results by segment are as follows: (in millions) 2015 % of Net Sales 2014 % of Net Sales 2013 % of Net Sales Earnings (losses) from operations*: Americas $ 390.8 20.1 % $ 435.5 21.4 % $ 374.3 19.4 % Asia-Pacific 264.4 26.4 281.6 27.5 244.1 25.8 Japan 199.9 36.9 196.0 35.4 215.6 37.3 Europe 97.4 19.3 110.5 21.5 102.4 21.5 Other 6.4 6.0 4.9 4.0 (1.8 ) (1.8 ) 958.9 1,028.5 934.6 Unallocated corporate expenses (152.1 ) (3.7 )% (137.1 ) (3.2 )% (140.7 ) (3.5 )% Earnings from operations before other operating expenses 806.8 19.7 % 891.4 21.0 % 793.9 19.7 % Other operating expenses (46.7 ) (489.6 ) Earnings from operations $ 760.1 18.5 % $ 891.4 21.0 % $ 304.3 7.5 % * Percentages represent earnings (losses) from operations as a percentage of each segment's net sales. On a segment basis, the ratio of earnings (losses) from operations to each segment's net sales in 2015 compared with 2014 was as follows: Americas the ratio decreased 1.3 percentage points due to a decrease in net sales resulting in sales deleveraging of operating expenses partly offset by an improvement in gross margin; Asia-Pacific the ratio decreased 1.1 percentage points due to increased store-related operating expenses and marketing spending partly offset by an improvement in gross margin; Japan the ratio increased 1.5 percentage points due to leveraging of operating expenses (as operating expenses decreased at a higher rate than sales) partly offset by a decrease in gross margin attributable to currency translation; Europe the ratio decreased 2.2 percentage points resulting from increased store-related operating expenses and marketing spending, partly offset by an improvement in gross margin; and Other the ratio increased 2.0 percentage points primarily due to an improvement in gross margin offset by the deleveraging of operating expenses both of which were affected by the decrease in wholesale sales of diamonds. To a lesser extent, contributing to the increase is the improvement in the performance of retail operations in the Emerging Markets region. On a segment basis, the ratio of earnings (losses) from operations to each segment's net sales in 2014 compared with 2013 was as follows: Americas the ratio increased 2.0 percentage points resulting from an improvement in gross margin; Asia-Pacific the ratio increased 1.7 percentage points primarily due to an improvement in gross margin partly offset by increased spending for new and existing stores; TIFFANY & CO. K- 41 Table of Contents Japan the ratio decreased 1.9 percentage points due to a decrease in gross margin (primarily resulting from a reduced benefit from the Company's ongoing program to utilize Yen forward contracts for a portion of forecasted merchandise purchases); Europe the ratio was unchanged due to an improvement in gross margin offset by increased spending for new and existing stores; and Other the ratio increased 5.8 percentage points due to an improvement in the performance of retail operations in the Emerging Markets region and lower charges associated with the write-down of wholesale diamond inventory deemed not suitable for the Company's needs. Unallocated corporate expenses include costs related to administrative support functions which the Company does not allocate to its segments. Such unallocated costs include those for centralized information technology, finance, legal and human resources departments. Unallocated corporate expenses increased by $15.0 million in 2015, primarily due to increased costs associated with upgrades to the Company's information technology systems. Unallocated corporate expenses decreased by $3.6 million in 2014. Included in other operating expenses in the table above, the 2015 amount represented $37.9 million associated with impairment charges related to a financing arrangement with Koidu and $8.8 million of expenses associated with specific cost-reduction initiatives. See "Item 8. Financial Statements and Supplementary Data - Note J - Commitments and Contingencies." Included in other operating expenses in the table above, the 2013 amount represented $480.2 million of expenses associated with the adverse arbitration ruling between the Swatch Group Ltd. and the Company and $9.4 million of expenses associated with specific cost-reduction initiatives. See "Item 8. Financial Statements and Supplementary Data - Note J - Commitments and Contingencies." Interest Expense and Financing Costs Interest expense and financing costs decreased $13.9 million , or 22%, in 2015 as a result of lower interest expense on long-term debt (reflecting the October 2014 redemption of long-term debt using proceeds from the issuance of lower-rate long-term debt in September 2014) as well as lower average credit facility borrowings. Interest expense and financing costs in 2014 were approximately equal to 2013. Other Expense (Income), Net Other expense (income), net includes interest income as well as gains/losses on investment activities and foreign currency transactions. Net expense of $1.2 million in 2015 compared with net income of $2.8 million in 2014. The $4.0 million change was primarily due to foreign currency transaction losses. Other expense (income), net in 2014 decreased $10.4 million, or 79%, reflecting $7.5 million of foreign currency transaction gains related to the Arbitration Award expense that had been recorded in 2013, with the remaining $2.9 million primarily due to other foreign currency transaction losses. See "Item 8. Financial Statements and Supplementary Data - Note J - Commitments and Contingencies" and "Non-GAAP Measures" for further information. Loss on Extinguishment of Debt In 2014, the Company recorded a loss on extinguishment of debt of $93.8 million associated with the redemption of all of the aggregate principal amount outstanding of the Company's (i) $100.0 million principal amount of 9.05% Series A Senior Notes due December 23, 2015; (ii) $125.0 million principal amount of 10.0% Series A-2009 Senior Notes due February 13, 2017; (iii) $50.0 million principal amount of 10.0% Series A Senior Notes due April 9, 2018; and (iv) $125.0 million principal amount of TIFFANY & CO. K- 42 Table of Contents 10.0% Series B-2009 Senior Notes due February 13, 2019 (collectively, the "Private Placement Notes") prior to maturity in accordance with the respective note purchase agreements governing each series of Private Placement Notes, which included provisions for make-whole payments in the event of early repayment. Provision for Income Taxes The effective income tax rate was 34.7% in 2015 compared with 34.4% in 2014 and 28.8% in 2013 . In 2013, the effective income tax rate would have been 34.8% when excluding the effects of certain expenses noted in "Non-GAAP Measures". LIQUIDITY AND CAPITAL RESOURCES The Company's liquidity needs have been, and are expected to remain, primarily a function of its ongoing, seasonal and expansion-related working capital requirements and capital expenditure needs. Over the long term, the Company manages its cash and capital structure to maintain a strong financial position that provides flexibility to pursue strategic initiatives. Management regularly assesses its working capital needs, capital expenditure requirements, debt service, dividend payouts, share repurchases and future investments. Management believes that cash on hand, internally-generated cash flows, the funds available under its revolving credit facilities and the ability to access the debt and capital markets are sufficient to support the Company's liquidity and capital requirements for the foreseeable future. As of January 31, 2016 , the Company cash and cash equivalents totaled $843.6 million , of which approximately one-third was held in locations outside the U.S. where the Company has the intention to indefinitely reinvest any undistributed earnings to support its continued expansion and investments outside of the U.S. Such cash balances are not available to fund U.S. cash requirements unless the Company were to decide to repatriate such funds and incur applicable income tax charges. The Company has sufficient sources of cash in the U.S. to fund its U.S. operations without the need to repatriate any of those funds held outside the U.S. The following table summarizes cash flows from operating, investing and financing activities: (in millions) 2015 2014 2013 Net cash provided by (used in): Operating activities $ 813.6 $ 615.1 $ 154.7 Investing activities (278.2 ) (217.0 ) (246.8 ) Financing activities (422.3 ) (23.4 ) (65.4 ) Effect of exchange rates on cash and cash equivalents 0.5 9.5 (1.5 ) Net increase (decrease) in cash and cash equivalents $ 113.6 $ 384.2 $ (159.0 ) Operating Activities The Company had a net cash inflow from operating activities of $813.6 million in 2015 , $615.1 million in 2014 and $154.7 million in 2013 . The year-over-year improvement from 2014 to 2015 was primarily due to reduced inventory purchases. The change from 2013 to 2014 was primarily due to the improvement in operating performance and the timing of income tax payments and other payables. Working Capital. Working capital (current assets less current liabilities) and the corresponding current ratio (current assets divided by current liabilities) were $2.8 billion and 4.8 at January 31, 2016 compared with $2.9 billion and 5.3 at January 31, 2015 . TIFFANY & CO. K- 43 Table of Contents Accounts receivable, less allowances at January 31, 2016 were 6% higher than at January 31, 2015 . The strengthening of the U.S. dollar had the effect of decreasing accounts receivable, less allowances by 2%. Therefore, excluding that effect, accounts receivable, less allowances would have increased 8% from January 31, 2015 largely reflecting in-house credit tied to strong sales of statement jewelry (see "Item 8. Financial Statements and Supplementary Data - Note B - Summary of Significant Accounting Policies"). On a 12-month rolling basis, accounts receivable turnover was 21 times in 2015 and 2014 . Inventories, net at January 31, 2016 were 6% lower than at January 31, 2015 . Finished goods inventories decreased 7% , while combined raw material and work-in-process inventories decreased 4% . The strengthening of the U.S. dollar had the effect of decreasing inventories by 2%. Therefore, excluding that effect, inventories would have declined 4% from January 31, 2015 due to improved inventory management and reduced inventory purchases. Investing Activities The Company had a net cash outflow from investing activities of $278.2 million in 2015 , $217.0 million in 2014 and $246.8 million in 2013 . The increased outflow in 2015 was primarily due to increased purchases of marketable securities and short-term investments. The decreased outflow in 2014 was due to net proceeds received from the sale of marketable securities and short-term investments partly offset by increased capital expenditures. Marketable Securities and Short-Term Investments. The Company invests a portion of its cash in marketable securities and short-term investments. The Company had net purchases of marketable securities and short-term investments of $26.4 million during 2015 , net proceeds received from the sale of marketable securities and short-term investments of $15.2 million during 2014 and purchases of marketable securities and short-term investments of $23.5 million during 2013. Capital Expenditures. Capital expenditures are typically related to the opening, renovation and/or relocation of stores (which represented approximately half of capital expenditures in 2015 , 2014 and 2013 ), distribution and manufacturing facilities and ongoing investments in information technology. Capital expenditures were $252.7 million in 2015 , $247.4 million in 2014 and $221.4 million in 2013 , representing 6% , 6% and 5% of worldwide net sales in those respective years. The increase in 2014 reflected incremental spending for information technology systems and internal manufacturing capacity. Notes Receivable Funded. The Company has extended loans to diamond mining and exploration companies in order to obtain rights to purchase the mine's output. The Company loaned $3.1 million in 2013. Proceeds from Notes Receivable Funded. In 2014 and 2013, the Company received $15.2 million and $1.2 million of repayments associated with loans extended to diamond mining and exploration companies discussed in Notes Receivable Funded above. No such proceeds were received in 2015. Financing Activities The Company had net cash outflows from financing activities of $422.3 million in 2015 , $23.4 million in 2014 and $65.4 million in 2013 . Year-over-year changes in cash flows from financing activities are largely driven by borrowings. Additionally, the Company resumed repurchasing its Common Stock in 2014 under a new share repurchase program after it did not repurchase any of its Common Stock in 2013. TIFFANY & CO. K- 44 Table of Contents Recent Borrowings. The Company had net (repayments of) proceeds from short-term and long-term borrowings as follows: (in millions) 2015 2014 2013 Short-term borrowings: (Repayments of) proceeds from credit facility borrowings, net $ (11.3 ) $ (12.5 ) $ 49.9 Proceeds from other credit facility borrowings 24.8 19.8 89.8 Repayments of other credit facility borrowings (16.0 ) (3.4 ) (69.7 ) Net (repayments of) proceeds from short-term borrowings (2.5 ) 3.9 70.0 Long-term borrowings: Proceeds from issuances 548.0 Repayments (400.0 ) Net proceeds from long-term borrowings 148.0 Net (repayments of) proceeds from total borrowings (2.5 ) 151.9 70.0 Payments of debt extinguishment costs (included in operating activities) (93.4 ) Net (repayments) proceeds $ (2.5 ) $ 58.5 $ 70.0 Credit Facilities. In 2014, Tiffany & Co. entered into a four-year $375.0 million and a five-year $375.0 million multi-bank, multi-currency, committed unsecured revolving credit facility, including letter of credit subfacilities (collectively, the "New Credit Facilities"), resulting in a total borrowing capacity of $750.0 million. The New Credit Facilities replaced the previously existing $275.0 million three-year unsecured revolving credit facility and $275.0 million five-year unsecured revolving credit facility, which were terminated and repaid concurrently with Tiffany & Co.'s entry into the New Credit Facilities. See "Item 8. Financial Statements and Supplementary Data - Note G - Debt" for additional information. Other Credit Facilities. In 2013, Tiffany & Co.'s wholly-owned subsidiary, Tiffany & Co. (Shanghai) Commercial Company Limited ("Tiffany-Shanghai"), entered into a three-year multi-bank revolving credit agreement (the "Tiffany-Shanghai Credit Agreement"). The Tiffany-Shanghai Credit Agreement has an aggregate borrowing limit of RMB 930.0 million ( $141.4 million at January 31, 2016 ). The Tiffany-Shanghai Credit Agreement is available for Tiffany-Shanghai's general working capital requirements, which included repayment of a portion of the indebtedness under Tiffany-Shanghai's existing bank loan facilities. The six lenders that are party to the Tiffany-Shanghai Credit Agreement will make loans, upon Tiffany-Shanghai's request, for periods of up to 12 months at the applicable interest rates as announced by the People's Bank of China. The Tiffany-Shanghai Credit Agreement matures in July 2016. See "Item 8. Financial Statements and Supplementary Data - Note G - Debt" for additional information. Under all of the Company's credit facilities, at January 31, 2016 , there were $221.6 million of borrowings, $5.6 million of letters of credit issued but not outstanding and $790.8 million available for borrowing. At January 31, 2015 , there were $234.0 million of borrowings, $5.7 million of letters of credit issued but not outstanding and $772.2 million available for borrowing. The weighted-average interest rate for borrowings outstanding was 2.90% at January 31, 2016 and 3.28% at January 31, 2015 . Senior Notes. In 2014, Tiffany & Co. issued $250.0 million aggregate principal amount of 3.80% Senior Notes due 2024 (the "2024 Notes") and $300.0 million aggregate principal amount of 4.90% Senior Notes due 2044 (the "2044 Notes" and, together with the 2024 Notes, the "Senior Notes"). The Senior Notes were issued at a discount with aggregate net proceeds of $548.0 million (with an effective yield of 3.836% for the 2024 Notes and an effective yield of 4.926% for the 2044 Notes). Tiffany & Co. used the TIFFANY & CO. K- 45 Table of Contents net proceeds from the issuance of the Senior Notes to redeem $400.0 million in aggregate principal amount of long-term debt prior to their scheduled maturities which ranged from 2015 to 2019 and paid $93.4 million of debt extinguishment costs associated with the redemption. The Company used the remaining net proceeds from the sale of the Senior Notes for general corporate purposes. See "Item 8. Financial Statements and Supplementary Data - Note G - Debt" for additional information. The ratio of total debt (short-term borrowings, current portion of long-term debt and long-term debt) to stockholders' equity was 38% at January 31, 2016 and 39% at January 31, 2015 . At January 31, 2016 , the Company was in compliance with all debt covenants. Share Repurchases. In January 2011, the Company's Board of Directors approved a stock repurchase program ("2011 Program") and terminated a previously-existing program. The 2011 Program authorized the Company to repurchase up to $400.0 million of its Common Stock through open market or private transactions. The timing of repurchases and the actual number of shares to be repurchased depended on a variety of discretionary factors such as stock price, cash-flow forecasts and other market conditions. The Company suspended share repurchases during the second quarter of 2012 in order to allow for a more effective allocation of resources consistent with the Company's growth strategies. In January 2013, the Board of Directors extended the expiration date of the 2011 Program to January 31, 2014. The 2011 Program expired on January 31, 2014 with $163.8 million of unused capacity. In March 2014, the Company's Board of Directors approved a share repurchase program ("2014 Program") which authorized the Company to repurchase up to $300.0 million of its Common Stock through open market transactions. The program had an expiration date of March 31, 2017, but was terminated in January 2016 in connection with the authorization of a new program with increased repurchase capacity (as described in more detail below). Approximately $58.6 million remained available for repurchase under the 2014 Program at the time of its termination. In January 2016, the Company's Board of Directors approved a new share repurchase program ("2016 Program") which authorizes the Company to repurchase up to $500.0 million of its Common Stock through open market transactions, block trades or privately negotiated transactions and terminated the 2014 Program. Purchases under the 2014 Program were, and purchases under the 2016 Program have been, executed under a written plan for trading securities as specified under Rule 10b5-1 promulgated under the Securities and Exchange Act of 1934, as amended, the terms of which are within the Company's discretion, subject to applicable securities laws, and are based on market conditions and the Company's liquidity needs. The 2016 Program will expire on January 31, 2019. Approximately $494.0 million remained available for repurchase under the 2016 Program at January 31, 2016 . The Company's share repurchase activity was as follows: (in millions, except per share amounts) 2015 2014 2013 Cost of repurchases $ 220.4 $ 27.0 $ Shares repurchased and retired 2.8 0.3 Average cost per share $ 78.40 $ 89.91 $ Dividends. The cash dividend on the Company's Common Stock was increased once in each of 2015 , 2014 and 2013 . The Company's Board of Directors declared quarterly dividends which totaled $1.58, $1.48 and $1.34 per common share in 2015 , 2014 and 2013 with cash dividends paid of $203.4 million , $191.2 million and $170.2 million in those respective years. The dividend payout ratio (dividends as a percentage of net earnings) was 44% , 39% and 94% in 2015 , 2014 and 2013 . Dividends as a percentage of adjusted net earnings (see "Non-GAAP Measures") were 41% in 2015 and 35% in both 2014 and 2013. TIFFANY & CO. K- 46 Table of Contents At least annually, the Company's Board of Directors reviews its policies with respect to dividends and share repurchases with a view to actual and projected earnings, cash flows and capital requirements. Financing Arrangements with Diamond Mining and Exploration Companies The Company has provided financing to diamond mining and exploration companies in order to obtain rights to purchase the output from mines owned by these companies. At January 31, 2016, there was $43.8 million of principal outstanding under a financing arrangement (the "Loan") with Koidu Limited (previously Koidu Holdings S.A.) ("Koidu"). The Loan, which was entered into between Koidu and Laurelton Diamonds, Inc., a wholly owned subsidiary of the Company, in March 2011, originally provided that repayments of principal would begin in March 2013. However, in March 2013, the Company agreed to Koidu's request to defer the principal and interest payments due in 2013 to subsequent years and, in March 2014, the Company agreed to Koidu's request to provide for monthly rather than semi-annual payments of the principal payments due in 2014. The Company received such scheduled monthly payments from Koidu in 2014. On April 30, 2015, the Company also agreed to defer Koidu's principal payment due on March 30, 2015 ("2015 Amendment"), subject to certain conditions set forth in the 2015 Amendment, which were met in June 2015. In August 2015, Koidu requested that its interest payment due in July 2015 be deferred until a future date to be determined, and it advised the Company that it was likely to request a deferral of interest payments due in August and September of 2015. Based on these requests and other discussions with Koidu, in which Koidu had informed the Company that it was seeking additional sources of capital to fund ongoing operations of the mine, and with consideration given to the fact that Koidu did not respond to the Company's request for a proposed revised payment schedule for its obligations under the Loan, management believed that it was probable that the Company would be unable to collect all amounts due according to the contractual terms of the Loan, and recorded an impairment charge, and related valuation allowance, of $9.6 million in the second quarter of 2015. Additionally, the Company ceased accruing interest income on the outstanding Loan balance as of July 31, 2015. As of January 31, 2016, Koidu has not made any of its interest payments due in July 2015 and thereafter, nor its principal payment due in September 2015. The missed payments constitute events of default under the Loan. Koidu has yet to provide a proposed revised payment schedule for its obligations under the Loan. In February 2016, the Company received the results from two separate and independent reviews of Koidu's operational plans, forecasts, and cash flow projections for the mine, which were commissioned by the Company and by Koidu's largest creditor, respectively. Based on these factors, ongoing discussions with Koidu, and consideration of the possible actions that all parties, including the Government of Sierra Leone and Koidu's largest creditor, may take under the circumstances, management believes that it is probable that the portion of the amounts due under the contractual terms of the Loan that the Company will be unable to collect will be greater than originally estimated, and recorded an additional impairment charge, and related valuation allowance, of $28.3 million in the fourth quarter of 2015. The carrying amount of the Company loan receivable from Koidu, net of the valuation allowance, is $5.9 million at January 31, 2016. The Company intends to continue to participate in discussions with Koidu regarding operational plans, forecasts and cash flow projections for the mine, as well as revisions to the payment schedule for the Loan. The Company also intends to continue to participate in discussions with certain of Koidu's stakeholders, including its largest creditor and the Government of Sierra Leone. The outcome of these discussions, as well as any other developments, will inform management's ongoing evaluation of the collectability of the Loan and the accrual of interest income. It is possible that such ongoing evaluation may result in additional changes to management's assessment of collectability. While such changes in management's assessment would not have a material adverse effect on the Company's financial position or cash flows, it is possible that such a change in assessment could affect the Company's earnings in the period in which such a change were to occur. Additionally, future developments may result in Koidu TIFFANY & CO. K- 47 Table of Contents defaulting under its diamond supply agreement with the Company, in which case the Company would lose access to the mine's output, although management believes this would not have a material impact on the Company's operations. See "Item 8. Financial Statements and Supplementary Data - Note B - Summary of Significant Accounting Policies and Note J - Commitments and Contingencies" for additional information on this financing arrangement. Contractual Cash Obligations and Commercial Commitments The following is a summary of the Company's contractual cash obligations at January 31, 2016 : (in millions) Total 2016 2017-2018 2019-2020 Thereafter Unrecorded contractual obligations: Operating leases a $ 1,585.8 $ 273.6 $ 416.8 $ 297.7 $ 597.7 Inventory purchase obligations b 319.1 319.1 Interest on debt c 729.3 36.0 70.4 70.4 552.5 Other contractual obligations d 91.7 68.9 14.2 2.0 6.6 Recorded contractual obligations: Short-term borrowings 221.6 221.6 Current portion of long-term debt 84.2 84.2 Long-term debt e 800.0 800.0 $ 3,831.7 $ 1,003.4 $ 501.4 $ 370.1 $ 1,956.8 a) Operating lease obligations do not include obligations for contingent rent, property taxes, insurance and maintenance that are required by most lease agreements. Contingent rent for the year ended January 31, 2016 totaled $34.9 million . See "Item 8. Financial Statements and Supplementary Data - Note J - Commitment and Contingencies" for a discussion of the Company operating leases. b) The Company will, from time to time, secure supplies of rough diamonds by agreeing to purchase a defined portion of a mine's output. Inventory purchase obligations associated with these agreements have been estimated at approximately $100.0 million for 2016 and included in this table. Purchases beyond 2016 that are contingent upon mine production have been excluded as they cannot be reasonably estimated. c) Excludes interest payments on amounts outstanding under available lines of credit, as the outstanding amounts fluctuate based on the Company's working capital needs. d) Consists primarily of technology licensing and service contracts, fixed royalty commitments, construction-in-progress and packaging supplies. e) Amounts exclude any unamortized discount or premium. The summary above does not include the following items: Cash contributions to the Company's pension plan and cash payments for other postretirement obligations. The Company funds the Qualified Plan's trust in accordance with regulatory limits to provide for current service and for the unfunded benefit obligation over a reasonable period and for current service benefit accruals. To the extent that these requirements are fully covered by assets in the Qualified Plan, the Company may elect not to make any contribution in a particular year. No cash contribution was required in 2015, and none is required in 2016, to meet the minimum funding requirements of the Employee Retirement Income Security Act ("ERISA"). The Company TIFFANY & CO. K- 48 Table of Contents periodically evaluates whether to make discretionary cash contributions to the Qualified Plan, and currently does not anticipate making such contributions in 2016. This expectation is subject to change based on management's assessment of a variety of factors, including, but not limited to, asset performance, interest rates and changes in actuarial assumptions. The Company estimates cash payments for postretirement health-care and life insurance benefit obligations to be $1.7 million in 2016 . Unrecognized tax benefits at January 31, 2016 of $10.2 million and accrued interest and penalties of $7.8 million. The final outcome of tax uncertainties is dependent upon various matters including tax examinations, interpretation of the applicable tax laws or expiration of statutes of limitations. The Company believes that its tax positions comply with applicable tax law and that it has adequately provided for these matters. However, the examinations may result in proposed assessments where the ultimate resolution may result in the Company owing additional taxes. At January 31, 2016 , approximately $9.1 million of total unrecognized tax benefits, if recognized, would affect the effective income tax rate. Management believes it is reasonably possible that a majority of the total gross amount provided for unrecognized tax benefits will decrease in the next 12 months. Future developments may result in a change in this assessment. The following is a summary of the Company's outstanding borrowings and available capacity under its credit facilities at January 31, 2016 : (in millions) Total Capacity Borrowings Outstanding Letters of Credit Issued Available Capacity Four-year revolving credit facility a $ 375.0 $ 22.1 $ $ 352.9 Five-year revolving credit facility b 375.0 54.5 5.6 314.9 Other credit facilities c 268.0 145.0 123.0 $ 1,018.0 $ 221.6 $ 5.6 $ 790.8 a Matures in October 2018. b Matures in October 2019. c Maturities throughout 2016. In addition, the Company has other available letters of credit and financial guarantees of $75.0 million of which $26.6 million was outstanding at January 31, 2016 . Of those available letters of credit and financial guarantees, $60.2 million expires within one year. Seasonality As a jeweler and specialty retailer, the Company's business is seasonal in nature, with the fourth quarter typically representing approximately one-third of annual net sales and a higher percentage of annual net earnings. Management expects such seasonality to continue. Critical Accounting Estimates The Company's consolidated financial statements have been prepared in accordance with accounting principles generally accepted in the United States of America. These principles require management to make certain estimates and assumptions that affect amounts reported and disclosed in the financial statements and related notes. Actual results could differ from those estimates and the differences could be material. Periodically, the Company reviews all significant estimates and assumptions affecting the financial statements and records any necessary adjustments. The development and selection of critical accounting estimates and the related disclosures below have been reviewed with the Audit Committee of the Company's Board of Directors. The following critical TIFFANY & CO. K- 49 Table of Contents accounting policies that rely on assumptions and estimates were used in the preparation of the Company's consolidated financial statements: Inventory. The Company writes down its inventory for discontinued and slow-moving products. This write-down is equal to the difference between the cost of inventory and its estimated market value, and is based on assumptions about future demand and market conditions. If actual market conditions are less favorable than those projected by management, additional inventory write-downs might be required. The Company has not made any material changes in the accounting methodology used to establish its reserve for discontinued and slow-moving products during the past three years. At January 31, 2016 , a 10% change in the reserve for discontinued and slow-moving products would have resulted in a change of $5.9 million in inventory and cost of sales. Property, plant and equipment and intangibles assets and key money . The Company reviews its property, plant and equipment and intangibles assets and key money for impairment when management determines that the carrying value of such assets may not be recoverable due to events or changes in circumstances. Recoverability of these assets is evaluated by comparing the carrying value of the asset with estimated future undiscounted cash flows. If the comparisons indicate that the value of the asset is not recoverable, an impairment loss is calculated as the difference between the carrying value and the fair value of the asset and the loss is recognized during that period. The Company did not record any material impairment charges in 2015 , 2014 or 2013 . Goodwill . The Company performs its annual impairment evaluation of goodwill during the fourth quarter of its fiscal year or when circumstances otherwise indicate an evaluation should be performed. A qualitative assessment is first performed for each reporting unit to determine whether it is more-likely-than-not that the fair value of the reporting unit is less than its carrying value. If it is concluded that this is the case, an evaluation, based upon discounted cash flows, is performed and requires management to estimate future cash flows, growth rates and economic and market conditions. The 2015 , 2014 and 2013 evaluations resulted in no impairment charges. Notes receivable and other financing arrangements. The Company has provided financing to diamond mining and exploration companies in order to obtain rights to purchase the mine's output. Management evaluates these financing arrangements for potential impairment by reviewing the parties' financial statements and projections along with business, operational and other economic factors on a periodic basis. If the analyses indicate that the financing receivable is not recoverable, an impairment loss is recognized, in respect to all or a portion of the financing, during that period. In 2015 , the Company recorded impairment charges totaling $37.9 million (see "Item 8. Financial Statements and Supplementary Data - Note B - Summary of Significant Accounting Policies and Note J - Commitments and Contingencies" for additional information). The Company did not record any material impairment charges in 2014 or 2013 . Income taxes . The Company is subject to income taxes in U.S. federal and state, as well as foreign jurisdictions. The calculation of the Company's tax liabilities involves dealing with uncertainties in the application of complex tax laws and regulations in a multitude of jurisdictions across the Company's global operations. Significant judgments and estimates are required in determining consolidated income tax expense. The Company's income tax expense, deferred tax assets and liabilities and reserves for uncertain tax positions reflect management's best assessment of estimated future taxes to be paid. Foreign and domestic tax authorities periodically audit the Company's income tax returns. These audits often examine and test the factual and legal basis for positions the Company has taken in its tax filings with respect to its tax liabilities, including the timing and amount of deductions and the allocation of income among various tax jurisdictions ("tax filing positions"). Management believes that its tax filing positions are reasonable and legally supportable. However, in specific cases, various tax authorities may take a contrary position. In evaluating the exposures associated with the Company's various tax filing TIFFANY & CO. K- 50 Table of Contents positions, management records reserves using a more-likely-than-not recognition threshold for income tax positions taken or expected to be taken. Earnings could be affected to the extent the Company prevails in matters for which reserves have been established or is required to pay amounts in excess of established reserves. At January 31, 2016 , total unrecognized tax benefits were $10.2 million of which approximately $9.1 million, if recognized, would affect the effective income tax rate. Management believes it is reasonably possible that a majority of the total gross amount provided for unrecognized tax benefits will decrease in the next 12 months. Future developments may result in a change in this assessment. In evaluating the Company's ability to recover its deferred tax assets within the jurisdiction from which they arise, management considers all available evidence. The Company records valuation allowances when management determines it is more likely than not that deferred tax assets will not be realized in the future. Employee benefit plans . The Company maintains several pension and retirement plans, as well as provides certain postretirement health-care and life insurance benefits for retired employees. The Company makes certain assumptions that affect the underlying estimates related to pension and other postretirement costs. Significant changes in interest rates, the market value of securities and projected health-care costs would require the Company to revise key assumptions and could result in a higher or lower charge to earnings. The Company used discount rates of 3.75% to determine 2015 expense for its U.S. Qualified Plan as well as its Excess Plan/SRIP and 3.50% for its postretirement plans. Holding all other assumptions constant, a 0.5% increase in the discount rates would have decreased 2015 pension and postretirement expenses by $7.9 million and $1.2 million. A decrease of 0.5% in the discount rates would have increased the 2015 pension and postretirement expenses by $8.9 million and $1.4 million. The discount rate is subject to change each year, consistent with changes in the yield on applicable high-quality, long-term corporate bonds. Management selects a discount rate at which pension and postretirement benefits could be effectively settled based on (i) an analysis of expected benefit payments attributable to current employment service and (ii) appropriate yields related to such cash flows. The Company used an expected long-term rate of return on pension plan assets of 7.50% to determine its 2015 pension expense. Holding all other assumptions constant, a 0.5% change in the long-term rate of return would have changed the 2015 pension expense by approximately $1.6 million. The expected long-term rate of return on pension plan assets is selected by taking into account the average rate of return expected on the funds invested or to be invested to provide for the benefits included in the projected benefit obligation. More specifically, consideration is given to the expected rates of return (including reinvestment asset return rates) based upon the plan's current asset mix, investment strategy and the historical performance of plan assets. For postretirement benefit measurement purposes, 7.25% annual rate of increase in the per capita cost of covered health care was assumed for 2016 . The rate was assumed to decrease gradually to 4.75% by 2023 and remain at that level thereafter. A one-percentage-point increase in the assumed health-care cost trend rate would increase the Company's accumulated postretirement benefit obligation by approximately $3.9 million for the year ended January 31, 2016 . Decreasing the assumed health-care cost trend rate by one-percentage point would decrease the Company's accumulated postretirement benefit obligation by approximately $2.8 million for the year ended January 31, 2016 . A one-percentage-point change in the assumed health-care cost trend rate would not have a significant effect on the Company's aggregate service and interest cost components of the 2015 postretirement expense. TIFFANY & CO. K- 51 Table of Contents 2016 Outlook For the fiscal year ending January 31, 2017, management is forecasting full year earnings per diluted share will range from unchanged to a mid-single-digit decline compared with 2015's $3.83 per diluted share (excluding the loan impairment and staffing and occupancy charges noted in "Non-GAAP Measures"). Based on sales trends in the current quarter-to-date and an assumption of gradual improvement over the course of the year, management expects that earnings per diluted share in the first quarter may decline by 15-20%, followed by a 5-10% decline in the second quarter and a resumption of growth in the second half. This forecast is based on the following assumptions, which are approximate and may or may not prove valid, and which should be read in conjunction with "Item 1A. Risk Factors" on page K-13: Worldwide net sales on a constant-exchange-rate basis increasing by a low-single-digit percentage, but approximately equal to the prior year when translated into U.S. dollars. Increasing worldwide gross retail square footage by 2%, net through 11 store openings, 6 relocations and 9 closings. Operating margin below the prior year 19.7% (excluding the prior year charges) due to an expected increase in gross margin but with SG&A expense growth (despite some benefit from lower pension costs) exceeding sales growth. Interest and other expenses, net unchanged from 2015. An effective income tax rate slightly lower than the prior year. Net inventories unchanged from the prior year. Capital expenditures of $260.0 million. Free cash flow of at least $400.0 million. NEW ACCOUNTING STANDARDS See "Item 8. Financial Statements and Supplementary Data - Note B - Summary of Significant Accounting Policies." OFF-BALANCE SHEET ARRANGEMENTS The Company does not have any off-balance sheet arrangements.
