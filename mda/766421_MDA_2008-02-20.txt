ITEM 7. MANAGEMENT S DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS OF FINANCIAL CONDITION AND RESULTS OF OPERATIONS OVERVIEW The following Management Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations (MD&A) is intended to help the reader understand the Company, our operations and our present business environment. MD&A is provided as a supplement to and should be read in conjunction with our consolidated financial statements and the accompanying notes. All statements in the following discussion that are not reports of historical information or descriptions of current accounting policy are forward-looking statements. Please consider our forward-looking statements in light of the risks referred to in this report introductory cautionary note and the risks mentioned in the Company filings with the Securities and Exchange Commission. This overview summarizes the MD&A, which includes the following sections: Year in Review highlights from 2007 outlining some of the major events that happened during the year and how they affected our financial performance. Results of Operations an in-depth analysis of the results of operations of Alaska and Horizon for the three years presented in our consolidated financial statements. We believe this analysis will help the reader better understand our consolidated statements of operations. Financial and statistical data for Alaska and Horizon are also included here. This section includes forward-looking statements regarding our view of 2008. Critical Accounting Estimates a discussion of our accounting estimates that involve significant judgment and uncertainties. Liquidity and Capital Resources an analysis of cash flows, sources and uses of cash, contractual obligations, commitments and off-balance sheet arrangements, an overview of financial position and the impact of inflation and changing prices. YEAR IN REVIEW In 2007, we reported consolidated net income of $125.0 million compared to a net loss of $52.6 million in 2006. The 2006 results included the following items that impact the comparability between the periods: We recorded $189.5 million ($118.5 million after tax) of fleet transition costs related to our MD-80 fleet. We also recorded a $24.8 million ($15.5 million after tax) restructuring charge associated with the voluntary severance package offered to certain of our employees represented by the International Association of Machinists and to our flight attendants as part of new four-year collective bargaining agreements. Both periods include adjustments to reflect the timing of gain or loss recognition resulting from mark-to-market fuel hedge accounting we recorded a $52.2 million gain in 2007 compared to an $89.9 million loss in 2006. The revenue environment in 2007 was characterized by increased competition in our primary markets and a softer demand environment in our West Coast market. However, yield at Alaska (which represents approximately 88% of consolidated revenues) improved slightly as we and other carriers attempted to raise fares to cover higher fuel costs. Both Alaska and Horizon posted higher passenger traffic. These factors resulted in an increase in total consolidated revenues of $171.6 million. Our total operating expenses declined by $127.7 million during 2007 compared to 2006. This decrease is primarily due to the 2006 fleet transition and restructuring charges mentioned above and mark-to-market gains associated with an increase in the value of our fuel hedge portfolio, offset by increases in other operating expenses in 2007. See Results of Operations below for further discussion of changes in revenues and operating expenses for both Alaska and Horizon. 28 Table of Contents Accomplishments Accomplishments from 2007 include: Alaska marked its 75 th anniversary with several celebration events and the unveiling of the Starliner 75, a new Boeing 737-800 aircraft painted in a vintage DC-3 livery. Horizon was named 2007 Regional Airline of the Year by Air Transport World. The publication cited, among other positive items, an exemplary safety record, superior commitment to customer service, and positive financial results during challenging industry times. In October 2007, we reached another website milestone by processing over 50% of our monthly sales through alaskaair.com for the first time. Alaska initiated service to the Hawaiian Islands in October 2007 something our customers and employees had been looking forward to for many years. Horizon also began non-stop service between Portland, Oregon and Santa Rosa, California. Alaska and Horizon have also initiated or announced additional service in certain existing markets or connected cities already served with new non-stop service. Common Stock Repurchase In September 2007, our Board of Directors authorized the Company to repurchase up to $100 million of our common stock over a period of twelve months. At December 31, 2007, we had repurchased 2.6 million shares of common stock for a total of $62.8 million. We believe this repurchase program enhances shareholder value and demonstrates our commitment to providing investors a return on capital employed in our business. The repurchased shares have been recorded as treasury shares in our consolidated balance sheet. Airport of the Future On October 16, 2007, we unveiled the first phase of our patented Airport of the Future at Seattle Tacoma International Airport. Once the project is complete, additional facilities are coming online in the first half of 2008, the Airport of the Future will allow both Alaska and Horizon customers to check in for their flights and drop bags more quickly, improve our agents productivity, and allow us to handle more customers without increasing our airport space. We debuted this concept at the Ted Stevens International Airport in Anchorage in 2004 and since that time, customer wait times have been reduced significantly. Row 44 In September 2007, Alaska announced its plan to launch in-flight wireless Internet service in 2008 based on Row 44, Inc. satellite-based broadband connectivity solution. We plan to test the system on Alaska aircraft in the first half of 2008. If the test is successful, we plan to equip all of our aircraft at Alaska with this equipment. This technology will provide customers with a unique entertainment and business network in the air. Passengers with Wi-Fi-enabled devices such as laptop computers, PDAs, smart phones and portable gaming systems will have high-speed access to the Internet, e-mail, virtual private networks and stored in-flight entertainment content. Hawaiian Vacations During the third quarter of 2007, Alaska announced the acquisition of certain assets of Hawaiian Vacations Inc., an Anchorage-based company that charters aircraft and markets package tours to the Hawaiian Islands. The acquisition of these assets will help accelerate our entrance into the Anchorage-Honolulu market, which began December 9, 2007 with one daily round trip. Q400 Landing Gear Inspections On September 12, 2007, Horizon temporarily grounded 19 of its 33 Bombardier Q400 turboprops as a precautionary measure following an all-operator message from Bombardier Aerospace of Canada. On September 13, in response to a Transport Canada airworthiness directive (AD), Horizon grounded its entire Q400 29 Table of Contents fleet to begin the required landing gear inspections. The AD was produced in the wake of two landing gear failure incidents involving Scandinavian Airlines (SAS) in Europe. Horizon, which has operated the Canadian-manufactured Q400 since 2001, has never experienced any issues like those encountered by SAS in these incidents. The inspections were completed over a 13-day period and the aircraft were put back into service after that time. Labor Costs and Negotiations We are pleased with the long-term contracts that have been reached with the majority of our labor groups. We are now in the process of negotiating new contracts with pilots at both Alaska and Horizon and with flight attendants at Horizon. The contract with Alaska pilots became amendable May 1, 2007, and the contract with Horizon pilots became amendable September 12, 2006. We hope to reach negotiated agreements with each of these groups that recognize the important contributions that they make to both of our airlines, without harming either company competitive position. Factoring in pay rates, productivity measures, pension, and post-retirement medical benefits, we believe our pilot unit costs are among the highest in the industry for the size of aircraft operated. We do not know what the final outcome of these negotiations will be or when agreements will be reached. However, uncertainty around open contracts could be a distraction to some employees, reduce employee engagement in our business, and hinder us from achieving the operational goals (such as on-time and completion-rate targets) that we have set. Alaska Fleet Transition During the first quarter of 2006, we announced our plan to retire our entire MD-80 fleet by the end of 2008 as part of Alaska move to an all-Boeing 737 fleet. We believe this transition, when completed, will provide more than $130 million in annual operating savings by way of lower fuel, maintenance, and training costs. During 2007, we sold all 20 of our owned operating MD-80s. The majority of these aircraft are now leased from the buyer under short-term lease arrangements, which will allow us to maintain our current MD-80 retirement schedule through December 2008. We ceased operation of seven of these leased MD-80s in 2007, including one at the end of December that was earlier than anticipated. The charge associated with the early retirement in December 2007 was not material. We currently have long-term lease arrangements on four MD-80 aircraft that we plan to cease operating before the end of the lease term. We anticipate that once these aircraft have been removed from operation, we will dispose of them through a lease buy-out or a sublease arrangement, or we will store them at a long-term storage facility. It is likely that we will record a charge in our statement of operations if either of these events occurs. Aggregate minimum lease payments for these four aircraft through the end of their lease terms total approximately $68.5 million as of December 31, 2007. Horizon Fleet Transition In 2006, Horizon entered into an agreement to sublease 16 of its Bombardier Q200 aircraft to a third party. During 2007, 11 aircraft were transferred, resulting in a loss on the sublease arrangement of $14.1 million that is reflected as Fleet transition costs Horizon in the consolidated statements of operations. We expect the average loss per aircraft to be approximately $1.4 million, which will be recorded as each aircraft leaves the fleet. In April 2007, Horizon announced an order for 15 additional Q400 aircraft, with options for 20 more. These aircraft will be delivered in 2008 and 2009. With this order, we plan to phase out the remaining leased Q200 aircraft by the end of 2009, and we are in the process of negotiating transactions that would allow for their exit from the fleet. We believe the market has improved since the earlier Q200 sublease transaction, but the amount or timing of any potential loss or gain cannot be reasonably estimated at this time. 30 Table of Contents In 2007, Horizon posted a pretax loss of $10.6 million. We have a number of initiatives underway to improve Horizon operating results, including evaluating whether further fleet simplification of Horizon fleet away from regional jets to an all-Q400 fleet would be beneficial. However, no decisions have been made at this time. Capacity Purchase Agreements Alaska and Horizon entered into a Capacity Purchase Agreement (CPA) effective January 1, 2007, whereby Alaska purchases capacity on certain routes ( capacity purchase markets ) from Horizon as specified by the agreement. This agreement has resulted in a new presentation in Alaska statement of operations. The actual passenger revenue from the capacity purchase markets is identified as Passenger revenue purchased capacity and the associated costs are identified as Purchased capacity costs. Alaska also has a similar arrangement in place with a third-party carrier for flying between Anchorage and Dutch Harbor, Alaska. Historically, the revenue from this arrangement was presented in Other revenue net and the associated costs were in Contracted services in Alaska statement of operations. Now, all of these revenues and costs are presented with the Horizon purchased capacity revenues and costs, and the prior period has been reclassified to conform to the current presentation. Alaska and Horizon entered into the CPA in order to improve the visibility of both the revenues and the costs of flying in the capacity purchase markets. Under the CPA, Alaska pays Horizon a contractual amount for the purchased capacity in the incentive markets regardless of the revenue collected on those flights. The amount paid to Horizon is generally based on Horizon operating costs plus a margin. Alaska bears the inventory and revenue risk in those markets. Accordingly, Alaska records the related passenger revenue. Alaska records payments to Horizon in Purchased capacity costs. Horizon records the payment from Alaska as Passenger revenue. The Air Group planning department works to strategically deploy certain Horizon aircraft by optimizing the balance of local and flow traffic connections with Alaska in order to maximize total returns to the Company and to allow Alaska to deploy its larger jets to other routes. Prior to 2007, there was a revenue-sharing arrangement in place whereby Alaska made a payment to Horizon if certain covered markets created losses for Horizon. Alternatively, Horizon made a payment to Alaska if those markets were profitable. Under both the revenue-sharing arrangement that was previously in place and the new CPA, the payments made from Alaska to Horizon are eliminated in consolidation and do not impact Air Group consolidated results. Frontier JetExpress In November 2007, Horizon discontinued its contract flying with Frontier Airlines as Frontier JetExpress. We had nine CRJ-700 aircraft dedicated to this program, all of which have returned to Horizon operating fleet. Two of these aircraft were returned in the first quarter, one in the third quarter and the remaining six in the fourth quarter of 2007. We have used these aircraft for productive and strategic redeployments throughout Horizon network and in capacity purchase markets with Alaska. However, the influx of new capacity has depressed yields in some of our markets. Line of Credit Modification In April 2007, we announced the Second Amendment of the March 25, 2005, $160 million variable-rate credit facility with a syndicate of financial institutions. The terms of the Second Amendment provide that any borrowings will be secured by either aircraft or cash collateral. The Second Amendment: (i) increased the size of the facility to $185 million; (ii) improved the collateral advance rates for certain aircraft; (iii) extended the agreement by two years with a maturity date of March 31, 2010; and (iv) repriced the credit facility to reflect current market rates. We currently have no immediate plans to borrow using this credit facility. In July 2007, we executed the Third Amendment to the credit facility, which amended a covenant restriction to allow borrowings between Alaska Airlines and its affiliates of up to $500 million, from $300 million previously. 31 Table of Contents Outlook We currently expect to increase Alaska mainline capacity by 3% and reduce Horizon total system capacity by 4% in 2008 compared to 2007. The expected capacity increase at Alaska is due primarily to the anticipated delivery of 17 new B737-800 aircraft in 2008 and the annualization of capacity additions that resulted from 14 B737-800 aircraft delivered in 2007, offset by the retirement of 15 MD-80 aircraft and, to a lesser extent, scheduled retirement of other aircraft. We will continue to monitor our flight schedules to see if there are further opportunities to reduce unprofitable flying and perhaps retire some of our MD-80s sooner than currently planned. We recently announced that we will be eliminating our Oakland Orange County route and Alaska will shift to Horizon its daily flights from Seattle to Reno and Boise in an effort to reduce costs and increase profitability. On a net basis, we expect that Alaska fleet size will grow by one aircraft in 2008 (from 115 to 116), although the B737-800 aircraft are larger than the MD-80s, allowing for the capacity growth mentioned above. Horizon expected capacity decrease is due largely to the anticipated reduction of several Q200 aircraft and the retirement of one CRJ700, offset by the delivery of four new Q400 aircraft in 2008 and the annualization of 13 new Q400 aircraft delivered in 2007. Additionally, there has been an increase in the number of seats on a portion of the fleet of Q400s from 74 seats to 76 seats (all Q400 aircraft will have 76 seats by the end of 2008). The aircraft deliveries in 2008 at both Alaska and Horizon are planned to replace outgoing aircraft, increase frequency in our existing markets and, to a lesser degree, serve new markets. For much of the past three years, Alaska operational performance has fallen short of our goals and our customers expectations. We currently have several initiatives underway to help improve our on-time performance, completion rates, baggage handling, and other important customer-driven operational measures. Delivering on these core operational promises is one of our highest-priority internal goals for 2008. RESULTS OF OPERATIONS 2007 COMPARED WITH 2006 Our consolidated net income for 2007 was $125.0 million, or $3.09 per diluted share, compared to a net loss of $52.6 million, or $1.39 per diluted share, in 2006. Several items, as noted below, affect the comparability between the two periods: During 2006, we recorded fleet transition costs of $189.5 million ($118.5 million after tax, or $3.12 per share) associated with our fleet transition plan. See Note 2 to the consolidated financial statements. In 2006, we recognized restructuring charges of $24.8 million ($15.5 million after tax, or $0.41 per share) associated with an offer of voluntary severance to certain of Alaska employees represented by the IAM and the AFA. Both periods include adjustments to reflect the timing of gain or loss recognition resulting from mark-to-market fuel hedge accounting. In 2007, we recognized mark-to-market gains of $52.2 million ($32.7 million after tax, or $0.81 per diluted share), compared to a loss of $89.9 million ($56.3 million after tax, or $1.48 per share) in 2006. We believe disclosure of the impact of these individual charges is useful information to investors and other readers because: it is useful to monitor performance without these items as it improves a reader ability to compare our results to other airlines; 32 Table of Contents our results excluding these special items is the basis for our various employee incentive plans, thus allowing investors to better understand the changes in variable incentive pay expense in our consolidated statements of operations; our results excluding these items is most often used in internal management and board reporting and decision-making; and we believe it is the basis by which we are evaluated by industry analysts. Our consolidated results are primarily driven by the results of our two operating carriers. Alaska reported pretax income of $216.0 million in 2007, while Horizon reported a pretax loss of $10.6 million in 2007. Financial and statistical data for Alaska and Horizon are shown on pages 34 and 35, respectively. An in-depth discussion of the results of Alaska and Horizon begins on page 36. 33 Table of Contents ALASKA AIRLINES FINANCIAL AND STATISTICAL DATA Quarter Ended December 31 Year Ended December 31 2007

See page 43 for additional line of business information. 35 Table of Contents ALASKA AIRLINES Alaska reported income before income taxes of $216.0 million during 2007 compared to a loss before income taxes of $92.2 million in 2006. The $308.2 million difference between the periods is primarily the result of the fleet transition and restructuring charges recognized in 2006 totaling $214.3 million, combined with a reduction in fuel expense following mark-to-market fuel-hedging losses recorded in 2006 as compared to mark-to-market fuel- hedging gains in the current year. These mark-to-market adjustments are a result of changes in the value of our fuel hedge portfolio driven by changes in the price of crude oil. The year most important trend was the dramatic increase in raw and economic fuel costs and the commensurate increase in passenger revenue as we (and many of our competitors) attempted to pass along the increased fuel costs. See page 39 for a discussion of raw and economic fuel costs. ALASKA REVENUES Total operating revenues increased $377.4 million, or 14.0%, in 2007 as compared to 2006. The new Capacity Purchase Agreement with Horizon described above made up $265.0 million of the increase, with mainline revenues (defined as passenger revenues from those flights operating on Alaska Airlines jets plus freight, mail and other revenues) contributing $112.4 million of the increase. The components of Alaska revenue are summarized in the following table: Years Ended December 31 (in millions) 2007 2006 % Change Passenger Revenue mainline $ 2,547.2 $ 2,453.1 3.8 Freight and mail 94.2 93.4 0.9 Other net 147.1 129.6 13.5 Total Mainline Revenues $ 2,788.5 $ 2,676.1 4.2 Passenger Revenue purchased capacity 281.4 16.4 NM Total Operating Revenues $ 3,069.9 $ 2,692.5 14.0 NM = Not Meaningful 36 Table of Contents Operating Revenue Mainline Mainline passenger revenue increased 3.8% on a 4.0% increase in available seat miles offset by a modest decline in mainline passenger revenue per available seat mile (PRASM). The slight decline in PRASM was the result of a 0.3% increase in yields, offset by a 0.4-point decline in load factor compared to 2006. Although the load factor for the full year was down from 2006, load factors outpaced 2006 in the second half of the year after lagging 2006 in the first half of the year. These load factor improvements contributed to the increase in unit passenger revenue (PRASM) seen in the third and fourth quarters. We believe the full-year load factor decline is due to capacity growth in connection with the replacement of older aircraft with larger B737-800 aircraft without a commensurate increase in the number of passengers. Our advance bookings currently suggest that load factors will be up 2 to 3 points in the first quarter of 2008 compared to the same period in 2007. Freight and mail revenue was flat compared to 2006. This is primarily due to a decline in freight and mail volumes resulting from lower capacity that stemmed from the delay in the conversion of four of our B737-400 passenger aircraft to combi aircraft, offset by an increase in cargo yields, including those coming through fuel surcharges. We currently anticipate an increase in freight and mail revenues in 2008 as we expect to deploy our full capacity for the entire year. Other net revenues increased $17.5 million, or 13.5%, primarily as a result of higher commission revenue associated with the sale of mileage credits to our bank partner. When we sell mileage credits, we defer the majority of the proceeds and recognize that revenue when award travel takes place. Commission revenue represents the difference between the proceeds from the sale of miles and the amount we defer. Passenger Revenue Purchased Capacity Passenger revenue purchased capacity increased by $265.0 million to $281.4 million because of the CPA with Horizon. Although the markets subject to the CPA have changed slightly compared to those included under the prior revenue-sharing arrangement, we believe it is useful to evaluate year-over-year revenue information to gauge actual trends in those markets. This factors out the impact of the intercompany capacity purchase agreement and, as a result, gives readers information about the aggregate impact to Air Group revenues. In 2006, Horizon recorded $221.5 million in revenues for markets covered by the prior revenue- sharing arrangement. Yields in those markets declined 3.3% and load factor increased 1.5 points on a 29.7% increase in capacity. 37 Table of Contents During 2007, purchased capacity costs exceeded passenger revenue purchased capacity by $21.4 million. However, the reported results of purchased capacity flying do not reflect the total contribution of these flights to our mainline operation as many of the flights feed traffic from smaller cities. ALASKA EXPENSES For the year, total operating expenses increased $66.4 million compared to 2006 as a result of new purchased capacity costs recorded under the CPA with Horizon, offset by a decline in mainline operating costs. The components of Alaska operating expenses are summarized in the following table: Years Ended December 31 Operating Expenses (in millions) 2007 2006 % Change Mainline operating expenses $ 2,552.3 $ 2,774.4 (8.0 ) Purchased capacity costs 302.8 14.3 NM Total Operating Expenses $ 2,855.1 $ 2,788.7 2.4 NM = Not meaningful Mainline Operating Expenses Total mainline operating costs for 2007 declined by $222.1 million or 8.0% compared to 2006. The absence of the fleet transition costs and restructuring charges in 2007, and lower aircraft fuel expense resulting from mark-to-market gains associated with the value of our fuel hedge portfolio were the primary causes of the decline. Along with our financial and statistical data on page 34, we are presenting here our line-item expenses on a per-ASM basis (in cents). We believe this information is useful to investors because it highlights areas in which costs have increased or decreased either more or less than capacity: Years Ended December 31, CASM Change 2007 2006 2005 2007 vs. 2006 2006 vs. 2005 Wages and benefits 3.11 3.19 3.24 (0.08 ) (0.05 ) Variable incentive pay 0.06 0.12 0.07 (0.06 ) 0.05 Aircraft fuel, including hedging gains and losses 3.04 3.25 2.13 (0.21 ) 1.12 Aircraft maintenance 0.62 0.67 0.83 (0.05 ) (0.16 ) Aircraft rent 0.47 0.48 0.52 (0.01 ) (0.04 ) Landing fees and other rentals 0.70 0.68 0.70 0.02 (0.02 ) Contracted services 0.51 0.51 0.47 0.04 Selling expenses 0.53 0.61 0.59 (0.08 ) 0.02 Depreciation and amortization 0.59 0.59 0.56 0.03 Food and beverage service 0.19 0.21 0.22 (0.02 ) (0.01 ) Other 0.72 0.69 0.72 0.03 (0.03 ) Fleet transition costs 0.81 (0.81 ) 0.81 Restructuring charges and adjustments 0.11 0.09 (0.11 ) 0.02 Total Mainline Operating Expenses per ASM 10.54 11.92 10.14 (1.37 ) 1.78 Additional line item information is provided below. Wages and Benefits Wages and benefits were relatively flat in 2007, primarily as a result of the following: a 3.8% increase in full-time equivalents. The number of full-time equivalent employees increased largely as a result of our initiative to improve our on-time performance and other operational goals; 38 Table of Contents an increase in the number of flight attendants as we transition to B737-800s, which have four flight attendants, compared to three in the MD-80 aircraft that are being replaced; and normal step, scale and market-based wage increases. These increases were offset by the following: 2006 included a $2.7 million contract-signing bonus paid to our flight attendants and a $1.9 million contract-signing bonus paid to our clerical, office and passenger service employees and our ramp service and stores agents; and a reduction of $15.6 million in expenses associated with our defined-benefit plans as more of our employees transition over to an enhanced defined-contribution plan, offset by a $1.2 million increase in defined-contribution plan expense. We currently expect wages and benefits to increase slightly in 2008 but decline on a per-ASM basis. This expectation is exclusive of any potential change in pilot wages that may result from our current contract negotiations. Variable Incentive Pay Variable incentive pay for 2007 decreased $14.2 million or 51.3%, compared to 2006. The decrease results from lower annual expense under the various Air Group profit-based incentive plans as our profitability was lower than originally expected, offset by higher expenses associated with our Operational Performance Rewards plan. For purposes of our incentive pay plans, profit is generally defined as results excluding fleet transition costs, restructuring charges, and other amounts specified in the various incentive plan documents and with fuel stated on an economic basis. Air Group maintains several incentive plans that collectively cover all of our employees and create alignment for employees, customers and shareholders. These plans include both operational and financial performance metrics that, to a large extent, are based on certain annual financial targets. Aircraft Fuel Aircraft fuel expense includes both raw fuel expense (as defined below) plus the effect of mark-to-market adjustments to our fuel hedge portfolio that we include in our income statement as the value of the portfolio increases and decreases. By definition, our aircraft fuel expense is very volatile, even between quarters, because it includes these gains or losses when the underlying instrument increases or decreases in value as crude oil prices increase or decrease. Raw fuel expense is defined as the price that we generally pay at the airport, or the into-plane price, including taxes. Raw fuel prices are impacted by world oil prices and refining costs, which can vary by region in the U.S. Raw fuel expense approximates cash paid to suppliers. Aircraft fuel expense decreased $19.5 million, or 2.6%, compared to 2006. The elements of the change are illustrated in the following table: Years Ended December 31 (in millions, except per-gallon amounts) 2007 2006 % Change Fuel gallons consumed 354.3 354.3 0.0 Raw price per gallon $ 2.33 $ 2.16 7.9 Total raw fuel expense $ 825.7 $ 765.6 7.9 Impact on fuel expense from changes in value of the fuel hedge portfolio (gain) (88.2 ) (8.6 ) NM Aircraft fuel expense $ 737.5 $ 757.0 (2.6 ) NM = Not meaningful Fuel gallons consumed were flat on a 4.0% increase in capacity because of the improved fuel efficiency of our fleet as we transition out of the less-efficient MD-80 aircraft to newer, more-efficient B737-800 aircraft. The raw fuel price per gallon increased by 7.9% as a result of higher West Coast jet fuel prices driven by higher crude oil costs. During 2007, we recorded mark-to-market gains reflecting an increase in the value of our fuel hedge portfolio between December 31, 2006 and December 31, 2007. In 2006, we recorded a mark-to-market loss, as oil prices on 39 Table of Contents December 31, 2006 were lower than they were a year earlier. Our hedge portfolio consists primarily of call options that are based on the prices of crude oil. We also evaluate economic fuel expense , which we define as raw fuel expense less the cash we receive from hedge counterparties for hedges that settle during the period, offset by the premium expense that we recognize. A key difference between aircraft fuel expense and economic fuel expense is the timing of gain or loss recognition. When we refer to economic fuel expense , we include gains only when they are realized through a cash receipt from our hedge contract counterparties. We believe this is the best measure of the effect that fuel prices are currently having on our business because it most closely approximates the net cash outflow associated with purchasing fuel for our operation. Accordingly, many industry analysts evaluate our results using this measure, and it is the basis for most internal management reporting and incentive pay plans. Our economic fuel expense is calculated as follows: Years Ended December 31 (in millions, except per-gallon amounts) 2007 2006 % Change Raw fuel expense $ 825.7 $ 765.6 7.9 Less: cash received from settled hedges (44.9 ) (87.0 ) NM Economic fuel expense $ 780.8 $ 678.6 15.1 Fuel gallons consumed 354.3 354.3 0.0 Economic fuel cost per gallon $ 2.20 $ 1.92 14.6 NM = Not meaningful In 2005 and 2006, we realized significant benefits from in-the-money fuel hedge contracts. However, our fuel hedge protection declined substantially in 2007 as the strike price of our hedges was closer to current oil prices compared to those in place during the previous two years. The total cash benefit from hedges that settled during the period declined to $44.9 million in 2007 down from $87.0 million in 2006 and $108.8 million in 2005. We currently expect economic fuel expense to be higher in 2008 than in 2007 because of high crude oil prices. For example, if oil were to average $87 per barrel in 2008, we would expect our raw fuel expense to be approximately $2.67 per gallon and the cash benefit of settled hedges to be approximately $55 million, resulting in an economic fuel price per gallon of approximately $2.52. Aircraft Maintenance Aircraft maintenance declined by $7.0 million, or 4.5%, compared to the prior year largely as a result of the benefits of our fleet transition as we replace our aging MD-80s and B737-200C aircraft with newer B737-800 and converted B737-400 aircraft, respectively. We currently expect maintenance expense to increase slightly in 2008 because of the timing of certain required maintenance events, offset by additional benefits to be realized from the fleet transition. Aircraft Rent Aircraft rent increased by $1.9 million, or 1.7%, because of the sale and short-term leaseback of substantially all of our owned MD-80 aircraft during the second quarter of 2007 and the addition of two new leased B737-800 aircraft in the fourth quarter of 2006, partially offset by the buyout of five leased MD-80 aircraft in the third quarter of 2006. We expect a year-over-year increase in aircraft rent in 2008 as we lease an additional B737-800, offset by the retirement of the MD-80s. Landing Fees and Other Rentals Landing fees and other rentals increased by $11.9 million, or 7.5%, compared to 2006 as a result of higher costs at Seattle-Tacoma International and other airports. We expect year-over-year increases in 2008 as a result of fees in our new Hawaii stations and for the continuing transition to 737-800 aircraft that are larger than the outgoing MD-80 aircraft. Selling Expenses Selling expenses declined by $12.2 million, or 8.6%, compared to 2006 as a result of lower 40 Table of Contents ticket distribution costs and credit card fees that resulted from new contracts that were put into place in the fourth quarter of 2006. The 2006 amount also included $3.7 million paid to Horizon under the revenue-sharing arrangement in certain designated markets that existed in 2006, compared to zero in the current year because of the new CPA. These declines were partially offset by higher advertising costs. We currently expect that selling expenses will decline slightly in 2008 as we continue to focus our efforts on shifting sales to our web sites, which reduces the commission we pay to outside providers. Depreciation and Amortization Depreciation and amortization increased $4.5 million, or 3.3%, compared to 2006. This is primarily the result of 10 new B737-800 aircraft delivered in 2006 and 14 in 2007, partially offset by the sale and leaseback of 20 MD-80s in 2007. We expect depreciation and amortization to increase by about 14% in 2008 as we acquire more new B737-800 aircraft. Other Operating Expenses Other operating expenses increased because of higher passenger remuneration costs, crew costs, professional fees, software license and maintenance costs, higher property taxes, and other costs, offset by lower liability insurance expense because of better rates negotiated in December 2006. Mainline Operating Costs per Available Seat Mile (CASM) Operating costs per ASM (CASM) is an important metric in the industry, and we use it to gauge the effectiveness of our cost-reduction efforts. Our effort to reduce unit costs focuses not only on controlling the actual dollars we spend, but also on increasing our capacity without adding a commensurate amount of cost. Our mainline operating costs per mainline ASM are summarized below: Years Ended December 31 2007 2006 %Change Total mainline operating expenses per ASM (CASM) 10.54 11.92 (11.6 ) CASM includes the following components: Fuel costs per ASM 3.04 3.25 (6.4 ) Fleet transition costs per ASM 0.81 NM Restructuring charges per ASM 0.11 NM NM = Not meaningful We have separately listed in the above table our fuels costs per ASM, fleet transition costs per ASM and restructuring charges per ASM. These amounts are included in CASM, but for internal purposes we consistently use unit cost metrics that exclude these items to measure our cost-reduction progress. We do so, and believe that such analysis may be important to investors and other readers of these financial statements for the following reasons: Mainline cost per ASM excluding fuel is one of the most important measures used by managements of both Alaska and Horizon and the Air Group Board of Directors in assessing quarterly and annual cost performance. For Alaska Airlines, these decision-makers evaluate operating results of the mainline operation, which includes the operation of the B737 and MD-80 aircraft fleets branded in Alaska Airlines livery. The revenues and expenses associated with purchased capacity are evaluated separately. Mainline cost per ASM excluding fuel (and other items as specified in our governing documents) is an important metric for the employee incentive plan that covers company management and executives. By eliminating fuel expense from our unit cost metrics, we believe that we have better visibility into the results of our 41 Table of Contents non-fuel cost-reduction initiatives. Our industry is highly competitive and is characterized by high fixed costs, so even a small reduction in non-fuel operating costs can result in a significant improvement in operating results. In addition, we believe that all domestic carriers are similarly impacted by changes in jet fuel costs over the long run, so it is important for management (and thus investors) to understand the impact of (and trends in) company-specific cost drivers such as labor rates and productivity, airport costs, maintenance costs, etc., which are more controllable by management. Mainline cost per ASM excluding fuel is a measure commonly used by industry analysts, and we believe it is the basis by which they compare our airlines to others in the industry. The measure is also the subject of frequent questions from holders of our common stock. Disclosure of the individual impact of certain noted items provides investors the ability to measure and monitor performance both with and without these special items. We believe that disclosing the impact of items such as the fleet transition costs and restructuring charges is important because it provides information on significant items that are not necessarily indicative of future performance. Industry analysts and investors consistently measure the Company performance without these items for better comparability between periods and among other airlines. Although we disclose our mainline passenger unit revenues for Alaska, we do not (nor are we able to) evaluate mainline unit revenues excluding the impact that rising fuel costs have had on ticket prices. Fuel represents nearly 30% of our total mainline operating expenses, and fluctuations in our fuel prices often drive changes in unit revenues in the mid-to-long term. Although we believe it is useful to evaluate non-fuel unit costs for the reasons noted above, we would caution readers of these financial statements not to place undue reliance on unit costs excluding fuel as a measure or predictor of future profitability because of the significant impact of fuel costs on our business. Our mainline unit costs excluding fuel and other special items for the first quarter and full year 2008 are expected to remain flat from similar measures in 2007. Our primary goal in 2008 is to improve our operational reliability, including our on-time performance, completion of scheduled flights, and baggage delivery metrics, with a special focus on our Seattle operations. Purchased Capacity Costs Purchased capacity costs increased $288.5 million, from $14.3 million in 2006 to $302.8 million in 2007. Of the total, $283.4 million was paid to Horizon under the new CPA for 1.4 billion ASMs. The balance includes amounts paid to a third party for the Dutch Harbor flying (which approximates the amount paid in 2006) and certain administrative and information technology costs borne by Alaska that are allocated to purchased capacity flying costs. In the aggregate, costs of purchased capacity exceeded revenues in these markets by $21.4 million. The markets covered by the CPA with Horizon are both flow markets that provide connecting traffic to Alaska and local markets where Horizon regional jets are used to maximize returns (or minimize losses) to Air Group and allow Alaska to deploy its larger jets to other routes. Generally speaking, revenues in the flow markets exceed costs. However, revenue in most of the local markets falls short of costs. With high fuel prices and relatively high non-fuel costs, some of these routes operated by Horizon are unprofitable with CRJ-700s and are too small to support 737 service. We are evaluating alternatives to improve the results of these routes. Alternatives include reducing the size of the CRJ-700 fleet, moving some of the flying to the Q400, and having a portion of the capacity in these markets performed by a third party with larger, more efficient aircraft. 42 Table of Contents HORIZON AIR Horizon reported a loss before income taxes of $10.6 million during 2007 compared to income before income taxes of $11.7 million in 2006. The $22.3 million decrease is primarily due to higher operating costs, including higher fuel costs and fleet transition costs of $14.1 million, partially offset by higher operating revenues. There were several significant events in 2007 that impacted Horizon financial results, including charges associated with the transition of the Q200 fleet, a significant increase in maintenance costs related to scheduled engine overhauls, and the integration of the nine regional jets from Frontier JetExpress into the Horizon network. The extra capacity from the Frontier JetExpress operations proved harder to integrate than was originally planned because of a softer revenue environment and unexpected competition in some of our markets. Despite the dramatic increase in capacity, load factor declined only 0.7 points. However, the stable load factor came at the expense of yield on flying done under Horizon own brand, which declined 5.9%. In addition to assimilating the capacity from the Frontier JetExpress flying, Horizon also absorbed the operating costs for the returning jets, including fuel costs, which were previously the responsibility of Frontier. HORIZON REVENUES In 2007, operating revenues increased $74.4 million, or 11.6%, compared to 2006. Horizon passenger revenues are summarized in the table below: Revenues (in millions) and % of ASMs Years Ended December 31 2007 2006 Revenues %ASMs Revenues %ASMs Passenger revenue from Horizon brand flying $ 391.3 52 $ 359.1 48 Revenue from CPA with Alaska 283.4 35 n/a n/a Passenger revenue Alaska revenue share markets n/a n/a 221.5 29 Revenue from CPA with Frontier JetExpress 34.5 13 52.5 23 Total Passenger Revenue and % of ASMs $ 709.2 100 % $ 633.1 100 % Horizon system-wide operating revenues per ASM increased by 1.9% from 2006. The increase was largely due to the shift in capacity out of Frontier JetExpress flying (which produced relatively low RASM because of the terms of the contract and the longer-haul nature of the flying) to higher RASM brand and Alaska CPA flying. As mentioned earlier, the Frontier JetExpress operation ceased in November 2007. Line-of-business information is presented in the table below. In both CPA arrangements, Horizon is insulated from market revenue factors and is guaranteed contractual revenue amounts based on operational capacity. As a result, yield and load factor information for the CPA arrangements are not presented.

Horizon has the inventory and revenue risk in these markets. Passenger revenue from Horizon brand flying increased $32.2 million, or 9.0%, on a 19.6% increase in brand capacity offset by an 8.8% decline in unit revenues. The decline in unit revenues was due to a 2.4-point reduction in load factor, along with a 5.9% decline in yields, resulting from increased competition in many of these brand markets and from intentional pricing actions taken in certain markets to fill the additional capacity. Revenue from the CPA with Alaska totaled $283.4 million during 2007. Under the CPA, the fee paid by Alaska is based on Horizon actual operating costs plus a specified margin. Under the prior revenue-sharing arrangement, Alaska made a payment to Horizon equal to Horizon loss in those markets, if any, and a quarterly bonus that was based on Alaska overall operating margin. Alternatively, Horizon made a payment to Alaska if those markets were profitable. Revenue from the Frontier JetExpress flying declined 34.3% from $52.5 million in 2006 to $34.5 million in 2007 on a 38.1% decline in ASMs. The ASM decline is consistent with the wind-down of the JetExpress arrangement that occurred throughout 2007. HORIZON EXPENSES Total operating expenses increased $87.1 million, or 13.8%, as compared to 2006. Along with our financial and statistical data on page 35, we are presenting here our line item expenses on a per-ASM basis (in cents): Years Ended December 31, CASM Change 2007 2006 2005 2007 vs. 2006 2006 vs. 2005 Wages and benefits 5.06 5.21 5.11 (0.15 ) 0.10 Variable incentive pay 0.18 0.25 0.14 (0.07 ) 0.11 Aircraft fuel, including hedging gains and losses 3.49 3.21 2.14 0.28 1.07 Aircraft maintenance 2.31 2.03 1.27 0.28 0.76 Aircraft rent 1.65 1.91 2.07 (0.26 ) (0.16 ) Landing fees and other rentals 1.43 1.29 1.40 0.14 (0.11 ) Contracted services 0.68 0.74 0.70 (0.06 ) 0.04 Selling expenses 0.79 0.87 0.86 (0.08 ) 0.01 Depreciation and amortization 0.85 0.51 0.49 0.34 0.02 Food and beverage service 0.07 0.08 0.07 (0.01 ) 0.01 Other 1.21 1.30 1.24 (0.09 ) 0.06 Fleet transition costs 0.35 0.35 Total Operating Expenses per ASM 18.07 17.40 15.49 0.67 1.91 44 Table of Contents Significant period-over-period changes in the components of operating expenses are as follows: Wages and Benefits Wages and benefits increased $11.9 million, or 6.3%, as a result of a slight increase in full-time equivalent employees, higher wages due to market and step increases, and an increase in our group medical costs. We expect that wages and benefits will be flat in 2008 compared to 2007. Aircraft Fuel Aircraft fuel expense increased $22.3 million, or 19.1%, compared to 2006. The elements of the change are illustrated in the following table: Years Ended December 31 (in millions, except per-gallon amounts) 2007 2006 % Change Fuel gallons consumed 64.8 54.3 19.3 Raw price per gallon $ 2.41 $ 2.19 10.0 Total raw fuel expense $ 156.2 $ 119.1 31.2 Impact on fuel expense from changes in value of the fuel hedge portfolio (gain) (17.4 ) (2.6 ) NM Aircraft fuel expense $ 138.8 $ 116.5 19.1 NM = Not meaningful The 19.3% increase in consumption was driven by the return of all nine CRJ-700s from Frontier JetExpress and the introduction of several new Q400s into the fleet, replacing smaller Q200s. Under the Frontier JetExpress arrangement, fuel was purchased by Frontier. We expect to see a year-over-year increase in the number of gallons consumed in 2008 as we see the full effect of the fleet changes. Offsetting these increases in fuel consumption is the improved fuel efficiency of our fleet resulting from new Q400 aircraft deliveries. These more fuel-efficient aircraft have helped to improve the overall fuel-burn rate per ASM by approximately 3% from 2006. The raw fuel price per gallon increased by 10% as a result of higher West Coast jet fuel prices driven by higher crude oil costs. During 2007, we recorded mark-to-market gains reflecting an increase in the value of our fuel hedge portfolio between December 31, 2006 and December 31, 2007. In 2006, we recorded a mark-to-market loss, as oil prices on December 31, 2006 were lower than they were a year earlier. Our hedge portfolio consists primarily of call options that are based on the price of crude oil. We realized gains of $8.5 million from settled hedge contracts in 2007, compared to $14.1 million in 2006. Our economic fuel expense is calculated as follows: Years Ended December 31 (in millions, except per-gallon amounts) 2007 2006 % Change Raw fuel expense $ 156.2 $ 119.1 31.2 Less: cash received from settled hedges (8.5 ) (14.1 ) NM Economic fuel expense $ 147.7 $ 105.0 40.7 Fuel gallons consumed 64.8 54.3 19.3 Economic fuel cost per gallon $ 2.28 $ 1.93 18.1 NM = Not meaningful Like Alaska, our fuel hedge protection declined substantially in 2007 as the strike price of our hedges was closer to current oil prices compared to those in place during the previous two years. The total cash benefit from hedges that settled during the period declined to $8.5 million in 2007 from $14.1 million in 2006 and $16.2 million in 2005. We currently expect economic fuel expense to be higher in 2008 than in 2007 because of high crude oil prices. For example, if oil were to average $87 per barrel in 2008, we would expect our raw fuel expense to be approximately $2.72 per gallon and the cash benefit of settled hedges to be approximately $10 million, resulting in an economic fuel price per gallon of approximately $2.59. 45 Table of Contents Aircraft Maintenance Aircraft maintenance expense increased $18.1 million, or 24.5%, primarily as a result of a higher number of engine events, including scheduled events on our CRJ-700 engines. We expect maintenance expense in 2008 to be approximately $15 million lower than in 2007, primarily because of fewer CRJ-700 engine events. However, actual results could differ materially if the maintenance schedule is modified or we are forced to perform unforeseen maintenance activities. Aircraft Rent Aircraft rent declined by $3.7 million, or 5.3%, primarily as a result of the reduction in the number of leased Q200 aircraft in our operating fleet. These leased aircraft were replaced with new, owned Q400s during the year. Depreciation and Amortization Depreciation and amortization increased $15.4 million, or 83.2%, as a result of the 13 new Q400s that were delivered in 2007. We own all of these new aircraft. Additionally, we recorded higher depreciation expense on Q200 rotable and repairable parts since we now intend to phase out those aircraft by the end of 2009. We anticipate that depreciation and amortization expense will continue to increase in 2008 as we take more Q400 deliveries throughout the year. Fleet Transition Costs Fleet transition costs associated with the sublease of Q200 aircraft were $14.1 million in 2007 as a result of the 11 Q200 aircraft that were delivered to a third party. We expect total fleet transition costs to be approximately $8 million during 2008 as five additional Q200s leave the fleet and we record losses arising from the subleases. Operating Costs per Available Seat Mile (CASM) As discussed above, operating costs per ASM (CASM) is an important metric in the industry and we use it to gauge the effectiveness of our cost- reduction efforts. Like Alaska s, Horizon efforts to reduce unit costs over the long term focus not only on controlling the actual dollars we spend, but also on increasing available seat miles without adding a commensurate amount of cost. We intend to increase capacity in the future primarily through larger-gauge aircraft as we replace our Q200 aircraft with larger Q400 aircraft. However, we expect a reduction of capacity in 2008 as noted previously, which puts upward pressure on our unit costs. Our operating costs per ASM are summarized below: Years Ended December 31 2007 2006 % Change Total operating expenses per ASM (CASM) 18.07 17.40 3.9 CASM includes the following components: Fuel costs per ASM 3.49 3.21 8.8 Fleet transition costs per ASM 0.35 NM NM = Not meaningful We currently forecast our costs per ASM excluding fuel and the fleet transition costs for the first quarter and full year of 2008 to be up about 1% and flat, respectively, compared to 2007. CONSOLIDATED NONOPERATING INCOME (EXPENSE) Net nonoperating expense was $10.4 million in 2007 compared to $0.5 million in 2006. Interest income declined by $0.4 million compared to 2006, primarily as a result of a lower average cash and marketable securities balance, partially offset by higher average portfolio returns. Interest expense increased $10.0 million because of new debt arrangements in 2006 and 2007 and increases in the average interest rate on our variable-rate debt. This increase was offset by the conversion to equity of our $150 million senior convertible notes in April 2006, which eliminated further interest expense on those notes. Other-net increased $2.6 million, and includes a $3.75 million expense associated with our investment in Row 44 given their early 46 Table of Contents stage nature. Capitalized interest increased $3.1 million from 2006, resulting from an increase in pre-delivery deposits in connection with our orders for B737-800 and Bombardier Q400 aircraft. CONSOLIDATED INCOME TAX EXPENSE (BENEFIT) Our consolidated effective income tax rate on income (loss) before income taxes for 2007 was 38.0% compared to an effective income tax rate of 40.1% in 2006. The effective rate for 2007 was positively impacted by $2.1 million in credits resulting from a favorable outcome of the state income tax matters referred to in Note 13. Excluding this benefit, our effective tax rate would have been 39.0%, which is different from our marginal 2007 tax rate of 37.4%. The difference is primarily due to the magnitude of nondeductible expenses, such as employee per-diem costs and stock-based compensation expense recorded for certain stock awards. The 2006 year includes $5.5 million of tax benefits associated with the reduction of certain tax contingency accruals for periods for which the statute of limitations expired in 2006. Excluding this benefit, our effective tax benefit rate for 2006 would have been 33.8%. 2006 COMPARED WITH 2005 Our consolidated net loss for 2006 was $52.6 million, or $1.39 per share, compared to a net loss of $5.9 million, or $0.01 per diluted share, in 2005. Both the 2006 and 2005 results include certain significant items that affect the comparability of the years: Our 2006 consolidated net loss includes charges of $189.5 million ($118.5 million after tax) associated with our fleet transition plan (See Note 2 to the consolidated financial statements); We recorded restructuring charges of $24.8 million ($15.5 million after tax) in 2006 associated with the severance packages offered to eligible employees affected by new contracts this year compared to $20.4 million ($12.7 million after tax) in 2005 related to severance costs resulting from the subcontracting of the ramp services operation in Seattle and costs associated with the termination of the lease at our Oakland heavy maintenance base; Adjustments to reflect the timing of gain or loss recognition resulting from mark-to-market fuel hedge accounting totaling $89.9 million ($56.3 million after tax) of losses and $61.7 million ($38.6 million after tax) of gains in 2006 and 2005, respectively; Our 2005 consolidated net loss includes a $144.7 million pretax ($90.4 million after tax) charge resulting from the change in the method of accounting for major airframe and engine overhauls as discussed in Note 17 to the consolidated financial statements; and Our 2005 results also include a $5.7 million ($3.6 million after tax) refund, including $1.0 million of related interest income, for navigation fees paid in Mexico. We believe disclosure of the impact of these individual charges is useful information to investors and other readers because of the reasons provided above in the 2007 Compared With 2006 section. Alaska reported a 2006 loss before income taxes of $92.2 million, while Horizon reported income before income taxes of $11.7 million. Financial and statistical data for Alaska and Horizon are shown on pages 34 and 35, respectively. ALASKA AIRLINES Alaska reported a loss before income taxes of $92.2 million during 2006 compared to income before income taxes and accounting change of $124.2 million in 2005. The $216.4 million difference between the years is primarily the result of the fleet transition and restructuring charges recognized in 2006 totaling $218.4 million, combined with a significant increase in fuel expenses, offset by an 11.4% increase in operating revenues and a reduction in maintenance costs and aircraft rent. 47 Table of Contents As purchased capacity activity was not significant in 2006 and 2005, the ensuing discussion will be focused on mainline operations only. ALASKA MAINLINE REVENUES Mainline operating revenues increased $276.9 million, or 11.5%, during 2006 primarily as a result of a 6.8% increase in operating revenue per available seat mile (RASM) and a 4.4% increase in capacity. The increase in mainline RASM was driven almost entirely by a 6.7% increase in ticket yields resulting largely from higher ticket prices. The increase in capacity is primarily the result of having a larger aircraft fleet and a longer average stage length in 2006. Load factor increased slightly by 0.7 percentage points to 76.6% during 2006. Freight and mail revenues increased $3.1 million, or 3.4%, compared to 2005 primarily resulting from higher mail and freight yields and fuel surcharges that we added to our freight services beginning in the third quarter of 2005, offset by lower freight volumes. Revenues from our cargo operations were lower than expected for 2006 due to the delay in the delivery of our modified 737-400 cargo aircraft. Three of the four were originally scheduled for delivery in 2006, but none was actually delivered until 2007. These delays kept the cargo operations from increasing capacity and thereby the volume of cargo shipped. Other-net revenues increased only slightly by $3.7 million, or 2.9%. Mileage Plan revenues were slightly lower than in 2006, primarily as a result of lower commissions recognized for sold miles. As yields increased in 2006, the rate at which we defer the revenue related to sold miles increased, resulting in a smaller percentage of cash receipts recorded as commission revenue during the period. The decline in commission revenue associated with sold miles was partially offset by higher net revenues from award redemption on our partner airlines. ALASKA AIRLINES MAINLINE EXPENSES Total mainline operating expenses increased $513.1 million, or 22.7%, as compared to 2005. This increase is largely due to fleet transition costs in 2006, a significant increase in aircraft fuel (including hedging gains and losses as we adjust the value of our hedges that will benefit future periods), and increases in wages and benefits, variable incentive pay, contracted services, selling expenses, depreciation and amortization, and restructuring charges, offset by a decline in aircraft maintenance and aircraft rent. Additional line item information is provided below. Wages and Benefits Wages and benefits increased by $21.2 million, or 2.9%, during 2006 compared to 2005 primarily as a result of the following: a $2.7 million signing bonus and an increase in wages resulting from the new four-year contract with our flight attendants that was ratified during the second quarter of 2006; a $1.9 million signing bonus and an increase in wages resulting from the new four-year contract with our clerical, office and passenger service employees and our ramp service and stores agents that was ratified during the third quarter of 2006; market-based pay adjustments for our non-union personnel in the spring of 2006 and an increase in stock-based compensation expense following the adoption of SFAS 123R; an increase in mechanics wages resulting from the contract ratified in the fourth quarter of 2005; and increased postretirement medical and pension costs. The increase from the prior year was partially offset by the following: the reduction in pilot wages resulting from the pilot contract that took effect in May 2005; and the subcontracting of our ramp services operation in Seattle in the second quarter of 2005. 48 Table of Contents Variable Incentive Pay Variable incentive pay increased $12.4 million, or 81.0%, over 2005, primarily as a result of a significant improvement in Air Group 2006 profit, as defined in the incentive agreements. Aircraft Fuel Aircraft fuel increased $281.0 million, or 59.0%, in 2006 compared to 2005. The elements of the change are illustrated in the following table: Year Ended December 31 (in millions, except per-gallon amounts) 2006 2005 % Change Fuel gallons consumed 354.3 346.4 2.3 Raw price per gallon $ 2.16 $ 1.84 17.4 Total raw fuel expense $ 765.6 $ 637.9 20.0 Impact on fuel expense from value changes in the fuel hedge portfolio (gain) (8.6 ) (161.9 ) NM Aircraft fuel expense $ 757.0 $ 476.0 59.0 NM = Not meaningful Fuel gallons consumed increased by 2.3% primarily as a result of the increased capacity and the addition of new aircraft. Raw fuel cost per gallon increased by 17.4% as a result of higher West Coast jet fuel prices driven by the sharp increase in average world oil prices. During 2006, we recorded a $78.4 million mark-to-market loss, reflecting a decline in the value of our fuel hedge portfolio between December 31, 2005 and December 31, 2006. In 2005, we recorded a $53.1 million mark-to-market gain, reflecting an increase in the value of the portfolio from the previous year. These mark-to-market adjustments are largely driven by the closing price of crude oil on the last date of the reporting period and can fluctuate significantly from period to period. The total cash benefit from hedges that settled during the period declined from $108.8 million in 2005 to $87.0 million in 2006. Our economic fuel expense is calculated as follows: Year Ended December 31 (in millions, except per-gallon amounts) 2006 2005 % Change Raw fuel expense $ 765.6 $ 637.9 20.0 Less: cash received from settled hedges (87.0 ) (108.8 ) NM Economic fuel expense $ 678.6 $ 529.1 28.3 Fuel gallons consumed 354.3 346.4 2.3 Economic fuel cost per gallon $ 1.92 $ 1.53 25.5 NM = Not meaningful Aircraft Maintenance Aircraft maintenance decreased by $28.4 million, or 15.3%, mostly as a result of fewer high-dollar engine maintenance events, a decline in the number and change in the mix of airframe events, lower per-event costs due to renegotiated contracts with our outside vendors, and savings from process improvement initiatives. Aircraft Rent Aircraft rent decreased by $5.9 million, or 5.1%, primarily as a result of the buyout of five MD-80 aircraft from leases during the third quarter of 2006, offset by two new B737-800 operating leases entered into in the fourth quarter of 2006. Landing Fees and Other Rentals Landing fees and other rentals increased slightly by $2.0 million, or 1.3%, as a result of slightly higher airport and security costs, specifically at Los Angeles International Airport (LAX) where a retroactive increase to the beginning of 2006 was imposed on certain carriers late in the year. 49 Table of Contents The increase for Alaska was approximately $1.5 million. A large portion of this rate increase and retroactive charge was reversed and returned in 2007. Contracted Services Contracted services increased $12.6 million, or 12.0%, primarily resulting from the subcontracting of the Company Seattle ramp operations in May 2005. Additionally, a $4.7 million navigation fee refund was received in 2005, which reduced our 2005 expenses. Selling Expenses Selling expenses increased $8.9 million, or 6.7%, primarily as a result of an increase in revenue-related expenses such as credit card and codeshare commissions in connection with the rise in revenues over the prior period and an increase in incentive payments to Horizon for certain flying under the former revenue-sharing arrangement. Depreciation and Amortization Depreciation and amortization increased $12.4 million, or 9.9%, compared to 2005. This increase is primarily due to the delivery of two new owned B737-800 aircraft in 2005 and ten new, owned B737-800 aircraft in 2006, the purchase of five MD-80 aircraft from lessors during the third quarter of 2006, and the acceleration of depreciation on our owned MD-80 fleet to reduce the carrying value to estimated realizable value as they come out of the fleet, offset by the lower depreciable base on the MD-80 fleet following the impairment charge taken in the first quarter of 2006. Operating Costs per Available Seat Mile (CASM) As discussed above, operating costs per ASM (CASM) is an important metric in the industry and we use it to gauge the effectiveness of our cost- reduction efforts. Our mainline operating costs per mainline ASM are summarized below: Years Ended December 31 2006 2005 % Change Total mainline operating expenses per ASM (CASM) 11.92 10.14 17.6 CASM includes the following components: Fuel costs per ASM 3.25 2.13 52.6 Fleet transition costs per ASM 0.81 NM Restructuring charges per ASM 0.11 0.09 NM Navigation fee refund per ASM (0.02 ) NM = Not meaningful HORIZON AIR Horizon reported pretax income of $11.7 million during 2006 compared to income before income taxes and accounting change of $26.4 million in 2005. The $14.7 million decrease is primarily due to a 19.9% increase in operating costs, driven primarily by increased fuel and maintenance costs, offset by a 15.7% increase in operating revenues. HORIZON AIR REVENUES Operating revenues increased $87.6 million, or 15.7%, in 2006 compared to 2005. This increase reflects an 8.4% increase in per unit revenues (RASM) and a 6.8% increase in capacity. Horizon passenger revenues are summarized in the table below: Revenues (in millions) and % of ASMs Year Ended December 31 2006 2005 Revenues % ASMs Revenues % ASMs Passenger revenue from Horizon brand flying $ 359.1 48 $ 270.2 44 Passenger revenue Alaska revenue share markets 221.5 29 223.4 33 Revenue from CPA with Frontier JetExpress 52.5 23 50.4 23 Total Passenger Revenue and % of ASMs $ 633.1 100 $ 544.0 100 50 Table of Contents The capacity increase is primarily due to the addition of one CRJ-700 in January 2006, two Q400s that began operating in June and August 2006, increased capacity from adding four more seats to our Q400s in the third quarter of 2005, and increased flying for Frontier. Revenue and capacity from the Frontier contract flying represented approximately 8% of passenger revenues and 23% of capacity in 2006, similar to 2005. The RASM increase from the prior-year period resulted from a 9.1% RASM increase in our native network flying (including brand flying and Alaska revenue share markets), offset by a 1.4% decline in RASM from the Frontier contract flying. The Frontier decline is a function of a 5.7% increase in capacity coupled with a fee arrangement based on certain measures that did not correspond to capacity. As such, the per-unit revenues were diluted as more capacity was added. Passenger load factor increased 1.3 percentage points to 74.1% as a result of an increase in demand. Passenger yield increased 7.0% to 23.53 cents, largely benefiting from industry-wide fare increases. HORIZON EXPENSES Operating expenses for 2006 increased $104.9 million, or 19.9%, compared to 2005, primarily due to increases in aircraft fuel, wages and benefits, and aircraft maintenance. Explanations of significant year-over-year changes in the components of operating expenses in dollar terms are as follows: Wages and Benefits Wages and benefits increased $15.6 million, or 9.0%, over 2005, reflecting a 4.5% increase in the average number of full-time equivalent employees and an increase in wages per employee resulting from market and contract step increases. Variable Incentive Pay Variable incentive pay increased $4.4 million, or 93.6%, over 2005, as a result of the same reasons noted above in the Alaska discussion. Aircraft Fuel Aircraft fuel increased $43.6 million, or 59.8%, in 2006 compared to 2005. The elements of the change are illustrated in the following table: (in millions, except per-gallon amounts) Year Ended December 31 2006 2005 % Change Fuel gallons consumed 54.3 51.3 5.8 Raw price per gallon $ 2.19 $ 1.90 15.3 Total raw fuel expense $ 119.1 $ 97.7 21.9 Impact on fuel expense from value changes in the fuel hedge portfolio (gain) (2.6 ) (24.8 ) NM Aircraft fuel expense $ 116.5 $ 72.9 59.8 NM = Not meaningful Fuel gallons consumed increased by 5.8% primarily as a result of an increase in capacity and block hours. Raw fuel cost per gallon increased by 15.3% as a result of higher West Coast jet fuel prices driven by the sharp increase in average world oil prices. During 2006, we recorded an $11.5 million mark-to-market loss reflecting a decline in the value of our fuel hedge portfolio between December 31, 2005 and December 31, 2006. In 2005, we recorded an $8.6 million mark-to-market gain reflecting an increase in the value of the portfolio from the previous year. These mark-to-market adjustments are largely driven by the closing price of crude oil on the last date of the reporting period and can fluctuate significantly from period to period. The total cash benefit from hedges that settled during the period declined from $16.2 million in 2005 to $14.1 million in 2006. Our economic fuel expense is calculated as follows: (in millions, except per-gallon amounts) Year Ended December 31 2006 2005 % Change Raw fuel expense $ 119.1 $ 97.7 21.9 Less: cash received from settled hedges (14.1 ) (16.2 ) NM Economic fuel expense $ 105.0 $ 81.5 28.8 Fuel gallons consumed 54.3 51.3 5.8 Economic fuel cost per gallon $ 1.93 $ 1.58 22.2 NM = Not meaningful 51 Table of Contents Aircraft Maintenance Aircraft maintenance expense increased $30.6 million, or 70.7%, primarily as a result of more scheduled heavy checks and engine overhauls for the Q200 and Q400 fleets with fewer aircraft covered under warranty. Aircraft Rent Aircraft rent declined slightly by $0.9 million, or 1.3%, in 2006 primarily resulting from the annualization of lower rates on extended leases and fewer leased engines. Other Operating Expenses Other operating expenses increased by $4.7 million, or 11.1%, largely as a result of higher crew expenses and passenger remuneration costs. Operating Costs per Available Seat Mile (CASM) As discussed above, operating costs per ASM (CASM) is an important metric in the industry and we use it to gauge the effectiveness of our cost-reduction efforts. Like Alaska, Horizon efforts to reduce unit costs focus not only on controlling the actual dollars we spend, but also on increasing available seat miles without adding a commensurate amount of cost. Our operating costs per ASM are summarized below: Years Ended December 31 2006 2005 % Change Total operating expenses per ASM (CASM) 17.40 15.50 12.2 CASM includes the following components: Fuel costs per ASM 3.21 2.14 50.0 CONSOLIDATED NONOPERATING INCOME (EXPENSE) Net nonoperating expense was $0.5 million in 2006 compared to $29.3 million in 2005. Interest income increased $23.4 million compared to 2005, primarily as a result of higher average portfolio returns and a higher average cash and marketable securities balance. Interest expense increased $15.0 million primarily resulting from interest rate increases on our variable-rate debt, new debt arrangements in 2006, and the changes to some of our variable-rate debt arrangements to slightly higher fixed rates. This increase was offset by the conversion of our $150 million senior convertible notes to equity in April 2006, which eliminated further interest expense on those notes. Capitalized interest increased $15.8 million from $8.9 million in 2005 to $24.7 million during 2006. This is due to the significant increase in pre-delivery deposits in connection with our orders for B737-800 and Bombardier Q400 aircraft. CONSOLIDATED INCOME TAX EXPENSE (BENEFIT) Our consolidated effective income tax rate on pretax income before the cumulative effect of the accounting change for 2006 was 40.1% compared to an effective income tax rate of 38.4% in 2005. The 2006 year also includes $5.5 million of tax benefits associated with the reduction of certain tax contingency accruals for periods for which the statute of limitations expired in 2006. Excluding this benefit, our effective tax benefit rate for 2006 would have been 33.8%, which is different from our marginal 2006 tax rate of 37.4%. The difference is primarily due to the magnitude of nondeductible expenses, such as employee per-diem costs and stock-based compensation expense recorded for certain stock awards. We applied our 2005 marginal rate of 37.5% to the cumulative effect of the accounting change. CHANGE IN ACCOUNTING POLICY Effective January 1, 2005, we changed our method of accounting for major airframe and engine overhauls from the capitalize and amortize method to the direct expense method. Under the former method, these costs were capitalized and amortized to maintenance expense over the shorter of the life of the overhaul or the remaining lease term. Under the direct expense method, overhaul costs are expensed as incurred. We believe that the direct expense method is preferable because it 52 Table of Contents eliminates the judgment and estimation needed to determine overhaul versus repair allocations in maintenance activities. Additionally, our approved maintenance program for the majority of our airframes now focuses more on shorter, but more frequent, maintenance visits. We also believe that the direct expense method is the predominant method used in the airline industry. Accordingly, effective January 1, 2005, we wrote off the net book value of our previously capitalized airframe and engine overhauls for all aircraft resulting in a charge of $144.7 million pretax ($90.4 million after tax). We do not believe disclosing the effect of adopting the direct expense method on net income for 2005 provides meaningful information because of changes in our maintenance program, including the execution of a power-by-the-hour engine maintenance agreement with a third party in late 2004. CRITICAL ACCOUNTING ESTIMATES The discussion and analysis of our financial position and results of operations in this MD&A is based upon our consolidated financial statements. The preparation of these financial statements requires us to make estimates and judgments that affect our financial position and results of operations. See Note 1 to the consolidated financial statements for a description of our significant accounting policies. Critical accounting estimates are defined as those that are reflective of significant judgment and uncertainties, and that potentially may result in materially different results under varying assumptions and conditions. Management has identified the following critical accounting estimates and has discussed the development, selection and disclosure of these policies with our audit committee. MILEAGE PLAN Our Mileage Plan loyalty program awards miles to member passengers who fly on Alaska or Horizon and our many travel partners. Additionally, we sell miles to third parties, such as our bank partner, for cash. In either case, the outstanding miles may be redeemed for travel on Alaska, Horizon or any of our alliance partners. As long as the Mileage Plan is in existence, we have an obligation to provide this future travel. For awards earned by passengers who fly on Alaska, Horizon or our travel partners, we recognize a liability and the corresponding selling expense for this future obligation. For miles sold to third parties, the majority of the sales proceeds are recorded as deferred revenue and recognized when the award transportation is provided. The commission component of these sales proceeds (defined as the proceeds we receive from the sale of mileage credits minus the amount we defer) is recorded as other-net revenue when the cash is received. The deferred revenue is recognized as passenger revenue when awards are issued and flown on Alaska or Horizon, and as other-net revenue for awards issued and flown on partner airlines. At December 31, 2007, we had approximately 114 billion miles outstanding, resulting in an aggregate liability and deferred revenue balance of $648.5 million. Both the liability and the deferred revenue are determined based on several assumptions that require significant management judgment to estimate and formulate. There are uncertainties inherent in estimates; therefore, an incorrect assumption could greatly affect the amount and/or timing of revenue recognition or Mileage Plan expenses. The most significant assumptions in accounting for the Mileage Plan are described below. 1. The rate at which we defer sales proceeds from sold miles: We defer an amount that represents our estimate of the fair value of a free travel award by looking to the sales prices of comparable paid travel. As fare levels change, our deferral rate changes, which may result in the recognition of a higher or lower portion of the cash proceeds from the sale of miles as commission revenue in any given quarter. For example, due to the year-over-year increases in average ticket prices, our deferral rate increased in 2007, resulting in lower commission revenue and an increase in the amount of revenue deferred for miles sold. Holding all other assumptions constant, an additional 1% increase in the deferral rate would have 53 Table of Contents reduced our 2007 commission revenue by approximately $2.4 million. 2. The number of miles that will not be redeemed for travel (breakage): Members may not reach the mileage threshold necessary for a free ticket, and outstanding miles may not always be redeemed for travel. Therefore, based on the number of Mileage Plan accounts and the miles in the accounts, we estimate how many miles will never be used ( breakage ), and do not record a liability for those miles. Our estimates of breakage consider activity in our members accounts, account balances, and other factors. We believe our breakage assumptions are reasonable in light of historical experience and future expectations. A hypothetical 1.0% change in our estimate of breakage (currently 12% in the aggregate) has approximately a $7.2 million effect on the liability. Actual breakage could differ significantly from our estimates. 3. The number of miles used per award (i.e., free ticket): We estimate how many miles will be used per award. For example, our members may redeem credit for free travel to various locations or choose between a highly restricted award and an unrestricted award. If actual miles used are more or less than estimated, we may need to adjust the liability and corresponding expense. Our estimates are based on the current requirements in our Mileage Plan program and historical redemptions on Alaska, Horizon or other airlines. 4. The number of awards redeemed for travel on Alaska or Horizon versus other airlines: The cost for Alaska or Horizon to carry an award passenger is typically lower than the cost we will pay to other airlines. We estimate the number of awards that will be redeemed on Alaska or Horizon versus on other airlines and accrue the estimated costs based on historical redemption patterns. If the number of awards redeemed on other airlines is higher or lower than estimated, we may need to adjust our liability and corresponding expense. 5. The costs that will be incurred to provide award travel: When a frequent flyer travels on his or her award ticket on Alaska or Horizon, incremental costs such as food, fuel and insurance are incurred to carry that passenger. We estimate what these costs will be (excluding any contribution to overhead and profit) and accrue a liability. If the passenger travels on another airline on an award ticket, we often must pay the other airline for carrying the passenger. The other airline costs are based on negotiated agreements and are often substantially higher than the costs we would incur to carry that passenger. We estimate how much we will pay to other airlines for future travel awards based on historical redemptions and settlements with other carriers and accrue a liability accordingly. The costs actually incurred by us or paid to other airlines may be higher or lower than the costs that were estimated and accrued, and therefore we may need to adjust our liability and recognize a corresponding expense. We review significant Mileage Plan assumptions each quarter and change our assumptions if facts and circumstances indicate that a change is necessary. Any such change in assumptions could have a significant effect on our financial position and results of operations. PENSION PLANS We account for the defined-benefit pension plans using SFAS No. 158, Employers Accounting for Defined Benefit Pension and Other Postretirement Plans, an amendment of FASB Statements No. 87, 88, 106 and 132(R) (SFAS 158). SFAS 158 requires recognition of the overfunded or underfunded status of an entity defined-benefit pension and other postretirement plan as an asset or liability in the financial statements and requires recognition of the funded status in other comprehensive income. 54 Table of Contents Under SFAS No. 158, pension expense is recognized on an accrual basis over employees approximate service periods and is generally independent of funding decisions or requirements. We recognized expense for our qualified defined-benefit pension plans of $62.6 million, $78.3 million, and $71.7 million in 2007, 2006, and 2005, respectively. The calculation of pension expense and the corresponding liability requires the use of a number of important assumptions, including the expected long-term rate of return on plan assets and the assumed discount rate. Changes in these assumptions can result in different expense and liability amounts, and future actual experience can differ from these assumptions. Pension expense increases as the expected rate of return on pension plan assets decreases. As of December 31, 2007, we estimate that the pension plan assets will generate a long-term rate of return of 7.75%. This rate was developed using historical data as well as long-term inflation assumptions. We regularly review the actual asset allocation and periodically rebalance investments as appropriate. This expected long-term rate of return on plan assets at December 31, 2007 is based on an allocation of U.S. and non-U.S. equities and U.S. fixed income securities. Decreasing the expected long-term rate of return by 0.5% (from 7.75% to 7.25%) would increase our estimated 2008 pension expense by approximately $4.5 million. Pension liability and future pension expense increase as the discount rate is reduced. We discounted future pension obligations using a rate of 6.00% and 5.75% at December 31, 2007 and 2006, respectively. The discount rate is determined based on the current rates earned on high-quality long-term bonds. Decreasing the discount rate by 0.5% (from 6.00% to 5.50%) would increase our projected benefit obligation at December 31, 2007 by approximately $79.1 million and increase estimated 2008 pension expense by approximately $9.4 million. With the exception of the plan covering Alaska pilots, all of our defined-benefit pension plans are closed to new entrants. Future changes in plan asset returns, assumed discount rates and various other factors related to the participants in our pension plans will impact our future pension expense and liabilities. We cannot predict what these factors will be in the future. LONG-LIVED ASSETS As of December 31, 2007, we had approximately $3.0 billion of property and equipment and related assets, net of accumulated depreciation. In accounting for these long-lived assets, we make estimates about the expected useful lives of the assets, changes in fleet plans, the expected residual values of the assets, and the potential for impairment based on the fair value of the assets and the cash flows they generate. Factors indicating potential impairment include, but are not limited to, significant decreases in the market value of the long-lived assets, management decisions regarding the future use of the assets, a significant change in the long-lived assets condition, and operating cash flow losses associated with the use of the long-lived asset. In March 2006, our Board approved a plan to accelerate the retirement of our MD-80 fleet (15 owned and 11 leased aircraft at the time) and remove those aircraft from service by the end of 2008, which is earlier than the original retirement schedule. As a result of this decision, we evaluated impairment as required by SFAS No. 144, Accounting for the Impairment or Disposal of Long-Lived Assets , and concluded that the carrying value of the MD-80 fleet was no longer recoverable when compared to the estimated remaining future cash flows. Accordingly, during the first quarter of 2006, the Company recorded an impairment charge totaling $131.1 million to write down the fleet to its estimated fair market value. Additionally, during the third quarter of 2006, we bought five MD-80 aircraft from lessors and terminated the leases for those five aircraft. The total purchase price for the five aircraft was $80.9 million, including assumed debt of $11.6 million. Immediately upon purchase of the aircraft, we evaluated impairment and concluded that the carrying value was not recoverable. As a result, we recorded an 55 Table of Contents additional $58.4 million charge in the third quarter for the impairment. See Note 2 in the consolidated financial statements for further discussion about the impairment of the MD-80s. In 2007, Horizon announced plans to phase out its remaining leased Q200 aircraft by the end of 2009 and is in the process of evaluating potential arrangements to dispose of those leased aircraft. All of these aircraft are leased under operating lease agreements. However, as a result of this decision, we reassessed the depreciable lives and salvage values of the related rotable and repairable Q200 parts and, as such, we have increased the periodic depreciation expense. We are early in the process of evaluating whether further fleet simplification of Horizon fleet would be beneficial. Such simplification could involve a move away from the CRJ-700 aircraft to an all-Q400 fleet. No decisions have been made at this time. However, should we decide to exit the CRJ-700 fleet prior to the end of the lease expiration for those aircraft, we would likely revise the useful lives of the related rotable and repairable parts, which would result in higher depreciation expense. There is inherent risk in estimating the fair value of our aircraft and related parts and their salvage values at the time of impairment. Actual proceeds upon disposition of the aircraft or related parts could be materially less than expected, resulting in additional loss. Our estimate of salvage value at the time of disposal could also change, requiring us to increase the depreciation expense on the affected aircraft. WORKERS COMPENSATION AND EMPLOYEE HEALTH-CARE ACCRUALS We use a combination of insurance and self-insurance mechanisms to provide for workers compensation claims and employee health-care benefits. Liabilities associated with these risks are not discounted and are estimated, in part, by considering historical claims experience, severity factors and other actuarial assumptions. The estimated accruals for these liabilities could be significantly affected if future occurrences and claims differ from these assumptions and historical trends. Our workers compensation and employee health care accruals totaled $42.9 million at December 31, 2007, compared to $42.7 million at December 31, 2006. NEW ACCOUNTING STANDARDS In September 2006, the FASB issued Statement of Financial Accounting Standards No. 157, Fair Value Measurements (SFAS 157), which defines fair value, establishes a framework for measuring fair value and expands disclosure about fair-value measurements required under other accounting pronouncements. SFAS 157 does not change existing guidance as to whether or not an instrument is carried at fair value. The statement is effective for financial and nonfinancial assets and liabilities for fiscal years beginning after November 15, 2007 and 2008, respectively. We are currently evaluating the impact of adopting SFAS 157 but do not expect the statement to have a significant impact on our results from operations or financial position. In February 2007, the FASB issued SFAS No. 159, The Fair Value Option for Financial Assets and Financial Liabilities , which allows entities the option to measure eligible financial instruments at fair value as of specified dates. Such election, which may be applied on an instrument-by-instrument basis, is typically irrevocable once elected. This statement is effective for fiscal years beginning after November 15, 2007, and early adoption is allowed under certain circumstances. We do not expect this statement to have a significant impact on our financial position, results of operations or cash flows. In December 2007, the FASB issued SFAS No. 141R, Business Combinations , and SFAS No. 160, Noncontrolling Interests in Consolidated Financial Statements . These standards were issued jointly and will require most identifiable assets, liabilities, noncontrolling interests, and goodwill acquired in a business combination to be recorded at full fair value and will require noncontrolling interests (previously referred to as minority interests) to be reported as a component of equity, which changes the accounting for transactions with noncontrolling interest holders. Both statements 56 Table of Contents are effective for fiscal years beginning on or after December 15, 2008. SFAS No. 141R will be applied only to acquisitions subsequent to the effective date and SFAS No. 160 will be applied prospectively to all noncontrolling interests, including any that arose before the effective date. We do not expect these statements to have a significant impact on our financial position, results of operations, or cash flows. LIQUIDITY AND CAPITAL RESOURCES The table below presents the major indicators of financial condition and liquidity. (In millions, except per-share and debt-to-capital amounts) December 31, 2007 December 31, 2006 Change Cash and marketable securities $ 822.8 $ 1,013.9 $ (191.1 ) Long-term debt, net of current portion 1,124.6 1,031.7 92.9 Shareholders equity 1,024.0 885.5 138.5 Book value per common share outstanding $ 26.91 $ 21.97 $ 4.94 Long-term debt-to-capital 52%:48 % 54%:46 % (2) pts Long-term debt-to-capital assuming aircraft operating leases are capitalized at seven times annualized rent 70%:30 % 72%:28 % (2) pts During the year ended December 31, 2007, our cash and marketable securities declined $191.1 million to $822.8 million. The following discussion summarizes the primary drivers of the decrease and our expectation of future cash requirements. ANALYSIS OF OUR CASH FLOWS Cash Provided by Operating Activities During 2007, net cash provided by operating activities was $482.0 million, compared to $449.8 million during 2006. The increase resulted from higher revenues and lower cash contributions to our defined-benefit pension plans in 2007, offset by the $47.7 million reduction in cash received from settled hedges, and higher raw fuel costs and other non-fuel operating expenses. We contributed $52.5 million to our defined-benefit pension plans in 2007 compared to $121.9 million in 2006. We typically generate positive cash flows from operations, but anticipate consuming substantially all of that cash for capital expenditures and debt payments in 2008 and 2009. Cash Used in Investing Activities Our investing activities are primarily made up of capital expenditures associated with our fleet transition programs and, to a lesser extent, purchases and sales of marketable securities. Cash used in investing activities was $601.8 million during 2007, compared to $533.0 million in 2006. Our capital expenditures grew by $152.3 million as a result of the purchase of 14 B737-800s and 13 Q400s, versus the purchase of ten B737-800s, five leased MD-80s, two Q400s and one CRJ-700 in 2006. This was partially offset by proceeds of approximately $50 million from the sale of our MD-80s, which were subsequently leased back. We currently expect capital expenditures to be approximately $570 million (of which $490 million is expected to be aircraft-related) during 2008 as we take delivery of 16 new B737-800s and three new Q400s. Capital expenditures are expected to decrease significantly in 2009 and 2010 as we near the end of our committed firm aircraft deliveries. We do have a number of options for both B737-800 and Q400 aircraft available should we decide to convert those into firm commitments. However, a decision to exercise those options is highly dependent on our ability to deploy those new aircraft profitably and generate returns that exceed our cost of capital. Cash Provided by Financing Activities We finance a large portion of our capital spending with debt financing. Net cash provided by financing activities was $93.4 million during 57 Table of Contents 2007 compared to $240.3 million during 2006. We obtained debt financing of $196.1 million for six new B737-800 aircraft and received $6.1 million of cash upon the issuance of common stock through stock option exercises and our employee stock purchase plan. Additionally, we borrowed $85.8 million using our pre-delivery payment facility. Offsetting these cash inflows were normal long-term debt payments of $132.2 million and the $62.8 million repurchase of 2.6 million shares of our common stock. We plan to meet our significant capital and operating commitments through internally generated funds from operations and cash and marketable securities on hand, additional debt financing, and availability of credit under our pre-delivery payment facility. We have financing already in place for deliveries of B737-800s through 2009 and, subsequent to December 31, 2007, we closed financing on 13 of our Q400s, resulting in cash proceeds of $193 million. Bank Line-of-Credit Facility Alaska has a $185 million variable-rate credit facility that expires in March 2010. As of December 31, 2007, there are no outstanding borrowings on this credit facility and the Company has no immediate plans to borrow using this credit facility. See Note 5 in the consolidated financial statements for further discussion. Pre-delivery Payment Facility Alaska $172 million variable-rate revolving loan facility is available to provide a portion of the pre-delivery funding requirements of Alaska purchase of new Boeing 737-800 aircraft under the current aircraft purchase agreement. The maximum available amount is reduced to $152 million beginning in August 2009. The facility expires on August 31, 2011. The interest rate is based on one-month LIBOR plus a specified margin. Any borrowings will be secured by Alaska rights under the Boeing purchase agreement. The principal amounts outstanding on the facility relate to specified aircraft and will be repaid at the time that Alaska takes delivery of the aircraft, if not sooner. As of December 31, 2007, $85.8 million was outstanding. CONTRACTUAL OBLIGATIONS, COMMITMENTS AND OFF-BALANCE SHEET ARRANGEMENTS Aircraft Purchase Commitments At December 31, 2007, we had firm orders to purchase 46 aircraft requiring future aggregate payments of approximately $1.0 billion, as set forth below. Alaska also has committed to delivery of one new B737-800 aircraft in 2008 under an operating lease arrangement. Alaska has options to acquire 45 additional B737s and Horizon has options to acquire 20 Q400s. Alaska and Horizon expect to finance the firm orders and, to the extent exercised, the option aircraft with leases, long-term debt or internally generated cash. During 2007, Alaska took delivery of 14 B737-800s, all of which were paid for with cash on hand. Six were subsequently financed with fixed and variable-rate debt arrangements. Horizon took delivery of 13 Q400s, all of which were paid for with cash on hand. During 2007, Alaska sold and leased back 20 MD-80 aircraft. The following table summarizes aircraft purchase commitments and payments by year, as of December 31, 2007: Delivery Period - Firm Orders Aircraft 2008 2009 2010 2011 Total Boeing 737-800 16 6 6 3 31 Bombardier Q400 3 12 15 Total 19 18 6 3 46 Payments (Millions) $ 491.6 $ 355.3 $ 157.9 $ 44.9 $ 1,049.7 58 Table of Contents Two of the B737-800 aircraft were delivered subsequent to December 31, 2007, but before the filing of this Form 10-K. The two B737-800 were paid for with cash on hand. The remaining B737-800 aircraft scheduled for delivery in 2008 are generally evenly spread throughout the rest of the year, although weighted more toward the last six months of the year. In addition to the 16 purchased aircraft above, Alaska has committed to an operating lease arrangement with a third party for one B737-800 to be delivered in March 2008. The three Q400s will be delivered in the fourth quarter of 2008. Financing for ten of the 2008 B737-800 deliveries has already been arranged. We expect to pay for the remaining deliveries with cash on hand. In January 2008, we obtained financing for 13 of the recently delivered Q400 aircraft, resulting in net proceeds from borrowings of $193 million. Our agreements with Boeing and Bombardier provide us with flexibility to adjust aircraft deliveries in the future should we wish to accelerate or slow our growth. Contractual Obligations The following table provides a summary of our principal payments under current and long-term debt obligations, capital lease obligations, operating lease commitments, aircraft purchase commitments and other obligations as of December 31, 2007. This table excludes contributions to our various pension plans, which we expect to be approximately $50 million to $75 million per year through 2012. Beyond (in millions) 2008 2009 2010 2011 2012 2012 Total Current and long-term debt obligations (excluding the pre-delivery payment facility) $ 90.1 $ 94.8 $ 100.3 $ 133.3 $ 175.5 $ 620.7 $ 1,214.7 Current and long-term portions of the pre-delivery payment facility 85.8 85.8 Operating lease commitments (1) 256.2 231.5 216.6 177.5 178.2 526.2 1,586.2 Aircraft purchase commitments 491.6 355.3 157.9 44.9 1,049.7 Interest obligations (2) 80.6 69.2 62.9 56.3 47.3 130.1 446.4 Other obligations (3) 29.7 30.0 30.3 30.6 30.9 62.7 214.2 Total $ 1,034.0 $ 780.8 $ 568.0 $ 442.6 $ 431.9 $ 1,339.7 $ 4,597.0 (1) Operating lease commitments generally include aircraft operating leases, airport property and hangar leases, office space, and other equipment leases. The aircraft operating leases include lease obligations for four leased MD-80 aircraft, all of which we intend to retire earlier than expected in connection with our fleet transition plan. (2) For variable-rate debt, future obligations are shown above using interest rates in effect as of December 31, 2007. (3) Includes minimum obligations under our long-term power-by-the-hour maintenance agreement, but excludes $27.9 million of unrecognized tax benefits for which we cannot make a reasonably reliable estimate of the amount and period of payment. See Note 13 to the consolidated financial statements. EFFECT OF INFLATION AND PRICE CHANGES Inflation and price changes other than for aircraft fuel do not have a significant effect on our operating revenues, operating expenses and operating income. OTHER We strive to provide a return to our investors that exceeds the cost of the capital employed in our business. Our targeted return on invested capital (ROIC) is 10%. We have not historically reached this threshold, nor did we in 2007. However, our strategic plan is built on the premise of providing an appropriate return to all capital providers. 59 Table of Contents
