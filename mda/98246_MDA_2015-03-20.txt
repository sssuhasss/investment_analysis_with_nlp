Item 7. Management's Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations. The following discussion and analysis should be read in conjunction with the Company's consolidated financial statements and related notes. All references to years relate to fiscal years which ended on January 31 of the following calendar year. KEY STRATEGIES The Company's key strategies are: To enhance customer awareness of the TIFFANY & CO. trademark (the Brand ), its heritage, its products and its association with quality and luxury. The Brand is the single most important asset of Tiffany and, indirectly, of the Company. Management intends to continue to invest in marketing and public relations programs designed to build awareness of the Brand, its heritage and its products with both new and existing customers, as well as to enhance the Brand association among consumers with quality and luxury. Management plans to continue to monitor these efforts and the strength of the Brand through market research. To maintain an active product development program. The Company continues to invest in product development in order to introduce new design collections and extensions of existing collections that are designed to appeal to the Company existing customer base as well as to new customers. The Company is also investing in the watch category, which it deems appropriate for the Brand and which presents incremental growth opportunities. To enhance the customer experience with superior customer service and through engaging store environments. To ensure a superior shopping experience, the Company employs highly-qualified sales and customer service professionals, focuses on enhancing sales and product training programs, and is investing in enhancing its information systems for customer relationship management. The Company also focuses on enhancing the design of its stores, as well as the creative visual presentation of its merchandise, to provide an engaging luxury experience in both its new and existing stores. To selectively expand global distribution without compromising the value of the Brand. Management intends to continue to expand its global distribution by adding stores in both new and existing markets and through its e-commerce websites. Management recognizes that over-saturation of any market could diminish the distinctive appeal of the Brand, but believes that there are a significant number of potential worldwide locations remaining that meet financial and Brand requirements. To maintain substantial control over product supply through direct diamond sourcing and internal jewelry manufacturing. The Company's diamond processing operations purchase, sort, cut and/or polish rough diamonds for use in merchandise. The Company intends to continue to seek additional sources of diamonds TIFFANY & CO. K- 28 Table of Contents which, combined with continued focus on its internal manufacturing operations, are designed to secure adequate product supplies and favorable product costs. Through the efforts above, management is committed to the following long-term financial objectives: To increase store productivity. Management is committed to growing sales per square foot by increasing both consumer traffic and the percentage of store visitors who make a purchase. In addition, the Company is increasing, through store renovations, the percentage of selling space in some of its stores, which is intended to contribute to higher store productivity. To achieve improved operating margins. Management's long-term objective is to improve operating margin through gross margin improvement, which includes controlling product input costs, realizing greater efficiencies in its product supply chain and adjusting retail prices when appropriate. Additionally, management is focused on enhancing productivity by controlling selling, general and administrative expenses and generating sales leverage on fixed costs. These efforts are intended to generate a higher rate of operating earnings growth relative to sales growth. To improve asset productivity and cash flow. Management's long-term objective is to maintain inventory growth at a rate less than sales growth, with greater focus on efficiencies in product sourcing and manufacturing as well as optimizing store inventory levels, all of which is intended to contribute to improvements in cash flow and return on assets. To maintain a capital structure that provides financial strength and flexibility to pursue strategic initiatives and allows for the return of excess capital to shareholders. 2014 SUMMARY Worldwide net sales increased 5% to $4,249,913,000 . However, the Company experienced a 1% sales decline in the fourth quarter primarily due to softness in the Americas region. On a constant-exchange-rate basis (see "Non-GAAP Measures" below), worldwide net sales in 2014 increased 7% due to sales growth in all regions, and comparable store sales increased 4% . The Company added a net of 6 TIFFANY & CO. stores (opening three in the Americas, two in Japan and one each in Asia-Pacific, Europe and the Emerging Markets while closing two in the Americas). The Company continued to introduce new product designs highlighted by the TIFFANY T collection. Earnings from operations as a percentage of net sales ("operating margin") improved 13.5 percentage points. However, excluding certain expenses in 2013 (see "Non-GAAP Measures" below), operating margin improved 1.3 percentage points due to an increase in gross margin. TIFFANY & CO. K- 29 Table of Contents Net earnings were $484,179,000 , or $3.73 per diluted share. Excluding certain expenses recorded in 2014 and 2013 (see "Non-GAAP Measures" below), net earnings increased 13% to $545,135,000, or $4.20 per diluted share. The Board of Directors approved a 12% increase in the quarterly dividend rate to $0.38 per share of the Company's Common Stock, or an annual dividend rate of $1.52 per share. Free cash flow (see "Non-GAAP Measures" below) was an inflow of $367,723,000 in 2014 , compared with an outflow of $66,800,000 in 2013 which was entirely due to the arbitration award payment. Growth in inventories, net of 2% , or 6% when excluding the effect of foreign currency translation, was less than the rate of sales growth. The Company issued $550,000,000 of senior notes and used the net proceeds primarily to redeem $400,000,000 in aggregate principal amount of existing senior notes. As a result of such issuances and redemptions, the Company's average interest rate on its outstanding long-term debt was reduced and long-term debt maturities were extended. Additionally, the Company entered into new credit facilities with greater borrowing capacities replacing certain previous credit facilities. RESULTS OF OPERATIONS Non-GAAP Measures The Company reports information in accordance with U.S. Generally Accepted Accounting Principles ("GAAP"). The Company's management does not, nor does it suggest that investors should, consider non-GAAP financial measures in isolation from, or as a substitute for, financial information prepared in accordance with GAAP. The Company presents such non-GAAP financial measures in reporting its financial results to provide investors with an additional tool to evaluate the Company's operating results. TIFFANY & CO. K- 30 Table of Contents Net Sales . The Company's reported net sales reflect either a translation-related benefit from strengthening foreign currencies or a detriment from a strengthening U.S. dollar. Internally, management monitors and measures its sales performance on a non-GAAP basis that eliminates the positive or negative effects that result from translating sales made outside the U.S. into U.S. dollars ("constant-exchange-rate basis"). Management believes this constant-exchange-rate basis provides a more representative assessment of sales performance and provides better comparability between reporting periods. The following table reconciles the sales percentage increases (decreases) from the GAAP to the non-GAAP basis versus the previous year: 2014 2013 GAAP Reported Translation Effect Constant- Exchange- Rate Basis GAAP Reported Translation Effect Constant- Exchange- Rate Basis Net Sales: Worldwide 5 % (2 )% 7 % 6 % (4 )% 10 % Americas 6 6 5 5 Asia-Pacific 9 (1 ) 10 17 (1 ) 18 Japan (4 ) (8 ) 4 (9 ) (20 ) 11 Europe 6 6 9 2 7 Other 26 26 53 53 Comparable Store Sales: Worldwide 2 % (2 )% 4 % 3 % (3 )% 6 % Americas 5 (1 ) 6 3 3 Asia-Pacific 3 (1 ) 4 10 (1 ) 11 Japan (7 ) (8 ) 1 (10 ) (20 ) 10 Europe (1 ) (1 ) 6 2 4 Other 8 8 14 14 Statements of Earnings. Internally, management monitors and measures its earnings performance excluding certain items listed below. Management believes excluding such items presents the Company's results on a more comparable basis to the corresponding period in the prior year, thereby providing investors with an additional perspective to analyze the results of operations of the Company. The following tables reconcile certain GAAP amounts to non-GAAP amounts: (in thousands, except per share amounts) GAAP Debt extinguishment a increase/(decrease) Non-GAAP Year Ended January 31, 2015 Loss on extinguishment of debt $ 93,779 $ (93,779 ) $ Provision for income taxes 253,358 32,823 286,181 Net earnings 484,179 60,956 545,135 Diluted earnings per share 3.73 0.47 4.20 a Expenses associated with the redemption of $400,000,000 in aggregate principal amount of certain senior notes prior to their scheduled maturities (see "Loss on Extinguishment of Debt" below).

Financial Statements and Supplementary Data - Note J - Commitments and Contingencies" for further information. c Expenses associated with specific cost-reduction initiatives which included severance related to staffing reductions and subleasing of certain office space for which only a portion of the Company's future rent obligations will be recovered. Free Cash Flow. Internally, management monitors its cash flow on a non-GAAP basis. The ability to generate free cash flow demonstrates how much cash the Company has available for discretionary and non-discretionary items after deduction of capital expenditures. The Company's operations require regular capital expenditures for the opening, renovation and expansion of stores and distribution and manufacturing facilities as well as ongoing investments in information technology. Management believes this provides a more representative assessment of operating cash flows. The following table reconciles GAAP net cash provided by operating activities to non-GAAP free cash flow: Years Ended January 31, ( in thousands) 2015 2014 Net cash provided by operating activities $ 615,117 $ 154,652 Less: Capital expenditures (247,394 ) (221,452 ) Free cash inflow (outflow) $ 367,723 $ (66,800 ) Comparable Store Sales Comparable store sales include only sales transacted in Company-operated stores open for more than 12 months. Sales for relocated stores are included in comparable store sales if the relocation occurs within the same geographical market. Sales for a new store are not included if the store was relocated from one department store to another or from a department store to a free-standing location. In all markets, the results of a store in which the square footage has been expanded or reduced remain in the comparable store base. TIFFANY & CO. K- 32 Table of Contents Net Sales In 2014 , worldwide net sales increased $218,783,000 , or 5% , due to growth in most regions. By product category, the fashion jewelry category increased $137,039,000 , or 8% (reflecting growth in gold jewelry); the engagement jewelry & wedding bands category increased $62,875,000 , or 5% (reflecting growth in solitaire diamond rings and wedding bands); and the statement, fine & solitaire jewelry category increased $13,351,000 , or 1% . In 2013, worldwide net sales increased $236,881,000 , or 6% , due to growth in most regions. By product category, the statement, fine & solitaire jewelry category increased $ 167,707,000 , or 22% (reflecting growth throughout the category, along with growing demand for colored diamonds and other gemstones); the engagement jewelry & wedding bands category increased $49,469,000 , or 4% (reflecting growth in solitaire diamond rings); and the fashion jewelry category increased $36,546,000 , or 2% (primarily due to sales growth of gold jewelry). Certain reclassifications were made to these categories to conform with management's current internal analysis of product sales. Net sales by segment were as follows: (in thousands) 2014 2013 2012 2014 vs. 2013 % Change 2013 vs. 2012 % Change Americas $ 2,033,453 $ 1,926,864 $ 1,839,969 6 % 5 % Asia-Pacific 1,025,169 944,676 810,420 9 17 Japan 554,258 578,571 639,185 (4 ) (9 ) Europe 497,287 469,784 432,167 6 9 Other 139,746 111,235 72,508 26 53 $ 4,249,913 $ 4,031,130 $ 3,794,249 5 % 6 % Americas . Americas currently includes sales in 122 Company-operated TIFFANY & CO. stores in the United States, Canada and Latin America, as well as sales of TIFFANY & CO. products in certain of those markets through business-to-business, Internet, catalog and wholesale operations. Americas represented 48% of worldwide net sales in 2014 , 2013 and 2012 , while sales in the U.S. represented 88%, 88% and 89% of net sales in the Americas in those same periods. In 2014 , total sales increased $106,589,000 , or 6% , due to an 11% increase in the average price per jewelry unit sold, which management attributes to price increases and a shift in sales mix toward higher-priced products. A 5% decline in the number of jewelry units sold was entirely due to soft demand for entry-level price point silver jewelry. Included in the $106,589,000 increase is an $80,856,000, or 5%, increase in comparable store sales due to geographically broad-based growth across most of the region and a $27,824,000 increase in non-comparable store sales. On a constant-exchange-rate basis, both total sales and comparable store sales increased 6% . In 2013, total sales increased $86,895,000, or 5%, due to a 10% increase in the average price per jewelry unit sold partly offset by a 4% decline in the number of jewelry units sold. Management attributes the increase in average price primarily to a shift in sales mix toward higher-priced products and the decrease in unit volume primarily to soft demand for entry-level price point silver jewelry. Included in the $86,895,000 increase is a $43,393,000, or 3%, increase in comparable store sales led by growth in New York Flagship store sales as well as modest growth in branch store sales and a $46,563,000 increase in non-comparable store sales. On a constant-exchange-rate basis, total sales increased 5%, and comparable store sales increased 3%. Asia-Pacific. Asia-Pacific currently includes sales in 73 Company-operated TIFFANY & CO. stores, as well as sales of TIFFANY & CO. products in certain markets through Internet and wholesale operations. Asia- TIFFANY & CO. K- 33 Table of Contents Pacific represented 24% , 23% and 21% of worldwide net sales in 2014 , 2013 and 2012 . Sales in Greater China represented more than half of Asia-Pacific's net sales in those same periods. In 2014 , total sales increased $80,493,000 , or 9% , due to a 5% increase in the average price per jewelry unit sold as well as a 4% increase in the number of jewelry units sold. Management attributes the increase in the average price to price increases and a shift in sales mix toward higher-priced products. The increase in the number of jewelry units sold reflected growth in all product categories. Included in the $80,493,000 increase is a $39,705,000 increase in non-comparable store sales, a $23,959,000, or 3%, increase in comparable store sales and a $17,373,000 increase in wholesale sales of TIFFANY & CO. merchandise to independent distributors. On a constant-exchange-rate basis, total sales increased 10% and comparable store sales increased 4% due to growth in most markets. In 2013, total sales increased $134,256,000, or 17%, due to an 11% increase in the number of jewelry units sold and a 6% increase in the average price per jewelry unit sold. The increase in the number of jewelry units sold reflected growth in all product categories. Management attributes the increase in average price primarily to a shift in sales mix toward higher-priced products. Included in the $134,256,000 increase is a $74,818,000, or 10%, increase in comparable store sales, a $44,519,000 increase in non-comparable store sales and a $15,232,000 increase in sales of TIFFANY & CO. merchandise to independent distributors. On a constant-exchange-rate basis, total sales increased 18% and comparable store sales increased 11% due to geographically broad-based sales growth across the region. Japan. Japan currently includes sales in 56 Company-operated TIFFANY & CO. stores, as well as sales of TIFFANY & CO. products through business-to-business, Internet and wholesale operations. Japan represented 13% , 14% and 17% of worldwide net sales in 2014 , 2013 and 2012 . In 2014 , total sales decreased $24,313,000 , or 4% , and comparable store sales decreased $35,173,000, or 7%, due to currency translation. On a constant-exchange-rate basis, total sales increased 4% due to a 9% increase in the average price per jewelry unit sold partly offset by a 5% decrease in the number of jewelry units sold due to decreases in all categories. Management attributes the increase in average price to price increases and a shift in sales mix toward higher-priced products within the fashion jewelry category. Comparable store sales on a constant-exchange-rate basis increased 1% . The overall sales performance reflected significant sales growth in the first quarter prior to an increase in the consumption tax in April 2014, offset by softness in sales in the remaining quarters. In 2013, total sales decreased $60,614,000, or 9%, and comparable store sales decreased $57,525,000, or 10%, due to currency translation. On a constant-exchange-rate basis, total sales increased 11% primarily due to a 16% increase in the average price per jewelry unit sold partly offset by a 5% decrease in the number of jewelry units sold. Management attributes the increase in average price primarily to a shift in sales mix toward higher-priced products and the decrease in the number of jewelry units sold to reduced fashion jewelry unit sales. Comparable store sales on a constant-exchange-rate basis increased 10%. Europe. Europe currently includes sales in 38 Company-operated TIFFANY & CO. stores, as well as sales of TIFFANY & CO. products in certain markets through the Internet.

In 2014 , total sales increased $27,503,000 , or 6% , due to a 3% increase in both the number of jewelry units sold and in the average price per jewelry unit sold. Management attributes the increase in the number of jewelry units sold to fashion jewelry and the increase in average price to price increases and a shift in sales mix toward higher-priced products within the fashion jewelry category. Included in the $27,503,000 increase is a $26,994,000 increase in non-comparable store sales. On a constant- TIFFANY & CO. K- 34 Table of Contents exchange-rate basis, total sales increased 6% due to strength in continental Europe and comparable store sales decreased 1% . In 2013, total sales increased $37,617,000, or 9%, due to a 5% increase in the number of jewelry units sold and a 4% increase in the average price per jewelry unit sold. Management attributes the increase in the number of jewelry units sold to fashion jewelry and the increase in average price primarily to sales of higher priced merchandise across all product categories. Included in the $37,617,000 increase is a $21,653,000, or 6%, increase in comparable store sales, a $10,927,000 increase in non-comparable store sales, and a $5,047,000 increase in Internet sales.

In addition, Other includes wholesale sales of diamonds obtained through bulk purchases that were subsequently deemed not suitable for the Company's needs as well as earnings received from third-party licensing agreements. In 2014 , total sales increased $28,511,000 , or 26% , primarily due to retail sales growth in the Emerging Markets region of $20,443,000, reflecting the opening of the first Company-operated TIFFANY & CO. store in Russia and comparable store sales growth of 8%. The remainder of the increase was primarily related to higher wholesale sales of diamonds. In 2013, total sales increased $38,727,000, or 53%, primarily due to retail sales growth in the U.A.E., as well as higher wholesale sales of rough diamonds. Comparable store sales of five TIFFANY & CO. stores in the U.A.E. increased 14% in 2013. Store Data . In 2014 , the Company added a net of 6 stores: three in the Americas (two in the U.S. and one in Mexico), two in Japan, one in Asia-Pacific (in Australia), one in Europe (in France) and one in the Emerging Markets (in Russia) while closing two stores in the Americas. In 2013, the Company added a net of 14 stores: six in the Americas (three in the U.S., one each in Canada, Mexico and Brazil), seven in Asia-Pacific (four in China, two in Taiwan and one in Hong Kong) and three in Europe (two in Italy and one in Germany) while closing one store each in Asia-Pacific and in Japan. Sales per gross square foot generated by all company-operated stores were approximately $3,100 in 2014 , $3,100 in 2013 and $3,000 in 2012. Gross Margin 2014 2013 2012 Gross profit as a percentage of net sales 59.7 % 58.1 % 57.0 % Gross margin (gross profit as a percentage of net sales) increased by 1.6 percentage points in 2014 largely benefiting from favorable product input costs and price increases, and, to some extent, a shift in mix to higher-margin products, especially in the fashion jewelry category. Gross margin increased by 1.1 percentage points in 2013 primarily benefiting from reduced product cost pressures and price increases taken in the first half of the year. A continued shift in sales mix toward higher-priced, lower-margin products offset a portion of these benefits. Management periodically reviews and adjusts its retail prices when appropriate to address product input cost increases, specific market conditions and changes in foreign currencies/U.S. dollar relationships. Its TIFFANY & CO. K- 35 Table of Contents long-term strategy is to continue that approach. Among the market conditions that management considers are consumer demand for the product category involved, which may be influenced by consumer confidence, and competitive pricing conditions. Management uses derivative instruments to mitigate certain foreign exchange and precious metal price exposures (see "Item 8. Financial Statements and Supplementary Data Note H - Hedging Instruments"). Management increased retail prices in both 2014 and 2013 across all geographic regions and product categories. Selling, General and Administrative Expenses 2014 2013 2012 SG&A expenses as a percentage of net sales 38.7 % 38.6 % 38.6 % SG&A expenses increased $89,843,000 , or 6% , in 2014 and $89,836,000, or 6%, in 2013. SG&A expenses in those years are not comparable due to the inclusion of certain expenses associated with specific cost-reduction initiatives in 2013. See "Non-GAAP Measures" for further details. Excluding the 2013 items noted in "Non-GAAP Measures", SG&A expenses in 2014 increased $99,222,000, or 6%, largely reflecting increased marketing expenses of $30,484,000, increased fixed labor costs of $26,019,000 (primarily increased store-related labor costs) and increased store occupancy and depreciation expenses of $22,551,000 (related to new and existing stores). Excluding the 2013 items noted in "Non-GAAP Measures", SG&A expenses in 2013 increased $80,457,000, or 5%, primarily due to increased fixed and variable labor costs (such as sales commissions and incentive compensation) of $34,628,000 and increased store occupancy and depreciation expenses of $32,577,000 (related to new and existing stores). In 2013, changes in foreign currency exchange rates had the effect of decreasing SG&A expenses by 3%. SG&A expenses as a percentage of net sales, excluding the items noted in "Non-GAAP Measures", would have been 38.4% in 2013. The Company's SG&A expenses are largely fixed in nature. Variable costs (which include items such as variable store rent, sales commissions and fees paid to credit card companies) represent approximately one-fifth of total SG&A expenses. Arbitration Award Expense In the fourth quarter of 2013, the Company recorded a charge of $480,211,000, related to the adverse arbitration ruling between The Swatch Group Ltd. and the Company, which includes the damages, interest and other costs associated with the ruling. See "Item 8. Financial Statements and Supplementary Data - Note J - Commitments and Contingencies" for additional information. Earnings from Operations Earnings from operations increased 193% in 2014 and decreased 56% in 2013 primarily due to the impact of the Arbitration Award. Operating margin increased 13.5 percentage points in 2014 and decreased 10.9 percentage points in 2013. Excluding other operating expenses in 2013 (see below), earnings from operations increased 12% and 14% in 2014 and 2013, and operating margin improved 1.3 percentage points in 2014 (due to an increase in gross margin) and 1.3 percentage points in 2013 (primarily due to an increase in gross margin as well as sales leverage on operating expenses).

On a segment basis, the ratio of earnings (losses) from operations to each segment's net sales in 2014 compared with 2013 was as follows: Americas the ratio increased 2.0 percentage points resulting from an improvement in gross margin; Asia-Pacific the ratio increased 1.7 percentage points primarily due to an improvement in gross margin partly offset by increased spending for new and existing stores; Japan the ratio decreased 1.9 percentage points due to a decrease in gross margin (primarily resulting from a reduced benefit from the Company's ongoing program to utilize Yen forward contracts for a portion of forecasted merchandise purchases); Europe the ratio increased 0.2 percentage point due to an improvement in gross margin partly offset by increased spending for new and existing stores; and Other the ratio increased 6.0 percentage points due to an improvement in the performance of retail operations in the Emerging Markets region and lower charges associated with the write-down of wholesale diamond inventory deemed not suitable for the Company's needs. On a segment basis, the ratio of earnings (losses) from operations to each segment's net sales in 2013 compared with 2012 was as follows: Americas the ratio increased 0.6 percentage point resulting from an improvement in gross margin as well as sales leveraging of operating expenses; Asia-Pacific the ratio increased 2.5 percentage points primarily due to an improvement in gross margin as well as sales leveraging of operating expenses; Japan the ratio increased 5.3 percentage points primarily due to an improvement in gross margin (which includes a benefit from the Company's ongoing program to utilize forward contracts for a portion of forecasted merchandise purchases) as well as sales leveraging of operating expenses; TIFFANY & CO. K- 37 Table of Contents Europe the ratio increased 0.5 percentage point due to an improvement in gross margin partly offset by increased store-related operating expenses; and Other the ratio improved 8.0 percentage points due to improvement in the performance of retail operations in the Emerging Markets region partly offset by charges associated with the valuation of wholesale diamonds not suitable for the Company's needs. Unallocated corporate expenses include costs related to administrative support functions which the Company does not allocate to its segments. Such unallocated costs include those for centralized information technology, finance, legal and human resources departments. Unallocated corporate expenses decreased by $3,586,000 in 2014. Such expenses increased by $14,230,000 in 2013 primarily due to increases in management incentive and stock-based compensation. Other operating expenses in 2013 represent $480,211,000 of expenses associated with the adverse arbitration ruling between the Swatch Group Ltd. and the Company and $9,379,000 of expenses associated with specific cost-reduction initiatives. See "Item 8. Financial Statements and Supplementary Data - Note J - Commitments and Contingencies." Interest Expense and Financing Costs Interest expense and financing costs increased $249,000 , or less than 1%, in 2014 . Such expenses increased $3,585,000, or 6%, in 2013, primarily due to increased borrowings. Other Income, Net Other income, net includes interest income, gains/losses on investment activities and foreign currency transactions. Other income, net decreased $10,401,000 , or 79%, in 2014 , and increased $7,763,000, or 143%, in 2013. However, when excluding $7,489,000 of foreign currency transaction gains related to the Arbitration Award expense recorded in 2013, other income, net declined $2,912,000 in 2014 primarily due to other foreign currency transaction losses but increased $274,000 in 2013. See "Item 8. Financial Statements and Supplementary Data - Note J - Commitments and Contingencies" and "Non-GAAP Measures" for further information. Loss on Extinguishment of Debt In 2014, the Company recorded a loss on extinguishment of debt of $93,779,000 associated with the redemption of all of the aggregate principal amount outstanding of the Company's (i) $100,000,000 principal amount of 9.05% Series A Senior Notes due December 23, 2015; (ii) $125,000,000 principal amount of 10.0% Series A-2009 Senior Notes due February 13, 2017; (iii) $50,000,000 principal amount of 10.0% Series A Senior Notes due April 9, 2018; and (iv) $125,000,000 principal amount of 10.0% Series B-2009 Senior Notes due February 13, 2019 (collectively, the "Private Placement Notes") prior to maturity in accordance with the respective note purchase agreements governing each series of Private Placement Notes, which included provisions for make-whole payments in the event of early repayment. Provision for Income Taxes The effective income tax rate was 34.4% in 2014 compared with 28.8% in 2013 and 35.3% in 2012. In 2013, the effective income tax rate would have been 34.8% when excluding the effects of certain expenses noted in "Non-GAAP Measures". TIFFANY & CO. K- 38 Table of Contents LIQUIDITY AND CAPITAL RESOURCES The Company's liquidity needs have been, and are expected to remain, primarily a function of its ongoing, seasonal and expansion-related working capital requirements and capital expenditure needs. Over the long term, the Company manages its cash and capital structure to maintain a strong financial position that provides flexibility to pursue strategic initiatives. Management regularly assesses its working capital needs, capital expenditure requirements, debt service, dividend payouts, share repurchases and future investments. Management believes that cash on hand, internally-generated cash flows, the funds available under its revolving credit facilities and the ability to access the debt and capital markets are sufficient to support the Company's liquidity and capital requirements for the foreseeable future. As of January 31, 2015 , the Company cash and cash equivalents totaled $729,957,000 , of which approximately one-third was held in locations outside the U.S. where the Company has the intention to indefinitely reinvest any undistributed earnings to support its continued expansion and investments outside of the U.S. Such cash balances are not available to fund U.S. cash requirements unless the Company were to decide to repatriate such funds and incur applicable income tax charges. The Company has sufficient sources of cash in the U.S. to fund its U.S. operations without the need to repatriate any of those funds held outside the U.S. The following table summarizes cash flows from operating, investing and financing activities: (in thousands) 2014 2013 2012 Net cash provided by (used in): Operating activities $ 615,117 $ 154,652 $ 328,290 Investing activities (216,989 ) (246,781 ) (331,146 ) Financing activities (23,375 ) (65,426 ) 71,446 Effect of exchange rates on cash and cash equivalents 9,426 (1,505 ) 2,294 Net increase (decrease) in cash and cash equivalents $ 384,179 $ (159,060 ) $ 70,884 Operating Activities The Company had a net cash inflow from operating activities of $615,117,000 in 2014 , $154,652,000 in 2013 and $328,290,000 in 2012 . The change from 2013 to 2014 was primarily due to the improvement in operating performance and the timing of income tax payments and other payables. The change from 2012 to 2013 was impacted by the payment of the Arbitration Award (see "Item 8. Financial Statements and Supplementary Data - Note J - Commitments and Contingencies"), a decelerated rate of inventory growth and the timing of income tax payments. Working Capital. Working capital (current assets less current liabilities) and the corresponding current ratio (current assets divided by current liabilities) were $2,953,354,000 and 5.5 at January 31, 2015 compared with $2,531,648,000 and 4.6 at January 31, 2014 . Accounts receivable, less allowances at January 31, 2015 were 3% higher than at January 31, 2014 due to sales growth. When excluding the effect of foreign currency translation, primarily from the weaker Japanese yen, accounts receivable, less allowances would have been 10% higher than January 31, 2014. On a 12-month rolling basis, accounts receivable turnover was 21 times in 2014 and 22 times in 2013 . Inventories, net at January 31, 2015 were 2% higher than at January 31, 2014 . Finished goods inventories rose 4% to support new store openings and expanded product assortments, while combined raw material and work-in-process inventories decreased 2% . Net inventories rose 6% from January 31, 2014 when excluding the effect of foreign currency translation. TIFFANY & CO. K- 39 Table of Contents Investing Activities The Company had a net cash outflow from investing activities of $216,989,000 in 2014 , $246,781,000 in 2013 and $331,146,000 in 2012 . The decreased outflow in 2014 was due to net proceeds received from the sale of marketable securities and short term investments partly offset by increased capital expenditures. The increased outflow in 2012 was primarily due to payments of $82,664,000 to acquire intangible assets as well as a $25,000,000 payment related to an acquisition. Marketable Securities and Short-Term Investments. The Company invests a portion of its cash in marketable securities and short-term investments. The Company had net proceeds received from the sale of marketable securities and short-term investments of $15,245,000 during 2014 , net purchases of investments in marketable securities and short-term investments of $23,460,000 during 2013 and net proceeds received from the sale of marketable securities of $4,063,000 during 2012. Capital Expenditures. Capital expenditures are typically related to the opening, renovation and/or relocation of stores (which represented approximately half of capital expenditures in 2014 , 2013 and 2012 ), distribution and manufacturing facilities and ongoing investments in information technology. Capital expenditures were $247,394,000 in 2014 , $221,452,000 in 2013 and $219,530,000 in 2012 , representing 6% , 5% and 6% of net sales in those respective years. The increase in 2014 reflected incremental spending for information technology systems and internal manufacturing capacity. Notes Receivable Funded. The Company has extended loans to diamond mining and exploration companies in order to obtain rights to purchase the mine's output. The Company loaned $3,050,000 and $8,015,000 in 2013 and 2012 to various companies. Proceeds from Notes Receivable Funded. In 2014 and 2013, the Company received $15,160,000 and $1,181,000 of repayments associated with loans extended to diamond mining and exploration companies discussed in Notes Receivable Funded above. Payments to acquire intangible assets. In 2012, the Company made a $47,059,000 payment in connection with maintaining an exclusive license for Peretti-designed jewelry and products. The Company also made a $35,605,000 payment to secure a prime retail location in Europe. Payment for acquisition. In 2012, the Company made a $25,000,000 payment related to the acquisition of net assets associated with the five existing independently-operated TIFFANY & CO. stores located in the U.A.E. Financing Activities The Company had net cash outflows from financing activities of $23,375,000 in 2014 and $65,426,000 in 2013 compared with an inflow of $71,446,000 in 2012 . Year-over-year changes in cash flows from financing activities are largely driven by borrowings. Additionally, the Company resumed repurchasing its Common Stock in 2014 under a new share repurchase program after it did not repurchase any of its Common Stock in 2013. TIFFANY & CO. K- 40 Table of Contents Recent Borrowings. The Company had net proceeds from short-term and long-term borrowings as follows: (in thousands) 2014 2013 2012 Short-term borrowings: (Repayments of) proceeds from credit facility borrowings, net $ (12,454 ) $ 49,883 $ 47,278 Proceeds from other credit facility borrowings 19,803 89,806 40,298 Repayments of other credit facility borrowings (3,412 ) (69,737 ) (361 ) Net proceeds from short-term borrowings 3,937 69,952 87,215 Long-term borrowings: Proceeds from issuances 548,037 250,000 Repayments (400,000 ) (60,000 ) Net proceeds from long-term borrowings 148,037 190,000 Net proceeds from total borrowings 151,974 69,952 277,215 Payments of debt extinguishment costs (included in operating activities) (93,378 ) Net proceeds $ 58,596 $ 69,952 $ 277,215 Credit Facilities. In October 2014, Tiffany & Co. entered into a four-year $375,000,000 and a five-year $375,000,000 multi-bank, multi-currency, committed unsecured revolving credit facility, including letter of credit subfacilities (collectively, the "New Credit Facilities"), resulting in a total borrowing capacity of $750,000,000. The New Credit Facilities replaced the previously existing $275,000,000 three-year unsecured revolving credit facility and $275,000,000 five-year unsecured revolving credit facility, which were terminated and repaid concurrently with Tiffany & Co.'s entry into the New Credit Facilities. See "Item 8. Financial Statements and Supplementary Data - Note G - Debt" for additional information. Other Credit Facilities. In July 2013, Tiffany & Co.'s wholly-owned subsidiary, Tiffany & Co. (Shanghai) Commercial Company Limited ("Tiffany-Shanghai"), entered into a three-year multi-bank revolving credit agreement (the "Tiffany-Shanghai Credit Agreement"). The Tiffany-Shanghai Credit Agreement has an aggregate borrowing limit of RMB 930,000,000 ( $148,879,000 at January 31, 2015 ). The Tiffany-Shanghai Credit Agreement is available for Tiffany-Shanghai's general working capital requirements, which included repayment of a portion of the indebtedness under Tiffany-Shanghai's existing bank loan facilities. The six lenders that are party to the Tiffany-Shanghai Credit Agreement will make loans, upon Tiffany-Shanghai's request, for periods of up to 12 months at the applicable interest rates as announced by the People's Bank of China. The Tiffany-Shanghai Credit Agreement matures in July 2016. See "Item 8. Financial Statements and Supplementary Data - Note G - Debt" for additional information. Under all of the Company's credit facilities, there were $234,013,000 of borrowings, $5,671,000 of letters of credit issued but not outstanding and $772,155,000 available for borrowing at January 31, 2015 . The weighted-average interest rate for the amount outstanding at January 31, 2015 was 3.28% compared with 3.37% at January 31, 2014 . Senior Notes. In September 2014, Tiffany & Co. issued $250,000,000 aggregate principal amount of 3.80% Senior Notes due 2024 (the "2024 Notes") and $300,000,000 aggregate principal amount of 4.90% Senior Notes due 2044 (the "2044 Notes" and, together with the 2024 Notes, the "Senior Notes") in a private placement conducted pursuant to Rule 144A and Regulation S under the Securities Act of 1933, as amended. The Senior Notes were issued at a discount with aggregate net proceeds of $548,037,000 (with an effective yield of 3.836% for the 2024 Notes and an effective yield of 4.926% for the 2044 Notes). Tiffany & Co. used the net proceeds from the issuance of the Senior Notes to redeem $400,000,000 in aggregate principal amount of long-term debt prior to their scheduled maturities which TIFFANY & CO. K- 41 Table of Contents ranged from 2015 to 2019 and paid $93,378,000 of debt extinguishment costs associated with the redemption. The Company used the remaining net proceeds from the sale of the Senior Notes for general corporate purposes. See "Item 8. Financial Statements and Supplementary Data - Note G - Debt" for additional information. In 2012, Tiffany & Co. issued $250,000,000 of long-term debt due 2042 at an interest rate of 4.40%. Proceeds were used to repay $60,000,000 of 10-year term, 6.56% Series D Senior Notes that came due in July 2012 and for general corporate purposes. The ratio of total debt (short-term borrowings, current portion of long-term debt and long-term debt) to stockholders' equity was 39% at January 31, 2015 and 37% at January 31, 2014 . At January 31, 2015 , the Company was in compliance with all debt covenants. Share Repurchases. In January 2011, the Company's Board of Directors approved a stock repurchase program ("2011 Program") and terminated a previously-existing program. The 2011 Program authorized the Company to repurchase up to $400,000,000 of its Common Stock through open market or private transactions. The timing of repurchases and the actual number of shares to be repurchased depended on a variety of discretionary factors such as stock price, cash-flow forecasts and other market conditions. The Company suspended share repurchases during the second quarter of 2012 in order to allow for a more effective allocation of resources consistent with the Company's growth strategies. In January 2013, the Board of Directors extended the expiration date of the 2011 Program to January 31, 2014. The 2011 Program expired on January 31, 2014 with $163,794,000 of unused capacity. In March 2014, the Company's Board of Directors approved a share repurchase program which authorizes the Company to repurchase up to $300,000,000 of its Common Stock through open market transactions. Purchases are executed under a written plan for trading securities as specified under Rule 10b5-1 promulgated under the Securities and Exchange Act of 1934, as amended, the terms of which are within the Company's discretion, subject to applicable securities laws, and are based on market conditions and the Company's liquidity needs. The program will expire on March 31, 2017. The Company's share repurchase activity was as follows: (in thousands, except per share amounts) 2014 2013 2012 Cost of repurchases $ 27,028 $ $ 54,107 Shares repurchased and retired 301 813 Average cost per share $ 89.91 $ $ 66.54 At January 31, 2015, $272,972,000 remained available for share repurchases under this authorization. Dividends. The cash dividend on the Company's Common Stock was increased once in each of 2014 , 2013 and 2012 . The Company's Board of Directors declared quarterly dividends which totaled $1.48, $1.34 and $1.25 per common share in 2014 , 2013 and 2012 with cash dividends paid of $191,171,000 , $170,312,000 and $158,594,000 in those respective years. The dividend payout ratio (dividends as a percentage of net earnings) was 39% , 94% and 38% in 2014 , 2013 and 2012 . Dividends as a percentage of adjusted net earnings (see "Non-GAAP Measures") were 35% in 2014 and 2013. At least annually, the Company's Board of Directors reviews its policies with respect to dividends and share repurchases with a view to actual and projected earnings, cash flows and capital requirements. TIFFANY & CO. K- 42 Table of Contents Proceeds from Non-controlling Interest. In 2012, the Company received proceeds of $12,750,000 associated with its venture with Damas Jewellery LLC that acquired the five existing independently-operated TIFFANY & CO. stores located in the U.A.E. as noted in Payment for acquisition above. Contractual Cash Obligations and Commercial Commitments The following is a summary of the Company's contractual cash obligations at January 31, 2015 : (in thousands) Total 2015 2016-2017 2018-2019 Thereafter Unrecorded contractual obligations: Operating leases a $ 1,461,677 $ 237,091 $ 398,344 $ 270,226 $ 556,016 Inventory purchase obligations b 376,202 376,202 Interest on debt c 731,406 36,653 71,853 70,400 552,500 Other contractual obligations d 108,922 78,754 20,049 4,269 5,850 Recorded contractual obligations: Short-term borrowings 234,013 234,013 Long-term debt e 884,470 84,470 800,000 $ 3,796,690 $ 962,713 $ 574,716 $ 344,895 $ 1,914,366 a) Operating lease obligations do not include obligations for contingent rent, property taxes, insurance and maintenance that are required by most lease agreements. Contingent rent for the year ended January 31, 2015 totaled $38,572,000 . See "Item 8. Financial Statements and Supplementary Data - Note J - Commitment and Contingencies" for a discussion of the Company operating leases. b) The Company will, from time to time, secure supplies of rough diamonds by agreeing to purchase a defined portion of a mine's output. Inventory purchase obligations associated with these agreements have been estimated at approximately $160,000,000 for 2015 and included in this table. Purchases beyond 2015 that are contingent upon mine production have been excluded as they cannot be reasonably estimated. c) Excludes interest payments on amounts outstanding under available lines of credit, as the outstanding amounts fluctuate based on the Company's working capital needs. d) Consists primarily of technology licensing and service contracts, fixed royalty commitments, construction-in-progress and packaging supplies. e) Amounts exclude any unamortized discount or premium. The summary above does not include the following items: Cash contributions to the Company's pension plan and cash payments for other postretirement obligations. The Company funds the Qualified Plan's trust in accordance with regulatory limits to provide for current service and for the unfunded benefit obligation over a reasonable period and for current service benefit accruals. To the extent that these requirements are fully covered by assets in the Qualified Plan, the Company may elect not to make any contribution in a particular year. No cash contribution is required in 2015 to meet the minimum funding requirements of the Employee Retirement Income Security Act ("ERISA"). The Company periodically evaluates whether to make discretionary cash contributions to the Qualified Plan, and currently does not anticipate making such contributions in 2015. This expectation is subject to change based on management's assessment of a variety of factors, including, but not limited to, asset performance, interest rates and changes in actuarial assumptions. The Company estimates cash payments for postretirement health-care and life insurance benefit obligations to be $1,734,000 in 2015 . TIFFANY & CO. K- 43 Table of Contents Unrecognized tax benefits at January 31, 2015 of $8,333,000 and accrued interest and penalties of $6,010,000 . The final outcome of tax uncertainties is dependent upon various matters including tax examinations, interpretation of the applicable tax laws or expiration of statutes of limitations. The Company believes that its tax positions comply with applicable tax law and that it has adequately provided for these matters. However, the examinations may result in proposed assessments where the ultimate resolution may result in the Company owing additional taxes. As of January 31, 2015, unrecognized tax benefits are not expected to change materially in the next 12 months. Future developments may result in a change in this assessment. The following is a summary of the Company's outstanding borrowings and available capacity under its credit facilities at January 31, 2015 : (in thousands) Total Capacity Borrowings Outstanding Letters of Credit Issued Available Capacity Four-year revolving credit facility a $ 375,000 $ 25,916 $ $ 349,084 Five-year revolving credit facility b 375,000 66,603 5,671 302,726 Other credit facilities c 261,839 141,494 120,345 $ 1,011,839 $ 234,013 $ 5,671 $ 772,155 a Matures in October 2018. b Matures in October 2019. c Maturities range from 2015 through 2016. In addition, the Company has other available letters of credit and financial guarantees of $72,194,000 of which $24,092,000 was outstanding at January 31, 2015 . Of those available letters of credit and financial guarantees, $59,092,000 expires within one year. Seasonality As a jeweler and specialty retailer, the Company's business is seasonal in nature, with the fourth quarter typically representing approximately one-third of annual net sales and a higher percentage of annual net earnings. Management expects such seasonality to continue. Critical Accounting Estimates The Company's consolidated financial statements have been prepared in accordance with accounting principles generally accepted in the United States of America. These principles require management to make certain estimates and assumptions that affect amounts reported and disclosed in the financial statements and related notes. Actual results could differ from those estimates and the differences could be material. Periodically, the Company reviews all significant estimates and assumptions affecting the financial statements and records any necessary adjustments. The development and selection of critical accounting estimates and the related disclosures below have been reviewed with the Audit Committee of the Company's Board of Directors. The following critical accounting policies that rely on assumptions and estimates were used in the preparation of the Company's consolidated financial statements: Inventory. The Company writes down its inventory for discontinued and slow-moving products. This write-down is equal to the difference between the cost of inventory and its estimated market value, and is based on assumptions about future demand and market conditions. If actual market conditions are less favorable than those projected by management, additional inventory write-downs might be required. The Company has not made any material changes in the accounting methodology used to establish its reserve for discontinued and slow-moving products during the past three years. At January 31, 2015 , a 10% change TIFFANY & CO. K- 44 Table of Contents in the reserve for discontinued and slow-moving products would have resulted in a change of $6,325,000 in inventory and cost of sales. Property, plant and equipment and intangibles assets and key money . The Company reviews its property, plant and equipment and intangibles assets and key money for impairment when management determines that the carrying value of such assets may not be recoverable due to events or changes in circumstances. Recoverability of these assets is evaluated by comparing the carrying value of the asset with estimated future undiscounted cash flows. If the comparisons indicate that the value of the asset is not recoverable, an impairment loss is calculated as the difference between the carrying value and the fair value of the asset and the loss is recognized during that period. The Company did not record any material impairment charges in 2014 , 2013 or 2012 . Goodwill . The Company performs its annual impairment evaluation of goodwill during the fourth quarter of its fiscal year or when circumstances otherwise indicate an evaluation should be performed. A qualitative assessment is first performed for each reporting unit to determine whether it is more-likely-than-not that the fair value of the reporting unit is less than its carrying value. If it is concluded that this is the case, an evaluation, based upon discounted cash flows, is performed and requires management to estimate future cash flows, growth rates and economic and market conditions. The 2014 , 2013 and 2012 evaluations resulted in no impairment charges. Notes receivables and other financing arrangements. The Company has provided financing to diamond mining and exploration companies in order to obtain rights to purchase the mine's output. Management evaluates these financing arrangements for potential impairment by reviewing the parties' financial statements and projections along with business, operational and other economic factors on a periodic basis. If the analyses indicate that the financing receivable is not recoverable, an impairment loss is recognized, in respect to all or a portion of the financing, during that period. The Company did not record any material impairment charges in 2014 , 2013 or 2012 . Income taxes . The Company is subject to income taxes in U.S. federal and state, as well as foreign jurisdictions. The calculation of the Company's tax liabilities involves dealing with uncertainties in the application of complex tax laws and regulations in a multitude of jurisdictions across the Company's global operations. Significant judgments and estimates are required in determining consolidated income tax expense. The Company's income tax expense, deferred tax assets and liabilities and reserves for uncertain tax positions reflect management's best assessment of estimated future taxes to be paid. Foreign and domestic tax authorities periodically audit the Company's income tax returns. These audits often examine and test the factual and legal basis for positions the Company has taken in its tax filings with respect to its tax liabilities, including the timing and amount of deductions and the allocation of income among various tax jurisdictions ("tax filing positions"). Management believes that its tax filing positions are reasonable and legally supportable. However, in specific cases, various tax authorities may take a contrary position. In evaluating the exposures associated with the Company's various tax filing positions, management records reserves using a more-likely-than-not recognition threshold for income tax positions taken or expected to be taken. Earnings could be affected to the extent the Company prevails in matters for which reserves have been established or is required to pay amounts in excess of established reserves. In evaluating the Company's ability to recover its deferred tax assets within the jurisdiction from which they arise, management considers all available evidence. The Company records valuation allowances when management determines it is more likely than not that deferred tax assets will not be realized in the future. Employee benefit plans . The Company maintains several pension and retirement plans, as well as provides certain postretirement health-care and life insurance benefits for retired employees. The Company makes certain assumptions that affect the underlying estimates related to pension and other postretirement TIFFANY & CO. K- 45 Table of Contents costs. Significant changes in interest rates, the market value of securities and projected health-care costs would require the Company to revise key assumptions and could result in a higher or lower charge to earnings. The Company used discount rates of 4.75% to determine 2014 expense for its U.S. Qualified Plan and 5.00% to determine 2014 expense for its Excess Plan/SRIP and postretirement plans. Holding all other assumptions constant, a 0.5% increase in the discount rate would have decreased 2014 pension and postretirement expenses by $5,266,000 and $581,000. A decrease of 0.5% in the discount rate would have increased the 2014 pension and postretirement expenses by $5,827,000 and $353,000. The discount rate is subject to change each year, consistent with changes in the yield on applicable high-quality, long-term corporate bonds. Management selects a discount rate at which pension and postretirement benefits could be effectively settled based on (i) an analysis of expected benefit payments attributable to current employment service and (ii) appropriate yields related to such cash flows. The Company used an expected long-term rate of return on pension plan assets of 7.50% to determine its 2014 pension expense. Holding all other assumptions constant, a 0.5% change in the long-term rate of return would have changed the 2014 pension expense by approximately $1,600,000. The expected long-term rate of return on pension plan assets is selected by taking into account the average rate of return expected on the funds invested or to be invested to provide for the benefits included in the projected benefit obligation. More specifically, consideration is given to the expected rates of return (including reinvestment asset return rates) based upon the plan's current asset mix, investment strategy and the historical performance of plan assets. For postretirement benefit measurement purposes, 7.50% (for pre-age 65 retirees) and 6.50% (for post-age 65 retirees) annual rates of increase in the per capita cost of covered health care were assumed for 2015 . The rates were assumed to decrease gradually to 4.75% by 2023 and remain at that level thereafter. A one-percentage-point increase in the assumed health-care cost trend rate would increase the Company's accumulated postretirement benefit obligation by approximately $6,200,000 for the year ended January 31, 2015. Decreasing the assumed health-care cost trend rate by one-percentage point would decrease the Company's accumulated postretirement benefit obligation by approximately $4,200,000 for the year ended January 31, 2015. A one-percentage-point change in the assumed health-care cost trend rate would not have a significant effect on the Company's aggregate service and interest cost components of the 2014 postretirement expense.

K- 46 Table of Contents 2015 Outlook For the fiscal year ending January 31, 2016, management is forecasting minimal growth in net earnings per diluted share from the $4.20 (excluding the debt extinguishment charge noted in "Non-GAAP Measures") earned in fiscal 2014. This forecast anticipates a decline of approximately 30% in the first quarter net earnings and a more modest decline in the second quarter, followed by expected double-digit percentage net earnings increases in the third and fourth quarters. This forecast is based on the following assumptions, which are approximate and may or may not prove valid, and which should be read in conjunction with "Item 1A. Risk Factors" on page K-13: Worldwide net sales increasing by a mid-single-digit percentage on a constant-exchange-rate basis with sales growth in all regions. The strong U.S. dollar is expected to have an adverse translation effect on sales throughout fiscal 2015 and, therefore, result in a low-single-digit percentage increase for the full year when reported in U.S. dollars. Additionally, worldwide net sales in the first quarter are expected to decline by approximately 10%, as reported in U.S. dollars, primarily due to a difficult comparison to strong sales growth achieved in Japan in last year first quarter and continued softness currently being experienced in the Americas; worldwide net sales are expected to increase by a low-single-digit percentage, as reported in U.S. dollars, in the second quarter. Increasing the number of Company-operated stores by 12-15, net, with the majority of expansion planned in Asia-Pacific and the balance in the Americas and Europe. Selling, general and administrative expenses increasing at a greater rate than sales growth, partly due to expansion and higher marketing expenses. In addition, overall expense growth includes the effect of a noncash increase in employee-benefit-related expenses of $30,000,000, or $0.15 per diluted share after-tax, tied to changes in actuarial assumptions for the Company U.S. pension and postretirement benefit plans. Earnings from operations equal to the prior year. Interest and other expenses, net of $50,000,000. An effective income tax rate equivalent to the prior year. The assumptions for declines in net earnings in the first and second quarters are tied to the sales expectations noted above, and the related effects on gross margin, along with higher marketing spending tied to the launch of the watch collection. Minimal growth in net inventories. Capital expenditures of $260,000,000, versus $247,000,000 last year. Free cash flow exceeding $400,000,000. TIFFANY & CO. K- 47 Table of Contents
