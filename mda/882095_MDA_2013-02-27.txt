ITEM 7. MANAGEMENT'S DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS OF FINANCIAL CONDITION AND RESULTS OF OPERATIONS The following Management's Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations (MD&A) is intended to help the reader understand our results of operations and financial condition. MD&A is provided as a supplement to, and should be read in conjunction with, our audited Consolidated Financial Statements and the accompanying notes to the Consolidated Financial Statements and other disclosures included in this Annual Report on Form 10-K (including the disclosures under Item 1A. Risk Factors ). Our Consolidated Financial Statements have been prepared in accordance with U.S. generally accepted accounting principles and are presented in U.S. dollars. Management Overview Gilead Sciences, Inc. (Gilead, we or us), incorporated in Delaware on June 22, 1987, is a research-based biopharmaceutical company that discovers, develops and commercializes innovative medicines in areas of unmet medical need. With each new discovery and experimental drug candidate, we seek to improve the care of patients suffering from life-threatening diseases around the world. Gilead's primary areas of focus include human immunodeficiency virus (HIV), liver diseases such as hepatitis B virus (HBV) and hepatitis C virus (HCV), serious cardiovascular and respiratory conditions and oncology/inflammation. Headquartered in Foster City, California, we have operations in North America, Europe and Asia. We continue to add to our existing portfolio of products through our internal discovery and clinical development programs and through our product acquisition and in-licensing strategy. Our product portfolio is comprised of Stribild , Complera /Eviplera , Atripla , Truvada , Viread , Hepsera , Emtriva , Letairis , Ranexa , AmBisome , Cayston and Vistide . We have U.S. and international commercial sales operations, with marketing subsidiaries in North America, Europe and Asia. In addition, we also sell and distribute certain products through our corporate partners under royalty-paying collaborative agreements. Business Highlights We continue to advance our pipeline across all therapeutic areas and believe the combination of our existing internal research programs and our recent acquisitions and partnerships will allow us to continue to bring innovative therapies to individuals who are living with unmet medical needs. Below is a summary of our key accomplishments during 2012: completed the $11.05 billion acquisition of Pharmasset, Inc. (Pharmasset), acquired the lead compound now known as sofosbuvir, a nucleotide analog being evaluated for the treatment of HCV infection and accelerated our timeline to develop the first all-oral HCV regimen as a result of the acquisition; expanded worldwide access to Complera/Eviplera, now available in 21 countries; expanded our research and development (R&D) pipeline with over 50 active Phase 3 clinical studies at the end of 2012; submitted marketing applications in the United States and European Union for elvitegravir, an integrase inhibitor for the treatment of HIV-1 infection in treatment-experienced adults, and cobicistat, a pharmacoenhancing or "boosting" agent that increases blood levels to allow once-daily dosing of certain HIV medicines. The U.S. Food and Drug Administration (FDA) has set target review dates of April 2013 under the Prescription Drug User Fee Act; obtained FDA approval for and launched Stribild, our third single tablet regimen for the treatment of HIV in the United States; announced the acquisition of YM Biosciences (YM), which closed in February 2013, and will expand our growing oncology/inflammation pipeline; and obtained FDA approval for once-daily oral Truvada, in combination with safer sex practices, for pre-exposure prophylaxis (PrEP) to reduce the risk of HIV-1 infection among uninfected adults. Outlook 2013 Our operating objectives for 2013 include increasing the market share of our commercial products, continuing to strengthen our pipeline with internally developed and/or externally in-licensed or purchased opportunities and strengthening our key alliances. From an R&D perspective, we will continue advancing our growing product pipeline. Our focus will be on progressing our efforts towards filing marketing applications for sofosbuvir for the treatment of HCV, developing additional innovative HIV single tablet regimens and advancing new product candidates for the treatment of oncology and inflammation diseases. As a result, we expect to move forward on a number of important late-stage clinical studies related to HIV, HCV, oncology and inflammation. 53 From a commercial perspective, we have a number of initiatives to promote the continued growth of our franchises. In the HIV area, the scientific support for earlier diagnosis and treatment, along with the use of single tablet regimens remains compelling both medically and practically. In anticipation of receiving regulatory approval for sofosbuvir, we will begin to build our commercial organization to support the expected launch of this product in 2014. In 2012, we launched Stribild, a single tablet regimen for the treatment of HIV in the United States. In 2013, we expect continued strong uptake of Stribild in the United States. Our marketing application for Stribild is currently being reviewed by the European Medicines Agency, and if approved, we expect to make the product available in the second quarter of 2013. In the HBV area, we will continue to support educational and promotional activities focused on Asian communities in the United States, highlighting the need to screen, diagnose and link patients to care. In the cardiovascular area, we will continue our efforts to raise awareness of Gilead in the pulmonary arterial hypertension and cardiology communities. We are mindful that conditions in the current macroeconomic environment could affect our ability to achieve our goals. Some of the factors that could affect our business include: changes to legislation that may delay or impact funding for ADAPs in the United States, a continuation or worsening of economic conditions in certain key markets, particularly in Europe, patent expirations of competitive products and the launch of generic competitors, continued government pricing pressures internationally and the potential volatility in foreign currency exchange rates. We will continue to monitor these conditions and will adjust our business processes, as appropriate, to attempt to mitigate these risks to our business. We believe the successes we experienced in 2012 have enabled us to continue to build a financially sound business model that will allow us to continue to further expand our commercial and R&D activities and to maintain quality and compliance. As we continue to grow our business, we remain focused on profitable revenue growth and prudent expense management that we believe will enable solid execution of our operating objectives for 2013. Financial Highlights During 2012 , total revenues grew 16% to $9.70 billion , driven by strong underlying demand for our products. Total product sales were $9.40 billion for 2012 , an increase of 16% over 2011 due primarily to growth in our antiviral franchise, which increased 15% to $8.14 billion compared to the prior year. Sales of Letairis, Ranexa and AmBisome together surpassed the $1 billion mark, reaching $1.13 billion , an increase of 20% compared to the prior year. Royalty revenues from our collaborations with corporate partners were $290.5 million , an increase of 8% compared to the prior year. R&D expenses increased 43% to $1.76 billion for 2012 as we progressed and invested in the expansion of our product pipeline. We continued investing in our Phase 3 clinical studies, particularly in liver disease and oncology. Selling, general and administrative (SG&A) expenses were $1.46 billion for 2012 , an increase of $219.1 million or 18% over 2011 , reflective of the ongoing growth of our business and an increase in the pharmaceutical excise tax resulting from U.S. healthcare reform. Net income for 2012 was $2.59 billion or $1.64 per diluted share, a decrease from $2.80 billion or $1.77 per diluted share in 2011 , primarily due to the continued progression and investment of our product pipeline, and an increase in our effective tax rate resulting from a shift in our geographic mix of earnings, expiration of the federal research tax credit and an increase in acquisition-related expenses for which we receive no tax benefit. At December 31, 2012 , cash, cash equivalents and marketable securities totaled $2.58 billion , a decrease from $9.96 billion as of December 31, 2011 . In January 2012, we completed the Pharmasset acquisition which we financed with approximately $5.20 billion in cash on hand, $3.70 billion in senior unsecured notes issued in December 2011 and $2.15 billion in bank debt issued in January 2012. We generated over $3.19 billion in operating cash flows during 2012, some of which we used to repay approximately $1.84 billion in debt financing and repurchase and retire shares of our common stock for $666.9 million . 54 Results of Operations Total Revenues Total revenues include product sales, royalty revenues, and contract and other revenues. Total revenues were $9.70 billion in 2012 , $8.39 billion in 2011 and $7.95 billion in 2010 . Increases in total revenues were driven by growth in product sales. Product Sales Total product sales were $9.40 billion in 2012 , an increase of 16% over total product sales of $8.10 billion in 2011 , primarily driven by continued growth in sales of antiviral products, including Atripla, Truvada and Complera/Eviplera. The increase also reflected sales growth in other products, primarily Letairis, Ranexa and AmBisome, which reached $1.13 billion in 2012 compared to $943.6 million in 2011 . Total product sales increased by 10% in 2011 compared to $7.39 billion in 2010 , primarily driven by the growth of Atripla and Truvada. More than 40% of our product sales are generated outside the United States and as a result, we face exposure to adverse movements in foreign currency exchange rates, primarily in Euro. We used foreign currency exchange forward contracts to hedge a percentage of our foreign currency exposure. Foreign currency exchange, net of hedges, had an unfavorable impact of $57.1 million on our 2012 revenues compared to 2011 and a favorable impact of $21.4 million on our 2011 revenues compared to 2010 . Product sales in the United States increased 22% for 2012 to $5.54 billion compared to $4.55 billion in 2011 , primarily driven by higher underlying demand for our antiviral products and the launch of Stribild in August 2012. Product sales in other therapeutic areas also contributed to the growth. Letairis sales totaled $410.1 million in 2012 , an increase of 40% compared to 2011 . Ranexa sales totaled $372.9 million in 2012 , an increase of 17% compared to 2011 . AmBisome sales totaled $346.6 million in 2012 , an increase of 5% compared to 2011 . Product sales in Europe increased 6% for 2012 to $3.14 billion compared to $2.97 billion in 2011 , primarily driven by higher underlying demand in our antiviral franchise. Antiviral product sales in Europe totaled $2.87 billion in 2012 , an increase of 6% compared to $2.71 billion in 2011 , primarily driven by the sales of Atripla and Truvada. Foreign currency exchange, net of hedges, had an unfavorable impact of $68.9 million on our European product sales in 2012 compared to 2011 . Total product sales are expected to grow in 2013, as we realize the full year impact of sales of Stribild and continued growth of Complera/Eviplera and products in our cardiovascular franchise. We believe this growth could be tempered by uncertainty around the timing of approval of the U.S. federal budget, the possibility of an automatic reduction in federal spending, or "sequestration" in March 2013, the unavailability or delay in AIDS Drug Assistance Programs (ADAP) funding and the challenging economic environment in Europe. Our results are also subject to continued potential volatility in foreign currency exchange rates. The following table summarizes the period over period changes in our product sales (in thousands): 2012 Change 2011 Change 2010 Antiviral products: Atripla $ 3,574,483 11 % $ 3,224,518 10 % $ 2,926,579 Truvada 3,181,110 11 % 2,875,141 8 % 2,649,908 Viread 848,697 15 % 737,867 1 % 732,240 Complera/Eviplera 342,200 783 % 38,747 % Stribild 57,536 % % Hepsera 108,315 (25 )% 144,679 (28 )% 200,592 Emtriva 29,449 2 % 28,764 4 % 27,679 Total antiviral products 8,141,790 15 % 7,049,716 8 % 6,536,998 Letairis 410,054 40 % 293,426 22 % 240,279 Ranexa 372,949 17 % 320,004 33 % 239,832 AmBisome 346,646 5 % 330,156 8 % 305,856 Other 126,932 16 % 109,057 63 % 66,956 Total product sales $ 9,398,371 16 % $ 8,102,359 10 % $ 7,389,921 55 Antiviral Products Antiviral product sales increased by 15% in 2012 compared to 2011 and 8% in 2011 compared to 2010 . Atripla In 2012 , Atripla sales were driven primarily by sales volume growth in the United States. In 2011 , Atripla sales were driven primarily by sales volume growth in Europe and the United States. Atripla sales accounted for 44% , 46% and 45% of our total antiviral product sales for 2012 , 2011 and 2010 , respectively. The efavirenz component of Atripla, which has a gross margin of zero, comprised $1.34 billion, $1.21 billion and $1.07 billion of our Atripla sales in 2012 , 2011 and 2010 , respectively. Truvada In 2012 , Truvada sales were driven primarily by sales volume growth in the United States. In 2011 , Truvada sales were driven primarily by sales volume growth in Europe and the United States. Truvada sales accounted for 39% , 41% and 41% of our total antiviral product sales for 2012 , 2011 and 2010 , respectively. Complera/Eviplera In 2012 , sales of Complera/Eviplera increased primarily due to sales volume growth in the United States. Complera was approved in the United States in August 2011, and Eviplera was approved in the European Union in November 2011. Stribild Stribild was approved in the United States in August 2012. Other Product Sales Other products, which include Letairis, Ranexa and AmBisome increased due primarily to sales volume growth. Since the label update in March 2011, sales of Letairis have continued to grow as a result of higher enrollments, increasing by 40% in 2012 and 22% in 2011 . AmBisome product sales in the United States and Canada relate solely to our sales of AmBisome to Astellas Pharma US, Inc. which are recorded at our manufacturing cost. Royalty Revenues The following table summarizes the period over period changes in our royalty revenues (in thousands): 2012 Change 2011 Change 2010 Royalty revenues $ 290,523 8 % $ 268,827 (51 )% $ 545,970 Royalty revenues increased 8% for 2012 compared to 2011 , driven primarily by higher royalty revenues from GlaxoSmithKline, Japan Tobacco and Astellas partially offset by lower Tamiflu royalties from Roche. Since the second quarter of 2010, Tamiflu royalties have been decreasing due to the decline in flu planning initiatives worldwide. In 2011 and 2010, our most significant source of royalty revenues was sales of Tamiflu by Roche. Royalty revenues declined 51% for 2011 compared to 2010 , due primarily to lower Tamiflu royalties from Roche. Tamiflu royalties from Roche contributed $43.7 million, $75.5 million and $386.5 million to total royalty revenues in 2012 , 2011 and 2010 respectively. We recognize royalties on Tamiflu sales by Roche in the quarter following the quarter in which the corresponding sales occur. Cost of Goods Sold and Product Gross Margin The following table summarizes the period over period changes in our product sales (in thousands), cost of goods sold (in thousands) and product gross margin: 2012 Change 2011 Change 2010 Total product sales $ 9,398,371 16 % $ 8,102,359 10 % $ 7,389,921 Cost of goods sold $ 2,471,363 16 % $ 2,124,410 14 % $ 1,869,876 Product gross margin 74 % 74 % 75 % Our product gross margin for 2012 was consistent with our product gross margin for 2011 . Our product gross margin for 2011 was 74% , a decrease of 1% compared to 2010, due primarily to an annual selling price adjustment for the percentage share of Atripla that is paid to our partner on the efavirenz component. 56 Research and Development Expenses 2012 Change 2011 Change 2010 Research and development $ 1,759,945 43 % $ 1,229,151 15 % $ 1,072,930 We manage our R&D expenses by identifying the R&D activities we anticipate will be performed during a given period and then prioritizing efforts based on scientific data, probability of successful development, market potential, available human and capital resources and other considerations. We continually review our R&D pipeline and the status of development and, as necessary, reallocate resources among the R&D portfolio that we believe will best support the future growth of our business. R&D expenses summarized above consist primarily of clinical studies performed by contract research organizations (CROs), materials and supplies, licenses and fees, milestone payments under collaboration arrangements, personnel costs, including salaries, benefits and stock-based compensation and overhead allocations consisting of various support and facilities-related costs. The following table provides a breakout of R&D expenses by major cost type (in thousands): 2012 2011 2010 Clinical studies and outside services $ 828,278 $ 570,302 $ 375,228 Personnel expenses 686,091 412,463 384,488 Facilities, IT and other costs 245,576 219,756 177,214 IPR&D impairment charges 26,630 136,000 Total $ 1,759,945 $ 1,229,151 $ 1,072,930 Compared to 2011 , in 2012 , clinical studies and outside services increased $258.0 million due to progression and expansion of our Phase 3 studies, particularly in liver disease and oncology, and personnel expenses increased $273.6 million due to higher headcount to support our product pipeline and study progression. Compared to 2010 , in 2011 , clinical studies and outside services increased $195.1 million due to study progression in liver disease and HIV, new investments in oncology and inflammation and new in-license agreements, milestones and ongoing collaborations; personnel expenses increased $28.0 million due to higher headcount; and facilities, IT and other costs increased $42.5 million to support the ongoing growth of our business. This increase was partially offset by a $109.4 million decrease in IPR&D impairment charges. During 2011, we recorded $26.6 million of impairment charges related to certain IPR&D assets acquired from CGI Pharmaceuticals, Inc. (CGI). These impairment charges were a result of changes in the anticipated market share related to the Syk compound. During 2010, we recorded $136.0 million of impairment charges related to certain IPR&D assets acquired from CV Therapeutics, Inc. The majority of the impairment charge related to our GS-9667 program, a product candidate that was in Phase 1 clinical studies for the treatment of diabetes and hypertriglyceridemia, which was terminated in the fourth quarter of 2010 due to unfavorable results from pharmacokinetics and pharmacodynamics tests that demonstrated limited effectiveness of the compound in patients. In 2013, we expect R&D expenses to increase over 2012 levels due to continued investment in our internal and collaborative R&D efforts and advancement of our product pipeline, driven primarily by the progression of our Phase 3 clinical studies in the liver disease and oncology areas. Selling, General and Administrative Expenses 2012 Change 2011 Change 2010 Selling, general and administrative $ 1,461,034 18 % $ 1,241,983 19 % $ 1,044,392 SG&A expenses relate to sales and marketing, finance, human resources, legal and other administrative activities. Expenses are primarily comprised of facilities and overhead costs; outside marketing, advertising and legal expenses and other general and administrative costs. Compared to 2011 , in 2012 , SG&A expenses increased $219.1 million or 18% . The increase was due primarily to a $100.5 million increase in costs associated with the growth of our business which include personnel and headcount-related expenses, a $98.0 million increase in stock-based compensation expenses primarily resulting from the acquisition of 57 Pharmasset and an increase of $38.2 million in the pharmaceutical excise tax resulting from U.S. healthcare reform. This increase was partially offset by a reduction in bad debt provisions of $34.3 million, which included a gain of $29.9 million related to the sale of our accounts receivables balances in Spain in the second quarter of 2012. Compared to 2010 , in 2011 , SG&A expenses increased $197.6 million or 19% , due primarily to increased contract, legal and other professional services of $86.8 million, pharmaceutical excise tax of $47.3 million, increased compensation and benefits expenses of $41.6 million as a result of higher headcount to support our expanding commercial activities, promotional costs of $20.1 million driven by our expanding sales and marketing activities and bad debt provisions of $14.7 million associated with slower collections in southern European countries. In 2013, we expect SG&A expenses to increase over 2012 to support the expansion of our business including the pre-launch activities in preparation for the anticipated NDA filing of sofosbuvir in the first half of 2013 and an increase in the pharmaceutical excise tax. We also expect bad debt provisions to return to historical levels as 2012 included significant collections of past due accounts receivable in Spain and Portugal, that we do not expect to occur in 2013. Interest Expense Compared to 2011 , in 2012 , interest expense increased to $360.9 million . The increase was due primarily to the additional debt we issued in connection with our acquisition of Pharmasset, which included $3.70 billion in senior unsecured notes issued in December 2011 and $2.15 billion in bank debt issued in January 2012. Compared to 2010 , in 2011 , interest expense increased to $205.4 million . The increase in interest expense was due primarily to the issuance of our convertible senior notes for $2.50 billion in July 2010, the issuance of our senior unsecured notes for $1.00 billion in March 2011, and the issuance of our senior unsecured notes for $3.70 billion in December 2011. This increase was partially offset by the maturity of our convertible senior notes due in May 2011, which had an aggregate principal balance of $650.0 million. Other Income (Expense), Net For 2012 , other income (expense), net was a net expense of $(37.3) million compared to income of $66.6 million and $60.3 million in 2011 and 2010 , respectively. The decrease in other income (expense), net, in 2012 compared to 2011 was due primarily to decreased interest income resulting from lower cash and marketable securities balances and yields and a $40.1 million loss on Greek bonds related to Greece's restructuring of its sovereign debt in the first quarter of 2012. The increase in other income (expense), net, in 2011 compared to 2010 was driven primarily by a favorable net foreign currency exchange impact and an increase in interest income, partially offset by an increase in costs related to our hedging activities. Provision for Income Taxes Our provision for income taxes was $1.04 billion , $861.9 million and $1.02 billion in 2012 , 2011 and 2010 , respectively. The 2012 effective tax rate of 28.7% differed from the U.S. federal statutory rate of 35% due primarily to tax credits and certain operating earnings from non-U.S. subsidiaries that are considered indefinitely reinvested, partially offset by state taxes, the stock-based compensation expense related to the Pharmasset acquisition and contingent consideration expense related to certain acquisitions for which we receive no tax benefit. We do not provide for U.S. income taxes on undistributed earnings of our foreign operations that are intended to be indefinitely reinvested in our foreign subsidiaries. The 2011 effective tax rate of 23.6% differed from the U.S. federal statutory rate of 35% due primarily to tax credits and certain operating earnings from non-U.S. subsidiaries that are considered indefinitely reinvested, partially offset by state taxes and the non-deductible pharmaceutical excise tax. The 2010 effective tax rate of 26.2% differed from the U.S. federal statutory rate of 35% due primarily to tax credits and certain operating earnings from non-U.S. subsidiaries that are considered indefinitely reinvested, partially offset by state taxes. In January 2013, the U.S. Congress passed the American Taxpayer Relief Act of 2012 which retroactively reinstated the federal research tax credit for 2012 and 2013. As a result, our income tax provision for the first quarter of 2013 will include a discrete tax benefit related to the federal research tax credit for 2012 which will reduce our effective tax rate for the quarter and to a lesser extent, the annual effective tax rate. 58 Acquisition of Pharmasset In January 2012, we completed the acquisition of Pharmasset, a publicly-held clinical-stage pharmaceutical company committed to discovering, developing and commercializing novel drugs to treat viral infections. Pharmasset's primary focus was the development of oral therapeutics for the treatment of HCV infection. Pharmasset's lead compound, now known as sofosbuvir (formally known as GS-7977), is a nucleotide analog which, as of January 2012, was being evaluated in Phase 2 and Phase 3 clinical studies for the treatment of HCV infection across genotypes. We believe the acquisition of Pharmasset provides us with an opportunity to complement our existing HCV portfolio and helps advance our effort to develop all-oral regimens for the treatment of HCV. We acquired all of the outstanding shares of common stock of Pharmasset for $137 per share in cash through a tender offer and subsequent merger under the terms of an agreement and plan of merger entered into in November 2011. The aggregate cash payment to acquire all of the outstanding shares of common stock was $11.05 billion. We financed the transaction with approximately $5.20 billion in cash on hand, $3.70 billion in senior unsecured notes issued in December 2011 and $2.15 billion in bank debt issued in January 2012. The Pharmasset acquisition was accounted for as a business combination. The results of operations of Pharmasset have been included in our Consolidated Statement of Income since January 13, 2012, the date on which we acquired approximately 88% of the outstanding shares of common stock of Pharmasset, cash consideration was transferred, and as a result, we obtained effective control of Pharmasset. The acquisition was completed on January 17, 2012 , at which time Pharmasset became a wholly-owned subsidiary of Gilead and was integrated into our operations. As we do not track earnings results by product candidate or therapeutic area, we do not maintain separate earnings results for the acquired Pharmasset business. The following table summarizes the components of the cash paid to acquire Pharmasset (in thousands): Total consideration transferred $ 10,858,372 Stock-based compensation expense 193,937 Total cash paid $ 11,052,309 The $11.05 billion cash payment consisted of a $10.38 billion cash payment to the outstanding common stockholders as well as a $668.3 million cash payment to option holders under the Pharmasset stock option plans. The $10.38 billion cash payment to the outstanding common stockholders and $474.3 million of the cash payment to vested option holders under the Pharmasset stock option plans were accounted for as consideration transferred. The remaining $193.9 million of cash payment was accounted for as stock-based compensation expense resulting from the accelerated vesting of Pharmasset employee options immediately prior to the acquisition. The following table summarizes the acquisition date fair values of assets acquired and liabilities assumed, and the consideration transferred (in thousands): Identifiable intangible assets $ 10,738,000 Cash and cash equivalents 106,737 Other assets acquired (liabilities assumed), net (43,182 ) Total identifiable net assets 10,801,555 Goodwill 56,817 Total consideration transferred $ 10,858,372 59 Identifiable Intangible Assets We acquired intangible assets, primarily comprised of the sofosbuvir in-process research and development (IPR&D) compound, which had an estimated fair value of $10.72 billion as of the date of acquisition. The fair value was determined using a probability-weighted income approach that discounts expected future cash flows to present value. The estimated net cash flows were discounted using a discount rate of 12% , which is based on the estimated weighted-average cost of capital for companies with profiles similar to that of Pharmasset. This rate is comparable to the estimated internal rate of return for the acquisition and represents the rate that market participants would use to value the intangible asset. The projected cash flows were based on key assumptions such as: estimates of revenues and operating profits related to each project considering its stage of development on the acquisition date; the time and resources needed to complete the development and approval of the product candidate; the life of the potential commercialized product and associated risks, including the inherent difficulties and uncertainties in developing a product candidate such as obtaining marketing approval from the FDA and other regulatory agencies; and risks related to the viability of and potential alternative treatments in any future target markets. Intangible assets related to IPR&D projects are considered to be indefinite-lived assets and are not amortized until the completion or abandonment of the associated R&D efforts. Goodwill The $56.8 million of goodwill represents the excess of the consideration transferred over the fair values of assets acquired and liabilities assumed and is attributable to the synergies expected from combining our R&D operations with Pharmasset's. None of the goodwill is expected to be deductible for income tax purposes. Stock-Based Compensation Expense The stock-based compensation expense recognized for the accelerated vesting of employee options immediately prior to the acquisition was reported in our Consolidated Statement of Income as follows (in thousands): Year Ended December 31, 2012 Research and development expense $ 100,149 Selling, general and administrative expense 93,788 Total stock-based compensation expense $ 193,937 Other Costs Other costs incurred in connection with the acquisition include (in thousands): Year Ended December 31, 2012 2011 Transaction costs (e.g. investment advisory, legal and accounting fees) $ 10,635 $ 28,461 Bridge financing costs 7,333 23,817 Restructuring costs 15,125 Total other costs $ 33,093 $ 52,278 The following table summarizes these costs by the line item in the Consolidated Statement of Income in which these costs were recognized (in thousands): Year Ended December 31, 2012 2011 Research and development expense $ 7,906 $ Selling, general and administrative expense 17,854 28,461 Interest expense 7,333 23,817 Total other costs $ 33,093 $ 52,278 60 Liquidity and Capital Resources We believe that our existing capital resources, supplemented by our cash flows generated from operating activities, as well as cash flow from financing activities will be adequate to satisfy our capital needs for the foreseeable future. Our cash, cash equivalents and marketable securities decreased significantly in 2012 as we completed our acquisition of Pharmasset in January 2012. The following table summarizes our cash, cash equivalents and marketable securities, our working capital and our cash flow activities as of the end of, and for each of, the periods presented (in thousands): 2012 2011 2010 As of December 31: Cash, cash equivalents and marketable securities $ 2,582,086 $ 9,963,972 $ 5,318,071 Working capital $ 1,886,327 $ 11,403,995 $ 3,243,132 Year Ended December 31: Cash provided by (used in): Operating activities $ 3,194,716 $ 3,639,010 $ 2,833,913 Investing activities $ (11,846,054 ) $ 3,589,845 $ (1,937,751 ) Financing activities $ 563,346 $ 1,763,569 $ (1,338,710 ) Cash, Cash Equivalents and Marketable Securities Cash, cash equivalents and marketable securities totaled $2.58 billion at December 31, 2012 , a decrease of $7.38 billion or 74% from December 31, 2011 primarily due to our acquisition of Pharmasset for $11.05 billion in January 2012. During 2012, we generated $3.19 billion in cash flows from operations. Cash, cash equivalents and marketable securities totaled $9.96 billion at December 31, 2011 , an increase of $4.65 billion or 87% from December 31, 2010 . This increase was primarily attributable to the issuance of our senior unsecured notes in 2011 for total net proceeds of $4.66 billion and cash provided by operations of $3.64 billion. This increase was partially offset by $2.38 billion used to repurchase our common stock under our stock repurchase programs, $650.0 million used to repay our convertible senior notes due in May 2011 and $588.6 million used in our acquisitions of Arresto Biosciences, Inc. and Calistoga Pharmaceuticals, Inc. The $3.70 billion in net proceeds related to our senior unsecured notes issued in December 2011 and $2.15 billion in additional bank debt issued in January 2012 were used to fund our $11.05 billion acquisition of Pharmasset. Of the total cash, cash equivalents and marketable securities at December 31, 2012 , approximately $1.73 billion was generated from operations in foreign jurisdictions and is intended for use in our foreign operations. We do not rely on unrepatriated earnings as a source of funds for our domestic business as we expect to have sufficient cash flow and borrowing capacity in the United States to fund our domestic operational and strategic needs. Working Capital Working capital was $1.89 billion at December 31, 2012 . The decrease of $9.52 billion from working capital as of December 31, 2011 was primarily attributable to $11.05 billion in cash used for the Pharmasset acquisition and an increase in short-term debt of $1.17 billion related to the current portion of the bank debt issued to finance the Pharmasset acquisition and the current portion of our convertible senior notes due in May 2013. Working capital was $11.40 billion at December 31, 2011 , an increase of $8.16 billion from working capital as of December 31, 2010 . This increase was primarily attributable to an increase of $7.80 billion in cash, cash equivalents and short-term marketable securities resulting from the $3.67 billion net issuance of senior unsecured notes in December 2011 and sales of long-term marketable securities in anticipation of the acquisition of Pharmasset. Cash Provided by Operating Activities Cash provided by operating activities of $3.19 billion in 2012 primarily related to net income of $2.57 billion, adjusted for non-cash items such as $278.2 million of depreciation and amortization expenses, $208.7 million of stock-based compensation expenses, $177.1 million of net cash inflow related to changes in operating assets and liabilities and $112.6 million of tax benefits from employee stock plans. Cash provided by operating activities of $3.64 billion in 2011 primarily related to net income of $2.79 billion, adjusted for non-cash items such as $302.2 million of depreciation and amortization expenses, $220.3 million of net cash inflow related to changes in operating assets and liabilities and $192.4 million of stock-based compensation expenses. 61 Cash provided by operating activities of $2.83 billion in 2010 primarily related to net income of $2.89 billion, adjusted for non-cash items such as $265.5 million of depreciation and amortization expenses, $200.0 million of stock-based compensation expenses, $136.0 million of IPR&D impairment expenses and $82.1 million of tax benefits from employee stock plans, partially offset by $680.4 million of net cash outflow related to changes in operating assets and liabilities. Cash Provided by (Used in) Investing Activities Cash used in investing activities in 2012 was $11.85 billion , consisting primarily of $10.75 billion used for our acquisition of Pharmasset, net of the stock-based compensation expense and cash acquired, $672.4 million of net purchases of marketable securities and $397.0 million of capital expenditures, related primarily to the purchase of an office building for $180.0 million and a $155.7 million increase in construction in progress associated with new facilities at our headquarters to support the ongoing growth of our business. Cash provided by investing activities in 2011 was $3.59 billion , consisting of $4.31 billion of net proceeds related to the sales of marketable securities in connection with our acquisition of Pharmasset, partially offset by $588.6 million used in our acquisitions of Arresto and Calistoga and $131.9 million of capital expenditures. Cash used in investing activities in 2010 was $1.94 billion , driven by $1.78 billion of net purchases of marketable securities, $91.0 million used in our acquisition of CGI and $61.9 million of capital expenditures. Cash Provided by (Used in) Financing Activities Cash provided by financing activities in 2012 was $563.3 million , driven primarily by net proceeds of $2.14 billion from the issuance of bank debt in conjunction with the Pharmasset acquisition, proceeds of $466.3 million from issuances of common stock under our employee stock plans and $213.9 million from proceeds received related to our convertible note hedges. The cash proceeds were partially offset by the $1.84 billion used to repay debt financing during the year and $667.0 million used to repurchase common stock under our stock repurchase programs, including commissions. With the upcoming maturity of the May 2013 convertible notes, we will be suspending our share repurchase activity during the first half of 2013. Cash provided by financing activities in 2011 was $1.76 billion , driven primarily by the issuance of $4.66 billion in senior unsecured notes, of which $3.67 billion was raised in December 2011 to partially fund the Pharmasset acquisition, net of issuance costs, and $211.7 million in proceeds from issuances of common stock under our employee stock plans. The cash proceeds were partially offset by $2.38 billion used to repurchase our common stock under our stock repurchase programs, including commissions and $650.0 million used to repay our convertible senior notes due in May 2011. Cash used in financing activities in 2010 was $1.34 billion , driven primarily by the $4.02 billion used to repurchase our common stock under our stock repurchase programs and $362.6 million used to purchase note hedges related to our convertible senior notes due in May 2014 and May 2016. The cash outflows were partially offset by $2.46 billion in net proceeds from the issuance of such notes, $221.2 million in proceeds from issuances of common stock under our employee stock plans and $155.4 million in proceeds from the sale of warrants related to such notes. Long-Term Obligations Bank Debt In January 2012, in conjunction with our acquisition of Pharmasset, we entered into a five-year $1.25 billion revolving credit facility credit agreement (the Five-Year Revolving Credit Agreement), a $750.0 million short-term revolving credit facility credit agreement (the Short-Term Revolving Credit Agreement) and a $1.00 billion term loan facility (the Term Loan Credit Agreement). We borrowed an aggregate principal amount of $2.15 billion as follows: $750.0 million under the Five-Year Revolving Credit Agreement, $400.0 million under the Short-Term Revolving Credit Agreement and $1.00 billion under the Term Loan Credit Agreement, upon the close of the acquisition. In 2012, we fully repaid the $1.40 billion outstanding debt under the Term Loan Credit Agreement and the Short-Term Revolving Credit Agreement, at which time both agreements terminated. The Five-Year Revolving Credit Agreement contains customary representations, warranties, affirmative, negative and financial maintenance covenants and events of default. The loan bears interest at either (i) the Eurodollar Rate plus the Applicable Margin or (ii) the Base Rate plus the Applicable Margin, each as defined in the credit agreement. We may reduce the commitments and may prepay the loan in whole or in part at any time without premium or penalty. The Five-Year Revolving Credit Agreement was inclusive of a $30.0 million swing line loan sub-facility and a $25.0 million letter of credit sub-facility. As of December 31, 2012 , we had $7.3 million in letters of credit outstanding under the 62 Five-Year Revolving Credit Agreement. The Five-Year Revolving Credit Agreement will terminate and all amounts owed under the agreement shall be due and payable on January 12, 2017. Convertible Senior Notes and Senior Unsecured Notes In 2012, a portion of our convertible notes due in May 2013 were converted and we repaid $223.3 million of the principal balance. We also paid $213.9 million in cash related to the conversion spread on these notes, which represents the conversion value in excess of the principal amount, and received $213.9 million in cash from our convertible note hedges related to these notes. In December 2011, we issued senior unsecured notes in a registered offering for an aggregate principal amount of $3.70 billion to partially fund our acquisition of Pharmasset. We pay interest on the notes at fixed annual rates ranging from 2.40% to 5.65%. Also, during 2011, our convertible senior notes due in May 2011 matured and we repaid the aggregate principal balance of $650.0 million. We also paid $36.1 million in cash related to the conversion spread of our matured notes, which represent the conversion value in excess of the principal amount, and received $36.1 million in cash from the related convertible note hedges. Warrants related to our convertible senior notes due in May 2011 expired in August 2011. In March 2011, we issued senior unsecured notes due in April 2021 in a registered offering for an aggregate principal amount of $1.00 billion. The notes pay interest at a fixed annual rate of 4.50%. As of December 31, 2012, our debt-to-EBITDA ratio was 1.9x. During 2012, we repaid $1.84 billion in debt financing and in 2013, we plan to continue to repay our debt to further decrease our debt-to-EBITDA ratio. The following is a summary of our borrowings under various financing arrangements (in thousands): Interest December 31, Type of Borrowing Description Issue Date Due Date Rate 2012 2011 Convertible Senior May 2013 Notes April 2006 May 2013 0.625% $ 419,433 $ 607,036 Convertible Senior May 2014 Notes July 2010 May 2014 1.00% 1,210,213 1,181,525 Convertible Senior May 2016 Notes July 2010 May 2016 1.625% 1,157,692 1,132,293 Senior Unsecured April 2021 Notes March 2011 April 2021 4.50% 992,923 992,066 Senior Unsecured December 2014 Notes December 2011 December 2014 2.40% 749,394 749,078 Senior Unsecured December 2016 Notes December 2011 December 2016 3.05% 699,095 698,864 Senior Unsecured December 2021 Notes December 2011 December 2021 4.40% 1,247,428 1,247,138 Senior Unsecured December 2041 Notes December 2011 December 2041 5.65% 997,810 997,734 Credit Facility Five-Year Revolver January 2012 January 2017 Variable 750,000 Total debt, net $ 8,223,988 $ 7,605,734 Less current portion 1,169,433 Total long-term debt, net $ 7,054,555 $ 7,605,734 We believe our existing capital resources, supplemented by cash generated from our operations, will be adequate to satisfy our capital needs for the foreseeable future. Our future capital requirements will depend on many factors, including but not limited to the following: the commercial performance of our current and future products; the progress and scope of our R&D efforts, including preclinical studies and clinical trials; the cost, timing and outcome of regulatory reviews; the expansion of our sales and marketing capabilities; administrative expenses; the possibility of acquiring additional manufacturing capabilities or office facilities; the possibility of acquiring other companies or new products; costs associated with the settlement and conversion of our convertible senior notes and related warrants; the establishment of additional collaborative relationships with other companies; and costs associated with the defense, settlement and adverse results of litigation and government investigations. 63 We may in the future require additional funding, which could be in the form of proceeds from equity or debt financings. If such funding is required, we cannot guarantee that it will be available to us on favorable terms, if at all. Critical Accounting Policies, Estimates and Judgments The discussion and analysis of our financial condition and results of operations is based on our Consolidated Financial Statements, which have been prepared in accordance with U.S. generally accepted accounting principles. The preparation of these financial statements requires us to make estimates and judgments that affect the reported amounts of assets, liabilities, revenues and expenses and related disclosures. On an ongoing basis, we evaluate our estimates, including those related to revenue recognition, allowance for doubtful accounts, valuation of intangible assets and contingent consideration liabilities resulting from a business combination and our tax provision. We base our estimates on historical experience and on various other market specific and other relevant assumptions that we believe to be reasonable under the circumstances, the results of which form the basis for making judgments about the carrying values of assets and liabilities that are not readily apparent from other sources. Actual results may differ significantly from these estimates. We believe the following critical accounting policies reflect the more significant judgments and estimates used in the preparation of our Consolidated Financial Statements. Revenue Recognition Product Sales We recognize revenues from product sales when there is persuasive evidence that an arrangement exists, delivery to the customer has occurred, the price is fixed or determinable and collectability is reasonably assured. We record estimated reductions to revenues for government rebates such as Medicaid reimbursements, customer incentives such as cash discounts for prompt payment, distributor fees and expected returns of expired products. These estimates are deducted from gross product sales at the time such revenues are recognized. Of these reductions from gross product sales, government rebates significantly impact our reported net product sales and are based upon certain estimates that require complex and significant judgment by management. Government Rebates Allowances and Accrued Government Rebates We estimate reductions to our revenues for government-managed Medicaid programs as well as to certain other qualifying federal, state and foreign government programs for the reimbursement of portions of the retail price of prescriptions filled that are covered by these programs. These reductions are settled either by us being invoiced directly or through charge-backs from our wholesalers. Government rebates that are invoiced directly to us are recorded in accrued government rebates on our Consolidated Balance Sheets. For qualified programs that can purchase our products through wholesalers at a lower contractual government price, the wholesalers charge back to us the difference between their acquisition cost and the lower contractual government price, which we record as allowances against accounts receivable. Although we may pay rebates in countries outside of the United States, to date, payments made to foreign governments have not represented a significant portion of our total government rebates. For government programs in the United States, we estimate these sales allowances based on contractual terms, historical utilization rates, new information regarding changes in these programs' regulations and guidelines that would impact the amount of the actual rebates, our expectations regarding future utilization rates for these programs and channel inventory data obtained from our major U.S. wholesalers in accordance with our inventory management agreements. During 2012, 2011 and 2010, U.S government rebates and chargebacks of $2.59 billion, $1.86 billion and $1.38 billion, respectively, representing 21%, 17% and 15% of total gross product sales, respectively, were deducted from gross product sales. We believe that the methodology that we use to estimate our sales allowances for government price reductions is reasonable and appropriate given the current facts and circumstances. However, actual results may differ. Based on the current information available to us, actual government rebates claimed for these periods have varied by less than 3% from our estimates recorded in those periods. As of December 31, 2012 and 2011, we had accrued U.S. government rebates of $716.6 million and $525.6 million, respectively, in accrued government rebates and had an allowance for government chargebacks of $111.1 million and $72.1 million, respectively, recorded against accounts receivable. 64 The following table summarizes the aggregate activity in our U.S. government rebates allowance and accrued government rebate accounts: Balance at Beginning of Year Charged to Expense Deducted from Accruals Balance at End of Year Year ended December 31, 2012: Government rebates allowances and accrued government rebates Activity related to 2012 sales $ $ 2,580,317 $ 1,836,199 $ 744,118 Activity related to sales prior to 2012 597,693 10,511 524,631 83,573 Total $ 597,693 $ 2,590,828 $ 2,360,830 $ 827,691 Year ended December 31, 2011: Government rebates allowances and accrued government rebates Activity related to 2011 sales $ $ 1,840,657 $ 1,279,643 $ 561,014 Activity related to sales prior to 2011 371,783 22,935 358,039 36,679 Total $ 371,783 $ 1,863,592 $ 1,637,682 $ 597,693 Allowance for Doubtful Accounts We maintain an allowance for doubtful accounts for estimated losses resulting from the inability of our customers to make required payments. This allowance is based on our analysis of several factors including, but not limited to, contractual payment terms, historical payment patterns of our customers and individual customer circumstances, an analysis of days sales outstanding by geographic region and a review of the local economic environment and its potential impact on government funding and reimbursement practices. If the financial condition of our customers or the economic environment in which they operate were to deteriorate, resulting in an inability to make payments, additional allowances may be required. We believe that the allowance for doubtful accounts is adequate; however, significant deterioration in any of the above factors could materially change these expectations and may result in an increase to our allowance for doubtful accounts. As of December 31, 2012 and 2011 , our allowance for doubtful accounts was $50.9 million and $59.8 million, respectively. Valuation of Intangible Assets and Contingent Consideration Liabilities Resulting from a Business Combination In conjunction with our business combinations, we have recorded intangible assets primarily related to IPR&D projects, and we have recorded contingent consideration liabilities payable upon the achievement of specified development, regulatory approval or sales-based milestone events. Both the identifiable intangible assets and contingent consideration liabilities are measured at their respective fair values as of the acquisition date. The models used in valuing these intangible assets and contingent consideration liabilities require the use of significant estimates and assumptions including but not limited to: estimates of revenues and operating profits related to the products or product candidates; the probability of success for unapproved product candidates considering their stages of development; the time and resources needed to complete the development and approval of product candidates; the life of the potential commercialized products and associated risks, including the inherent difficulties and uncertainties in developing a product candidate such as obtaining FDA and other regulatory approvals; and risks related to the viability of and potential alternative treatments in any future target markets. Intangible assets with indefinite useful lives are reviewed annually for impairment, or when facts or circumstances suggest that the carrying value of these assets may not be recoverable. W e revalue contingent consideration obligations each quarter following the acquisition and record increases or decreases in their fair value in R&D expense within our Consolidated Statement of Income. Increases or decreases in the fair value of our indefinite-lived intangible assets and contingent consideration liabilities can result from updates to assumptions such as the expected timing or probability of achieving the specified milestones, changes in projected revenues or changes in discount rates. Significant judgment is employed in determining these assumptions as of the acquisition date and for each subsequent period. Updates to assumptions could have a significant impact on our results of operations in any given period. Actual results may differ from estimates. As of December 31, 2012 and 2011 , we had total intangible assets of $11.74 billion and $1.06 billion , respectively, and contingent consideration liabilities of $205.1 million and $135.6 million , respectively. 65 Tax Provision We estimate our income tax provision, including deferred tax assets and liabilities, based on significant management judgment. We evaluate the realization of all or a portion of our deferred tax assets on a quarterly basis. We record a valuation allowance to reduce our deferred tax assets to the amounts that are more likely than not to be realized. We consider future taxable income, ongoing tax planning strategies and our historical financial performance in assessing the need for a valuation allowance. If we expect to realize deferred tax assets for which we have previously recorded a valuation allowance, we will reduce the valuation allowance in the period in which such determination is first made. Various factors may have favorable or unfavorable effects on our income tax rate. These factors include, but are not limited to, interpretations of existing tax laws, changes in tax laws and rates, our portion of the non-deductible pharmaceutical excise tax, the accounting for stock options and other share-based payments, mergers and acquisitions, future levels of R&D spending, changes in accounting standards, changes in the mix of earnings in the various tax jurisdictions in which we operate, changes in overall levels of pre-tax earnings and resolution of federal, state and foreign income tax audits. The impact on our income tax provision resulting from the above mentioned factors may be significant and could have a negative impact on our net income. We record liabilities related to uncertain tax positions in accordance with the guidance that clarifies the accounting for uncertainty in income taxes recognized in an enterprise's financial statements by prescribing a minimum recognition threshold and measurement attribute for the financial statement recognition and measurement of a tax position taken or expected to be taken in a tax return. We do not believe any such uncertain tax positions currently pending will have a material adverse effect on our Consolidated Financial Statements, although an adverse resolution of one or more of these uncertain tax positions in any period could have a material impact on the results of operations for that period. At December 31, 2012 and 2011 , we had total federal, state and foreign unrecognized tax benefits of $157.0 million and $146.9 million , respectively. Of the total unrecognized tax benefits, $126.5 million and $120.6 million at December 31, 2012 and 2011 , respectively, if recognized, would reduce our effective tax rate in the period of recognition. As of December 31, 2012 , we believe that it is reasonably possible that our unrecognized tax benefits will not significantly change in the next 12 months as we do not expect to have clarification from the IRS and other tax authorities regarding any of our uncertain tax positions. We file federal, state and foreign income tax returns in many jurisdictions in the United States and abroad. For federal income tax purposes, the statute of limitations is open for 2008 and onwards. For certain acquired entities, the statute of limitations is open for all years from inception due to our utilization of their net operating losses and credits carried over from prior years. For California income tax purposes, the statute of limitations is open for 2008 and onwards. Our income tax returns are audited by federal, state and foreign tax authorities. We are currently under examination by the IRS for the 2008 and 2009 tax years and by various state and foreign jurisdictions. There are differing interpretations of tax laws and regulations, and as a result, significant disputes may arise with these tax authorities involving issues of the timing and amount of deductions and allocations of income among various tax jurisdictions. We periodically evaluate our exposures associated with our tax filing positions. Off Balance Sheet Arrangements We do not have any off balance sheet arrangements as defined in Item 303(a)(4)(ii) of Regulation S-K. 66 Contractual Obligations Our contractual obligations consist of debt obligations, operating leases, capital commitments, purchase obligations for active pharmaceutical ingredients and inventory-related items and clinical trials contracts. The following table summarizes our significant enforceable and legally binding obligations, future commitments and obligations related to all contracts that we are likely to continue regardless of the fact that certain of these obligations may be cancelable as of December 31, 2012 (in thousands): Payments due by Period Contractual Obligations Total Less than one year 1-3 years 3-5 years More than 5 years Long-term debt (1) $ 10,355,158 $ 656,576 $ 2,420,576 $ 2,294,506 $ 4,983,500 Operating lease obligations 213,645 47,009 80,513 45,859 40,264 Capital commitments (2) 56,221 53,184 3,037 Purchase obligations (3)(4) 1,512,093 1,148,980 252,012 111,101 Clinical trials (5) 511,243 333,562 136,921 24,902 15,858 Total $ 12,648,360 $ 2,239,311 $ 2,893,059 $ 2,476,368 $ 5,039,622 (1) Long-term debt obligations include future interest payments based on fixed rates of 0.625%, 1.00% and 1.625% for our convertible senior notes due in May 2013, May 2014 and May 2016, respectively. Long-term debt obligations also include future interest payments based on fixed rates of 2.40%, 3.05%, 4.50%, 4.40% and 5.65% for our senior unsecured notes due in December 2014, December 2016, April 2021, December 2021 and December 2041, respectively. At December 31, 2012 , the aggregate carrying values of our convertible notes and senior unsecured notes were $2.79 billion and $4.69 billion, respectively. (2) At December 31, 2012 , we had firm capital project commitments of approximately $56.2 million primarily relating to facilities improvement projects. (3) At December 31, 2012 , we had firm purchase commitments related to active pharmaceutical ingredients and certain inventory-related items. These amounts include minimum purchase requirements and actual purchases are expected to significantly exceed these amounts. (4) In addition to the above, we have committed to make potential future milestone payments to third parties as part of licensing, collaboration and development arrangements. Payments under these agreements generally become due and payable only upon achievement of certain developmental, regulatory and/or commercial milestones. Because the achievement of these milestones is neither probable nor reasonably estimable, such contingencies have not been recorded on our Consolidated Balance Sheets and have not been included in the table above. (5) At December 31, 2012 , we had several clinical studies in various clinical trial phases. Our most significant clinical trial expenditures are to CROs. Although all of our material contracts with CROs are cancelable, we historically have not cancelled such contracts. These amounts reflect commitments based on existing contracts and do not reflect any future modifications to, or terminations of, existing contracts or anticipated or potential new contracts. We had total gross unrecognized tax benefit liabilities of $178.1 million as of December 31, 2012 . We believe that it is reasonably possible that our unrecognized tax benefits will not significantly change in the next 12 months as we do not expect to have clarification from the IRS and other tax authorities regarding any of our uncertain tax positions. The unrecognized tax benefits were included in long-term income taxes payable and non-current deferred tax assets on our Consolidated Balance Sheet and have not been included in the table above. Recent Accounting Pronouncement In July 2012, the Financial Accounting Standards Board issued new accounting guidance intended to simplify the testing of indefinite-lived intangible assets for impairment. Entities will be allowed the option to first perform a qualitative assessment on impairment for indefinite-lived intangible assets to determine whether a quantitative assessment is necessary. This guidance is effective for impairment tests performed in interim and annual periods for fiscal years beginning after September 15, 2012. Early adoption is permitted. We elected to early adopt this guidance as of December 31, 2012 which did not have a material impact on our Consolidated Financial Statements. 67
