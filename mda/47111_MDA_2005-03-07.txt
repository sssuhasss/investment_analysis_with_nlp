Item 7. MANAGEMENT S DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS OF FINANCIAL CONDITION AND RESULTS OF OPERATIONS OVERVIEW The Company concluded a strong year in 2004. Operating results were consistent with management strategies to profitably grow net sales, improve gross margin and carefully control selling, marketing and administrative costs, resulting in balanced, consistent growth in earnings. The Company gained market share in key classes of trade, introduced new product platforms that provide future growth opportunities, offset substantial increases in the cost of major raw materials, primarily cocoa and dairy products, and executed a $500 million share purchase from its major shareholder. The result was record sales, profits and earnings per share for the year. The Company long-term goals include increasing net sales 3% 4% per year, increasing gross margin 70 90 basis points per year, increasing earnings before interest and income taxes 7% 9% per year and to increase earnings per share 9% 11% per year. These goals are intended to achieve balanced, sustainable growth over time. In 2004, the Company exceeded all of these goals, except gross margin expansion which was up 50 basis points, slightly less than the long-term goal. The Company strategy to profitably grow net sales is based upon the introduction of innovative new products and limited edition items utilizing its key brands, such as Hershey , Reese and Hershey Kisses. During 2004, sales gains included product introductions such as Hershey Kisses filled with caramel, Swoops candies, Reese white chocolate peanut butter cups, Ice Breakers Liquid Ice mints , Hershey 1Gram Sugar Carb bar, and Hershey Take5 candy bar. The trends of key operating drivers, such as market share, are expected to continue to show positive results. During 2004, the Company achieved gains in market share each quarter and strengthened its confectionery category leadership position. Market share in measured channels increased 1.1 share points in the fourth quarter and .6 share points for the year. Measured channels include sales in the food, drug, convenience store and mass merchandiser classes of trade, excluding sales to Wal-Mart Stores, Inc. Net sales increased approximately 6% in 2004, compared with 2003 net sales, which were approximately 1% above 2002. The increase in 2004, and over the three-year period, primarily resulted from higher unit sales volume due to the introduction of new products and limited edition items, along with the impact of price increases, improved exchange rates on Canadian sales and, in 2004, improved trade promotion efficiency resulting in lower promotional spending as a percentage of sales. The Company strategy to expand gross margin is based upon obtaining price realization by achieving a larger part of its sales growth in its most highly profitable products and channels, improving the efficiency and effectiveness of its trade promotion programs and improving efficiencies in its supply chain. The Company has also implemented selected price increases and weight decreases to help offset increases in raw material costs, particularly for cocoa and dairy products. 10 Gross margin increased to 39.5% in 2004 compared with 39.0% in 2003 and 37.8% in 2002. The improvements in gross margin resulted from price increases, selected weight reductions and improved supply chain efficiency over the three-year period, more than offsetting higher raw material costs. Net income was $590.9 million in 2004 compared with $457.6 million in 2003. Net income per share-diluted of $2.30 for 2004, was up 33% from $1.73 per share for 2003. This gain resulted from increased income from operations, a non-recurring adjustment to the 2004 provision for income taxes, the impact of lower weighted-average shares outstanding resulting from share repurchases during the year and the impact of the cumulative effect of accounting changes recorded in 2003 associated with a change in accounting for the Company leases of certain warehouse and distribution facilities. Net income and income before the cumulative effect of accounting change for 2004 was favorably impacted by a $61.1 million adjustment to Federal and state income tax contingency reserves, as discussed below. Net income was $457.6 million in 2003, which included total net business realignment charges of $15.5 million after tax, an after-tax gain on the sale of certain gum brands of $5.7 million and the cumulative effect of accounting change of $7.4 million. Net income in 2002 was $403.6 million, which included total net business realignment charges of $21.5 million after tax and after-tax expenses of $10.9 million related to the exploration of the sale of the Company. The table below presents various items affecting the comparability of income over the three-year period ended December 31, 2004. These items include a reduction of the income tax provision in 2004 as a result of adjustments to income tax contingency reserves, the impact of business rationalization and realignment initiatives in 2003 and 2002, the gain on the sale of business in 2003 and charges to explore the sale of the Company in 2002. The Company believes the presentation of income excluding such items provides additional information to investors to facilitate the comparison of past and present operations which are indicative of its ongoing operations. The Company excludes such items in evaluating key measures of performance internally and in assessing the impact of known trends and uncertainties on its business. The Company believes that this presentation provides a more balanced view of the underlying dynamics of the business. Financial results including the impact of the reduction to the provision for income taxes, business realignment and rationalization charges, the gain on the sale of business and expenses related to the possible sale of the Company, over the three-year period may be insufficient in facilitating a complete understanding of the business as a whole and ascertaining the likelihood that past performance is indicative of future performance. The business realignment initiatives are described below and in Note 4 to the Consolidated Financial Statements and the reduction to the provision for income taxes as a result of adjustments to income tax contingency reserves is described below and in Note 12. For the years ended December 31, 2004 2003 2002 In thousands of dollars except per share amounts Per share- diluted Per share- diluted Per share- diluted Income before cumulative effect of accounting change $ 590,879 $ 2.30 $ 464,952 $ 1.76 $ 403,578 $ 1.47 Items affecting comparability after tax: Business realignment and asset impairments included in cost of sales 1,287 4,068 .01 Costs to explore the sale of the Company included in selling, marketing and administrative expense 10,907 .04 Business realignment and asset impairments, net 14,201 .05 17,441 .06 Gain on sale of business (5,706 ) (.02 ) Tax provision adjustment ( 61,081 ) (.24 ) Income excluding items affecting comparability $ 529,798 $ 2.06 $ 474,734 $ 1.79 $ 435,994 $ 1.58 11 Income per share-diluted excluding items affecting comparability increased 15% in 2004 and 13% in 2003, reflecting the impact of the Company increased sales, improved gross margin, control of selling, marketing and administrative costs and share repurchases during the period. This performance also drove increases in operating return on average invested capital during the period, as discussed under the heading Return Measures on page 32. During 2005, the Company expects continued sales growth of 6% 7%, including growth at the top end of its long-term 3% 4% goal for the ongoing business, enhanced by the first year impact of the Mauna Loa and Grupo Lorena acquisitions. The Company expects to continue to improve gross margin in 2005, despite higher input costs, particularly for commodities, transportation and employee benefits. These costs will be more than offset by price increases on its bar and packaged candy lines, announced in December 2004, that average approximately 3% over the entire domestic product line, and continued improvements in supply chain efficiency. Gross margin is expected to improve 30 40 basis points in 2005, including growth approaching the lower end of the Company long-term goal of 70 90 basis points for the ongoing business, reduced by the impact of integrating the lower margin Grupo Lorena and Mauna Loa businesses. The Company expects to achieve 2005 growth in earnings per share-diluted of 9% 11%, excluding items affecting comparability, in line with its long-term goal. This growth will result from the sales and gross margin increases discussed above, combined with continued control of selling, marketing, and administrative costs and the impact of lower shares outstanding resulting from the share repurchases in 2004. The Company cash flow from operations is expected to remain strong. During 2005, the Company will repay the $201.2 million of 6.7% Notes due in 2005 by utilizing cash provided from operations and additional short-term borrowings. Primary challenges in 2005 and beyond include profitable sales growth within the core confectionery category and entry into the broader snack market. Focus will continue to be placed on higher margin and faster growth channels. The achievement of the Company objectives for sales growth and profitability will also be challenged by changes in the business and competitive environment which will continue to be characterized by increased global competition and retailer consolidation, along with social issues such as childhood obesity concerns. In 2005, the Company will continue to be faced with achieving increased price realization and improved productivity in order to offset higher input costs for ingredients, transportation and employee benefits. Successfully meeting these challenges is critical to the Company achievement of its growth objectives. RESULTS OF OPERATIONS Net Sales Net sales increased $256.7 million, or 6%, from 2003 to 2004. Net sales were favorably impacted by increased sales volume, especially within the United States, primarily driven by the introduction of innovative new products and limited edition items. Net sales of the Company Canadian, Mexican and Brazilian businesses also improved as a result of higher sales volume. Favorable foreign currency exchange rates also resulted in increased sales for the Company international businesses, particularly in Canada. The positive impact of increased unit sales volume contributed more than 75% of the consolidated net sales growth. Higher selling prices, a more efficient rate of promotional spending and the acquisition of the Grupo Lorena business in Mexico also contributed to the net sales increase. Sales were unfavorably affected by the divestiture of certain gum brands in September 2003, decreased sales of remaining gum brands, and higher returns, discounts and allowances, relating primarily to the sales volume growth, along with lower export sales in Asia, particularly in China and Taiwan. Net sales increased $52.2 million, or 1%, from 2002 to 2003, resulting primarily from the selling price increase, volume growth in sales of key confectionery brands reflecting the introduction of new 12 products and limited edition items in the United States, and increased selling prices and sales volume, as well as the impact of favorable currency exchange rates for the Company Canadian business. These sales increases were substantially offset by higher promotional allowances, the continued rationalization of certain under-performing products and brands, including the divestiture of the Heide brands in June 2002, the discontinuance of the Company aseptically packaged drink products in the United States in March 2002 and the divestiture of certain gum brands in September 2003, and by a prior year buy-in associated with the January 2003 price increase discussed below. Net sales were also reduced by declines in export sales to Latin America and Asia, due primarily to changes in distributor relationships in certain markets and the discontinuance of certain products. In December 2002, the Company announced an increase of 11% in the price of standard-size candy bars effective January 1, 2003, representing an average increase of approximately 3% over the entire domestic product line. A buy-in prior to the January 1, 2003 price increase resulted in an approximate 1% to 2% increase in fourth quarter 2002 sales. Cost of Sales Cost of sales increased $134.8 million, or 5%, from 2003 to 2004. The cost increase was primarily caused by higher sales volume and higher raw material costs, principally associated with increased prices for cocoa and dairy products. These cost of sales increases were partially offset by lower costs primarily resulting from product weight reductions and reduced costs for packaging materials. Gross margin increased from 39.0% in 2003 to 39.5% in 2004. The margin expansion reflected improved price realization, primarily from reduced product weights and reduced promotional spending as a percentage of sales, as well as efficiency improvements in manufacturing operations. The margin improvements were partially offset by increases in raw material costs. Cost of sales decreased $16.3 million from 2002 to 2003. The cost decline was primarily caused by the divestitures and rationalization of certain products and lower supply chain costs, principally associated with reduced costs for raw materials, packaging, shipping and distribution. Lower raw material costs primarily for peanuts and dairy products were partially offset by higher costs for cocoa. These cost reductions were offset somewhat by sales volume increases for key confectionery brands. Cost of sales included costs associated with business realignment initiatives of $2.1 million and $6.4 million in 2003 and 2002, respectively. Business realignment costs in 2003 related to the write-off of certain inventories associated with discontinued products and, in 2002, reflected the relocation of manufacturing equipment due to the rationalization and consolidation of production lines. Gross margin increased from 37.8% in 2002 to 39.0% in 2003. The margin expansion reflected the impact of the price increase, an improved sales mix and the aforementioned decrease in supply chain costs. These margin improvements were partially offset by increases in promotional allowances. Selling, Marketing and Administrative Selling, marketing and administrative expenses for 2004 increased by $31.1 million, or 4%, from 2003. The increase was primarily attributable to higher employee compensation costs, increased consumer promotion expenses, termination costs associated with the closing of certain warehouse facilities, and litigation expenses associated with the introduction of Hershey SmartZone nutrition bars. These increases were offset somewhat by lower advertising expenses and a reduction in allowances for doubtful accounts, as described below. Selling, marketing and administrative expenses as a percentage of sales, decreased from 19.6% in 2003 to 19.1% in 2004. During the fourth quarter, the Company reached an agreement with Fleming Reclamation Creditor Trust, which resolved most significant matters related to the bankruptcy of Fleming Companies, Inc., one of the Company customers. Based on this agreement, the Company reduced its bad debt reserves by the $5.0 million which had been added at the time of the bankruptcy announcement in April 2003. Selling, marketing and administrative expenses for 2003 decreased by 2% from 2002, primarily attributable to a charge of $17.2 million in 2002 related to the exploration of the sale of the Company. Advertising and consumer promotion expenses were also lower in 2003 as a result of decisions to shift 13 spending to promotional allowances, as discussed above, and more efficient agency contracts. These cost reductions were offset somewhat by increased compensation and employee benefits costs, packaging development and marketing research expenses. On July 25, 2002, the Company confirmed that the Hershey Trust Company, as Trustee for the benefit of Milton Hershey School (the Milton Hershey School Trust ) which at that time controlled 77.6% of the combined voting power of the Company Common Stock and Class B Stock, had informed the Company that it had decided to diversify its holdings and in this regard wanted Hershey Foods Corporation to explore a sale of the entire Company. On September 17, 2002, the Milton Hershey School Trust informed the Company that it had elected not to sell its controlling interest and requested that the process to explore a sale be terminated. Business Realignment Initiatives In July 2003, the Company announced a number of initiatives continuing its value-enhancing strategy. These initiatives included realigning the sales organization and streamlining the supply chain by divesting or eliminating certain non-strategic brands and products, and by production line rationalization. During 2003, these actions resulted in a net charge of approximately $17.2 million, or $.04 per share-diluted. The $17.2 million net charge consisted of the write-off of certain inventories of $2.1 million included in cost of sales, a net business realignment and asset impairments charge of $23.4 million and an $8.3 million net gain resulting from the divestiture of certain brands. The net business realignment and asset impairments charge of $23.4 million consisted of early retirement and involuntary termination costs of $10.0 million, sales office closing and relocation costs of $7.3 million, fixed asset impairment charges of $5.7 million, equipment removal costs of $.7 million and a net gain of $.3 million relating to the elimination of non-strategic brands and products. In determining the fixed asset impairment losses, fair value was estimated based on the expected sales proceeds. Cash payments during 2003 reduced the liability balance, primarily relating to the aforementioned charges for employee termination, sales office closing and relocation costs, to $8.8 million as of December 31, 2003. Cash payments during 2004 reduced the liability balance to $3.9 million as of December 31, 2004. In late October 2001, the Company Board of Directors approved a plan to improve the efficiency and profitability of the Company operations. The plan included asset management improvements, product line rationalization, supply chain efficiency improvements and a voluntary work force reduction program (collectively, the 2001 business realignment initiatives ). Total costs for the 2001 business realignment initiatives recorded in 2002 and 2001 were $312.4 million. During 2002, charges to cost of sales and business realignment and asset impairments were recorded totaling $34.0 million before tax. The total included a charge to cost of sales of $6.4 million associated with the relocation of manufacturing equipment and a net business realignment and asset impairments charge of $27.6 million. Components of the net $27.6 million pre-tax charge included a $28.8 million charge for pension settlement losses resulting from a voluntary work force reduction program ( VWRP ), a $3.0 million charge for pension curtailment losses and special termination benefits resulting from manufacturing plant closures, a $.1 million charge relating to involuntary termination benefits and a $.1 million charge relating to the realignment of the domestic sales organization, partially offset by a $4.4 million favorable adjustment reflecting higher than estimated proceeds from the sale of certain assets. The major components of the 2001 business realignment initiatives were completed as of December 31, 2002. Remaining transactions primarily pertain to the sale of certain real estate associated with the closure of facilities, as discussed below. Product line rationalization plans included the sale or exit of certain businesses, the discontinuance of certain non-chocolate confectionery products and the realignment of the Company sales organizations. Costs associated with the realignment of the sales organizations related primarily to sales office closings and terminating the use of certain sales brokers. During 2002, sales offices were closed as planned and the use of certain sales brokers was discontinued which resulted in an 14 additional charge of $.1 million. During the second quarter of 2002, the sale of a group of the Company non-chocolate confectionery candy brands to Farley & Sathers Candy Company, Inc. ( Farley & Sathers ) was completed. Included in the transaction were the Heide, Jujyfruits, Wunderbeans and Amazin Fruit trademarked confectionery brands, as well as the rights to sell Chuckles branded products, under license. Proceeds of $12.0 million associated with the sale of certain confectionery brands to Farley & Sathers exceeded the 2001 estimates which resulted in a $4.4 million favorable adjustment. Also during the second quarter of 2002, the Company discontinued and subsequently licensed the sale of its aseptically packaged drink products in the United States. Net sales for these brands were $11.6 million in 2002. The sale of certain confectionery brands to Farley & Sathers resulted in the closure of a manufacturing facility in New Brunswick, New Jersey which was being held for sale as of December 31, 2002. The manufacturing facility was sold in May 2003. An additional charge of $.7 million relating to pension curtailment losses and special termination benefits associated with the closure of the facility was recorded in 2002. To improve supply chain efficiency and profitability, three manufacturing facilities, a distribution center and certain other facilities were planned to be closed. These included manufacturing facilities in Denver, Colorado; Pennsburg, Pennsylvania; and Palmyra, Pennsylvania and a distribution center and certain minor facilities located in Oakdale, California. During the first quarter of 2002, the manufacturing facility in Palmyra, Pennsylvania was closed and additional costs of $.1 million were recorded, as incurred, relating to retention payments. During the second quarter, operations utilizing the distribution center in Oakdale, California ceased. The manufacturing facilities in Denver, Colorado and Pennsburg, Pennsylvania were closed in the fourth quarter of 2002. An additional charge of $2.3 million relating to pension curtailment losses and special termination benefits associated with the facility closures was recorded in 2002. The Denver, Colorado and the Pennsburg, Pennsylvania facilities were being held for sale as of December 31, 2004. The Denver, Colorado facility was sold in February 2005. In October 2001, the Company offered the VWRP to certain eligible employees in the United States, Canada and Puerto Rico in order to reduce staffing levels and improve profitability. The VWRP consisted of an early retirement program which provided enhanced pension, post-retirement and certain supplemental benefits and an enhanced mutual separation program which provided increased severance and temporary medical benefits. A reduction of approximately 500 employees occurred during 2002 as a result of the VWRP. Additional pension settlement costs of $28.8 million were recorded in 2002, principally associated with lump sum payments of pension benefits. Gain on Sale of Business As part of the Company business realignment initiatives, the sale of a group of gum brands to Farley & Sathers was completed in September 2003. The gum brands included Fruit Stripe chewing gum, Rain-Blo gum balls and Super Bubble bubble gum. In the third quarter of 2003, the Company received cash proceeds from the sale of $20.0 million and recorded a gain of $8.3 million before tax, or $5.7 million after tax, as a result of the transaction. Interest Expense, Net Net interest expense for 2004 was $3.0 million higher than in 2003 primarily reflecting higher short-term interest expense, partially offset by increased capitalized interest. The increase in short-term interest expense was associated with commercial paper borrowings during 2004 for repurchases of Common Stock, business acquisitions and other funding requirements. Net interest expense for 2003 was $2.8 million higher than in 2002, primarily reflecting lower interest income and higher fixed interest expense, principally due to interest expense associated with the consolidation of three former off-balance sheet arrangements for the leasing of certain warehouse and distribution facilities, as discussed below. 15 Income Taxes The Company effective income tax rate was 29.3% in 2004, 36.6% in 2003 and 36.7% in 2002. The effective income tax rate for 2004 is not comparable with the rates for 2003 and 2002 because the Company provision for income taxes was reduced by the $61.1 million adjustment to income tax contingency reserves recorded in the second quarter of 2004. The non-cash reduction of income tax expense resulted from the settlement of Federal tax audits for the 1999 and 2000 tax years, as well as the resolution of a number of state tax audit issues. Based upon the results of the audits, the income tax contingency reserves were adjusted, resulting in a reduction of $61.1 million in income tax expense. The income tax contingency reserve adjustments related primarily to the deductibility and timing of certain expenses, interest on potential assessments, and acquisition and divestiture matters. The reduction in the 2004 provision for income taxes resulting from the adjustment to income tax contingency reserves reduced the effective income tax rate by 7.3 percentage points. The decrease in the effective income tax rate from 2002 to 2003 reflected the impact of the effective tax rates on business rationalization and realignment initiatives and the gain on sale of business in 2003. Cumulative Effect of Accounting Change An after-tax charge of $7.4 million, or $.03 per share-diluted, was recorded in 2003 to reflect the cumulative effect of a change in accounting for the Company leases of certain warehouse and distribution facilities as discussed further under the heading Off-Balance Sheet Arrangements, Contractual Obligations and Contingent Liabilities and Commitments. Net Income Net income was $590.9 million in 2004 compared with $457.6 million in 2003. Net income per share-diluted of $2.30 for 2004, was up 33% from $1.73 per share for 2003 as a result of the reduction to the 2004 provision for income taxes resulting from the adjustment to income tax contingency reserves, increased income from operations and the impact of lower weighted-average shares outstanding resulting from share repurchases during the year and the impact of the cumulative effect of accounting change recorded in 2003. Net income was $457.6 million in 2003 compared with $403.6 million in 2002. Net income per share-diluted of $1.73 for 2003, was up 18% from $1.47 per share for 2002 as a result of increased income from operations and the impact of lower weighted-average shares outstanding resulting from share repurchases during the year. Income before the cumulative effect of accounting change was $465.0 million for 2003, a 15% increase over 2002. Income per share-diluted before the cumulative effect of accounting change was $1.76 for 2003, 20% higher than in 2002. Income before the cumulative effect of accounting change for 2003 included total net business realignment charges of $15.5 million after tax and a gain on the sale of certain gum brands of $5.7 million after tax. Net income in 2002 was $403.6 million including total net business realignment charges of $21.5 million after tax and after-tax expenses of $10.9 million related to the exploration of the sale of the Company. FINANCIAL CONDITION The Company financial condition remained very strong during 2004. The capitalization ratio (total short-term and long-term debt as a percent of stockholders equity, short-term and long-term debt) increased to 55% as of December 31, 2004, from 43% as of December 31, 2003. The higher capitalization ratio in 2004 primarily reflected additional borrowings to finance the purchase of Common Stock from the Milton Hershey School Trust (described below) and the related decrease in stockholders equity as a result of the additional Treasury Stock. The ratio of current assets to current liabilities decreased to .9:1 as of December 31, 2004, from 1.9:1 as of December 31, 2003 primarily reflecting a decrease in cash and cash equivalents, an increase in short-term borrowings and an increase in the current portion of long-term debt, resulting from reclassification of $201.2 million of 16 6.7% Notes due in 2005 and $76.8 million related to certain lease agreements. The Company expects to satisfy these obligations using cash provided from operations and commercial paper borrowings. In December 2004, the Company acquired Mauna Loa for $127.8 million. Mauna Loa is the leading processor and marketer of macadamia snacks, with annual sales of approximately $80 million. In October 2004, the Company Mexican subsidiary, Hershey Mexico, acquired Grupo Lorena, one of Mexico top confectionery companies for $39.0 million. This business has annual sales of over $30 million. Included in the acquisition was the Pel n Pelo Rico brand. Had the results of the acquisitions been included in the consolidated results for the full year of 2004, the effect would not have been material. In July 2004, the Company purchased 11,281,589 shares of its Common Stock from the Milton Hershey School Trust, in a privately negotiated transaction. The Company paid $44.32 per share, or approximately $500.0 million for the shares and fees of $1.4 million associated with the transaction. In September 2003, the Company completed the sale of certain gum brands to Farley & Sathers for $20.0 million in cash as part of its business realignment initiatives. The gum brands included Fruit Stripe chewing gum, Rain-Blo gum balls and Super Bubble bubble gum. In June 2002, the Company completed the sale of certain confectionery brands to Farley & Sathers for $12.0 million in cash as part of its 2001 business realignment initiatives. Included in the transaction were the Heide, Jujyfruits, Wunderbeans and Amazin Fruit trademarked confectionery brands, as well as the rights to sell Chuckles branded products, under license. Assets Total assets increased $215.0 million, or 6% as of December 31, 2004, primarily as a result of higher inventories, deferred taxes, property, plant, and equipment, goodwill and other intangibles, partially offset by a decrease in cash and cash equivalents. These increases were principally associated with the acquisition of the Grupo Lorena and Mauna Loa businesses. Current assets increased by $50.9 million principally reflecting increased inventories to support higher anticipated sales in early 2005 prior to the effective date of selling price increases and inventories of $24.3 million related to the acquired businesses. The increase of current deferred income taxes was primarily related to the Mauna Loa acquisition and the tax effect on temporary differences associated with accrued liabilities for promotional allowances, inventories and gains or losses on derivatives included in other comprehensive income. The decrease in cash and cash equivalents reflected increased funding requirements for share repurchases, payment of dividends, capital additions and business acquisitions during the year. Property, plant and equipment was higher than the prior year primarily due to capital additions of $181.7 million and the acquisition of the Grupo Lorena and Mauna Loa businesses, partially offset by depreciation expense of $171.2 million. Goodwill increased as a result of the business acquisitions, partially offset by a $12.6 million adjustment to goodwill as a result of the adjustment to the Federal and state tax contingencies. The increase in other intangibles primarily reflected the estimated value of trademarks from the business acquisitions. The decrease in other assets primarily reflected reduced pension assets as a result of pension expense recorded in 2004. Liabilities Total liabilities increased by $405.6 million as of December 31, 2004, primarily reflecting an increase in short-term borrowings, partially offset by a reduction in deferred income tax liabilities resulting from the adjustment to income tax contingency reserves, net of an increase associated with the business acquisitions. The increase in accounts payable was due to the business acquisitions. Higher accrued liabilities were primarily related to increased promotional allowances and employee compensation in addition to $11.8 million associated with the business acquisitions. The increase in short-term debt of $331.2 million reflected commercial paper borrowings primarily associated with the repurchase of Common Stock from the Milton Hershey School Trust and the acquisition of the 17 Grupo Lorena and Mauna Loa businesses, along with other funding requirements. The increase in current portion of long-term debt and the corresponding decrease in long-term debt was associated with the reclassification of $201.2 million of 6.7% Notes due in 2005 and $76.8 million related to certain lease agreements. The increase in other long-term liabilities was primarily associated with incentive compensation. Capital Structure The Company has two classes of stock outstanding, Common Stock and Class B Stock. Holders of the Common Stock and the Class B Stock generally vote together without regard to class on matters submitted to stockholders, including the election of directors, with the Common Stock having one vote per share and the Class B Stock having ten votes per share. However, the Common Stock, voting separately as a class, is entitled to elect one-sixth of the Board of Directors. With respect to dividend rights, the Common Stock is entitled to cash dividends 10% higher than those declared and paid on the Class B Stock. In December 2000, the Company Board of Directors unanimously adopted a Stockholder Protection Rights Agreement ( Rights Agreement ). The Company largest stockholder, the Milton Hershey School Trust, supported the Rights Agreement. This action was not in response to any specific effort to acquire control of the Company. Under the Rights Agreement, the Company Board of Directors declared a dividend of one right ( Right ) for each outstanding share of Common Stock and Class B Stock payable to stockholders of record at the close of business on December 26, 2000. The Rights will at no time have voting power or receive dividends. The issuance of the Rights has no dilutive effect, will not affect reported earnings per share, is not taxable and will not change the manner in which the Company Common Stock is traded. The Rights Agreement is discussed further in Note 15 to the Consolidated Financial Statements. LIQUIDITY AND CAPITAL RESOURCES Historically, the Company major source of financing has been cash generated from operations. The Company income and, consequently, cash provided from operations during the year are affected by seasonal sales patterns, the timing of new product introductions, business acquisitions and divestitures, and price changes. Sales have typically been highest during the third and fourth quarters of the year, representing seasonal and holiday-related sales patterns. Generally, seasonal working capital needs peak during the summer months and have been met by issuing commercial paper. Over the past three years, cash provided from operating activities totaled $2.0 billion, net of cash contributions to pension plans of $436.4 million. Cash from operations combined with short-term borrowings was sufficient to fund share repurchases, capital expenditures, capitalized software additions, dividend payments and business acquisitions which totaled $2.3 billion. Total debt increased during the period by $428.0 million, reflecting increased short-term borrowings, as discussed above, in addition to an increase in long-term debt resulting from the consolidation of Special Purpose Trusts ( SPTs ) associated with certain lease agreements in 2003, offset somewhat by the repayment of long-term debt. Cash and cash equivalents decreased by $79.3 million during the period. The Company anticipates that capital expenditures and capitalized software additions will be in the range of $175 million to $200 million per annum during the next several years primarily for continued efficiency improvements in existing facilities and capacity expansion to support sales growth and new products, along with continued improvement and enhancements of computer software. As of December 31, 2004, the Company principal capital commitments included manufacturing capacity expansion to support sales growth and new products, modernization and efficiency improvements and selected enhancements of computer software. As of December 31, 2004, the fair value of the Company pension plan assets exceeded benefits obligations. Contributions totaling $8.0 million, $120.3 million and $308.1 million were made to the 18 pension plans during 2004, 2003 and 2002, respectively, primarily to improve the funded status as a result of negative returns on pension plan assets during 2002. Under share repurchase programs which began in 1993, a total of 51,682,864 shares of Common Stock have been repurchased for approximately $1.3 billion, including purchases from the Milton Hershey School Trust of 8,000,000 shares for $103.1 million in 1993 and 3,159,558 shares for $100.0 million in 1999. Of the shares repurchased, 1,056,000 shares were retired and 21,361,107 shares were reissued to satisfy stock option obligations, Supplemental Retirement Contributions and employee stock ownership trust ( ESOP ) obligations. Of the shares reissued, 16,765,409 shares were repurchased in the open market to replace the reissued shares. Additionally, the Company has purchased a total of 67,282,661 shares of its Common Stock to be held as Treasury Stock from the Milton Hershey School Trust for $1.5 billion in privately negotiated transactions, including 11,281,589 shares for approximately $500 million in 2004. As of December 31, 2004, a total of 113,313,827 shares were held as Treasury Stock and $55.0 million remained available for repurchases of Common Stock under the $500 million share repurchase program approved by the Company Board of Directors in December 2002. As of December 31, 2004, $250 million of debt securities remained available for issuance under an August 1997 Form S-3 Registration Statement. Proceeds from any offering of the $250 million of debt securities available under the shelf registration may be used for general corporate requirements, which include reducing existing commercial paper borrowings, financing capital additions and share repurchases, and funding future business acquisitions and working capital requirements. In November 2004, the Company entered into a Five Year Credit Agreement (the Credit Agreement ) with the banks, financial institutions and other institutional lenders listed on the respective signature pages thereof ( Lenders ), Citibank, N.A., as administrative agent for the Lenders (as defined therein), Bank of America, N.A., as syndication agent, UBS Loan Finance LLC, as documentation agent, and Citigroup Global Markets, Inc. and Banc of America Securities LLC, as joint lead arrangers and joint book managers. The Credit Agreement establishes an unsecured revolving credit facility under which the Company may borrow up to $900 million with the option to increase borrowings by an additional $600 million with the concurrence of the Lenders. Funds borrowed may be used for general corporate purposes, including commercial paper backstop and business acquisitions. Advances other than competitive bid advances may be repaid without penalty at any time prior to the last day of the Credit Agreement. Competitive bid advances must be paid at maturity, and may not be prepaid. The Credit Agreement contains a financial covenant whereby the ratio of (a) pre-tax income from continuing operations from the most recent four fiscal quarters to (b) consolidated interest expense for the most recent four fiscal quarters may not be less than 2.0 to 1 at the end of each fiscal quarter. The Credit Agreement contains customary representations and warranties and events of default. Payment of outstanding advances may be accelerated, at the option of the Lenders, should the Company default in its obligations under the Credit Agreement. With the execution of the Credit Agreement in November 2004, short-term and long-term committed credit facilities previously maintained by the Company in the United States (together the Prior Facilities ) were terminated. The Prior Facilities consisted of the following: (x) Amended and Restated Five-Year Credit Agreement dated as of November 27, 2001 ($200 million) among the Company, the banks, financial institutions and other institutional lenders listed on the signature pages thereof, and Citibank, N.A. as administrative agent, Bank of America, N.A. as syndication agent, and Salomon Smith Barney Inc. and Banc America Securities LLC, as joint lead arrangers and joint book managers; (y) Amended and Restated 364-Day Credit Agreement dated as of November 27, 2001 (as subsequently amended and renewed November 26, 2002 and November 25, 2003) ($200 million) among the Company, the banks, financial institutions and other institutional lenders listed on the signature pages thereof, and Citibank, N.A. as administrative agent, Bank of America, N.A. as syndication agent, and Salomon Smith Barney Inc. and Banc America Securities LLC, as joint lead arrangers and joint book managers; and (z) 364-Day Credit Agreement dated as of July 28, 2004 ($500 million) among the Company, the banks, financial institutions and other institutional lenders listed on the signature pages thereof, and Citibank, N.A. as administrative 19 agent, Bank of America, N.A. as syndication agent, and Citigroup Global Markets Inc. and Banc America Securities LLC, as joint lead arrangers and joint book managers. The representations and warranties, events of default, financial covenant and other terms of the Prior Facilities are substantially similar to the provisions contained in the new Credit Agreement. The Company also maintains lines of credit with domestic and international commercial banks, under which it could borrow in various currencies up to approximately $60.3 million and $43.6 million as of December 31, 2004 and 2003, respectively. The higher lines of credit as of December 31, 2004, were primarily associated with the Company businesses in Canada and China. Cash Flow Activities Over the past three years, cash from operating activities provided approximately $2.0 billion. Over this period, cash used by or provided from accounts receivable and inventories has tended to fluctuate as a result of sales during December and inventory management practices. The change in cash required for or provided from other assets and liabilities between the years was primarily related to hedging transactions, the timing of payments for accrued liabilities, including income taxes, and variations in the funded status of pension plans. In 2004, the adjustment of deferred income taxes primarily reflects the deferred tax benefit resulting from the $61.1 million adjustment to income tax contingency reserves recorded in the second quarter of 2004 and an increase resulting from the Mauna Loa acquisition. Investing activities included capital additions, capitalized software additions, and several business acquisitions and divestitures. Capital additions during the past three years included the purchase of manufacturing equipment, and expansion and modernization of existing facilities. Capitalized software additions over the past three years were associated primarily with the ongoing enhancement of information systems. In December 2004, the Company acquired Mauna Loa, a leading processor and marketer of macadamia snacks, for $127.8 million and in October 2004, the Company Mexican subsidiary, Hershey Mexico, acquired Grupo Lorena, one of Mexico top confectionery companies, for $39.0 million. In July 2004, the Company purchased 11,281,589 shares of its Common Stock from the Milton Hershey School Trust in a privately negotiated transaction. The Company paid $44.32 per share, or approximately $500.0 million, for the shares and fees of $1.4 million associated with the transaction. In August 2003, the Company completed the sale of a group of gum brands to Farley & Sathers for $20.0 million in cash as part of its business realignment initiatives and in June 2002, the Company completed the sale of certain confectionery brands to Farley & Sathers for $12.0 million in cash as part of its 2001 business realignment initiatives. Financing activities included debt borrowings and repayments, payments of dividends, the exercise of stock options, incentive plan transactions and the repurchase of Common Stock. During the past three years, short-term borrowings in the form of commercial paper or bank borrowings were used to fund seasonal working capital requirements and finance share repurchase programs, including the purchase of Common Stock from the Milton Hershey School Trust. During the past three years, a total of 20,138,634 shares of Common Stock have been repurchased for $1.0 billion. Cash used for incentive plan transactions of $325.8 million during the past three years was partially offset by cash received from the exercise of stock options of $221.2 million. Cash used by incentive plan transactions reflected purchases of the Company Common Stock in the open market to replace Treasury Stock issued for stock options exercises. The Company intends to repurchase shares to replace shares issued for stock options exercises. The value of shares purchased in a given period will vary based upon stock options exercises over time and market conditions. As of December 31, 2004, approximately 1.9 million shares issued for stock options exercises in 2004 and 2003 remained to be repurchased. Most of these shares were repurchased in early 2005. Net cash provided from operating activities was $797.5 million for 2004, an increase of $204.5 million compared with the prior year. The primary contributors to the increase were higher net income and increases in cash provided from other assets and liabilities and accounts receivable. These 20 increases were partially offset by a decrease in cash flows related to deferred income taxes, principally reflecting the deferred tax benefit resulting from the income tax contingency reserve adjustment of $73.7 million in the second quarter of 2004, and cash used as a result of higher inventories as of December 31, 2004, to support higher sales anticipated in early 2005 prior to the effective date of selling price increases. Cash provided from changes in other assets and liabilities was $132.8 million in 2004 compared with a use of cash of $81.4 million in 2003. The change in cash flows reflected reduced cash contributions to the Company pension plans which were $112.2 million lower in 2004 compared with 2003, increased cash provided from commodity transactions, primarily reflecting higher commodity futures market prices in 2004, and cash provided from higher liabilities primarily associated with incentive plans in 2004. An increase in cash provided by accounts receivable in 2004 compared with cash used by accounts receivable in 2003 was primarily attributable to improved cash collections. Net cash provided from operating activities was $592.9 million for 2003, a decrease of $32.4 million compared with 2002. The primary contributors to the decrease were reductions in cash provided from deferred income taxes and higher accounts receivable balances at year-end. The decrease in cash provided from deferred income taxes principally reflected the tax impact of the lower pension plan contributions in 2003 versus 2002. The decreases above were partially offset by higher net income and increases in cash provided from other assets and liabilities and accounts payable. Cash used by other assets and liabilities was $81.4 million in 2003 compared with $106.5 million in 2002. The reduction in the use of cash reflected reduced cash contributions to the Company pension plans which were $187.8 million lower in 2003 compared with 2002, decreased cash provided from commodity transactions primarily reflecting lower commodity futures market prices in 2003, and an increase in cash provided by higher liabilities primarily associated with selling and marketing programs in 2003. The increase in cash provided from accounts payable reflected the timing of payments. Off-Balance Sheet Arrangements, Contractual Obligations and Contingent Liabilities and Commitments The following table summarizes the Company contractual cash obligations by year: Payments Due by Year (In thousands of dollars) Contractual Obligations 2005 2006 2007 2008 2009 Thereafter Total Unconditional Purchase Obligations $ 796,500 $ 291,700 $ 33,100 $ 7,500 $ 3,700 $ $ 1,132,500 Non-cancelable Operating Leases 12,579 12,188 11,263 8,654 5,034 11,645 61,363 Long-term Debt 279,043 142 191,008 147 150 499,155 969,645 Total Obligations $ 1,088,122 $ 304,030 $ 235,371 $ 16,301 $ 8,884 $ 510,800 $ 2,163,508 In entering into contractual obligations, the Company has assumed the risk which might arise from the possible inability of counterparties to meet the terms of their contracts. The Company risk is limited to replacing the contracts at prevailing market rates. The Company does not expect any significant losses as a result of counterparty defaults. The Company has entered into certain obligations for the purchase of raw materials. Purchase obligations primarily reflect forward contracts for the purchase of raw materials from third-party brokers and dealers to minimize the effect of future price fluctuations. Total obligations for each year are comprised of fixed price contracts for the purchase of commodities and unpriced contracts that have been valued using market prices as of December 31, 2004. The cost of commodities associated with the unpriced contracts is variable as market prices change over future periods. However, the 21 variability of such costs is mitigated to the extent of the Company futures price cover for those periods. Accordingly, increases or decreases in market prices will be offset by gains or losses on commodity futures contracts to the extent that the unpriced contracts are hedged as of December 31, 2004 and in future periods. Taking delivery of the specific commodities for use in the manufacture of finished goods satisfies these obligations. For each of the three years in the period ended December 31, 2004, such obligations were fully satisfied by taking delivery of and making payment for the specific commodities. In January 2003, the Financial Accounting Standards Board ( FASB ) issued Interpretation No. 46, Consolidation of Variable Interest Entities, an interpretation of ARB No. 51 ( Interpretation No. 46 ). Interpretation No. 46 addresses consolidation by business enterprises of special-purpose entities ( SPEs ), such as SPTs, to which the usual condition for consolidation described in Accounting Research Bulletin No. 51, Consolidated Financial Statements, does not apply because the SPEs have no voting interests or otherwise are not subject to control through ownership of voting interests. The Company adopted Interpretation No. 46 as of June 30, 2003, resulting in the consolidation of three off-balance sheet arrangements with SPTs. As of December 31, 2004 and 2003, the Company had no off-balance sheet arrangements. The consolidation of the SPTs resulted in an adjustment to record the cumulative effect of the accounting change of approximately $7.4 million, or $.03 per share-diluted, in the third quarter of 2003, reflecting the after-tax effect of accumulated depreciation for these facilities from lease inception through June 29, 2003. Additionally, the consolidation of these entities resulted in a net increase to property, plant and equipment of approximately $107.7 million, with a corresponding increase to long-term debt of $115.5 million and to other long-term liabilities of $4.4 million, reflecting the third party equity interest associated with the lease arrangements. Prior to June 30, 2003, expenses associated with the lease arrangements were classified as rent expense and included in cost of sales in the Consolidated Statements of Income. Subsequent to the consolidation of these entities, expenses were classified as interest expense associated with the corresponding long-term debt. The consolidation of these entities resulted in an increase to interest expense of $2.8 million in 2003, offset by a decrease in rental expense for these facilities included in cost of sales. An increase in depreciation expense of $2.6 million in 2003 also resulted from the consolidation of these entities, with a total of $5.4 million of depreciation expense recorded in 2004. During 1999 and 2000, the Company entered into off-balance sheet arrangements for the leasing of certain warehouse and distribution facilities. These off-balance sheet arrangements enabled the Company to lease these facilities under more favorable terms than other leasing alternatives. The lease arrangements are with SPTs whereby the Company leases warehouse and distribution facilities in Redlands, California; Atlanta, Georgia; and Hershey, Pennsylvania, as discussed below. The SPTs were formed to facilitate the acquisition and subsequent leasing of the facilities to the Company. The SPTs financed the acquisition of the facilities by issuing notes and equity certificates to independent third-party financial institutions. The independent third-party financial institutions that hold the equity certificates are the owners of the SPTs. The owners of the SPTs have made substantive residual equity capital investments in excess of 3% which will be at risk during the entire term of each lease. Accordingly, the Company did not consolidate the SPTs prior to June 30, 2003 because all of the conditions for consolidation had not been met. In December 2000, the Company entered into a lease agreement with the owner of the warehouse and distribution facility in Redlands, California. The lease term was approximately ten years, with occupancy to begin upon completion of the facility. The lease agreement contained an option for the Company to purchase the facility. In January 2002, the Company assigned its right to purchase the facility to an SPT that in turn purchased the completed facility and leased it to the Company under a new lease agreement. The lease term is five years, with up to 22 four renewal periods of five years each with the consent of the lessor. The cost incurred by the SPT to acquire the facility, including land, was $40.1 million. In October 2000, the Company entered into a lease agreement with an SPT for the leasing of a warehouse and distribution facility near Atlanta, Georgia. The lease term is five years, with up to four renewal periods of five years each with the consent of the lessor. The cost incurred by the SPT to acquire the facility, including land, was $18.2 million. In July 1999, the Company entered into a lease agreement with an SPT for the construction and leasing of a warehouse and distribution facility located on land owned by the Company near Hershey, Pennsylvania. Under the agreement, the lessor paid construction costs totaling $61.7 million. The lease term is six years, including the one-year construction period, with up to four renewal periods of five years each with the consent of the lessor. Aside from the residual guarantees and instrument guarantees associated with the individual leasing arrangements, as discussed below, the Company has provided no other guarantees or capitalization of these entities. The Company has not collateralized the obligations in connection with these leases. The Company has no obligations with respect to refinancing of the lessor debt, would incur no significant penalties which would result in the reasonable assurance of continuation of the leases and has no significant guarantees other than the residual and instrument guarantees discussed below. There are no other material commitments or contingent liabilities associated with the leasing arrangements. The Company transactions with the SPTs are limited to the lease agreements. The Company does not anticipate entering into any other arrangements involving SPEs. The leases include substantial residual guarantees by the Company for a significant amount of the financing and options to purchase the facilities at original cost. Pursuant to instrument guarantees, in the event of a default under the lease agreements, the Company guaranteed to the note holders and certificate holders payment in an amount equal to all sums then due under the leases. There are no penalties or other disincentives under the lease agreements if the Company decides not to renew any of the three leases. The terms for each renewal period under each of the three lease arrangements are identical to the initial terms and do not represent bargain lease terms. If the Company were to exercise its options to purchase the three facilities at original cost at the end of the respective initial lease terms, the Company could purchase the facilities for a total of approximately $120.0 million, $79.9 million for the Pennsylvania and Georgia facilities in 2005 and $40.1 million for the California facility in 2007. If the Company chooses not to renew the leases or purchase the assets at the end of the lease terms, the Company is obligated under the residual guarantees for approximately $103.2 million in total for the three leases. Additionally, the Company is obligated to re-market each property on the lessor behalf and, upon sale, distribute a portion of the proceeds to the note holders and certificate holders up to an amount equal to the remaining debt and equity certificates and to pay closing costs. If the Company chooses not to renew or purchase the assets at the end of the lease terms, the Company does not anticipate a material disruption to operations, since such facilities are not unique, facilities with similar racking and storage capabilities are available in each of the areas where the facilities are located, there are no significant leasehold improvements that would be impaired, there would be no adverse tax consequences, the financing of replacement facilities would not be material to the Company cash flows and costs related to relocation would not be significant to income. The facility located near Hershey, Pennsylvania was constructed on land owned by the Company. The Company entered into a ground lease with the lessor, an SPT. The initial term of the ground lease extends to the date that is the later of (i) the date the facility lease is no longer in effect, or (ii) the date when the Company satisfies the residual guarantee associated with the lease. An additional term for the ground lease begins upon the end of the initial ground lease term and ends upon the later of the date all sums required to be paid under the lease agreement are paid in full and the 75th anniversary of the ground lease commencement date. If the Company chooses not to renew the building lease or purchase the building, it must re-market the building on the lessor behalf subject to the ground lease, which will continue in force until the earlier of the date all sums required to be paid under the lease agreement are paid in full and the 75th anniversary of the ground lease inception date. The lease of the warehouse and distribution facility does not include any provisions which would require the Company to sell the land to the SPT. 23 The Company provision for income taxes, accrued income taxes and deferred income taxes are based upon income, statutory tax rates, the legal structure of the Company and interpretation of tax laws. As a matter of course, the Company is regularly audited by Federal, state and foreign tax authorities. From time to time, these audits result in assessments of additional tax. The Company maintains reserves for such assessments. The reserves are determined based upon the Company judgment of assessment risk and are adjusted, from time to time, based upon changing facts and circumstances, such as receiving audit assessments or clearing of an item for which a reserve has been established. A settlement of Federal tax audits for the 1999 and 2000 tax years, as well as the resolution of a number of state tax audit issues were concluded during the second quarter of 2004. Based upon the results of the audits, the income tax contingency reserves were adjusted resulting in a reduction of income tax reserves by $73.7 million, reflecting a reduction of the provision for income taxes by $61.1 million and a reduction to goodwill of $12.6 million. The income tax contingency reserve adjustments related primarily to the deductibility and timing of certain expenses, interest on potential assessments, and acquisition and divestiture matters. Assessments of additional tax require use of the Company cash. The Company is not aware of any significant income tax assessments. ACCOUNTING POLICIES AND MARKET RISKS ASSOCIATED WITH DERIVATIVE INSTRUMENTS The Company utilizes certain derivative instruments, from time to time, including interest rate swaps, foreign currency forward exchange contracts and options, and commodities futures contracts, to manage interest rate, currency exchange rate and commodity market price risk exposures. Interest rate swaps and foreign currency contracts and options are entered into for periods consistent with related underlying exposures and do not constitute positions independent of those exposures. Commodities futures contracts are entered into for varying periods and are intended to be and are effective as hedges of market price risks associated with anticipated raw material purchases, energy requirements and transportation costs. The Company does not hold or issue derivative instruments for trading purposes and is not a party to any instruments with leverage or prepayment features. In entering into these contracts, the Company has assumed the risk that might arise from the possible inability of counterparties to meet the terms of their contracts. The Company does not expect any significant losses as a result of counterparty defaults. The Company accounts for derivative instruments in accordance with Statement of Financial Accounting Standards No. 133, Accounting for Derivative Instruments and Hedging Activities , as amended ( SFAS No. 133, as amended ). SFAS No. 133, as amended, provides that the effective portion of the gain or loss on a derivative instrument designated and qualifying as a cash flow hedging instrument be reported as a component of other comprehensive income and be reclassified into earnings in the same period or periods during which the transaction affects earnings. The remaining gain or loss on the derivative instrument, if any, must be recognized currently in earnings. For a derivative designated as hedging the exposure to changes in the fair value of a recognized asset or liability or a firm commitment (referred to as a fair value hedge), the gain or loss must be recognized in earnings in the period of change together with the offsetting loss or gain on the hedged item attributable to the risk being hedged. The effect of that accounting is to reflect in earnings the extent to which the hedge is not effective in achieving offsetting changes in fair value. All derivative instruments currently utilized by the Company, including variable to fixed interest rate swaps, foreign exchange contracts and options and commodities futures contracts, are designated and accounted for as cash flow hedges. The Company adopted SFAS No. 133, as amended, as of January 1, 2001. Additional information with regard to accounting policies associated with derivative instruments is contained in Note 6 to the Consolidated Financial Statements, Derivative Instruments and Hedging Activities. 24 The information below summarizes the Company market risks associated with long-term debt and derivative instruments outstanding as of December 31, 2004. This information should be read in conjunction with Note 1, Note 6 and Note 8 to the Consolidated Financial Statements. Long-Term Debt The table below presents the principal cash flows and related interest rates by maturity date for long-term debt, including the current portion, as of December 31, 2004. The fair value of long-term debt was determined based upon quoted market prices for the same or similar debt issues. Maturity Date (In thousands of dollars except for rates) 2005 2006 2007 2008 2009 Thereafter Total Fair Value Long-term Debt $279,043 $142 $191,008 $147 $150 $499,155 $969,645 $1,094,281 Interest Rate 5.9 % 2.0 % 6.3 % 2.0 % 2.0 % 7.4 % 6.8 % Interest rates on variable rate obligations were calculated using the rate in effect as of December 31, 2004. Interest rates on certain long-term debt have been converted from variable to fixed rates as discussed under the heading Interest Rate Swaps below. Interest Rate Swaps In order to minimize its financing costs and to manage interest rate exposure, the Company, from time to time, enters into interest rate swap agreements. In October 2003, the Company entered into interest rate swap agreements to effectively convert interest payments on long-term debt from fixed to variable rates. Interest payments on $200.0 million of 6.7% Notes due in October 2005 and $150.0 million of 6.95% Notes due in March 2007 were converted from the respective fixed rates to variable rates based on the London Interbank Offered Rate, LIBOR. In March 2004, the Company terminated these agreements, resulting in cash receipts totaling $5.2 million, with a corresponding increase to the carrying value of the long-term debt. This increase is being amortized over the remaining term of the respective long-term debt as a reduction to interest expense. In February 2001, the Company entered into interest rate swap agreements that effectively converted variable-interest-rate payments on certain leases from a variable to a fixed rate of 6.1%. The fair value of interest rate swaps is defined as the difference in the present values of cash flows calculated at the contracted interest rates and at current market interest rates at the end of the period. The fair value of the swap agreements is calculated quarterly based upon the quoted market price for the same or similar financial instruments. The fair value of the variable to fixed interest rate swaps was a liability of $1.7 million and $5.2 million as of December 31, 2004 and 2003, respectively. The potential net loss in fair value of interest rate swaps of ten percent resulting from a hypothetical near-term adverse change in market rates was $.2 million and $.5 million as of December 31, 2004 and 2003, respectively. The Company risk related to the interest rate swap agreements is limited to the cost of replacing the agreements at prevailing market rates. Foreign Exchange Forward Contracts and Options The Company enters into foreign exchange forward contracts and options to hedge transactions primarily related to firm commitments to purchase or forecasted purchases of equipment, certain raw materials and finished goods denominated in foreign currencies and to hedge payment of forecasted intercompany transactions with its subsidiaries outside the United States. These contracts reduce currency risk from exchange rate movements. Foreign currency price risks are hedged generally for periods from 3 to 24 months. Foreign exchange forward contracts and options are intended to be and are effective as hedges of identifiable, foreign currency commitments. Foreign exchange forward contracts are designated as cash flow hedging derivatives and the fair value of such contracts is recorded on the Consolidated Balance Sheets as either an asset or liability. Gains and losses on these contracts are recorded as 25 a component of other comprehensive income and are reclassified into earnings in the same period during which the hedged transaction affects earnings. As of December 31, 2004, the Company had foreign exchange forward contracts and options maturing primarily in 2005 and 2006 to purchase $103.1 million in foreign currency, primarily Australian dollars, Canadian dollars and euros, and to sell $30.8 million in foreign currency, primarily Mexican pesos and Japanese yen, at contracted forward rates. As of December 31, 2003, the Company had foreign exchange forward contracts and options maturing primarily in 2004 and 2005 to purchase $57.7 million in foreign currency, primarily Canadian dollars, and to sell $18.0 million in foreign currency, primarily Japanese yen, at contracted forward rates. The fair value of foreign exchange contracts and options is defined as the amount of the difference between contracted and current market foreign currency exchange rates as of the end of the period. On a quarterly basis, the fair value of foreign exchange forward contracts and options is estimated by obtaining market quotes for future contracts with similar terms, adjusted where necessary for maturity differences. The fair value of foreign exchange forward contracts and options was an asset of $4.4 million and $1.6 million as of December 31, 2004 and 2003, respectively. The potential net loss in fair value of foreign exchange forward contracts and options of ten percent resulting from a hypothetical near-term adverse change in market rates was $.4 million and $.2 million as of December 31, 2004 and 2003, respectively. The Company risk related to the foreign exchange contracts and options is limited to the cost of replacing the contracts at prevailing market rates. Commodity Price Risk Management The Company most significant raw material requirements include cocoa, sugar, milk, peanuts and almonds. The Company attempts to minimize the effect of future price fluctuations related to the purchase of these raw materials primarily through forward purchasing to cover future manufacturing requirements, generally for periods from 3 to 24 months. With regard to cocoa, sugar, corn sweeteners, natural gas, fuel oil and certain dairy products, price risks are also managed by entering into futures contracts. At the present time, active futures contracts are not available for use in pricing the Company other major raw material requirements. Futures contracts are used in combination with forward purchasing of cocoa, sugar, corn sweetener, natural gas and certain dairy product requirements principally to take advantage of market fluctuations that provide more favorable pricing opportunities and flexibility in sourcing these raw material and energy requirements. Fuel oil futures contracts are used to minimize price fluctuations associated with the Company transportation costs. The Company commodity procurement practices are intended to reduce the risk of future price increases, but also may potentially limit the ability to benefit from possible price decreases. The cost of cocoa beans and the prices for the related commodity futures contracts historically have been subject to wide fluctuations attributable to a variety of factors, including the effect of weather on crop yield, other imbalances between supply and demand, currency exchange rates, political unrest in producing countries and speculative influences. After declining from an eighteen-year high in February 2003, cocoa continued to trade at relatively high price levels during 2004. Continued civil unrest in the world largest cocoa-producing country, the Ivory Coast, resulted in volatile market conditions, but has not materially affected the harvesting and marketing of the cocoa crop. The Company costs during 2005 and beyond will not necessarily reflect market price fluctuations because of its forward purchasing practices, premiums and discounts reflective of relative values, varying delivery times, and supply and demand for specific varieties and grades of cocoa beans. The Company costs for cocoa will increase in 2005; however, the Company expects to achieve its long-term goals for growth and profitability by a combination of selling price increases, supply chain cost reductions and strict control of other costs to offset cost increases and respond to changes in the competitive environment. 26 Commodities Futures Contracts In connection with the purchasing of cocoa, sugar, corn sweeteners, natural gas, fuel oil and certain dairy products for anticipated manufacturing requirements and to hedge transportation costs, the Company enters into commodities futures contracts as deemed appropriate to reduce the effect of price fluctuations. Exchange traded futures contracts are used to fix the price of physical forward purchase contracts. Cash transfers reflecting changes in the value of futures contracts (unrealized gains and losses) are made on a daily basis. The Company accounts for commodities futures contracts in accordance with SFAS No. 133, as amended, and accordingly, cash transfers are reported as a component of other comprehensive income. Such cash transfers will be offset by higher or lower cash requirements for payment of invoice prices of raw materials, energy requirements and transportation costs in the future. Futures being held in excess of the amount required to fix the price of unpriced physical forward contracts are effective as hedges of anticipated purchases. The following sensitivity analysis reflects the market risk of the Company to a hypothetical adverse market price movement of ten percent, based on the Company net commodity positions at four dates spaced equally throughout the year. The Company net commodity positions consist of the excess of futures contracts held over unpriced physical forward contracts for the same commodities, relating to cocoa, sugar, corn sweeteners, natural gas, fuel oil and certain dairy products. Inventories, priced forward contracts and estimated anticipated purchases not yet contracted for were not included in the sensitivity analysis calculations. A loss is defined, for purposes of determining market risk, as the potential decrease in fair value or the opportunity cost resulting from the hypothetical adverse price movement. The fair values of net commodity positions were based upon quoted market prices or estimated future prices including estimated carrying costs corresponding with the future delivery period. For the years ended December 31, 2004 2003 In millions of dollars Fair Value Market Risk (Hypothetical 10% Change) Fair Value Market Risk (Hypothetical 10% Change) Highest long position $ 128.2 $12.8 $ 115.0 $11.5 Lowest long position (30.1 ) 3.0 (14.3 ) 1.4 Average position (long) 62.7 6.3 54.9 5.5 The increase in fair values from 2003 to 2004 primarily reflected an increase in commodity prices during 2004. The negative positions primarily resulted as unpriced physical forward contract futures requirements exceeded the amount of commodities futures being held at certain points in time during the years. Sensitivity analysis disclosures represent forward-looking statements, which are subject to certain risks and uncertainties that could cause actual results to differ materially from those presently anticipated or projected. The important factors that could affect the sensitivity analysis disclosures include significant increases or decreases in market prices reflecting fluctuations attributable to the effect of weather on crop yield, other imbalances between supply and demand, currency exchange rates, political unrest in producing countries and speculative influences in addition to changes in the Company hedging strategies. USE OF ESTIMATES AND OTHER CRITICAL ACCOUNTING POLICIES The preparation of financial statements in conformity with U.S. generally accepted accounting principles requires management to make estimates and assumptions that affect the reported amounts of assets and liabilities at the date of the financial statements and revenues and expenses during the period. Significant accounting policies employed by the Company, including the use of estimates, are presented in the Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements. Critical accounting estimates involved in applying the Company accounting policies are those that require management to make assumptions about matters that are highly uncertain at the time the accounting estimate was made and those for which different estimates reasonably could have been 27 used for the current period, or changes in the accounting estimate that are reasonably likely to occur from period to period, and would have a material impact on the presentation of the Company financial condition, changes in financial condition or results of operations. The Company most critical accounting estimates, discussed below, pertain to accounting policies for accounts receivable trade, accrued liabilities and pension and other post-retirement benefit plans. Accounts Receivable Trade In the normal course of business, the Company extends credit to customers that satisfy pre-defined credit criteria. The Company believes that it has little concentration of credit risk due to the diversity of its customer base. Accounts Receivable Trade, as shown on the Consolidated Balance Sheets, were net of allowances and anticipated discounts. An allowance for doubtful accounts is determined through analysis of the aging of accounts receivable at the date of the financial statements, assessments of collectibility based on historical trends and an evaluation of the impact of current and projected economic conditions. The Company monitors the collectibility of its accounts receivable on an ongoing basis by analyzing the aging of its accounts receivable, assessing the credit worthiness of its customers and evaluating the impact of reasonably likely changes in economic conditions that may impact credit risks. Estimates with regard to the collectibility of accounts receivable are reasonably likely to change in the future. Over the three-year period ended December 31, 2004, the Company recorded expense averaging approximately $1.4 million per year for potential uncollectible accounts, including a $5.0 million provision in 2003 related to the estimate of probable exposure to the bankruptcy of one of the Company customers, Fleming Companies, Inc. This provision was reversed in the fourth quarter of 2004 upon the agreement with Fleming Reclamation Creditor Trust which resolved most significant matters related to the bankruptcy. Write-offs of uncollectible accounts, net of recoveries, averaged approximately $2.0 million over the same period. The provision for uncollectible accounts is recognized as selling, marketing and administrative expense in the Consolidated Statements of Income. Over the past three years, the allowance for doubtful accounts has ranged from 2% to 3% of gross accounts receivable. If reasonably possible near-term changes in the most material assumptions were made with regard to the collectibility of accounts receivable, the amounts by which the annual provision would have changed would have resulted in a reduction in expense of approximately $2.5 million to an increase in expense of approximately $1.4 million. Changes in estimates for future uncollectible accounts receivable would not have a material impact on the Company liquidity or capital resources. Accrued Liabilities Accrued liabilities requiring the most difficult or subjective judgments include liabilities associated with marketing promotion programs and potentially unsaleable products. The Company utilizes numerous trade promotion programs. The costs of such programs are recognized as a reduction to net sales with the recording of a corresponding accrued liability based on estimates at the time of product shipment. The accrued liability for marketing promotions is determined through analysis of programs offered, historical trends, expectations regarding customer and consumer participation, sales and payment trends, and experience with payment patterns associated with similar programs that had been previously offered. The estimated costs of these programs are reasonably likely to change in the future as a result of changes in trends with regard to customer and consumer participation, particularly for new programs and for programs related to the introduction of new products. Promotional costs were $557.5 million, $551.2 million and $461.6 million in 2004, 2003 and 2002, respectively. Reasonably possible near-term changes in the most material assumptions regarding the cost of promotional programs would have resulted in changes ranging from a reduction in such costs of approximately $12.0 million to an increase in costs of approximately $10.0 million, with an increase or decrease to net sales and income before income taxes within that range. Over the last three years, actual promotion costs have not deviated from the estimated amounts by more than 4%. Changes in estimates related to the cost of promotion programs would not have a material impact on the Company liquidity or capital resources. 28 At the time of sale, the Company estimates a cost for the possibility that products will become aged or unsaleable in the future. The estimated cost is included as a reduction to net sales. A related accrued liability is determined using statistical analysis that incorporates historical sales trends, seasonal timing and sales patterns, and product movement at retail. Estimates for costs associated with unsaleable products may change as a result of inventory levels in the distribution channel, current economic trends, changes in consumer demand, the introduction of new products and changes in trends of seasonal sales in response to promotion programs. Over the three-year period ended December 31, 2004, costs associated with aged or unsaleable products have amounted to approximately 2% of gross sales. Reasonably possible near-term changes in the most material assumptions regarding the estimates of such costs would have increased or decreased net sales and income before income taxes in a range from $.5 million to $1.0 million. In each of the years in the three-year period ended December 31, 2004, actual costs have not deviated from the Company estimates by more than 1%. Reasonably possible near-term changes in the estimates of costs associated with unsaleable products would not have a material impact on the Company liquidity or capital resources. Pension and Other Post-Retirement Benefit Plans The Company sponsors a number of defined benefit pension plans. The principal plans are the Hershey Foods Corporation Retirement Plan and the Hershey Foods Corporation Retirement Plan for Hourly Employees which are cash balance plans that provide pension benefits for most domestic employees. The Company is monitoring legislative and regulatory developments regarding cash balance plans, as well as recent court cases, for any impact on its plans. The Company also sponsors two primary post-retirement benefit plans. The health care plan is contributory, with participants contributions adjusted annually, and the life insurance plan is non-contributory. The Company policy is to fund domestic pension liabilities in accordance with the minimum and maximum limits imposed by the Employee Retirement Income Security Act of 1974 and Federal income tax laws, respectively. Non-domestic pension liabilities are funded in accordance with applicable local laws and regulations. Plan assets are invested in a broadly diversified portfolio consisting primarily of domestic and international common stocks and fixed income securities. Short-term and long-term liabilities associated with benefit plans are primarily determined based on actuarial calculations. These calculations are made considering payroll and employee data, including age and years of service, along with actuarial assumptions at the date of the financial statements. The Company takes into consideration long-term projections with regard to economic conditions, including interest rates, return on assets and the rate of increase in compensation levels. With regard to liabilities associated with other post-retirement benefit plans that provide health care and life insurance, the Company takes into consideration the long-term annual rate of increase in the per capita cost of the covered benefits. In compliance with the provisions of Statement of Financial Accounting Standards No. 87, Employers Accounting for Pensions, and Statement of Financial Accounting Standards No. 106, Employers Accounting for Postretirement Benefits Other Than Pensions, the discount rate assumption is reviewed and may be revised annually. The expected long-term rate of return on assets assumption ( asset return assumption ) for funded plans is by its nature of a longer duration and would be revised only when long-term asset return projections demonstrate that need. Pension Plans The net periodic pension benefits cost for the Company sponsored plans was $33.6 million, $51.0 million and $29.8 million, respectively, in 2004, 2003 and 2002. For 2005, net periodic pension benefits cost is expected to be comparable to 2004 primarily due to a higher than expected return on plan assets during 2004 and cash contributions to the pension plans in 2005, offset by the lower 2005 discount rate. The recognized net actuarial losses will be higher in 2005 due to the lower discount rate. Actuarial gains and losses may arise when actual experience differs from assumed experience or when the actuarial assumptions used to value the plan obligations are revised from time to time. The Company policy is to amortize only unrecognized net actuarial gains/losses in excess of 10% 29 of the respective plan projected benefit obligation, or fair market value of assets, if greater. The estimated recognized net actuarial loss component of net periodic pension benefits cost for 2005 is $10.0 million based on the December 31, 2004 unrecognized net actuarial loss presented in Note 13, Pension and Other Post-Retirement Benefit Plans, of $243.9 million and an amortization period of primarily between thirteen and fifteen years, the average remaining service period of active employees expected to receive benefits under the plans ( average remaining service period ). Changes to the assumed rates of participant termination, disability and retirement would impact the average remaining service period. An increase in these rates would decrease the average remaining service period and a decrease in these rates would have the opposite effect. However, changes to these assumed rates are not anticipated at this time. The 2004 recognized net actuarial loss component of net periodic pension benefits cost was $9.8 million. Projections beyond 2005 are dependent on a variety of factors such as changes to the discount rate and the actual return on pension plan assets. The Company used an average discount rate assumption of 6.0%, 6.3% and 6.9% for 2004, 2003 and 2002, respectively, in the calculation of net periodic pension benefits cost for its plans. The use of a different discount rate assumption can significantly impact net periodic pension benefits cost. A one percentage point decrease in the discount rate assumption would have increased 2004 net periodic pension benefits cost by $12.0 million and a one percentage point increase in the discount rate assumption would have decreased 2004 net periodic pension benefits cost by $10.2 million. The Company discount rate represents the estimated rate at which pension benefits could be effectively settled. In order to estimate this rate, the Company considers the yields of high quality securities, which are generally considered to be those receiving a rating no lower than the second highest given by a recognized rating agency. The Company reduced its average discount rate assumption to 5.7% for valuing obligations as of December 31, 2004, from 6.0% as of December 31, 2003, due to the declining interest rate environment. A one percentage point decrease in the discount rate assumption would have increased the December 31, 2004 pension benefits obligations by $125.0 million and a one percentage point increase in the discount rate assumption would have decreased the December 31, 2004 pension benefits obligations by $106.1 million. Asset return assumptions of 8.5%, 8.5% and 9.5% were used in the calculation of net periodic pension benefits cost for 2004, 2003 and 2002, respectively, and the expected return on plan assets component of net periodic pension benefits cost was based on the fair market value of pension plan assets. To determine the expected return on plan assets, the Company considers the current and expected asset allocations, as well as historical and expected returns on the categories of plan assets. The historical geometric average return over the 17 years prior to December 31, 2004 was approximately 9.7%. The actual return on assets was 10.7% during 2004, with gains during 2003 of approximately 21.1% and losses during 2002 of (13.1)%. The use of a different asset return assumption can significantly impact net periodic pension benefits cost. A one percentage point decrease in the asset return assumption would have increased 2004 net periodic pension benefits cost by $9.0 million and a one percentage point increase in the asset return assumption would have decreased 2004 net periodic pension benefits cost by $9.0 million. The Company pension asset investment policies specify ranges of pension asset allocation percentages for each asset class. The ranges for the domestic pension plans were as follows: equity securities, 40% 85%; debt securities, 15% 60%; and cash, 0% 10%. As of December 31, 2004, the actual allocations were within the ranges. The level of volatility in pension plan asset returns is expected to be in line with the overall volatility of the markets and weightings within the asset classes disclosed. For 2004 and 2003, the Company had no minimum funding requirements for the domestic plans and minimum funding requirements for the non-domestic plans were not material. However, the Company made contributions of $8.0 million in 2004 and $120.3 million in 2003 to improve the funded status. These contributions were fully tax deductible. A one percentage point change in the discount rate or asset return assumptions would not have changed the 2004 minimum funding requirements for the domestic plans. 30 For 2005, there will be no minimum funding requirements for the domestic plans and minimum funding requirements for the non-domestic plans will not be material. However, the Company contributed $40.0 million to the domestic plans in January 2005 to improve the funded status. Post-Retirement Benefit Plans Other post-retirement benefits costs relate primarily to health care and life insurance benefits. Net periodic other post-retirement benefits costs for the Company sponsored plans were $24.3 million, $23.9 million and $23.7 million in 2004, 2003 and 2002, respectively. For the calculation of net periodic other post-retirement benefits costs, discount rate assumptions of 6.0%, 6.3% and 7.0% were used for 2004, 2003 and 2002, respectively. The use of a different discount rate assumption can significantly impact net periodic other post-retirement benefits costs. A one percentage point decrease in the discount rate assumption would have increased 2004 net periodic other post-retirement benefits costs by $1.5 million and a one percentage point increase in the discount rate assumption would have decreased 2004 net periodic other post-retirement benefits costs by $1.3 million. The Company used discount rate assumptions of 5.7% and 6.0% to value the other post-retirement benefits obligations as of December 31, 2004 and 2003, respectively. A one percentage point decrease in the discount rate assumption would have increased the December 31, 2004 other post-retirement benefits obligations by $36.4 million and a one percentage point increase in the discount rate assumption would have decreased the December 31, 2004 other post-retirement benefits obligations by $30.4 million. On December 8, 2003, the President of the United States signed into law the Medicare Prescription Drug, Improvement and Modernization Act of 2003 (the 2003 Medicare Act ). The 2003 Medicare Act introduced a prescription drug benefit under Medicare ( Medicare Part D ) as well as a Federal subsidy to sponsors of retiree health care benefit plans that provide a benefit that is at least actuarially equivalent to Medicare Part D. The Company believes that certain prescription drug benefits offered under post-retirement health care plans will qualify for the subsidy under Medicare Part D. The Federal subsidy to be provided by the 2003 Medicare Act reduced net periodic benefits costs in 2004 by approximately $3.0 million and lowered the accumulated post-retirement benefits obligation by approximately $25.2 million. Other critical accounting policies employed by the Company include the following: Goodwill and Other Intangible Assets The Company accounts for goodwill and other intangible assets in accordance with Statement of Financial Accounting Standards No. 142, Goodwill and Other Intangible Assets. Other intangible assets consist primarily of trademarks, customer-related intangible assets and patents obtained through business acquisitions. The useful lives of trademarks were determined to be indefinite and, therefore, these assets are not being amortized. Customer-related intangible assets are being amortized over their estimated useful lives of approximately ten years. Patents are being amortized over their remaining legal lives of approximately sixteen years. The impairment evaluation for goodwill is conducted annually, or more frequently if events or changes in circumstances indicate that an asset might be impaired. The evaluation is performed by using a two-step process. In the first step, the fair value of each reporting unit is compared with the carrying amount of the reporting unit, including goodwill. The estimated fair value of the reporting unit is generally determined on the basis of discounted future cash flows. If the estimated fair value of the reporting unit is less than the carrying amount of the reporting unit, then a second step must be completed in order to determine the amount of the goodwill impairment that should be recorded. In the second step, the implied fair value of the reporting unit goodwill is determined by allocating the reporting unit fair value to all of its assets and liabilities other than goodwill (including any unrecognized intangible assets) in a manner similar to a purchase price allocation. The resulting 31 implied fair value of the goodwill that results from the application of this second step is then compared to the carrying amount of the goodwill and an impairment charge is recorded for the difference. The evaluation of the carrying amount of intangible assets with indefinite lives is conducted annually, or more frequently if events or changes in circumstances indicate that an asset might be impaired. The evaluation is performed by comparing the carrying amount of these assets to their estimated fair value. If the estimated fair value is less than the carrying amount of the intangible assets with indefinite lives, then an impairment charge is recorded to reduce the asset to its estimated fair value. The estimated fair value is generally determined on the basis of discounted future cash flows. The assumptions used in the estimate of fair value are generally consistent with the past performance of each reporting unit and are also consistent with the projections and assumptions that are used in current operating plans. Such assumptions are subject to change as a result of changing economic and competitive conditions. Goodwill was assigned to reporting units and transitional impairment tests were performed for goodwill and other intangible assets during the first quarter of 2002 and the annual impairment tests were performed in the fourth quarters of 2002, 2003 and 2004. No impairment of assets was determined as a result of these tests. Commodities Futures Contracts In connection with the purchasing of cocoa, sugar, corn sweeteners, natural gas, fuel oil and certain dairy products for anticipated manufacturing requirements and to hedge transportation costs, the Company enters into commodities futures contracts as deemed appropriate to reduce the effect of price fluctuations. Commodities futures contracts utilized by the Company are designated and accounted for as cash flow hedges under SFAS No. 133, as amended. Additional information with regard to accounting policies associated with derivative instruments is contained in Note 6, Derivative Instruments and Hedging Activities. The net after-tax impact of cash flow hedging derivatives on comprehensive income (loss) reflected a $16.3 million gain in 2004, a $20.2 million loss in 2003 and a $106.7 million gain in 2002. Net gains and losses on cash flow hedging derivatives were primarily associated with commodities futures contracts. Reclassification adjustments from accumulated other comprehensive income (loss) to income, for gains or losses on cash flow hedging derivatives, were reflected in cost of sales. Reclassification of gains of $26.1 million, $51.9 million, and $17.9 million for 2004, 2003 and 2002, respectively, were associated with commodities futures contracts. Gains on commodities futures contracts recognized in cost of sales as a result of hedge ineffectiveness were approximately $.4 million, $.4 million and $1.5 million before tax for the years ended December 31, 2004, 2003 and 2002, respectively. No gains or losses on cash flow hedging derivatives were reclassified from accumulated other comprehensive income (loss) into income as a result of the discontinuance of a hedge because it became probable that a hedged forecasted transaction would not occur. There were no components of gains or losses on cash flow hedging derivatives that were recognized in income because such components were excluded from the assessment of hedge effectiveness. The amount of net gains on cash flow hedging derivatives, including foreign exchange forward contracts and options, interest rate swap agreements and commodities futures contracts, expected to be reclassified into earnings in the next twelve months was approximately $18.7 million after tax as of December 31, 2004, which were principally associated with commodities futures contracts. RETURN MEASURES Operating Return on Average Stockholders Equity The Company operating return on average stockholders equity, on a GAAP basis, was 49.9% in 2004. The Company adjusted operating return on average stockholders equity was 44.7% in 2004. For the purpose of calculating the adjusted operating return on average stockholders equity, earnings is defined as net income adjusted to reflect the impact of the elimination of the amortization of 32 intangibles for all years and excluding the impact of the adjustment to income tax contingency reserves on the provision for income taxes in 2004, the after-tax effect of the business realignment initiatives in 2003, 2002 and 2001, the after-tax effect of incremental expenses to explore the possible sale of the Company in 2002 and the after-tax gains on the sale of a group of the Company gum brands in 2003, the sale of the Luden throat drops business in 2001, the sale of corporate aircraft in 2000 and the sale of the pasta business in 1999. Over the most recent six-year period, the adjusted return has ranged from 28.9% in 1999 to 44.7% in 2004. Operating Return on Average Invested Capital The Company operating return on average invested capital, on a GAAP basis, was 26.7% in 2004. The Company adjusted operating return on average invested capital was 24.1% in 2004. Average invested capital consists of the annual average of beginning and ending balances of long-term debt, deferred income taxes and stockholders equity. For the purpose of calculating the adjusted operating return on average invested capital, earnings is defined as net income adjusted to reflect the impact of the elimination of the amortization of intangibles for all years and excluding the impact of the adjustment to income tax contingency reserves on the provision for income taxes in 2004, the after-tax effect of the business realignment initiatives in 2003, 2002 and 2001, the after-tax effect of incremental expenses to explore the possible sale of the Company in 2002, the after-tax gains on the sale of a group of the Company gum brands in 2003, the sale of the Luden throat drops business in 2001, the sale of corporate aircraft in 2000, and the sale of the pasta business in 1999, and the after-tax effect of interest on long-term debt. Over the most recent six-year period, the adjusted return has ranged from 15.4% in 1999 to 24.1% in 2004. OUTLOOK The outlook section contains a number of forward-looking statements, all of which are based on current expectations. Actual results may differ materially. Key risks to achieving future performance include: the continued ability to accelerate the introduction of new products, while balancing the rationalization of under-performing items; customer and consumer acceptance of announced price increases; achievement of targeted cost improvements; successful resolution of upcoming labor contract negotiations; intensified competitive activity in certain markets; changes to customers businesses and in the retail environment; changes in the regulatory environment, which includes tax laws as well as initiatives which could restrict or limit certain product sales; the ability to improve profitability of international businesses which are subject to certain volatility with regard to the economic and foreign currency exchange environment in certain countries; and the risk of increases in raw material and other costs. During the three years ended December 31, 2004, the Company significantly improved operating results as it implemented its strategies. Over the long-term these strategies seek to deliver average net sales growth of 3% 4% per year, gross margin improvement of 70 90 basis points per year, 7% 9% annual growth in earnings before interest expense and income taxes ( EBIT ) and 9% 11% earnings per share-diluted ( EPS ) growth per year. The Company expects continued sales growth in 2005 to be 6% 7%, including growth at the top end of its long-term goal for the ongoing business, enhanced by the first year impact of the Mauna Loa and Grupo Lorena acquisitions. The Company will continue to introduce new items and limited edition line extensions. During 2005 these will include a full year of sales for the following items that were introduced in 2004: Hershey Kisses brand filled with caramel milk chocolates, Ice Breakers Liquid Ice mints, Hershey Snack Barz rice and marshmallow bars, Hershey SmartZone nutrition bars, Take5 candy bars, Hershey s, Almond Joy, York and Reese cookies, Reese Pieces candy with peanuts, and Reese Big Cup , previously sold as a limited edition item. Geographically, net sales growth is expected to be concentrated primarily in North America. Growth outside North America will be focused on limited geographic areas offering attractive market opportunities. 33 Gross margin is expected to improve 30 40 basis points in 2005, including growth approaching the lower end of the Company long-term goal of 70 90 basis points for the ongoing business, reduced by the impact of integrating the lower margin Grupo Lorena and Mauna Loa businesses. Margin improvement is affected by various factors, including selling prices, promotional allowances, raw material costs, supply chain efficiencies and the mix of products sold in any period. During 2005, improved price realization resulting from a combination of selling price increases and product weight changes, combined with improved supply chain efficiencies will more than offset higher input costs, primarily for raw materials, transportation and employee benefits. EBIT is expected to grow within the range of the long-term goal in 2005, as a result of the net sales growth and gross margin expansion, combined with careful control of selling, marketing and administrative costs. Net income and EPS in 2004 benefited from the non-recurring adjustment to income tax contingency reserves, which reduced the tax rate and income tax expense. In 2005, the tax rate will return to a more normal rate, estimated at 36.6%, offsetting the EBIT gains and resulting in relatively flat net income and EPS versus 2004. Excluding the impact of this non-recurring adjustment, net income and EPS are expected to increase within the range of the Company long-term goals. The Company expects strong cash flows from operating activities in 2005. Net cash provided from operating activities is expected to exceed cash requirements for capital additions, capitalized software additions and anticipated dividend payments. The Company will continue to monitor the funded status of pension plans based on market performance and make future contributions as appropriate. The plans were sufficiently funded at the end of 2004, however, in January 2005, a contribution of $40.0 million was made to improve the funded status of the domestic plans. The Company cash flow from operations is expected to remain strong. During 2005, the Company will repay the $201.2 million of 6.7% Notes due in 2005 by utilizing cash provided from operations and additional short-term borrowings. NEW ACCOUNTING PRONOUNCEMENTS In December 2004, the FASB issued Statement of Financial Accounting Standards No. 123R, Share-Based Payment, an amendment of FASB Statements No. 123 and 95 ( SFAS No. 123R ). SFAS No. 123R addresses the accounting for transactions in which an enterprise exchanges its valuable equity instruments for employee services. It also addresses transactions in which an enterprise incurs liabilities that are based on the fair value of the enterprise equity instruments or that may be settled by the issuance of those equity instruments in exchange for employee services. For public entities, the cost of employee services received in exchange for equity instruments, including employee stock options, would be measured based on the grant-date fair value of those instruments. That cost would be recognized as compensation expense over the requisite service period (often the vesting period). Generally, no compensation cost would be recognized for equity instruments that do not vest. SFAS No. 123R is effective for periods beginning after June 15, 2005. SFAS No. 123R will apply to awards granted, modified, or settled in cash on or after that date. Companies may choose from one of three methods when transitioning to the new standard, which may include restatement of prior annual and interim periods. The impact on EPS of expensing stock options will be dependent upon the method to be used for valuation of stock options and the transition method determined by the Company. The total impact on an annualized basis could range from approximately $.06 to $.08 per share-diluted, assuming option grants continue at the same level as in 2004. 34 In November 2004, the FASB issued Statement of Financial Accounting Standards No. 151, Inventory Costs, an amendment of ARB No. 43, Chapter 4 ( SFAS No. 151 ). SFAS No. 151 amends the guidance in ARB No. 43, Chapter 4, Inventory Pricing, to clarify the accounting for abnormal amounts of idle facility expense, freight, handling costs, and wasted material (spoilage). Paragraph 5 of ARB No. 43, Chapter 4, previously stated that ...under some circumstances, items such as idle facility expense, excessive spoilage, double freight, and rehandling costs may be so abnormal as to require treatment as current period charges... SFAS No. 151 requires that those items be recognized as current-period charges regardless of whether they meet the criterion of so abnormal. In addition, SFAS No. 151 requires that allocation of fixed production overheads to the costs of conversion be based on the normal capacity of the production facilities. The Company does not expect any significant changes to its financial accounting and reporting as a result of the implementation of SFAS No. 151.
