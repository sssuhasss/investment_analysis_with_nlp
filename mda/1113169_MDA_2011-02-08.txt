Item 7. Management Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations. GENERAL. Our revenues and net income are derived primarily from investment advisory services provided to individual and institutional investors in our sponsored mutual funds and other managed investment portfolios. Investment advisory clients outside the United States account for 12.5% of our assets under management at December 31, 2010. We manage a broad range of U.S., international and global stock, bond, and money market mutual funds and other investment portfolios, which meet the varied needs and objectives of individual and institutional investors. Investment advisory revenues depend largely on the total value and composition of assets under our management. Accordingly, fluctuations in financial markets and in the composition of assets under management affect our revenues and results of operations. On January 20, 2010, we purchased a 26% equity interest in UTI Asset Management Company and an affiliate from existing stockholders for 6.5 billion Indian rupees (INR), or $142.4 million, plus transaction costs of $3.2 million of which a portion was paid in 2009. We repurchased 5.0 million shares of our common stock for $240.0 million in 2010. We funded the investment in UTI and the share repurchases with existing cash balances and cash generated from operations. The low interest rate environment experienced in 2010 led us to continue voluntarily waiving money market advisory fees to maintain a zero or positive yield for fund investors. We waived $25.1 million in 2010 compared to $5.7 million in 2009 and anticipate these fee waivers will continue into 2011. We made a one-time contribution of $16.4 million in November 2010, to certain of our sponsored money market mutual funds to offset the effect of cumulative net losses realized by those funds in past years in order to allay any fund shareholder concerns that might arise because of new SEC disclosure rules. The charge associated with this one-time contribution is included in other operating expenses. - 15 - BACKGROUND. Against a backdrop of healthy earnings, strong balance sheets, and low borrowing costs for corporations, major U.S. equity indexes rose strongly in 2010, capping a second consecutive year of solid gains. Stocks produced robust returns through late April, extending the rally that started in March 2009, but fell sharply through early July due in part to concern around the European sovereign debt crisis, a sluggish U.S. economic recovery, and the flash crash in U.S. stock prices on May 6. Equities rebounded strongly beginning in late August as the economy showed signs of improvement and the Federal Reserve gave reassurance that they would employ non-traditional monetary policy tools, as needed, to promote economic recovery. The market continued to rally through the fourth quarter, as the Federal Reserve proved their willingness to act by initiating a second round of quantitative easing since the 2008 financial crisis. They announced plans to purchase an additional $600 billion in Treasuries by mid-2011 in an attempt to keep longer-term interest rates low. Bipartisan legislation in mid-December that extended for two years the Bush-era tax cuts that were set to expire at the end of 2010 helped lift major indexes to their highest levels of the year. In this environment, the S&P 500 Index of large-cap companies in leading industries of the U.S. economy returned 15.1% in 2010, while the NASDAQ Composite Index, which is heavily weighted with technology companies, returned 16.9% (excluding dividends). The returns in developed non-U.S. equity markets were mixed as strong Asian market performance was offset by weaker results in Europe, where markets struggled with concerns over the sovereign debt crisis. As developed markets dealt with economic pressures, emerging equity markets produced strong returns, with countries in the emerging Europe, Middle East, and Africa (EMEA) regions faring the best. The MSCI Emerging Markets Index returned 19.2% versus 8.2% for the MSCI EAFE Index, which measures the performance of mostly large-cap stocks in Europe, Australasia, and the Far East. The Federal Reserve target funds rate remained in the range of 0.00% to 0.25% throughout 2010, where it has been since late 2008. This historically low rate along with the slowdown in the economy during the spring and the European debt crisis placed strong downward pressure on Treasury yields as investors sought the safety of Treasuries. Treasury yields began to rise in late fall in response to the Federal Reserve additional stimulus and a stronger economic climate, but most of the yield curve ended the year still below their levels at the end of 2009. The yield on the benchmark 10-year U.S. Treasury at December 31, 2010, was 3.3%, a decrease of 55 basis points from the end of 2009. U.S. fixed income securities realized modest gains in 2010. High yield bonds significantly outperformed investment-grade issues, as investors sought higher returns in the low interest rate environment. The Credit Suisse High Yield Index gained 14.4% in 2010, while the Barclays Capital U.S. Aggregate Index gained 6.5%. A similar trend was seen in the non-U.S. bond markets, as investors sought riskier bonds issued by emerging market countries over the high-quality bonds issued in developed markets. The J.P. Morgan Emerging Markets Index Plus gained 11.8% in 2010, while the Barclays Capital Global Aggregate Ex-U.S. Dollar Bond Index was up 5.0%. In this environment, investors entrusted net inflows of $30.3 billion to our management in 2010. Total assets under our management increased $90.7 billion over the course of 2010 and ended the year at a record $482.0 billion, a substantial recovery from the $276.3 billion at the end of 2008 and an increase of 21% from the previous record year-end high of $400.0 billion at the end of 2007. Our assets under management (in billions) have changed during the past three years as follows: 2008 2009 2010 Assets under management at beginning of year $ 400.0 $ 276.3 $ 391.3 Net cash inflows Sponsored mutual funds in the U.S. 3.9 12.5 13.6 Other portfolios 13.2 10.2 16.7 17.1 22.7 30.3 Net market gains (losses) and income (140.3 ) 92.7 60.8 Mutual fund distributions not reinvested (.5 ) (.4 ) (.4 ) Increase (decrease) during year (123.7 ) 115.0 90.7 Assets under management at end of year $ 276.3 $ 391.3 $ 482.0 Over the last three years, our net cash inflows have been sourced most significantly from third-party financial intermediaries and from institutional investors around the world. Our relative investment performance over much of this period and brand awareness contributed significantly to attracting net inflows across each of our four distribution channels. - 16 - Assets under management at December 31, 2010, include $360.6 billion in equity and blended asset investment portfolios and $121.4 billion in fixed income investment portfolios. The investment portfolios that we manage consist of $282.6 billion in the T. Rowe Price mutual funds distributed in the United States and $199.4 billion in other investment portfolios, including separately managed accounts, subadvised funds, and other sponsored investment funds offered to investors outside the U.S. and through variable annuity life insurance plans. We incur significant expenditures to attract new investment advisory clients and additional investments from our existing clients. These efforts may often involve costs that precede any future revenues that we may recognize from increases to our assets under management. RESULTS OF OPERATIONS. 2010 versus 2009. Investment advisory revenues were up 31.1%, or $480.7 million, to $2.0 billion in 2010, as average assets under our management increased $101.3 billion to $422.6 billion. The average annualized fee rate earned on our assets under management was 48.0 basis points during 2010, virtually unchanged from the 48.1 basis points earned in 2009, including the effect of the voluntary fee waivers made to our money market funds. Net revenues increased $499.8 million, or 26.8%, to nearly $2.4 billion. Operating expenses were $1.3 billion in 2010, an increase of $164.9 million, or 14.1%. This increase includes the $16.4 million charge related to the one-time contribution made to certain of our money market funds. Overall, net operating income for 2010 increased $334.9 million, or 47.7%, to more than $1.0 billion. The increase in our average assets under management and resulting advisory revenue increased our operating margin for 2010 to 43.8% from 37.6% for 2009. We recognized non-operating investment income of $33.5 million in 2010 compared to investment losses in 2009 of $12.7 million. The 2009 year included $36.1 million in other than temporary impairment charges recognized in the first quarter on our investments in sponsored mutual funds. Net income increased $238.6 million, or 55%, to $672.2 million from the 2009 period resulting in diluted earnings per share on our common stock to increase 53% to $2.53 from the $1.65 earned in 2009. Investment advisory revenues earned from the T. Rowe Price mutual funds distributed in the United States increased 30.5%, or $326.0 million, to nearly $1.4 billion. Average mutual fund assets in 2010 were $250.8 billion, an increase of 30.8% from the 2009 average. Net inflows to the mutual funds during 2010 were $13.6 billion, including $5.9 billion originating in our target-date Retirement Funds. Fund net inflow amounts are presented net of $1.0 billion that was transferred to our target-date retirement trusts from the Retirement Funds. Our bond funds had net inflows of $7.7 billion. The New Income Fund had net inflows of $2.2 billion and the Short-Term Bond Fund added $1.4 billion. The stock and blended asset funds added $6.3 billion of net inflows, including $1.4 billion into the Value Fund. The Mid-Cap Value, Equity Income, Institutional Large-Cap Growth and Dividend Growth Funds each added more than $500 million for a combined total of $2.2 billion in net inflows. The money market funds had net outflows of $400 million. Higher market valuations and income increased fund assets by $36.3 billion. Investment advisory revenues earned on the other investment portfolios that we manage increased $154.7 million, or 32.4%, to $632.5 million. Average assets in these portfolios were $171.8 billion during 2010, an increase of $42.3 billion, or 32.7% from the 2009 year. Net inflows primarily from institutional investors and third party financial intermediaries were $16.7 billion, while market appreciation and income added $24.1 billion. These net inflows were invested primarily in our equity mandates, though we also saw strong demand for our fixed income strategies. Net inflows include a transfer of $1.0 billion from the target-date Retirement Funds. Administrative fees increased $18.7 million to $337.5 million in 2010. The change in these revenues includes a $12.2 million increase of 12b-1 distribution and service fees recognized on higher assets under management in the Advisor and R classes of our sponsored mutual funds. Increases in our mutual fund servicing and defined contribution plan revenues of $10.2 million were offset by a $3.7 million decrease in brokerage fees due to a reduction in per-trade commissions charged beginning July 1, 2010, to customers with substantial assets. Changes in administrative fees are generally offset by similar changes in related operating expenses that are incurred to provide services to the funds and their investors. Compensation and related costs, increased $87.0 million, or 11.2%, compared to 2009. The largest part of the change is attributable to a $63.9 million increase in our annual variable compensation programs. Greater use of outside contractors increased our 2010 costs by $14.1 million with the remainder of the change primarily attributable to higher other employee benefits and employee related costs. At December 31, 2010, we employed 5,052 associates, an increase of 5.2% from the end of 2009, to support both business growth and added capabilities. - 17 - Advertising and promotion expenditures were up $13.7 million, or 18.7%, compared to 2009 in response to investor interest in recovering markets over the last twelve months. We currently estimate that advertising and promotion expenditures for 2011 could increase about 15% from 2010 levels. We vary our level of spending based on market conditions and investor demand as well as our efforts to expand our investor base globally. Occupancy and facility costs together with depreciation expense increased $4.1 million, or 2.4%, versus 2009. The amount of office space occupied, and the operating costs of our facilities have all risen to meet increased business demands. These increasing business demands have also led us to upgrade our technology capabilities and related maintenance programs. Other operating expenses increased $60.1 million, or 39.6%, from 2009. This increase includes a $16.4 million charge related to the one-time contribution made to certain money market funds to offset the effects of cumulative net losses realized in recent years. Higher average assets in 2010 increased the distribution and service expense of our Advisor and R classes of mutual fund shares that are sourced from financial intermediaries. These costs are offset by an equal increase in our administrative revenues recognized from the 12b-1 fees discussed above. The remaining increase is a result of other operating costs, including consulting fees, travel costs and other professional services, incurred to meet increasing business demands. Our non-operating investment income activity resulted in a net gain of $33.5 million in 2010, compared to a net loss of $12.7 million in the 2009 period. This change of $46.2 million includes $36.1 million in other than temporary impairments recognized on our investments in sponsored mutual funds in 2009. The change also includes $1.3 million in more gains recognized in the 2010 period for the settlement and valuation of a series of non-deliverable forward contracts used to economically hedge the foreign currency exposure associated with the UTI acquisition price and $5.3 million in net earnings from our investment in UTI. The 2010 provision for income taxes as a percentage of pretax income is 37.2%. The 2010 income tax provision includes nonrecurring discrete benefits of .4% related to the settlement of prior years state income tax positions and .2% from the firm reorganization of its international entities, which was completed to help realize additional operational efficiencies. The firm currently estimates its effective rate for 2011 will be about 37.8%. 2009 versus 2008 . Investment advisory revenues were down 12%, or $215 million, to more than $1.5 billion in 2009, as average assets under our management of $321.3 billion in 2009 were $36.9 billion lower than in 2008. The average annualized fee rate earned on our assets under management was 48.1 basis points during 2009, down from the 49.2 basis points earned during 2008. Lower equity market valuations resulted in an increase in the percentage of our assets under management being attributable to lower fee fixed income portfolios, including money market funds for which we reduced advisory fees in order to maintain yields at or above 0% to fund investors. Net revenues decreased 12%, or $249 million, to nearly $1.9 billion. Operating expenses fell 8%, or $102 million, to almost $1.2 billion in 2009. Overall, net operating income in 2009 decreased $147 million, or 17%, to $702 million. Our operating margin declined to 37.6% in 2009 from 40.1% in 2008, as the impact of lower average market valuations over 2009, which decreased our assets under management and corresponding advisory revenues, was offset only partially by the savings from our cost reduction efforts. Our non-operating investment loss decreased nearly $40 million due to the higher other than temporary impairment charges recognized in 2008 on our investments in sponsored mutual funds. Net income fell 12%, or $57 million, to nearly $434 million. Diluted earnings per share on our common stock also decreased to $1.65, down 9% or $.16 from $1.81 in 2008. The retrospective application in 2009 of new financial reporting guidance that recognizes our outstanding restricted stock and stock units, on which we pay non-forfeitable dividends, as if they were a separate class of stock reduced previously reported 2008 diluted earnings per share on our common stock of $1.82 by $.01 per share. The non-operating charges to recognize other than temporary impairments of our fund investments reduced diluted earnings per share by $.21 in 2008 and $.09 in 2009. Investment advisory revenues earned from the T. Rowe Price mutual funds distributed in the United States decreased more than $170 million, or 14%, from 2008 to almost $1.1 billion. Average mutual fund assets were $191.8 billion in 2009, down 11% from the average of $216.1 billion during 2008. Net inflows to the mutual funds in 2009 were $12.5 billion, including $6.4 billion that originated from our target-date Retirement Funds. Our bond funds added $10.0 billion of net inflows, including $6.3 billion from four funds New Income, Short Term Bond, International Bond and Emerging Markets Bond that each added more than $1 billion during the year. The stock and blended asset funds had net inflows of $4.8 billion after the transfer of $1.3 billion to other investment portfolios under our management. The Equity Index 500 and Mid-Cap Growth funds had total net inflows of $2.5 billion in 2009. Our money market funds had net outflows of $2.3 billion during the year. Higher market valuations and income increased mutual fund assets under management by $55.8 billion in 2009. - 18 - Investment advisory revenues earned on the other investment portfolios that we manage decreased $44 million, or 8.5%, to $477.8 million in 2009. Average assets in these portfolios were $129.5 billion during 2009, down $12.6 billion or 9% from 2008. Other investment portfolio assets under management increased $46.7 billion during 2009, including $36.5 billion in market gains and income and $10.2 billion of net inflows, primarily from institutional investors. Net inflows include $1.3 billion transferred from the stock and blended asset mutual funds during 2009. Administrative fees decreased $35 million, or 10%, to $319 million in 2009. This change includes a $4 million decrease in 12b-1 distribution and service fees recognized on lower average assets under management in the Advisor and R classes of our sponsored mutual funds and a $31 million reduction in our mutual fund servicing revenue, which is primarily attributable to our cost reduction efforts in the mutual fund and retirement plan servicing functions. Changes in administrative fees are generally offset by similar changes in related operating expenses that are incurred to provide services to the funds and their investors. Our largest expense, compensation and related costs, decreased $42 million, or 5%, from 2008 to $773 million in 2009. The largest part of this decrease is attributable to a $19 million reduction in our annual bonus program. Reductions in the use of outside contractors lowered 2009 costs $14 million with the remainder of the cost savings primarily attributable to the workforce reduction and lower employee benefits and other employment expenses. Average headcount in 2009 was down 5.4% from 2008 due to attrition, retirements and our workforce reduction in April 2009. Advertising and promotion expenditures were down $31 million, or 30%, versus 2008 due to our decision to reduce spending in response to lower investor activity in the 2009 market environment. Depreciation expense and other occupancy and facility costs together increased $4 million, or 2.5% compared to 2008, as we moderated or delayed our capital spending and facility growth plans. Other operating expenses decreased $33 million, or 18% from 2008, including a decline of $4 million in distribution and service expenses recognized on lower average assets under management in our Advisor and R classes of mutual fund shares that are sourced from financial intermediaries. Our cost control efforts resulted in the remaining expense reductions, including lower professional fees and travel and related costs. Our non-operating investment activity resulted in net losses of $12.7 million in 2009 and $52.3 million in 2008. The improvement of nearly $40 million is primarily attributable to a reduction in the other than temporary impairments recognized on our investments in sponsored mutual funds in 2009 versus 2008. The following table details our related mutual fund investment gains and losses (in millions) during the two years ended December 31, 2009. 2008 2009 Change Other than temporary impairments recognized $ (91.3 ) $ (36.1 ) $ 55.2 Capital gain distributions received 5.6 2.0 (3.6 ) Net gain (loss) realized on fund dispositions (4.5 ) 7.4 11.9 Net loss recognized on fund holdings $ (90.2 ) $ (26.7 ) $ 63.5 Lower income of $16 million from our money market holdings due to the significantly lower interest rate environment offset the improvement experienced with our fund investments. The 2009 provision for income taxes as a percentage of pretax income is 37.1%, down from 38.4% in 2008. Our 2009 provision includes reductions of prior years tax provisions and discrete nonrecurring benefits that lowered our 2009 effective tax rate by 1.0%. CAPITAL RESOURCES AND LIQUIDITY. During 2010, stockholders equity increased from $2.9 billion to $3.3 billion. We repurchased nearly 5.0 million common shares for $240.0 million in 2010. Tangible book value is $2.6 billion at December 31, 2010, and our cash and cash equivalents and our mutual fund investment holdings total more than $1.5 billion. Given the availability of these financial resources, we do not maintain an available external source of liquidity. - 19 - At December 31, 2010, we had outstanding commitments to make additional contributions totaling $48.2 million to various investment partnerships in which we have an existing investment. We presently anticipate funding 2011 property and equipment expenditures of about $120 million from our cash balances and operating cash inflows. 2010 versus 2009 . Operating activities during 2010 provided cash flows of $732.8 million, up $197.2 million from 2009, including a $238.6 million increase in net income. Cash flows in 2009 also included the impact of $36.1 million in other than temporary impairments of our investments in sponsored mutual funds that did not recur in 2010. Net cash used in investing activities totaled $276.9 million, up $110.2 million from the 2009 period, primarily from the purchase of a 26% equity interest in UTI for $142.4 million plus related transaction costs incurred in the 2010 period of $1.2 million. We spent $15.9 million less in property and equipment expenditures in 2010 compared to 2009 due to the construction of our two new facilities in Owings Mills, Maryland being completed in late 2009. Net cash used in financing activities was $386.1 million in 2010, up $141.4 million from the 2009 period. We increased our stock repurchases by expending $169.0 million more in 2010 compared to the 2009 year. Dividends paid during 2010 increased $22.0 million from the 2009 period due primarily to a $.02 increase in our quarterly per-share dividend. These uses of cash are offset by $35.3 million more in cash proceeds from option exercises compared to 2009 as the higher market valuations of our common stock experienced in 2010 led employees to exercise. 2009 versus 2008 . Operating activities during 2009 provided cash flows of nearly $536 million, down $206 million from 2008, including a $57 million decrease in net income and a $129 million change in the timing differences in the cash settlement of our accounts receivable and accrued revenues and payables and accrued liabilities. In addition, our add back of the non-cash charges for other than temporary impairments of our investments in sponsored mutual funds was $55 million more in 2008 than in 2009. Net cash used in investing activities totaled $167 million in 2009, up $42 million from 2008. We made net investments of nearly $18 million into our mutual fund portfolio in 2009, an increase of $15 million from 2008. During 2009 and 2008, we made several changes, totaling more than $56 million in 2009 and $95 million in 2008, to the composition of our portfolio of mutual fund holdings in light of market conditions experienced during the period. Because of the smaller 2009 increase in savings bank deposits, we increased our investment in debt securities held by the savings bank by only $9 million in 2009 versus $41 million in 2008. In 2008, we liquidated our $70 million U.S. Treasury Notes portfolio thereby producing inflows of nearly $73 million that did not recur in 2009. Net cash used in financing activities was $245 million in 2009, down $538 million from 2008. Compared to 2008, we expended $543 million less to repurchase our common shares in 2009. The uncertain market environment in 2009 led us to reduce our share repurchases and preserve our liquid capital. Our $.01 per share quarterly dividend increase in 2009 accounts for an additional payout of $10 million in dividends; however, our 2008 change in policy regarding the timing of dividend payments such that our quarterly dividends are declared and paid in the same quarter resulted in five quarterly dividend payments in 2008 versus only four in 2009. This additional payment resulted in our 2009 outflows for dividends decreasing $64 million from 2008. Excess tax benefits from share-based compensation plans decreased $37 million as fewer stock option exercises due to uncertainties and lower market valuations of our common stock reduced our common stock issuances about 25% from 2008. CONTRACTUAL OBLIGATIONS. The following table presents a summary of our future obligations (in millions) under the terms of existing operating leases and other contractual cash purchase commitments at December 31, 2010. Other purchase commitments include contractual amounts that will be due for the purchase of goods or services to be used in our operations and may be cancelable at earlier times than those indicated, under certain conditions that may involve termination fees. Because these obligations are generally of a normal recurring nature, we expect that we will fund them from future cash flows from operations. The information presented does not include operating expenses or capital expenditures that will be committed in the normal course of operations in 2011 and future years. The information also excludes the $4 million of unrecognized tax benefits discussed in Note 9 to our consolidated financial statements because it is not possible to estimate the time period in which a payment might be made to the tax authorities. Total 2011 2012-13 2014-15 Later Noncancelable operating leases $ 194 $ 29 $ 56 $ 53 $ 56 Other purchase commitments 171 110 53 7 1 $ 365 $ 139 $ 109 $ 60 $ 57 We also have outstanding commitments to fund additional contributions to investment partnerships in which we have an existing investment totaling $48.2 million at December 31, 2010. CRITICAL ACCOUNTING POLICIES. The preparation of financial statements often requires the selection of specific accounting methods and policies from among several acceptable alternatives. Further, significant estimates and judgments may be required in selecting and applying those methods and policies in the recognition of the assets and liabilities in our balance sheet, the revenues and expenses in our statement of income, and the information that is contained in our significant accounting policies and notes to consolidated financial statements. Making these estimates and judgments requires the analysis of information concerning events that may not yet be complete and of facts and circumstances that may change over time. Accordingly, actual amounts or future results can differ materially from those estimates that we include currently in our consolidated financial statements, significant accounting policies, and notes. - 20 - We present those significant accounting policies used in the preparation of our consolidated financial statements as an integral part of those statements within this 2010 Annual Report. In the following discussion, we highlight and explain further certain of those policies that are most critical to the preparation and understanding of our financial statements. Other than temporary impairments of available-for-sale securities . We generally classify our investment holdings in sponsored mutual funds and the debt securities held for investment by our savings bank subsidiary as available-for-sale. At the end of each quarter, we mark the carrying amount of each investment holding to fair value and recognize an unrealized gain or loss as a component of comprehensive income within the statement of stockholders equity. We next review each individual security position that has an unrealized loss or impairment to determine if that impairment is other than temporary. A mutual fund holding with an impairment that has persisted daily throughout the six months between quarter-ends is generally presumed to have an other than temporary impairment and a loss is recognized in our statement of income unless there is persuasive evidence, such as an increase in value subsequent to quarter end, to overcome that presumption. We may also recognize an other than temporary loss of less than six months in our statement of income if the particular circumstances of the underlying investment do not warrant our belief that a near-term recovery is possible. An impaired debt security held by our savings bank subsidiary is considered to have an other-than-temporary loss that we will recognize in our statement of income if the impairment is caused by a change in credit quality that affects our ability to recover our amortized cost or if we intend to sell the security or believe that it is more likely than not that we will be required to sell the security before recovering cost. Minor impairments of 5% or less are generally considered temporary. Goodwill . We internally conduct, manage and report our operations as one investment advisory business. We do not have distinct operating segments or components that separately constitute a business. Accordingly, we attribute goodwill to a single reportable business segment and reporting unit our investment advisory business. We evaluate the carrying amount of goodwill in our balance sheet for possible impairment on an annual basis in the third quarter of each year using a fair value approach. Goodwill would be considered impaired whenever our historical carrying amount exceeds the fair value of our investment advisory business. Our annual testing has demonstrated that the fair value of our investment advisory business (our market capitalization) exceeds our carrying amount (our stockholders equity) and, therefore, no impairment exists. Should we reach a different conclusion in the future, additional work would be performed to ascertain the amount of the non-cash impairment charge to be recognized. We must also perform impairment testing at other times if an event or circumstance occurs indicating that it is more likely than not that an impairment has been incurred. The maximum future impairment of goodwill that we could incur is the amount recognized in our balance sheet, $665.7 million. Stock options . We recognize stock option-based compensation expense in our consolidated statement of income using a fair value based method. Fair value methods use a valuation model for shorter-term, market-traded financial instruments to theoretically value stock option grants even though they are not available for trading and are of longer duration. The Black-Scholes option-pricing model that we use includes the input of certain variables that are dependent on future expectations, including the expected lives of our options from grant date to exercise date, the volatility of our underlying common shares in the market over that time period, and the rate of dividends that we will pay during that time. Our estimates of these variables are made for the purpose of using the valuation model to determine an expense for each reporting period and are not subsequently adjusted. Unlike most of our expenses, the resulting charge to earnings using a fair value based method is a non-cash charge that is never measured by, or adjusted based on, a cash outflow. Provision for income taxes . After compensation and related costs, our provision for income taxes on our earnings is our largest annual expense. We operate in numerous states and countries through our various subsidiaries, and must allocate our income, expenses, and earnings under the various laws and regulations of each of these taxing jurisdictions. Accordingly, our provision for income taxes represents our total estimate of the liability that we have incurred in doing business each year in all of our locations. Annually, we file tax returns that represent our filing positions with each jurisdiction and settle our return liabilities. Each jurisdiction has the right to audit those returns and may take different positions with respect to income and expense allocations and taxable earnings determinations. From time to time, we may also provide for estimated liabilities associated with uncertain tax return filing positions that are subject to, or in the process of, being audited by various tax authorities. Because the determination of our annual provision is subject to judgments and estimates, it is likely that actual results will vary from those recognized in our financial statements. As a result, we recognize additions to, or reductions of, income tax expense during a reporting period that pertain to prior period provisions as our estimated liabilities are revised and actual tax returns and tax audits are settled. We recognize any such prior period adjustment in the discrete quarterly period in which it is determined. NEWLY ISSUED BUT NOT YET ADOPTED ACCOUNTING GUIDANCE. Each reporting period we consider all newly issued but not yet adopted accounting and reporting guidance that is applicable to our operations and the preparation of our consolidated statements. We do not believe that any issued guidance that we have not yet adopted will have a material effect on our financial position or results of operations. - 21 - FORWARD-LOOKING INFORMATION. From time to time, information or statements provided by or on behalf of T. Rowe Price, including those within this report, may contain certain forward-looking information, including information or anticipated information relating to: our revenues, net income and earnings per share on common stock; changes in the amount and composition of our assets under management; our expense levels; our estimated effective income tax rate; and our expectations regarding financial markets, future transactions, investments, capital expenditures, and other conditions. Readers are cautioned that any forward-looking information provided by or on behalf of T. Rowe Price is not a guarantee of future performance. Actual results may differ materially from those in forward-looking information because of various factors including, but not limited to, those discussed below and in Item 1A, Risk Factors, of this Form 10-K Annual Report. Further, forward-looking statements speak only as of the date on which they are made, and we undertake no obligation to update any forward-looking statement to reflect events or circumstances after the date on which it is made or to reflect the occurrence of unanticipated events. Our future revenues and results of operations will fluctuate primarily due to changes in the total value and composition of assets under our management. Such changes result from many factors including, among other things: cash inflows and outflows in the T. Rowe Price mutual funds and other managed investment portfolios; fluctuations in global financial markets that result in appreciation or depreciation of the assets under our management; our introduction of new mutual funds and investment portfolios; and changes in retirement savings trends relative to participant-directed investments and defined contribution plans. The ability to attract and retain investors assets under our management is dependent on investor sentiment and confidence; the relative investment performance of the Price mutual funds and other managed investment portfolios as compared to competing offerings and market indexes; the ability to maintain our investment management and administrative fees at appropriate levels; competitive conditions in the mutual fund, asset management, and broader financial services sectors; and our level of success in implementing our strategy to expand our business. Our revenues are substantially dependent on fees earned under contracts with the Price funds and could be adversely affected if the independent directors of one or more of the Price funds terminated or significantly altered the terms of the investment management or related administrative services agreements. Non-operating investment income (loss) will also fluctuate primarily due to the size of our investments, and changes in their market valuations or, in the case of our equity investments, our proportionate share of their net income. Our future results are also dependent upon the level of our expenses, which are subject to fluctuation for the following or other reasons: changes in the level of our advertising expenses in response to market conditions, including our efforts to expand our investment advisory business to investors outside the United States and to further penetrate our distribution channels within the United States; variations in the level of total compensation expense due to, among other things, bonuses, stock option grants, other incentive awards, changes in our employee count and mix, and competitive factors; any goodwill impairment that may arise; fluctuation in foreign currency exchange rates applicable to the costs of our international operations; expenses and capital costs, such as technology assets, depreciation, amortization, and research and development, incurred to maintain and enhance our administrative and operating services infrastructure; unanticipated costs that may be incurred to protect investor accounts and the goodwill of our clients; and disruptions of services, including those provided by third parties, such as facilities, communications, power, and the mutual fund transfer agent and accounting systems. Our business is also subject to substantial governmental regulation, and changes in legal, regulatory, accounting, tax, and compliance requirements may have a substantial effect on our operations and results, including but not limited to effects on costs that we incur and effects on investor interest in mutual funds and investing in general, or in particular classes of mutual funds or other investments. - 22 -
