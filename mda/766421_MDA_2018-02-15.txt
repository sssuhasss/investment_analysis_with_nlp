ITEM 7. MANAGEMENT S DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS OF FINANCIAL CONDITION AND RESULTS OF OPERATIONS OVERVIEW The following Management Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations (MD&A) is intended to help the reader understand our company, our operations and our present business environment. MD&A is provided as a supplement to and should be read in conjunction with our consolidated financial statements and the accompanying notes. All statements in the following discussion that are not statements of historical information or descriptions of current accounting policy are forward-looking statements. Please consider our forward-looking statements in light of the risks referred to in this report introductory cautionary note and the risks mentioned in Part I, Item 1A. Risk Factors. This overview summarizes the MD&A, which includes the following sections: Year in Review highlights from 2017 outlining some of the major events that happened during the year and how they affected our financial performance. Results of Operations an in-depth analysis of our revenues by segment and our expenses from a consolidated perspective for the three years presented in our consolidated financial statements. To the extent material to the understanding of segment profitability, we more fully describe the segment expenses per financial statement line item. Financial and statistical data is also included here. As Virgin America was acquired on December 14, 2016, its financial and operational results are reflected in the year ended December 31, 2017, but not in the comparative prior period. However, for comparability purposes, we have added "Combined Comparative" information for the prior year, which is more fully described below. This section includes forward-looking statements regarding our view of 2018 . Further information about the acquisition of Virgin America can be found in Note 2 to the consolidated financial statements. Liquidity and Capital Resources an overview of our financial position, analysis of cash flows, sources and uses of cash, contractual obligations and commitments and off-balance sheet arrangements. Critical Accounting Estimates a discussion of our accounting estimates that involve significant judgment and uncertainties. YEAR IN REVIEW In 2017 , we expanded our network at a record pace, adding 44 new markets across the network during the year. Additionally, we devoted a significant amount of energy and resources to integrating Alaska and Virgin America. We achieved many integration milestones, including merging many back-office functions, co-locating many stations, and launching technology for front-line employees to enable them to serve our customers seamlessly between carriers. In 2017 , we posted our 14th consecutive annual profit on an adjusted basis. Our pretax income was $1.2 billion , compared to $1.3 billion in 2016. Our 2017 pretax income on an adjusted basis (a non-GAAP financial measure) was $1.3 billion , a decrease of 9% from 2016 . Adjusted pretax income for 2017 excludes $118 million of merger-related costs associated with our acquisition of Virgin America and $7 million of mark-to-market fuel hedge benefit. The decrease in adjusted pretax income was driven largely by an increase in operating expenses, excluding fuel and special items, of $1.5 billion , and an increase in fuel expense of $616 million . The increase in operating expense was primarily due to the full-year impact of Virgin America in our financial results. The increased costs were partially offset by an increase in operating revenues of $2.0 billion . The growth in revenues of $2.0 billion was driven by the growth in our business, attributable to the inclusion of Virgin America in our results for the full year, as well as our expansion into 44 new markets entered into during the year. On the regional side of our business, Horizon began flying the new Embraer E175 regional jets in 2017 the first 10 of 33 aircraft scheduled for delivery over a three year period. We believe we have a strong future ahead of us and look forward to the many new opportunities our combined networks will bring our company. See Results of Operations below for further discussion of changes in revenues and operating expenses and our reconciliation of Non-GAAP measures to the most directly comparable GAAP measure. 33 Accomplishments and Highlights Recognition and Awards - Alaska Ranked "Highest in Customer Satisfaction Among Traditional Carriers" in 2017 by J.D.

Donated over $14 million and contributed more than 32,000 volunteer hours to support nonprofits in our local communities, focusing on youth and education, medical (research/transportation) and community outreach. Shareholder Return In 2017 , we paid cash dividends of $148 million and repurchased approximately 981 thousand shares of our common stock for $75 million under the $1 billion share repurchase program authorized by our Board of Directors in August 2015 . As of December 31, 2017 , the Company has repurchased approximately 5 million shares for $388 million under this program. 34 Since 2007, we have repurchased 60 million shares of common stock for $1.6 billion for an average price of approximately $26.72 per share. In 2017 , we increased our quarterly dividend 9% from $0.275 per share to $0.300 per share, and, subsequent to December 31, 2017 , we announced a 7% increase to $0.32 per share for 2018. Overall, we returned $223 million to shareholders during 2017 . We expect to continue to return capital to shareholders in 2018 , primarily in the form of dividends. Outlook In 2018 and beyond, we are focused on successfully completing the integration of Virgin America with Alaska. In January 2018 Alaska and Virgin America received a Single Operating Certificate (SOC), our most significant integration milestone to date. The integration milestones achieved thus far will help to ease our transition to a single Passenger Service System (PSS) on April 25, 2018. This will allow us to provide one reservation system, one website and one inventory of flights to our guests, which will help unlock many of the revenue synergies expected from the acquisition. In conjunction with PSS, at all gates, ticketing and check-in areas, guests will be greeted with Alaska branding. We will continue to make investments to enhance our onboard guest experience. Some of the more notable projects underway include adding satellite connectivity to our entire Boeing and Airbus fleets to offer high-speed satellite Wi-Fi, further upgrades to our onboard menu offerings, updating and expanding airport lounges in the JFK and Seattle airports, and investment in our Seattle hub airport to open a state-of-the-art 20-gate North Terminal facility. In 2018, we expect to continue to experience cost pressure, due in large part to pilot wage increases, which became effective in the fourth quarter of 2017, and a new maintenance cost-per-hour agreement that will result in higher maintenance costs in 2018, but will help to reduce the volatility of maintenance expense over the next several years. We also expect to continue to incur further costs associated with the ongoing integration of Virgin America. For the first quarter of 2018, we expect unit revenues (RASM) to decline 3.5% - 4.5% and unit costs, excluding fuel and special items (CASM, ex fuel) to increase approximately 6% . In addition, we expect the price per gallon of jet fuel to increase approximately 21% from the prior-year period. Based on these current estimates, we are likely to report a loss in the first quarter although we expect our unit costs and unit revenues to improve throughout 2018. Our priority throughout the integration process is to run two great airlines and to maintain safe and compliant operations, while providing a great experience for our guests. We are particularly focused on merging the Alaska and Virgin America cultures and brands that our guests respect and trust. We intend to minimize any disruption to our guests during our integration efforts by being transparent about our progress and how the changes may affect them. Employee engagement throughout the integration will remain a top priority as well, ensuring that employees remain engaged, informed and excited about the new Company's future. Additionally, we will remain focused on capturing the value and synergies created by combining these two great airlines. We expect to grow our combined network capacity in 2018 by approximately 7.5% , compared to a 7.1% combined growth in 2017 . Current schedules indicate competitive capacity will be roughly 6 points higher in the first quarter of 2018 . We believe that our product, our operation, our engaged employees, our award-winning service, and our competitive Mileage Plan , combined with our strong balance sheet, give us the ability to compete vigorously in our markets. 35 RESULTS OF OPERATIONS ADJUSTED (NON-GAAP) RESULTS AND PER-SHARE AMOUNTS We believe disclosure of earnings excluding the impact of merger-related costs, mark-to-market gains or losses or other individual special revenues or expenses is useful information to investors because: By excluding fuel expense and certain special items (including merger-related costs) from our unit metrics, we believe that we have better visibility into the results of operations and our non-fuel cost initiatives. Our industry is highly competitive and is characterized by high fixed costs, so even a small reduction in non-fuel operating costs can lead to a significant improvement in operating results. In addition, we believe that all domestic carriers are similarly impacted by changes in jet fuel costs over the long run, so it is important for management (and investors) to understand the impact of (and trends in) company-specific cost drivers, such as labor rates and productivity, airport costs, maintenance costs, etc., which are more controllable by management. Cost per ASM (CASM) excluding fuel and certain special items, such as merger-related costs, is one of the most important measures used by management and by the Air Group Board of Directors in assessing quarterly and annual cost performance. Adjusted income before income tax and CASM excluding fuel (and other items as specified in our plan documents) are important metrics for the employee incentive plan, which covers the majority of Air Group employees. CASM excluding fuel and certain special items is a measure commonly used by industry analysts and we believe it is an important metric by which they compare our airlines to others in the industry. The measure is also the subject of frequent questions from investors. Disclosure of the individual impact of certain noted items provides investors the ability to measure and monitor performance both with and without these special items. We believe that disclosing the impact of certain items, such as merger-related costs and mark-to-market hedging adjustments, is important because it provides information on significant items that are not necessarily indicative of future performance. Industry analysts and investors consistently measure our performance without these items for better comparability between periods and among other airlines. Although we disclose our passenger unit revenues, we do not (nor are we able to) evaluate unit revenues excluding the impact that changes in fuel costs have had on ticket prices. Fuel expense represents a large percentage of our total operating expenses. Fluctuations in fuel prices often drive changes in unit revenues in the mid-to-long term. Although we believe it is useful to evaluate non-fuel unit costs for the reasons noted above, we would caution readers of these financial statements not to place undue reliance on unit costs excluding fuel as a measure or predictor of future profitability because of the significant impact of fuel costs on our business. Although we are presenting these non-GAAP amounts for the reasons above, investors and other readers should not necessarily conclude that these amounts are non-recurring, infrequent, or unusual in nature. 2017 COMPARED WITH 2016 Our consolidated net income for 2017 was $1 billion , or $8.35 per diluted share, compared to net income of $814 million , or $6.54 per diluted share, in 2016 . As the acquisition of Virgin America closed on December 14, 2016, our 2016 financial results include Virgin America for the period of December 14, 2016 through December 31, 2016 and the impact of purchase accounting as of December 14, 2016. Refer to the "Critical Accounting Estimates" section for further information regarding purchase accounting. Excluding the impact of merger-related costs, mark-to-market fuel hedge adjustments and a special tax benefit as a result of tax reform, our adjusted consolidated net income for 2017 was $823 million , or $6.64 per diluted share, compared to an adjusted consolidated net income of $911 million , or $7.32 per share, in 2016 . The following table reconciles our adjusted net income and earnings per diluted share (EPS) during the full year 2017 and 2016 to amounts as reported in accordance with GAAP. 36 Twelve Months Ended December 31, 2017 2016 (in millions, except per-share amounts) Dollars Diluted EPS Dollars Diluted EPS Reported GAAP net income and diluted EPS $ 1,034 $ 8.35 $ 814 $ 6.54 Mark-to-market fuel hedge (benefit)/expense (7 ) (0.06 ) (13 ) (0.11 ) Special items merger-related costs and other (a) 118 0.95 117 0.94 Income tax effect on special items and fuel hedge adjustments (b) (42 ) (0.34 ) (24 ) (0.19 ) Special tax (benefit)/expense (c) (280 ) (2.26 ) 17 0.14 Non-GAAP adjusted net income and diluted EPS $ 823 $ 6.64 $ 911 $ 7.32 (a) Refer to Note 10 to the consolidated financial statement for the description of special items. (b) Certain merger-related costs are non-deductible for tax purposes, resulting in a smaller income tax effect for 2016 adjusting items. (c) Special tax (benefit)/expense in 2017 is due to the remeasurement of deferred tax liabilities as a result of the Tax Cuts and Jobs Act signed into law on December 22, 2017, offset by certain state tax law enactments. In 2016 it represents discrete impacts of adjustments to our position on income sourcing in various states. CASM is summarized below: Twelve Months Ended December 31, 2017 2016 % Change Consolidated: Total CASM 10.75 10.38 3.6 % Less the following components: Aircraft fuel, including hedging gains and losses 2.33 1.88 23.9 % Special items merger-related costs and other (a) 0.19 0.27 (29.6 )% CASM, excluding fuel and special items 8.23 8.23 % Mainline: Total CASM 9.92 9.39 5.6 % Less the following components: Aircraft fuel, including hedging gains and losses 2.24 1.79 25.1 % Special items merger-related costs and other (a) 0.21 0.30 (30.0 )% CASM, excluding fuel and special items 7.47 7.30 2.3 % (a) Refer to Note 10 to the consolidated financial statement for the description of special items. Impact of Accounting Changes The following discussion of 2017 compared with 2016 results reflects balances as reported within this 10-K. On January 1, 2018 we will implement ASU 2014-09, "Revenue from Contracts with Customers," and ASU 2017-07, "Compensation- Retirement Benefits." We have elected to apply both standards using the full retrospective approach, which will require us to restate prior period financial information under the new standards. When providing forward looking guidance on line items that will be recast under the new standards, we have included provisional recast amounts herein. Under the new revenue recognition standard, the primary changes to our financial information relate to Mileage Plan accounting, ticket breakage, and ancillary revenue geography. Mileage Plan miles earned through travel have historically been accounted for using the incremental cost approach. Under the new standard, we will allocate a portion of the ticket price to deferred revenue. Ticket breakage was historically recognized at time of expiration. Under the new standard, ticket breakage will be recorded based on an estimate at the original departure date. Ancillary revenues related to passenger travel, which were historically presented as Other revenue, will be reclassified to Passenger Revenue. As a result of the new revenue recognition standard, we expect to restate 2017 and 2016 financial information in our future filings. We expect 2017 reported revenues will be reduced by approximately $41 million , and reported non-fuel operating costs will increase by approximately $13 million , resulting in a net reduction of $54 million to reported adjusted pretax profit. We expect a similar impact in 2018. 37 Although less significant, the new retirement benefits accounting standard is also effective January 1, 2018. Under this new standard, all components of net periodic benefit cost will be presented in Nonoperating income (expense), except service cost, which will remain in Wages and benefits. This change has an impact on CASM. Management believes it is useful to compare forecasted results with the restated results under the new standards, as noted in the impacted areas below. The implementation of the new standards will impact common industry metrics such as PRASM, RASM, and CASM excluding fuel and special items. We will provide restated metrics in a separate filing. 38 OPERATING STATISTICS SUMMARY (unaudited) Alaska Air Group, Inc. Below are operating statistics we use to measure performance. As the acquisition of Virgin America closed on December 14, 2016, Consolidated and Mainline amounts presented below include Virgin America results for the twelve months ended December 31, 2017 , but only for the period December 14, 2016 through December 31, 2016 in the twelve months ended December 31, 2016 results below. We often refer to unit revenues and adjusted unit costs, which is a non-GAAP measure.

The discussion below includes "Combined Comparative" results for 2016 , determined as the sum of the historical consolidated results of Air Group and Virgin America. Virgin America's financial information has been conformed to reflect Air Group's historical financial statement presentation. This information does not purport to reflect what our financial and operational results would have been had the acquisition been consummated at the beginning of the periods presented.

OPERATING REVENUES Total operating revenues increased $2.0 billion , or 34% , during 2017 compared to the same period in 2016 . On a Combined Comparative basis, total operating revenues increased $438 million or 6% . The changes, including the reconciliation of the impact of Virgin America on the comparative results, are summarized in the following table: Twelve Months Ended December 31, Change (in millions) 2017 2016 as Reported 2016 Pre-Acquisition Virgin America 2016 Combined $ Combined % Combined Passenger Mainline $ 5,858 $ 4,098 $ 1,414 $ 5,512 $ 346 6.3 % Regional 960 908 908 52 5.7 % Total passenger revenue $ 6,818 $ 5,006 $ 1,414 $ 6,420 $ 398 6.2 % Freight and mail 114 108 108 6 5.6 % Other net 1,001 817 150 967 34 3.5 % Total operating revenues $ 7,933 $ 5,931 $ 1,564 $ 7,495 $ 438 5.8 % Passenger Revenue Mainline On a consolidated basis, Mainline passenger revenue for 2017 increased by $1.8 billion , or 43% on a 44% increase in capacity driven by the acquisition of Virgin America, partially offset by a 1% decrease in unit revenues compared to 2016 . On a Combined Comparative basis, Mainline passenger revenue increased by $346 million or 6% , due to a 7% increase in capacity, partially offset by a 1% decrease in unit revenue compared to the combined Mainline results for 2016. The increase in capacity was driven by our continued network expansion and aircraft added to our fleet in the current year. The decrease in PRASM was 40 driven by a decrease in ticket yields on relatively flat load factors. Lower ticket yields (pricing) were impacted, in large part, by our new market growth and by competitor pricing actions felt more acutely in our California markets. Passenger Revenue Regional Regional passenger revenue increased by $52 million , or 6% , compared to 2016 due to a 10% increase in capacity, partially offset by a 4% decrease in PRASM compared to 2016 . The increase in capacity is due to an increase in departures from new E175 deliveries, an increase in average aircraft stage length and the annualization of new routes introduced over the past twelve months. The decrease in Regional PRASM was primarily driven by the significant growth in our regional business and competitive pricing actions. Other Net Other net revenue increased $184 million , or 23% , from 2016 , primarily due to increases in frequent flyer program revenue. Frequent flyer program revenue increased $53 million or 12% , due to an increase in miles sold to our affinity card partner in the the current year. On a Combined Comparative basis, Other net revenue increased $34 million , or 4% . Under the new revenue recognition standard, our 2017 recast revenues will decrease by approximately $41 million . We expect competitive pressures on unit revenues to continue into 2018. However, given our projected capacity growth, we expect total revenue will increase in 2018 as we expect to grow our capacity approximately 7.5% . OPERATING EXPENSES Total operating expenses increased $2.1 billion , or 46% , compared to 2016 . On a Combined Comparative basis, total operating expenses increased $749 million , or 13% primarily as a result of higher wages and benefits and higher fuel costs, among other increases. We believe it is useful to summarize operating expenses as follows, which is consistent with the way expenses are reported internally and evaluated by management: Twelve Months Ended December 31, Change (in millions) 2017 2016 as Reported 2016 Pre-acquisition Virgin America 2016 Combined $ Combined % Combined Fuel expense $ 1,447 $ 831 $ 293 $ 1,124 $ 323 28.7 % Non-fuel expenses 5,108 3,634 1,028 4,662 446 9.6 % Special items merger-related costs 118 117 21 138 (20 ) (14.5 )% Total Operating Expenses $ 6,673 $ 4,582 $ 1,342 $ 5,924 $ 749 12.6 % Significant operating expense variances from 2016 are more fully described below. Aircraft Fuel Aircraft fuel expense includes both raw fuel expense (as defined below) and the effect of mark-to-market adjustments to our fuel hedge portfolio included in our consolidated statement of operations as the value of that portfolio increases and decreases. Aircraft fuel expense can be volatile, even between quarters, because it includes these gains or losses in the value of the underlying instrument as crude oil prices and refining margins increase or decrease. Raw fuel expense is defined as the price that we generally pay at the airport, or the into-plane price, including taxes and fees. Raw fuel prices are impacted by world oil prices and refining costs, which can vary by region in the U.S. Raw fuel expense approximates cash paid to suppliers and does not reflect the effect of our fuel hedges. 41 Aircraft fuel expense increased $616 million , or 74% compared to 2016 . On a Combined Comparative basis, aircraft fuel expense increased $323 million , or 29% . The elements of the change are illustrated in the following table: Twelve Months Ended December 31, 2017 2016 as Reported 2016 Combined (in millions, except for per gallon amounts) Dollars Cost/Gal Dollars Cost/Gal Dollars Cost/Gal Raw or "into-plane" fuel cost $ 1,437 $ 1.80 $ 828 $ 1.49 $ 1,105 $ 1.49 Losses on settled hedges 17 0.02 16 0.03 34 0.05 Consolidated economic fuel expense $ 1,454 $ 1.82 $ 844 $ 1.52 $ 1,139 $ 1.54 Mark-to-market fuel hedge adjustments (7 ) (13 ) (0.02 ) (15 ) (0.02 ) GAAP fuel expense $ 1,447 $ 1.82 $ 831 $ 1.50 $ 1,124 $ 1.52 Fuel gallons 797 554 739 On a Combined Comparative basis, raw fuel expense per gallon increased 21% due primarily to higher West Coast jet fuel prices. West Coast jet fuel prices are impacted by both the price of crude oil, as well as the refining margins associated with the conversion of crude oil to jet fuel. The increase in raw fuel price per gallon during 2017 was driven by a 38% increase in refining margins and a 17% increase in crude oil prices, compared to the prior year. Fuel gallons consumed increased by 58 million , or 8% , consistent with the increase in capacity of 7% on a Combined Comparative basis. We also evaluate economic fuel expense, which we define as raw fuel expense adjusted for the cash we receive from hedge counterparties for hedges that settle during the period, and for the premium expense that we paid for those contracts. A key difference between aircraft fuel expense and economic fuel expense is the timing of gain or loss recognition on our hedge portfolio. When we refer to economic fuel expense, we include gains and losses only when they are realized for those contracts that were settled during the period based on their original contract terms. We believe this is the best measure of the effect that fuel prices have on our business because it most closely approximates the net cash outflow associated with purchasing fuel for our operations. Accordingly, many industry analysts evaluate our results using this measure, and it is the basis for most internal management reporting and incentive pay plans. Losses recognized for hedges that settled during the year were $17 million in 2017 , compared to losses of $16 million in 2016 . These amounts represent cash paid for premium expense, offset by any cash received from those hedges at settlement. As of the date of this filing we expect our economic fuel price per gallon to increase approximately 21% in the first quarter of 2018 as compared to the first quarter of 2017 due to higher crude oil prices and refining margins. As both oil prices and refining margins are volatile, we are unable to forecast the full-year cost with any certainty. 42 Non-fuel Expense and Non-special items The table below provides the reconciliation of the impact of Virgin America on the comparative results for each of our operating expense line items, excluding fuel and special items. Twelve Months Ended December 31, Change (in millions) 2017 2016 as Reported 2016 Pre-acquisition Virgin America 2016 Combined $ Combined % Combined Wages and benefits $ 1,924 $ 1,382 284 1,666 258 15.5 % Variable incentive pay 135 127 32 159 (24 ) (15.1 )% Aircraft maintenance 391 270 80 350 41 11.7 % Aircraft rent 274 114 170 284 (10 ) (3.5 )% Landing fees and other rentals 460 320 107 427 33 7.7 % Contracted services 314 247 60 307 7 2.3 % Selling expenses 357 225 123 348 9 2.6 % Depreciation and amortization 372 363 37 400 (28 ) (7.0 )% Food and beverage service 195 126 49 175 20 11.4 % Third-party regional carrier expense 121 95 95 26 27.4 % Other 565 365 86 451 114 25.3 % Total non-fuel, non-special operating expenses $ 5,108 $ 3,634 $ 1,028 $ 4,662 $ 446 9.6 % Wages and Benefits Wages and benefits increased during 2017 by $542 million , or 39% , compared to 2016 . On a Combined Comparative basis, total wages and benefits increased by $258 million or 15% . The primary components of wages and benefits, including a reconciliation of 2016 on a Combined Comparative basis, are shown in the following table: Twelve Months Ended December 31, Change (in millions) 2017 2016 as Reported 2016 Pre-acquisition Virgin America 2016 Combined $ Combined % Combined Wages $ 1,468 $ 1,022 $ 224 $ 1,246 $ 222 17.8 % Medical and other benefits 216 192 23 215 1 0.5 % Defined contribution plans 103 67 22 89 14 15.7 % Pension Defined benefit plans 32 25 25 7 28.0 % Payroll taxes 105 76 15 91 14 15.4 % Total wages and benefits $ 1,924 $ 1,382 $ 284 $ 1,666 $ 258 15.5 % On a Combined Comparative basis, wages increased $222 million with a 16% increase in FTEs. The increase in FTEs is attributable to the growth in our business and the growth in McGee Air Services, which has brought certain airport ground service positions in-house that were previously reflected in Contracted Services expense. Additionally, wage rates for pilots at Alaska and Virgin America increased significantly in November 2017 as a result of new contract rates stemming from a decision reached by a third-party arbitration panel during the fourth quarter of 2017 . Costs associated with our defined contribution plans increased $14 million , or 16% , on a Combined Comparative basis, due to FTE growth and increased participation throughout all labor groups. Additionally, due to the arbitration decision reached in the fourth quarter of 2017, pilots at Alaska and Virgin America began receiving contributions at a higher rate. 43 Pension expense increased 28% compared to the same period in the prior year. The increase is due to the change in certain assumptions used at December 31, 2016, particularly discount rates which were lowered by 60 to 72 basis points, resulting in higher expense recognition in 2017. Under the new retirement benefits accounting standard, 2017 recast wages and benefits will increase approximately $7 million . On a recast basis, we expect wages and benefits to grow at a greater rate than projected capacity growth in 2018 . Alaska and Virgin America pilot wage increases are the primary drivers of this increase. The remainder is due to the expected growth in FTEs to support our capacity growth, along with higher wage rates, medical costs and higher pension costs. Furthermore, we may reach a new agreement with our mainline flight attendants, which would also result in higher wages. Variable Incentive Pay Variable incentive pay expense increased to $135 million in 2017 from $127 million in 2016 . On a Combined Comparative basis, variable incentive pay decreased $24 million , or 15% , due to lower achievement against performance-based pay metrics as compared to the prior year. Aircraft Maintenance Aircraft maintenance costs increased by $121 million , or 45% , compared to 2016 . On a Combined Comparative basis, aircraft maintenance costs increased $41 million , or 12% . Maintenance costs increased primarily due to timing of scheduled maintenance events in 2017, as well as a power-by-the-hour maintenance agreement that began during the fourth quarter of 2017. We expect aircraft maintenance expense to increase, consistent with capacity growth in 2018 . We will have an increase in engine maintenance costs primarily due to the full year impact of the power-by-the-hour engine maintenance arrangement on our B737-800 aircraft as noted above, as well as general maintenance expenditures increases as we continue to add capacity to our network. Aircraft Rent Aircraft rent expense increased $160 million , or 140% , compared to 2016 . On a Combined Comparative basis, aircraft rent expense decreased $10 million , or 4% , primarily due to the resetting of straight-line aircraft rent resulting from purchase price accounting for leases held by Virgin America, partially offset by the addition of four A321neos added to our mainline fleet and eight E175s added to our regional fleet. We expect aircraft rent to increase in 2018 at a greater rate than our forecasted capacity growth due to additional leased A321neo and E175 aircraft scheduled for delivery in 2018 . Landing Fees and Other Rentals Landing fees and other rental expenses increased $140 million , or 44% , compared to 2016 . On a Combined Comparative basis, landing fees and other rental expenses increased $33 million , or 8% , primarily due to increased flying in 2017 , as we increased capacity by 7% on a combined basis, and entered into 44 new markets. We expect landing fees and other rental expense to grow at a slightly greater rate than capacity in 2018 as we continue to add capacity in our network and enter new markets. Additionally, we expect continued rate increases at airports across our network. Contracted Services Contracted services increased $67 million , or 27% , when compared to 2016 . On a Combined Comparative basis, contracted services increased $7 million , or 2% , primarily due to increased flying at stations where we use vendors to assist us. Additionally, wage rates for our vendor employees have increased due to higher minimum wage laws in many locations we serve. These cost increases were partially offset by insourcing some of the ground services at many airports to McGee Air Services, whose costs are now included in other financial statement line items, particularly wages and benefits. We expect contracted services to increase in 2018 , consistent with our projected capacity growth. The increases are primarily due to higher wage rates in locations where we use vendor employees, and ongoing information technology and facilities projects that we use outside contractors to assist with. 44 Selling Expenses Selling expenses increased by $132 million , or 59% , compared to 2016 . On a Combined Comparative basis, selling expenses increased $9 million , or 3% , mostly due to increased promotional and advertising activities, as well as new sponsorships which became effective in the current year. Under the new revenue recognition standard, our 2017 recast selling expense will increase by approximately $13 million . We expect selling expense to decrease in 2018 on a recast basis, due primarily to a decrease in advertising spend forecasted as well as decreased Mileage Plan partner airline expense due to the termination of certain partnerships with other airlines. Depreciation and Amortization Depreciation and amortization expenses increased by $9 million , or 2% , compared to 2016 . On a Combined Comparative basis, depreciation and amortization expense decreased $28 million , or 7% , primarily due to a change in the estimated useful lives of certain B737 operating aircraft and related parts from 20 years to 25 years, which was effective October 1, 2016, partially offset by the addition of 14 B737-900ERs and 10 E175s to our fleet since December 31, 2016 . We expect depreciation and amortization expense to increase in line with capacity growth in 2018 compared to 2017 , primarily due to scheduled B737-900ER and E175 aircraft deliveries in 2018 . Food and Beverage Service Food and beverage service expense increased by $69 million , or 55% , compared to 2016 . On a Combined Comparative basis, food and beverage service expenses increased $20 million , or 11% , due to the increased number of passengers, premium class offerings and enhancements to our onboard menu offerings to provide higher quality food and beverage products. We expect food and beverage expenses to increase in line with capacity growth in 2018 compared to 2017 , primarily due to an expected increase in number of passengers as we continue to grow our network and higher product costs. Third-party regional carrier expense Third-party regional carrier expense, which represents payments made to SkyWest and PenAir under our CPA agreements, increased $26 million , or 27% , in 2017 compared to 2016 . The increase is primarily due to the addition of eight E175 aircraft operated by SkyWest in the current year. We expect third-party regional carrier expense to increase in 2018 as we add E175 aircraft to be operated by SkyWest and continue to expand our regional network. Other Operating Expenses Other operating expenses increased $200 million , or 55% , compared to 2016 . On a Combined Comparative basis, other operating expenses increased $114 million , or 25% , primarily due to higher costs associated with crew costs such as hotels and per diems, training, higher IT costs, an increase in scrapped parts inventory, and higher property taxes. We expect other operating expenses to increase consistent with capacity growth in 2018 driven primarily by increased personnel costs such as meals and hotels. Special Items Merger-Related Costs and Other We recorded special items of $118 million for merger-related costs associated with our acquisition of Virgin America in 2017 , compared to $117 million in 2016 , which reflects the results of Virgin America from December 14, 2016 through December 31, 2016, and $138 million on a Combined Comparative basis in 2016 . Costs incurred in 2017 consisted primarily of severance and retention costs, and IT integration costs. We expect to continue to incur merger-related costs through 2019. Consolidated Nonoperating Income (Expense) During 2017 we recorded nonoperating expense of $53 million , compared to nonoperating expense of $4 million in 2016 . On a Combined Comparative basis, nonoperating expense increased by $30 million , primarily due to interest expense incurred in the current year on the debt issued in 2016 to finance the acquisition of Virgin America. 45 ADDITIONAL SEGMENT INFORMATION Refer to Note 12 of the consolidated financial statements for a detailed description of each segment. Below is a summary of each segment's profitability. Mainline Mainline adjusted pretax profit was $1.3 billion in 2017 compared to $1.3 billion in 2016 . On a Combined Comparative basis, Mainline adjusted pretax profit decreased by $253 million . The table below provides the reconciliation of the impact of Virgin America on the comparative results for our Mainline segment, excluding merger-related costs and mark-to-market fuel-hedge accounting charges: Twelve Months Ended December 31, Change (in millions) 2017 2016 as Reported 2016 Pre-acquisition Virgin America 2016 Combined $ Combined Mainline Operating revenues $ 6,890 $ 4,940 $ 1,564 $ 6,504 $ 386 Non-fuel, non-special operating expenses 4,257 2,883 1,028 3,911 346 Economic fuel 1,282 719 293 1,012 270 Operating income 1,351 1,338 243 1,581 (230 ) Nonoperating income (expense) (39 ) 3 (19 ) (16 ) (23 ) Pretax profit $ 1,312 $ 1,341 $ 224 $ 1,565 $ (253 ) The $253 million decrease in Combined Comparative pretax profit was driven by a $270 million increase in Mainline fuel expense, a $346 million increase in Mainline non-fuel operating expenses, and a $23 million increase in nonoperating expense. These increases were partially offset by a $386 million increase in Mainline passenger revenue. Higher raw fuel prices and an increase in gallons consumed to support additional flying, drove the increase in Mainline fuel expense. Non-fuel operating expenses increased due to higher wages to support our growth, and higher operating expenses as described above. Nonoperating expense increased primarily due to increased interest expense. Mainline revenue increased due to higher capacity from new routes added over the past twelve months. Regional Our Regional operations contributed a pretax profit of $15 million in 2017 compared to $93 million in 2016 . The $78 million decrease in pretax profit was attributable to $82 million higher non-fuel operating expense due in large part to increased capacity, and higher raw fuel costs, partially offset by a $51 million increase in operating revenues as described in Passenger Revenue Regional. Horizon Horizon incurred a pretax loss of $8 million in 2017 compared to pretax profit of $14 million in 2016 . The change was primarily driven by $20 million higher non-fuel expenses. Non-fuel expenses increased primarily due to higher wage and training expense as a result of the increase in FTE s, increased costs associated with flight cancellations, and a $9 million ratification bonus expense in connection with the agreement reached with Horizon's pilots. 46 2016 COMPARED WITH 2015 Our consolidated net income for 2016 was $814 million , or $6.54 per diluted share, compared to net income of $848 million , or $6.56 per diluted share, in 2015 . Our financial results include results of Virgin America for the period from December 14, 2016 through December 31, 2016 and the impact of purchase accounting as of December 14, 2016. Refer to the "Critical Accounting Estimates" section for further information regarding purchase accounting. Excluding the impact of mark-to-market fuel hedge adjustments and special items, our adjusted consolidated net income for 2016 was $911 million , or $7.32 per diluted share, compared to an adjusted consolidated net income of $842 million , or $6.51 per share, in 2015 . The following tables reconcile our adjusted net income and earnings per diluted share (EPS) during the full year 2016 and 2015 to amounts as reported in accordance with GAAP.

The changes are summarized in the following table: Twelve Months Ended December 31, (in millions) 2016 2015 % Change Passenger Mainline $ 4,098 $ 3,939 4.0 % Regional 908 854 6.3 % Total passenger revenue $ 5,006 $ 4,793 4.4 % Freight and mail 108 108 % Other net 817 697 17.2 % Total operating revenues $ 5,931 $ 5,598 5.9 % Passenger Revenue Mainline Mainline passenger revenue for 2016 increased by 4% due to a 10% increase in capacity, partially offset by a 5% decrease in PRASM compared to 2015 . The increase in capacity was driven by new routes and growth in our operating fleet. Virgin America capacity from the acquisition date through December 31, 2016 represented approximately 2 points of capacity increase from 2015. The decrease in PRASM was driven by a 6% decrease in ticket yield due to competitive pressures and our own growth, offset by a slight increase in load factor. Furthermore, the decline in fuel prices during 2016 contributed to lower ticket prices. Passenger Revenue Regional Regional passenger revenue increased by $54 million , or 6% , compared to 2015 due to a 17% increase in capacity, partially offset by a 9% decrease in PRASM compared to 2015 . The increase in capacity was due to an increase in departures from new E175 deliveries, an increase in average aircraft stage length and the annualization of new routes introduced over the past twelve months. The decrease in PRASM was due to a 7% decrease in ticket yield, as well as a decrease in load factor of 1.1 point s. The decrease in yield was due to an increase in competitive capacity in our regional markets and our own growth, as well as an increase in the average trip length of our regional flights. Other Net Other net revenue increased $120 million , or 17% , from 2015 , primarily due to increases in Mileage Plan revenue. Mileage Plan revenue increased $100 million, or 30%, due to increased miles sold and improved compensation terms with our Mileage Plan affinity credit card partner as a result of a contract extension effective January 1, 2016. Additionally, Mileage Plan revenue earned from our partner airlines increased as compared to the prior year. OPERATING EXPENSES Total operating expenses increased $282 million , or 7% , compared to 2015 , primarily as a result of higher wages and benefits and $117 million of merger-related costs, partially offset by lower fuel costs. We believe it is useful to summarize operating expenses as follows, which is consistent with the way expenses are reported internally and evaluated by management: Twelve Months Ended December 31, (in millions) 2016 2015 % Change Fuel expense $ 831 $ 954 (12.9 )% Non-fuel expenses 3,634 3,314 9.7 % Special items 117 32 265.6 % Total Operating Expenses $ 4,582 $ 4,300 6.6 % Significant operating expense variances from 2015 are more fully described below. 48 Wages and Benefits Wages and benefits increased during 2016 by $128 million , or 10% , compared to 2015 . The primary components of wages and benefits are shown in the following table: Twelve Months Ended December 31, (in millions) 2016 2015 % Change Wages $ 1,022 $ 945 8.1 % Medical and other benefits 192 153 25.5 % Defined contribution plans 67 60 11.6 % Pension defined benefit plans 25 28 (10.7 )% Payroll taxes 76 68 11.8 % Total wages and benefits $ 1,382 $ 1,254 10.2 % Wages increased 8% on a 7% increase in FTEs. The increase in wages was primarily attributable to FTE growth to support our growth and an increase in the average wages per employee. Medical and other benefits increased 25% compared to the prior year. The increase was primarily due to an increase in the number of employees and high-cost medical claims. Defined contribution plans increased 12% due to FTE growth and increased participation throughout all labor groups. Pension expense decreased 11%, compared to the same period in the prior year. The decrease was due to a change in several assumptions used at December 31, 2015, including a higher discount rate, updated retirement age assumptions, future salary increase assumptions and others that resulted in lower expense recognition in 2016. Variable Incentive Pay Variable incentive pay expense increased to $127 million in 2016 from $120 million in 2015 . The increase was primarily due to a higher wage base. Aircraft Fuel Aircraft fuel expense decreased $123 million , or 13% , compared to 2015 . The elements of the change are summarized in the following table: Twelve Months Ended December 31, 2016 2015 (in millions, except for per gallon amounts) Dollars Cost/Gal Dollars Cost/Gal Raw or "into-plane" fuel cost $ 828 $ 1.49 $ 935 $ 1.84 Losses on settled hedges 16 0.03 19 0.04 Consolidated economic fuel expense $ 844 $ 1.52 $ 954 $ 1.88 Mark-to-mark fuel hedge adjustments (13 ) (0.02 ) GAAP fuel expense $ 831 $ 1.50 $ 954 $ 1.88 Fuel gallons 554 508 Fuel gallons consumed increased 9% in line with the 11% increase capacity, partially offset by a 1% improvement in fuel efficiency as measured by ASMs per gallon. The raw fuel price per gallon decreased 19% as a result of lower West Coast jet fuel prices. West Coast jet fuel prices are impacted by both the price of crude oil and the refining margins associated with the conversion of crude oil to jet fuel. The decrease in raw fuel price per gallon during 2016 was due to a decline in crude oil prices of 11% and a decrease in refining margins of 36%, when compared to the prior year. 49 Losses recognized for hedges that settled during the year were $16 million in 2016 , compared to losses of $19 million in 2015 . These amounts represent cash paid for premium expense, offset by any cash received from those hedges at settlement. Aircraft Maintenance Aircraft maintenance costs increased by $17 million , or 7% , compared to 2015 . Maintenance costs increased primarily due to more engine and airframe maintenance events than in 2015. Additionally, in 2015 we received vendor credits, which offset expense, for engine maintenance that had been previously completed on the B737 fleet. Aircraft Rent Aircraft rent expense increased by $9 million, or 9%, compared to 2015, primarily due to the addition of rent expense on the 53 Airbus aircraft leased by Virgin America for the period December 14, 2016 to December 31, 2016. Landing Fees and Other Rentals Landing fees and other rental expenses increased $24 million , or 8% , primarily due to increased flying in 2016 as we increased capacity and entered into new markets. Contracted Services Contracted services increased $33 million , or 15% , when compared to 2015 . The increase was primarily due to increased flying at stations where we use vendors to assist us. Additionally, wage rates for our vendor employees have increased due in part to higher minimum wage laws in many locations we serve. We also had several information technology and facilities projects that required contracted support. Selling Expenses Selling expenses increased by $14 million , or 7% , compared to 2015 , mostly due to increased promotional and advertising activities, as well as new sponsorships which became effective in 2016. Depreciation and Amortization Depreciation and amortization expenses increased by $43 million , or 13% , compared to 2015 . The increase was primarily due to the addition of 19 B737-900ERs to our fleet since December 31, 2015, partially offset by a change in the estimated useful lives of certain B737 operating aircraft and related parts from 20 years to 25 years, which became effective October 1, 2016. Food and Beverage Service Food and beverage service expenses increased by $13 million , or 12% , due to the increased number of passengers and upgrades to our onboard menu, offering higher quality food and beverage products. Third-Party Regional Carrier Expense Third-party regional carrier expense, which represents payments made to SkyWest and PenAir under our CPAs, increased $23 million , or 32% , in 2016 compared to 2015 . The increase was primarily due to the significant increase in regional capacity in 2016 through the introduction of E175 flying. Other Operating Expenses Other operating expenses increased $9 million , or 3% , compared to 2015 . The increase was primarily due to increases in property and other taxes, personnel costs for our flight crews and an increase in fines and penalties. Special Items Merger-Related Costs and Other We recorded special items of $117 million for merger-related costs associated with our acquisition of Virgin America. These costs consisted primarily of legal expenses, investment banking fees and severance costs. Our 2015 special items of $32 million consisted of a non-cash pension settlement expense and costs related to ongoing litigation. 50 Consolidated Nonoperating Income (Expense) During 2016 , we recorded nonoperating expense of $4 million , compared to nonoperating income of $14 million in 2015 . In 2016 , we incurred more interest expense associated with the financing obtained to fund the acquisition of Virgin America. This expense was partially offset by additional interest income earned during the period we held those funds in advance of the acquisition close date. ADDITIONAL SEGMENT INFORMATION Refer to Note 12 of the consolidated financial statements for a detailed description of each segment. Below is a summary of each segments' profitability. Mainline Pretax profit for Mainline was $1.3 billion in 2016 compared to $1.2 billion in 2015 . This segment includes financial results of Virgin America from the date of acquisition through December 31, 2016. The $135 million increase was due to an increase in operating revenues of $277 million , offset by an increase in operating expenses of $126 million . Revenue growth was primarily driven by the $159 million increase in passenger revenues and the $100 million increase in Mileage Plan revenue, both described previously. Growth in operating expenses was due to higher wages to support our network growth, higher ramp and passenger handling due to increased flying and higher wage rates at stations where we use vendors to assist us, higher depreciation related to our fleet growth, and selling expenses related to increased advertising. Economic fuel cost, as defined above, decreased due to lower raw fuel costs and increased fuel efficiency, slightly offset by an 8% increase in consumption. Regional Pretax profit for Regional was $93 million in 2016 compared to $105 million in 2015 . The $12 million decrease in pretax profit was driven by a $74 million increase in non-fuel operating expenses in 2016 to support additional departures, partially offset by a $56 million increase in revenue and a $6 million decrease in fuel expense when compared to the prior year period. Horizon Pretax profit for Horizon was $14 million in 2016 compared to $28 million in 2015 . CPA Revenues (100% of which are from Alaska and eliminated in consolidation) increased due to additional capacity added in 2016. The $32 million increase in Horizon's non-fuel operating expenses was largely driven by higher medical costs due to an increased number of large medical claims, increased volume of engine overhaul and heavy airframe work, employee signing bonuses and overhead restructuring costs. LIQUIDITY AND CAPITAL RESOURCES Our primary sources of liquidity are: Our existing cash and marketable securities balance of $1.6 billion , and our expected cash from operations; Our 72 unencumbered aircraft in the operating fleet as of December 31, 2017 , that could be financed, if necessary; and Our combined bank line-of-credit facilities, with no outstanding borrowings, of $400 million . Information about these facilities can be found in Note 5 to the consolidated financial statements. In 2017 , we took delivery of 14 B737-900ER and 10 E175 aircraft and made debt payments totaling $397 million . We also continued to return capital to our shareholders by paying dividends totaling $148 million and repurchasing $75 million of our common stock. Because of our strong balance sheet and financial performance, we are one of only three airlines in the U.S. with investment grade credit ratings. We believe that our current cash and marketable securities balance combined with future cash flows from operations and other sources of liquidity will be sufficient to fund our operations and meet our debt payment obligations for the foreseeable future. 51 In our cash and marketable securities portfolio, we invest only in securities that meet our primary investment strategy of maintaining and securing investment principal. The portfolio is managed by reputable firms that adhere to our investment policy that sets forth investment objectives, approved and prohibited investments, and duration and credit quality guidelines. Our policy, and the portfolio managers, are continually reviewed to ensure that the investments are aligned with our strategy. The table below presents the major indicators of financial condition and liquidity: (in millions, except per share and debt-to-capital amounts) December 31, 2017 December 31, 2016 Change Cash and marketable securities $1,621 $1,580 $41 Cash, marketable securities and unused lines of credit as a percentage of trailing twelve months revenue 25% 31% (6) pts Long-term debt, net of current portion 2,262 2,645 (383) Shareholders equity 3,721 2,931 790 Long-term debt-to-capital including net present value of aircraft operating lease payments (a) 51% 59% (8) pts (a) Calculated using the present value of remaining aircraft lease payments for aircraft that are in our operating fleet as of the balance sheet date. The following discussion summarizes the primary drivers of the increase in our cash and marketable securities balance and our expectation of future cash requirements. ANALYSIS OF OUR CASH FLOWS Cash Provided by Operating Activities Net cash provided by operating activities was $1.6 billion in 2017 compared to $1.4 billion in 2016 . The increase of $204 million is primarily due to an increase in our net income. In 2016 , we generated $1.4 billion in operating cash flows compared to $1.6 billion in 2015 . The decrease of $200 million was due to a decline in operating results primarily driven by an increase in non-fuel operating expenses including $117 million million in merger-related costs associated with the acquisition of Virgin America partially offset by higher revenues and lower fuel costs. We typically generate positive cash flows from operations, and expect to use that cash flow to buy aircraft and capital equipment, to make debt payments, and to return capital to shareholders. During 2016, we paused our share repurchase program as we prepared for the acquisition of Virgin America. We resumed our share repurchase program in the second quarter of 2017. Cash Used in Investing Activities Cash used in investing activities was $1.1 billion during 2017 , compared to $2.6 billion in 2016 . In 2016 , cash from investing activities included approximately $2 billion of cash paid for the acquisition of Virgin America, which drove a decrease in cash used for investing activities in 2017 when compared to the prior year. Our capital expenditures were $1 billion , or $348 million higher than in 2016 primarily as a result of the purchase of more aircraft in the current year. During 2017 we took delivery of 14 B737-900ERs and 10 E715 aircraft. This compares to the delivery of 19 B737-900ERs in the prior year. Our future expected capital expenditures are summarized in the Contractual Obligations and Commitments section. Cash used in investing activities was $2.6 billion during 2016 , compared to $930 million in 2015 . We used $2 billion to acquire Virgin America, representing $2.6 billion consideration paid, offset by $645 million of cash acquired. Our capital expenditures were $678 million in 2016 , $153 million lower than in 2015. 52 Cash Provided by Financing Activities Cash used in financing activities was $592 million during 2017 , compared to cash provided by financing activities of $1.5 billion in 2016 . During the year, we made debt payments of $397 million , repurchased $75 million of our common stock and paid cash dividends of $148 million . In 2016 , we secured debt proceeds of $2 billion for the acquisition of Virgin America, made debt payments of $249 million , stock repurchases of $193 million and made cash dividend payments of $136 million . In 2015 , we made debt payments of $116 million , stock repurchases of $505 million and cash dividend payments of $102 million . We plan to meet our future capital and operating commitments through our cash and investments on hand, internally generated cash from operations, along with additional debt financing if necessary. Bank Lines of Credit We have three credit facilities with availability totaling $475 million , including one $250 million credit facility, one $150 million credit facility, and one $75 million credit facility. We have secured letters of credit against the $75 million facility but have no plans to borrow using either of the two remaining facilities. CONTRACTUAL OBLIGATIONS AND COMMITMENTS Aircraft Purchase and Lease Commitments As of December 31, 2017 , we have firm orders to purchase or lease 85 aircraft. We also have cancelable purchase commitments for 30 Airbus A320neo aircraft with deliveries from 2020 through 2022 . We could incur a loss of pre-delivery payments and credits of up to $15 million as a cancellation fee. We also have options to acquire up to 37 additional B737 aircraft with deliveries from 2020 through 2024 and 30 E175 aircraft with deliveries from 2020 to 2022 . In addition to the 23 E175 aircraft currently operated by SkyWest in our regional fleet, we have firm orders to lease 12 E175 aircraft with deliveries in 2018 , and options in future periods to add regional capacity by having SkyWest operate up to eight more E175 aircraft. We expect capital expenditures to be approximately $1 billion in 2018 and approximately $750 million in 2019 and 2020 . We currently expect delivery of eight owned Mainline jet aircraft and 13 owned regional jet aircraft in 2018 . The following table summarizes our expected fleet count by year, as of February 14, 2018 : Actual Fleet Count Contractual Deliveries (a) Aircraft Dec 31, 2016 Dec 31, 2017 2018 Changes Dec 31, 2018 2019 Changes Dec 31, 2019 B737 Freighters 6 3 3 3 B737 Passenger Aircraft 149 151 8 159 13 172 Airbus Passenger Aircraft 63 67 4 71 1 72 Total Mainline Fleet 218 221 12 233 14 247 Q400 (b) 52 50 (13 ) 37 (10 ) 27 E175 (b) 15 33 25 58 10 68 Total Regional Fleet 67 83 12 95 95 Total 285 304 24 328 14 342 (a) The expected fleet counts at December 31, 2018 and 2019 are subject to change. We intend to reduce the capital investment spend driven by fleet counts above, specifically in 2018, 2019 and 2020, which may require deferral of certain aircraft deliveries. (b) Aircraft are either owned or leased by Horizon or operated under capacity purchase agreement with a third party. For future firm orders and option exercises, we may finance the aircraft through cash from operations, long-term debt, or lease arrangements. 53 Future Fuel Hedge Positions All of our future oil positions are call options, which are designed to effectively cap the cost of the crude oil component of our jet fuel purchases. With call options, we are hedged against volatile crude oil price increases; and, during a period of decline in crude oil prices, we only forfeit cash previously paid for hedge premiums. Our crude oil positions are as follows: Approximate % of Expected Fuel Requirements Weighted-Average Crude Oil Price per Barrel Average Premium Cost per Barrel First Quarter 2018 50% $62 $2 Second Quarter 2018 50% $63 $1 Third Quarter 2018 40% $62 $2 Fourth Quarter 2018 30% $62 $2 Full Year 2018 42% $62 $2 First Quarter 2019 20% $64 $1 Second Quarter 2019 10% $65 $2 Full Year 2019 7% $65 $2 Contractual Obligations The following table provides a summary of our obligations as of December 31, 2017 . For agreements with variable terms, amounts included reflect our minimum obligations. (in millions) 2018 2019 2020 2021 2022 Beyond Total Current and long-term debt obligations $ 310 $ 393 $ 449 $ 414 $ 247 $ 768 $ 2,581 Operating lease commitments (a) 431 423 391 338 296 1,163 3,042 Aircraft maintenance deposits (b) 61 65 68 64 52 39 349 Aircraft purchase commitments (c) 955 816 377 268 193 145 2,754 Interest obligations (d) 89 81 64 47 35 69 385 Aircraft maintenance and parts management 98 102 105 121 76 80 582 Other obligations 136 158 166 172 180 1,099 1,911 Total $ 2,080 $ 2,038 $ 1,620 $ 1,424 $ 1,079 $ 3,363 $ 11,604 (a) Operating lease commitments generally include aircraft operating leases, airport property and hangar leases, office space, and other equipment leases. Included here are E175 aircraft operated by SkyWest under a capacity purchase agreement. (b) Aircraft maintenance deposits relate to leased Airbus aircraft, and the power-by-the-hour agreement for the B737-800 fleet. (c) Represents non-cancelable contractual payment commitments for aircraft and engines. We intend to reduce the capital investment from these levels, specifically in 2018, 2019 and 2020, which may require deferral of certain aircraft deliveries. (d) For variable-rate debt, future obligations are shown above using interest rates forecast as of December 31, 2017 . Defined Benefit Pensions The table above excludes contributions to our various pension plans, for which there are no minimum required contributions given the funded status of the plans. The unfunded liability for our qualified defined-benefit pension plans was $304 million at December 31, 2017 , compared to a $197 million unfunded position at December 31, 2016 . This results in an 87% funded status on a projected benefit obligation basis compared to 90% funded as of December 31, 2016 . We contributed approximately $15 million in 2017 to the plans. Credit Card Agreements We have agreements with a number of credit card companies to process the sale of tickets and other services. Under these agreements, there are material adverse change clauses that, if triggered, could result in the credit card companies holding back a reserve from our credit card receivables. Under one such agreement, we could be required to maintain a reserve if our credit rating is downgraded to or below a rating specified by the agreement or our cash and marketable securities balance fell below $500 million. Under another such agreement, we could be required to maintain a reserve if our cash and marketable securities balance fell below $500 million. We are not currently required to maintain any reserve under these agreements, but if we were, our financial position and liquidity could be materially harmed. 54 Deferred Income Taxes For federal income tax purposes, the majority of our assets are fully depreciated over a seven-year life using an accelerated depreciation method or bonus depreciation, if available. For financial reporting purposes, the majority of our assets are depreciated over 15 to 25 years to an estimated salvage value using the straight-line basis. This difference has created a significant deferred tax liability. At some point in the future the depreciation basis will reverse, potentially resulting in an increase in income taxes paid. While it is possible that we could have material cash obligations for this deferred liability at some point in the future, we cannot estimate the timing of long-term cash flows with reasonable accuracy. Taxable income and cash taxes payable in the short-term are impacted by many items, including the amount of book income generated (which can be volatile depending on revenue and fuel prices), usage of net operating losses, whether "bonus depreciation" provisions are available, any future tax reform efforts at the federal level, as well as other legislative changes that are beyond our control. In 2017 , we made tax payments, net of refunds, totaling $177 million , and had an effective tax rate of 14.3% largely due to the impact of the Tax Cuts and Jobs Act. We expect our effective tax rate to be approximately 24.5% for 2018 and the effective rate of cash paid for income taxes to be approximately 10%-15% of book income, although these estimates are subject to change. We believe that we will have the liquidity available to make our future tax payments. CRITICAL ACCOUNTING ESTIMATES The discussion and analysis of our financial position and results of operations in this MD&A are based upon our consolidated financial statements. The preparation of these financial statements requires us to make estimates and judgments that affect our financial position and results of operations. See Note 1 to the consolidated financial statements for a description of our significant accounting policies. Critical accounting estimates are defined as those that reflect significant management judgment and uncertainties and that potentially may lead to materially different results under varying assumptions and conditions. Management has identified the following critical accounting estimates and has discussed the development, selection and disclosure of these policies with our audit committee. FREQUENT FLYER PROGRAMS Alaska's Mileage Plan loyalty program awards miles to members who fly on our airlines and our airline partners. We also sell services, including miles for transportation, to non-airline partners, such as hotels, car rental agencies and a major bank that offers Alaska affinity credit cards. In either case, the outstanding miles may be redeemed for travel on our airlines or any of our airline partners. As long as the Mileage Plan is in existence, we have an obligation to provide this future travel. For miles earned by guests who fly on us or our airline partners, we recognize a liability and a corresponding selling expense representing the incremental cost associated with the obligation to provide travel in the future. For services sold through one of our non-airline partners, the sales proceeds that represent award transportation and certificates for discounted companion travel are deferred and recognized when the transportation is delivered, and the remaining components are recorded as commission in other net revenue in the period the services are performed. Commission revenue recognized for the years ended December 31, 2017 , 2016 and 2015 was $396 million , $329 million and $280 million , respectively. The deferred revenue is recognized as passenger revenue when the award travel occurs, or the miles expire, and as other net revenue for awards issued and flown on partner airlines. At December 31, 2017 , we had approximately 220 billion miles and points outstanding, resulting in an aggregate liability and deferred revenue balance of $1.2 billion . Both the liability and the deferred revenue are determined based on several assumptions that require significant management judgment to estimate and formulate. There are uncertainties inherent in these estimates. Therefore, different assumptions could affect the amount and/or timing of revenue recognition or expenses. The most significant assumptions in accounting for the Mileage Plan are described below. 55 1. The rate at which we defer sales proceeds related to services sold through non-airline partners: We use the relative selling price method for the deferral of sales proceeds. For contracts that were modified after the effective date of Accounting Standards Update 2009-13, "Multiple-Deliverable Revenue Arrangements a consensus of the FASB Emerging Issues Task Force" (ASU 2009-13), we determined our best estimate of selling price by considering multiple inputs and methods including, but not limited to, the estimated selling price of comparable travel, discounted cash flows, brand value, published selling prices, number of miles awarded and the number of miles redeemed. We estimated the selling prices and volumes over the terms of the agreements in order to determine the allocation of proceeds to each of the multiple deliverables. This relative allocation is evaluated annually and updated according to changes in the assumptions of the volume of related deliverables. A 1% shift between the allocation of cash proceeds to travel deliverables from marketing deliverables would defer the timing of revenue recognition by approximately $9 million . 2. The number of miles that will not be redeemed for travel (breakage): The liability for outstanding Mileage Plan mileage credits includes all mileage credits that are expected to be redeemed, including mileage credits earned by members whose mileage account balances have not yet reached the minimum mileage credit level to redeem an award. Our estimate of the number of miles that will not be redeemed (breakage) considers historical activity in our members accounts and other factors. Based on statistical analysis of historical data, our current breakage rate is 17.4% . A hypothetical 1% change in our estimate of breakage has approximately a $10 million effect on the liability. 3. The number of miles used per award: We estimate how many miles will be used per award. For example, our members may redeem credit for award travel to various locations or choose between a highly restricted award and an unrestricted award. Our estimates are based on the current requirements in our Mileage Plan program and historical award redemption patterns. 4. The number of awards redeemed for travel on our airlines versus other airlines: The cost for us to carry an award passenger is typically lower than the cost we will pay to our travel partners. We estimate the number of awards that will be redeemed on our airlines versus on our travel partners and accrue the estimated costs based on historical redemption patterns. If the number of awards redeemed on our travel partner is higher or lower than estimated, we may need to adjust our liability and corresponding expense. 5. The costs that will be incurred to provide award travel for miles earned by guests who fly on us or our airline partners: When a frequent flyer travels on his or her award ticket on one of our airlines, incremental costs such as food, fuel and insurance are incurred to carry that passenger. We estimate what these costs will be (excluding any contribution to overhead and profit) and accrue a liability. If the guest travels on another airline on an award ticket, we often must pay the other airline for carrying the guest. The other airline costs are based on negotiated agreements and are often substantially higher than the costs we would incur to carry that guest. We estimate how much we will pay to other airlines for future travel awards based on historical redemptions and settlements with other carriers and accrue a liability accordingly. The costs actually incurred by us or paid to other airlines may be higher or lower than the costs that were estimated and accrued, and therefore we may need to adjust our liability and recognize a corresponding expense. We regularly review significant Mileage Plan assumptions and change our assumptions if facts and circumstances indicate that a change is necessary. Any such change in assumptions could have a significant effect on our financial position and results of operations. See further discussion below for the impact to the accounting of frequent flyer programs due to the new revenue recognition accounting standard. PENSION PLANS Our actuarial estimates of pension liability, the related expense and the associated significant assumptions are discussed in Note 7 to the consolidated financial statements. The calculation of pension expense and the corresponding liability requires the use of a number of key assumptions, including the expected long-term rate of return on plan assets and the assumed discount rates to be used in the calculation of the projected 56 benefit obligation and the interest and service cost. Changes in these assumptions can result in different expense and liability amounts, and future actual experience can differ from these assumptions. Pension liability and future pension expense decrease as the discount rate used for the obligation increases. We discounted future pension obligations using rates between 3.69% and 3.78% at December 31, 2017 and between 4.29% and 4.50% at December 31, 2016 . The discount rates were determined using current rates earned on high-quality, long-term bonds with maturities that correspond with the estimated cash distributions from each one of the defined-benefit pension plans. The discount rates we use are based on a yield curve that uses a pool of higher-yielding bonds estimated to be more in line with settlement rates, as we have taken steps to ultimately terminate or settle plans that are frozen and move toward freezing benefits in active plans in the future. If the discount rate decreased by 0.5% , our projected benefit obligation at December 31, 2017 would increase by approximately $163 million . Pension expense normally increases as the expected rate of return on pension plan assets decreases. As of December 31, 2017 , we estimate that the pension plan assets will generate long-term rates of return between 4.25% and 5.50% , which compares to 5.5% and 6.00% at December 31, 2016 . We regularly review the actual asset allocation and periodically rebalance investments as appropriate. This expected long-term rate of return on plan assets at December 31, 2017 is based on an allocation of U.S. and non-U.S. equities, U.S. fixed-income securities, and real estate. A decrease in the expected long-term rate of return of 0.5% would increase our estimated 2018 pension expense by approximately $10 million . All of our defined-benefit pension plans are now closed to new entrants. Additionally, benefits in our non-union defined-benefit plans were frozen January 1, 2014. Future changes in plan asset returns, assumed discount rates and various other factors related to the participants in our pension plans will impact our future pension expense and liabilities. We cannot predict what these factors will be in the future. See further discussion below for the impact to the accounting of pension plans due to the new retirement benefits accounting standard. BUSINESS COMBINATION ACCOUNTING, GOODWILL AND INTANGIBLES To record the value of assets acquired and liabilities assumed as a result of our acquisition of Virgin America on December 14, 2016, we have performed a purchase price allocation utilizing the best information available to management. The purchase price allocation is final as of December 14, 2017. The fair values of the assets acquired and liabilities assumed were determined using market, income or cost methods. Our consolidated balance sheet reflects goodwill in the amount of $ 1.9 billion at December 31, 2017 , representing the excess of the purchase price over the fair value of Virgin America tangible and identifiable intangible assets and liabilities. Identifiable intangible assets recorded totaled approximately $ 141 million at December 31, 2017 and consisted of customer relationships, airport slots and gates. With the exception of airport slots, all of the identified intangible assets are finite-lived and are being amortized over their estimated economic useful lives. Goodwill and indefinite-lived intangible assets are not amortized, but will be tested for impairment at least annually (in the fourth quarter), or more frequently if events or circumstances indicate that an impairment may exist. Our impairment analysis may include a qualitative assessment to determine whether it is more likely than not that a reporting unit or intangible asset group is impaired. If we do not perform a qualitative assessment, or if we determine it is more likely than not that the fair value of the reporting unit or intangible asset group exceeds its carrying amount, we will calculate the estimated fair value of the reporting unit or intangible asset group and an impairment charge would be recorded to reduce the carrying value to the estimated fair value. Qualitative factors that might indicate a need to perform an impairment analysis outside of the regular annual assessment could include, but are not limited to: 1) reduced passenger demand as a result of domestic or global economic conditions; 2) significantly ongoing higher prices for jet fuel; 3) significant ongoing lower fares or passenger yields as a result of increased competition or lower demand; 4) a significant increase in future capital expenditure commitments; and 5) significant disruptions to our operations as a result of both internal and external events such as terrorist activities, actual or threatened war, labor actions by employees, or further industry regulation. Our business combination accounting, as well as future impairment analyses, require management to make assumptions and apply judgment. Key assumptions include, but are not limited to, estimating future cash flows, selecting discount rates and selecting valuation methodologies. These estimates and assumptions are highly subjective and our ability to realize the future cash flows used in our fair value calculations may be affected by changes in economic condition, our economic performance or business strategies. 57 ADOPTION OF NEW ACCOUNTING STANDARDS The new Revenue Recognition standard issued by the Financial Accounting Standards Board (FASB) replaces most existing revenue recognition guidance in U.S. GAAP, and is effective for the Company beginning January 1, 2018. The most significant change to the financial statements resulting from the new standard is revenue recognition related to the frequent flyer program revenues and liabilities. Historically, we have used the incremental cost approach for miles earned through travel. This approach has been eliminated with the new standard. Instead, we are required to allocate a portion of the ticket price for each ticket flown, or miles earned, through a relative selling price model and defer revenue recognition until a mileage award is redeemed and flown, or unused mileage credits expire. As our Mileage Plan program is growing, the Company expects revenue deferred will exceed revenue earned under the new standard for miles earned through travel. Further, unused ticket revenue that was previously recorded at the time of expiration will now be recorded at the original departure date if that ticket has not been changed or refunded prior to that date, based on estimates of expected expiration using historical patterns. We estimate the change in ticket breakage methodology will not have a significant impact on the statements of operations, but will result in a reduction in air traffic liability compared to previously reported balances. The new standard also requires us to present ancillary revenues related to passenger travel as Passenger Revenue. Historically, such ancillary revenues have been presented as Other Revenues. Further, some ancillary revenues related to passenger travel will be recognized at the date of travel rather than the date of sale under the new standard. It is worth noting that the standard impacts the timing of revenue recognition, and is not indicative of a weaker revenue environment. Additionally, the standard does not impact the timing of cash flows. Although less significant, the new retirement benefits accounting standard is also effective January 1, 2018. Under this new standard, all components of net periodic benefit cost will be presented in Nonoperating income (expense), except service cost, which will remain in Wages and benefits. This change has an impact on CASM excluding fuel and special items. Management believes it is useful to compare forecasted results with the restated results under the new standards. We have provisionally modeled the impacts of the revenue recognition standard and the pension accounting standard, and expect the following changes to the statements of operations for the years ending December 31, 2016 and December 31, 2017. All adjustments and recast amounts below are subject to finalization upon implementation in 2018.
