Item 7. Management Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations The following discussion should be read in conjunction with the financial statements and notes thereto appearing elsewhere in this report. Forward-Looking Statements This Report on Form 10-K contains forward-looking statements within the meaning of the federal securities laws, principally, but not only, under the captions Business and Growth Strategies, Risk Factors and Management Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations. We caution investors that any forward-looking statements in this report, or which management may make orally or in writing from time to time, are based on management beliefs and on assumptions made by, and information currently available to, management. When used, the words anticipate, believe, expect, intend, may, might, plan, estimate, project, should, will, result and similar expressions which do not relate solely to historical matters are intended to identify forward-looking statements. These statements are subject to risks, uncertainties and assumptions and are not guarantees of future performance, which may be affected by known and unknown risks, trends, uncertainties and factors that are beyond our control. Should one or more of these risks or uncertainties materialize, or should underlying assumptions prove incorrect, actual results may vary materially from those anticipated, estimated or projected. We caution you that, while forward-looking statements reflect our good faith beliefs when we make them, they are not guarantees of future performance and are impacted by actual events when they occur after we make such statements. We expressly disclaim any responsibility to update our forward-looking statements, whether as a result of new information, future events or otherwise. Accordingly, investors should use caution in relying on past forward-looking statements, which are based on results and trends at the time they are made, to anticipate future results or trends. Some of the risks and uncertainties that may cause our actual results, performance or achievements to differ materially from those expressed or implied by forward-looking statements include, among others, the following: general risks affecting the real estate industry (including, without limitation, the inability to enter into or renew leases, dependence on tenants financial condition, and competition from other developers, owners and operators of real estate); risks associated with the availability and terms of financing and the use of debt to fund acquisitions and developments; failure to manage effectively our growth and expansion into new markets or to integrate acquisitions successfully; risks and uncertainties affecting property development and construction (including, without limitation, construction delays, cost overruns, inability to obtain necessary permits and public opposition to such activities); risks associated with downturns in the national and local economies, increases in interest rates, and volatility in the securities markets; costs of compliance with the Americans with Disabilities Act and other similar laws; potential liability for uninsured losses and environmental contamination; risks associated with our potential failure to qualify as a REIT under the Internal Revenue Code of 1986, as amended, and possible adverse changes in tax and environmental laws; risks associated with our dependence on key personnel whose continued service is not guaranteed; and the other risk factors identified in this Form 10-K, including those described under the caption Risk Factors. 37 Table of Contents The risks included here are not exhaustive. Other sections of this report, including Part I, Item I Business Risk Factors, include additional factors that could adversely affect our business and financial performance. Moreover, we operate in a very competitive and rapidly changing environment. New risk factors emerge from time to time and it is not possible for management to predict all such risk factors, nor can we assess the impact of all such risk factors on our business or the extent to which any factor, or combination of factors, may cause actual results to differ materially from those contained in any forward-looking statements. Given these risks and uncertainties, investors should not place undue reliance on forward-looking statements as a prediction of actual results. Investors should also refer to our quarterly reports on Form 10-Q for future periods and current reports on Form 8-K as we file them with the SEC, and to other materials we may furnish to the public from time to time through Forms 8-K or otherwise. Overview We are a fully integrated self-administered and self-managed REIT and one of the largest owners and developers of Class A office properties in the United States. Our properties are concentrated in four core markets Boston, midtown Manhattan, Washington, D.C. and San Francisco. We generate revenue and cash primarily by leasing our Class A office space to our tenants. Factors we consider when we lease space include creditworthiness of the tenant, the length of the lease, the rental rate to be paid, costs of tenant improvements, operating costs and real estate taxes, vacancy, current and anticipated future demand for office space and general economic factors. Improvement in our industry performance is generally predicated on a sustained pattern of job growth. Office market conditions, generally viewed as having bottomed out in 2003, showed further improvement during 2004 in midtown Manhattan, Washington, D.C. and Princeton, New Jersey. In Boston and San Francisco, our two other markets, we are cautiously optimistic that we are seeing the beginning of a recovery in job growth that will generate additional demand for office space. Even in those markets where tenants are expanding, however, landlord pricing power is still constrained by the number of competitive alternatives available. In this climate, we believe our corporate strategy of owning and developing high-quality office buildings concentrated in strong, supply-constrained markets and emphasizing long-term leases to creditworthy tenants has allowed us to perform well relative to our peers in difficult markets and even better in favorable markets. In addition, we believe our financial strategy of matching long-term fixed-rate debt with our long-term leases insulates us from rising interest costs and, accordingly, we have fixed the interest rate on 91% of our outstanding debt. During 2004, our strategy enabled us to complete more than six million square feet of leasing while managing transactions costs and non-recurring capital expenses. In addition, we commenced construction on $286.8 million of new developments which we expect will be placed into service during 2006 and 2007. Other highlights of our 2004 activity include the following. We completed the construction of two development projects, the 1,234,218 square-foot Times Square Tower building in New York City, New York and the 257,400 square-foot New Dominion Technology Park, Building Two building in Fairfax County, Virginia. Times Square Tower and New Dominion Technology Park, Building Two are currently 87.8% and 100.0% leased, respectively. We leveraged our strong relationships to acquire $97.2 million of interests in real estate assets in the Washington, D.C. area, and we acquired our partner interest in a joint venture in the Boston suburbs for $21.6 million in cash and the assumption of our partner share of the mortgage debt on the properties of approximately $41.6 million. We sold eighteen properties totaling 767,000 square feet and three land parcels for sale prices totaling $117 million. On March 3, 2004, we completed a public offering of 5,700,000 shares of our common stock at a price to the public of $51.40 per share. The proceeds from this public offering, net of underwriters discount and offering costs, totaled approximately $291.1 million. We used the proceeds from this offering to 38 Table of Contents repay approximately $110.3 million in mortgage indebtedness related to three properties, together with prepayment penalties totaling approximately $6.3 million as well as to acquire the remaining interest in one of our joint ventures for approximately $21.6 million. We formed the Value-Added Fund, which is a strategic partnership with two institutional investors, to pursue the acquisition of assets within our existing markets that have deficiencies in property characteristics which provide an opportunity to create value through repositioning, refurbishment or renovation. Looking ahead, we believe 2005 will follow a pattern similar to that of 2004, with office rental markets continuing to strengthen, but with improvement coming gradually. We expect allocators of capital to continue to place a premium on high-quality, well located office buildings resulting in lower capitalization rates and higher prices per square foot. As an owner of these types of assets, we are pleased with higher valuations and intend to sell non-core properties to realize some of this value. However, these conditions also make it more difficult to acquire assets at what we believe to be attractive rates of return. We will continue to be patient as markets recover, demand grows and development proceeds on the significant pre-lease projects underway and stand ready to aggressively capitalize on opportunities with our well-positioned balance sheet where we can use our competitive edge to enhance performance. Critical Accounting Policies The preparation of financial statements in conformity with accounting principles generally accepted in the United States of America, or GAAP, requires management to use judgment in the application of accounting policies, including making estimates and assumptions. We base our estimates on historical experience and on various other assumptions believed to be reasonable under the circumstances. These judgments affect the reported amounts of assets and liabilities and disclosure of contingent assets and liabilities at the dates of the financial statements and the reported amounts of revenue and expenses during the reporting periods. If our judgment or interpretation of the facts and circumstances relating to various transactions had been different, it is possible that different accounting policies would have been applied resulting in a different presentation of our financial statements. From time to time, we evaluate our estimates and assumptions. In the event estimates or assumptions prove to be different from actual results, adjustments are made in subsequent periods to reflect more current information. Below is a discussion of accounting policies that we consider critical in that they may require complex judgment in their application or require estimates about matters that are inherently uncertain. Real Estate Upon acquisitions of real estate, we assess the fair value of acquired tangible and intangible assets, including land, buildings, tenant improvements, above- and below-market leases, origination costs, acquired in-place leases, other identified intangible assets and assumed liabilities in accordance with Statement of Financial Accounting Standards ( SFAS ) No. 141, Business Combinations and allocate the purchase price to the acquired assets and assumed liabilities, including land at appraised value and buildings at replacement cost. We assess and consider fair value based on estimated cash flow projections that utilize appropriate discount and/or capitalization rates, as well as available market information. Estimates of future cash flows are based on a number of factors including the historical operating results, known and anticipated trends, and market and economic conditions. The fair value of the tangible assets of an acquired property considers the value of the property as if it were vacant. We also consider an allocation of purchase price of other acquired intangibles, including acquired in-place leases that may have a customer relationship intangible value, including (but not limited to) the nature and extent of the existing relationship with the tenants, the tenants credit quality and expectations of lease renewals. Based on our acquisitions to date, our allocation to customer relationship intangible assets has been immaterial. We record acquired above- and below-market leases at their fair value (using a discount rate which reflects the risks associated with the leases acquired) equal to the difference between (1) the contractual amounts 39 Table of Contents to be paid pursuant to each in-place lease and (2) management estimate of fair market lease rates for each corresponding in-place lease, measured over a period equal to the remaining term of the lease for above-market leases and the initial term plus the term of any below-market fixed rate renewal options for below-market leases. Other intangible assets acquired include amounts for in-place lease values that are based on our evaluation of the specific characteristics of each tenant lease. Factors to be considered include estimates of carrying costs during hypothetical expected lease-up periods considering current market conditions, and costs to execute similar leases. In estimating carrying costs, we include real estate taxes, insurance and other operating expenses and estimates of lost rentals at market rates during the expected lease-up periods, depending on local market conditions. In estimating costs to execute similar leases, we consider leasing commissions, legal and other related expenses. Real estate is stated at depreciated cost. The cost of buildings and improvements includes the purchase price of property, legal fees and other acquisition costs. Costs directly related to the development of properties are capitalized. Capitalized development costs include interest, internal wages, property taxes, insurance, and other project costs incurred during the period of development. Management reviews its long-lived assets used in operations for impairment when there is an event or change in circumstances that indicates an impairment in value. An impairment loss is recognized if the carrying amount of its assets is not recoverable and exceeds its fair value. If such impairment is present, an impairment loss is recognized based on the excess of the carrying amount of the asset over its fair value. The evaluation of anticipated cash flows is highly subjective and is based in part on assumptions regarding future occupancy, rental rates and capital requirements that could differ materially from actual results in future periods. Since cash flows on properties considered to be long-lived assets to be held and used as defined by SFAS No. 144 Accounting for the Impairment or Disposal of Long-Lived Assets, ( SFAS No. 144 ) are considered on an undiscounted basis to determine whether an asset has been impaired, our established strategy of holding properties over the long term directly decreases the likelihood of recording an impairment loss. If our strategy changes or market conditions otherwise dictate an earlier sale date, an impairment loss may be recognized and such loss could be material. If we determine that impairment has occurred, the affected assets must be reduced to their fair value. No such impairment losses have been recognized to date. SFAS No. 144, which was adopted on January 1, 2002, requires that qualifying assets and liabilities and the results of operations that have been sold, or otherwise qualify as held for sale, be presented as discontinued operations in all periods presented if the property operations are expected to be eliminated and we will not have significant continuing involvement following the sale. The components of the property net income that is reflected as discontinued operations include the net gain (or loss) upon the disposition of the property held for sale, operating results, depreciation and interest expense (if the property is subject to a secured loan). Following the classification of a property as held for sale, no further depreciation is recorded on the assets. A variety of costs are incurred in the acquisition, development and leasing of properties. After determination is made to capitalize a cost, it is allocated to the specific component of a project that is benefited. Determination of when a development project is substantially complete and capitalization must cease involves a degree of judgement. Our capitalization policy on development properties is guided by SFAS No. 34 Capitalization of Interest Cost and SFAS No. 67 Accounting for Costs and the Initial Rental Operations of Real Estate Properties. The costs of land and buildings under development include specifically identifiable costs. The capitalized costs include pre-construction costs essential to the development of the property, development costs, construction costs, interest costs, real estate taxes, salaries and related costs and other costs incurred during the period of development. We consider a construction project as substantially completed and held available for occupancy upon the completion of tenant improvements, but no later than one year from cessation of major construction activity. We cease capitalization on the portion substantially completed and occupied or held available for occupancy, and capitalizes only those costs associated with the portion under construction. 40 Table of Contents Investments in Unconsolidated Joint Ventures Except for ownership interests in variable interest entities, we account for our investments in joint ventures under the equity method of accounting because we exercise significant influence over, but do not control, these entities. These investments are recorded initially at cost, as Investments in Unconsolidated Joint Ventures, and subsequently adjusted for equity in earnings and cash contributions and distributions. Any difference between the carrying amount of these investments on our balance sheet and the underlying equity in net assets is amortized as an adjustment to equity in earnings of unconsolidated joint ventures over 40 years or the term of the agreement, if shorter. Under the equity method of accounting, our net equity is reflected within the Consolidated Balance Sheets, and our share of net income or loss from the joint ventures is included within the Consolidated Statements of Operations. The joint venture agreements may designate different percentage allocations among investors for profits and losses, however, our recognition of joint venture income or loss generally follows the joint venture distribution priorities, which may change upon the achievement of certain investment return thresholds. For ownership interest in variance interest entities, we consolidate those in which we are the primary beneficiary. Revenue Recognition Base rental revenue is reported on a straight-line basis over the terms of our respective leases. In accordance with SFAS No. 141, we recognize rental revenue of acquired in-place above- and below-market leases at their fair values over the terms of the respective leases. Accrued rental income represents rental income recognized in excess of rent payments actually received pursuant to the terms of the individual lease agreements. Our leasing strategy is generally to secure financially stable tenants that meet our underwriting guidelines. Furthermore, following the initiation of a lease, we continue to actively monitor the tenant creditworthiness to ensure that all tenant related assets are recorded at their realizable value. When assessing tenant credit quality, we: Review relevant financial information, including: financial ratios; net worth; debt to market capitalization; and liquidity evaluate the depth and experience of the tenant management team perform an analysis of the tenant industry As a result of the underwriting process, tenants are then categorized into one of three categories: low risk tenants the tenant credit is such that we require collateral require security deposit; and reduce upfront tenant improvement investment tenant credit is below our acceptable parameters 41 Table of Contents We maintain a rigorous process of monitoring the credit quality of our tenant base. We provide an allowance for doubtful accounts arising from estimated losses that could result from the tenant inability to make required current rent payments and an allowance against accrued rental income for future potential loses that we deem to be unrecoverable over the term of the lease. Tenant receivables are assigned a credit rating of 1-4 with a rating of 1 representing the highest possible rating with no allowance recorded and a rating of 4 representing the lowest credit rating, recording a full reserve against the receivable balance. Among the factors considered in determining the credit rating include: payment history; credit status and change in status (credit ratings for public companies are used as a primary metric); change in tenant space needs (i.e., expansion/downsize); tenant financial performance; and industry or geographical specific credit considerations If our estimates of collectibility differ from the cash received, the timing and amount of our reported revenue could be impacted. The average remaining term of our in-place tenant leases was approximately 7.6 years as of December 31, 2004. The credit risk is mitigated by the high quality of our existing tenant base, reviews of prospective tenants risk profiles prior to lease execution and continual monitoring of our portfolio to identify potential problem tenants. Recoveries from tenants, consisting of amounts due from tenants for common area maintenance, real estate taxes and other recoverable costs, are recognized as revenue in the period the expenses are incurred. Tenant reimbursements are recognized and presented in accordance with Emerging Issues Task Force, or EITF, Issue 99-19 Reporting Revenue Gross as a Principal versus Net as an Agent, or Issue 99-19. Issue 99-19 requires that these reimbursements be recorded on a gross basis, as we are generally the primary obligor with respect to purchasing goods and services from third-party suppliers, have discretion in selecting the supplier and have credit risk. Our hotel revenues are derived from room rentals and other sources such as charges to guests for long-distance telephone service, fax machine use, movie and vending commissions, meeting and banquet room revenue and laundry services. Hotel revenues are recognized as earned. Management fees are recorded and earned based on a percentage of collected rents at the properties under management, and not on a straight-line basis, since such fees are contingent upon the collection of rents. Gains on sales of real estate are recognized pursuant to the provisions of SFAS No. 66, Accounting for Sales of Real Estate. The specific timing of the sale is measured against various criteria in SFAS No. 66 related to the terms of the transactions and any continuing involvement in the form of management or financial assistance associated with the properties. If the sales criteria are not met, we defer gain recognition and account for the continued operations of the property by applying the finance, installment or cost recovery methods, as appropriate, until the sales criteria are met. Depreciation and Amortization We compute depreciation and amortization on our properties using the straight-line method based on estimated useful asset lives. In accordance with SFAS No. 141, we allocate the acquisition cost of real estate to land, building, tenant improvements, acquired above- and below-market leases, origination costs and acquired in-place leases based on an assessment of their fair value and depreciate or amortize these assets over 42 Table of Contents their useful lives. The amortization of acquired above- and below-market leases and acquired in-place leases is recorded as an adjustment to revenue and depreciation and amortization, respectively, in the Consolidated Statements of Operations. Fair Value of Financial Instruments For purposes of disclosure, we calculate the fair value of our mortgage debt notes payable and unsecured senior notes. We discount the spread between the future contractual interest payments and future interest payments on our mortgage debt and unsecured notes based on a current market rate. In determining the current market rate, we add our estimate of a market spread to the quoted yields on federal government treasury securities with similar maturity dates to our own debt. Because our valuations of our financial instruments are based on these types of estimates, the fair value of our financial instruments may change if our estimates do not prove to be accurate. Results of Operations The following discussion is based on our Consolidated Financial Statements for the years ended December 31, 2004, 2003 and 2002. Commencing during the third quarter of 2002, we began reporting on a consolidated basis the gross operating revenues and expenses associated with the ownership of our hotels through our taxable REIT subsidiary, whereas we had previously only reported net lease payments and real estate taxes. As a result, the reporting of the hotel operations for the year ended December 31, 2003 is not directly comparable to the year ended 2002. At December 31, 2004 and 2003, we owned or had interests in a portfolio of 125 and 140 properties, respectively (the Total Property Portfolio ). As a result of changes within our Total Property Portfolio, the financial data presented below shows significant changes in revenue and expenses from period-to-period. Accordingly, we do not believe that our period-to-period financial data are comparable. Therefore, the comparison of operating results for the year ended 2004 and 2003 show separately changes attributable to the properties that were owned by us throughout each period compared (the Same Property Portfolio ) and the changes attributable to the Total Property Portfolio. In our analysis of operating results, particularly to make comparisons of net operating income between periods meaningful, it is important to provide information for properties that were in-service and owned by us throughout each period presented. We refer to properties acquired or placed in-service prior to the beginning of the earliest period presented and owned by us through the end of the latest period presented as our Same Property Portfolio. The Same Property Portfolio therefore excludes properties placed in-service acquired or repositioned after the beginning of the earliest period presented or disposed of prior to the end of the latest period presented. Net operating income, or NOI, is a non-GAAP financial measure equal to net income available to common shareholders, the most directly comparable GAAP financial measure, plus minority interest in Operating Partnership, net derivative losses, depreciation and amortization, interest expense, general and administrative expense, losses from early extinguishments of debt and losses on investments in securities, less gains on sales of real estate from discontinued operations (net of minority interest), income from discontinued operations (net of minority interest), gains on sales of real estate and land held for development (net of minority interest), income from unconsolidated joint ventures, minority interest in property partnerships, interest and other income and development and management services income. We use NOI internally as a performance measure and believe NOI provides useful information to investors regarding our financial condition and results of operations because it reflects only those income and expense items that are incurred at the property level. Therefore, we believe NOI is a useful measure for evaluating the operating performance of our real estate assets. 43 Table of Contents Our management also uses NOI to evaluate regional property level performance and to make decisions about resource allocations. Further, we believe NOI is useful to investors as a performance measure because, when compared across periods, NOI reflects the impact on operations from trends in occupancy rates, rental rates, operating costs and acquisition and development activity on an unleveraged basis, providing perspective not immediately apparent from net income. NOI excludes certain components from net income in order to provide results that are more closely related to a property results of operations. For example, interest expense is not necessarily linked to the operating performance of a real estate asset and is often incurred at the corporate level as opposed to the property level. In addition, depreciation and amortization, because of historical cost accounting and useful life estimates, may distort operating performance at the property level. NOI presented by us may not be comparable to NOI reported by other REITs that define NOI differently. We believe that in order to facilitate a clear understanding of our operating results, NOI should be examined in conjunction with net income as presented in our consolidated financial statements. NOI should not be considered as an alternative to net income as an indication of our performance or to cash flows as a measure of liquidity or ability to make distributions. Comparison of the year ended December 31, 2004 to the year ended December 31, 2003 The table below shows selected operating information for the Same Property Portfolio and the Total Property Portfolio. The Same Property Portfolio consists of 112 properties, including three hotels and three properties in which we have joint venture interests, acquired or placed in service on or prior to January 1, 2003 and owned by us through December 31, 2004. The Total Property Portfolio includes the effect of the other properties either, placed in-service, acquired or repositioned after January 1, 2003 or disposed of on or prior to December 31, 2004. This table includes a reconciliation from Same Property Portfolio to Total Property Portfolio by also providing information for the properties which were sold, acquired, placed in-service or repositioned for the years ended December 31, 2004 and 2003. Our net property operating margins, which are defined as rental revenue less operating expenses, exclusive of the three hotel properties, for the year ended December 31, 2004 and 2003, were 69.1% and 69.5%, respectively. 44 Table of Contents Same Property Portfolio Properties Sold Properties Acquired Properties Placed In- Service Properties Repositioned Total Property Portfolio (dollars in thousands) 2004 2003 Increase/ (Decrease) % Change 2004 2003 2004 2003 2004 2003 2004 2003 2004 2003 Increase/ (Decrease) % Change Rental Revenue: Rental Revenue $ 1,146,166 $ 1,147,870 ($ 1,704 ) (0.15 %) $ 138 $ 4,532 $ 77,893 $ 24,796 $ 50,735 $ 9,455 $ 14,369 $ 16,457 $ 1,289,301 $ 1,203,110 $ 86,191 7.17 % Termination Income 3,724 6,136 (2,412 ) (39.31 %) 267 3,991 6,136 (2,145 ) (34.96 %) Total Rental Revenue 1,149,890 1,154,006 (4,116 ) (0.36 %) 138 4,532 78,160 24,796 50,735 9,455 14,369 16,457 1,293,292 1,209,246 84,046 6.95 % Operating Expenses 390,097 384,574 5,523 1.44 % 39 1,222 17,416 5,078 7,199 2,230 4,271 4,205 419,022 397,309 21,713 5.47 % Net Operating Income, excluding hotels 759,793 769,432 (9,639 ) (1.25 %) 99 3,310 60,744 19,718 43,536 7,225 10,098 12,252 874,270 811,937 62,333 7.68 % Hotel Net Operating Income 20,618 17,833 2,785 15.62 % 20,618 17,833 2,785 15.62 % Consolidated Net Operating Income (1) 780,411 787,265 (6,854 ) (0.87 %) 99 3,310 60,744 19,718 43,536 7,225 10,098 12,252 894,888 829,770 65,118 7.85 % Other Revenue: Development and Management services 20,464 17,347 3,117 17.97 % Interest and Other 10,367 3,033 7,334 241.81 % Total Other Revenue 30,831 20,380 10,451 51.28 % Other Expenses: General and administrative 53,636 45,359 8,277 18.25 % Interest 306,170 299,436 6,734 2.25 % Depreciation and amortization 217,002 197,155 19,847 10.07 % 22 518 18,947 6,452 11,215 2,506 5,070 1,859 252,256 208,490 43,766 21.00 % Net derivative losses 1,038 (1,038 ) (100.00 %) Losses from early extinguishments of debt 6,258 1,474 4,784 324.56 % Total Other Expenses 217,002 197,155 19,847 10.07 % 22 518 18,947 6,452 11,215 2,506 5,070 1,859 618,320 555,797 62,523 11.25 % Income before minority interests 563,409 590,110 (26,701 ) (4.53 %) 77 2,792 41,797 13,266 32,321 4,719 5,028 10,393 307,399 294,353 13,046 4.44 % Income from unconsolidated joint ventures 3,054 1,903 1,151 60.49 % 304 4,113 (33 ) 55 3,380 6,016 (2,636 ) (43.82 %) Income from discontinued operations, net of minority interest 1,240 6,102 1,240 6,102 (4,862 ) (79.68 %) Minority interests in property partnerships 4,685 1,827 2,858 156.43 % Minority interest in Operating Partnership (68,174 ) (73,784 ) 5,610 7.61 % Gains on sales of real estate, net of minority interest 8,149 57,574 (49,425 ) (85.85 %) Gains on sales of real estate from discontinued operations, net of minority interest 27,338 73,234 (45,896 ) (62.67 %) Net Income available to common shareholders $ 284,017 $ 365,322 ($ 81,305 ) (22.26 %) (1) For a detailed discussion of NOI, including the reasons management believes NOI is useful to investors, see page 71. 45 Table of Contents Rental Revenue The increase in rental revenue of $86.2 million in the Total Property Portfolio primarily relates to the purchase of the remaining interests in One and Two Discovery Square as of April 1, 2003, the remaining interests in One and Two Freedom Square as of August 5, 2003, 1333 New Hampshire Avenue on October 8, 2003 and 140 Kendrick Street as of March 24, 2004, as well as the acquisition of 1330 Connecticut Avenue on April 1, 2004. These additions to the portfolio increased revenue by approximately $53.1 million, as detailed below: Property Date Acquired Revenue for the year ended 2004 2003 Change (in thousands) One and Two Discovery Square April 1, 2003 $ 13,131 $ 9,541 $ 3,590 One and Two Freedom Square August 5, 2003 29,938 11,731 18,207 1333 New Hampshire Avenue October 8, 2003 15,480 3,524 11,956 140 Kendrick Street March 24, 2004 8,474 8,474 1330 Connecticut Avenue April 1, 2004 10,870 10,870 Total $ 77,893 $ 24,796 $ 53,097 In addition, the placing into service of Times Square Tower and New Dominion Technology Park, Building Two during the third quarter of 2004, as well as Shaws Supermarket and Waltham Weston Corporate Center during 2003, increased revenue by approximately $41.3 million for the year ended December 31, 2004, as detailed below: Property Date Placed in Service Revenue for the year ended 2004 2003 Change (in thousands) Times Square Tower 3 rd Quarter 2004 $ 36,470 $ 2,463 $ 34,007 Waltham Weston Corporate Center 1 st Quarter 2003 6,599 4,613 1,986 Shaws Supermarket 2 nd Quarter 2003 3,263 2,379 884 New Dominion Technology Park, Building Two 3 rd Quarter 2004 4,403 4,403 Total $ 50,735 $ 9,455 $ 41,280 The aggregate increase in rental revenue was offset by a decrease of approximately $4.4 million due to the sale of 2300 N Street during 2003 and Hilltop Office Center during 2004, both of which have not been classified as discontinued operations due to our continued involvement in the management of the properties. The decrease in the remaining Same Property Portfolio reflects a decrease in straight-line rents of $7.6 million, which was partially offset by an increase in rental revenue, including operating income, parking and other income, of approximately $5.9 million for the year ended December 31, 2004. We anticipate that we will experience a roll down of approximately 15% to 20% in rents in 2005 on our expiring leases which will be partially offset by increased occupancy and greater contributions from newly delivered buildings such as Times Square Tower and New Dominion Technology Park, Building Two. In September 2004, we commenced the redevelopment of our Capital Gallery property in Washington, D.C. Capital Gallery is a Class A office property totaling approximately 397,000 square feet. The project entails removing a three-story low-rise section of the property comprised of 100,000 square feet from in-service status and developing it into a 10-story office building resulting in a total complex size of approximately 610,000 square feet upon completion. The classification of this property is included in Properties Repositioned for the year ended December 31, 2004. Rental revenue has decreased for the year ended December 31, 2004 due to taking the three-story low rise out of service in September 2004. 46 Table of Contents Termination Income Termination income for the year ended December 31, 2004 was related to twenty tenants across the portfolio that terminated their leases and made termination payments totaling approximately $4.0 million. This compared to termination income earned for the year ended December 31, 2003 related to nineteen tenants totaling $6.1 million. We have experienced a reduction in the number of tenants having trouble paying rent and bankruptcy issues. In addition, fewer tenants have been making efforts to terminate or restructure their leases in order to provide them with financial relief. Interest and Other Income Interest and other income increased by $7.3 million for the year ended December 31, 2004. In the first quarter of 2004 we recognized a net amount of approximately $7.0 million in connection with the termination by a third-party of an agreement to enter into a ground lease with us. At the end of the fourth quarter of 2004, we had a cash balance of approximately $239.3 million which also contributed to higher interest earnings. To the extent we do not use our cash balance to acquire properties, fund new developments, or reduce outstanding indebtedness, we anticipate interest income to increase slightly based on anticipated increases in interest rates. Operating Expenses Property operating expenses in the Total Property Portfolio (real estate taxes, utilities, insurance, repairs and maintenance, cleaning and other property-related expenses) increased by $21.7 million. Same Property Portfolio real estate tax expense increased approximately $7.4 million for the year end due to increased real estate tax assessments, specifically in New York City. This increase was offset by a decrease of approximately $2.3 million across the portfolio in repairs and maintenance expenses for the year end as well as increases in other expenses of approximately $0.5 million, resulting in a net increase to Same Property Portfolio operating expenses of approximately $5.5 million. Approximately $12.3 million of the increase in Total Property Portfolio operating expenses primarily relates to the additions of One and Two Discovery Square, One and Two Freedom Square, 1333 New Hampshire Avenue, 140 Kendrick Street and 1330 Connecticut Avenue, as detailed below: Property Date Acquired Operating Expenses for the year ended 2004 2003 Change (in thousands) One and Two Discovery Square April 1, 2003 $ 2,775 $ 1,939 $ 836 One and Two Freedom Square August 5, 2003 6,901 2,499 4,402 1333 New Hampshire Avenue October 8, 2003 3,541 640 2,901 140 Kendrick Street March 24, 2004 1,213 1,213 1330 Connecticut Avenue April 1, 2004 2,986 2,986 Total $ 17,416 $ 5,078 $ 12,338 47 Table of Contents In addition, the placing into service of Times Square Tower and New Dominion Technology Park, Building Two during the third quarter of 2004, as well as Shaws Supermarket and Waltham Weston Corporate Center during 2003, increased operating expenses by approximately $5.0 million, as detailed below: Property Date Placed in Service Operating Expenses for the year ended 2004 2003 Change (in thousands) Times Square Tower 3 rd Quarter 2004 $ 4,054 $ $ 4,054 Waltham Weston Corporate Center 1 st Quarter 2003 2,360 2,022 338 Shaws Supermarket 2 nd Quarter 2003 364 208 156 New Dominion Technology Park, Building Two 3 rd Quarter 2004 421 421 Total $ 7,199 $ 2,230 $ 4,969 These increases were offset by a decrease of an aggregate of $1.2 million related to the sales of 2300 N Street in 2003 and Hilltop Office Center in 2004, both of which have not been classified as discontinued operations due to our continued involvement in the management of the properties. Our Capital Gallery property in Washington, D.C. has been classified as Properties Repositioned for the year ended December 31, 2004. Hotel Net Operating Income Net operating income for the hotel properties increased by approximately $2.8 million, or approximately 15.62%, for the year ended December 31, 2004 compared to the year ended December 31, 2003. On a year to year comparison, the hotels showed improvement and we expect this improvement to continue into 2005. The following reflects our occupancy and rate information for the three hotel properties for the year ended December 31, 2004 and 2003: 2004 2003 Increase Occupancy 80.6 % 77.3 % 4.3 % Average daily rate $ 175.32 $ 166.40 5.4 % Revenue per available room, REVPAR $ 141.69 $ 128.78 10.0 % Development and Management Services Our third-party fee income increased approximately $3.1 million for the year ended 2004 compared to 2003. Our third-party fees in Washington, D.C. with National Institute of Health and in New York at 90 Church Street collectively increased development and management services by $1.6 million for the year ended December 31, 2004. The completion of these projects along with the winding down of other projects is expected to result in a decrease of approximately $10.0 million of third-party management income in 2005. We will continue to pursue new fee services during 2005 and in future years; however, 2005 will be focused on our increased pipeline of development projects which we commenced in 2004. Our management fees increased approximately $1.5 million for the year ended December 31, 2004 compared to 2003. Other Expenses General and Administrative General and administrative expenses in the Total Property Portfolio increased for the year ended December 31, 2004 as compared to the year ended December 31, 2003 by $8.3 million, or 18.25%. An aggregate of approximately $1.8 million of the increase is attributable to changes in the form of long-term equity-based compensation, as further described below. During the fourth quarter we exercised our right to terminate the purchase agreement to acquire the 21-acre site on the Boston waterfront known as Fan Pier. In conjunction with 48 Table of Contents the termination, we recognized approximately $1.1 million of general and administrative expense consisting of our share of the forfeited deposit of $0.8 million and approximately $0.3 million of related due diligence costs. In addition, we recognized an expense of $0.75 million representing our payment to Alan B. Landis in connection with the amendment to the development agreement, as further detailed in Note 23 to the Consolidated Financial Statements. Other major increases during 2004 included the following: (1) increases in state taxes based on income and net worth of approximately $1.2 million; (2) increases of approximately $0.8 million in professional fees in connection with the Sarbanes-Oxley Act as well as fees related to increased responsibilities of our Board of Directors; and (3) an increase of approximately $2.3 million related to bonus and salaries for the year ended December 31, 2004. In 2003, we issued restricted stock and/or LTIP Units, as opposed to granting stock options and restricted stock, under the 1997 Stock Option and Incentive Plan as our primary vehicle for employee equity compensation. An LTIP unit is generally the economic equivalent of a share of our restricted stock. Employees vest in restricted stock and LTIP Units over a five-year term (0%, 0%, 25%, 35%, and 40%). Restricted stock and LTIP Units are measured at fair market value on the date of grant based on the number of shares or units granted and the closing price of our common stock on the date of grant as reported on the New York Stock Exchange. Such value is recognized as an expense ratably over the corresponding employee service period. To the extent restricted stock or LTIP Units are forfeited prior to vesting, the corresponding previously recognized expense is reversed as an offset to Stock-based compensation. Stock-based compensation expense associated with restricted stock was approximately $4.0 million for the year ended December 31, 2004. Stock-based compensation expense associated with $6.1 million of restricted stock that was granted in January 2003 will generally be expensed ratably as such restricted stock vests over a five-year vesting period. Stock-based compensation associated with approximately $9.7 million granted in January 2004 and approximately $12.5 million granted in January 2005 of restricted stock and LTIP units will also be incurred ratably as such restricted stock and LTIP Units vest. To the extent we continue to grant restricted stock and LTIP awards, our expenses will continue to increase significantly until 2008 even if there are no future increases in the aggregate value of restricted equity granted each year. This is because we expense the value of the restricted stock and LTIP awards ratably over the five-year vesting period and a full run-rate will not be achieved until 2008. 49 Table of Contents Interest Expense Interest expense for the Total Property Portfolio increased approximately $6.7 million. The majority of the increase is due to the cessation of interest capitalization at Times Square Tower and New Dominion Technology Park, Building Two, as well as the acquisition of 140 Kendrick Street and 1330 Connecticut Avenue, which were offset by the repayment of outstanding mortgage debt on One and Two Reston Overlook, as well as the Lockheed Martin building and NIMA building in the beginning of 2004. Our floating rate debt now consists entirely of our refinanced construction loan on Times Square Tower. The following summarizes our outstanding debt as of December 31, 2004 compared with 2003. December 31, 2004 2003 (dollars in thousands) Debt Summary: Balance Fixed rate $ 4,588,024 $ 4,566,188 Variable rate 423,790 438,532 Total $ 5,011,814 $ 5,004,720 Percent of total debt: Fixed rate 91.54 % 91.24 % Variable rate 8.46 % 8.76 % Total 100.00 % 100.00 % Weighted average interest rate at end of period: Fixed rate 6.66 % 6.67 % Variable rate 3.36 % 2.87 % Total 6.38 % 6.33 % Depreciation and Amortization Depreciation and amortization expense for the Total Portfolio increased as a result of the acquisitions of One and Two Discovery Square, One and Two Freedom Square, 1333 New Hampshire Avenue, 140 Kendrick Street and 1330 Connecticut Avenue as well as the properties placed in service during 2003 and 2004. These additions to the portfolio increased depreciation and amortization expense by approximately $21.2 million, as detailed below: Depreciation for the year ended Property Acquired/Placed in Service 2004 2003 Change (in thousands) One and Two Freedom Square Acquired $ 7,435 $ 3,004 $ 4,431 Times Square Tower Placed in-service 7,067 7,067 1333 New Hampshire Avenue Acquired 4,287 1,139 3,148 One and Two Discovery Square Acquired 3,364 2,309 1,055 Waltham Weston Corporate Center Placed in-service 2,549 2,152 397 1330 Connecticut Avenue Acquired 2,292 2,292 140 Kendrick Street Acquired 1,569 1,569 Shaws Supermarket Placed in-service 542 354 188 New Dominion Technology Park, Building Two Placed in-service 1,057 1,057 Total Additions $ 30,162 $ 8,958 $ 21,204 50 Table of Contents In September 2004, we commenced the redevelopment of our Capital Gallery property in Washington, D.C. which is classified as Properties Repositioned for the year ended December 31, 2004. In connection with the redevelopment project, we recognized an accelerated depreciation charge of approximately $2.6 million, which represents the net book value of the portion of the three-story, low-rise portion of the building which will be redeveloped. Capitalized Costs Costs directly related to the development of rental properties are not included in our operating results. These costs are capitalized and included in real estate assets and amortized over their useful lives. Capitalized development costs include interest, wages, property taxes, insurance and other project costs incurred during the period of development. Capitalized wages for the year ended December 31, 2004 and 2003 were $5.9 million and $5.0 million, respectively. These costs are not included in the general and administrative expenses discussed above. Interest capitalized for the year ended December 31, 2004 and 2003 was $10.8 million and $19.2 million, respectively. These costs are not included in the interest expense referenced above. During the third quarter of 2004, we placed the development projects comprised of Times Square Tower and New Dominion Technology Park, Building Two into service and ceased capitalizing interest in accordance with our capitalization policy. Net Derivative Losses Net derivative losses for the Total Property Portfolio represent the adjustments to fair value and cash settlements of our derivative contract that are not effective for accounting purposes. The fair value of our derivative contract, which was $1.2 million at December 31, 2004, is included within our consolidated balance sheets. As a result of to the expiration of this derivative contract in February 2005, we will have no further earnings volatility on the remaining derivative contract. See Part II-Item 7A- Quantitative and Qualitative Disclosures about Market Risk. Joint Ventures The decrease in income from unconsolidated joint ventures in the Total Property Portfolio is related to purchasing the remaining interests in 140 Kendrick Street, One and Two Freedom Square and One and Two Discovery Square. 140 Kendrick Street is included in the Total Property Portfolio as of March 24, 2004. One and Two Freedom Square are included in the Total Property Portfolio as of August 5, 2003. One and Two Discovery Square are included in the Total Property Portfolio as of April 1, 2003. The reclassification of these properties caused the overall income from unconsolidated joint ventures to decrease $3.8 million, which was offset by an increase in Same Property Joint Venture income of approximately $1.2 million. Included in our share of Same Property Joint Venture income is termination income of approximately $1.8 million, of which our share is approximately $1.0 million earned in the second quarter of 2004. Joint Ventures acquired during 2004 include 801 New Jersey Avenue and the Value-Added Fund. Included in the Value-Added Fund is approximately $0.2 million of initial organization costs which resulted in a net loss for the year ended December 31, 2004. 51 Table of Contents Other The decrease in income from discontinued operations in the Total Property Portfolio for the year ended December 31, 2004 was a result of properties sold or designated as held for sale during the end of 2003 and beginning of 2004 which are no longer included in our operations as of December 31, 2004. Below is a list of properties included in discontinued operations for the year ended December 31, 2004 and 2003: Year ended December 31, 2004 Year ended December 31, 2003 Sugarland Business Park-Building One Sugarland Business Park-Building One 204 Second Avenue 204 Second Avenue 560 Forbes Boulevard 560 Forbes Boulevard Decoverly Two, Three, Six and Seven Decoverly Two, Three, Six and Seven 38 Cabot Boulevard 38 Cabot Boulevard The Arboretum The Arboretum 430 Rozzi Place 430 Rozzi Place Sugarland Business Park-Building Two Sugarland Business Park-Building Two 875 Third Avenue The Candler Building Gains on the sales of real estate for the year ended December 31, 2004 in the Total Property Portfolio relate to the sale of Hilltop Office Center and a land parcel in Burlington, MA. Gains on sales of real estate for the year ended December 31, 2003 primarily relate to the sale of 2300 N Street. These properties are not included in discontinued operations due to our continuing involvement in the management, for a fee equivalent to market, of these properties after the sales. Properties included in our gains on sales of real estate from discontinued operations for the year ended December 31, 2004 and 2003 in the Total Portfolio are shown below: Year ended December 31, 2004 Date Disposed Year ended December 31, 2003 Date Disposed 430 Rozzi Place January 2004 The Candler Building January 2003 Sugarland Business Park-Building Two February 2004 875 Third Avenue February 2003 Decoverly Two, Three, Six and Seven April 2004 The Arboretum April 2004 38 Cabot Boulevard May 2004 Sugarland Business Park-Building One August 2004 204 Second Avenue September 2004 560 Forbes Boulevard December 2004 Comparison of the year ended December 31, 2003 to the year ended December 31, 2002 The table below shows selected operating information for the Same Property Portfolio and the Total Portfolio. The Same Property Portfolio consists of 107 properties, including three hotels and three properties in which we have joint venture interests, acquired or placed in service on or prior to January 1, 2002 and owned by us through December 31, 2003. The Total Property Portfolio includes the effect of the other properties either placed in service or acquired after January 1, 2002 or disposed of on or prior to December 31, 2004. This table includes a reconciliation from Same Property Portfolio to Total Property Portfolio, detailing properties which were sold, acquired or placed into service for the years ended December 31, 2003 and 2002. Our net property operating margins, which are defined as rental revenue less operating expenses exclusive of the three hotel properties for the year ended December 31, 2003 and 2002, were approximately 69.5% and 69.1%, respectively. 52 Table of Contents Same Property Portfolio Properties Sold Properties Acquired Properties Placed In-Service Total Property Portfolio 2003 2002 Increase/ (Decrease) % Change 2003 2002 2003 2002 2003 2002 2003 2002 Increase/ (Decrease) % Change (dollars in thousands) Rental Revenue: Rental Revenue $ 911,760 $ 908,337 $ 3,423 0.38 % $ 4,532 $ 48,169 $ 153,829 $ 33,886 $ 132,989 $ 103,052 $ 1,203,110 $ 1,093,444 $ 109,666 10.03 % Termination Income 6,136 6,805 (669 ) (9.84 %) 15 6,136 6,820 (684 ) (10.03 %) Total Rental Revenue 917,896 915,142 2,754 0.30 % 4,532 48,184 153,829 33,886 132,989 103,052 1,209,246 1,100,264 (1) 108,982 9.91 % Operating Expenses 325,535 318,076 7,549 2.35 % 1,222 12,300 38,272 8,384 32,280 22,980 397,309 361,740 (2) 35,569 9.84 % Net Operating Income, excluding hotels 592,361 597,066 (4,705 ) (0.79 %) 3,310 35,884 115,557 25,502 100,709 80,072 811,937 738,524 73,413 9.94 % Hotel Net Operating Income (3) 17,833 23,216 (5,383 ) (23.19 %) 17,833 23,216 (5,383 ) (23.19 %) Consolidated Net Operating Income (3) 610,194 620,282 (10,088 ) (1.63 %) 3,310 35,884 115,557 25,502 100,709 80,072 829,770 761,740 68,030 8.93 % Other Revenue: Development and Management Services 17,347 10,748 6,599 61.40 % Interest and other 3,033 5,504 (2,471 ) (44.90 %) Total Other Revenue 20,380 16,252 4,128 25.40 % Other Expenses: General and administrative 45,359 47,292 (1,933 ) (4.09 %) Interest 299,436 263,067 36,369 13.83 % Depreciation and amortization 153,693 145,819 7,874 5.40 % 518 4,813 26,120 5,202 28,159 22,329 208,490 178,163 30,327 17.03 % Net derivative losses 1,038 11,874 (10,836 ) (91.26 %) Losses from early extinguishments of debt 1,474 2,386 (912 ) (38.23 %) Loss on investment in securities 4,297 (4,297 ) (100.0 %) Total Other Expenses 153,693 145,819 7,874 5.40 % 518 4,813 26,120 5,202 28,159 22,329 555,797 507,079 48,718 9.61 % Income before minority interests 456,501 474,463 (17,962 ) (3.79 %) 2,792 31,071 89,437 20,300 72,550 57,743 294,353 270,913 23,440 8.66 % Income from unconsolidated joint ventures 1,901 3,111 (1,210 ) (38.90 %) 4,115 4,843 6,016 7,954 (1,938 ) (24.37 %) Income from discontinued operations, net of minority interest 4,170 5,465 (1,295 ) (23.70 %) 1,932 14,755 6,102 20,220 (14,118 ) (69.83 %) Minority interests in property partnerships 1,827 2,408 (581 ) (24.13 %) Minority interest in Operating Partnership (73,784 ) (72,900 ) (884 ) (1.22 %) Gains on sales of real estate, net of minority interest 57,574 186,810 (129,236 ) (69.18 %) Gains on sales of land held for development, net of minority interest 3,633 (3,633 ) (100.00 %) Gains on sales of real estate from discontinued operations, net of minority interest 73,234 25,345 47,889 188.95 % Preferred dividend (3,412 ) 3,412 100.00 % Net Income available to common shareholders $ 365,322 $ 440,971 ($ 75,649 ) (17.16 %) (1) Excludes Hotel Revenue of $12,702 for the years ended December 31, 2002.

For a detailed discussion of NOI, including the reasons management believes NOI is useful to investors, see page 71. 53 Table of Contents Rental Revenue The increase in rental revenue of $109.7 million in the Total Property Portfolio primarily relates to new leases signed and in place in connection with the acquisition of 399 Park Avenue in the third quarter of 2002, the purchase of the remaining interests in One and Two Discovery Square as of April 1, 2003, the purchase of the remaining interests in One and Two Freedom Square as of August 5, 2003, as well as the purchase of 1333 New Hampshire Avenue as of October 8, 2003. These additions to the portfolio increased revenue by approximately $119.9 million, as described below: Revenue for the year ended Property Date Acquired 2003 2002 Change (in thousands) 399 Park Avenue September 25, 2002 $ 129,033 $ 33,886 $ 95,147 One and Two Discovery Square April 1, 2003 9,541 9,541 One and Two Freedom Square August 5, 2003 11,731 11,731 1333 New Hampshire Ave October 8, 2003 3,524 3,524 Total Additions $ 153,829 $ 33,886 $ 119,943 This increase was offset by a decrease of $43.6 million due to the sale of One and Two Independence Square and 2300 N Street during 2002 and 2003 as well as Hilltop Office Center during 2004, all of which have not been classified as discontinued operations due to our continuing involvement in the management of the properties. During 2002 we placed into service Five Times Square and other properties detailed below. These additions contributed approximately $29.9 million of revenue. Revenue for the year ended Property Date Placed in Service 2003 2002 Change (in thousands) 5 Times Square 1st Quarter 2002 $ 74,247 $ 57,807 $ 16,440 111 Huntington Avenue 2nd Quarter 2002 49,161 40,917 8,244 Waltham Weston Corporate Center 1st Quarter 2003 4,614 2,542 2,072 Shaws Supermarket 2nd Quarter 2003 2,379 2,379 Broad Run Business Park 4th Quarter 2002 1,768 1,073 695 ITT Educational Services 1st Quarter 2002 820 713 107 Total $ 132,989 $ 103,052 $ 29,937 The overall increase in the remaining Same Property Portfolio reflects an increase in straight line rents of approximately $5.6 million resulting from increased free rent periods on renewals during 2003 as well as an increase in operating expense reimbursements related to higher operating expenses. These increases were partially offset by a decrease in rental revenue, including operating income, parking and other income, of approximately $2.2 million and a slight decrease in occupancy. Termination Income Termination income for the year ended December 31, 2003 was related to nineteen tenants across the portfolio that terminated their leases and made termination payments totaling approximately $6.1 million. This compared to termination income earned for the year ended December 31, 2002 related to twenty three tenants totaling $6.8 million. Interest and Other Income Interest and other income decreased by $2.5 million in the Total Portfolio for the year ended December 31, 2003. Of the total variance, $1.0 million is a result of interest earned on a note receivable related to the sale of real estate in September 2002. In addition, during 2002 there was a one-time refund of approximately $1.3 million, which related to the resolution of a prior-year tax matter. 54 Table of Contents Operating Expenses Property operating expenses (real estate taxes, utilities, insurance, repairs and maintenance, cleaning and other property-related expenses) in the Total Property Portfolio increased by $35.6 million. The additions of 399 Park Avenue, 1333 New Hampshire Avenue, One and Two Discovery Square and One and Two Freedom Square increased operating expenses by approximately $29.9 million, as described below: Operating Expenses for the year ended Property Date Acquired 2003 2002 Change (in thousands) 399 Park Avenue September 25, 2002 $ 33,195 $ 8,384 $ 24,811 One and Two Discovery Square April 1, 2003 1,939 1,939 One and Two Freedom Square August 5, 2003 2,498 2,498 1333 New Hampshire Ave October 8, 2003 640 640 Total Additions $ 38,272 $ 8,384 $ 29,888 The increases were offset by a decrease of $11.1 million related to One and Two Independence Square and 2300 N Street which were sold during 2002 and 2003, as well as the sale of Hilltop Office Center during 2004, all of which have not been classified as discontinued operations due to our continuing involvement in the management of the properties. In addition, the continued lease-up of 111 Huntington Avenue, Five Times Square and the additional properties detailed below contributed approximately $9.3 million of operating expenses: Operating Expenses for the year ended Property Date Placed in Service 2003 2002 Change (in thousands) 5 Times Square 1st Quarter 2002 $ 13,697 $ 8,774 $ 4,923 111 Huntington Avenue 2nd Quarter 2002 15,221 12,684 2,537 Waltham Weston Corporate Center 1st Quarter 2003 2,022 1,096 926 Shaws Supermarket 2nd Quarter 2003 208 208 Broad Run Business Park 4th Quarter 2002 370 131 239 ITT Educational Services 1st Quarter 2002 74 54 20 611 Gateway Boulevard 3rd Quarter 2003 688 241 447 Total $ 32,280 $ 22,980 $ 9,300 Property operating expenses in the Same Property Portfolio increased during the year ended December 31, 2003 primarily due to increases in real estate taxes of $6.7 million, or 5.70%, and increases in insurance of $1.4 million, or 13.33%. The increases in real estate taxes are due to higher property tax assessments and rate increases, specifically in New York, which represented $5.1 million of the increase. Increases in insurance premiums in the Same Property Portfolio and Total Portfolio are related to increases in premium rates on existing coverage as well as the increased cost to purchase coverage under the federal Terrorism Risk Insurance Act of 2002. Other decreases were mainly due to an overall decrease in occupancy from 93.9% at December 31, 2002 to 92.1% at December 31, 2003. Hotel Net Operating Income Net operating income for the hotel properties decreased by $5.4 million or approximately 23.2% for the year ended December 31, 2003 compared to the year ended December 31, 2002. These decreases were due to the continued downturn experienced in business travel and the tourism industry in the Boston market. 55 Table of Contents The following reflects our occupancy and rate information for the three hotel properties for the years ended December 31, 2003 and 2002: 2003 2002 Decrease Occupancy 77.3 % 80.7 % (4.2 %) Average daily rate $ 166.40 $ 181.13 (8.1 %) Revenue per available room, REVPAR $ 128.78 $ 146.25 (11.9 %) Development and Management Services The increase in development and management services income of $6.6 million primarily resulted from the recognition of fees in 2003 on certain third-party development projects, some of which began in 2002, and an overall increase in management fees due to the continuing involvement in properties sold during 2003. Development fees increased by $2.8 million on the 90 Church Street project in New York City related to the services provided to remediate damages resulting from the events of September 11, 2001. There was an overall increase of $1.1 million in development fees in Washington, D.C. on the National Institute of Health and 901 New York Avenue projects. During 2003, approximately $1.8 million was recognized as development fees on the construction of the residential building, The Belvidere in Boston, MA. The remaining increases relate to new management agreements entered into with the sale of 2300 N Street and One and Two Independence Square for the year ended December 31, 2003. Our third-party revenue is project specific and highly dependent on our ability to secure third-party development contracts. Other Expenses General and Administrative General and administrative expenses in the Total Property Portfolio decreased during the year ended December 31, 2003 as compared to the year ended December 31, 2002 by $1.9 million or 4.09%. A decrease of $2.8 million is related to the write-off of unrecoverable leasing commissions related to our termination of the lease with Arthur Andersen for 620,947 square feet at the Times Square Tower during the second quarter of 2002. In addition, an increase of $2.2 million is attributed to changes in the form of equity-based compensation, as further described below. In 2003, we issued restricted stock and/or LTIP units, as opposed to granting stock options and restricted stock, under the 1997 Stock Option and Incentive Plan as our primary vehicle for employee equity compensation. Employees vest in restricted stock and LTIP units over a five-year term. Restricted stock and LTIP units are measured at fair market value on the date of grant based on the number of shares or units granted and the closing price of our Common Stock on the date of grant as reported on the New York Stock Exchange. Such value is recognized as an expense ratably over the corresponding employee service period. To the extent restricted stock or LTIP units are forfeited prior to vesting, the corresponding previously recognized expense is reversed as an offset to Stock-based compensation. Stock-based compensation expense associated with restricted stock was $2.2 million during the year ended December 31, 2003. Stock-based compensation associated with $6.1 million of restricted stock that was granted in January 2003 will generally be expensed ratably as such restricted stock vests over a five-year vesting period. Stock-based compensation associated with approximately $9.7 million of restricted stock and LTIP units that were granted in January 2004 will also be incurred ratably as such restricted stock and LTIP units vest. Interest Expense Interest expense for the Total Portfolio increased as a result of our strategic decision to replace our variable rate debt with primarily unsecured fixed rate debt and a decrease in the amount of capitalized interest on development projects which was instead expensed. This was primarily due to placing into service and cessation of interest capitalization on Five Times Square, 111 Huntington Avenue, Two Freedom Square, Shaw 56 Table of Contents Supermarket and 611 Gateway Boulevard and the issuance of $1.5 billion of unsecured fixed-rate senior notes (including $750 million issued in December 2002). Our total debt outstanding at December 31, 2003 was approximately $5.0 billion compared to $5.1 billion at December 31, 2002. December 31, 2003 2002 (dollars in thousands) Debt Summary: Balance Fixed rate $ 4,566,188 $ 3,890,196 Variable rate 438,532 1,257,024 Total $ 5,004,720 $ 5,147,220 Percent of total debt: Fixed rate 91.24 % 75.58 % Variable rate 8.76 % 24.42 % Total 100.00 % 100.00 % Weighted average interest rate at end of period: Fixed rate 6.67 % 7.17 % Variable rate 2.87 % 3.04 % Total 6.33 % 6.03 % Depreciation and Amortization Depreciation and amortization expense for the Total Property Portfolio increased $30.3 million. Approximately $26.7 million of the increase was a result of the acquisition of 399 Park Avenue, One and Two Discovery Square, One and Two Freedom Square and 1333 New Hampshire Avenue, as well as the properties placed in service after January 1, 2002. The increases were offset by decreases of $4.3 million related to properties that were sold during 2002 and 2003 that were not classified as discontinued operations.

These costs are capitalized and amortized over their useful lives. Capitalized development costs include interest, wages, 57 Table of Contents property taxes, insurance and other project costs incurred during the period of development. Capitalized wages for the year ended December 31, 2003 and 2002 were $5.0 million and $5.1 million, respectively. These costs are not included in the general and administrative expenses discussed above. Interest capitalized for the year ended December 31, 2003 and 2002 was $19.2 million and $22.5 million, respectively. These costs are not included in the interest expense referenced above. Net Derivative Losses Net derivative losses for the Total Portfolio represent the mark-to-market and cash settlements of our derivative contracts, consisting of interest rate swaps, payments that were not effective for accounting purposes. The fair value of our derivative contract, which was $8.2 million at December 31, 2003, is included within our consolidated balance sheets. As a result of to the expiration of this derivative contract in February 2005, we will have no further earnings volatility on the remaining derivative contract. See Part II-Item 7A Quantitative and Qualitative Disclosures about Market Risk. Joint Ventures The decrease in income from unconsolidated joint ventures in the Total Portfolio as well as the Same Property Portfolio is related to the purchase of the remaining interests in One and Two Discovery Square, One and Two Freedom Square and 140 Kendrick Street. One and Two Discovery Square are included in the Total Portfolio Revenue as of April 1, 2003. One and Two Freedom Square are included in the Total Portfolio Revenue as of August 5, 2003. 140 Kendrick Street is included in the Total Portfolio as of March 24, 2004. The reclassification of these properties caused the overall income from joint ventures to decrease for the year ended December 31, 2003. Other The decrease in income from discontinued operations in the Total Portfolio for the year ended December 31, 2003 was a result of properties sold or designated as held for sale during the end of 2002 and beginning of 2003 which are no longer included as of December 31, 2003. Below is a list of properties included in discontinued operations for the year ended December 31, 2003 and 2002: Year ended December 31, 2003 Year ended December 31, 2002 Sugarland Business Park-Building One Sugarland Business Park-Building One 204 Second Avenue 204 Second Avenue 560 Forbes Boulevard 560 Forbes Boulevard Decoverly Two, Three, Six and Seven Decoverly Two, Three, Six and Seven 38 Cabot Boulevard 38 Cabot Boulevard The Arboretum The Arboretum 430 Rozzi Place 430 Rozzi Place Sugarland Business Park-Building Two Sugarland Business Park-Building Two 875 Third Avenue 875 Third Avenue The Candler Building The Candler Building Fullerton Square 7600 Boston Boulevard 7700 Boston Boulevard 2391 West Winton Avenue Gains on sales of real estate for the year ended December 31, 2003 related to the sale of 2300 N Street in the first quarter for a gain of $52.9 million. In the second and third quarter, there was a transfer of certain mortgage issuance costs that resulted in a gain of $4.8 million (net of minority interest share of $1.0 million.) Gains on sales of real estate for the year ended December 31, 2002 related to the sale of One and Two Independence Square and were not included in discontinued operations as we have continuing involvement through a third party management agreement after the sale. 58 Table of Contents Properties included in gains on sales of real estate from discontinued operations for the year ended December 31, 2003 and 2002 in the Total Portfolio are shown below: Year ended December 31, 2003 Date Disposed Year ended December 31, 2002 Date Disposed The Candler Building January 2003 Fullerton Square March 2002 875 Third Avenue February 2003 7600 Boston Boulevard March 2002 7700 Boston Boulevard March 2002 2391 West Winton Avenue December 2002 The decrease in our preferred dividend of $3.4 million for the year ended December 31, 2003 was a result of the conversion of 2,000,000 shares of our preferred stock into common stock in July 2002. Liquidity and Capital Resources General Our principal liquidity needs for the next twelve months are to: fund normal recurring expenses; meet debt service requirements including the repayment or refinancing of $564 million of indebtedness that matures within the twelve month period, $279 million of which is due in 2005 and the remainder in the first quarter of 2006; fund capital expenditures, including tenant improvements and leasing costs; fund current development costs not covered under construction loans; and make the minimum distribution required to maintain our REIT qualification under the Internal Revenue Code of 1986, as amended. We believe that these needs will be satisfied using our current cash balance, cash flows generated by operations and provided by financing activities. Rental revenue, recovery income from tenants, and other income from operations are our principal sources of capital used to pay operating expenses, debt service, recurring capital expenditures and the minimum distribution required to maintain our REIT qualification. We seek to increase income from our existing properties by maintaining quality standards for our properties that promote high occupancy rates and permit increases in rental rates while reducing tenant turnover and controlling operating expenses. Our sources of revenue also include third-party fees generated by our office real estate management, leasing, development and construction businesses. Consequently, we believe our revenue, together with proceeds from financing activities, will continue to provide the necessary funds for our short-term liquidity needs. However, material changes in these factors may adversely affect our net cash flows. Such changes, in turn, could adversely affect our ability to fund distributions, debt service payments and tenant improvements. In addition, a material adverse change in our cash provided by operations may affect our ability to comply with the financial performance covenants under our unsecured line of credit and unsecured senior notes. Our failure to comply with financial covenants could adversely impact our ability to access additional financing to fund our operations including distributions, debt service payments and capital expenditures. Our principal liquidity needs for periods beyond twelve months are for the costs of developments, property acquisitions, scheduled debt maturities, major renovations, expansions and other non-recurring capital improvements. We expect to satisfy these needs using one or more of the following: construction loans; long-term secured and unsecured indebtedness; income from operations; joint ventures; 59 Table of Contents sales of real estate; issuances of additional common and Preferred units of the Operating Partnership and/or our equity securities; and our unsecured revolving line of credit or other short term bridge facilities. We draw on multiple financing sources to fund our long-term capital needs. Our line of credit is utilized primarily as a bridge facility to fund acquisition opportunities and meet short-term development needs. We fund our development projects with construction loans that may be partially guaranteed by BPLP until project completion or lease-up thresholds are achieved. In 2003, we completed three offerings of unsecured investment grade senior notes and expect to utilize the bond market, asset backed mortgage financing and common and preferred equity as cost-effective capital sources for other long-term capital needs. Cash Flow Summary The following summary discussion of our cash flows is based on the consolidated statements of cash flows in Item 8. Financial Statements and Supplementary Data and is not meant to be an all-inclusive discussion of the changes in our cash flows for the periods presented below. Cash and cash equivalents were $239.3 million and $22.7 million at December 31, 2004 and December 31, 2003, respectively, representing an increase of $216.6 million. The increase was a result of the following increases and decreases in cash flows: Years ended December 31, 2004 2003 Increase (Decrease) (in thousands) Net cash provided by operating activities $ 429,506 $ 488,275 $ (58,769 ) Net cash provided by (used in) investing activities $ (171,014 ) $ 97,496 $ (268,510 ) Net cash used in financing activities $ (41,834 ) $ (618,360 ) $ 576,526 Our principal source of cash flow is related to the operation of our office properties. In addition, over the past year, we have recycled capital through the sale of some of our properties and raised proceeds from secured and unsecured borrowings. We also issued 5,700,000 shares of common stock in a public offering in March 2004. The average term of a tenant lease is approximately 7.6 years with occupancy rates historically in the range of 92% to 98%. Our properties provide a relatively consistent stream of cash flow that provides us with resources to pay operating expenses, debt service and fund quarterly dividend and distribution payment requirements. Cash is used in investing activities to fund acquisitions, development and recurring and nonrecurring capital expenditures. We selectively invest in new projects that enable us to take advantage of our development, leasing, financing and property management skills and invest in existing buildings that meet our investment criteria. Cash used in investing activities for the twelve months ended December 31, 2004 consisted of the following: (in thousands) Proceeds from the sales of real estate $ 107,614 The cash provided by investing is offset by: Net investments in unconsolidated joint ventures (944 ) Recurring capital expenditures (25,101 ) Planned non-recurring capital expenditures associated with acquisition properties (4,889 ) Hotel improvements, equipment upgrades and replacements (1,001 ) Acquisitions/additions to real estate (246,693 ) Net cash used in investing activities $ (171,014 ) 60 Table of Contents Cash used in financing activities for the year ended December 31, 2004 totaled approximately $41.8 million. This consisted of payments of dividends and distributions to shareholders and unitholders and changes to our existing debt structure, including the net repayment of certain mortgages, offset by the net proceeds of approximately $291.1 million from our common stock offering in March 2004 and proceeds from the exercising of employee stock options. Future debt payments are discussed below under the heading Capitalization. Capitalization At December 31, 2004, our total consolidated debt was approximately $5.0 billion. The weighted-average annual interest rate on our consolidated indebtedness was 6.38% and the weighted-average maturity was approximately 5.7 years. Debt to total market capitalization ratio, defined as total consolidated debt as a percentage of the market value of our outstanding equity securities plus our total consolidated debt, is a measure of leverage commonly used by analysts in the REIT sector. Our total market capitalization was approximately $13.9 billion at December 31, 2004. Total market capitalization was calculated using the December 31, 2004 closing stock price of $64.67 per common share and the following: (1) 110,320,485 shares of our common stock, (2) 21,552,166 outstanding common units of limited partnership of BPLP (excluding common units held by Boston Properties, Inc.), (3) an aggregate of 5,357,399 common units issuable upon conversion of all outstanding preferred units of limited partnership of BPLP, (4) an aggregate of 169,838 common units issuable upon conversion of all outstanding LTIP units, assuming all conditions have been met for the conversion of the LTIP units, and (5) our consolidated debt totaling approximately $5.0 billion. Our total consolidated debt at December 31, 2004 represented approximately 36.1% of our total market capitalization. This percentage will fluctuate with changes in the market price of our common stock and does not necessarily reflect our capacity to incur additional debt to finance our activities or our ability to manage our existing debt obligations. However, for a company like ours, whose assets are primarily income-producing real estate, the debt to total market capitalization ratio may provide investors with an alternate indication of leverage, so long as it is evaluated along with other financial ratios and the various components of our outstanding indebtedness. Debt Financing As of December 31, 2004, we had approximately $5.0 billion of outstanding indebtedness, representing 36.1% of our total market capitalization as calculated above under the heading Capitalization, consisting of $1.471 billion in publicly traded unsecured debt at an average interest rate of 5.95% with maturities ranging from 2013 to 2015 and $3.541 billion of property-specific debt. The table below summarizes our outstanding debt at December 31, 2004 and 2003: December 31, 2004 2003 (dollars in thousands) DEBT SUMMARY: Balance Fixed rate $ 4,588,024 $ 4,566,188 Variable rate 423,790 438,532 Total $ 5,011,814 $ 5,004,720 Percent of total debt: Fixed rate 91.54 % 91.24 % Variable rate 8.46 % 8.76 % Total 100.00 % 100.00 % Weighted average interest rate at end of period: Fixed rate 6.66 % 6.67 % Variable rate 3.36 % 2.87 % Total 6.38 % 6.33 % 61 Table of Contents The variable rate debt shown above bears interest based on various spreads over the London Interbank Offered Rate or Eurodollar rates. Unsecured Line of Credit On January 17, 2003, we extended our $605.0 million unsecured revolving credit facility (the Unsecured Line of Credit ) for a three year term expiring on January 17, 2006 with a provision for a one year extension at our option, subject to certain conditions. Outstanding balances under the Unsecured Line of Credit bear interest at a per annum variable rate of Eurodollar plus 0.70%. In addition, a facility fee equal to 20 basis points per annum is payable in quarterly installments. The interest rate and facility fee are subject to adjustment in the event of a change in BPLP senior unsecured debt ratings. The Unsecured Line of Credit contains a competitive bid option that allows banks that are part of the lender consortium to bid to make loan advances to us at a reduced Eurodollar rate. We utilize the Unsecured Line of Credit principally to fund development of properties, land and property acquisitions, and for working capital purposes. Our Unsecured Line of Credit is a recourse obligation of BPLP. We intend to extend, refinance or replace the Unsecured Line of Credit prior to its maturity in January 2006. Our ability to borrow under our unsecured revolving line of credit is subject to our compliance with a number of customary financial and other covenants on an ongoing basis, including: (1) an unsecured loan-to-value ratio against our total borrowing base not to exceed 60%, unless our leverage ratio exceeds 60%, in which case it is not to exceed 55%, (2) a secured debt leverage ratio not to exceed 55%, (3) a debt service coverage ratio of at least 1.40 for our borrowing base properties, (4) a fixed charge coverage ratio of at least 1.30 and a debt service coverage ratio of at least 1.50, (5) a leverage ratio not to exceed 60%, however for five consecutive quarters (not including the two quarters prior to expiration) the leverage ratio can go to 65%, (6) limitations on additional indebtedness and stockholder distributions, and (7) a minimum net worth requirement. As of December 31, 2004, we were in compliance with these financial restrictions and requirements. At December 31, 2004, we had letters of credit totaling $8.6 million outstanding under our Unsecured Line of Credit with the ability to borrow an additional $596.4 million under our Unsecured Line of Credit. As of March 4, 2005, we had no amount outstanding under our Unsecured Line of Credit. Unsecured Senior Notes During 2002, we completed an unregistered offering of $750 million in aggregate principal amount of BPLP 6.25% senior unsecured notes due January 15, 2013. The notes were only offered to qualified institutional buyers in the United States in reliance on Rule 144A under the Securities Act and to certain institutional investors outside of the United States in reliance on Regulation S under the Securities Act. The notes were priced at 99.65% of their principal amount to yield 6.296%. We used the net proceeds to reduce the amounts outstanding under our unsecured bridge loan that were borrowed in connection with the acquisition of 399 Park Avenue. During 2003, we issued an aggregate of $725 million of unsecured long-term debt at an average interest rate of 5.60% primarily to replace secured and unsecured, variable rate debt in the following offerings: On January 17, 2003, we completed an unregistered offering to qualified institutional buyers in reliance on Rule 144A under the Securities Act of an additional $175 million aggregate principal amount of BPLP 6.25% senior unsecured notes due January 15, 2013. The notes were priced at 99.763% of their principal amount to yield 6.28%. The additional notes are fungible, and form a single series, with the senior notes issued in December 2002. We used the net proceeds to repay the remaining balance of our unsecured bridge loan totaling approximately $105.7 million and to repay certain construction loans maturing in 2003 totaling approximately $60.0 million. 62 Table of Contents On March 18, 2003, we completed an unregistered offering to qualified institutional buyers in reliance on Rule 144A under the Securities Act of $300 million in aggregate principal amount of BPLP 5.625% senior unsecured notes due April 15, 2015. The notes were priced at 99.898% of their principal amount to yield 5.636%. We used the net proceeds to refinance the mortgage debt on Five Times Square and for other general business purposes. On May 22, 2003, we completed an unregistered offering to qualified institutional buyers in reliance on Rule 144A under the Securities Act of $250 million in aggregate principal amount of BPLP 5.0% senior unsecured notes due June 1, 2015. The notes were priced at 99.329% of their principal amount to yield 5.075%. We used the net proceeds to repay the mortgage loan secured by the property at 2600 Tower Oaks Boulevard in Maryland, repay in full amounts outstanding under the Unsecured Line of Credit and for other general business purposes. Our unsecured senior notes are redeemable at our option, in whole or in part, at a redemption price equal to the greater of (i) 100% of their principal amount or (ii) the sum of the present value of the remaining scheduled payments of principal and interest discounted at a rate equal to the yield on U.S. Treasury securities with a comparable maturity plus 35 basis points, in each case plus accrued and unpaid interest to the redemption date. The indenture under which our senior unsecured notes were issued contains restrictions on incurring debt and using our assets as security in other financing transactions and other customary financial and other covenants, including (1) a leverage ratio not to exceed 60%, (2) a secured debt leverage ratio not to exceed 50%, (3) an interest coverage ratio of 1.5, and (4) unencumbered asset value to be no less than 150% of our unsecured debt. As of December 31, 2004, we were in compliance with each of these financial restrictions and requirements. Under registration rights agreements with the initial purchasers of our senior unsecured notes, we agreed to use our reasonable best efforts to register with the SEC offers to exchange new notes issued by us, which we refer to as exchange notes, for the original notes. We closed the exchange offers relating to the 6.25% senior unsecured notes due January 15, 2013 on June 20, 2003, and we closed the exchange offer relating to the 5.625% senior unsecured notes due April 15, 2015 and 5.00% senior unsecured notes due June 1, 2015 on September 9, 2003. The exchange notes are in the same aggregate principal amount as and have terms substantially identical to the original notes, but the exchange notes are freely tradable by the holders, while the original notes were subject to resale restrictions. The exchange offers did not generate any cash proceeds for us. Boston Properties Limited Partnership investment grade ratings on its senior unsecured notes are as follows: Rating Organization Rating Moody Baa2 (stable) Standard & Poor BBB (stable) FitchRatings BBB (stable) The security rating is not a recommendation to buy, sell or hold securities, as it may be subject to revision or withdrawal at any time by the rating organization. Each rating should be evaluated independently of any other rating. Unsecured Bridge Loan On September 25, 2002, we obtained unsecured bridge financing totaling $1.0 billion in connection with the acquisition of 399 Park Avenue. During 2002, we repaid approximately $894.3 million with proceeds from the offering of unsecured senior notes and proceeds from the sales of certain real estate properties. At December 31, 2002, the unsecured bridge loan had an outstanding balance of approximately $105.7 million. During January 2003, we repaid all amounts outstanding under our unsecured bridge loan with proceeds from the January 2003 offering of senior unsecured notes. 63 Table of Contents Mortgage Debt At December 31, 2004, our total consolidated debt was approximately $5.0 billion. The weighted-average annual interest rate on our consolidated indebtedness was 6.38% and the weighted-average maturity was approximately 5.7 years. At December 31, 2004, our variable rate debt consisted of our construction loan on Times Square Tower. Variable rate debt encompassed only 8.46% of our total debt as of December 31, 2004. We plan on financing our larger development properties with property-specific construction debt because of the time associated with the development of those properties and we plan on utilizing our Unsecured Line of Credit for available transactions as they occur.

The LIBOR/Eurodollar rate at December 31, 2004 was 2.40% per annum. 64 Table of Contents (2) This facility totals $475.0 million and is comprised of two tranches. The first tranche consists of a $300.0 million loan commitment which bears interest at LIBOR plus 0.90% per annum and matures in January 2006. The first tranche includes a provision for a one-year extension at our option. The second tranche consists of a $175.0 million term loan which bears interest at LIBOR plus 1.00% per annum and matures in January 2007. (3) The lender option to purchase a 33.33% interest in the property in exchange for the cancellation of the principal balance of $225.0 million at maturity has expired and the lender no longer has the ability to acquire a portion of the building. (4) The mortgage loan matures on September 1, 2006 with an option held by the lender, subject to certain conditions, to extend the term to October 1, 2010. If extended, the loan will require payments of principal and interest at a fixed interest rate of 8.00% per annum based on a 27-year amortization period. (5) In accordance with EITF 98-1, the principal amount and interest rates shown were adjusted upon the acquisition of the property to reflect the fair value of the note. The stated principal balance at December 31, 2004 was $74.1 million and the stated interest rate was 7.75%. (6) The mortgage loan requires interest only payments through maturity. (7) In accordance with EITF 98-1, the principal amount and interest rates shown were adjusted upon acquisition of the property to reflect the fair value of the note. The stated principal balance at December 31, 2004 was $55.1 million and the stated interest rate was 7.51%. (8) In accordance with EITF 98-1, the principal amount and interest rates shown were adjusted upon acquisition of the property to reflect the fair value of the note. The stated principal balance at December 31, 2004 was $51.8 million and the stated interest rate was 7.58%. (9) In accordance with EITF 98-1, the principal amount and interest rates shown were adjusted upon the acquisition of the property to reflect the fair value of the note. The stated principal balance at December 31, 2004 was $52.4 million and the stated interest rate was 7.0%. (10) On February 17, 2005, we obtained construction financing for an additional $47.2 million collateralized by this property. The construction financing bears interest at a variable rate equal to LIBOR plus 1.65% per annum and matures in February 2008. (11) Includes outstanding indebtedness secured by 91 Hartwell Avenue. (12) Includes outstanding principal in the amounts of $19.0 million, $6.1 million and $2.9 million which bear interest at fixed rates of 6.70%, 8.54% and 6.75%, respectively. Combined aggregate principal payments of mortgage notes payable at December 31, 2004 are as follows (in thousands): Year 2005 $ 279,029 2006 557,123 2007 362,318 2008 974,758 2009 188,278 Thereafter 1,179,625 Market Risk Market risk is the risk of loss from adverse changes in market prices and interest rates. Our future earnings, cash flows and fair values relevant to financial instruments are dependent upon prevalent market interest rates, including refinancing risk on our fixed rate debt. Our primary market risk results from our indebtedness, which bears interest at fixed and variable rates. The fair value of our long-term debt obligations is affected by changes in the market interest rates. We manage our market risk, in part, by attempting to match our long-term leases with long- term fixed rate debt of similar duration. We also utilize certain derivative financial instruments at times to further reduce interest rate risk. Although certain derivative instruments were not effective for accounting purposes, derivatives have been used to convert a portion of our variable rate debt to a fixed rate, or to hedge 65 Table of Contents anticipated financing transactions. Derivatives are used solely for risk management purposes rather than speculation. Over 91% of our outstanding debt has fixed interest rates, which minimizes the interest rate risk until the maturity of such outstanding debt. For the year ended December 31, 2004, we had a derivative contract in a notional amount of $150 million. Prior to the modification described below, the derivative contract provided for a fixed interest rate of 6.35% when LIBOR is less than 5.80%, 6.70% when LIBOR is between 6.70% and 7.45%, and 7.50% when LIBOR is between 7.51% and 9.00% through February 2005. In August 2003, we modified the contract to provide for the counter party to pay us LIBOR and we are required to pay the counter party LIBOR in arrears plus 4.55% per annum on the notional amount of $150 million. The derivative contract expired in February 2005. In accordance with SFAS No. 133, the derivative agreement is reflected at its fair market value, which was a liability of $1.2 million at December 31, 2004. At December 31, 2004, our variable rate debt outstanding was approximately $424 million. At December 31, 2004, the average interest rate on variable rate debt was approximately 3.36%. If market interest rates on our variable rate debt had been 100 basis points greater, total interest would have increased approximately $4.2 million for the year ended December 31, 2004. At December 31, 2003, our variable rate debt outstanding was approximately $439 million. At December 31, 2003, the average interest rate on variable rate debt was approximately 2.87%. If market interest rates on our variable rate debt had been 100 basis points greater, total interest would have increased approximately $4.4 million for the year ended December 31, 2003. These amounts were determined solely by considering the impact of hypothetical interest rates on our financial instruments. Due to the uncertainty of specific actions we may undertake to minimize possible effects of market interest rate increases, this analysis assumes no changes in our financial structure. Funds from Operations Pursuant to the revised definition of Funds from Operations adopted by the Board of Governors of the National Association of Real Estate Investment Trusts ( NAREIT ), we calculate Funds from Operations, or FFO, by adjusting net income (loss) (computed in accordance with GAAP, including non-recurring items) for gains (or losses) from sales of properties, real estate related depreciation and amortization, and after adjustment for unconsolidated partnerships and joint ventures. FFO is a non-GAAP financial measure. The use of FFO, combined with the required primary GAAP presentations, has been fundamentally beneficial in improving the understanding of operating results of REITs among the investing public and making comparisons of REIT operating results more meaningful. Management generally considers FFO to be a useful measure for reviewing our comparative operating and financial performance because, by excluding gains and losses related to sales of previously depreciated operating real estate assets and excluding real estate asset depreciation and amortization (which can vary among owners of identical assets in similar condition based on historical cost accounting and useful life estimates), FFO can help one compare the operating performance of a company real estate between periods or as compared to different companies. Our computation of FFO may not be comparable to FFO reported by other REITs or real estate companies that do not define the term in accordance with the current NAREIT definition or that interpret the current NAREIT definition differently. In addition to presenting FFO in accordance with the NAREIT definition, we also disclose FFO after specific and defined supplemental adjustments, including (1) gains or losses on derivative instruments, consisting of changes in fair value and periodic cash settlements that do not qualify for hedge accounting pursuant to the provisions of SFAS No. 133 ( non-qualifying derivative contracts ) and (2) the effects of an early lease surrender. As the impact of the non-qualifying derivative contracts and early lease surrender adjustments did not extend beyond the year ended December 31, 2003, FFO as adjusted for the year ended December 31, 2004 is the same as FFO computed in accordance with the NAREIT definition. 66 Table of Contents The adjustments for non-qualifying derivative contracts resulted from interest rate contracts we entered into prior to the effective date of SFAS No. 133 to limit our exposure to fluctuations in interest rates with respect to variable rate debt associated with real estate projects under development. Upon transition to SFAS No. 133 on January 1, 2001, the impacts of these contracts were recorded in current earnings, while prior to that time they were capitalized. Although these adjustments are attributable to a single hedging program, the underlying contracts extended over multiple reporting periods and therefore resulted in adjustments from the first quarter of 2001 through the third quarter of 2003. Management presents FFO before the impact of non-qualifying derivative contracts because economically this interest rate hedging program was consistent with our risk management objective of limiting our exposure to interest rate volatility and the change in accounting under GAAP did not correspond to a substantive difference. Management does not currently anticipate structuring future hedging programs in a manner that would give rise to this kind of adjustment. The adjustments for early lease surrender resulted from a unique lease transaction related to the surrender of space by a tenant that was accounted for as a termination for GAAP purposes and recorded in income at the time the space was surrendered. However, we continued to collect payments monthly after the surrender of space through the month of July 2002, the date on which the terminated lease would otherwise have expired under its original terms. Management presents FFO after the early surrender lease adjustment because economically this transaction impacted periods subsequent to the time the space was surrendered by the tenant and, therefore, recording the entire amount of the lease termination payment in a single period made FFO less useful as an indicator of operating performance. Although these adjustments are attributable to a single lease, the transaction impacted multiple reporting periods and resulted in adjustments for the years ended December 31, 2002 and 2001. Management uses FFO principally to evaluate the operating performance of our assets from period to period, and therefore it is important that transactions which impact operations over multiple periods be reflected in FFO in accordance with their substance, even if GAAP requires that the income or loss attributable to the transaction be recorded in a particular period. The resulting adjustments to FFO computed in accordance with the NAREIT definition are particularly meaningful when the events in question are substantively equivalent to other similar transactions, but the reporting of those similar transactions under GAAP more closely matches their economic substance. Although our FFO as adjusted clearly differs from NAREIT definition of FFO, as well as that of other REITs and real estate companies, we believe it provides a meaningful supplemental measure of our operating performance because we believe that, by excluding the effects of the non-qualifying derivative contracts and the early lease surrender, management and investors are presented with an indicator of our operating performance that more closely achieves the objectives of the real estate industry in presenting FFO. Additionally, we believe the nature of these adjustments is non-recurring because there were not similar events during the two preceding years, and the events were not reasonably likely to recur and did not, in fact, recur within the succeeding two years. Neither FFO nor FFO as adjusted should be considered as alternatives to net income (determined in accordance with GAAP) as an indication of our performance. Neither FFO nor FFO as adjusted represents cash generated from operating activities determined in accordance with GAAP and is not a measure of liquidity or an indicator of our ability to make cash distributions. We believe that to further understand our performance, FFO and FFO as adjusted should be compared with our reported net income and considered in addition to cash flows in accordance with GAAP, as presented in our consolidated financial statements. 67 Table of Contents The following table presents a reconciliation of net income available to common shareholders to Funds from Operations for the years ended December 31, 2004, 2003, 2002, 2001, and 2000: Year ended December 31, 2004 2003 2002 2001 2000 (in thousands) Net income available to common shareholders $ 284,017 $ 365,322 $ 440,971 $ 201,440 $ 146,426 Add: Preferred dividend 3,412 6,592 6,572 Cumulative effect of a change in accounting principle, net of minority interest 6,767 Minority interest in Operating Partnership 68,174 73,784 72,900 68,634 70,003 Less: Gains on sales of real estate from discontinued operations, net of minority interest 27,338 73,234 25,345 Income from discontinued operations, net of minority interest 1,240 6,102 20,220 29,251 17,589 Gains on sales of land held for development, net of minority interest 3,633 2,584 Gains(losses) on sales of real estate and other assets, net of minority interest 8,149 57,574 186,810 6,505 (234 ) Income from unconsolidated joint ventures 3,380 6,016 7,954 4,186 1,758 Minority interests in property partnerships 4,685 1,827 2,408 1,409 (650 ) Income before minority interests in property partnerships, income from unconsolidated joint ventures, minority interest in Operating Partnership, gains(losses) on sales of real estate and other assets and land held for development, discontinued operations, cumulative effect of a change in accounting principle and preferred dividend 307,399 294,353 270,913 239,498 204,538 Add: Real estate depreciation and amortization (1) 257,319 216,235 192,574 153,550 134,386 Income from discontinued operations 1,703 7,766 25,006 36,334 23,808 Income from unconsolidated joint ventures 3,380 6,016 7,954 4,186 1,758 Loss from early extinguishment of debt associated with the sale of real estate (2) 1,474 2,386 433 Less: Minority interests in property partnerships share of funds from operations 922 3,458 3,223 2,322 1,061 Preferred dividends and distributions 15,050 21,249 28,711 33,312 32,994 Funds from operations 553,829 501,137 466,899 397,934 330,868 Add(subtract): Net derivative losses (SFAS No. 133) 1,038 11,874 26,488 Early surrender lease adjustment 8,520 (8,520 ) Funds from operations before net derivative losses (SFAS No. 133) and after early surrender lease adjustment $ 553,829 $ 502,175 $ 487,293 $ 415,902 $ 330,868 Less: Minority interest in Operating Partnership share of funds from operations 94,332 90,102 87,804 78,079 83,497 Funds from operations available to common shareholders before net derivative losses (SFAS No. 133) and after early surrender lease adjustment $ 459,497 $ 412,073 $ 399,489 $ 337,823 $ 247,371 Our percentage share of funds from operations basic 82.97 % 82.06 % 81.98 % 81.23 % 74.76 % Weighted average shares outstanding basic 106,458 96,900 93,145 90,002 71,424 (1) Real estate depreciation and amortization consists of depreciation and amortization from the Consolidated Statements of Operations of $252,256, $208,490, $178,163, $141,957 and $126,271, our share of unconsolidated joint venture real estate depreciation and amortization of $6,814, $8,475, $8,955, $5,410 and $3,015 and depreciation and amortization from discontinued operations of $685, $1,987, $8,265, $8,206 and $6,879, less corporate related depreciation and amortization of $2,436, $2,717, $2,809, $2,023 and $1,779 for the years ended December 31, 2004, 2003, 2002, 2001 and 2000, respectively. 68 Table of Contents (2) In accordance with SFAS No. 145, which was adopted on January 1, 2003 and reflected retroactively for all periods presented, we no longer classify losses from the extinguishments of debt as extraordinary items and therefore, under the NAREIT definition of FFO, we no longer add them to net income in calculating FFO. However, our reported FFO for the years ended December 31, 2002, 2001 and 2000 pre-dated the adoption of SFAS No. 145 and was calculated pursuant to the NAREIT definition based on accounting policies then in effect. Accordingly, we are presenting the reconciliation of FFO for such periods to net income available to common shareholders to include an adjustment for losses from the early extinguishments of debt for each period presented. 69 Table of Contents Reconciliation to Diluted Funds from Operations: For the years ended December 31, 2004 2003 2002 2001 2000 Income (Numerator) Shares/Units (Denominator) Income (Numerator) Shares/Units (Denominator) Income (Numerator) Shares/Units (Denominator) Income (Numerator) Shares/Units (Denominator) Income (Numerator) Shares/Units (Denominator) Basic funds from operations before net derivative losses and after early surrender lease adjustment $ 553,829 128,313 $ 502,175 118,087 $ 487,293 113,617 $ 415,904 110,803 $ 330,868 95,532 Effect of Dilutive Securities: Convertible Preferred Units 15,050 6,054 21,249 8,375 25,114 9,821 26,720 11,012 26,422 10,393 Convertible Preferred Stock 3,412 1,366 6,592 2,625 6,572 2,625 Stock Options and other 2,303 1,586 185 1,468 1,547 1,280 Diluted Funds from operations before net derivative losses and after early surrender lease adjustment $ 568,879 136,670 $ 523,424 128,048 $ 516,004 126,272 $ 449,216 125,987 $ 363,862 109,830 Less: Minority interest in Operating Partnership share of diluted funds from operations 90,970 21,854 86,608 21,187 83,659 20,473 74,170 20,802 79,868 24,107 Diluted Funds from operations available to common shareholders before net derivative losses and after early surrender lease adjustment (1) $ 477,909 114,816 $ 436,816 106,861 $ 432,345 105,799 $ 375,046 105,185 $ 283,994 85,723 (1) Our share of diluted funds from operations was 84.01%, 83.45%, 83.79%, 83.49% and 78.05% for the years ended December 31, 2004, 2003, 2002, 2001 and 2000, respectively. 70 Table of Contents Net Operating Income Net operating income, or NOI, is a non-GAAP financial measure equal to net income available to common shareholders, the most directly comparable GAAP financial measure, plus minority interest in Operating Partnership, net derivative losses, losses from early extinguishments of debt, losses on investments in securities, cumulative effect of a change in accounting principles, preferred dividends, depreciation and amortization, interest expense and general and administrative expense, less gains (losses) on sales of real estate from discontinued operations (net of minority interest), income from discontinued operations (net of minority interest), gains on sales of real estate and land held for development (net of minority interest), income from unconsolidated joint ventures, minority interests in property partnerships, interest and other income and development and management services income. We use NOI internally as a performance measure and believe NOI provides useful information to investors regarding our financial condition and results of operations because it reflects only those income and expense items that are incurred at the property level. Therefore, we believe NOI is a useful measure for evaluating the operating performance of our real estate assets. Our management also uses NOI to evaluate regional property level performance and to make decisions about resource allocations. Further, we believe NOI is useful to investors as a performance measure because, when compared across periods, NOI reflects the impact on operations from trends in occupancy rates, rental rates, operating costs and acquisition and development activity on an unleveraged basis, providing perspective not immediately apparent from net income. NOI excludes certain components from net income in order to provide results that are more closely related to a property results of operations. For example, interest expense is not necessarily linked to the operating performance of a real estate asset and is often incurred at the corporate level as opposed to the property level. In addition, depreciation and amortization, because of historical cost accounting and useful life estimates, may distort operating performance at the property level. NOI presented by us may not be comparable to NOI reported by other REITs that define NOI differently. We believe that in order to facilitate a clear understanding of our operating results, NOI should be examined in conjunction with net income as presented in our consolidated financial statements. NOI should not be considered as an alternative to net income as an indication of our performance or to cash flows as a measure of liquidity or ability to make distributions. The following sets forth a reconciliation of NOI to net income available to common shareholders for the fiscal years 2000 through 2004. Years ended December 31, 2004 2003 2002 2001 2000 Net operating income $ 894,888 $ 829,770 $ 761,740 $ 639,796 $ 551,406 Add: Development and management services 20,464 17,347 10,748 12,167 11,837 Interest and other 10,367 3,033 5,504 12,183 8,558 Minority interests in property partnerships 4,685 1,827 2,408 1,409 (650 ) Income from unconsolidated joint ventures 3,380 6,016 7,954 4,186 1,758 Gains(losses) on sales of real estate and other assets, net of minority interest 8,149 57,574 186,810 6,505 (234 ) Gains on sales of land held for development, net of minority interest 3,633 2,584 Income from discontinued operations, net of minority interest 1,240 6,102 20,220 29,251 17,589 Gains on sales of real estate from discontinued operations, net of minority interest 27,338 73,234 25,345 Less: General and administrative 53,636 45,359 47,292 38,312 35,659 Interest expense 306,170 299,436 263,067 211,391 204,900 Depreciation and amortization 252,256 208,490 178,163 141,957 126,271 Net derivative losses 1,038 11,874 26,488 Loss from early extinguishments of debt 6,258 1,474 2,386 433 Loss on investments in securities 4,297 6,500 Minority interest in Operating Partnership 68,174 73,784 72,900 68,634 70,003 Cumulative effect of a change in accounting principle, net of minority interest 6,767 Preferred dividend 3,412 6,592 6,572 Net income available to common shareholders $ 284,017 $ 365,322 $ 440,971 $ 201,440 $ 146,426 71 Table of Contents Contractual Obligations As of December 31, 2004, we were subject to certain contractual payment obligations as described in the table below.

We have various standing or renewable service contracts with vendors related to our property management. In addition, we have certain other utility contracts we enter into in the ordinary course of business which may extend beyond one year, which vary based on usage. These contracts include terms that provide for cancellation with insignificant or no cancellation penalties. Contract terms are generally one year or less. Off Balance Sheet Arrangements Joint Ventures We have investments in seven unconsolidated joint ventures (including our investment in the Value-Added Fund), six of which have mortgage indebtedness, with our effective ownership interests ranging from 23.89% to 51%. We exercise significant influence over, but do not control, these entities and therefore they are presently accounted for using the equity method of accounting. See also Note 5 to the Consolidated Financial Statements. At December 31, 2004, our share of the debt related to these investments was equal to approximately $196.5 million. The table below summarizes our share of the outstanding debt (based on our respective ownership interests) of these joint venture properties at December 31, 2004: Properties Interest Rate Principal Amount Maturity Date (in thousands) Metropolitan Square (51%) 8.23 % $ 68,358 May 1, 2010 Market Square North (50%) 7.70 % 46,984 December 19, 2011 901 New York Avenue (25%) 5.19 %(1) 42,500 January 1,2015 265 Franklin Street (35%) 3.54 %(2) 19,250 September 30, 2007 Worldgate Plaza (25%) 3.28 %(3) 14,250 October 1, 2007 Wisconsin Place (23.89%) 4.38 %(4) 5,134 January 1, 2008 Total 6.58 % $ 196,476 (1) We have agreed to guarantee up to $3.0 million of mortgage financing and our partner has pledged $9.0 million in a cash escrow account to further secure the loan on behalf of the entity. The amounts guaranteed and pledged are subject to decrease (and elimination) upon the satisfaction of certain operating performance and financial measures. 72 Table of Contents (2) The mortgage financing bears interest at a variable rate equal to LIBOR plus 1.10% per annum. At December 31, 2003, we had a guarantee obligation outstanding with a lender totaling approximately $1.4 million related to the re-tenanting of this property. In September 2004, the guarantee obligation was released upon the refinancing of the mortgage loan. (3) This property is owned by the Value-Added Fund. The mortgage financing bears interest at a variable rate equal to LIBOR plus 0.89% per annum and matures in October 2007, with two one-year extension options. In addition, the Value-Added Fund entered into an agreement to cap the interest rate at 9.5% for a nominal fee. (4) In accordance with EITF 98-1, the principal amount and interest rates shown were adjusted to reflect the fair value of the note. This loan is a seller financed non-interest bearing purchase money mortgage and the total weighted-average interest rates exclude the impact of this loan. The venture has agreed to guarantee the seller financing totaling $23.5 million on behalf of WP Project Developer LLC. Environmental Matters It is our policy to retain independent environmental consultants to conduct or update Phase I environmental assessments (which generally do not involve invasive techniques such as soil or ground water sampling) and asbestos surveys in connection with our acquisition of properties. These pre-purchase environmental assessments have not revealed environmental conditions that we believe will have a material adverse effect on our business, assets, financial condition, results of operations or liquidity, and we are not otherwise aware of environmental conditions with respect to our properties that we believe would have such a material adverse effect. However, from time to time environmental conditions at our properties have required and may in the future require environmental testing and/or regulatory filings, as well as remedial action. In February 1999, we (through a joint venture) acquired from Exxon Corporation a property in Massachusetts that was formerly used as a petroleum bulk storage and distribution facility and was known by the state regulatory authority to contain soil and groundwater contamination. We developed an office park on the property. We engaged a specially licensed environmental consultant to oversee the management of contaminated soil and groundwater that was disturbed in the course of construction. Under the property acquisition agreement, Exxon agreed to (1) bear the liability arising from releases or discharges of oil and hazardous substances which occurred at the site prior to our ownership, (2) continue monitoring and/or remediating such releases and discharges as necessary and appropriate to comply with applicable requirements, and (3) indemnify us for certain losses arising from preexisting site conditions. Any indemnity claim may be subject to various defenses, and there can be no assurance that the amounts paid under the indemnity, if any, would be sufficient to cover the liabilities arising from any such releases and discharges. Environmental investigations at two of our properties in Massachusetts have identified groundwater contamination migrating from off-site source properties. In both cases we engaged a specially licensed environmental consultant to perform the necessary investigations and assessments and to prepare submittals to the state regulatory authority, including Downgradient Property Status Opinions. The environmental consultant concluded that the properties qualify for Downgradient Property Status under the state regulatory program, which eliminates certain deadlines for conducting response actions at a site. We also believe that these properties qualify for liability relief under certain statutory amendments regarding upgradient releases. Although we believe that the current or former owners of the upgradient source properties may bear responsibility for some or all of the costs of addressing the identified groundwater contamination, we will take necessary further response actions (if any are required). Other than periodic testing, no such additional response actions are anticipated at this time. We own a property in Massachusetts where historic groundwater contamination was identified prior to acquisition. We engaged a specially licensed environmental consultant to perform investigations and to prepare necessary submittals to the state regulatory authority. The environmental consultant has concluded that (1) certain identified groundwater contaminants are migrating to the subject property from an off-site source property and (2) certain other detected contaminants are likely related to a historic release on the subject property. We have filed a Downgradient Property Status Opinion (described above) with respect to 73 Table of Contents contamination migrating from off-site and a Response Action Outcome ( RAO ) with respect to the identified historic release. The RAO indicates that regulatory closure has been achieved and that no further action is required at this time. Some of our properties and certain properties owned by our affiliates are located in urban, industrial and other previously developed areas where fill or current or historical uses of the areas have caused site contamination. Accordingly, it is sometimes necessary to institute special soil and/or groundwater handling procedures and/or include particular building design features in connection with development, construction and other property operations in order to achieve regulatory closure and/or ensure that contaminated materials are addressed in an appropriate manner. In these situations it is our practice to investigate the nature and extent of detected contamination and estimate the costs of required response actions and special handling procedures. We then use this information as part of our decision-making process with respect to the acquisition and/or development of the property. We own a parcel in Massachusetts, formerly used as a quarry/asphalt batching facility, which we may develop in the future. Pre-purchase testing indicated that the site contains relatively low levels of certain contaminants. We have engaged a specially licensed environmental consultant to monitor environmental conditions at the site and prepare necessary regulatory submittals based on the results of an environmental risk characterization. We anticipate that additional response actions necessary to achieve regulatory closure (if any) will be performed prior to or in connection with future development activities. When appropriate, closure documentation will be submitted for public review and comment pursuant to the state regulatory authority public information process. We expect that resolution of the environmental matters relating to the above will not have a material impact on our business, assets, financial condition, results of operations or liquidity. However, we cannot assure you that we have identified all environmental liabilities at our properties, that all necessary remediation actions have been or will be undertaken at our properties or that we will be indemnified, in full or at all, in the event that such environmental liabilities arise. Newly Issued Accounting Standards In January 2003, the Financial Accounting Standards Board ( FASB ) issued FASB Interpretation No. 46, Consolidation of Variable Interest Entities ( FIN 46 ). In December 2003, the FASB issued FIN 46R, Consolidation of Variable Interest Entities, which amended FIN 46. FIN 46R was effective immediately for arrangements entered into after January 31, 2003, and became effective during the first quarter of 2004 for all arrangements entered into before February 1, 2003. FIN 46R requires existing unconsolidated Variable Interest Entities, ( VIEs ) to be consolidated by their primary beneficiaries. The primary beneficiary of a VIE is the party that absorbs a majority of the entity expected losses or receives a majority of its expected residual returns, or both, as a result of holding variable interests, which are the ownership interests, contractual interests, or other pecuniary interests in an entity that change with changes in the fair value of the entity net assets excluding variable interests. Prior to FIN 46R, we included an entity in our consolidated financial statements only if we controlled the entity through voting interests. The adoption and application of FIN 46 and FIN 46R has not had a material impact on our consolidated financial statements. In March 2004, the Emerging Issues Task Force reached a final consensus regarding Issue 03-6, Participating Securities and the Two-Class Method under FAS 128. The issue addresses a number of questions regarding the computation of earnings per share by companies that have issued securities other than common stock that participate in dividends and earnings of the issuing entity. Such securities are contractually entitled to receive dividends when and if the entity declares dividends on common stock. The issue also provides further guidance on applying the two-class method of calculating earnings per share once it is determined that a security is participating. The two-class method is an earnings allocation formula that determines earnings per share for each class of common stock and participating security according to dividends declared (or accumulated) and participation rights in undistributed earnings. This consensus was effective for the period ended June 30, 2004 and was applied by restating previously reported earnings per share. We have adopted the provisions of EITF 03-6, and have determined that our Series A Preferred Stock and the Series Two and Three Preferred Units of 74 Table of Contents our Operating Partnership constitute participating securities. The adoption of EITF 03-6 has resulted in a reduction of our earnings per share for those periods in which we and the Operating Partnership had undistributed earnings. Undistributed earnings were allocated to our Series A Preferred Stock and the Series Two and Three Preferred Units based on their contractual rights to share in those earnings as if all the earnings for the period had been distributed. In December 2004, the FASB issued SFAS No. 123R, Share-Based Compensation ( SFAS No. 123R ). SFAS No. 123R replaces SFAS No. 123, Accounting for Stock Issued to Employees. SFAS No. 123R requires the compensation cost relating to share-based payment transactions be recognized in financial statements and be measured based on the fair value of the equity instrument issued. SFAS No. 123R is effective in fiscal periods beginning after June 15, 2005. Our outstanding stock options became vested on January 17, 2005 and we do not expect to have significant unvested stock option awards in future periods. As a result, we do not expect the adoption of SFAS No. 123R to have a material impact on our results of operations, financial position, or liquidity. In December 2004, the FASB issued SFAS No. 153, Exchange of Nonmonetary Assets, an amendment of APB Opinion No. 29 ( SFAS No. 153 ). The amendments made by SFAS No. 153 are based on the principle that exchanges of nonmonetary assets should be measured on the fair value of assets exchanged. SFAS No. 153 eliminates the exception for nonmonetary exchanges of similar productive assets and replaces it with a broader exception for exchanges of nonmonetary assets that do not have commercial substance. SFAS No. 153 is effective for nonmonetary exchanges occurring in fiscal periods beginning after June 15, 2005. We do not expect the adoption of SFAS No. 153 to have a material impact on our results of operations, financial position, or liquidity. Inflation Substantially all of our leases provide for separate real estate tax and operating expense escalations over a base amount. In addition, many of our leases provide for fixed base rent increases or indexed increases. We believe that inflationary increases in costs may be at least partially offset by the contractual rent increases described above.
