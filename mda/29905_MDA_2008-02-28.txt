Item 7. Management Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operation Special Note Regarding Forward-Looking Statements This Annual Report on Form 10-K, especially this Item 7, contains forward-looking statements within the meaning of applicable law. Forward-looking statements are subject to inherent uncertainties and risks. It is important that you read SPECIAL NOTES REGARDING FORWARD-LOOKING STATEMENTS inside the front cover of this Annual Report on Form 10-K for more information about these forward-looking statements and their inherent uncertainties and risks. (1) FINANCIAL CONDITION Liquidity and Capital Resources Management assesses the Company liquidity in terms of its ability to generate cash to fund its operating, investing and financing activities. Significant factors affecting liquidity are: cash flows generated from operating activities, capital expenditures, acquisitions, dispositions, dividends, repurchases of outstanding shares, adequacy of available commercial paper and bank lines of credit, and the ability to attract long-term capital with satisfactory terms. The Company generates substantial cash from operations and remains in a strong financial position, with sufficient liquidity available for reinvestment in existing businesses and strategic acquisitions while managing its capital structure on a short and long-term basis. The following table is derived from the Consolidated Statements of Cash Flows: Years Ended December 31, Cash Flows from Continuing Operations 2007 2006 (In thousands) Net Cash Flows Provided By (Used In): Operating activities $ 901,941 $ 866,082 Investing activities (332,411 ) (842,600 ) Financing activities (345,673 ) 128,290 Cash flows provided by operating activities during 2007 increased $35.9 million over the prior year primarily reflecting higher earnings from continuing operations before depreciation and amortization partially offset by higher incentive compensation, interest and tax payments. Cash used in investing activities during 2007 decreased $510.2 million compared to 2006, reflecting lower acquisition spending and capital expenditures, partially offset by lower proceeds from the disposition of businesses during 2007 compared to 2006. Acquisition expenditures in 2007 were $273.6 million compared to $1,116.8 million in 2006, while proceeds from the disposition of businesses were $91.0 million, down $354.9 million from $445.9 million in 2006. Capital expenditures of $174.3 million decreased from $190.7 million in the prior year, and primarily funded investments in plant expansions, plant machinery and information systems. The Company currently anticipates that any acquisitions made during 2008 will be funded from available cash and internally generated funds and, if necessary, through the issuance of commercial paper, established lines of credit or public debt markets. Capital expenditures for 2008 are generally expected to be at or below 2007 levels. Cash used in financing activities during 2007 totaled $345.7 million compared to cash provided by financing activities of $128.3 million in the 2006 period. The change in financing activity during 2007 primarily reflected cash used to purchase 12.4 million shares of Dover common stock on the open market, under its share repurchase program, throughout 2007 for a total of $591 million. A portion of these shares were acquired through an accelerated share repurchase agreement ( ASR ) under which the Company, during the third quarter of 2007, purchased 6 million shares of its common stock at an initial purchase price of $51.64 per share. Upon settlement of this ASR in the fourth quarter of 2007, the final economic purchase price was $48.36 per share, representing an average of the volume weighted average price of the Company common stock during the outstanding period less a negotiated discount amount. The 2007 share repurchases were funded through cash from operations, proceeds from the disposition of businesses and an increase in outstanding commercial paper borrowings. 16 Table of Contents Adjusted working capital (a non-GAAP measure calculated as accounts receivable, plus inventory, less accounts payable) increased from the prior year end by $29.1 million, or 2%, to $1,363.0 million which reflected an increase in receivables of $57.4 million, a decrease in inventory of $13.0 million and an increase in accounts payable of $15.3 million. Excluding acquisitions and the effects of foreign exchange translation, adjusted working capital would have decreased by $50.1 million, or 4%. Average annual adjusted working capital as a percentage of revenue (a non-GAAP measure calculated as the five-quarter average balance of accounts receivable, plus inventory, less accounts payable divided by the trailing twelve months of revenue) increased slightly to 19.2% at December 31, 2007 from 19.0% at December 31, 2006. In addition to measuring its cash flow generation and usage based upon the operating, investing and financing classifications included in the Consolidated Statements of Cash Flows, the Company also measures free cash flow (a non-GAAP measure). Management believes that free cash flow is an important measure of operating performance because it provides both management and investors a measurement of cash generated from operations that is available to fund acquisitions, pay dividends, repay debt and repurchase Dover common stock. For further information, see Non-GAAP Disclosures at the end of this Item 7. Free cash flow for the year ended December 31, 2007 was $727.7 million or 10.1% of revenue compared to $675.4 million or 10.7% of revenue in the prior year. The 2007 increase in free cash flow reflected higher earnings from continuing operations before depreciation and amortization and lower capital expenditures, partially offset by higher tax payments in 2007. The following table is a reconciliation of free cash flow to cash flows from operating activities: Years Ended December 31, Free Cash Flow 2007 2006 (In thousands) Cash flow provided by operating activities $ 901,941 $ 866,082 Less: Capital expenditures 174,252 190,732 Free cash flow $ 727,689 $ 675,350 Free cash flow as a percentage of revenue 10.1 % 10.7 % At December 31, 2007, the Company net property, plant, and equipment totaled $885.1 million compared to $815.2 million at the end of 2006. The increase in net property, plant and equipment reflected capital expenditures of $174.3 million, acquisitions of $27.0 million and $25.0 million related to foreign currency fluctuations, partially offset by depreciation and disposals. The aggregate of current and deferred income tax assets and liabilities decreased from a $268.5 million net liability at the beginning of the year to a net liability of $238.6 million at year-end 2007. This resulted primarily from an increase in deferred tax assets arising from accrued expenses, principally for state income taxes, and a decrease in deferred tax liabilities related to intangible assets. Dover consolidated benefit obligation related to defined and supplemental retirement benefits decreased by $31.0 million in 2007. The decrease was due primarily to actuarial gains, benefits paid and plan amendments, offset by benefits earned, interest cost and currency rate changes. In 2007, plan assets increased $18.8 million primarily due to gains on plan investments during the year and company contributions, partially offset by benefits paid. It is estimated that the Company defined and supplemental retirement benefits expense will decrease from $49.5 million in 2007 to approximately $38.3 million in 2008. The Company utilizes the net debt to total capitalization calculation (a non-GAAP measure) to assess its overall financial leverage and capacity and believes the calculation is useful to investors for the same reason. The 17 Table of Contents following table provides a reconciliation of net debt to total capitalization to the most directly comparable GAAP measures: At December 31, At December 31, Net Debt to Total Capitalization Ratio 2007 2006 (In thousands) Current maturities of long-term debt $ 33,175 $ 32,267 Commercial paper and other short-term debt 605,474 258,282 Long-term debt 1,452,003 1,480,491 Total debt 2,090,652 1,771,040 Less: Cash and cash equivalents 602,412 374,845 Net debt 1,488,240 1,396,195 Add: Stockholders equity 3,946,173 3,811,022 Total capitalization $ 5,434,413 $ 5,207,217 Net debt to total capitalization 27.4 % 26.8 % The total debt level of $2,090.7 million at December 31, 2007 increased $319.6 million from December 31, 2006 due to increased commercial paper borrowings used to fund the Company ASR program and other open market purchases of its common stock. Net debt at December 31, 2007 increased $92 million as a result of the total debt increase, partially offset by an increase in cash generated from operations. The percentage increase in net debt to total capital, after $591 million of share repurchases, reflects strong operational free cash flow and proceeds from dispositions of $91 million. Dover long-term debt instruments had a book value of $1,485.2 million on December 31, 2007 and a fair value of approximately $1,496.0 million. On December 31, 2006, the Company long-term debt instruments had a book value of $1,512.8 million and a fair value of approximately $1,502.9 million. The Company believes that existing sources of liquidity are adequate to meet anticipated funding needs at comparable risk-based interest rates for the foreseeable future. Acquisition spending and/or share repurchases could potentially increase Company debt. However, management anticipates that the net debt to total capitalization ratio will remain generally consistent with historical levels. Operating cash flow and access to capital markets are expected to satisfy the Company various cash flow requirements, including acquisitions and capital expenditures. Management is not aware of any potential impairment to the Company liquidity, and the Company is in compliance with all of its long-term debt covenants. It is anticipated that in 2008 any funding requirements above cash generated from operations will be met through the issuance of commercial paper and, depending upon market conditions, through the issuance of long-term debt. As of December 31, 2007, there were two interest rate swap agreements outstanding for a total notional amount of $100.0 million designated as fair value hedges on part of the Company $400.0 million 6.50% Notes due on February 15, 2011. One $50 million interest rate swap exchanges fixed-rate interest for variable-rate interest. The other $50 million swap is designated in foreign currency and exchanges fixed-rate interest for variable-rate interest, and also hedges a portion of the Company net investment in international operations. The swap agreements have reduced the effective interest rate on the notes to 6.43%. There is no hedge ineffectiveness, and the fair value of the interest rate swaps outstanding as of December 31, 2007 was determined through market quotation. 18 Table of Contents At December 31, 2007, the Company had open foreign exchange forward purchase contracts expiring through February 2008 related to fair value hedges of foreign currency exposures as follows: Currencies Sold U.S. Average Average Swiss Franc Average Dollar Contract Euro Contract Dollar Contract Currencies Purchased Value Rate Value Rate Value Rate (In thousands) Euro $ 18,000 1.6379 Swiss Franc 11,000 0.8812 4,000 0.6038 The Company credit ratings, which are independently developed by the respective rating agencies, are as follows for the years ended December 31: 2007 2006 Short term Long term Short term Long term Moody P-1 A2 P-1 A2 Standard & Poor A-1 A A-1 A Fitch F1 A F1 A Contractual Obligations Table A summary of the Company undiscounted long-term debt, commitments and obligations as of December 31, 2007 and the years when these obligations are expected to be due is as follows: Payments Due by Period Less than 1 More than Total Year 1-3 Years 3-5 Years 5 Years Other(A) (In thousands) Long-term debt $ 1,485,178 $183,175 (B) $ 73,904 $ 434,372 $ 793,727 $ Interest expense 905,424 73,966 140,120 91,370 599,968 Rental commitments 185,561 45,493 61,100 34,007 44,961 Purchase obligations 19,937 19,327 610 Capital leases 15,921 2,300 3,232 2,573 7,816 Supplemental & post- retirement benefits 174,000 9,000 46,000 29,000 90,000 Uncertain tax positions(A) 238,168 19,751 218,417 Other long-term obligations 4,054 917 1,321 868 948 Total obligations $ 3,028,243 $353,929 $ 326,287 $ 592,190 $ 1,537,420 $ 218,417 (A) Due to the uncertainty of the potential settlement of future uncertain tax positions, management is unable to estimate the timing of the related payments, if any, that will be made subsequent to 2008. These amounts do not include the potential indirect benefits resulting from deductions or credits for payments made to other jurisdictions. (B) Includes $150 million Note due June 2008, which the Company has the intent and ability to refinance for a period of greater than one year. Severance and Exit Reserves From time to time, the Company will initiate various restructuring programs at its operating companies or record severance and exit costs in connection with purchase accounting for acquisitions. At December 31, 2007 and 2006, the Company had reserves related to severance and exit activities of $28.4 million and $23.3 million, respectively. During 2007, the Company recorded $12.8 million in purchase accounting reserves related to acquisitions, made $9.7 million in payments and recorded additional charges of $1.9 million. 19 Table of Contents (2) RESULTS OF OPERATIONS: 2007 COMPARED TO 2006 Consolidated Results of Operations Revenue for the year ended December 31, 2007 increased 14% over 2006, due to increases of $473.1 million at Engineered Systems, $294.8 million at Industrial Products and $152.4 million at Fluid Management. These revenue increases were due to positive market fundamentals and acquisitions, while Electronic Technologies revenue decreased $21.5 million due to weakness in its markets. Overall, Dover organic revenue growth was 2.3%, acquisition growth was 9.7% and the impact from foreign exchange was 2.1%. Gross profit increased 14% to $2,621.7 million from 2006 while the gross profit margin remained essentially flat at 36.3% and 36.5%, respectively. Selling and administrative expenses of $1,641.0 million for the year ended December 31, 2007 increased $230.3 million over the comparable 2006 period, primarily due to increased revenue activity and increases in compensation and pension benefit costs. Interest expense, net, increased 16% to $89.0 million for 2007, compared to $77.0 million for 2006 due to higher average outstanding borrowings used to fund purchases of the Company common stock and average commercial paper rates. Other expense (income), net for 2007 and 2006 of $4.1 million and $11.4 million, respectively, was driven primarily by foreign exchange losses, partially offset by other miscellaneous income. The 2007 and 2006 tax rates for continuing operations were 26.4%, and 26.8%, respectively. Both periods were favorably impacted by the mix of non-U.S. earnings in low-taxed overseas jurisdictions. Earnings from continuing operations for 2007 were $653.3 million or $3.22 per diluted share compared to $592.5 million or $2.88 per diluted share in 2006. For 2007, net earnings were $661.1 million, or $3.26 per diluted share, which included $7.8 million, or $0.04 per diluted share, of income from discontinued operations, compared to $561.8 million, or $2.73 per diluted share for 2006, which included a $30.7 million, or $0.15 per diluted share, loss from discontinued operations. Refer to Note 8 in the Consolidated Financial Statements for additional information on discontinued operations. 20 Table of Contents Segment Results of Operations Industrial Products Twelve Months Ended December 31, 2007 2006 % Change (In thousands) Revenue Material Handling $ 959,112 $ 706,499 36 % Mobile Equipment 1,262,984 1,220,718 3 % Eliminations (977 ) (928 ) $ 2,221,119 $ 1,926,289 15 % Segment earnings $ 297,051 $ 251,228 18 % Operating margin 13.4 % 13.0 % Acquisition related depreciation and amortization expense* $ 26,709 $ 25,213 6 % Bookings Material Handling $ 961,047 $ 712,570 35 % Mobile Equipment 1,364,340 1,251,096 9 % Eliminations (1,556 ) (2,799 ) $ 2,323,831 $ 1,960,867 19 % Backlog Material Handling $ 149,628 $ 146,614 2 % Mobile Equipment 543,776 429,191 27 % Eliminations (195 ) (165 ) $ 693,209 $ 575,640 20 % * Represents the pre-tax impact on earnings from the depreciation and amortization of acquisition accounting write-ups to reflect the fair value of inventory, property, plant and equipment, and intangible assets. Industrial Products revenue and earnings increases over the prior year were primarily the result of the acquisition of Paladin in August 2006 and the July 2007 acquisition of Hanmecson International, a Chinese manufacturer of vehicle lifts. For the year, the segment achieved 2% organic growth, while growth from acquisitions and the impact of foreign exchange accounted for 12% and 1%, respectively. Material Handling revenue increased 36% while earnings increased 28% compared to the prior year. The increases were primarily due to the Paladin acquisition and improvements in the heavy winch, recreational vehicle and industrial automation businesses. Margin was impacted by the slowdown in the heavy construction business producing attachments and cylinders. In addition, the platform benefited from new product introductions, plant rationalization and global sourcing during 2007. Mobile Equipment revenue and earnings increased 3% and 8%, respectively, over the prior year. The platform results benefited from the Hanmecson acquisition and core growth at businesses in the petroleum, crude oil and military markets, as well as a $5.3 million net pre-tax gain on the sale of a facility in the second quarter of 2007. However, softness experienced in the automotive service industry and the aerospace service business partially offset these gains. 21 Table of Contents Engineered Systems Twelve Months Ended December 31, 2007 2006 % Change (In thousands) Revenue Engineered Products $ 1,234,709 $ 1,105,862 12 % Product Identification 912,580 568,301 61 % $ 2,147,289 $ 1,674,163 28 % Segment earnings $ 281,817 $ 241,730 17 % Operating margin 13.1 % 14.4 % Acquisition related depreciation and amortization expense* $ 31,253 $ 14,636 114 % Bookings Engineered Products $ 1,209,452 $ 1,167,765 4 % Product Identification 919,216 562,096 64 % $ 2,128,668 $ 1,729,861 23 % Backlog Engineered Products $ 230,796 $ 256,200 (10 )% Product Identification 68,938 57,706 19 % $ 299,734 $ 313,906 (5 )% * Represents the pre-tax impact on earnings from the depreciation and amortization of acquisition accounting write-ups to reflect the fair value of inventory, property, plant and equipment, and intangible assets. Engineered Systems revenue and earnings increases over the prior year reflect the December 2006 acquisition of Markem and the May 2006 acquisition of O Neil. Revenue growth due to acquisitions was 19%. However, most core businesses also improved as the segment achieved organic revenue growth of 7%, with the remainder due to the impact of foreign exchange. The decrease in operating margin was due to weakness in the ATM business. Engineered Products revenue and earnings increased 12% and 5%, respectively, over the prior year due to strong supermarket and heat exchanger markets; offset by weakness in the ATM business which negatively impacted the revenue and earnings increases. Sequentially, revenue and earnings in the fourth quarter of 2007 were down 8% and 19%, respectively, reflecting normal seasonality and a slowdown in retail food equipment demand, along with reduced orders tied to high customer inventory levels in the heat exchanger business. The Product Identification platform had revenue and earnings increases of 61% and 41%, respectively, during 2007 mostly reflecting the 2006 acquisitions of Markem and O Neil. Overall, the revenue growth due to the 2006 acquisitions was 55%, while organic growth was 3% due to growth in the core direct coding business with the remainder due to foreign exchange. 22 Table of Contents Fluid Management Twelve Months Ended December 31, 2007 2006 % Change (In thousands) Revenue Energy $ 775,024 $ 684,178 13 % Fluid Solutions 707,113 645,399 10 % Eliminations (129 ) 26 $ 1,482,008 $ 1,329,603 11 % Segment earnings $ 304,576 $ 267,377 14 % Operating margin 20.6 % 20.1 % Acquisition related depreciation and amortization expense* $ 15,569 $ 16,183 (4 )% Bookings Energy $ 785,065 $ 693,927 13 % Fluid Solutions 716,644 653,932 10 % Eliminations (110 ) (83 ) $ 1,501,599 $ 1,347,776 11 % Backlog Energy $ 88,245 $ 75,449 17 % Fluid Solutions 73,713 63,565 16 % Eliminations (14 ) (33 ) $ 161,944 $ 138,981 17 % * Represents the pre-tax impact on earnings from the depreciation and amortization of acquisition accounting write-ups to reflect the fair value of inventory, property, plant and equipment, and intangible assets. Fluid Management revenue and earnings increases were the result of strength at all businesses in the segment. The segment continued to benefit from strong results from the Energy platform which serves the oil, gas and power generation markets. As a result, the segment achieved organic growth of 9%, with the remainder primarily from foreign exchange. The Energy platform revenue and earnings increased 13% and 15%, respectively, primarily due to strong oil and gas markets and increased power generation demand throughout 2007. The platform earnings growth further benefited from higher volume, productivity gains and operational improvements. Fluid Solutions revenue and earnings both increased 10% when compared to the prior year due to improvements at all core businesses in the platform. Throughout 2007, the platform experienced strong demand in the chemical and rail markets. Overall, the platform had organic revenue growth of 6%, growth from acquisitions of 2%, with the reminder due to foreign exchange. 23 Table of Contents Electronic Technologies Twelve Months Ended December 31, 2007 2006 % Change (In thousands) Revenue $ 1,390,103 $ 1,411,564 (2 )% Segment earnings $ 180,337 $ 214,947 (16 )% Operating margin 13.0 % 15.2 % Acquisition related depreciation and amortization expense* $ 38,296 $ 32,914 16 % Bookings 1,378,551 1,410,043 (2 )% Backlog 232,704 200,048 16 % * Represents the pre-tax impact on earnings from the depreciation and amortization of acquisition accounting write-ups to reflect the fair value of inventory, property, plant and equipment, and intangible assets. Electronic Technologies year-over-year decreases in revenue and earnings were primarily due to softness in the semi-conductor end markets throughout 2007 compared to strong markets experienced in the prior year. The medical and military/space markets were strong throughout the year, while telecom markets remained flat. Overall, the increase in revenue due to acquisitions and foreign exchange were each 3%, while organic revenue decreased 8%. 2006 COMPARED TO 2005 Consolidated Results of Operations Revenue for the year ended December 31, 2006 increased 23% over 2005 due to increases at all four segments led by increases of $470.1 million at Electronic Technologies and $269.4 million at Engineered Systems. The Electronic Technologies and Engineered Systems revenue increased due to acquisitions and strong organic growth. Overall, Dover organic revenue growth was 14%, acquisition growth was 9% and the impact from foreign exchange was negligible. Gross profit increased 26% to $2,308.6 million while the gross profit margin increased 80 basis points to 36.5%. Selling and administrative expenses of $1,410.7 million for the year ended December 31, 2006 increased $227.0 million over the comparable 2005 period, primarily due to increased revenue activity and $26.1 million of equity compensation expense related to the adoption of Statement of Financial Accounting Standard 123(R), Share Based Payment ( SFAS No. 123(R) ), which requires companies to expense the fair value of equity compensation, such as stock options and stock appreciation rights ( SARs ), primarily over the related vesting period. The Company used the modified prospective method to adopt SFAS No. 123(R), which did not require the restatement of prior periods. Selling and administrative expenses as a percentage of revenue decreased to 22.3% from 23.1% in 2005. Excluding the effect of SFAS No. 123(R), selling and administrative expenses during the year ended December 31, 2006 would have been $1,384.6 million or 21.9% of revenue. Interest expense, net, increased 7% to $77.0 million for 2006, compared to $72.2 million for 2005 due to higher average outstanding borrowings and average commercial paper rates. Other expense (income), net for 2006 of $11.4 million was driven primarily by foreign exchange losses. Other expense (income), net of ($12.7) million for 2005 included foreign exchange gains of $7.8 million. The 2006 tax rate for continuing operations was 26.8%, reflecting the effect of the full year retroactive extension of the U.S. federal research credit, a favorable mix of non-U.S. earnings in low-taxed overseas jurisdictions, a lower relative U.S. federal tax exclusion for non-U.S. sales in 2006 and the inclusion of a $7.8 million net benefit primarily related to the resolution of a state income tax issue. The 2005 tax rate for continuing operations of 26.5% included a $9.5 million provision related to the repatriation of $373.7 million of dividends and a $25.5 million benefit primarily related to the resolution of U.S. tax issues and a $5.5 million benefit related to a favorable federal tax court decision. Excluding the repatriation provision, the full year 2005 tax rate for continuing operations was 24.9%. 24 Table of Contents Earnings from continuing operations for 2006 were $592.5 million or $2.88 per diluted share, compared to $432.5 million or $2.12 per diluted share in 2005. For 2006, net earnings were $561.8 million, or $2.73 diluted share, which included a $30.7 million, or $0.15 per diluted share, loss from discontinued operations, compared to $510.1 million, or $2.50 per diluted share for 2005, which included $77.6 million, or $0.38 per diluted share, in earnings from discontinued operations. Refer to Note 8 in the Consolidated Financial Statements for additional information on discontinued operations.

Industrial Products revenue and earnings increased over the prior year as a result of the August 2006 acquisition of Paladin and strength in the energy, military and commercial transportation markets as well as in the heavy winch business. Margin declined due to purchase accounting amortization related to the Paladin acquisition. Overall, the segment had organic revenue growth of 5% during the year, with the remainder primarily from acquisitions. Material Handling revenue increased primarily due to the Paladin acquisition and continued growth in the heavy winch business, partially offset by softness in the automotive and recreational vehicle markets. Earnings increased 12% as the margin was impacted by the weak automotive, light construction and recreational vehicle markets. Mobile Equipment revenue increased reflecting strength in the commercial transportation market. However, these improvements were negatively impacted by weakness in the North American automotive service industry. 25 Table of Contents Earnings increased 11% driven by volume and improved leverage. In addition, prior year earnings were positively impacted by a gain of approximately $1 million on the sale of a facility.

Engineered Systems revenue and earnings increases over the prior year reflect the relative strength of the segment markets during 2006. The slight decrease in operating margin was due to higher costs in the Engineered Products platform. The segment achieved organic growth of 14% with the remainder primarily from acquisitions. Engineered Products revenue and earnings increased 19% and 17%, respectively, over the prior year due to the robust heat exchanger market and positive demand for supermarket, foodservice, can necking, and packaging closure equipment. These improvements were partially offset by weakness in the ATM business. The platform margins were impacted by increased commodity costs and temporary cost inefficiencies related to higher production levels in the food equipment business. Product Identification revenue increased 21% and earnings increased 37% over the prior year, reflecting successful results from all product lines and regions as well as the impact of the Markem and O Neil acquisitions which contributed 12% to the group revenue growth for the year. 26 Table of Contents Fluid Management Twelve Months Ended December 31, 2006 2005 % Change (In thousands) Revenue Energy $ 684,178 $ 506,844 35 % Fluid Solutions 645,399 561,236 15 % Eliminations 26 (32 ) $ 1,329,603 $ 1,068,048 24 % Segment earnings $ 267,377 $ 198,344 35 % Operating margin 20.1 % 18.6 % Acquisition related depreciation and amortization expense* $ 16,183 $ 14,593 11 % Bookings Energy $ 693,927 $ 535,022 30 % Fluid Solutions 653,932 566,350 15 % Eliminations (83 ) (197 ) $ 1,347,776 $ 1,101,175 22 % Backlog Energy $ 75,449 $ 58,348 29 % Fluid Solutions 63,565 53,218 19 % Eliminations (33 ) (6 ) $ 138,981 $ 111,560 25 % * Represents the pre-tax impact on earnings from the depreciation and amortization of acquisition accounting write-ups to reflect the fair value of inventory, property, plant and equipment, and intangible assets. Fluid Management revenue, earnings and bookings increased primarily as a result of improvements in the Energy platform and the third quarter 2005 acquisition of Colder Products. Strong results in the Energy platform contributed to the margin increase, partially offset by slightly weaker margins in the Fluid Solutions platform. Overall, the segment had organic revenue growth of 19% during the year with the remainder primarily from acquisitions. The Energy platform delivered strong results throughout 2006 with revenue and earnings increases of 35% and 50%, respectively, over the prior year. Commodity pricing for oil and gas began moderating in the second quarter of 2006; however, strong activity in exploration, production and drilling continued to drive the positive 2006 results. The group continued to add capacity judiciously to meet increasing levels of demand. Fluid Solutions revenue and earnings increased 15% and 12%, respectively, due to improvements in mobile transport equipment, global demand for retail petroleum equipment and support equipment for the growing ethanol business and the acquisition of Colder Products. Product mix had a negative impact on earnings. 27 Table of Contents Electronic Technologies Twelve Months Ended December 31, 2006 2005 % Change (In thousands) Revenue $ 1,411,564 $ 941,416 50 % Segment earnings $ 214,947 $ 88,022 144 % Operating margin 15.2 % 9.3 % Acquisition related depreciation and amortization expense* $ 32,914 $ 24,931 32 % Bookings 1,410,043 986,633 43 % Backlog 200,048 189,133 6 % * Represents the pre-tax impact on earnings from the depreciation and amortization of acquisition accounting write-ups to reflect the fair value of inventory, property, plant and equipment, and intangible assets. The increases in revenue and earnings in the Electronic Technologies segment compared to the prior year were due to the third quarter 2005 acquisition of Knowles Electronics and organic growth of 26% for the year. Although the semiconductor market moderated in the fourth quarter of 2006, the segment continued to exhibit strong fundamentals based on levels of recurring revenue and the overall strength of the consumer electronics industry. In addition, the core components business showed strength in the frequency control and micro acoustics markets. Critical Accounting Policies The Company consolidated financial statements and related public financial information are based on the application of generally accepted accounting principles in the United States of America ( GAAP ). GAAP requires the use of estimates, assumptions, judgments and subjective interpretations of accounting principles that have an impact on the assets, liabilities, revenue and expense amounts reported. These estimates can also affect supplemental information contained in the public disclosures of the Company, including information regarding contingencies, risk and its financial condition. The Company believes its use of estimates and underlying accounting assumptions conform to GAAP and are consistently applied. Valuations based on estimates are reviewed for reasonableness on a consistent basis throughout the Company. Primary areas where the financial information of Dover is subject to the use of estimates, assumptions and the application of judgment include the following areas: Revenue is recognized when all of the following circumstances are satisfied: a) persuasive evidence of an arrangement exists, b) price is fixed or determinable, c) collectability is reasonably assured, and d) delivery has occurred. In revenue transactions where installation is required, revenue can be recognized when the installation obligation is not essential to the functionality of the delivered products. Revenue transactions involving non-essential installation obligations are those which can generally be completed in a short period of time at insignificant cost and the skills required to complete these installations are not unique to the Company and in many cases can be provided by third parties or the customers. If the installation obligation is essential to the functionality of the delivered product, revenue recognition is deferred until installation is complete. In addition, when it is determined that there are multiple deliverables to a sales arrangement, the Company will allocate consideration received to the separate deliverables based on their relative fair values and recognize revenue based on the appropriate criteria for each deliverable identified. In a limited number of revenue transactions, other post shipment obligations such as training and customer acceptance are required and, accordingly, revenue recognition is deferred until the customer is obligated to pay, or acceptance has been confirmed. Service revenue is recognized and earned when services are performed. Allowances for doubtful accounts are estimated at the individual operating companies based on estimates of losses related to customer receivable balances. Estimates are developed by using standard quantitative measures based on historical losses, adjusting for current economic conditions and, in some cases, evaluating specific customer accounts for risk of loss. The establishment of reserves requires the use of judgment and assumptions regarding the potential for losses on receivable balances. Due to the fact that Dover operates in many different markets, changes in economic conditions in specific markets generally should not have a material effect on reserve balances required. 28 Table of Contents Inventory for the majority of the Company subsidiaries, including all international subsidiaries are stated at the lower of cost, determined on the first-in, first-out (FIFO) basis, or market. Other domestic inventory is stated at cost, determined on the last-in, first-out (LIFO) basis, which is less than market value. Under certain market conditions, estimates and judgments regarding the valuation of inventory are employed by the Company to properly value inventory. The Electronic Technologies companies tend to experience higher levels of inventory value fluctuations, particularly given the relatively high rate of product obsolescence over relatively short periods of time. Occasionally, the Company will establish restructuring reserves at an operation in accordance with appropriate accounting principles. These reserves, for both severance and exit costs, require the use of estimates. Though Dover believes that these estimates accurately reflect the anticipated costs, actual results may be different than the estimated amounts. Dover has significant tangible and intangible assets on its balance sheet that include goodwill and other intangibles related to acquisitions. The valuation and classification of these assets and the assignment of useful depreciation and amortization lives involve significant judgments and the use of estimates. The testing of these intangibles under established accounting guidelines (including SFAS No. 142) for impairment also requires significant use of judgment and assumptions, particularly as it relates to the identification of reporting units and the determination of fair market value. Dover assets and reporting units are tested and reviewed for impairment on an annual basis during the fourth quarter or when indicators of impairment exist. The Company believes that its use of estimates and assumptions are reasonable and comply with generally accepted accounting principles. Changes in business conditions could potentially require adjustments to the valuations. The valuation of Dover pension and other post-retirement plans requires the use of assumptions and estimates that are used to develop actuarial valuations of expenses and assets/liabilities. These assumptions include discount rates, investment returns, projected salary increases and benefits, and mortality rates. The actuarial assumptions used in Dover pension reporting are reviewed annually and are compared with external benchmarks to assure that they accurately account for Dover future pension obligations. Changes in assumptions and future investment returns could potentially have a material impact on Dover pension expenses and related funding requirements. Dover expected long-term rate of return on plan assets is reviewed annually based on actual returns, economic trends and portfolio allocation. Dover discount rate assumption is determined by constructing a portfolio of bonds to match the expected benefit stream to be paid from the Company pension plans. The benefit payment stream is assumed to be funded from bond coupons and maturities, as well as interest on the excess cash flows from the bond portfolio. Dover has significant amounts of deferred tax assets that are reviewed for recoverability and valued accordingly. These assets are evaluated by using estimates of future taxable income streams and the impact of tax planning strategies. Reserves are also estimated, using a more likely than not criteria, for ongoing audits regarding federal, state and international issues that are currently unresolved. The Company routinely monitors the potential impact of these situations and believes that it is properly reserved. Valuations related to tax accruals and assets can be impacted by changes in accounting regulations, changes in tax codes and rulings, changes in statutory tax rates, and the Company future taxable income levels. Dover has significant accruals and reserves related to the self insured portion of its risk management program. These accruals require the use of estimates and judgment with regard to risk exposure and ultimate liability. The Company estimates losses under these programs using actuarial assumptions, Dover experience, and relevant industry data. Dover reviews these factors quarterly and considers the current level of accruals and reserves adequate relative to current market conditions and Company experience. Dover has established reserves for environmental and legal contingencies at both the operating company and corporate levels. A significant amount of judgment and use of estimates is required to quantify Dover ultimate exposure in these matters. The valuation of reserves for contingencies is reviewed on a quarterly basis at the operating and corporate levels to assure that Dover is properly reserved. Reserve balances are adjusted to account for changes in circumstances for ongoing issues and the establishment of additional 29 Table of Contents reserves for emerging issues. While Dover believes that the current level of reserves is adequate, future changes in circumstances could impact these determinations. The Company from time to time will discontinue certain operations for various reasons. Estimates are used to adjust, if necessary, the assets and liabilities of discontinued operations to their estimated fair market value less costs to sell. These estimates include assumptions relating to the proceeds anticipated as a result of the sale. The adjustments to fair market value of these operations provide the basis for the gain or loss when sold. Changes in business conditions or the inability to sell an operation could potentially require future adjustments to these estimates. The Company uses the Black-Scholes valuation model to estimate the fair value of its Stock Appreciation Rights (SARs) and stock options that are granted to employees. The model requires management to estimate the expected life of the SAR or option, expected forfeitures and the volatility of Dover stock using historical data. For additional information related to the assumptions used, see Note 10 to the Consolidated Financial Statements in Item 8 of this Form 10-K. New Accounting Standards Effective December 31, 2006, Dover adopted SFAS No. 158, Employers Accounting for Defined Benefit Pension and Other Postretirement Plans, an Amendment of Financial Accounting Standards Board ( FASB ) Statements No. 87, 88, 106, and 132(R) ( SFAS No. 158 ). SFAS No. 158 requires companies to report the funded status of their defined benefit pension and other postretirement benefit plans on their balance sheets as a net liability or asset. Upon adoption at December 31, 2006, Dover recorded a net reduction to stockholders equity of $123.5 million, net of tax. In addition, effective for fiscal years ending after December 15, 2008, the new standard will require companies to measure benefit obligations and plan assets as of a Company fiscal year end (December 31, 2008 for Dover), using one of the methods prescribed in the standard. Dover expects to adopt the new valuation date requirements using the 15-month alternative, as prescribed in the standard, which will result in a charge of approximately $10.0 million to retained earnings in the fourth quarter of 2008. Effective January 1, 2007, Dover adopted FASB Interpretation No. 48, Accounting for Uncertainty in Income Taxes ( FIN 48 ). See Note 2 to the Consolidated Financial Statements in Item 8 of this Form 10-K for additional information on the adoption of this standard. In September 2006, the FASB issued SFAS No. 157, Fair Value Measurements ( SFAS No. 157 ), which defines fair value, establishes a framework for measuring fair value in generally accepted accounting principles (GAAP), and expands disclosures about fair value measurements. For financial assets and liabilities, this statement is effective for fiscal periods beginning after November 15, 2007 and does not require any new fair value measurements. In February 2008, the FASB Staff Position No. 157-2 was issued which delayed the effective date of FASB Statement No. 157 to fiscal years ending after November 15, 2008 for nonfinancial assets and liabilities, except for items that are recognized or disclosed at fair value in the financial statements on a recurring basis (at least annually). The Company does not expect the adoption of SFAS No. 157 to have a material effect on its consolidated financial statements. In February 2007, the FASB issued SFAS No. 159, The Fair Value Option for Financial Assets and Financial Liabilities including an amendment of FASB Statement No. 115. This statement permits entities to choose to measure many financial instruments and certain other items at fair value. This statement is effective for financial statements issued for fiscal years beginning after November 15, 2007, including interim periods within that fiscal year. The Company will not elect the fair value option for any of its existing financial instruments as of January 1, 2008 and the Company has not determined whether or not it will elect this option for financial instruments it may acquire in the future. In December 2007, the FASB issued SFAS No. 160, Noncontrolling Interests in Consolidated Financial Statements an amendment of ARB No. 51 ( SFAS 160 ). SFAS 160 requires that a noncontrolling interest in a subsidiary be reported as equity and the amount of consolidated net income specifically attributable to the noncontrolling interest be identified in the consolidated financial statements. It also requires consistency in the manner of reporting changes in the parent ownership interest and requires fair value measurement of any 30 Table of Contents noncontrolling equity investment retained in a deconsolidation. The Company will apply the provisions of this statement prospectively, as required, beginning on January 1, 2009 and does not expect the adoption of SFAS 160 to have a material effect on its consolidated financial statements. In December 2007, the FASB issued SFAS No. 141 (revised 2007), Business Combinations ( SFAS 141(R) ). SFAS 141(R) retains the fundamental requirements in Statement 141 that the acquisition method of accounting (which Statement 141 called the purchase method) be used for all business combinations and for an acquirer to be identified for each business combination. In general, the statement (1) broadens the guidance of SFAS 141, extending its applicability to all events where one entity obtains control over one or more other businesses, (2) broadens the use of fair value measurements used to recognize the assets acquired and liabilities assumed, (3) changes the accounting for acquisition related fees and restructuring costs incurred in connection with an acquisition and (4) increases required disclosures. The Company will apply the provisions of this statement prospectively to business combinations for which the acquisition date is on or after January 1, 2009 and is currently assessing the impact of adoption of SFAS 141(R) on its consolidated financial statements. Non-GAAP Disclosures In an effort to provide investors with additional information regarding the Company results as determined by generally accepted accounting principles (GAAP), the Company also discloses non-GAAP information which management believes provides useful information to investors. Free cash flow, net debt, total debt, total capitalization, adjusted working capital, average annual adjusted working capital, revenues excluding the impact of changes in foreign currency exchange rates and organic revenue growth are not financial measures under GAAP and should not be considered as a substitute for cash flows from operating activities, debt or equity, revenue and working capital as determined in accordance with GAAP, and they may not be comparable to similarly titled measures reported by other companies. Management believes the (1) net debt to total capitalization ratio and (2) free cash flow are important measures of operating performance and liquidity. Net debt to total capitalization is helpful in evaluating the Company capital structure and the amount of leverage it employs. Free cash flow provides both management and investors a measurement of cash generated from operations that is available to fund acquisitions, pay dividends, repay debt and repurchase the Company common stock. Reconciliations of free cash flow, total debt and net debt can be found above in this Item 7, Management Discussion and Analysis. Management believes that reporting adjusted working capital (also sometimes called working capital ), which is calculated as accounts receivable, plus inventory, less accounts payable, provides a meaningful measure of the Company operational results by showing the changes caused solely by revenue. Management believes that reporting adjusted working capital and revenues at constant currency, which excludes the positive or negative impact of fluctuations in foreign currency exchange rates, provides a meaningful measure of the Company operational changes, given the global nature of Dover businesses. Management believes that reporting organic revenue growth, which excludes the impact of foreign currency exchange rates and the impact of acquisitions, provides a useful comparison of the Company revenue performance and trends between periods.
