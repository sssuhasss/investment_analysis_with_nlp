Item 7. Management Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations. You should read the following discussion and analysis of the financial condition and results of operations of Nasdaq in conjunction with our consolidated financial statements and related notes included in this Form 10-K, as well as the discussion under Item 1A. Risk Factors. We have reclassified prior period amounts presented in the discussion and analysis to conform to the 2005 presentation. Overview Nasdaq had a highly successful year in 2005. Our financial performance improved substantially, going from net income of $1.8 million and a loss of $0.14 per diluted share in 2004, to net income of $61.7 million or $0.57 per diluted share in 2005. We also acquired the INET ECN, which we expect will provide us with a technologically superior trading platform, enhance our ability to compete with U.S. and international market centers, and generate cost savings through technology. We describe the INET acquisition in more detail below. We expect to begin migrating trading activity to the INET platform early in the third quarter of 2006. The migration of the customer communication networks resulting from the migration of trading activity to the INET platform is expected to continue into the fourth quarter, resulting in a full integration of INET in the fourth quarter of 2006. During 2005, we also continued with our cost reduction program, and were able to decrease expenses by $64.1 million, or 13.5%, in 2005. We have recently completed several other acquisitions, including: On September 7, 2004, we acquired Brut for total cash consideration of $190.0 million. On January 1, 2005, we acquired the remaining interest in Nasdaq Insurance Agency, and on October 1, 2005, we acquired Carpenter Moore, adding independent insurance brokerage and risk management services to the range of products that we offer. On February 6, 2006, we acquired Shareholder.com, which will allow us to offer a comprehensive suite of investor relations products and services. Our 2005 results were positively impacted by increases in gross margin (revenues less cost of revenues) from our Market Services segment and revenues from our Issuer Services segment. Gross margin from Market Services increased $21.0 million, or 7.5%, to $299.7 million in 2005, compared with $278.7 million in 2004. This increase was primarily due to increases in our market share of trade executions, an increase in the percentage of share volume reported to Nasdaq systems, additional trading activity from the Brut and INET acquisitions, increases in market subscription users, and changes in the amount shared under Nasdaq General Revenue Sharing Program. These increases were partially offset by amounts that Nasdaq paid as liquidity rebates due to increases in market share and activity from Brut and INET and changes to the liquidity rebate tiers. Also, partially offsetting the increase in gross margin were fee reductions for The Nasdaq Market Center introduced in 2004 and a decline in the subscriber base for access services legacy products, which we discontinued as of December 31, 2005. Issuer Services segment revenues increased $20.3 million, or 9.9%, to $226.1 million in 2005, compared with $205.8 million in 2004, primarily due to an increase in Nasdaq annual listing fees implemented in 2005 and revenues from the Nasdaq Insurance Agency, including from the acquisition of Carpenter Moore. These current and prior year items are discussed in more detail below. Our priorities in 2006 are to complete the integration of INET, continue to increase our market share of U.S equity trading and company listings, and raise the value of our proprietary market data products, while maintaining the discipline necessary to complete our cost reduction program. At the same time, we will look for additional sources of revenue through enhanced product offerings and/or potential acquisitions that complement our business. In addition, as contemplated by our acquisition strategy, we have submitted a non-binding indication of interest to acquire the LSE. See Business Competition Acquisition Strategy. INET Acquisition On December 8, 2005, we completed our acquisition of Instinet Group Incorporated and the immediate resale of Instinet Institutional Brokerage division to an affiliate of Silver Lake Partners, or SLP, a private equity firm. As a result of these transactions, Nasdaq owns INET ECN. The aggregate purchase price for all outstanding 37 Table of Contents shares of Instinet was approximately $1.878 billion in cash. Nasdaq paid total cash consideration of approximately $934.5 million, subject to post-closing adjustments, and SLP paid approximately $207.5 million of the purchase price pursuant to the sale of the Institutional Brokerage division. The balance of the $1.878 billion reflects, in part, Instinet available cash, and, in part, a cash dividend of approximately $109.0 million, which Instinet previously paid to its stockholders from the net after-tax proceeds of the sale of Instinet Lynch, Jones & Ryan, Inc., or LJR, brokerage subsidiary. As of December 31, 2005, Nasdaq incurred direct acquisition costs of $34.3 million in connection with the acquisition of Instinet. Nasdaq funded the Instinet acquisition through the sale of Instinet Institutional Brokerage division, a credit facility, and the previous issuance of convertible notes and warrants to SLP and Hellman & Friedman, or H&F (another private equity firm, which has been an investor in Nasdaq since 2001), and with cash on hand from Nasdaq and Instinet. See Note 3, Business Combinations, and Note 7, Debt Obligations, to the consolidated financial statements for further discussion. We believe that INET technologically superior and low cost trading platform will enable us to compete more effectively for trade executions in NYSE and Amex-listed securities and to deliver the increased capabilities demanded by our customers. By the end of 2006, we expect the INET acquisition to begin to accrete to stockholders, primarily as a result of technology cost savings and other synergies, including cost savings from operating a combined trading platform, reduced clearing and settlement expenses, reduced occupancy, compensation and benefits costs, and increased market data revenues. Our 2005 results include activity related to INET from December 8, 2005 through December 31, 2005. Business Segments We manage, operate and provide products and services in two business segments, our Market Services segment and our Issuer Services segment. The Market Services segment includes our transaction-based business (Nasdaq Market Center) and our market information services business (Nasdaq Market Services Subscriptions), which are interrelated because the transaction-based business generates the quote and trade information that we sell to market participants and data vendors. The Issuer Services segment includes our securities listings business and our insurance business (Corporate Client Group) and our financial products business (Nasdaq Financial Products). The companies listed on The Nasdaq Stock Market represent a diverse array of industries. This diversity of Nasdaq-listed companies allows us to develop industry-specific and other Nasdaq indexes that we use to develop and license financial products and associated derivatives. Because of these interrelationships, our management allocates resources, assesses performance and manages these businesses as two separate segments. See Note 18, Segments, to the consolidated financial statements for further discussion. Discontinued Operations Included in our 2004 results is a net gain of $9.6 million from discontinued operations related to the release of a reserve for potential claims established in December 2003 in conjunction with the transfer of Nasdaq ownership of Nasdaq Europe S.A./N.V. Following the transfer of Nasdaq interest in Nasdaq Europe, results from this subsidiary were reclassified as discontinued operations in Nasdaq Consolidated Statements of Income. All prior period information has been presented on the same basis. See Note 19, Discontinued Operations, to the consolidated financial statements for further discussion. The disclosures in this Management Discussion and Analysis reflect results from continuing operations, unless otherwise noted. Cost Reductions and Operating Efficiencies During the past several years, we have taken significant steps to grow our business and enhance our competitive position. We have successfully reduced our technology costs, eliminated non-core products, scaled back our workforce and consolidated our real estate facilities and operations. We expect to realize additional savings from the outsourcing of our disaster recovery systems, which began in September 2005. As a result of 38 Table of Contents outsourced disaster recovery systems, we sold real estate that was no longer needed to house our disaster recovery data center. We are in the process of migrating our technology to INET technologically advanced, low cost platform. We also continued to take steps to exit low-margin products, primarily relating to providing proprietary network connectivity to The Nasdaq Market Center. As of December 31, 2005, we completed the phase out of these low margin access services and expect our revenues and the corresponding expenses to decrease as Nasdaq migrates to industry standards and third party products. The net impact of migrating to these industry standards and third party products will be an increase to Nasdaq operating results. As a result of our cost reduction steps, in 2005 we reduced total direct expenses by $60.3 million, or 14.0%, from $430.8 million to $370.5 million as compared with the same period of 2004. During 2005, we incurred incremental net pre-tax expenses of approximately $20.0 million in connection with taking actions to improve our operational efficiency. Excluding the release of a sublease loss reserve described in Note 4, 2005 and 2004 Cost Reductions and Strategic Review, total pre-tax charges taken during 2005 were $32.1 million. During 2004, we incurred similar charges of approximately $62.6 million. See Note 4, 2005 and 2004 Cost Reductions and Strategic Review, to the consolidated financial statements for further discussion. Some of the key steps we have taken to reduce our costs and expenses include: Reducing our computer operations and data communications expense primarily through the renegotiation of contracts with major suppliers and a reduction in the number of technology operating platforms that we support. In 2005, our computer operations and data communications expense was $62.4 million compared with $98.9 million for 2004, a decrease of $36.5 million, or 36.9%. Reducing our headcount by eliminating 69 positions during 2005. However, headcount increased from 786 at December 31, 2004 to 865 at December 31, 2005, as a result of 147 employees acquired in the INET, Carpenter Moore and Nasdaq Insurance Agency transactions. Consolidating our real estate facilities from occupying approximately 528,800 square feet as of December 31, 2004 to occupying approximately 442,800 square feet as of December 31, 2005. As of December 31, 2005, Nasdaq is committed to approximately 512,400 square feet; of these amounts, we have sublet approximately 69,600 square feet. Sources of Revenues Market Services Nasdaq Market Center The Nasdaq Market Center is our transaction-based platform that provides our market participants with access to The Nasdaq Stock Market execution services, such as quoting and trading capabilities, and reporting services such as trade reporting and risk management. We provide these quoting, trading, and trade reporting services for securities listed on The Nasdaq National Market and The Nasdaq Capital Market, formerly known as The Nasdaq SmallCap Market, and up until September 30, 2005, for securities authorized for trading on the OTCBB and for securities that are traded in the Over-the-Counter, or OTC, market by NASD members. Effective October 1, 2005, we transferred responsibility for the OTCBB and OTC to NASD. See Note 11, Related Party Transactions, to the consolidated financial statements for further discussion. We provide our customers with the ability to execute trades electronically in equity securities. The primary fee for these execution services is a transaction execution charge, assessed on a per share basis to the party that accesses the liquidity provided by another market participant. In most circumstances, we credit a portion of the per share execution charge as a rebate to the market participant that provides the liquidity. We also earn revenues based on our share of trading securities listed on the NYSE and Amex. Many of our competitors engage in aggressive price competition by reducing the transaction fees they charge customers for trade execution. As a 39 Table of Contents result of this competition, during 2005, we significantly reduced the transaction fees we charge our customers for trade execution, particularly for large-volume customers. In early 2006, in connection with our acquisition of INET, we adjusted our transaction fees to harmonize our pricing structure with INET, whose fees had been higher than ours. We plan to periodically re-examine our pricing structure to ensure that our fees remain competitive. The Nasdaq Market Center also provides three primary revenue-generating reporting services: trade reporting, trade comparison and risk management. Although we do not currently charge market participants for most of the trades they report to us, we do earn revenues for all trades reported to us in the form of shared market information revenues under the UTP Plan. Trade comparison revenues are generated by matching two market participants to a trade that they have submitted to us for trade reporting for a fee. We also provide clearing firms with risk management services for a fee to assist them in monitoring their exposure to their correspondent brokers. Finally, The Nasdaq Market Center provides market participants with the ability to access, process, display and integrate orders and quotes. We provide our market participants with several alternatives for accessing The Nasdaq Market Center for a fee. During 2005 we completed the necessary steps to exit low-margin businesses such as access services legacy products. See Operating Results-Nasdaq Market Center . Nasdaq Market Services Subscriptions The primary source of revenues for Nasdaq Market Services Subscriptions is the collection and dissemination of price quotations and information regarding price and volume of executed trades. We collect information, distribute it and earn revenues in two capacities: as a member of the UTP Plan and as a distributor of our proprietary market data. We also operate as the exclusive Securities Information Processor as part of the UTP Plan for the collection and dissemination of the best bid and offer information and last transaction information from the exchanges and markets that quote and trade in Nasdaq-listed securities. We do not generate any profits from our role as the Securities Information Processor. In our role as the Securities Information Processor, we disseminate information to data vendors, which the data vendors then sell to the public. After deducting our expenses incurred as the Securities Information Processor, we distribute the tape fees to the respective UTP Plan participants, including ourselves, based on a combination of the participants respective annual trade volume and share volume. Since our sharing in the UTP Plan is based on our market share, our revenues from the sale of market information products and services are under competitive pressure from other securities exchanges that trade Nasdaq-listed securities. As a result, we have implemented the General Revenue Sharing Program, which provides an incentive for quoting market participants to send orders and report trades to The Nasdaq Market Center to stabilize Nasdaq share of UTP Plan revenues. Once we become operational as an exchange, we will no longer have to share our revenues under the UTP Plan related to information about our individual market participants quotations. We will still be required to share UTP Plan revenues related to trade reports and the best priced quotations in our market. We also sell proprietary data products to market participants that choose to display trading interest on The Nasdaq Market Center. We offer a range of proprietary data products including TotalView, our flagship market depth quote product. We operate several other proprietary services and data feed products, including the Mutual Fund Quotation Service; the Mutual Fund Dissemination Service; our financial websites, Nasdaq.com and NasdaqTrader.com; and Nasdaq Index Dissemination Service. In January 2005, we launched Nasdaq OpenView, which is similar to TotalView, but displays market depth for NYSE-listed and Amex-listed stocks. In addition, we also introduced OrderView and ModelView in 2005. See Item 1. Business Products and Services for a discussion of our proprietary data products. 40 Table of Contents Issuer Services Corporate Client Group The Corporate Client Group provides customer support services and products to Nasdaq-listed companies and is responsible for obtaining new listings on The Nasdaq Stock Market. We charge issuers an initial listing fee, a fee for listing of additional shares and an annual fee. The initial listing fee for securities listed on The Nasdaq Stock Market includes a listing application fee and a total shares outstanding fee. The fee for listing of additional shares is based on the total shares outstanding, which we review quarterly. Annual fees for securities listed on The Nasdaq Stock Market are based on total shares outstanding. In the beginning of 2005, Nasdaq increased the amount of its annual fees for both The Nasdaq National Market and The Nasdaq Capital Market in a range of approximately 14.0% to 31.0%. Initial listing and listing of additional shares fees are recognized on a straight-line basis over estimated service periods, which are six and four years, respectively, based on our historical listing experience, pursuant to the requirements of SEC Staff Accounting Bulletin Topic 13: Revenue Recognition ( SAB Topic 13 ). On January 1, 2005, we purchased the remaining 50.0% interest in the Nasdaq Insurance Agency from AIG for nominal consideration. The agency provides insurance brokerage services and specializes in the director and officer liability insurance market. On October 1, 2005, we completed the acquisition of Carpenter Moore, a San Francisco-based insurance brokerage firm specializing in management liability. The purchases of the Nasdaq Insurance Agency and Carpenter Moore provide current and future Nasdaq-listed companies and other customers with a full service corporate insurance broker offering customized risk management advice and insurance placement services. Carpenter Moore also added depth of brokerage expertise in directors and officers, errors and omissions and other management liability insurance products, and has significantly expanded regional coverage. Our 2005 results include the full year results of the Nasdaq Insurance Agency and activity related to Carpenter Moore from October 1, 2005 through December 31, 2005. See Note 3, Business Combinations, to the consolidated financial statements for further discussion. Nasdaq Financial Products Nasdaq Financial Products is responsible for introducing products that leverage, extend and enhance the Nasdaq brand. Nasdaq Financial Products oversees the licensing of third party Nasdaq-branded financial products based on Nasdaq indexes. In addition to licensing revenues, these products, particularly ETFs, can lead to increased investments in companies listed on The Nasdaq Stock Market, which, in turn, could benefit our Market Services revenues. The Nasdaq-listed QQQ is one of the most actively traded ETFs in the world and the most actively traded listed equity security in the United States. On December 1, 2004, the QQQ transferred its listing to Nasdaq from Amex. Nasdaq and Amex reached a mutual decision to transfer the QQQ earlier than the contractual date of June 2005. It trades under the symbol QQQQ. We have also introduced financial products based on other Nasdaq indexes, including the Nasdaq Composite Index and the Nasdaq Biotechnology Index. We believe that these products leverage, extend and enhance the Nasdaq brand. We license the right to use our trademarks in connection with trading QQQ under the UTP Plan to major stock markets in the United States. Every major options market in the United States also licenses the right to use our trademarks to trade the equity options on QQQ from us. In addition, QQQ has a national advertising campaign, which is separate from ours and paid for by QQQ, which demonstrates the success of the companies included in the Nasdaq-100 Index. Nasdaq ability to collect licensing revenues for options on ETFs that track its indexes (such as QQQ) may be impacted by the outcome of two pending cases involving other index providers. The U.S. District Court for the Southern District of New York recently dismissed these actions brought by McGraw-Hill and Dow Jones against an options market that threatened to trade options based on their proprietary indexes without a license. 41 Table of Contents Both plaintiffs have appealed the dismissals and Nasdaq, while not a party to these actions, has filed an amicus brief in both cases supporting plaintiffs positions. Nasdaq intends to protect its right to require licenses with options markets that trade options on ETFs that track its indexes. Should the plaintiffs not be successful in this litigation, it could impact our ability to collect licensing revenues. Nasdaq Operating Results The following table includes data showing average daily share volume in Nasdaq-listed securities and the percentage of share volume of Nasdaq-listed securities reported to The Nasdaq Market Center. In addition, the table shows drivers for our Issuer Services segment, including initial public offerings and number of listed companies. In evaluating the performance of our business, our senior management closely watches these key drivers. Year Ended December 31, 2005 2004 2003 Average daily share volume in Nasdaq-listed securities (in billions) 1.80 1.81 1.69 Percentage of share volume of Nasdaq-listed securities reported to The Nasdaq Market Center (1) 57.0 % 51.3 % 67.0 % Initial public offerings 126 148 54 Secondary offerings 222 233 190 New listings (2) 269 260 134 Number of listed companies (3) 3,208 3,271 3,333 (1) For 2005, consists of all trades in Nasdaq-listed securities reported to The Nasdaq Market Center as well as INET activity since December 8, 2005. (2) Includes initial public offerings, including those completed on a best efforts basis, and listings that switched from other listing venues. (3) Number of listed companies as of period end. The following table shows our total revenues by segment, cost of revenues and gross margin: Year Ended December 31, 2005 2004 2003 (in millions) Market Services $ 653.6 $ 334.5 $ 383.7 Issuer Services 226.1 205.8 204.2 Other 0.2 0.1 1.9 Total revenues $ 879.9 $ 540.4 $ 589.8 Liquidity rebates (255.5 ) (38.1 ) Brokerage, clearance and exchange fees (98.4 ) (17.7 ) Total cost of revenues (353.9 ) (55.8 ) Gross margin $ 526.0 $ 484.6 $ 589.8 42 Table of Contents MARKET SERVICES The following table shows total revenues, cost of revenues and gross margin from our Market Services segment: Year Ended December 31, 2005 2004 2003 (in millions) Nasdaq Market Center: Execution and trade reporting revenues $ 496.1 $ 289.1 $ 285.4 Access services revenues 80.4 89.6 103.1 Liquidity rebates (1) (35.5 ) (130.1 ) (127.4 ) Tape fee revenue sharing (11.5 ) (8.1 ) (13.8 ) Nasdaq General Revenue Sharing Program (0.4 ) (2.3 ) Total Nasdaq Market Center revenues 529.1 238.2 247.3 Cost of revenues Liquidity rebates (1) (255.5 ) (38.1 ) Brokerage, clearance and exchange fees (98.4 ) (17.7 ) Total cost of revenues (353.9 ) (55.8 ) Gross margin from Nasdaq Market Center 175.2 182.4 247.3 Nasdaq Market Services Subscriptions: Revenues (2) 187.6 183.0 179.0 Nasdaq General Revenue Sharing Program (5.5 ) (17.8 ) UTP Plan revenue sharing (77.9 ) (79.4 ) (50.8 ) Total Nasdaq Market Services Subscriptions revenues 104.2 85.8 128.2 Other Market Services revenues 20.3 10.5 8.2 Gross margin from Market Services $ 299.7 $ 278.7 $ 383.7 (1) As noted in Note 2, Summary of Significant Accounting Policies, to the consolidated financial statements, Nasdaq began reporting all execution revenues from transactions executed through The Nasdaq Market Center on a gross basis in execution and trade reporting revenues and has recorded liquidity rebate payments as cost of revenues as Nasdaq now has certain risk associated with trade execution subject to rule limitations and caps. This change in fact was made on a prospective basis beginning April 1, 2005 as required under United States GAAP. The Nasdaq Market Center liquidity rebates were $35.5 million for the period January 1, 2005 through March 31, 2005 and was $94.0 for the period of April 1, 2005 through December 31, 2005. The remainder of the liquidity rebates shown in cost of revenues relates to Brut and INET. (2) Includes eligible and non-eligible UTP Plan revenues. Eligible UTP Plan revenues are associated with the calculation and dissemination of the consolidated national best bid and best offer ( inside quote ) and last sale information. These revenues are shared among UTP Plan participants. Non-eligible UTP Plan revenues are associated with the calculation and dissemination of proprietary Nasdaq information and are not shared among UTP Plan participants. Nasdaq Market Center Execution and trade reporting revenues increased $207.0 million, or 71.6%, in 2005 compared with 2004 and increased $3.7 million, or 1.3%, in 2004 compared with 2003. The increase in 2005 was primarily due to increases in Nasdaq execution market share for both Nasdaq-listed securities and securities listed on other exchanges, an increase in the percentage of share volume reported to Nasdaq systems, despite a decrease in average daily share volume and additional trading activity due to the acquisitions of Brut and INET. In 2004, Brut results were included beginning September 7, 2004, compared with a full year of operations in 2005. 43 Table of Contents Partially offsetting these increases were decreases in trade reporting and fee reductions for The Nasdaq Market Center introduced in 2004. The increase in execution and trade reporting revenues in 2004 compared with 2003 was primarily due to additional activity from the acquisition of Brut and an increase in average daily share volume. Partially offsetting these increases was a decline in the percentage of share volume reported to Nasdaq systems and the effect of price reductions. In January 2004, we implemented a new tiered pricing structure geared toward drawing increased liquidity to Nasdaq trading platform. The new tiered pricing structure lowers execution charges to market participants based on the amount of liquidity a participant provides. Despite increases in execution and trade reporting revenues, gross margin from Nasdaq Market Center decreased $7.2 million, or 3.9%, in 2005 compared with 2004, and decreased $64.9 million, or 26.2%, in 2004 compared with 2003. The decreases in gross margin were due to increases in the amount that Nasdaq rebated as a result of the increases from Brut activity and changes to the liquidity rebate tiers. Additionally, the decrease in gross margin in 2005 was due to increases in the amount Nasdaq rebated as a result of additional INET activity and an increase in market share. Access services revenues decreased $9.2 million, or 10.3%, in 2005 compared with 2004 and decreased $13.5 million, or 13.1%, in 2004 compared with 2003, primarily due to a decline in the subscriber base for access services legacy products, which we discontinued as of December 31, 2005. The revenues for these discontinued products totaled $58.3 million in 2005 compared with $74.1 million and $89.0 million for the same periods of 2004 and 2003, respectively. In 2005, we migrated users away from Nasdaq proprietary network connectivity towards industry standards and third-party networks. By doing so, we have been able to and will continue to reduce our technology and network costs and increase our systems scalability without affecting performance or reliability. Expenses related to the discontinued products were $46.5 million, $94.3 million and $115.6 million for the year ended December 31, 2005, 2004 and 2003, respectively. The industry standards and third-party products are more efficient and cost effective but produce lower revenues. However, these products will contribute more to Nasdaq operating results than Nasdaq access services legacy products. Also contributing to the decreases in 2005 and 2004 were continued market participant consolidations. Nasdaq Market Center liquidity rebates, in which we credit a portion of the per share execution charge to the market participant that provides the liquidity, were $255.5 million and $38.1 million for the year ended December 31, 2005 and 2004, respectively, of which $94.0 million relates to liquidity rebate payments for the non-Brut and non-INET portion of The Nasdaq Market Center in 2005. The remaining rebate amounts of $161.5 million and $38.1 million in 2005 and 2004, respectively, are Brut liquidity rebates and beginning December 8, 2005, INET liquidity rebates. Brokerage, clearance and exchange fees were $98.4 million and $17.7 million in 2005 and 2004, respectively, and are additional cost of revenues for Brut and INET. The increase in both liquidity rebates and brokerage, clearance and exchange fees in 2005 were primarily due to a full year of Brut operations compared with four months in 2004, additional activity from INET operations and increases in market share. Pursuant to EITF 99-19, Nasdaq records execution revenues from transactions executed through Brut on a gross basis in revenues and records expenses such as liquidity rebate payments as cost of revenues as both Brut and INET act as principal. Before the second quarter of 2005, Nasdaq reported other execution revenues net of liquidity rebates, which totaled $35.5 million, $130.1 million and $127.4 million for the year ended December 31, 2005, 2004 and 2003, respectively, as Nasdaq does not act as principal. However, during and since the second quarter of 2005 under Nasdaq new Limitation of Liability Rule, Nasdaq, subject to certain caps, provides compensation for losses due to malfunctions of the order-execution systems of The Nasdaq Market Center. Therefore, under EITF 99-19, Nasdaq has recorded all execution revenues from transactions executed through The Nasdaq Market Center on a gross basis in execution and trade reporting revenues and has recorded liquidity rebate payments as cost of revenues as Nasdaq now has certain risk associated with trade execution subject to rule limitations and caps. This rule change in fact was made on a prospective basis beginning April 1, 2005 as required under United States GAAP. This rule change did not have a material impact on the consolidated financial position or results of operations of Nasdaq in the second, third or fourth quarters of 2005. The increase in liquidity rebates in 2004 compared with 2003 was due to an increase in the per share liquidity rebate in April 44 Table of Contents and November 2004 for Nasdaq-listed securities and higher overall average daily share volume of market participants on The Nasdaq Stock Market. Partially offsetting the increase in 2004, was the elimination of the liquidity rebate for all NYSE-listed securities in December 2003 and certain Amex-listed securities in May 2004. Nasdaq Market Center tape fee revenue sharing increased $3.4 million, or 42.0%, in 2005 compared with 2004 and decreased $5.7 million, or 41.3%, in 2004 compared with 2003. We share tape fee revenues from NYSE-listed and Amex-listed securities through The Nasdaq Market Center tape fee revenue sharing. We earn tape fee revenues from NYSE-listed and Amex-listed securities based upon both the percentage of trades reported to The Nasdaq Market Center for securities listed on these exchanges and the size of NYSE and Amex revenue sharing pools. The increase in 2005 was primarily due to an increase in Nasdaq market share in both NYSE-listed and Amex-listed securities. The decrease in 2004 was primarily due to INET reporting additional trading activity to The National Stock Exchange in the first quarter of 2004 as opposed to us as it had previously done. Also throughout 2004, Archipelago significantly increased the number of trades it printed, which resulted in lower market share for Nasdaq along with a decrease in the amount of tape fee revenue sharing. In January 2004, The Nasdaq Market Center began sharing revenues under the Nasdaq General Revenue Sharing Program. This discretionary program requires us to share operating revenue, which is interpreted to mean net revenue after expenses from all services that derive revenue from member trading and trade-reporting activity in Nasdaq-listed securities. As such, the program is designed to provide an incentive for quoting market participants to send orders and report trades to The Nasdaq Market Center. The amount of Nasdaq Market Center revenues shared under the Nasdaq General Revenue Sharing Program decreased $1.9 million, or 82.6%, in 2005 compared with 2004. This decrease was primarily due to changes in the amount shared under the program. Nasdaq Market Services Subscriptions We provide subscribers with inside quote and last trade information through Level 1, the best quote information for each market participant through Nasdaq Quotation Dissemination Services, or NQDS, and all price levels for each market participant through TotalView. These services are provided for securities listed on The Nasdaq Stock Market to both professional and non-professional users. We also provide subscribers with quote information at all price levels for each market participant trading of NYSE-listed and Amex-listed stocks through OpenView. In addition, we provide Mutual Fund Quotation Service, or MFQS, a service that collects and disseminates daily price and related data for unit investment trusts, mutual funds and money market funds that are subscribers to this service. These subscription revenues, which include eligible and non-eligible UTP Plan revenues, increased $4.6 million, or 2.5%, in 2005 compared with 2004 and increased $4.0 million, or 2.2%, in 2004 compared with 2003. The increase in 2005 was primarily due to an increase in TotalView subscribers and the launch of OpenView in January 2005. Level 1 and NQDS professional and nonprofessional subscriptions remained relatively flat year over year. However, non-professional Level 1 and NQDS subscriptions and professional NQDS subscriptions increased in 2004 resulting in an increase in revenues compared with 2003. In addition, we introduced a distribution fee for MFQS beginning in the fourth quarter of 2003, which resulted in additional revenues in 2004. In January 2004, we began sharing Market Services Subscriptions revenues under the Nasdaq General Revenue Sharing Program, as discussed above. The amount of Nasdaq Market Services Subscriptions revenues shared under the Nasdaq General Revenue Sharing Program decreased $12.3 million, or 69.1%, in 2005 compared with 2004. This decrease was primarily due to changes in the amount shared under the program. Nasdaq also shares tape fee revenues (i.e., revenues from the sale of tape data) for Nasdaq-listed securities through the UTP Plan. Under the revenue sharing provision of the UTP Plan, Nasdaq is permitted to deduct costs associated with acting as the exclusive Securities Information Processor from the total amount of tape fees collected. After these costs are deducted from the tape fees, we distribute to the respective UTP Plan participants, including Nasdaq, their share of tape fees based on a combination of their respective trade volume and share volume. Nasdaq tape fee revenue sharing allocated to UTP Plan participants decreased $1.5 million, or 1.9%, in 45 Table of Contents 2005 compared with 2004 and increased $28.6 million, or 56.3%, in 2004 compared with 2003. The decrease in UTP Plan revenue sharing in 2005 was primarily due to a stronger market share, which includes Brut trade reporting activity for a full year, decreasing the amount Nasdaq shared with UTP participants. Brut began to report its trades to The Nasdaq Market Center on September 1, 2004. Partially offsetting the stronger market share, was a reduction in the costs of operating the Securities Information Processor and administering the UTP Plan. Nasdaq operates the Securities Information Processor and administers the UTP Plan, and due to significant cost reduction efforts within Nasdaq, Nasdaq has been able to reduce the costs of those activities, to the benefit of all UTP Plan exchanges that trade Nasdaq-listed securities. The cost reductions resulted in an increase in net shareable income. The increase in UTP Plan revenue sharing in 2004 compared with 2003 was primarily due to a decline in the percentage of share volume reported to Nasdaq systems as continued competitive pressures from ECNs continued to draw activity away from Nasdaq systems to regional exchanges that are members of the UTP Plan and that trade Nasdaq-listed securities. In 2004, the increase was partially offset by a decline in trade reporting activity from The Boston Stock Exchange after Brut began to report its trades to The Nasdaq Market Center on September 1, 2004. This change resulted in a decrease to UTP Plan revenue sharing of approximately $6.0 million for the year ended December 31, 2004. Other Market Services Other Market Services revenues increased $9.8 million, or 93.3%, in 2005 compared with 2004 and increased $2.3 million, or 28.0%, in 2004 compared with 2003. The increase in 2005 was primarily due to a new contract between NASD and Nasdaq for the operations of the OTCBB, which took effect on October 1, 2005. Nasdaq transferred responsibility for the OTCBB back to NASD, but agreed to continue to operate the OTCBB on a contract basis for two years, subject to renewals. See Note 11, Related Party Transactions, to the consolidated financial statements for further discussion. Also contributing to the increase in 2005 and the increase in 2004 was the receipt of revenues from NASD for technology and development support services that we provided to NASD for a fixed income trade reporting platform beginning November 1, 2004. As discussed in Note 11, Related Party Transactions, to the consolidated financial statements, Nasdaq entered into a new contract with NASD in November 2004 for the technology and development support services. ISSUER SERVICES The following table shows the revenues from our Issuer Services segment: Year Ended December 31, 2005 2004 2003 (in millions) Issuer Services: Corporate Client Group $ 187.6 $ 165.3 $ 168.3 Nasdaq Financial Products 38.5 40.5 35.9 Total Issuer Services revenues $ 226.1 $ 205.8 $ 204.2 Corporate Client Group The following table shows the revenues from the Corporate Client Group as reported in accordance with United States GAAP ( as reported ) and as would be reported on a non-GAAP basis ( billed basis ). We believe that the presentation of billed basis revenues, as they relate to listing of additional shares and initial listing fees, is a good indicator of current Corporate Client Group activity since the billed basis information excludes the effects of recognizing revenues related to initial listing fees and listing of additional shares fees over the six and four year periods, respectively. 46 Table of Contents Year Ended December 31, 2005 2004 2003 As Reported Billed Basis As Reported Billed Basis As Reported Billed Basis (in millions) Annual renewal fees $ 107.8 $ 107.8 $ 91.4 $ 91.4 $ 93.9 $ 93.9 Listing of additional shares fees 37.6 37.4 36.8 45.9 37.1 30.2 Initial listing fees 29.2 24.5 31.1 27.1 32.3 16.9 Nasdaq Insurance Agency 8.1 8.1 Other Corporate Client Group revenues 4.9 4.9 6.0 6.0 5.0 5.0 Total Corporate Client Group revenues $ 187.6 $ 182.7 $ 165.3 $ 170.4 $ 168.3 $ 146.0 Corporate Client Group revenues, on an as reported basis, increased $22.3 million, or 13.5%, in 2005 compared with 2004 and decreased $3.0 million, or 1.8%, in 2004 compared with 2003. Corporate Client Group revenues are primarily derived from fees for annual renewals, listing of additional shares and initial listings for companies listed on The Nasdaq Stock Market. Fees are generally calculated based upon total shares outstanding for the issuing company. These fees are initially deferred and amortized over the estimated periods for which the services are provided. Revenues from annual renewal fees are amortized on a pro-rata basis over the calendar year and initial listing fees and listing of additional shares fees are amortized over six and four years, respectively. The difference between the as reported revenues and the billed basis revenues is due to the amortization of fees in accordance with United States GAAP. See Note 6, Deferred Revenue, to the consolidated financial statements for further discussion. Annual renewal fees on both an as reported and billed basis increased $16.4 million, or 17.9% in 2005 compared with 2004 and decreased $2.5 million, or 2.7%, in 2004 compared with 2003. The increase in 2005 was primarily due to an increase in the annual renewal fees in 2005 for both The Nasdaq National Market and The Nasdaq Capital Market in a range of approximately 14.0% to 31.0%. A decrease in the number of companies listed on The Nasdaq Stock Market partially offset the increase in fees in 2005 and was the primary cause for the decrease in 2004. The number of companies listed on The Nasdaq Stock Market on January 1, 2005, 2004 and 2003 was 3,271, 3,333 and 3,659 respectively, the date on which listed companies are billed their annual fees. The decrease in the number of listed companies in 2004 was due to 322 issuers delisted by Nasdaq during 2004, partially offset by 260 new listings in 2004. The decrease in the number of listed companies in 2003 was due to 460 issuers delisted by Nasdaq during 2003, partially offset by 134 new listings in 2003. The delistings in both 2004 and 2003 were primarily for failure to meet The Nasdaq Stock Market listing standards and other reasons, including mergers and acquisitions. Listing of additional shares fees, on an as reported basis, increased $0.8 million, or 2.2%, in 2005 compared with 2004 and decreased $0.3 million, or 0.8% in 2004 compared with 2003. On a billed basis, listing of additional shares fees decreased $8.5 million, or 18.5%, in 2005 compared with 2004 and increased $15.7 million, or 52.0%, in 2004 compared with 2003. The decrease in listing of additional share fees on a billed basis in 2005 was primarily due to a decline in secondary offerings as well as the size of the respective offerings. The increase in listing of additional shares fees on a billed basis in 2004 was primarily due to an improved economic environment in 2004, which resulted in higher activity for secondary offerings as well as other additional share activity. There were 222, 233 and 190 secondary offerings during 2005, 2004, and 2003, respectively. In 2004, the increase in listing of additional share fees on a billed basis was also due to the adoption of a new fee structure. This fee structure increased the minimum fee and eliminated a quarterly cap. The annual cap was not impacted. Initial listing fees, on an as reported basis, decreased $1.9 million, or 6.1%, in 2005 compared with 2004 and decreased $1.2 million, or 3.7%, in 2004 compared with 2003. On a billed basis, initial listing fees decreased $2.6 million, or 9.6%, in 2005 compared with 2004 and increased $10.2 million, or 60.4%, in 2004 compared 47 Table of Contents with 2003. The decrease in initial listing fees on a billed basis in 2005 was primarily due to a decline in the number of initial public offerings. Also, contributing to the decrease in 2005 was the elimination of entry fees in 2005 for companies that switched to The Nasdaq National Market or The Nasdaq Capital Market from other exchanges and a decline in the number of companies that switched between The Nasdaq National Market and The Nasdaq Capital Market. Listed-companies are charged an entry fee for switching between the two Nasdaq markets. There were 269 new listings, including 126 new initial public offerings, during 2005 compared with 260 new listings, including 148 new initial public offerings, during 2004. The increase in initial listing fees on a billed basis in 2004 was primarily due to an increase in the number of new listings and initial public offerings. In 2003, there were 134 new listings, including 54 new initial public offerings. Nasdaq Insurance Agency revenues on both an as reported and billed basis were $8.1 million for the year ended December 31, 2005. Beginning January 1, 2005, as a result of acquiring the remaining 50.0% interest in the Nasdaq Insurance Agency, the accounts of the Nasdaq Insurance Agency are now consolidated with Nasdaq results. Also included in Nasdaq Insurance Agency revenues are revenues from Carpenter Moore beginning October 1, 2005. Other Corporate Client Group revenues on both an as reported and billed basis decreased $1.1 million, or 18.3%, in 2005 compared with 2004 and decreased $1.0 million, or 20.0%, in 2004 compared with 2003. Nasdaq Financial Products The following table shows revenues from Nasdaq Financial Products: Year Ended December 31, 2005 2004 2003 (in millions) Licensing revenues $ 34.5 $ 36.7 $ 32.9 Other Nasdaq Financial Products revenues 4.0 3.8 3.0 Total Nasdaq Financial Products revenues $ 38.5 $ 40.5 $ 35.9 Nasdaq Financial Products revenues decreased $2.0 million, or 4.9%, in 2005 compared with 2004 and increased $4.6 million, or 12.8%, in 2004 compared with 2003. Licensing revenues decreased $2.2 million, or 6.0%, in 2005 compared with 2004 and increased $3.8 million, or 11.6% in 2004 compared with 2003. The decrease in 2005 was primarily due to reduced licensing revenues related to the QQQ as a result of its listing moving from Amex to The Nasdaq Stock Market in the fourth quarter of 2004. The increase in 2004 was primarily due to an increase in options trading volume on QQQ and an increase in options and futures trading volume on Nasdaq indexes. Also contributing to the increase in 2004 was a fee increase implemented during the year. Licensing revenues primarily include trademark and licensing revenues related to the QQQ and other financial products linked to Nasdaq indexes issued in the United States and abroad. Other Revenues Other revenues increased $0.1 million, or 100.0%, in 2005 compared with 2004 and decreased $1.8 million, or 94.7%, in 2004 compared with 2003. In September 2003, Nasdaq recorded the receipt of a business interruption insurance claim related to the events of September 11, 2001 of $1.9 million. 48 Table of Contents Direct Expenses The following table shows our direct expenses: Year Ended December 31, 2005 2004 2003 (in millions) Compensation and benefits $ 152.1 $ 148.2 $ 159.1 Marketing and advertising 9.0 12.8 19.5 Depreciation and amortization 67.0 76.3 90.0 Professional and contract services 29.1 23.7 37.5 Computer operations and data communications 62.4 98.9 125.6 Provision for bad debts 3.0 1.1 1.4 Occupancy 28.4 28.7 31.2 General and administrative 19.5 41.1 28.4 Total direct expenses $ 370.5 $ 430.8 $ 492.7 Direct expenses decreased $60.3 million, or 14.0%, in 2005 compared with 2004 and decreased $61.9 million, or 12.6%, in 2004 compared with 2003. These decreases were primarily due to a reduction in general and administrative expense in 2005 and reductions in computer operations and data communications expense and depreciation and amortization expense in both 2005 and 2004. Compensation and benefits expense increased $3.9 million, or 2.6%, in 2005 compared with 2004, and decreased $10.9 million, or 6.9%, in 2004 compared with 2003. The increase in 2005 was primarily due to higher salary expense as a result of an increase in headcount in 2005 and increased incentive compensation reflecting stronger financial performance. Total headcount was 865 on December 31, 2005 compared with 786 on December 31, 2004. The increase in headcount was due to the acquisitions of INET, Carpenter Moore and Nasdaq Insurance Agency, partially offset by reductions in force in 2005. Partially offsetting the increase in 2005 was lower severance and outplacement charges compared with 2004. In 2004, 146 positions were eliminated and in 2005, there were workforce reductions eliminating 69 positions. The decrease in compensation and benefits in 2004 was primarily due to lower costs associated with decreased headcount due to workforce reductions as a result of our 2003 strategic review, which eliminated a total of 329 positions, and additional headcount reductions in 2004. Total headcount was 956 on December 31, 2003. Partially offsetting the decrease in 2004 were charges recorded in 2004 for severance and outplacement costs related to workforce reductions and additional costs for a sales commission program introduced in the fourth quarter of 2003. In 2003, severance charges were recorded in the elimination of non-core product lines, initiatives and severance line item in the Consolidated Statements of Income. See Note 4, 2005 and 2004 Cost Reductions and Strategic Review, to the consolidated financial statements for further discussion. Marketing and advertising expense decreased $3.8 million, or 29.7%, in 2005 compared with 2004 and decreased $6.7 million, or 34.4%, in 2004 compared with 2003. These decreases were primarily due to a decline in overall marketing and advertising expenditures, as part of Nasdaq cost reduction plan. Depreciation and amortization expense decreased $9.3 million, or 12.2%, in 2005 compared with 2004 and decreased $13.7 million, or 15.2%, in 2004 compared with 2003. These decreases in depreciation and amortization expense were primarily due to declines in incremental depreciation and amortization expense on equipment associated with Nasdaq quoting platform and its trading and quoting network as Nasdaq migrates to lower cost operating environments as part of our cost reduction plan. However, as a result of the acquisition of INET, Nasdaq has begun to migrate The Nasdaq Market Center to INET lower cost trading system and expects to complete the migration by the fourth quarter of 2006. Therefore, beginning December 8, 2005, Nasdaq recorded additional amortization expense due to a change in estimated useful life of some of The Nasdaq Market Center assets, partially offsetting the decrease noted above. Also partially offsetting the decrease in 2005 was 49 Table of Contents intangible amortization expense on identifiable intangible assets acquired in the INET, Brut, Nasdaq Insurance Agency and Carpenter Moore acquisitions. Amortization expense on the intangible assets acquired in the INET transaction were recorded since the date of acquisition of December 8, 2005 through December 31, 2005. Therefore, amortization expense on these intangible assets in 2006 will be significantly higher. The elimination of certain products as part of Nasdaq 2003 strategic review also contributed to the decline in depreciation and amortization expense in 2004. See Note 3, Business Combinations, and Note 4, 2005 and 2004 Cost Reductions and Strategic Review, to the consolidated financial statements for further discussion. Professional and contract services expense increased $5.4 million, or 22.8%, in 2005 compared with 2004 and decreased $13.8 million, or 36.8%, in 2004 compared with 2003. The increase in 2005 was primarily due to reduced cost reimbursements for support services from NASD related to a new contract entered into with NASD on November 1, 2004 for a fixed income trade reporting platform. See Note 11, Related Party Transactions, to the consolidated financial statements for further discussion. Also contributing to the increase in 2005 was an increase in professional fees associated with Sarbanes-Oxley compliance due to our recent acquisitions. The decrease in 2004 was primarily due to less reliance on outside contractors as part of Nasdaq cost reduction plan. Computer operations and data communications expense decreased $36.5 million, or 36.9%, in 2005 compared with 2004 and decreased $26.7 million, or 21.3%, in 2004 compared with 2003. These decreases were primarily due to lower costs due to the favorable renegotiation of certain maintenance contracts and hardware leases due to the planned retirement of certain equipment and lower costs associated with providing communication lines to customers due to lower demand for access services legacy products, which as of December 31, 2005 were discontinued. Also contributing to the decreases were lower costs associated with our renegotiated contract with MCI effective in the second quarters of 2004 and 2002. For further discussion of the discontinuation of access services legacy products, See Operating Results-Nasdaq Market Center. For the year ended December 31, 2004, the elimination of certain products as part of Nasdaq 2003 strategic review further contributed to the decrease, partially offset by a change in the terms of operating leases associated with Nasdaq quoting platform and our trading and quoting network as Nasdaq migrates to lower cost operating environments. Provision for bad debts increased $1.9 million in 2005 compared with 2004 and decreased $0.3 million, or 21.4%, in 2004 compared with 2003. As a result of the INET acquisition, an additional bad debt reserve for INET was recorded in 2005 in order for INET to be in compliance with Nasdaq reserve policy. An increase in collections and decreases in past due account balances partially offset the increase in 2005 and was the primary cause for the decrease in 2004. Occupancy expense decreased $0.3 million, or 1.0%, in 2005 compared with 2004 and decreased $2.5 million, or 8.0%, in 2004 compared with 2003. These decreases were primarily due to consolidation of leased office space as part of Nasdaq cost reduction plans. General and administrative expense decreased $21.6 million, or 52.6%, in 2005 compared with 2004 and increased $12.7 million, or 44.7%, in 2004 compared with 2003. The decrease in 2005 was primarily due to decisions affecting Nasdaq real estate. In 2004, Nasdaq recorded sublease losses totaling $17.6 million primarily for expansion space at Nasdaq headquarters located in New York which Nasdaq management did not intend to occupy. However, as a result of the acquisition of INET, Nasdaq will now occupy the expansion space for INET operations and recorded a release of the sublease loss reserve of $12.1 million, net of rental payments, in the fourth quarter of 2005. In 2004 Nasdaq released a sublease loss reserve of $1.9 million, net of rental payments, in the third quarter of 2004, on leased property in Rockville, Maryland. Nasdaq management re-evaluated its decision to vacate this space and decided instead to sell a building owned by Nasdaq. We recorded a charge of $7.4 million in the fourth quarter of 2004 for the write-down of this building to fair market value. Nasdaq began marketing the building for sale in the fourth quarter of 2004 and completed the sale of the building in June 2005. Further contributing to the decrease in general and administrative expense was a $2.6 50 Table of Contents million loss recorded in the fourth quarter of 2004 on a lease transaction for certain of Nasdaq technology equipment. Partially offsetting the decrease in general and administrative expense was a $1.8 million charge recorded in the third quarter of 2005 for the change in the fair market value on the amount of additional payment to NASD for Nasdaq Series C Cumulative Preferred Stock, a $7.4 million loss recorded on the restructuring of the $240.0 million convertible notes in April 2005 in connection with the financing of the INET acquisition and a $1.1 million loss recorded on the early extinguishment of Nasdaq $25.0 million senior notes also in connection with the financing of the INET acquisition. See Note 3, Business Combinations, Note 4, 2005 and 2004 Cost Reductions and Strategic Review, Note 7, Debt Obligations, and Note 11, Related Party Transactions, to the consolidated financial statements for further discussion. The increase in general and administrative expense in 2004 was primarily due to the sublease losses recorded for the space at Nasdaq headquarters, the write-down of the owned building to its fair market value and the loss on a lease transaction for certain of Nasdaq technology equipment all discussed above. These increases were partially offset by the release of the sublease loss reserve on leased property in Rockville, Maryland, lower overall spending in 2004 as a result of Nasdaq cost reduction plan and losses from Nasdaq equity investment in Nasdaq LIFFE Markets, LLC, or NQLX, recorded in the first and second quarters of 2003. On July 24, 2003, Nasdaq redeemed its interest in the NQLX joint venture and transferred its ownership interest to London International Financial Futures Exchange, or LIFFE. See Elimination of Non-Core Product Lines, Initiatives and Severance section below for further discussion. Elimination of Non-Core Product Lines, Initiatives and Severance Strategic Review In the second quarter of 2003, we initiated a strategic review, which included the elimination of non-core product lines and initiatives and resulted in a reduction in our workforce. The strategic review of our operations was designed to position us for improved profitability and growth. In 2003, we recorded a total pre-tax charge to earnings of $145.5 million. The net impact to us was a total pre-tax charge of $143.5 million. The difference represented charges absorbed by minority shareholders of Nasdaq Europe. The charge recorded reflects the completion of the charges associated with our strategic review. As shown in the following table, the total charge of $145.5 million included $97.9 million from continuing operations and $47.6 million from discontinued operations related to Nasdaq Europe and IndigoMarkets Ltd. Nasdaq completed the sale of IndigoMarkets on September 30, 2003 and completed the transfer of Nasdaq interest in Nasdaq Europe on December 18, 2003. See Note 19, Discontinued Operations, to the consolidated financial statements for further discussion. 51 Table of Contents The following table summarizes the strategic review charge included in the Consolidated Statements of Income: Year Ended December 31, 2003 (in millions) Continuing Operations Non-Core Product Lines and Initiatives: Impairment of capitalized software and fixed assets $ 21.1 Impairment of goodwill and intangible assets 8.2 Contract cancellations 11.4 Other exit costs 11.6 Total non-core product lines and initiatives 52.3 Severance and benefit costs 32.4 Loss on early extinguishment of debt 13.2 Total continuing operations strategic review charge $ 97.9 Discontinued Operations Nasdaq Europe: Impairment of technology platform $ 29.4 Severance and benefit costs 2.5 Impairment of goodwill 8.1 Other exit costs including contract cancellations 8.2 Total Nasdaq Europe 48.2 Gain on disposition of IndigoMarkets (0.6 ) Total discontinued operations strategic review charge $ 47.6 Total strategic review charge $ 145.5 Continuing Operations Non-core product lines and initiatives included in the strategic review were: Primex Primex was an electronic auction system. Nasdaq ended its exclusive rights agreement with Primex Trading N.A., L.L.C. on December 31, 2003. Nasdaq decided to consolidate our trading services to a common functionality within the SuperMontage system and ceased offering Primex effective January 16, 2004. Nasdaq Tools Nasdaq Tools was an order management system that ran on the Nasdaq Application Programming Interface using the Nasdaq Workstation II and was wound-down throughout 2003. Nasdaq Tools was previously our wholly-owned subsidiary and was merged with and into us on July 31, 2002. NQLX NQLX was a joint venture with LIFFE to create a market for single stock futures and other futures products. On July 24, 2003, Nasdaq redeemed our interest in the NQLX joint venture and transferred its ownership interest to LIFFE. LIFFE assumed financial and management responsibility for NQLX. This change did not have any impact on the operation of NQLX, but usage of the Nasdaq brand by the company ceased. The Bulletin Board Exchange ( BBX ) BBX was a proposed platform for companies not eligible for the Nasdaq SmallCap Market to raise equity capital and increase the visibility of their stock. OTCBB continued its existing operations. 52 Table of Contents Liquidity Tracker Liquidity Tracker was an automated order routing system designed to allow traders to direct orders to specific market makers based on recent trading activity. Liquidity Tracker ceased operations as of June 30, 2003. MarketSite Tower MarketSite Tower is located at our Times Square, New York location. The video wall portion of the Tower was deemed impaired. The charge related to the elimination of the above non-core products and initiatives was approximately $52.3 million in 2003. Included in the charge was the reduction of our investment in NQLX of $6.3 million due to the redemption of our interest in the NQLX joint venture, the impairment of goodwill of $4.1 million associated with Nasdaq Tools, the impairment of certain intangible assets of $4.1 million, impairment of various capitalized software and fixed assets of $21.1 million, contract cancellations of $11.4 million and other costs of $5.3 million. Included in the $21.1 million impairment of various capitalized software and fixed assets is a $12.3 million impairment on the MarketSite Tower. See Valuation of Long-Lived Assets, of Note 2, Summary of Significant Accounting Policies, to the consolidated financial statements for further discussion. The remaining impairment of capitalized software and fixed assets relates to the eliminated products specifically Nasdaq Tools, Primex, BBX and Liquidity Tracker. In addition, the recorded charges from continuing operations included severance costs of $32.4 million and the loss on early extinguishment of long-term debt of $13.2 million. The severance costs included $13.8 million related to the reductions in force of 329 employees. The remaining $18.6 million of severance costs relate to the fulfillment of employment contracts and obligations associated with the retirement and departure of certain members of senior management. Total headcount was 956 as of December 31, 2003 versus 1,227 as of December 31, 2002 (excluding 48 employees in discontinued operations). The extinguishment of debt costs relate to the redemption of $150.0 million in aggregate principal amount of our 5.83% senior notes due 2007, or the $150.0 million senior notes. In conjunction with our strategic review, we reassessed our capital needs and determined that we no longer needed the liquidity of the $150.0 million senior notes. Discontinued Operations Discontinued operations included in the strategic review were: Nasdaq Europe Nasdaq Europe was a pan-European stock market licensed in Belgium. See below for complete discussion of the wind-down and eventual transfer of shares of Nasdaq Europe. IndigoMarket s IndigoMarkets was a joint venture with SSI Limited, or SSI, to develop international trading platforms. On September 30, 2003, Nasdaq Global, a former Nasdaq subsidiary, sold its interest in the joint venture to SSI and recognized a gain on the sale of approximately $0.6 million. Europe As a result of the strategic review, Nasdaq supported the closing of the market operated by Nasdaq Europe, in which Nasdaq owned a 63.0% interest through December 18, 2003. At an Extraordinary General Meeting held on June 26, 2003, the shareholders of Nasdaq Europe voted to discontinue operations of the market and, as a result, market operations were wound-down pursuant to a Transition Plan approved by the Belgian Banking and Finance Commission. As Nasdaq Europe was winding-down its market operations, Nasdaq reached an agreement to transfer all of Nasdaq shares in Nasdaq Europe to one of that company original investors; the cash consideration for the transaction was nominal. The transfer of Nasdaq shares of Nasdaq Europe was completed on December 18, 2003. The entity ceased using the Nasdaq Europe name after the transaction. As part of the transaction, Nasdaq Europe new owner committed to seek to restructure that company obligations and, in that context, to request from certain major creditors releases of any claims they might have against Nasdaq Europe former directors, officers and shareholders (if such claims are related to Nasdaq prior ownership interest in Nasdaq Europe). 53 Table of Contents At the time of the transfer, Nasdaq Europe had $15.1 million of external debt, accrued interest and other liabilities. Nasdaq recorded liabilities of $15.1 million that management believed were sufficient to satisfy any potential claims against Nasdaq. Nasdaq and Easdaq SA/NV, or Easdaq, formerly known as Nasdaq Europe, entered into an agreement dated as of October 27, 2004, providing in relevant part that Easdaq was to reach agreements with certain of its creditors to settle these creditors existing claims against Easdaq. On November 9, 2004, Nasdaq was provided evidence that these claims (related to Nasdaq prior ownership interest in Nasdaq Europe) of certain Easdaq creditors were satisfied or otherwise settled without any liability for Nasdaq. Nasdaq was the third party beneficiary of these creditor agreements and in the fourth quarter of 2004 released the $15.1 million reserve it maintained in connection with such claims and liabilities. The release of the reserve was recorded as income from discontinued operations in the Consolidated Statements of Income. Also, as part of Nasdaq strategic review, during the third quarter of 2003, Nasdaq supported Nasdaq Europe position in favor of the decision of the shareholders of Nasdaq Deutschland AG, or Nasdaq Deutschland, a German exchange in which Nasdaq Europe had a 50.0% interest, to suspend that company trading operations effective August 29, 2003. Nasdaq Europe transferred all of its shares in Nasdaq Deutschland to one of the other shareholders, BWB Holding AG, as of August 29, 2003. All shareholders of Nasdaq Deutschland agreed to release and discharge each other from certain claims that they may have had against each other in connection with certain agreements related to the operations and control of Nasdaq Deutschland. The charge related to the orderly wind-down and liquidation of market operations in Belgium and Germany was approximately $48.2 million (excluding the minority interest benefit of $2.0 million) for the year ended December 31, 2003. The $48.2 million charge includes the $29.4 million impairment of certain technology platforms held-for-sale and owned by Nasdaq Europe, the impairment of goodwill of $8.1 million (Nasdaq Europe and Nasdaq Deutschland), severance costs of $2.5 million and other costs of $8.2 million including contract cancellations. During the third quarter of 2003, the losses incurred by Nasdaq Europe exceeded the minority shareholders interests. Therefore, once the minority shareholders reached this point, Nasdaq absorbed 100.0% of Nasdaq Europe losses and strategic review charges. Nasdaq Japan Impairment Loss During the second quarter of 2002, we recognized an other-than-temporary impairment charge on our equity investment in Nasdaq Japan of $15.2 million. Nasdaq Japan entered into liquidation status in late November 2002 and was completely dissolved in May 2003. During the second quarter of 2003, we reversed $5.0 million of the reserves related to Nasdaq Japan due to favorable contract negotiations and lower legal costs resulting from the complete liquidation of Nasdaq Japan. Support Costs From Related Parties, net Support costs from related parties, net were $41.8 million, $45.6 million and $61.5 million for the year ended December 31, 2005, 2004 and 2003, respectively, a decrease of $3.8 million, or 8.3%, in 2005 compared with 2004 and a decrease of $15.9 million, or 25.9%, in 2004 compared with 2003. These decreases primarily reflect a reduction in surveillance and other regulatory charges from NASDR primarily due to NASD review and allocation of expenses among the markets and members it regulates. The decrease in 2005 was also due to the transfer of ownership of the OTCBB to NASD which reduced the associated regulatory costs. Also contributing to the decrease in 2004 was lower depreciation charges as certain technology assets were fully depreciated during the year ended December 31, 2003. Net Interest Expense Net interest expense was $7.6 million, $5.6 million and $9.0 million for the year ended December 31, 2005, 2004 and 2003, respectively, an increase of $2.0 million, or 35.7%, in 2005 compared with 2004 and a decrease 54 Table of Contents of $3.4 million, or 37.8%, in 2004 compared with 2003. The increase in 2005 was primarily due to additional interest expense from the $205.0 million convertible notes issued in April 2005 and from the $750.0 million senior term debt issued in December 2005, in connection with the financing of the INET acquisition. We recorded interest expense on the $750.0 million senior term debt since the date of the INET acquisition, December 8, 2005, through December 31, 2005. Interest expense in 2006 on the $750.0 million senior term debt will be significantly higher than the amount recorded in December 2005. The increase was partially offset by interest income earned on the proceeds from the issuance of the $205.0 million convertible notes, which was held in a restricted cash account from April 22, 2005 through December 8, 2005, and a lower interest coupon rate on the $240.0 million convertible notes. The decrease in net interest expense in 2004 was primarily due to a decrease in interest expense as a result of the redemption of outstanding debt in the third quarter of 2003. On September 30, 2003, Nasdaq redeemed the $150.0 million senior notes. Interest expensed and paid under these notes totaled approximately $6.5 million for the year ended December 31, 2003. In addition, interest income also decreased in 2004 due to the acquisition of Brut. Nasdaq used funds from available cash and investments to finance both the redemption of the notes and acquisition of Brut. See Note 3, Business Combinations, and Note 7, Debt Obligations, to the consolidated financial statements for further discussion. Income Taxes Nasdaq income tax provision was $44.6 million and $0.7 million for the year ended December 31, 2005 and 2004, respectively, compared with an income tax benefit of $21.2 million for the year ended December 31, 2003. The overall effective tax rate in 2005, 2004 and 2003 was 41.9%, 29.3% and 32.0%, respectively. The change in Nasdaq tax provision in 2005 compared with 2004 was primarily due to a loss on the restructuring of the $240.0 million convertible notes, a portion of which is not deductible for U.S. income tax purposes. In addition, in 2004 the effective tax rate was reduced by the realization of research and development tax credits as well as a reduction of a valuation allowance related to a foreign net operating loss carryforward. The change in Nasdaq tax provision (benefit) in 2004 compared with 2003 was primarily due to a reduction of a valuation allowance related to a foreign net operating loss carryforward. The effective tax rate may vary from period to period depending on, among other factors, the geographic and business mix of earnings and losses. These same and other factors, including history of pre-tax earnings and losses, are taken into account in assessing the ability to realize deferred tax assets. Liquidity and Capital Resources Nasdaq Treasury department manages Nasdaq capital structure, funding, liquidity, collateral and relationships with bankers, investment advisors and creditors. The Nasdaq Board of Directors approved an investment policy for Nasdaq and its subsidiaries for internally and externally managed portfolios. The goal of the policy is to maintain adequate liquidity at all times and to fund current budgeted operating and capital requirements and to maximize returns. All securities must meet credit rating standards as established by the policy and must be denominated in subsidiary specific currencies. The investment portfolio duration must not exceed 18 months. As of October 2003, the policy prohibits the purchasing of any investment in equity securities. The policy also prohibits any investment in debt interest in an entity that derives more than 25.0% of its gross revenue from the combined broker-dealer and/or investment advisory businesses of all of its subsidiaries and affiliates. Nasdaq investment policy is reviewed annually and was re-approved by the Board on January 17, 2006. Nasdaq also periodically reviews its investments and investment managers. Cash and cash equivalents and available-for-sale investments totaled $344.6 million as of December 31, 2005 compared with $233.1 million at December 31, 2004, an increase of $111.5 million, or 47.8%. This increase was primarily due to the receipt of funds from employee stock options exercises, the sale of the Key West building to NASD, and positive cash flows generated from operations. Partially offsetting these increases 55 Table of Contents were the payment for the partial redemption of Nasdaq Series C Cumulative Preferred Stock and payments made for the acquisitions of INET and Carpenter Moore. See Note 3, Business Combinations, Note 4, 2005 and 2004 Cost Reductions and Strategic Review, Note 11, Related Party Transactions, and Note 12, Capital Stock, to the consolidated financial statements for further discussion. Also in February 2006, Nasdaq raised proceeds from a public offering and redeemed our Series C Cumulative Preferred Stock, which increased our cash and cash equivalents balance. See Note 20, Subsequent Events, to the consolidated financial statements for further discussion. Operating Activities We rely primarily on cash flows from continuing operations to provide working capital for current and future operations. Cash flows from continuing operating activities totaled $120.9 million, $117.0 million and $145.8 million in 2005, 2004 and 2003, respectively. Cash inflows are primarily due to cash received from customers less cash paid to suppliers, employees and related parties. The increase in operating cash flows in 2005 as compared to 2004 was primarily due to an increase in net income. The decrease in operating cash flows for year ended December 31, 2004 as compared to 2003 was primarily due to a decrease in revenues partially offset by lower expenses and lower non-cash items included in net income. Investing and Financing Activities Cash used in investing activities was $953.4 million, $201.3 million and $0.2 million in 2005, 2004 and 2003, respectively. The increase in cash used in investing activities in 2005 as compared with 2004 was primarily due to the acquisitions of INET and Carpenter Moore completed during 2005. We paid $934.5 million and direct acquisition costs for of $34.3 million for INET and paid $27.5 million for Carpenter Moore. In 2004, we acquired Brut for $190.0 million, plus post-closing adjustments. See Note 3, Business Combinations, to the consolidated financial statements for further discussion. During 2005, we purchased $591.6 million of available-for-sale investments and $32.0 million of held-to-maturity investments. Capital expenditures and proceeds from sales of property and equipment were $25.4 million and $18.0 million, respectively, in 2005. Investing activities also included proceeds of $585.4 million and $62.7 million from the redemption and maturities of available-for-sale investments and held-to-maturity investments, respectively, in 2005. The increase in cash used in investing activities in 2004 as compared to 2003 was primarily due to the acquisition of Brut. During 2004, Nasdaq purchased $235.2 million of available-for-sale investments and $29.1 million of held-to-maturity investments. Capital expenditures and proceeds from sales of property and equipment were $26.0 million and $11.3 million, respectively, in 2004. Investing activities in 2004 also included proceeds of $240.9 million from the redemption of available-for-sale investments and $26.8 million from the maturities of held-to-maturity investments. During 2003, we purchased $179.2 million of available-for-sale investments and $18.5 million of held-to-maturity investments. Capital expenditures for property and equipment were $31.6 million in 2003. Investing activities in 2003 also included proceeds of $212.7 million from the redemption of available-for-sale investments and $18.6 million from the maturities of held-to-maturity investments. In 2003, we contributed $2.5 million to Nasdaq LIFFE joint venture. Cash provided by (used in) financing activities was $939.5 million, $(6.5) million and $(157.6) million in 2005, 2004 and 2003, respectively. The increase in 2005, as compared with 2004 was primarily due to the issuances of the $750.0 million senior term debt issued in December 2005 and the $205.0 million convertible notes in April 2005 partially offset by the partial redemption of Nasdaq Series C Cumulative Preferred Stock and the redemption of the $25.0 million senior notes. See Note 7, Debt Obligations, Note 11, Related Party Transactions, and Note 12, Capital Stock, to the consolidated financial statements for further discussion. Also in 2005, Nasdaq received proceeds from the issuances of common stock, primarily from employee stock option exercises. The decrease in 2004 as compared with 2003 was primarily due to the redemption of Nasdaq $150.0 million senior notes on September 30, 2003. In conjunction with its strategic review, Nasdaq reassessed its capital needs and determined that it no longer needed the liquidity of these senior notes. See Elimination of Non-Core Product Lines, Initiatives and Severance section above for further discussion. Financing activities in 56 Table of Contents 2005, 2004 and 2003 also consisted of payments of preferred stock dividends to NASD of $3.2 million, $8.4 million and $8.3 million, respectively. At December 31, 2005, none of Nasdaq lenders were affiliated with Nasdaq, except to the extent, if any, that H&F and SLP would be deemed affiliates of Nasdaq due to their ownership of the $240.0 million convertible notes and $205.0 million convertible notes and associated warrants. See Note 7, Debt Obligations, to the consolidated financial statements for further discussion. Capital Resources and Working Capital Working capital (calculated as current assets, reduced for held-to-maturity investments classified as current assets, less current liabilities) was $271.6 million at December 31, 2005 compared with $169.3 million at December 31, 2004, an increase of $102.3 million, or 60.4%. This increase was primarily due to additional receivables acquired in connection with the INET and Carpenter Moore acquisitions, an increase in revenues and an increase in cash and cash equivalents as discussed above. Nasdaq has been able to generate sufficient funds from operations to meet working capital requirements. Except for the un-drawn $75.0 million five-year revolving line of credit obtained in connection with the financing of the INET acquisition, we do not have any lines of credit. We believe that the liquidity provided by existing cash and cash equivalents, investments and cash generated from operations will provide sufficient capital to meet current and future operating requirements. In conjunction with the issuance of the $750.0 million senior term debt, Nasdaq prepaid in full the $25.0 million senior notes and recorded a loss on the early extinguishment of debt of the $25.0 million senior notes of approximately $1.1 million which is recorded in general and administrative expense in the Consolidated Statements of Income. See Note 7, Debt Obligations, to the consolidated financial statements for further discussion. Nasdaq will continue to explore alternative sources of financing that may increase liquidity in the future. On February 15, 2005, we issued 7,000,000 shares in a public offering of our common stock, and received net proceeds of $268.9 million. We used $104.7 million of these proceeds to redeem our Series C Cumulative Preferred Stock, which is described in more detail below. We plan to use the remaining proceeds for general corporate purposes, including potential acquisitions. See Note 20, Subsequent Events, to the consolidated financial statements for further discussion. Broker Dealer Net Capital Requirements Our broker-dealer subsidiaries, Brut, INET ATS and Island Execution Services, LLC, are subject to regulatory requirements intended to ensure their general financial soundness and liquidity, which require that they comply with certain minimum capital requirements. As of December 31, 2005, Brut was required to maintain minimum net capital of $0.3 million and had total net capital of approximately $6.7 million or $6.4 million in excess of the minimum amount required. As of December 31, 2005, Island Execution Services was required to maintain minimum net capital of $1.0 million and had total net capital of approximately $1.5 million or $0.5 million in excess of the minimum amount required. As of December 31, 2005, INET ATS was required to maintain minimum net capital of $1.0 million and had a net capital deficiency of approximately $48.0 million or $49.0 million below the minimum amount required. This deficiency was due to INET ATS investment in a non-U.S. based money market fund that is not registered under the Investment Company Act of 1940. Accordingly, the balances in the fund are a non-allowable asset under SEC Rule 15c3-1, the net capital rule. INET ATS provided hind-sight notice that the net capital was below the minimum amount required under the net capital rule. On February 8, 2006, the funds were redeemed and invested in a money market fund registered under the Investment Company Act of 1940, which corrected the net capital deficiency position. No funds were lost and no customers suffered any loss. 57 Table of Contents Quantitative and Qualitative Disclosures about Market Risk Market risk represents the risks of changes in the value of a financial instrument, derivative or non-derivative, caused by fluctuations in interest rates and equity prices. Our primary market risk is associated with fluctuations in interest rates and the effects that such fluctuations may have on our investment portfolio and outstanding debt. At December 31, 2005, investments consist of fixed income instruments with an average duration of 0.3 years. Our primary investment objective in debt securities is to preserve principal while maximizing yields, without significantly increasing risk. At December 31, 2005, our $205.0 million convertible notes and $240.0 million convertible notes specify a fixed interest rate until October 22, 2012 and for Nasdaq $750.0 million senior term debt a floating interest rate until maturity in 2011. These investment securities and outstanding debt obligations are subject to interest rate risk and their fair values may fluctuate with changes in interest rates. Management does not believe that a 100 basis point fluctuation in market interest rates will have a material effect on the carrying value of our investment portfolio or outstanding debt obligations at December 31, 2005. However, the fair value of Nasdaq debt obligations exceeds its carrying value as discussed in Note 14, Fair Value of Financial Instruments. Nasdaq does not currently hedge any variable interest rates on either the investment portfolio or debt obligations. At December 31, 2005, we had no significant foreign currency exposure or related hedges. We periodically reevaluate our hedging policies and may choose to enter into future transactions. We are exposed to credit risk from third parties, including customers, counterparties and clearing agents. These parties may default on their obligations to us due to bankruptcy, lack of liquidity, operational failure or other reasons. In particular, our subsidiaries, Brut and INET, may be exposed to credit risk, due to the default of trading counterparties, in connection with the external routing and agency brokerage services Brut and INET provide their customers. While we are not exposed to counterparty risk for trades executed on The Nasdaq Market Center, we are exposed to counterparty risk in connection with trades executed on or through the Brut ECN and INET ECN systems, or Brut and INET System Trades, given that Brut and INET, act as central counterparty on an agency basis for these trades. Brut System Trades in Nasdaq-listed securities and NYSE-listed securities routed to the NYSE DOT system with broker-dealer clients are cleared by Brut, as a member of the National Securities Clearing Corporation, or NSCC. Brut System Trades with non-broker-dealer customers were cleared by Merrill Lynch Professional Clearing Corporation pursuant to a clearing agreement. Effective December 31, 2005, Brut no longer participates in non-broker-dealer transactions. INET System Trades in Nasdaq-listed securities and NYSE-listed securities routed to the NYSE with broker-dealer clients are cleared pursuant to a clearing agreement with Instinet Clearing Services, Inc., or ICS. At December 31, 2005, INET did not have any non-broker-dealer customers. Pursuant to the rules of the NSCC and Brut clearing agreement, Brut is liable for any losses incurred due a counterparty or a clearing agent failure to satisfy its contractual obligations, either by making payment or delivering securities. Adverse movements in the prices of securities that are subject to these transactions can increase our credit risk. However, we believe that the risk of material loss is limited, as Brut customers are not permitted to trade on margin, NSCC rules limit counterparty risk on self-cleared transactions by establishing credit limit and capital deposit requirements for all brokers that clear with NSCC, and transactions with institutional customers are cleared only if the institutional customer delivers the appropriate securities or funds on the appropriate settlement date. Brut has never incurred a liability due to a customer failure to satisfy its contractual obligations as a counterparty to a Brut System Trade. Credit difficulties or insolvency or the perceived possibility of credit difficulties or insolvency of one or more larger or visible market participants could also result in market-wide credit difficulties or other market disruptions. We also have credit risk related to transaction fees that are billed to customers on a monthly basis, in arrears. Our potential exposure to credit losses on these transactions is represented by the receivable balances on our Consolidated Balance Sheets. Our customers are financial institutions whose ability to satisfy their contractual obligations may be impacted by volatile securities markets. Credit losses such as those described above could adversely affect our consolidated financial position and results of operations. 58 Table of Contents As a result of INET relationship with ICS, INET is exposed to substantial credit risk from both parties to a securities transaction during the period between the transaction date and the settlement date. Adverse movements in the prices of these securities can increase our credit risk. All of INET transactions and, consequently, the concentration of its credit exposure are with broker-dealers primarily located in the United States. INET seeks to control its credit risk through a variety of reporting and control procedures, including establishing credit limits and enforcing credit standards based upon a review of the counterparties financial condition and credit rating. INET monitors trading activity and collateral levels on a daily basis for compliance with regulatory and internal guidelines and obtains additional collateral, if appropriate. Contractual Obligations and Contingent Commitments Nasdaq has contractual obligations to make future payments under debt obligations by contract maturity, minimum rental commitments under non-cancelable operating leases and other obligations and has contingent commitments under a variety of arrangements. The following table shows these contractual obligations at December 31, 2005: Payments due by period Contractual Obligations Total Less than 1 year 1-3 years 3-5 years More than 5 years (in millions) Debt obligations by contract maturity (Note 7, Debt Obligations ) $ 1,195.0 $ 7.5 $ 15.0 $ 15.0 $ 1,157.5 Minimum rental commitments under non-cancelable operating leases, net (Note 16, Leases ) 237.6 33.2 44.5 37.4 122.5 Other obligations (Note 17, Commitments and Contingencies ) 26.8 14.8 9.3 2.7 Total $ 1,459.4 $ 55.5 $ 68.8 $ 55.1 $ 1,280.0 General Litigation We may be subject to claims arising out of the conduct of our business. Currently, there are various legal proceedings pending against us. One of these proceedings is a pending arbitration between Instinet and Archipelago. Nasdaq has become an interested party in this proceedings as a result of the INET acquisition. See Item 3. Legal Proceedings. We believe that any liabilities or settlements arising from these proceedings will not have a material effect on our consolidated financial position or our results of operations. Management is not aware of any unasserted claims or assessments that would have a material adverse effect on our consolidated financial position and results of operations. Credit Facility and Other INET Financing Arrangements Credit Facility . Nasdaq entered into a credit agreement, dated as of December 8, 2005. The credit agreement provides for up to $825.0 million of senior secured financing and is guaranteed by most of Nasdaq domestic subsidiaries. The $825.0 million available under the credit agreement includes: a six-year $750.0 million senior term loan facility; and a five-year $75.0 million revolving credit facility, with a letter of credit subfacility and swingline loan subfacility. We drew the full $750.0 million under the senior term loan facility on December 8, 2005, in order to fund a portion of Nasdaq consideration for the INET transaction. As of December 31, 2005, we had not drawn any funds under the revolving credit facility. 59 Table of Contents The interest rate on loans made under the revolving credit facility varies depending upon Nasdaq leverage ratio and LIBOR, and the interest rate on Nasdaq senior term loan facility is LIBOR plus 150 basis points. Accordingly, the interest rate will vary over time. As of December 31, 2005, borrowings under the credit facility bore interest at an average rate of 6.14% per annum. Nasdaq pays customary fees and expenses related to the credit facility, including a commitment fee of 0.50% per annum on the average daily unused portion of the revolving credit facility. The credit agreement contains customary covenants on Nasdaq and its subsidiaries including the following: maintenance of minimum interest expense coverage ratio and maximum leverage ratio as defined in the credit facility and pursuant to the following schedules: Interest Expense Coverage Ratio Period Ratio January 1, 2006 to September 30, 2006 2.75 to 1.00 October 1, 2006 to December 31, 2006 3.00 to 1.00 January 1, 2007 to March 31, 2007 3.25 to 1.00 April 1, 2007 to June 30, 2007 3.50 to 1.00 July 1, 2007 to September 30, 2007 3.75 to 1.00 October 1, 2007 to December 31, 2007 4.00 to 1.00 January 1, 2008 to March 31, 2008 4.25 to 1.00 April 1, 2008 to September 30, 2008 4.75 to 1.00 Thereafter 5.00 to 1.00 Leverage Ratio Period Ratio January 1, 2006 to March 31, 2006 5.75 to 1.00 April 1, 2006 to September 30, 2006 5.50 to 1.00 October 1, 2006 to December 31, 2006 5.00 to 1.00 January 1, 2007 to March 31, 2007 4.25 to 1.00 April 1, 2007 to June 30, 2007 4.00 to 1.00 July 1, 2007 to September 30, 2007 3.75 to 1.00 October 1, 2007 to December 31, 2007 3.50 to 1.00 January 1, 2008 to March 31, 2008 3.25 to 1.00 April 1, 2008 to December 31, 2008 3.00 to 1.00 January 1, 2009 to September 30, 2009 2.75 to 1.00 Thereafter 2.50 to 1.00 limitations on the payment of dividends and redemptions of our capital stock; limitations on loans, guarantees, investments, incurrence of debt and hedging arrangements; limitations on issuance and amendment of preferred stock and amendment of subordinated debt agreements; 60 Table of Contents prohibition of prepayments, redemptions and repurchases of debt other than debt under the credit facility; limitations on liens and sale-leaseback transactions; limitations on mergers, recapitalizations, acquisitions and asset sales; limitations on transactions with affiliates; limitations on restrictions on liens and other restrictive agreements; and limitations on changes in our business. The credit agreement also contains customary affirmative covenants, including access to financial statements, notice of certain events and defaults and maintenance of business and insurance, and events of default, as well as cross-defaults with both the $205.0 million convertible notes and $240.0 million convertible notes and associated warrants (discussed below) and any then outstanding subordinated debt. We are permitted to repay borrowings under the credit facility at any time in whole or in part, subject to our remaining in compliance with the covenants discussed above and our obligation to pay additional fees in certain circumstances. Beginning in 2007, we also are required to use a percentage of our excess cash flow, as defined in the credit agreement and calculated with respect to the prior fiscal year, to repay loans outstanding under the senior term loan facility. The percentage of cash flow we are required to use for repayments varies depending on our leverage ratio at the end of the year for which cash flow is calculated, with the maximum repayment percentage set at 50.0% of excess cash flow. Convertible Notes . On April 22, 2005, we entered into a securities purchase agreement with Norway Acquisition SPV, LLC, or Norway SPV, an affiliate of SLP and Hellman & Friedman, providing for the sale by us to Norway SPV of $205.0 million aggregate principal amount of 3.75% convertible notes due October 2012 and warrants to purchase 2,209,052 shares of our common stock at $14.50 per share. The $205.0 million convertible notes will be convertible into our common stock, subject to certain adjustments and conditions at a purchase price of $14.50 per share, which would equal 14,137,931 shares. The associated warrants will be exercisable by Norway SPV and its permitted transferees on or after April 22, 2006, or earlier under certain circumstances, and will terminate on December 8, 2008. Both the $205.0 million convertible notes and warrants and the shares underlying the $205.0 million convertible notes and warrants are not transferable without our consent until September 8, 2006. In addition, the $205.0 million convertible notes, warrants and the shares underlying the $205.0 million convertible notes and warrants can only be transferred pursuant to an exemption to the Securities Act or if they are registered under the Securities Act. The $205.0 million convertible notes and warrants purchased by Norway SPV are owned by SLP and Hellman & Friedman or their respective affiliates. On April 22, 2005, we also entered into a note amendment agreement with Hellman & Friedman, providing for the exchange by us of our $240.0 million aggregate principal amount of 4.0% convertible subordinated notes due 2006 for $240.0 million aggregate principal amount of 3.75% convertible notes due 2012 and, together with the $205.0 million convertible notes, the Notes, and Warrants (the warrants associated with the $240.0 million convertible notes and, together with the warrants associated with the $205.0 million convertible notes, the Warrants ) to purchase 2,753,448 shares of our common stock at $14.50 per share. The $240.0 million convertible notes will be convertible into our common stock, subject to certain adjustments and closing conditions, at a purchase price of $14.50 per share, which would equal 16,551,724 shares. The associated warrants will be exercisable by Hellman & Friedman and their permitted transferees on or after April 22, 2006, or earlier under certain circumstances, and will terminate on December 8, 2008. Both the $240.0 million convertible notes and warrants and the shares underlying the $240.0 million convertible notes and warrants are not transferable without our consent until September 8, 2006. In addition, the $240.0 million convertible notes and associated warrants and the shares underlying the $240.0 million convertible notes and warrants can only be transferred pursuant to an exemption to the Securities Act or if they are registered under the Securities Act. 61 Table of Contents The holders of the Notes and the Warrants are entitled to the benefits of a registration rights agreement among us, SLP and Hellman & Friedman commencing September 8, 2006. Under the registration rights agreement, we have agreed to file registration statements to cover the resale of the Notes or the common stock issuable upon conversion of the Notes or exercise of the Warrants at the request of the holders and grant rights to the holders to register their common stock if we file registration statements to register our common stock. In addition, our stockholders approved an amendment to our restated certificate of incorporation permitting the holders of the Notes to vote on all matters submitted to a vote of our stockholders. Under the terms of the amendment, each holder of the Notes is entitled to the number of votes equal to the number of shares of our common stock that could be acquired upon conversion of such holder Notes on the applicable record date, subject to the 5.0% voting limitation contained in our restated certificate of incorporation. The Notes are senior unsecured obligations of us and rank pari passu in right of payment with all existing and any future senior unsecured indebtedness of us and are senior in right of payment to any future subordinated indebtedness of us. The Notes will be convertible on and after April 22, 2006 (or earlier under certain circumstances) by their holders into our common stock at an initial conversion rate of 0.0689655 shares of our common stock per $1.00 principal amount of Notes, subject to adjustments, or, at our option, into cash and our common stock. We may redeem the Notes at any time after April 22, 2011 for a cash payment equal to the aggregate principal amount of the Notes plus any accrued and unpaid interest on the Notes, subject to the holders option to convert the Notes into our common stock after notice of such redemption is given. The indenture pursuant to which the Notes were issued is subject to customary events of default, including failure to make required payments, failure to comply with certain agreements or covenants, acceleration of certain other indebtedness rendering of final judgments for the payment of certain money, and certain events of bankruptcy and insolvency. Additionally, in connection with the issuance of the Notes and the Warrants, we entered into an amended and restated securityholders agreement with SLP and Hellman & Friedman. Under the terms of this agreement, SLP and Hellman & Friedman are each entitled to (i) have a representative appointed to our board of directors, (ii) obtain additional information about us and (iii) certain consultation and information rights; provided that SLP and its affiliates and Hellman & Friedman and its affiliates maintain ownership of a certain percentage of the Notes. Messrs. Glenn Hutchins and Patrick Healy are on our board of directors as a result of these provisions. Redemption of Series C Preferred Stock On February 15, 2006, we redeemed all outstanding shares of our Series C Cumulative Preferred Stock. We were required to redeem the Series C after the closing of our public offering of common stock, which took place on the same date. At the time of redemption, the Series C accrued dividends at an annual rate of 3.0%, which would have increased to 10.6% after July 1, 2006. The total redemption price was $104.7 million, which included accrued and unpaid dividends and a make-whole premium. We paid this entire amount to NASD, which was the sole holder of the Series C. As a result of the redemption, we are no longer bound by covenants contained in the Exchange Agreement between us and the NASD dated November 29, 2004. These covenants generally required us to obtain NASD consent before we could incur specified debt obligations or transfer assets. NASD will remain our controlling shareholder until we become operational as an exchange. Off-Balance Sheet Arrangements Nasdaq did not have any off-balance sheet arrangements as of December 31, 2005. Consolidation Trends in Industry The equity exchange industry provides services, including securities listing, market information and trade execution, both in the United States and internationally. There has been a recent wave of acquisitions in our 62 Table of Contents industry, particularly in the trade execution services area. This trend has been driven by a variety of business and regulatory factors. Broker-dealers are demanding greater efficiency in trading equity securities, new sophisticated order types and increased execution speed. At the same time, recent initiatives, including Regulation NMS, encourage a transition by all equity exchanges to electronic trading systems. Another driving factor is the focus on profitability from industry participants. As equity exchanges have demutualized and become for-profit public companies, they have focused on achieving economies of scale, improved technology and greater profitability through acquisitions. Recent acquisitions have resulted in the original entrepreneurial ECN entrants being absorbed by other players. As discussed above, we acquired the INET ECN in December 2005 and Brut in September 2004. The NYSE has also completed its acquisition of Archipelago. Since 2002, Archipelago merged with REDIBook ECN LLC and Instinet acquired The Island ECN Inc. This consolidation trend is also occurring in Europe. Many of the same forces that have led to consolidation in equity trade execution services are driving changes in other asset classes, such as equity options, where large volumes in trading of commoditized products reward scale efficiencies. The recent consolidation activity, including the NYSE merger with Archipelago, may intensify competition in both our Market Services and Issuer Services segments. New entrants may also increase competition. Our business has been and will continue to be impacted by the following key external factors: the number of companies seeking equity financing, which is affected by factors such as investor demand, the economy, alternative sources of financing, and tax policy; trading volumes in U.S. equity securities, which are driven primarily by overall macroeconomic conditions; competition (in terms of listings, market share, pricing, and product and service offerings); technological advancements; and regulatory developments, particularly the implementation of Regulation NMS. These factors may affect our future gross margin, revenues and net income. The merger between NYSE and Archipelago is causing changes to the competitive landscape. For a further discussion of competitive trends, see Business Competition. Regulation NMS Regulation NMS is scheduled to become effective in stages throughout 2006, although the SEC recently announced that it may delay its implementation. Regulation NMS will change the method for sharing market data revenues under our plans. The changes will introduce a quote component to the sharing methodology. Until the rule becomes effective, the revenue impact of the change is not completely predictable. Because Nasdaq is an active quoting exchange participant, the impact on our Nasdaq-listed revenue should be negligible. Nasdaq also receives a share of the data revenue that is generated in non-Nasdaq-listed securities because of our quoting and trading success in those securities. Additionally, due to our electronic nature, and thus our active quoting behavior in non-Nasdaq securities, the Regulation NMS-generated change in the sharing methodology may have a positive impact on Nasdaq share of the non-Nasdaq market data revenue. To the extent that our trading in NYSE securities increases, our share of the data revenue should also increase. A full discussion of the provisions of Regulation NMS in contained in the section entitled Business Regulation. Exchange Registration On January 13, 2006, the SEC approved our application for registration as a national securities exchange. We will begin operating as an exchange once we meet conditions imposed by the SEC, which we expect to occur 63 Table of Contents in the second quarter of 2006. We do not expect exchange registration to have a material impact on our financial or operating results. For a further discussion of exchange registration, including the conditions that we must meet, and the expected benefits, see Business Exchange Registration. Critical Accounting Policies The following provides information about our critical accounting policies. Critical accounting policies are defined as those that are reflective of significant judgments and uncertainties, and potentially result in materially different results under different assumptions and conditions. These policies relate to revenue recognition and cost of revenues, reserve for bad debts, valuation of goodwill and intangible assets, software costs and related party transactions. For a summary of our significant accounting policies, including the accounting policies discussed below, see Note 2, Summary of Significant Accounting Policies, to the consolidated financial statements for further discussion. Revenue Recognition and Cost of Revenues. Market Services revenues (74.3% of total revenues and 57.0 % of gross margin in 2005) are derived from Nasdaq Market Center and Nasdaq Market Services Subscriptions revenues. Nasdaq Market Center revenues are variable, based on service volumes, and recognized as transactions occur. Nasdaq Market Services Subscriptions revenues are based on the number of presentation devices in service and quotes delivered through those devices. Nasdaq Market Services Subscriptions revenues are recognized in the month that information is provided. These revenues are recorded net of amounts due under revenue sharing arrangements with market participants. Pursuant to EITF 99-19, execution revenues from transactions executed through both Brut and INET are recorded on a gross basis in revenues and expenses such as liquidity rebate payments are recorded in cost of revenues as Brut and INET act as principal. Prior to the second quarter of 2005, Nasdaq other execution revenues were reported net of liquidity rebates as Nasdaq does not act as principal. However, during and since the second quarter of 2005 under Nasdaq new Limitation of Liability Rule, Nasdaq, subject to certain caps, provides compensation for losses due to malfunctions of the order-execution systems of The Nasdaq Market Center. Therefore, pursuant to EITF 99-19, Nasdaq records all execution revenues from transactions executed through The Nasdaq Market Center on a gross basis in execution and trade reporting revenues and has records liquidity rebate payments as cost of revenues as Nasdaq now has certain risk associated with trade execution subject to rule limitations and caps. This rule change in fact was made on a prospective basis beginning April 1, 2005, as required under United States GAAP. This rule change did not have a material impact on the consolidated financial position or results of operations of Nasdaq in the second, third or fourth quarters of 2005. Issuer Services revenues (25.7% of total revenues and 43.0% of gross margin in 2005) include Corporate Client Group revenues and Nasdaq Financial Products revenues. Corporate Client Group revenues include annual fees, initial listing fees and listing of additional shares fees. Annual fees are recognized ratably over the following 12-month period. Initial listing and listing of additional shares fees are recognized on a straight-line basis over estimated service periods, which are six and four years, respectively, based on our historical listing experience. Corporate Client Group revenues also include commission income from Nasdaq Insurance Agency. Commission income is recognized when coverage becomes effective, the premium due under the policy is known or can be reasonably estimated, and substantially all required services related to placing the insurance have been provided. The effect on income of subsequent premium adjustments, including policy cancellations, is recorded when the adjustments is known. Fee income for services other than placement of insurance coverage is recognized as those services are provided. Broker commission adjustments and commissions on premiums billed directly by underwriters are recognized when such amounts can be reasonably estimated. For Nasdaq Financial Products revenues, we receive license fees for our trademark licenses that vary by product based on assets or number or underlying dollar value of contracts issued. Nasdaq primarily has two types of license agreements, transaction-based licenses and asset-based licenses. Transaction-based licenses are generally renewable long-term agreements. Customers are charged based on transaction volume or a minimum contract amount, or both. If a customer is charged based on transaction volume, Nasdaq recognizes revenue when the transaction occurs. If a customer is charged based on a minimum contract amount, Nasdaq recognizes revenue on a pro-rata basis over 64 Table of Contents the licensing term. Asset-based licenses are also generally long-term agreements. Customers are charged based on a percentage of assets under management for licensed products, per the agreement, on a monthly or quarterly basis. These revenues are recorded on a monthly or quarterly basis over the term of the license agreement. Reserve for Bad Debts. The reserve for bad debts is maintained at a level that management believes to be sufficient to absorb estimated losses in the accounts receivable portfolio. The reserve is increased by the provision for bad debts which is charged against operating results and decreased by the amount of charge-offs, net of recoveries. The amount charged against operating results is based on several factors including, but not limited to, a continuous assessment of the collectibility of each account, the length of time a receivable is past due and our historical experience with the particular customer. In circumstances where a specific customer inability to meet its financial obligations is known (i.e., bankruptcy filings), we record a specific provision for bad debts against amounts due to reduce the receivable to the amount we reasonably believe will be collected. Due to changing economic, business and market conditions, we review the reserve for bad debts monthly and make changes to the reserve through the provision for bad debts as appropriate. If circumstances change (i.e., higher than expected defaults or an unexpected material adverse change in a major customer ability to pay), our estimates of recoverability could be reduced by a material amount. Valuation of Goodwill and Intangible Assets. Our business acquisitions typically result in the recording of goodwill and other intangible assets, and the recorded values of those assets may become impaired in the future. As of December 31, 2005, goodwill totaled $961.9 million and intangible assets, net of accumulated amortization, totaled $215.5 million. The determination of the value of such intangible assets requires management to make estimates and assumptions that affect our consolidated financial statements. We assess potential impairments to intangible assets when there is evidence that events or changes in circumstances indicate that the carrying amount of an asset may not be recovered. Our judgments regarding the existence of impairment indicators and future cash flows related to intangible assets are based on operational performance of our acquired businesses, market conditions and other factors. Although there are inherent uncertainties in this assessment process, the estimates and assumptions we use are consistent with our internal planning. If these estimates or their related assumptions change in the future, we may be required to record an impairment charge on all or a portion of our goodwill and intangible assets. Impairment exists if the carrying value of the indefinite-lived intangible asset exceeds its fair value. For intangible assets subject to amortization, impairment is recognized if the carrying amount is not recoverable and the carrying amount exceeds the fair value of the intangible asset. Software Costs. We capitalize and amortize significant purchased application software and operational software that are an integral part of computer hardware on the straight-line method over their estimated useful lives, generally two to five years. We expense other purchased software as incurred. Nasdaq uses Statement of Position 98-1, Accounting for the Costs of Computer Software Developed or Obtained for Internal Use, for accounting for internally developed software. SOP 98-1 requires that certain costs incurred in connection with developing or obtaining internal use software be capitalized. We capitalize internal and third party costs incurred in connection with the development of internal use software. Related Party Transactions. Related party receivables and payables are the result of various transactions between us and our affiliates. Payables to related parties are comprised primarily of the regulation charge from NASDR. Receivables from related parties relates to cash disbursements funded by us on behalf of our affiliates. NASDR charges us for costs incurred related to Nasdaq market regulation and enforcement. Future Accounting Requirements In December 2004, the FASB issued Statement of Financial Accounting Standards 123 (revised 2004), Share-Based Payment, or, SFAS 123(R), which revises SFAS 123, Accounting for Stock-Based Compensation, or, SFAS 123, and supersedes Accounting Principles Board Opinion 25, Accounting for Stock Issued to Employees, or, APB 25. SFAS 123(R) also amended SFAS 95, Statement of Cash Flows. SFAS 123(R) requires that new, modified and unvested share-based payment transactions with employees, such as 65 Table of Contents stock options and restricted stock, be recognized in the financial statements based on their fair value and recognized as compensation expense over the vesting period. We adopted SFAS 123(R) effective January 1, 2006, using the modified prospective transition method, and will recognize share-based compensation cost on a straight-line basis over the requisite service periods of awards. Under the modified prospective method, non-cash compensation expense will be recognized for the portion of outstanding stock option awards granted prior to the adoption of SFAS 123(R) for which service has not been rendered, and for any future stock option grants. The pro forma information presented in Note 10, Stock Compensation and Stock Awards, presents the estimated compensation charges under SFAS 123(R). Nasdaq assessment of the estimated compensation charges is affected by the Company stock price as well as assumptions regarding a number of complex and subjective variables and the related tax impact. These variables include, but are not limited to, Nasdaq stock price volatility and employee stock option exercise behaviors. In 2004, the EITF issued EITF 03-1, The Meaning of Other-Than-Temporary Impairment and its Application to Certain Investments, to provide detailed guidance on assessing impairment losses on debt and equity investments. In September 2004, the FASB voted unanimously to delay the effective date of EITF 03-1. On November 3, 2005, the FASB issued FASB Staff Position FAS 115-1, The Meaning of Other-Than-Temporary Impairment and its Application to Certain Investments, revising the guidance in EITF 03-1, which did not have a material impact on Nasdaq consolidated financial statements. The disclosures required by EITF 03-1 are included in Note 5, Investments, to the consolidated financial statements.
