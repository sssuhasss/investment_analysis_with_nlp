Item 7. Management Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations This Management Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations, or MD&A, should be read in conjunction with our consolidated financial statements and notes thereto that appear elsewhere in this annual report on Form 10-K. See Risk Factors elsewhere in this annual report on Form 10-K for a discussion of certain risks associated with our business. The following discussion contains forward-looking statements. The forward-looking statements do not include the potential impact of any mergers, acquisitions, divestitures or other events that may be announced after the date hereof. Overview We provide cloud services for delivering, optimizing and securing content and business applications over the Internet. The key factors that influence our financial success are our ability to build on recurring revenue commitments for our performance and security offerings, increase media traffic on our network, develop new products and carefully manage our capital spending and other expenses. Revenue For most of our solutions, our customers commit to contracts having terms of a year or longer, which allows us to have a consistent and predictable base level of revenue. In addition to a base level of revenue, we are also dependent on media customers where usage of our services is more variable. As a result, our revenue is impacted by the amount of media and software download traffic we serve on our network, the rate of adoption of social media and video platform capabilities, the timing and variability of customer-specific one-time events and the impact of seasonal variations on our business. The ability to expand our product portfolio and to effectively manage the prices we charge for our services are also key factors impacting our revenue growth. We have observed the following trends related to our revenue in recent years: Increased sales of our security solutions have made a significant contribution to revenue growth, and we expect to continue our focus on security solutions in the future. We have experienced increases in the amount of traffic delivered for customers that use our solutions for video, gaming, social media and software downloads, contributing to an increase in our revenue. However, from the second half of 2015 onward, our traffic growth rates have moderated, primarily due to the do-it-yourself efforts by some of our customers that are among the large Internet platform companies: Amazon, Apple, Facebook, Google, Microsoft and Netflix. We refer to these companies as our Internet Platform Customers. Some of these customers have elected to develop and rely on their internal infrastructure to deliver more of their media content themselves rather than use our services. As a result, we are likely to continue experiencing lower revenue from these customers. We have not, however, been experiencing a significant shift to internal infrastructure usage across the remainder of our media services customer base. We have increased committed recurring revenue from our solutions by increasing sales of incremental services to our existing customers and adding new customers. These increases helped to limit the impact of reductions in usage of our services and contract terminations by certain customers, as well as the effect of price decreases negotiated as part of contract renewals. The unit prices paid by some of our customers have declined, reflecting the impact of competition. Our revenue would have been higher absent these price declines. We have experienced variations in certain types of revenue from quarter to quarter. In particular, we experience higher revenue in the fourth quarter of each year for some of our solutions as a result of holiday season activity. We also experience lower revenue in the summer months, particularly in Europe, from both e-commerce and media customers because overall Internet use declines during that time. In addition, we experience quarterly variations in revenue attributable to, among other things, the nature and timing of software and gaming releases by our customers using our software download solutions; whether there are large live sporting or other events that increase the amount of media traffic on our network; and the frequency and timing of purchases of custom services. 24 Table of Contents Expenses Our level of profitability is also impacted by our expenses, including direct costs to support our revenue such as bandwidth and co-location costs. We have observed the following trends related to our profitability in recent years: Network bandwidth costs represent a significant portion of our cost of revenue. Historically, we have been able to mitigate increases in these costs by reducing our network bandwidth costs per unit and investing in internal-use software development to improve the performance and efficiency of our network. Our total bandwidth costs may increase in the future as a result of expected higher traffic levels and serving more traffic from higher cost regions. We will need to continue to effectively manage our bandwidth costs to maintain current levels of profitability. Co-location costs are also a significant portion of our cost of revenue. By improving our internal-use software and managing our hardware deployments to enable us to use servers more efficiently, we have been able to manage the growth of co-location costs. We expect to continue to scale our network in the future and will need to continue to effectively manage our co-location costs to maintain current levels of profitability. Due to the fixed nature of some of our co-location and bandwidth costs over a minimum time period, it may not be possible to quickly reduce those costs. If our revenue growth rate declines, our profitability could decrease. Restructuring costs were significant in the fourth quarter of 2017, as management committed to an action to restructure certain parts of the company. The restructuring actions are expected to facilitate cost efficiencies and savings in 2018. Payroll and related compensation costs have grown in the past several years as we have increased headcount to support our revenue growth and strategic initiatives. We increased our headcount by 1,161 employees during the year ended December 31, 2017 , through hiring and from our acquisitions. During the year ended December 31, 2016 , we increased our headcount by 406 employees. We expect to continue to hire employees, both domestically and internationally, in support of our strategic initiatives, but at a slower pace than experienced in 2017. We anticipate our headcount growth during 2018, if any, to be modest given the elimination of over 300 positions in the first quarter of 2018 as part of our restructuring actions. Payroll and related compensation costs are expected to increase in 2018 as a result of the hiring completed throughout 2017. In recent years, we have used strategic acquisitions to complement and augment existing technological capabilities. During each of 2017 , 2016 and 2015 , we completed various acquisitions that, while immaterial to our financial results as a whole during those years, have contributed to increases in our revenue and level of expenses. 25 Table of Contents Results of Operations The following sets forth, as a percentage of revenue, consolidated statements of income data for the years indicated: 2017 2016 2015 Revenue 100.0 % 100.0 % 100.0 % Costs and operating expenses: Cost of revenue (exclusive of amortization of acquired intangible assets shown below) 35.0 34.6 33.0 Research and development 8.9 7.2 6.8 Sales and marketing 19.7 18.2 20.1 General and administrative 20.3 18.8 17.7 Amortization of acquired intangible assets 1.2 1.1 1.2 Restructuring charges 2.2 0.4 Total costs and operating expenses 87.3 80.3 78.8 Income from operations 12.7 19.7 21.2 Interest income 0.7 0.6 0.5 Interest expense (0.8 ) (0.8 ) (0.8 ) Other income (expense), net 0.2 (0.1 ) Income before provision for income taxes 12.6 19.7 20.8 Provision for income taxes 3.9 6.1 6.2 Net income 8.7 % 13.6 % 14.6 % Revenue Revenue during the periods presented is as follows (in thousands): For the Years Ended December 31, For the Years Ended December 31, 2017 2016 % Change % Change at Constant Currency 2016 2015 % Change % Change at Constant Currency Revenue $ 2,502,996 $ 2,340,049 7.0 % 7.0 % $ 2,340,049 $ 2,197,448 6.5 % 6.6 % The increase in our revenue from 2016 to 2017 was primarily the result of continued strong growth from our Cloud Security Solutions, which grew 32% year-over-year, and from new product introductions. Overall, however, the revenue growth rates for 2017 and 2016 have been negatively impacted by the "do-it-yourself" efforts of our Internet Platform Customers, some of which have developed internal infrastructure to deliver more of their media content themselves rather than rely on our media services. Revenue from these six customers in the aggregate declined from $250.5 million in 2016 to $202.9 million in 2017. The increase in our revenue from 2015 to 2016 was driven by higher demand for our services across all of our solutions and geographies, with particularly strong growth from our Cloud Security Solutions. The impact of the revenue decline from our Internet Platform Customers was particularly acute in 2016, declining to $250.5 million as compared to $379.3 million in 2015. We expect our revenue to increase in 2018 as compared to 2017 as a result of increased customer traffic delivered on our network, sales of incremental services to our existing customers and sales to new customers. 26 Table of Contents The following table quantifies the contribution to revenue during the periods presented from our divisions (in thousands). It is a customer-focused reporting view that reflects revenue we received from customers that are managed by the indicated division. For example, Media Division revenue represents all revenue received from customers that are predominately purchasing solutions from our media verticals (OTT video services, gaming, social media, etc.), including revenue from non-media solutions that those customers purchase. During 2017, the divisional categorization of certain customers was adjusted based on how those customer relationships were being managed. The historical presentation of divisional revenue was revised in order to reflect the most recent categorization and to provide a comparable view for all periods presented. During 2018, we plan to consolidate and manage our customers in two divisions: the Web Division and the Media and Carrier Division. For the Years Ended December 31, For the Years Ended December 31, 2017 2016 % Change % Change at Constant Currency 2016 2015 % Change % Change at Constant Currency Web Division $ 1,302,489 $ 1,132,858 15.0 % 15.0 % $ 1,132,858 $ 986,025 14.9 % 14.9 % Media Division 1,119,282 1,136,150 (1.5 ) (1.5 ) 1,136,150 1,157,016 (1.8 ) (1.7 ) Enterprise and Carrier Division 81,225 71,041 14.3 14.3 71,041 54,408 30.6 31.0 Total revenue $ 2,502,996 $ 2,340,049 7.0 % 7.0 % $ 2,340,049 $ 2,197,449 6.5 % 6.6 % The increase in Web Division revenue for 2017 as compared to 2016 was due to increased purchases of new solutions and upgrades to existing services by this customer base. Increased sales of our Cloud Security Solutions to Web Division customers, in particular our Kona Site Defender and Prolexic solutions, as well as our new Bot Manager, offering were a principal contributor to our overall revenue growth. The increase in Web Division revenue in 2016 as compared to 2015 was due to increased demand across most of our customer base particularly for our Cloud Security Solutions. The declines in the year-over-year revenue growth rate in Media Division revenue for 2017 as compared to 2016 , and 2016 as compared to 2015 , were primarily the result of decreased traffic from our Internet Platform Customers. The year-over-year revenue growth rate for other Media Division customers was 4% and 14% for the years ended December 31, 2017 and 2016 , respectively. The following table quantifies the contribution to revenue during the periods presented from our solution categories, which is a product-focused view that reflects revenue by solution purchased (in thousands): For the Years Ended December 31, For the Years Ended December 31, 2017 2016 % Change % Change at Constant Currency 2016 2015 % Change % Change at Constant Currency Performance and Security Solutions $ 1,542,558 $ 1,355,030 13.8 % 13.9 % $ 1,355,030 $ 1,158,281 17.0 % 17.3 % Media Delivery Solutions 738,916 787,179 (6.1 ) (6.2 ) 787,179 868,820 (9.4 ) (9.6 ) Services and Support Solutions 221,522 197,840 12.0 12.0 197,840 170,347 16.1 16.0 Total revenue $ 2,502,996 $ 2,340,049 7.0 % 7.0 % $ 2,340,049 $ 2,197,448 6.5 % 6.6 % The increases in Performance and Security Solutions revenue for 2017 as compared to 2016 , and 2016 as compared to 2015 , were due to new product introductions and increased demand across all major product lines, with especially strong growth in our Cloud Security Solutions. Cloud Security Solutions revenue for the year ended December 31, 2017 was $481.5 million , as compared to $364.9 million and $254.4 million for the years ended December 31, 2016 and 2015 , respectively. 27 Table of Contents The declines in Media Delivery Solutions revenue for 2017 as compared to 2016 , and 2016 as compared to 2015 , were primarily the result of decreased traffic from our Internet Platform Customers, resulting from their "do-it-yourself" efforts in delivering their content. During 2017 as compared to 2016, revenue from our Media Delivery Solutions for other customers remained flat. The increases in Services and Support Solutions revenue for 2017 as compared to 2016 , and 2016 as compared to 2015 , were due to strong attachment rates for our professional services for new customers as well as purchases of upgrades to professional services by our existing customers. The following table quantifies revenue derived in the U.S. and internationally (in thousands): For the Years Ended December 31, For the Years Ended December 31, 2017 2016 % Change % Change at Constant Currency 2016 2015 % Change % Change at Constant Currency U.S. $ 1,647,948 $ 1,620,724 1.7 % 1.7 % $ 1,620,724 $ 1,604,492 1.0 % 1.0 % International 855,048 719,325 18.9 18.9 719,325 592,956 21.3 21.6 Total revenue $ 2,502,996 $ 2,340,049 7.0 % 7.0 % $ 2,340,049 $ 2,197,448 6.5 % 6.6 % The reduced revenue from our Internet Platform Customers negatively impacted our U.S. revenue growth rates for the years ended December 31, 2017 and 2016, as these customers are based in the U.S. For the year ended December 31, 2017 , approximately 34% of our revenue was derived from our operations located outside of the U.S., compared to 31% for the year ended December 31, 2016 , and 27% for the year ended December 31, 2015 . No single country outside of the U.S. accounted for 10% or more of revenue during any of these periods. During 2017 and 2016, we continued to see strong revenue growth from our operations in the Asia Pacific region. Changes in foreign currency exchange rates negatively impacted our revenue by $0.4 million in 2017 as compared to 2016 , and by $1.0 million in 2016 as compared to 2015 . Cost of Revenue Cost of revenue consisted of the following for the periods presented (in thousands): For the Years Ended December 31, For the Years Ended December 31, 2017 2016 % Change 2016 2015 % Change Bandwidth fees $ 168,092 $ 168,202 (0.1 )% $ 168,202 $ 150,607 11.7 % Co-location fees 130,181 129,904 0.2 129,904 125,983 3.1 Network build-out and supporting services 75,209 61,320 22.7 61,320 58,207 5.3 Payroll and related costs 216,681 189,409 14.4 189,409 158,742 19.3 Stock-based compensation, including amortization of prior capitalized amounts 36,677 31,145 17.8 31,145 26,222 18.8 Depreciation of network equipment 143,825 140,777 2.2 140,777 130,098 8.2 Amortization of internal-use software 105,093 88,244 19.1 88,244 75,761 16.5 Total cost of revenue $ 875,758 $ 809,001 8.3 % $ 809,001 $ 725,620 11.5 % As a percentage of revenue 35.0 % 34.6 % 34.6 % 33.0 % 28 Table of Contents The increase in total cost of revenue for 2017 as compared to 2016 was primarily due to increases in: payroll and related costs, as well as stock-based compensation, due to increased hiring in our services team to support revenue growth; amounts paid for network build-out and supporting services related to investments in network expansion to support our expanding web performance and cloud security solutions as a result of new product launches and our acquisitions; and amortization of internal-use software as we continued to release internally-developed software onto our network as a result of new product launches and significant enhancements to our existing services. The increase in total cost of revenue for 2016 as compared to 2015 was primarily due to increases in: amounts paid to network providers for bandwidth fees to support the increase in traffic served on our network and for traffic served from higher cost regions; payroll and related costs, as well as stock-based compensation, due to increased hiring in our services team to support revenue growth; and depreciation of network equipment and amortization of internal-use software as we continued to invest in our infrastructure and release internally-developed software onto our network. We have long-term purchase commitments for co-location services and bandwidth usage with various vendors and network and Internet service providers. Our minimum commitments related to bandwidth usage and co-location services may vary from period to period depending on the timing and length of contract renewals with our service providers. See Note 12 to our consolidated financial statements included elsewhere in this annual report on Form 10-K for details regarding our bandwidth usage and co-location services purchase commitments. We believe that cost of revenue will increase during 2018 as compared to 2017 due to higher bandwidth expenses associated with increased customer traffic on our network and the costs we expect to incur to increase our network's capacity and resiliency with the goal of combating potential attacks on our platform. Additionally, during 2018 , we anticipate amortization of internal-use software development costs to increase as compared to 2017 , along with increased payroll and related costs associated with our professional services personnel and related expenses. However, we do not anticipate that cost of revenue will increase as a percentage of revenue during 2018 as compared to 2017. We plan to continue making investments in our network with the expectation that our customer base will continue to expand and that we will continue to deliver more traffic to existing customers. Research and Development Expenses Research and development expenses consisted of the following for the periods presented (in thousands): For the Years Ended December 31, For the Years Ended December 31, 2017 2016 % Change 2016 2015 % Change Payroll and related costs $ 322,604 $ 253,351 27.3 % $ 253,351 $ 220,198 15.1 % Stock-based compensation 38,863 29,739 30.7 29,739 23,926 24.3 Capitalized salaries and related costs (148,998 ) (122,084 ) 22.0 (122,084 ) (103,352 ) 18.1 Other expenses 9,965 6,622 50.5 6,622 7,819 (15.3 ) Total research and development $ 222,434 $ 167,628 32.7 % $ 167,628 $ 148,591 12.8 % As a percentage of revenue 8.9 % 7.2 % 7.2 % 6.8 % The increases in research and development expenses for 2017 as compared to 2016 and 2016 as compared to 2015, were due to increases in: payroll and related costs as a result of headcount growth to support investments in new product development and network scaling, and as a result of recent acquisitions; and stock-based compensation due to increased headcount and market adjustments of award sizes to existing employees due to competition for certain engineering talent. 29 Table of Contents The increases in research and development expenses for the periods presented above were partially offset by increases in capitalized salaries and related costs due to continued investment in internal-use software deployed on our network. Research and development costs are expensed as incurred, other than certain internal-use software development costs eligible for capitalization. Capitalized development costs consist of payroll and related costs for personnel and external consulting expenses involved in the development of internal-use software used to deliver our services and operate our network. For the years ended December 31, 2017, 2016 and 2015 , we capitalized $26.8 million , $21.4 million and $16.7 million , respectively, of stock-based compensation. These capitalized internal-use software development costs are amortized to cost of revenue over their estimated useful lives, which is generally two years. We believe that research and development expenses during 2018 will increase as compared to 2017 , as a result of the increases in headcount we experienced throughout 2017. We expect the increases to payroll and related costs in 2018 as compared to 2017 to be at a slower pace than we experienced in 2017. Sales and Marketing Expenses Sales and marketing expenses consisted of the following for the periods presented (in thousands): For the Years Ended December 31, For the Years Ended December 31, 2017 2016 % Change 2016 2015 % Change Payroll and related costs $ 354,829 $ 309,181 14.8 % $ 309,181 $ 316,845 (2.4 )% Stock-based compensation 60,247 55,407 8.7 55,407 53,542 3.5 Marketing programs and related costs 48,551 36,904 31.6 36,904 43,990 (16.1 ) Other expenses 30,005 25,475 17.8 25,475 26,611 (4.3 ) Total sales and marketing $ 493,632 $ 426,967 15.6 % $ 426,967 $ 440,988 (3.2 )% As a percentage of revenue 19.7 % 18.2 % 18.2 % 20.1 % The increase in sales and marketing expenses for 2017 as compared to 2016 was primarily due to increases in: payroll and related costs from headcount increases to enable our Web and Enterprise and Carrier Divisions' go-to-market strategies in support of growth opportunities; and marketing programs and related costs in support of our go-to-market strategies and ongoing geographic expansion. The decrease in sales and marketing expenses for 2016 as compared to 2015 was primarily due to a decrease in performance-based commissions earned and reduced spending on marketing programs and related costs as we moderated discretionary spending to align with our revenue growth rates. We believe that sales and marketing expenses will increase during 2018 as compared to 2017 , due to increased payroll and related costs as a result of headcount growth during 2017 and expected hiring in 2018. 30 Table of Contents General and Administrative Expenses General and administrative expenses consisted of the following for the periods presented (in thousands): For the Years Ended December 31, For the Years Ended December 31, 2017 2016 % Change 2016 2015 % Change Payroll and related costs $ 194,199 $ 163,348 18.9 % $ 163,348 $ 161,660 1.0 % Stock-based compensation 44,884 41,073 9.3 41,073 35,062 17.1 Depreciation and amortization 76,128 65,780 15.7 65,780 54,562 20.6 Facilities-related costs 80,452 72,549 10.9 72,549 64,302 12.8 Provision for doubtful accounts 3,209 1,235 159.8 1,235 1,717 (28.1 ) Acquisition-related costs 23,373 1,028 2,173.6 1,028 1,756 (41.5 ) License of patent (16,421 ) (8,577 ) 91.5 (8,577 ) (100.0 ) Professional fees and other expenses 103,341 103,480 (0.1 ) 103,480 69,206 49.5 Total general and administrative $ 509,165 $ 439,916 15.7 % $ 439,916 $ 388,265 13.3 % As a percentage of revenue 20.3 % 18.8 % 18.8 % 17.7 % The increase in total general and administrative expenses for 2017 as compared to 2016 was primarily due to increases in: payroll and related costs, specifically in our network infrastructure and information technology functions in support of our security infrastructure growth and network scaling and efficiency efforts; facilities-related costs and depreciation and amortization due to expansion of company infrastructure throughout 2016 and 2017 to support investments in engineering, go-to market capacity and enterprise expansion initiatives, particularly expansion of our facility footprint; and acquisition-related costs due to the release of an indemnification receivable related to an acquisition. The increase in total general and administrative expenses for 2016 as compared to 2015 was primarily due to increases in: legal and other professional fees due to ongoing litigation; expansion of company infrastructure throughout 2015 and 2016 to support investments in engineering, go-to market capacity and enterprise expansion initiatives, particularly expansion of our facility footprint, which increased facilities-related costs and depreciation and amortization; and stock-based compensation as a result of increased headcount and the impact that changing estimates have on performance-based stock-based compensation awards from period to period. General and administrative expenses for 2017 and 2016 are broken out by category as follows (in thousands): For the Years Ended December 31, For the Years Ended December 31, 2017 2016 % Change 2016 2015 % Change Global functions $ 201,539 $ 189,485 6.4 % $ 189,485 $ 160,019 18.4 % As a percentage of revenue 8.1 % 8.1 % 8.1 % 7.3 % Infrastructure 297,465 255,855 16.3 255,855 222,674 14.9 As a percentage of revenue 11.9 % 10.9 % 10.9 % 10.1 % Other 10,161 (5,424 ) (287.3 ) (5,424 ) 5,572 (197.3 ) Total general and administrative expenses $ 509,165 $ 439,916 15.7 % $ 439,916 $ 388,265 13.3 % As a percentage of revenue 20.3 % 18.8 % 18.8 % 17.7 % 31 Table of Contents Global functions expense includes payroll, stock-based compensation and other employee-related costs for administrative functions, including finance, purchasing, order entry, human resources, legal, information technology and executive personnel, as well as third-party professional service fees. Infrastructure expense includes payroll, stock-based compensation and other employee-related costs for our network infrastructure functions, as well as facility rent expense, depreciation and amortization of facility and IT-related assets, software and software-related costs, business insurance and taxes. Our network infrastructure function is responsible for network planning, sourcing, architecture evaluation and platform security. Other expenses includes acquisition-related costs, provision for doubtful accounts and the license of a patent . During 2018 , we expect payroll and related costs of our general and administrative functions to increase as compared to 2017 as a result of headcount growth in 2017. We do not expect other areas of general and administrative expenses to experience the same level of increases as past years and we expect acquisition-related costs to decrease as a result of the release of an indemnification receivable in 2017 that will not recur in 2018 that related to a prior acquisition. Amortization of Acquired Intangible Assets For the Years Ended December 31, For the Years Ended December 31, (in thousands) 2017 2016 % Change 2016 2015 % Change Amortization of acquired intangible assets $ 30,904 $ 26,642 16.0 % $ 26,642 $ 27,067 (1.6 )% As a percentage of revenue 1.2 % 1.1 % 1.1 % 1.2 % The increase in amortization of acquired intangible assets in 2017 as compared to 2016 was the result of amortization of assets related to our 2016 and 2017 acquisitions. The decrease in amortization of acquired intangible assets in 2016 as compared to 2015 was attributable to the finalization of amortization of intangible assets acquired in previous years; partially offset by intangible assets we acquired in 2015 and 2016. Based on acquired intangible assets as of December 31, 2017 , future amortization is expected to be approximately $33.3 million , $36.5 million , $33.8 million , $27.9 million and $22.4 million for the years ending December 31, 2018 , 2019 , 2020 , 2021 and 2022 , respectively. Restructuring Charges For the Years Ended December 31, For the Years Ended December 31, (in thousands) 2017 2016 % Change 2016 2015 % Change Restructuring charges $ 54,884 $ 10,301 432.8 % $ 10,301 $ 767 1,243.0 % As a percentage of revenue 2.2 % 0.4 % 0.4 % % The increase in restructuring charges in 2017 as compared to 2016 was the result of certain restructuring actions taken in the fourth quarter of 2017. Management committed to an action to restructure certain parts of the business, primarily media-related, with the intent of shifting focus to more critical areas and away from products that have not seen expected commercial success. The restructuring is also intended to facilitate other cost efficiencies and savings. Certain capitalized internal-use software charges have been realized for software not yet placed into service that will not be completed and launched due to this action. In addition, as part of cost efficiencies and savings, certain headcount and facility reductions were made. The restructuring charges in 2017 also consisted of severance expenses associated with the acquisitions of Soasta and Nominum. The restructuring charges in 2016 were primarily the result of changes to our organizational structure to reorganize and consolidate our products and development groups and global sales, services and marketing teams into divisions centered on our solutions. The restructuring charges relate to severance expenses for impacted employees and charges for internal-use software not yet placed into service that will not be completed and launched due to changing priorities as part of the reorganization. 32 Table of Contents The restructuring charges in 2015 consisted of severance expenses for redundant employees associated with acquisitions completed during those years. We expect to incur additional restructuring charges of up to $15.0 million in 2018 as a result of the action committed to in the fourth quarter of 2017 and continued in the first quarter of 2018. These charges will include severance and related expenses for terminations of approximately 300 employees in the first quarter of 2018 and charges related to facility closures we plan to implement in 2018. Non-Operating Income (Expense) For the Years Ended December 31, For the Years Ended December 31, (in thousands) 2017 2016 % Change 2016 2015 % Change Interest income $ 17,855 $ 14,702 21.4 % $ 14,702 $ 11,200 31.3 % As a percentage of revenue 0.7 % 0.6 % 0.6 % 0.5 % Interest expense $ (18,839 ) $ (18,638 ) 1.1 % $ (18,638 ) $ (18,525 ) 0.6 % As a percentage of revenue (0.8 )% (0.8 )% (0.8 )% (0.8 )% Other income (expense), net $ 887 $ 3,788 (76.6 )% $ 3,788 $ (2,201 ) (272.1 )% As a percentage of revenue % 0.2 % 0.2 % (0.1 )% For the periods presented, interest income primarily consists of interest earned on invested cash balances and marketable securities, and interest expense consists of the amortization of the debt discount and debt issuance costs related to our convertible senior notes issued in February 2014. Other income (expense), net for the years ended December 31, 2017 , 2016 and 2015 primarily represents net foreign exchange gains and losses mainly due to foreign currency exchange rate fluctuations on intercompany and other non-functional currency transactions. The fluctuation in other income (expense), net for 2016 ,as compared to 2015 also includes the impact of gains recognized on the disposition of certain cost method investments. Other income (expense), net may fluctuate in the future based on changes in foreign currency exchange rates or other events. Provision for Income Taxes For the Years Ended December 31, For the Years Ended December 31, (in thousands) 2017 2016 % Change 2016 2015 % Change Provision for income taxes $ 97,801 $ 143,314 (31.8 )% $ 143,314 $ 135,218 6.0 % As a percentage of revenue 3.9 % 6.1 % 6.1 % 6.2 % Effective income tax rate 30.9 % 31.2 % 31.2 % 29.6 % For the year ended December 31, 2017 , our effective income tax rate was lower than the federal statutory tax rate due to the composition of income from foreign jurisdictions that is taxed at lower rates compared to the statutory tax rates in the U.S., the re-measurement of deferred taxes at lower tax rates expected to be in place upon realization due to the U.S. Tax Cuts and Jobs Act, or TCJA, which was enacted in December 2017, the impacts of the release of an acquisition-related reserve due to the expiration of the relevant statute of limitations and U.S. federal, state and foreign research and development credits. These benefits were partially offset by a provisional charge for the one-time transition tax on the mandatory deemed repatriation of cumulative foreign earnings taken as part of the TCJA, the effects of stock-based compensation in accordance with authoritative guidance for share-based payments and state income taxes. For the year ended December 31, 2017, the net impact of the TCJA described above was a provisional net tax expense of $26.0 million which is comprised of a one-time transition tax expense of $43.4 million on the mandatory deemed repatriation of cumulative foreign earnings as of December 31, 2017, offset by a $17.4 million tax benefit related to the re-measurement of deferred tax assets and liabilities due to the lower corporate income tax rate. For the year ended December 31, 2016, our effective income tax rate was lower than the federal statutory tax rate due to the composition of income from foreign jurisdictions that is taxed at lower rates compared to the statutory tax rates in the U.S., the domestic production activities deduction and U.S. federal, state and foreign research and development credits, partially 33 Table of Contents offset by the effects of stock-based compensation in accordance with authoritative guidance for share-based payments and state income taxes. For the year ended December 31, 2015, our effective income tax rate was lower than the federal statutory tax rate due to the retroactive application of a U.S. tax court ruling with respect to the treatment of stock-based compensation in intercompany arrangements, U.S. federal, state, and foreign research and development credits, the domestic production activities deduction and the composition of income from foreign jurisdictions that is taxed at lower rates compared to the statutory tax rates in the U.S. These benefits were partially offset by the effects of accounting for stock-based compensation in accordance with the authoritative guidance for share-based payments and state income taxes. The decrease in the provision for income taxes for 2017 as compared to 2016 was mainly due to a decrease in profit before tax, the re-measurement of deferred taxes at lower tax rates expected to be in place upon realization as a result of the TCJA, the impacts of the release of an acquisition-related reserve due to the expiration of the relevant statute of limitations and an increase in U.S. federal, state and foreign research and development credits. These benefits were partially offset by a decrease in the domestic production activities deduction and a provisional charge for the one-time transition tax on the mandatory deemed repatriation of cumulative foreign earnings as a result of the TJCA. The increase in the provision for income taxes for 2016 as compared to 2015 was mainly due to the retroactive application of a U.S. tax court ruling with respect to the treatment of stock-based compensation on intercompany arrangements that occurred in 2015, a decrease in U.S. federal and state research and development credits and a change in the composition of income from foreign jurisdictions. This increase in the provision for income taxes was partially offset by an increase in the domestic production activities deduction. Our effective income tax rate may fluctuate between fiscal years and from quarter to quarter due to items arising from discrete events, such as tax benefits from the disposition of employee equity awards, settlements of tax audits and assessments and tax law changes. Our effective income tax rate is also impacted by, and may fluctuate in any given period because of, the composition of income in foreign jurisdictions where tax rates differ depending on the local statutory rates. Non-GAAP Financial Measures In addition to providing financial measurements based on accounting principles generally accepted in the U.S., or GAAP, we publicly discuss additional financial measures that are not prepared in accordance with GAAP, or non-GAAP financial measures. Management uses non-GAAP financial measures, in addition to GAAP financial measures, to understand and compare operating results across accounting periods, for financial and operational decision-making, for planning and forecasting purposes, to set executive compensation and to evaluate our financial performance. These non-GAAP financial measures are: non-GAAP income from operations, non-GAAP operating margin, non-GAAP net income, non-GAAP net income per diluted share, Adjusted EBITDA, Adjusted EBITDA margin and impact of foreign currency exchange rates, as discussed below. Management believes that these non-GAAP financial measures reflect our ongoing business in a manner that facilitates meaningful comparisons and analysis of trends in the business, as they assist in the comparison of financial results across accounting periods and to those of our peer companies. Management also believes that these non-GAAP financial measures enable investors to evaluate our operating results and future prospects in the same manner as management. These non-GAAP financial measures may exclude expenses and gains that may be unusual in nature, infrequent or not reflective of our ongoing operating results. The non-GAAP financial measures do not replace the presentation of our GAAP financial measures and should only be used as a supplement to, not as a substitute for, our financial results presented in accordance with GAAP. The non-GAAP adjustments, and our basis for excluding them from non-GAAP financial measures, are outlined below: Amortization of acquired intangible assets We have incurred amortization of intangible assets, included in our GAAP financial statements, related to various acquisitions we have made. The amount of an acquisition's purchase price allocated to intangible assets and the term of its related amortization can vary significantly and are unique to each acquisition; therefore, we exclude amortization of acquired intangible assets from our non-GAAP financial measures to provide investors with a consistent basis for comparing pre- and post-acquisition operating results. Stock-based compensation and amortization of capitalized stock-based compensation Although stock-based compensation is an important aspect of the compensation paid to our employees, the grant date fair value varies based 34 Table of Contents on the stock price at the time of grant, varying valuation methodologies, subjective assumptions and the variety of award types. This makes the comparison of our current financial results to previous and future periods difficult to evaluate; therefore, we believe it is useful to exclude stock-based compensation and amortization of capitalized stock-based compensation from our non-GAAP financial measures in order to highlight the performance of our core business and to be consistent with the way many investors evaluate our performance and compare our operating results to peer companies. Acquisition-related costs Acquisition-related costs include transaction fees, advisory fees, due diligence costs and other direct costs associated with strategic activities. In addition, subsequent adjustments to our initial estimated amounts of contingent consideration and indemnification associated with specific acquisitions are included within acquisition-related costs. These amounts are impacted by the timing and size of the acquisitions. We exclude acquisition-related costs from our non-GAAP financial measures to provide a useful comparison of our operating results to prior periods and to our peer companies because such amounts vary significantly based on the magnitude and quantity of our acquisition transactions. Restructuring charges We have incurred restructuring charges that are included in our GAAP financial statements, primarily related to workforce reductions and estimated costs of exiting facility lease commitments. We exclude these items from our non-GAAP financial measures when evaluating our continuing business performance as such items vary significantly based on the magnitude of the restructuring action and do not reflect expected future operating expenses. In addition, these charges do not necessarily provide meaningful insight into the fundamentals of current or historical operations of our business. Amortization of debt discount and issuance costs and amortization of capitalized interest expense In February 2014, we issued $690 million of convertible senior notes due 2019 with a coupon interest rate of 0%. The imputed interest rate of the convertible senior notes was approximately 3.2%. This is a result of the debt discount recorded for the conversion feature that is required to be separately accounted for as equity under GAAP, thereby reducing the carrying value of the convertible debt instrument. The debt discount is amortized as interest expense together with the issuance costs of the debt. All of our interest expense is comprised of these non-cash components and is excluded from management's assessment of our operating performance because management believes the non-cash expense is not representative of ongoing operating performance. Gains and losses on investments We have recorded gains and losses from the disposition and impairment of certain investments. We believe excluding these amounts from our non-GAAP financial measures is useful to investors as the types of events giving rise to them occur infrequently and are not representative of our core business operations or ongoing operating performance. Legal matter costs We have incurred losses from the settlement of legal matters and costs with respect to our 2015 internal U.S. Foreign Corrupt Practices Act, or FCPA, investigation in addition to the disgorgement payments we made to resolve the matter. We believe excluding these amounts from our non-GAAP financial measures is useful to investors as the types of events giving rise to them are not representative of our core business operations. Income tax effect of non-GAAP adjustments and certain discrete tax items The non-GAAP adjustments described above are reported on a pre-tax basis. The income tax effect of non-GAAP adjustments is the difference between GAAP and non-GAAP income tax expense. Non-GAAP income tax expense is computed on non-GAAP pre-tax income (GAAP pre-tax income adjusted for non-GAAP adjustments) and excludes certain discrete tax items (such as the release of income tax reserves due to statute expiration and one-time impacts of the TCJA), if any. We believe that applying the non-GAAP adjustments and their related income tax effect allows us to highlight income attributable to our core operations. 35 Table of Contents The following table reconciles GAAP income from operations to non-GAAP income from operations and non-GAAP operating margin for the years ended December 31, 2017, 2016 and 2015 (in thousands): 2017 2016 2015 Income from operations $ 316,219 $ 459,594 $ 466,150 Amortization of acquired intangible assets 30,904 26,642 27,067 Stock-based compensation 164,308 144,506 126,677 Amortization of capitalized stock-based compensation and capitalized interest expense 19,953 15,439 13,618 Restructuring charges 54,884 10,301 767 Acquisition-related costs 23,374 1,064 865 Legal matter costs 890 3,291 Non-GAAP income from operations $ 609,642 $ 658,436 $ 638,435 GAAP operating margin 13 % 20 % 21 % Non-GAAP operating margin 24 % 28 % 29 % The following table reconciles GAAP net income to non-GAAP net income for the years ended December 31, 2017, 2016 and 2015 (in thousands): 2017 2016 2015 Net income $ 218,321 $ 316,132 $ 321,406 Amortization of acquired intangible assets 30,904 26,642 27,067 Stock-based compensation 164,308 144,506 126,677 Amortization of capitalized stock-based compensation and capitalized interest expense 19,953 15,439 13,618 Restructuring charges 54,884 10,301 767 Acquisition-related costs 23,374 1,064 865 Legal matter costs 890 3,291 Amortization of debt discount and issuance costs 18,839 18,638 18,525 (Gain) loss on investments (450 ) (4,807 ) 25 Income tax effect of above non-GAAP adjustments and certain discrete tax items (77,385 ) (52,661 ) (58,309 ) Non-GAAP net income $ 452,748 $ 476,144 $ 453,932 36 Table of Contents The following table reconciles GAAP net income per diluted share to non-GAAP net income per diluted share for the years ended December 31, 2017, 2016 and 2015 (shares in thousands): 2017 2016 2015 GAAP net income per diluted share $ 1.26 $ 1.79 1.78 Amortization of acquired intangible assets 0.18 0.14 0.16 Stock-based compensation 0.95 0.82 0.70 Amortization of capitalized stock-based compensation and capitalized interest expense 0.12 0.09 0.08 Restructuring charges 0.32 0.06 Acquisition-related costs 0.14 0.01 Legal matter costs 0.01 0.02 Amortization of debt discount and issuance costs 0.11 0.11 0.10 (Gain) loss on investments (0.03 ) Income tax effect of above non-GAAP adjustments and certain discrete tax items (0.45 ) (0.30 ) (0.32 ) Non-GAAP net income per diluted share (1) $ 2.62 $ 2.70 $ 2.52 Shares used in per share calculations 172,711 176,215 180,415 (1) May not foot due to rounding Non-GAAP net income per diluted share is calculated as non-GAAP net income divided by diluted weighted average common shares outstanding. GAAP diluted weighted average shares outstanding are adjusted in non-GAAP per share calculations for the shares that would be delivered to us pursuant to the note hedge transactions entered into in connection with the issuance of our convertible senior notes. Under GAAP, shares delivered under hedge transactions are not considered offsetting shares in the fully-diluted share calculation until they are delivered. However, we would receive a benefit from the note hedge transactions and would not allow the dilution to occur, so management believes that adjusting for this benefit provides a meaningful view of net income per share. Unless and until our weighted average stock price is greater than $89.56, the initial conversion price, there will be no difference between our GAAP and non-GAAP diluted weighted average common shares outstanding. We consider Adjusted EBITDA to be another important indicator of the operational strength and performance of our business and a good measure of our historical operating trends. Adjusted EBITDA eliminates items that we do not consider to be part of our core operations. We define Adjusted EBITDA as GAAP net income excluding the following items: interest income; income taxes; depreciation and amortization of tangible and intangible assets; stock-based compensation; amortization of capitalized stock-based compensation; acquisition-related costs; restructuring charges; gains and other activity related to divestiture of a business; gains and losses on legal settlements; costs incurred with respect to our internal FCPA investigation; foreign exchange gains and losses; loss on early extinguishment of debt; amortization of debt discount and issuance costs; amortization of capitalized interest expense; certain gains and losses on investments; and other non-recurring or unusual items that may arise from time to time. Adjusted EBITDA margin represents Adjusted EBITDA stated as a percentage of revenue. 37 Table of Contents The following table reconciles GAAP net income to Adjusted EBITDA and Adjusted EBITDA margin for the years ended December 31, 2017, 2016 and 2015 (in thousands): 2017 2016 2015 Net income $ 218,321 $ 316,132 $ 321,406 Amortization of acquired intangible assets 30,904 26,642 27,067 Stock-based compensation 164,308 144,506 126,677 Amortization of capitalized stock-based compensation and capitalized interest expense 19,953 15,439 13,618 Restructuring charges 54,884 10,301 767 Acquisition-related costs 23,374 1,064 865 Legal matter costs 890 3,291 Interest income (17,855 ) (14,702 ) (11,200 ) Amortization of debt discount and issuance costs 18,839 18,638 18,525 Provision for income taxes 97,801 143,314 135,218 Depreciation and amortization 321,456 292,221 258,878 Other (income) expense, net (887 ) (3,788 ) 2,201 Adjusted EBITDA $ 931,098 $ 950,657 $ 897,313 Adjusted EBITDA margin 37 % 41 % 41 % Impact of Foreign Currency Exchange Rates Revenue and earnings from our international operations have historically been an important contributor to our financial results. Consequently, our financial results have been impacted, and management expects they will continue to be impacted, by fluctuations in foreign currency exchange rates. For example, when the local currencies of our foreign subsidiaries weaken, generally our consolidated results stated in U.S. dollars are negatively impacted. Because exchange rates are a meaningful factor in understanding period-to-period comparisons, management believes the presentation of the impact of foreign currency exchange rates on revenue and earnings enhances the understanding of our financial results and evaluation of performance in comparison to prior periods. The dollar impact of changes in foreign currency exchange rates presented is calculated by translating current period results using monthly average foreign currency exchange rates from the comparative period and comparing them to the reported amount. The percentage change at constant currency presented is calculated by comparing the prior period amounts as reported and the current period amounts translated using the same monthly average foreign currency exchange rates from the comparative period. Liquidity and Capital Resources To date, we have financed our operations primarily through public and private sales of debt and equity securities and cash generated by operations. As of December 31, 2017 , our cash, cash equivalents and marketable securities, which primarily consisted of corporate bonds and U.S. government agency securities, totaled $1.3 billion . Factoring in our convertible senior notes of $690.0 million, our net cash at December 31, 2017 was $589.5 million. We place our cash investments in instruments that meet high-quality credit standards, as specified in our investment policy. Our investment policy also limits the amount of our credit exposure to any one issue or issuer and seeks to manage these assets to achieve our goals of preserving principal and maintaining adequate liquidity at all times. Changes in cash, cash equivalents and marketable securities are dependent upon changes in, among other things, working capital items such as deferred revenues, accounts payable, accounts receivable and various accrued expenses, as well as changes in our capital and financial structure due to common stock repurchases, debt repurchases and issuances, stock option exercises, purchases and sales of marketable securities and similar events. We believe our strong balance sheet and cash position are important competitive differentiators that provide the financial flexibility necessary to make investments at opportune times. We expect to continue to evaluate strategic investments to strengthen our business. As of December 31, 2017 , we had cash and cash equivalents of $212.4 million held in accounts outside the U.S. As a result of the TCJA, we have recorded a provisional tax expense of $43.4 million related to the one-time transition tax on the mandatory deemed repatriation of cumulative foreign earnings as of December 31, 2017 . The TCJA also provides for a territorial tax system in the U.S., which may provide companies with the ability to repatriate earnings with minimal U.S. federal income tax impact beginning in 2018. We have sufficient cash in the U.S. to pay this tax obligation and do not need to rely on cash outside the U.S. for payment. As a result, our liquidity is not materially impacted by the amount of cash and cash equivalents held in accounts outside the U.S. For additional information, including information on the impact of the TCJA, see Note 17 to the consolidated financial statements included elsewhere in this annual report on Form 10-K. Cash Provided by Operating Activities For the Years Ended December 31, (in thousands) 2017 2016 2015 Net income $ 218,321 $ 316,132 $ 321,406 Non-cash reconciling items included in net income 596,624 515,328 454,667 Changes in operating assets and liabilities (13,962 ) 40,352 17,379 Net cash flows provided by operating activities $ 800,983 $ 871,812 $ 793,452 The decrease in cash provided by operating activities for 2017 as compared to 2016 was primarily due to lower profitability as a result of the restructuring charge in 2017 and increased level of expenses as a result of our 2017 acquisitions. Payroll and related costs, including annual bonus and commissions payouts, were higher in 2017 as compared to 2016 due to increased headcount and higher bonus and commission attainment levels. The increase in cash provided by operating activities for 2016 as compared to 2015 was primarily due to higher cash collection from customers due to increased revenue and lower commissions and annual bonus payments due to lower attainment levels. These increases to cash provided by operating activities were partially offset by higher cash payments for taxes during 2016 as compared to 2015 . 38 Table of Contents Cash Used in Investing Activities For the Years Ended December 31, (in thousands) 2017 2016 2015 Cash paid for acquired businesses, net of cash acquired $ (369,073 ) $ (95,439 ) $ (141,147 ) Purchases of property and equipment and capitalization of internal-use software development costs (414,778 ) (316,289 ) (444,983 ) Net marketable securities activity 326,272 (58,484 ) 153,060 Other investing activities (2,098 ) 782 (2,494 ) Net cash used in investing activities $ (459,677 ) $ (469,430 ) $ (435,564 ) The decrease in cash used in investing activities in 2017 as compared to 2016 was driven by a decrease in marketable securities activity. This was offset by the funding our 2017 acquisitions of Nominum and Soasta. We also increased our purchases of property and equipment in 2017 as compared to 2016 to support both network and facility expansion. The increase in cash used in investing activities in 2016 as compared to 2015 was driven by net marketable securities activity which was a net outflow for the year. Our excess cash as well as the proceeds from sales and maturities of our marketable securities were reinvested, as compared to 2015 , where we did not reinvest a portion of our proceeds in order to fund acquisitions. This outflow was partially offset by a decrease in purchases of property and equipment during 2016 , as compared 2015 , as we moderated investment in our network. Additionally, acquisitions during 2016 were of a smaller magnitude than those during 2015 . Cash Used in Financing Activities For the Years Ended December 31, (in thousands) 2017 2016 2015 Activity related to stock-based compensation $ (2,715 ) $ 14,015 $ 7,627 Repurchases of common stock (361,194 ) (373,794 ) (302,606 ) Other financing activities (1,096 ) (2,050 ) Net cash used in financing activities $ (365,005 ) $ (359,779 ) $ (297,029 ) The increase in cash used in financing activities during 2017 as compared to 2016 was primarily due to an increase in employee taxes paid related to net share settlement of stock-based awards. The increase in cash used in financing activities during 2016 as compared to 2015 was primarily the result of increased share repurchases. In October 2013, the Board of Directors authorized a $750.0 million share repurchase program, effective from October 16, 2013 through December 31, 2016. In February 2016, the Board of Directors authorized a $1.0 billion share repurchase program that superseded the October 2013 repurchase program and became effective in February 2016 through December 31, 2018. The Company's goals for the share repurchase program are to offset the dilution created by its employee equity compensation programs and to provide the flexibility to return capital to shareholders as business and market conditions warrant. During 2017, 2016 and 2015, we repurchased 6.9 million , 7.0 million and 4.5 million shares of our common stock, respectively, at an average price per share of $52.59 , $53.28 and $67.05 , respectively. These repurchases have contributed to a decrease in weighted average shares over at least the past three years. Convertible Senior Notes In February 2014, we issued $690.0 million in par value of convertible senior notes due 2019 and entered into related convertible note hedge and warrant transactions. The terms of the notes, hedge and warrant transactions are discussed more fully in Note 11 to the consolidated financial statements included elsewhere in this annual report on Form 10-K. We have used, and intend to use, the net proceeds of the offering for share repurchases, working capital and general corporate purposes, including potential acquisitions and other strategic transactions. The convertible senior notes are due in February 2019, and are classified as a long-term liability on our consolidated balance sheet as of December 31, 2017. We are currently assessing our options with respect to repayment of the notes. 39 Table of Contents Liquidity Outlook We believe, based on our present business plan, that our current cash, cash equivalents and marketable securities balances and our forecasted cash flows from operations will be sufficient to meet our foreseeable cash needs for at least the next 12 months. Our foreseeable cash needs, in addition to our recurring operating costs, include our expected capital expenditures, investments in information technology and facility expansion, opportunistic business acquisitions, anticipated share repurchases, lease and purchase commitments and settlements of other long-term liabilities. Contractual Obligations, Contingent Liabilities and Commercial Commitments The following table presents our contractual obligations and commercial commitments, as of December 31, 2017 , for the next five years and thereafter (in thousands): Payments Due by Period Total Less than 12 Months 12 to 36 Months 36 to 60 Months More than 60 Months Real estate operating leases $ 756,998 $ 50,187 $ 110,449 $ 114,891 $ 481,471 Bandwidth and co-location agreements 137,109 108,988 28,121 Open vendor purchase orders 105,340 93,385 9,380 2,575 Convertible senior notes 690,000 690,000 Total contractual obligations $ 1,689,447 $ 252,560 $ 837,950 $ 117,466 $ 481,471 In accordance with the authoritative guidance for accounting for uncertainty in income taxes, as of December 31, 2017 , we had unrecognized tax benefits of $ 90.7 million , including $ 10.7 million of accrued interest and penalties. We believe that it is reasonably possible that $3.3 million of our unrecognized tax benefits will be recognized by the end of 2018. The settlement period for the remaining amount of the unrecognized tax benefits is unknown. Letters of Credit As of December 31, 2017 , we had outstanding $6.4 million in irrevocable letters of credit issued by us in favor of third party beneficiaries, primarily related to facility leases. These irrevocable letters of credit, which are not included in the table of contractual obligations above, are unsecured and are expected to remain in effect, in some cases, until 2028 . Off-Balance Sheet Arrangements We have entered into indemnification agreements with third parties, including vendors, customers, landlords, our officers and directors, shareholders of acquired companies, joint venture partners and third parties to which we license technology. Generally, these indemnification agreements require us to reimburse losses suffered by a third party due to various events, such as lawsuits arising from patent or copyright infringement or our negligence. These indemnification obligations are considered off-balance sheet arrangements in accordance with the authoritative guidance for guarantor accounting and disclosure requirements for guarantees, including indirect guarantees of indebtedness of others. See Note 12 to our consolidated financial statements included elsewhere in this annual report on Form 10-K for further discussion of these indemnification agreements. The fair value of guarantees issued or modified during 2017 and 2016 was determined to be immaterial. Legal Matters We are party to litigation that we consider routine and incidental to our business. We do not currently expect the results of any of these litigation matters to have a material effect on our business, results of operations, financial condition or cash flows. In November 2015, Limelight filed a complaint in the U.S. District Court for the Eastern District of Virginia against Akamai and XO Communications LLC, or XO, alleging patent infringement by the two companies. The complaint seeks to recover from Akamai and XO significant monetary damages based upon lost revenue due to infringing technology used by the companies. We have agreed to indemnify XO for damages it incurs in this matter. We have made counterclaims in the action against Limelight alleging that Limelight has infringed Akamai content delivery patents, and we are seeking monetary damages based upon lost revenue due to the infringing technology used by Limelight. A trial date on Limelight's patents has been set for April 2018. We currently believe that the outcome of this litigation will not have a material impact on our business. 40 Table of Contents Significant Accounting Policies and Estimates See Note 2 to the consolidated financial statements included elsewhere in this annual report on Form 10-K for information regarding recent and newly adopted accounting pronouncements. Application of Critical Accounting Policies and Estimates Overview Our MD&A is based upon our consolidated financial statements, which have been prepared in accordance with GAAP. These principles require us to make estimates and judgments that affect the reported amounts of assets, liabilities, revenue and expenses, cash flow and related disclosure of contingent assets and liabilities. Our estimates include those related to revenue recognition, accounts receivable and related reserves, valuation and impairment of marketable securities, capitalized internal-use software development costs, goodwill and acquired intangible assets, income tax reserves, impairment and useful lives of long-lived assets and stock-based compensation. We base our estimates on historical experience and on various other assumptions that we believe to be reasonable under the circumstances at the time such estimates are made. Actual results may differ from these estimates. For a complete description of our significant accounting policies, see Note 2 to our consolidated financial statements included elsewhere in this annual report on Form 10-K. Definitions We define our critical accounting policies as those policies that require us to make subjective estimates and judgments about matters that are uncertain and are likely to have a material impact on our consolidated financial statements. Our estimates are based upon assumptions and judgments about matters that are highly uncertain at the time an accounting estimate is made and applied and require us to assess a range of potential outcomes. Review of Critical Accounting Policies and Estimates Revenue Recognition Revenue is recognized only when the price is fixed or determinable, persuasive evidence of an arrangement exists, the service is performed and collectability of the resulting receivable is reasonably assured. We primarily derive revenue from sales of services to customers executing contracts with terms of one year or longer. These contracts generally commit the customer to a minimum monthly, quarterly or annual level of usage and specify the rate at which the customer must pay for actual usage above the monthly, quarterly or annual minimum. For contracts with a monthly commitment, we recognize the monthly minimum as revenue each month, provided that an enforceable contract has been signed by both parties, the service has been delivered to the customer, the fee for the service is fixed or determinable and collection is reasonably assured. Should a customer usage of our service exceed the monthly minimum, we recognize revenue for such excess usage in the period of the additional usage. For annual or other non-monthly period revenue commitments, we recognize revenue monthly based upon the customer actual usage each month of the commitment period and only recognize any remaining committed amount for the applicable period in the last month thereof. We typically charge customers an integration fee when the purchased services are first activated. The integration fees are recorded as deferred revenue and recognized as revenue ratably over the estimated life of the customer arrangement. We also derive revenue from services sold as discrete, non-recurring events or based solely on usage. For these services, we recognize revenue once the event or usage has occurred. When more than one element is contained in a revenue arrangement, we determine the fair value for each element in the arrangement based on vendor-specific objective evidence, or VSOE, for each respective element, including any renewal rates for services contractually offered to the customer. Elements typically included in our multiple element arrangements consist of our core services the delivery of content, applications and software over the Internet as well as mobile and security solutions and enterprise professional services. These elements have value to our customers on a stand-alone basis in that they can be sold separately by another vendor. Generally, there is no right of return relative to these services. We typically use VSOE to determine the fair value of our separate elements. All stand-alone sales of professional services are reviewed to establish the average stand-alone selling price for those services. For our core services, the fair value is the price charged for a single deliverable on a per unit basis when it is sold separately. 41 Table of Contents For arrangements in which we are unable to establish VSOE, third party evidence, or TPE, of the fair value of each element is determined based upon the price charged when the element is sold separately by another vendor. For arrangements in which we are unable to establish VSOE or TPE for each element, we use the best estimate of selling price, or BESP, to determine the fair value of the separate deliverables. We estimate BESP based upon a management-approved price list and pre-established discount levels for each solution that take into consideration volume, geography and industry lines. We allocate arrangement consideration across the multiple elements using the relative selling price method. At the inception of a customer contract, we make an estimate as to that customer ability to pay for the services provided. We base our estimate on a combination of factors, including the successful completion of a credit check or financial review, our collection experience with the customer and other forms of payment assurance. Upon the completion of these steps, we recognize revenue monthly in accordance with our revenue recognition policy. If we subsequently determine that collection from the customer is not reasonably assured, we record an allowance for doubtful accounts and bad debt expense for all of that customer unpaid invoices and cease recognizing revenue for continued services provided until cash is received from the customer. Changes in our estimates and judgments about whether collection is reasonably assured would change the timing of revenue or amount of bad debt expense that we recognize. We also sell our services through a reseller channel. Assuming all other revenue recognition criteria are met, we recognize revenue from reseller arrangements based on the reseller contracted non-refundable minimum purchase commitments over the term of the contract, plus amounts sold by the reseller to its customers in excess of the minimum commitments. Amounts attributable to this excess usage are recognized as revenue in the period in which the service is provided. From time to time, we enter into contracts to sell our services or license our technology to unrelated enterprises at or about the same time we enter into contracts to purchase products or services from the same enterprises. If we conclude that these contracts were negotiated concurrently, we record as revenue only the net cash received from the vendor, unless the product or service received has a separate and identifiable benefit and the fair value to us of the vendor product or service can be objectively established. We may from time to time resell licenses or services of third parties. We record revenue for these transactions on a gross basis when we have risk of loss related to the amounts purchased from the third party and we add value to the license or service, such as by providing maintenance or support for such license or service. If these conditions are present, we recognize revenue when all other revenue recognition criteria are satisfied. Deferred revenue represents amounts billed to customers for which revenue has not been recognized. Deferred revenue primarily consists of the unearned portion of monthly billed service fees, prepayments made by customers for future periods, deferred integration and activation set-up fees and amounts billed under customer arrangements with extended payment terms. Accounts Receivable and Related Reserves Trade accounts receivable are recorded at the invoiced amounts and do not bear interest. In addition to trade accounts receivable, our accounts receivable balance includes unbilled accounts that represent revenue recorded for customers that is typically billed within one month. We record reserves against our accounts receivable balance. These reserves consist of allowances for doubtful accounts and revenue from certain customers on a cash-basis. Increases and decreases in the allowance for doubtful accounts are included as a component of general and administrative expense in the consolidated statements of income. Increases in the reserve for cash-basis customers are recorded as a reduction of revenue. The reserve for cash-basis customers increases as services are provided to customers for which collection is no longer reasonably assured. The reserve decreases and revenue is recognized when and if cash payments are received. Estimates are used in determining these reserves and are based upon our review of outstanding balances on a customer-specific, account-by-account basis. The allowance for doubtful accounts is based upon a review of customer receivables from prior sales with collection issues where we no longer believe that the customer has the ability to pay for prior services provided. We perform ongoing credit evaluations of our customers. If such an evaluation indicates that payment is no longer reasonably assured for services provided, any future services provided to that customer will result in creation of a cash basis reserve until we receive consistent payments. 42 Table of Contents Valuation and Impairment of Marketable Securities We measure the fair value of our financial assets and liabilities at the end of each reporting period. Fair value is defined as the exchange price that would be received for an asset or paid to transfer a liability (an exit price) in the principal or most advantageous market for the asset or liability in an orderly transaction between market participants on the measurement date. We have certain financial assets and liabilities recorded at fair value (principally cash equivalents and short- and long-term marketable securities) that have been classified as Level 1, 2 or 3 within the fair value hierarchy. Fair values determined by Level 1 inputs utilize quoted prices (unadjusted) in active markets for identical assets or liabilities that we can access at the reporting date. Fair values determined by Level 2 inputs utilize data points other than quoted prices included within Level 1 that are observable for the asset or liability, either directly or indirectly. Fair values determined by Level 3 inputs are based on unobservable data points for the asset or liability. Marketable securities are considered to be impaired when a decline in fair value below cost basis is determined to be other-than-temporary. We periodically evaluate whether a decline in fair value below cost basis is other-than-temporary by considering available evidence regarding these investments including, among other factors, the duration of the period that, and extent to which, the fair value is less than cost basis; the financial health of, and business outlook for, the issuer, including industry and sector performance and operational and financing cash flow factors; overall market conditions and trends; and our intent and ability to retain our investment in the security for a period of time sufficient to allow for an anticipated recovery in market value. Once a decline in fair value is determined to be other-than-temporary, a write-down is recorded and a new cost basis in the security is established. Assessing the above factors involves inherent uncertainty. Write-downs, if recorded, could be materially different from the actual market performance of marketable securities in our portfolio if, among other things, relevant information related to our investments and marketable securities was not publicly available or other factors not considered by us would have been relevant to the determination of impairment. Impairment and Useful Lives of Long-Lived Assets We review our long-lived assets, such as property and equipment and acquired intangible assets, for impairment whenever events or changes in circumstances indicate that the carrying amount of the assets may not be recoverable. Events that would trigger an impairment review include a change in the use of the asset or forecasted negative cash flows related to the asset. When such events occur, we compare the carrying amount of the asset to the undiscounted expected future cash flows related to the asset. If this comparison indicates that impairment is present, the amount of the impairment is calculated as the difference between the carrying amount and the fair value of the asset. If a readily determinable market price does not exist, fair value is estimated using discounted expected cash flows attributable to the asset. The estimates required to apply this accounting policy include forecasted usage of the long-lived assets, the useful lives of these assets and expected future cash flows. Changes in these estimates could materially impact results from operations. Goodwill and Acquired Intangible Assets We test goodwill for impairment on an annual basis, as of December 31, or more frequently if events or changes in circumstances indicate that the asset might be impaired. We have concluded that we have one reporting unit and that our chief operating decision maker is our chief executive officer and the executive management team. We have assigned the entire balance of goodwill to our one reporting unit. The fair value of the reporting unit was based on our market capitalization as of each of December 31, 2017 and 2016 , and it was substantially in excess of the carrying value of the reporting unit at each date. Acquired intangible assets consist of completed technologies, customer relationships, trademarks and trade names, non-compete agreements and acquired license rights. We engaged third party valuation specialists to assist us with the initial measurement of the fair value of acquired intangible assets. Acquired intangible assets, other than goodwill, are amortized over their estimated useful lives based upon the estimated economic value derived from the related intangible assets. Income Taxes Our provision for income taxes is comprised of a current and a deferred portion. The current income tax provision is calculated as the estimated taxes payable or refundable on tax returns for the current year. The deferred income tax provision is calculated for the estimated future tax effects attributable to temporary differences and carryforwards by using expected tax rates in effect in the years during which the differences are expected to reverse or the carryforwards are expected to be realized. We currently have net deferred tax assets, comprised of net operating loss, or NOL, carryforwards, tax credit carryforwards and deductible temporary differences. Our management periodically weighs the positive and negative evidence to determine if it is more likely than not that some or all of the deferred tax assets will be realized. In determining our net deferred tax assets 43 Table of Contents and valuation allowances, annualized effective tax rates and cash paid for income taxes, management is required to make judgments and estimates about domestic and foreign profitability, the timing and extent of the utilization of NOL carryforwards, applicable tax rates, transfer pricing methodologies and tax planning strategies. Judgments and estimates related to our projections and assumptions are inherently uncertain; therefore, actual results could differ materially from our projections. We have recorded certain tax reserves to address potential exposures involving our income tax positions. These potential tax liabilities result from the varying application of statutes, rules, regulations and interpretations by different taxing jurisdictions. Our estimate of the value of our tax reserves contains assumptions based on past experiences and judgments about the interpretation of statutes, rules and regulations by taxing jurisdictions. It is possible that the costs of the ultimate tax liability or benefit from these matters may be more or less than the amount that we estimated. Uncertainty in income taxes is recognized in our consolidated financial statements using a two-step process to determine the amount of tax benefit to be recognized. First, the tax position must be evaluated to determine the likelihood that it will be sustained upon external examination. If the tax position is deemed more-likely-than-not to be sustained based on technical merit, the tax position is then assessed to determine the amount of benefit to recognize in the financial statements. The amount of the benefit that may be recognized is the largest amount that we believe has a greater than 50% likelihood of being realized upon ultimate settlement. The TCJA made significant changes to the U.S. Internal Revenue Code, including a corporate income tax rate decrease from 35% to 21%, the implementation of a modified territorial tax system, a one-time transition tax on the mandatory deemed repatriation of cumulative foreign earnings as of December 31, 2017 and the repeal of the domestic production activities deduction, among other items. The Securities and Exchange Commission, or the Commission, issued guidance for the accounting for certain income tax effects of the TCJA that allows us to record provisional amounts during a measurement period not to extend beyond one year of the enactment date. We have recognized the provisional impacts related to the one-time transition tax and the re-measurement of our deferred tax balances in our consolidated financial statements for the year ended December 31, 2017. The ultimate impact could materially differ from the provisional amounts we have recorded due to additional analysis, changes in assumptions or interpretations we have made, additional guidance that may be issued and actions we may take as a result of the TCJA. For the one-time transition tax, further information is required to finalize the estimated amount of accumulated foreign earnings as well as to validate the amount of earnings represented by the aggregate foreign cash position as defined in the TCJA. For the re-measurement of the deferred tax assets and liabilities, further analysis will be required to refine our calculations and related account balances. We expect to complete the analysis within the measurement period, and any subsequent adjustment to the provisional amounts will be recognized as a current tax provision or benefit in the quarter of 2018 in which the analysis is completed. Accounting for Stock-Based Compensation We issue stock-based compensation awards including stock options, restricted stock units and deferred stock units. We measure the fair value of these awards at the grant date and recognize such fair value as expense over the vesting period. We have selected the Black-Scholes option pricing model to determine the fair value of stock option awards and the Monte Carlo simulation model to determine the fair value of market-based restricted stock awards. Determining the fair value of stock-based awards at the grant date requires judgment, including estimating the expected life of the stock awards and the volatility of the underlying common stock. Our assumptions may differ from those used in prior periods. Changes to the assumptions may have a significant impact on the fair value of stock-based awards, which could have a material impact on our financial statements. Judgment is also required in estimating the number of stock-based awards that are expected to be forfeited. Should our actual forfeiture rates differ significantly from our estimates, our stock-based compensation expense and results of operations could be materially impacted. In addition, for awards that vest and become exercisable only upon achievement of specified performance conditions, we make judgments and estimates each quarter about the probability that such performance conditions will be met or achieved. Changes to the estimates we make from time to time may have a significant impact on our stock-based compensation expense and could materially impact our result of operations. 44 Table of Contents Capitalized Internal-Use Software Costs We capitalize salaries and related costs, including stock-based compensation, of employees and consultants who devote time to the development of internal-use software development projects, as well as interest expense related to our senior convertible notes. Capitalization begins during the application development stage, once the preliminary project stage has been completed. If a project constitutes an enhancement to previously-developed software, we assess whether the enhancement creates additional functionality to the software, thus qualifying the work incurred for capitalization. Once the project is available for general release, capitalization ceases and we estimate the useful life of the asset and begin amortization. We periodically assess whether triggering events are present to review internal-use software for impairment. Changes in our estimates related to internal-use software would increase or decrease operating expenses or amortization recorded during the period.
