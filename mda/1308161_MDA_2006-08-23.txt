OVERVIEW OF THE COMPANY S BUSINESS The Company is a diversified entertainment company, which manages and reports its businesses in eight segments: Filmed Entertainment , which principally consists of the production and acquisition of live-action and animated motion pictures for distribution and licensing in all formats in all entertainment media worldwide, and the production of original television programming in the United States and Canada. Television , which principally consists of the operation of 35 full power broadcast television stations, including nine duopolies, in the United States (Of these stations, 25 are affiliated with the FOX network, nine are currently affiliated with the UPN network and one is an independent station. In September 2006, the nine UPN affiliated stations and the independent station will become affiliated with the MyNetworkTV network); the broadcasting of network programming in the United States, and the development, production and broadcasting of television programming in Asia. Cable Network Programming , which principally consists of the production and licensing of programming distributed through cable television systems and direct broadcast satellite ( DBS ) operators in the United States. Direct Broadcast Satellite Television , which principally consists of the distribution of premium programming services via satellite directly to subscribers in Italy. Magazines and Inserts , which principally consists of the publication of free standing inserts, which are promotional booklets containing consumer offers distributed through insertion in local Sunday newspapers in the United States, and providing in-store marketing products and services, primarily to consumer packaged goods manufacturers, in the United States and Canada. Newspapers , which principally consists of the publication of four national newspapers in the United Kingdom, the publication of more than 110 newspapers in Australia, and the publication of a mass circulation, metropolitan morning newspaper in the United States. Book Publishing , which principally consists of the publication of English language books throughout the world. Other , which includes NDS Group plc ( NDS ), a company engaged in the business of supplying open end-to-end digital technology and services to digital pay-television platform operators and content providers; News Outdoor, an advertising business which offers display advertising primarily in locations throughout Russia and Eastern Europe; Fox Interactive Media ( FIM ), which operates the Company Internet activities; and Global Cricket Corporation ( GCC ), which has the exclusive rights to broadcast the Cricket World Cup and other related events through 2007. Filmed Entertainment The Filmed Entertainment segment derives revenue from the production and distribution of feature motion pictures and television series. In general, motion pictures produced or acquired for distribution by the Company are exhibited in U.S. and foreign theaters followed by DVDs, pay-per-view television, premium subscription television, network television and basic cable and syndicated television exploitation. Television series initially produced for the networks and first-run syndication are generally licensed to domestic and international markets concurrently. The more successful series are typically released in seasonal DVD box sets and later syndicated in 42 Table of Contents domestic markets and international markets. The length of the revenue cycle for television series will vary depending on the number of seasons a series remains in active production and therefore may cause fluctuations in operating results. License fees received for television exhibition (including international and U.S. premium television and basic cable television) are recorded as revenue in the period that licensed films or programs are available for such exhibition, which may cause substantial fluctuations in operating results. The revenues and operating results of the Filmed Entertainment segment are significantly affected by the timing of the Company theatrical and home entertainment releases, the number of its original and returning television series that are aired by television networks, and the number of its television series in off-network syndication. Theatrical and home entertainment release dates are determined by several factors, including timing of vacation and holiday periods and competition in the marketplace. The distribution windows for the release of motion pictures theatrically and in various home entertainment formats have been compressing and may continue to change in the future. A reduction in timing between theatrical and home entertainment releases could adversely affect the revenues and operating results of this segment. In seeking to manage its risk, the Company has pursued a strategy of entering into agreements to share the financing of certain films with other parties. The parties to these arrangements include studio and non-studio entities, both domestic and foreign. In several of these agreements, other parties control certain distribution rights. Operating costs incurred by the Filmed Entertainment segment include exploitation costs, primarily theatrical prints and advertising and home entertainment marketing and manufacturing costs; the amortization of capitalized production, overhead and interest costs; and participations and talent residuals. Selling, general and administrative expenses include salaries, employee benefits, rent and other routine overhead. The Company competes with other major studios, such as Disney, DreamWorks, Paramount, Sony, Universal, Warner Bros. and independent film producers in the production and distribution of motion pictures and DVDs. As a producer and distributor of television programming, the Company competes with studios, television production groups and independent producers and syndicators, such as Disney, Sony, NBC Universal, Warner Bros. and Paramount Television to sell programming both domestically and internationally. The Company also competes to obtain creative talent and story properties which are essential to the success of the Company filmed entertainment businesses. In the operation of its businesses, the Company engages the services of writers, directors, actors and others, which are subject to collective bargaining agreements. Work stoppages and/or higher costs in connection with these agreements could adversely impact the Company operations. Television and Cable Network Programming The Company U.S. television operations consist of the FOX Broadcasting Company ( FOX ) and the 35 television stations owned by the Company. The Company international television operations consist primarily of STAR Group Limited ( STAR ). The television broadcast environment is highly competitive. The primary methods of competition in broadcast television are the development and acquisition of popular programming and the development of audience interest through programming promotion, in order to sell advertising at profitable rates. FOX competes for audience, advertising revenues and programming with other broadcast networks, such as CBS, ABC, NBC, UPN and The WB, independent television stations, cable program services, as well as other media, including DBS television services, DVDs, video games, print and the Internet. In addition, FOX competes with the other broadcast networks to secure affiliations with independently owned television stations in markets across the country. (See Other Recent Business Developments below for discussion of the announced UPN and The WB network combination and the launch of MyNetworkTV.) The television stations owned by the Company compete for programming, audiences and advertising revenues with other television stations and cable networks in their respective coverage areas and, in some cases, 43 Table of Contents with respect to programming, with other station groups, and in the case of advertising revenues, with other local and national media. The competitive position of the television stations owned by the Company is largely influenced by the strength of FOX, and, in particular, the primetime viewership of FOX, as well as the quality of the syndicated programs and local news programs in time periods not programmed by FOX. Generally, the Company cable networks which target various demographics, derive a majority of their revenues from monthly affiliate fees received from cable television systems and DBS operators based on the number of its subscribers, net of the amortization of cable distribution investments (capitalized fees paid to a cable operator or DBS operator to facilitate the launch of a cable network). The Company defers the cable distribution investments and amortizes the amounts on a straight-line basis over the contract period. Cable television and DBS are currently the predominant means of distribution of the Company program services in the United States. Internationally, distribution technology varies region by region. The Company cable networks, including the Fox News Channel ( Fox News ), the FX Network ( FX ), and the Regional Sports Networks ( RSNs ), compete for carriage on cable television systems, DBS systems and other distribution systems with other program services, as well as other uses of bandwidth, such as retransmission of free over-the-air broadcast networks, telephony and data transmission. A primary focus of competition is for distribution of the Company cable network channels that are not already distributed within a particular cable television or DBS system. For such program services, distributors make decisions on the use of bandwidth based on various considerations, including amounts paid by programmers for launches, subscription fees payable by distributors and appeal to the distributors subscribers. In Asia, STAR programming is primarily distributed via satellite to local cable operators or other pay television platform operators for distribution to their subscribers. STAR derives its revenue from the sale of advertising time and affiliate fees from these pay television platform operators. The most significant operating expenses of the Television segment and the Cable Network Programming segment are the acquisition and production expenses related to programming and the production and technical expenses related to operating the technical facilities of the broadcaster or cable network. Other expenses include promotional expenses related to improving the market visibility and awareness of the broadcaster or cable network and sales commissions paid to the in-house advertising sales force, as well as salaries, employee benefits, rent and other routine overhead expenses. The Company has several multi-year sports rights agreements, including contracts with the National Football League ( NFL ) through fiscal 2012, contracts with the National Association of Stock Car Auto Racing ( NASCAR ) for certain races and exclusive rights for certain ancillary content through calendar year 2014 and a contract with Major League Baseball ( MLB ) through calendar year 2013. These contracts provide the Company with the broadcast rights to certain national sporting events during their respective terms. The costs of these sports contracts are charged to expense based on the ratio of each period operating profits to estimated total remaining operating profit of the contract. The profitability of these long-term national sports contracts is based on the Company best estimates at June 30, 2006 of directly attributable revenues and costs; such estimates may change in the future, and such changes may be significant. Should revenues decline from estimates applied at June 30, 2006, a loss may be recorded. Should revenues improve as compared to estimated revenues, the Company will have an improved operating profit related to the contract, which will be recognized over the estimated remaining contract term. While the Company seeks to ensure compliance with federal indecency laws and related Federal Communications Commission ( FCC ) regulations, the definition of indecency is subject to interpretation and there can be no assurance that the Company will not broadcast programming that is ultimately determined by the FCC to violate the prohibition against indecency. Such programming could subject the Company to regulatory review or investigation, fines, adverse publicity or other sanctions, including the loss of station licenses. 44 Table of Contents Direct Broadcast Satellite Television SKY Italia derives revenues principally from subscriber fees. The Company believes that the quality and variety of video, audio and interactive programming, quality of picture, access to service, customer service and price are the key elements for gaining and maintaining market share. SKY Italia competition includes companies that offer video, audio, interactive programming, telephony, data and other information and entertainment services, including broadband Internet providers, digital terrestrial transmission ( DTT ) services, wireless companies and companies that are developing new technologies. During fiscal 2005, competitive DTT services in Italy expanded to include pay-per-view offering of soccer games previously available exclusively on the SKY Italia platform. The Company is currently prohibited from providing a DTT service under regulations of the European Commission. In addition, the Italian government previously offered a subsidy on the purchase of DTT decoders. SKY Italia most significant operating expenses are those related to acquiring entertainment, movie and sports programming and subscribers and the production and technical expenses related to operating the technical facilities. Operating expenses related to sports programming are generally recognized over the course of the related sport season, which may cause fluctuations in the operating results of this segment. Magazines and Inserts The Magazine and Inserts segment derives revenues from the sale of advertising space in free standing inserts, in-store promotional advertising, subscriptions and production fees. Adverse changes in general market conditions for advertising may affect revenues. Operating expenses for the Magazine and Inserts segment include paper costs, promotional, printing, retail commissions, distribution expenses and production costs. Selling, general and administrative expenses include salaries, employee benefits, rent and other routine overhead. Newspapers The Newspapers segment derives revenues from the sale of advertising space and the sale of published newspapers. Competition for circulation is based upon the content of the newspaper, service and price. Adverse changes in general market conditions for advertising may affect revenues. Circulation revenues can be greatly affected by changes in competitors cover prices and by promotion activities. Operating expenses for the Newspapers segment include costs related to newsprint, ink, printing costs and editorial content. Selling, general and administrative expenses include salaries, employee benefits, rent and other routine overhead. The Newspapers segment advertising volume, circulation and the price of newsprint are the key uncertainties whose fluctuations can have a material effect on the Company operating results and cash flow. The Company has to anticipate the level of advertising volume, circulation and newsprint prices in managing its businesses to maximize operating profit during expanding and contracting economic cycles. Newsprint is a basic commodity and its price is sensitive to the balance of supply and demand. The Company costs and expenses are affected by the cyclical increases and decreases in the price of newsprint. The newspapers published by the Company compete for readership and advertising with local and national newspapers and also compete with television, radio and other media alternatives in their respective locales. Competition for newspaper circulation is based on the news and editorial content of the newspaper, cover price and, from time to time, various promotions. The success of the newspapers published by the Company in competing with other newspapers and media for advertising depends upon advertisers judgments as to the most effective use of their advertising budgets. Competition for advertising among newspapers is based upon circulation levels, readership levels, reader demographics, advertising rates and advertiser results. Such judgments are based on factors, such as cost, availability of alternative media, circulation and quality of readership demographics. Book Publishing The Book Publishing segment derives revenues from the sale of general and children books in the United States and internationally. The revenues and operating results of the Book Publishing segment are significantly 45 Table of Contents affected by the timing of the Company releases and the number of its books in the marketplace. The book publishing marketplace is subject to increased periods of demand in the summer months and during the end-of-year holiday season. Each book is a separate and distinct product, and its financial success depends upon many factors, including public acceptance. Major new title releases represent a significant portion of the Company sales throughout the year. Consumer books are generally sold on a fully returnable basis, resulting in the return of unsold books. In the domestic and international markets, the Company is subject to global trends and local economic conditions. Operating expenses for the Book Publishing segment include costs related to paper, printing, authors royalties, editorial, art and design expenses. Selling, general and administrative expenses include promotional expenses, salaries, employee benefits, rent and other routine overhead. The book publishing business operates in a highly competitive market and has been affected by consolidation trends. This market continues to change in response to technological innovations and other factors. Recent years have brought a number of significant mergers among the leading book publishers. The book superstore remains a significant factor in the industry contributing to the general trend toward consolidation in the retail channel. There have also been a number of mergers completed in the distribution channel. The Company must compete with other publishers such as Random House, Penguin Group, Simon & Schuster and Hachette Livre, for the rights to works by well-known authors and public personalities. Although the Company currently has strong positions in each of its markets, further consolidation in the book publishing industry could place the Company at a competitive disadvantage with respect to scale and resources. Other NDS NDS supplies open end-to-end digital technology and services to digital pay-television platform operators and content providers. NDS technologies include conditional access and microprocessor security, broadcast stream management, set-top box middleware, electronic program guides, digital video recording technologies and interactive infrastructure and applications. NDS software systems, consultancy and systems integration services are focused on providing platform operators and content providers with technology to help them profit from the secure distribution of digital information and entertainment to consumer devices which incorporate various technologies supplied by NDS. News Outdoor The Company sells, through its News Outdoor businesses, advertising space on various media, including billboards, street furniture and transit shelters, unique boards, airport transit advertising and in-store point of sale displays in shopping malls and supermarkets. It has outdoor advertising operations primarily in Russia and Eastern Europe.

Web properties include the social networking site MySpace.com, IGN.com, AmericanIdol.com, Scout.com and Foxsports.com. The Company also has a distribution agreement with Microsoft MSN for Foxsports.com. Other Recent Business Developments During fiscal 2006, the Company broadened its international video distribution agreement with Metro-Goldwyn-Mayer ( MGM ) into a worldwide home video distribution arrangement, commencing September 1, 2006 for most territories. The Company released approximately 350 MGM home entertainment theatrical, catalog and television programs internationally in fiscal 2006. 46 Table of Contents In January 2006, CBS Corporation, owner of the UPN network ( UPN ), and Time Warner Inc., owner of the WB network (the WB ), announced that UPN and the WB would combine to form a new network, which is expected to launch in September 2006. The Company owns nine major-market television stations that are currently affiliated with UPN. In February 2006, the Company announced it would launch MyNetworkTV, a new primetime program network in September 2006. MyNetworkTV will provide primetime programming to the Company nine stations that had been affiliated with UPN, the Company independent station, as well as to numerous affiliate stations. To the extent MyNetworkTV is not successful, the Company operating results in the Television segment may be adversely impacted. In May 2006, the Company acquired a regional cable sports channel for approximately $375 million. This channel has rights to the National Hockey League (the NHL ) Atlanta Thrashers and shares rights to MLB Atlanta Braves and the National Basketball Association (the NBA ) Atlanta Hawks with one of the Company existing regional sports networks. In July 2006, the Company and an independent third party agreed to acquire TGRT, a national, general interest broadcast television station in Turkey, for approximately $100 million from Ilhas Yahin Holding and other individual shareholders. The closing of this transaction is subject to customary closing conditions, including Turkish regulatory approval. In August 2006, the Company announced that its FIM division entered into a multi-year search technology and services agreement with Google, Inc. ( Google ), pursuant to which Google will be the exclusive search and keyword targeted advertising sales provider for a majority of FIM web properties. Under the terms of the agreement, Google will be obligated to make guaranteed minimum revenue share payments to FIM of $900 million based on FIM achievement of certain traffic and other commitments. These guaranteed minimum revenue share payments are expected to be made over the period beginning the first quarter of calendar 2007 and ending in the second quarter of calendar 2010. 47 Table of Contents RESULTS OF OPERATIONS Results of Operations Fiscal 2006 versus Fiscal 2005 The following table sets forth the Company operating results for fiscal 2006 as compared to fiscal 2005.

As such, net income available to the Company stockholders is allocated between the Class A Common Stock and Class B Common Stock. Overview The Company revenues in fiscal 2006 increased 6% as compared to fiscal 2005. The increase was primarily due to revenue increases at the Cable Network Programming, Filmed Entertainment, DBS and Other segments. Operating expenses for the fiscal year ended June 30, 2006 increased approximately 4% from fiscal 2005, primarily due to increased expenses at the Cable Network Programming segment and acquisitions made by the Newspaper segment and FIM during fiscal 2005 and 2006. The increased operating expenses at the Cable Network Programming segment were due to the acquisition in April 2005 of the Florida and Ohio Regional Sports Networks ( RSNs ) and Fox Sports Net, a national sports program service, and higher programming costs at the remaining RSNs and the FX Network ( FX ). In addition, operating results include the consolidation of Queensland Press Pty Ltd ( QPL ), which was acquired in November 2004, within the Newspapers segment and the impact of the internet businesses acquired by the Company in fiscal 2006, collectively referred to as the FIM acquisitions. These increases were partially offset by reduced operating expenses at the Filmed Entertainment and Television segments. The operating expense reduction at the Filmed Entertainment segment was due to 48 Table of Contents reduced amortization of production and participation costs. The decrease in operating expenses at the Television segment was mainly due to the absence of programming costs for the NFL Super Bowl and NASCAR Daytona 500 that were broadcast in fiscal 2005. Selling, general and administrative expenses increased approximately 8% for the fiscal year ended June 30, 2006 from fiscal 2005, primarily due to the consolidation of the Florida and Ohio RSNs, Fox Sports Net and QPL. In addition, the impact of acquisitions at FIM also contributed to the increase in selling, general and administrative expenses during the fiscal year ended June 30, 2006. Depreciation and amortization expense increased approximately 20% during the fiscal year ended June 30, 2006, when compared to fiscal 2005, primarily due to the amortization of intangible assets acquired on the purchase of the minority interest in the FEG in March 2005, as well as incremental expenses resulting from the FIM acquisitions. Accelerated depreciation recognized on printing plant assets in the United Kingdom also contributed to the increase. During the fiscal year ended June 30, 2006, Operating income increased 9% from fiscal 2005, primarily due to the revenue increases noted above. The Operating income increase was offset by a $109 million redundancy provision recorded as an other operating charge during fiscal 2006. The redundancy provision, recorded at the Newspapers segment, was related to certain U.K. employees as a result of the Company committing to a reduction in workforce, associated with the development of new printing plants in the United Kingdom. Interest expense, net Interest expense, net increased $9 million for the fiscal year ended June 30, 2006 as compared to fiscal 2005. This increase is primarily due to interest on the Company issuance of $1.0 billion in 6.2% Senior Notes due 2034 and $750 million in 5.3% Senior Notes due 2014 in December 2004 and $1.15 billion in 6.4% Senior Notes due 2035 in December 2005. The increase in interest expense was partially offset by higher interest income. Equity earnings of affiliates Net earnings from affiliates for the fiscal year ended June 30, 2006 increased $533 million as compared to fiscal 2005. The improvement for fiscal 2006 was due to an increased contribution from The DIRECTV Group, Inc. ( DIRECTV ) on subscriber growth and increased pricing. DIRECTV results also reflect lower expenses associated with a new set-top receiver lease program, as well as the absence of charges recognized in fiscal 2005 related to the SPACEWAY program and PanAmSat. For the years ended June 30, 2006 2005 Change % Change ($ millions) The Company share of equity earnings (losses) of affiliates principally consists of: British Sky Broadcasting Group plc $ 369 $ 374 $ (5 ) (1 )% The DIRECTV Group, Inc. 246 (186 ) 432 ** Sky Brasil 23 49 (26 ) (53 )% Innova 61 27 34 ** Other DBS equity affiliates 24 5 19 ** Cable channel equity affiliates 68 46 22 48 % Other equity affiliates 97 40 57 ** Total Equity earnings (losses) of affiliates $ 888 $ 355 $ 533 ** ** not meaningful 49 Table of Contents Other, net Footnote reference For the years ended June 30, 2006 2005 (in millions) Loss on sale of Regional Programming Partners 3 $ $ (85 ) Gain on sale of Innova 6 206 Gain on sale of China Netcom 6 52 Loss on sale of Sky Multi-Country Partners 6 (55 ) Gain on sale of Rogers Sportsnet 6 39 Change in fair value of exchangeable securities (a) 10 (76 ) 246 Other 12 33 Total Other, net $ 194 $ 178 (a) The Company has certain outstanding exchangeable debt securities which contain embedded derivatives.

A significant variance in the price of the underlying stock could have a material impact on the operating results of the Company. Income tax expense The effective tax rate for the fiscal year ended June 30, 2006 was 35%. The effective tax rate for fiscal 2006 reflects the positive impact of the Company application of the American Jobs Creation Act of 2004 ( AJCA ). The Company reflected a tax benefit of approximately $126 million in the fiscal year ended June 30, 2006, primarily resulting from the reduction of prior deferred tax accruals relating to the repatriation of foreign earnings at the lower rate of 5.25% under the AJCA. The effective tax rate for fiscal 2006 was slightly higher than the effective tax rate for fiscal 2005 of 34%, primarily due to the impact of the resolution of foreign income tax audits in fiscal 2005, offset by the impact of the AJCA noted above. Minority interest in subsidiaries, net of tax Minority interest expense improved by $146 million for the fiscal year ended June 30, 2006, as compared to the fiscal year ended June 30, 2005. The improvement was primarily due to the acquisition of minority shares of FEG in fiscal 2005. Gain on disposition of discontinued operations, net of tax In October 2005, the Company sold its TSL Education Ltd. division ( TSL ), which primarily included The Times Educational Supplement publication in the United Kingdom, for cash consideration of approximately $395 million. In connection with this transaction, the Company recorded a gain of $381 million, net of tax of $0. In April 2006, the Company sold Sky Radio Limited ( Sky Radio ), a commercial radio station group in the Netherlands and Germany, for cash consideration of approximately $215 million. In connection with this transaction, the Company recorded a gain of approximately $134 million, net of tax of $0. Both of these transactions are included in gain on disposition of discontinued operations in the consolidated statement of operations for the fiscal year ended June 30, 2006. There is no provision for income taxes related to these transactions as any tax due is offset by a release of a valuation allowance that was applied to an existing deferred tax asset established for capital losses, which, because of the sale of TSL and Sky Radio, can now be utilized. Therefore, there is no resulting tax provision. Cumulative effect of accounting change, net of tax Effective July 1, 2005, the Company adopted Emerging Issues Task Force Topic No. D-108, Use of the Residual Method to Value Acquired Assets Other Than Goodwill ( D-108 ). D-108 requires companies who have applied the residual value method in the valuation of acquired identifiable intangibles for purchase accounting and impairment testing to use a direct value method. As a result of the adoption, the Company recorded a charge of $1.6 billion ($1 billion net of tax, or 50 Table of Contents ($0.33) per diluted share of Class A Common Stock and ($0.28) per diluted share of Class B Common Stock), to reduce the intangible balances attributable to its television stations FCC licenses. This charge has been reflected as a cumulative effect of accounting change, net of tax in the consolidated statement of operations for the fiscal year ended June 30, 2006. Net income Net income increased $186 million for the fiscal year ended June 30, 2006 as compared to fiscal 2005. The increase was primarily due to increases in Operating income, Equity earnings from affiliates, Other income, the Gain on the disposition of discontinued operations, as well as lower minority interest expense, partially offset by the Cumulative effect of accounting change.

This increase is primarily due to an increase in worldwide theatrical, pay television and free television revenues, partially offset by a decrease in worldwide home entertainment revenues. Theatrical revenues increased primarily due to improved performance and an increase in the number of releases, driven by successful titles including Ice Age: The Meltdown, X-Men: The Last Stand, Fantastic Four, Walk the Line, Big Momma House 2 and Cheaper by the Dozen 2. Fiscal 2005 theatrical releases included I, Robot, Alien vs. Predator, Robots, Hide & Seek and Sideways. The increases in worldwide pay television and free television revenues are primarily due to a stronger film lineup, more feature films available during fiscal 51 Table of Contents 2006 and stronger revenues from the returning primetime series 24 and new primetime series Prison Break and My Name Is Earl . Fiscal 2006 worldwide home entertainment revenues were driven by the worldwide release of Fantastic Four, Walk the Line, Robots, Kingdom of Heaven and Hide & Seek. Fiscal 2005 included the worldwide home entertainment release of The Day After Tomorrow, I, Robot, Alien vs. Predator, Garfield, Dodgeball, Man on Fire, Napoleon Dynamite, the Star Wars Trilogy and the distribution fees earned for The Passion of the Christ . The film home entertainment decreases were slightly offset by home entertainment revenue from television titles, including Family Guy and 24. Home entertainment revenues generated from the sale and distribution of film and television titles in fiscal 2006 were 76% and 24%, respectively, of total home entertainment revenues. Operating income at the Filmed Entertainment segment for fiscal 2006 increased $34 million, or 3%, as compared to fiscal 2005. This improvement was due to the revenue changes noted above and lower home entertainment marketing and manufacturing costs, partially offset by higher theatrical marketing costs directly associated with the increased number of releases. Television (21% and 22% of the Company consolidated revenues in fiscal 2006 and 2005, respectively) For the fiscal year ended June 30, 2006, Television segment revenue was consistent with fiscal 2005. The Television segment reported an increase in Operating income for the fiscal year ended June 30, 2006 of $80 million, or 8%, from fiscal 2005. Revenues at the Company U.S. television operations decreased 1% for the fiscal year ended June 30, 2006 as compared to fiscal 2005. The decrease was primarily due to the broadcast of the Super Bowl and Daytona 500 in fiscal 2005, with no comparable events in fiscal 2006. Partially offsetting these decreases is an increase in primetime net advertising revenue as a result of higher primetime ratings, pricing and continued growth in local news programming versus fiscal 2005. Operating income at the Company U.S. television operations for the fiscal year ended June 30, 2006 increased approximately 11% from fiscal 2005. The increase was mainly due to the absence of programming costs for the Super Bowl and Daytona 500 that were broadcast in fiscal 2005, partially offset by the decreased revenues noted above and by higher programming costs for returning shows, local news expansions, music license fees and new sports programming on the UPN affiliated stations. Revenues for the fiscal year ended June 30, 2006 at the Company international television operations increased over fiscal 2005. The increase was primarily driven by higher advertising and subscription revenues. Operating income for the Company international television operations increased for the fiscal year ended June 30, 2006 over fiscal 2005, primarily driven by increased revenues, as noted above, which were partially offset by increased programming costs associated with the launch of new programming. Cable Network Programming (13% and 11% of the Company consolidated revenues in fiscal 2006 and 2005, respectively) For the fiscal year ended June 30, 2006, revenues for the Cable Network Programming segment increased $670 million, or 25%, as compared to fiscal 2005. For fiscal 2006, Fox News, FX and the RSNs revenues increased 13%, 14% and 30%, respectively, from fiscal 2005. Fox News advertising revenues increased 5% for the fiscal year ended June 30, 2006 from fiscal 2005, primarily driven by higher pricing and higher volume. Net affiliate revenue increased 7% for the fiscal year ended June 30, 2006, as a result of increases in subscribers and average rates per subscriber from fiscal 2005. As of June 30, 2006, Fox News reached approximately 89 million Nielsen households. FX advertising revenues increased 14% for the fiscal year ended June 30, 2006 as compared to fiscal 2005. The increase was driven by higher pricing and higher ratings as compared to fiscal 2005. For the fiscal year ended June 30, 2006, net affiliate revenue increased 15% as compared to fiscal 2005, reflecting an increase in average rates per subscriber and DBS subscribers. As of June 30, 2006, FX reached approximately 89 million Nielsen households. 52 Table of Contents The RSNs advertising revenues increased 21% for the fiscal year ended June 30, 2006 as compared to fiscal 2005. The increase was primarily due to the acquisition of the Florida and Ohio RSNs in April 2005. Also contributing to the increase in revenue was the resumption of NHL games in the second quarter of fiscal 2006 after the cancellation of the 2004-05 NHL season. In addition, there was an increase in overall advertising pricing in fiscal 2006 as compared to fiscal 2005. Affiliate revenues increased 33% for the fiscal year ended June 30, 2006 as compared to fiscal 2005. This increase was primarily due to the consolidation of the Florida and Ohio RSNs, the absence of fiscal 2005 allowances related to the cancellation of the 2004-05 NHL season, an increase in DBS subscribers and higher average rates per subscriber. The Cable Network Programming segment Operating income increased $162 million, or 23%, for the fiscal year ended June 30, 2006, as compared to fiscal 2005. This improvement was primarily driven by the revenue increases noted above, partially offset by higher programming expenses. Programming expenses increased primarily due to the consolidation of the Florida and Ohio RSNs and Fox Sports Net in April 2005 and the programming costs associated with the resumption of NHL games after the cancellation of the 2004-05 season. Also contributing to this increase were newly acquired series and more original programming at FX. In addition, marketing expenses increased at FX due to increased promotion costs for its new original series, as well as returning shows in fiscal 2006. Direct Broadcast Satellite Television (10% of the Company consolidated revenues in fiscal 2006 and 2005, respectively) For the fiscal year ended June 30, 2006, SKY Italia revenues increased $229 million, or 10%, as compared to fiscal 2005. This revenue growth was primarily driven by an increase in subscribers over fiscal 2005. During fiscal 2006, SKY Italia added approximately 513,000 net subscribers, which resulted in SKY Italia subscriber base totaling more than 3.8 million at June 30, 2006. The total churn for the fiscal year ended June 30, 2006 was approximately 314,000 on an average subscriber base of 3.6 million, as compared to churn of approximately 270,000 subscribers on an average subscriber base of 3.0 million in fiscal 2005. Subscriber churn for the period represents the number of SKY Italia subscribers whose service was disconnected during the period. Average revenue per subscriber ( ARPU ) for the fiscal year ended June 30, 2006 was over 44. The ARPU for the fiscal year ended June 30, 2006 improved slightly over fiscal 2005 primarily due to a nearly 2 price increase during the second quarter of fiscal 2006, which was partially offset by price promotions. SKY Italia calculates ARPU by dividing total subscriber-related revenues for the period by the average subscribers for the period and dividing that amount by the number of months in the period. Subscriber-related revenues are comprised of total subscription revenue, pay-per-view revenue and equipment rental revenue for the period. Average subscribers are calculated for the respective periods by adding the beginning and ending subscribers for the period and dividing by two. Subscriber acquisition costs per subscriber ( SAC ) of approximately 260 in fiscal 2006 increased over fiscal 2005 due to changes in the consumer offer that reflected lower upfront activation fees and increased advertising and marketing costs on a per gross addition basis, although fiscal 2006 marketing and advertising costs on an aggregate basis remained relatively flat as compared to fiscal 2005. SAC is calculated by dividing total subscriber acquisition costs for a period by the number of gross SKY Italia subscribers during the period. Subscriber acquisition costs include the cost of the commissions paid to retailers and other distributors, the cost of equipment sold directly by SKY Italia to subscribers and the costs related to installation and acquisition advertising, net of any upfront activation fee. SKY Italia excludes the value of equipment capitalized under SKY Italia equipment lease program, as well as payments and the value of returned equipment related to disconnected lease program subscribers from subscriber acquisition costs. During the fiscal year ended June 30, 2006, the strengthening of the U.S. dollar resulted in decreases of approximately 4% in both revenues and operating income as compared to fiscal 2005. 53 Table of Contents For the fiscal year ended June 30, 2006, Operating results at SKY Italia improved by $212 million as compared to fiscal 2005. The improvement was primarily due to the revenue increases noted above, partially offset by increased programming costs associated with the larger subscriber base, as well as higher spending primarily due to the broadcast of additional movie titles and new entertainment channels on the basic programming tier. Magazines and Inserts (4% of the Company consolidated revenues in fiscal 2006 and 2005, respectively) For the fiscal year ended June 30, 2006, revenues at the Magazines and Inserts segment increased $22 million, or 2%, as compared to fiscal 2005. The increase in fiscal 2006 primarily resulted from an increase in sales of the Company in-store marketing products due to higher demand in supermarkets, partially offset by lower rates for the publication of free standing inserts. Operating income for the fiscal year ended June 30, 2006 increased $9 million, or 3%, as compared to fiscal 2005. The increase was primarily due to volume increases for in-store marketing products, partially offset by the lower rates for the publication of free standing inserts, as noted above. Newspapers (16% and 17% of the Company consolidated revenues in fiscal years 2006 and 2005, respectively) The Newspapers segment revenues were relatively flat as compared to fiscal 2005. Operating income decreased $223 million, or 30%, for the fiscal year ended June 30, 2006 as compared to fiscal 2005. During the fiscal year ended June 30, 2006, the strengthening of the U.S. dollar resulted in decreases of approximately 2% in both revenues and operating income as compared to fiscal 2005. For the fiscal year ended June 30, 2006, the U.K. newspapers revenues decreased 7% as compared to fiscal 2005. The U.K. newspapers advertising revenues decreased from fiscal 2005 as a result of a general weakness in the U.K. advertising market. Advertising revenues were affected by lower mono display and lower classified revenues across all titles. Revenues also decreased due to the absence of revenue from TSL Education Ltd., which the Company sold in October 2005. The decrease was partially offset by higher color display revenue on The Sun , The Times and The Sunday Times and increased circulation revenues due to cover price increases across all titles and higher net circulation on The Times as a result of promotional activities and strong editorial content. U.K. newspapers Operating income decreased 70% for the fiscal year ended June 30, 2006 as compared to fiscal 2005. This decrease was primarily due to a redundancy provision of $109 million recorded in fiscal 2006 for certain U.K. production employees as a result of the Company committing to a reduction in workforce expected to occur in fiscal 2007 and 2008. In addition, higher depreciation expense and other costs associated with the development of the new printing plants in the United Kingdom also contributed to this decrease. The Company expects annualized personnel cost savings of approximately $65 million when the U.K. workforce reduction is completed. Also contributing to this decrease in operating income was the lower advertising revenue noted above, the absence of the TSL Education Ltd. division noted above, increased costs associated with employees and increased newsprint costs. For the fiscal year ended June 30, 2006, the Australian newspapers revenues increased 9%, as compared to fiscal 2005, mainly due to the consolidation of the results of QPL beginning in November 2004. Also contributing to this increase were improved display and classified advertising revenues, along with the impact of cover price increases at the major weekend newspapers. The increase in Operating income of 8% for the fiscal year ended June 30, 2006 as compared to fiscal 2005, was primarily attributable to the consolidation of QPL beginning in November 2004. Book Publishing (5% and 6% of the Company consolidated revenues in fiscal years 2006 and 2005, respectively) For the fiscal year ended June 30, 2006, revenues at the Book Publishing segment decreased by $15 million, or 1%, from fiscal 2005 as fiscal 2005 included the effect of significant sales of The Purpose Driven Life . During 54 Table of Contents the fiscal year ended June 30, 2006, HarperCollins had 109 titles on The New York Times Bestseller List with 14 titles reaching the number one position. Notable bestsellers during fiscal 2006 included: Marley and Me by John Grogan, Freakonomics by Steven D. Levitt and Stephen J. Dubner, The Purpose Driven Life by Rick Warren, YOU: The Owner Manual by Michael F. Roizen and Mehmet C. Oz, M.D. and The Chronicles of Narnia by C. S. Lewis. Operating income for the Book Publishing segment for the fiscal year ended June 30, 2006 increased by $3 million or 2% from fiscal 2005. The increase in Operating income was primarily due to higher level of more profitable backlist sales in the General Books group, when compared to the corresponding period of fiscal 2005. Other (6% and 5% of the Company consolidated revenues in fiscal 2006 and 2005, respectively) For the fiscal year ended June 30, 2006, revenues at the Other segment increased $274 million, or 24%, as compared to fiscal 2005. The increase was primarily driven by incremental revenues from the FIM acquisitions. The Operating loss at the Other segment decreased $27 million, or 15%, for the fiscal year ended June 30, 2006 as compared to fiscal 2005, primarily as a result of fiscal 2005 results including reorganization costs in connection with the Reorganization partially offset by the inclusion of the fiscal 2006 FIM operating losses, principally resulting from employee retention expenses and amortization of purchased intangible assets.

Overview For the fiscal year ended June 30, 2005, the Company revenues increased $3,057 million from $20,802 million for the fiscal year ended June 30, 2004 to $23,859 million. This 15% increase was primarily due 55 Table of Contents to revenue increases at the Filmed Entertainment, Newspaper, Direct Broadcast Satellite Television, Television and Cable Network Programming segments. Operating expenses increased approximately 14% for the fiscal year ended June 30, 2005 from fiscal 2004, primarily due to increased theatrical releasing costs, home entertainment marketing and manufacturing costs and amortization of production and participation costs at the Filmed Entertainment segment and increased sports programming and entertainment programming costs at the Television, Cable Network Programming and Direct Broadcast Satellite Television segments. Selling, general and administrative expenses increased approximately 10% from fiscal 2004 primarily due to increased subscriber acquisition costs at SKY Italia and increased employee costs in support of the Company growing businesses. Depreciation and amortization increased approximately 15% primarily due to accelerated depreciation recognized on printing plant assets in the United Kingdom and amortization on the intangible assets acquired in the FEG acquisition. In fiscal 2005, the Company also recognized Other operating charges of $49 million in relation to the Reorganization. For the fiscal year ended June 30, 2005, Operating income increased $633 million to $3,564 million from fiscal 2004. These increases were primarily due to improved revenue increases noted above. Interest expense, net Interest expense increased $4 million from fiscal 2004 due primarily to interest on the Company issuance of $1.75 billion in Senior Notes in December 2004 partially offset by increased interest income on higher cash balances. Equity earnings of affiliates Equity earnings of affiliates of $355 million for the fiscal year ended June 30, 2005 increased $185 million from $170 million for the fiscal year ended June 30, 2004, primarily due to increased contributions from British Sky Broadcasting Group plc ( BSkyB ) and the comparatively favorable impact from foreign currency fluctuations reported by the Latin American DBS platforms, partially offset by increased losses at DIRECTV. For the years ended June 30, 2005 2004 Change % Change ($ millions) The Company share of equity earnings (losses) of affiliates principally consists of: British Sky Broadcasting Group plc $ 374 $ 265 $ 109 41% The DIRECTV Group, Inc.

The Company DIRECTV purchase price allocation reflected the fair value of the PanAmSat, SPACEWAY and Hughes Network Systems, Inc. assets at the date of acquisition, which approximate DIRECTV revised carrying amounts. As such, portions of the impacts of the preceding items were recognized by the Company through its purchase price allocation, and were appropriately excluded from its share of DIRECTV losses for fiscal 2005. The resulting excess has been allocated to finite-lived intangibles, which are being amortized over lives ranging from six to 20 years, and to certain indefinite-lived intangibles and goodwill, which are not subject to amortization in accordance with Statement of Financial Accounting Standards ( SFAS ) No. 142, Goodwill and Other Intangible Assets. 56 Table of Contents Other, net Footnote reference For the years ended June 30, 2005 2004 (in millions) Loss on sale of Regional Programming Partners 3 $ (85 ) $ Loss on sale of Sky Multi-Country Partners 6 (55 ) Gain on sale of Rogers Sportsnet 6 39 Gain on sale of Sky PerfecTV! 6 105 Monarchy dividend (a) 52 World Trade Center insurance settlement 26 Change in fair value of Exchangeable securities (b) 10 246 18 Other 33 (15 ) Total Other, net $ 178 $ 186 (a) During fiscal 2004, the Company received a special dividend from Monarchy Enterprises Holdings B.V., a cost based investment.

The effective tax rate for the fiscal year ended June 30, 2005 was lower than the U.S. statutory rate primarily due to the resolution of foreign income tax audits during fiscal 2005. Excluding this tax benefit, the effective tax rate was 38% for the fiscal year ended June 30, 2005 and was higher than the U.S. statutory rate primarily due to state and foreign income taxes. Net income For the fiscal year ended June 30, 2005, the Company reported net income of $2,128 million as compared to $1,533 million for the fiscal year ended June 30, 2004.

This increase was primarily due to higher worldwide home entertainment revenues and worldwide theatrical revenues. Higher home entertainment revenues reflect the strong worldwide performances of The Day After Tomorrow, Garfield, Dodgeball, Alien vs. Predator , I, Robot, the Star Wars Trilogy, and the distribution fees earned for The Passion of the Christ. In addition, television titles such as 24, The Simpsons and Family Guy also contributed to this increase. The Company DVD revenues rose approximately 32% for the fiscal year ended June 30, 2005 over fiscal 2004, with 81% and 19% of DVD revenues generated from the sale and distribution of film titles and television titles, respectively. The theatrical revenue increase was driven by several strong worldwide theatrical releases, including I, Robot, Alien vs. Predator, Robots, Hide & Seek , Sideways , and Kingdom of Heaven, as well as continued contributions from fiscal 2004 releases, including Dodgeball, Garfield and The Day After Tomorrow . Fiscal 2004 included the theatrical releases League of Extraordinary Gentlemen, Cheaper by the Dozen, Master and Commander: The Far Side of the World, 28 Days Later , Man on Fire, The Day After Tomorrow, Garfield, and Dodgeball . For the fiscal year ended June 30, 2005, the Filmed Entertainment segment reported Operating income of $1,058 million as compared to $905 million in fiscal 2004. This improvement was due to the revenue increases noted above, as well as the distribution fees earned for Star Wars Episode III: Revenge of the Sith and Mr. and Mrs. Smith , partially offset by increased theatrical releasing costs, home entertainment marketing and manufacturing costs, amortization of production and participation costs directly associated with the increase in revenues noted above and the disappointing theatrical release of Flight of the Phoenix . 58 Table of Contents Television (22% and 24% of the Company consolidated revenues in fiscal years 2005 and 2004, respectively) The Television segment reported revenue of $5,338 million for the fiscal year ended June 30, 2005 as compared to $5,027 million in fiscal 2004. Operating income at the Television segment was $952 million as compared to $950 million in fiscal 2004. Revenues for the fiscal year ended June 30, 2005 at the Company U.S. television operations increased approximately 6% from fiscal 2004. The Company experienced increased advertising revenues from the telecast of the Super Bowl and Daytona 500, which were not telecast on FOX in fiscal 2004 and higher pricing for NFL regular season and prime time broadcasts. This increase was partially offset by a decrease in prime time ratings as compared to fiscal 2004, advertising weakness in the U.S. markets, as well as the adverse impact of the transition to LPMs on ratings. Operating income for the fiscal year ended June 30, 2005 at the Company U.S. television operations decreased approximately 7% as compared to fiscal 2004. This is due primarily to increased sports programming costs for the Super Bowl and Daytona 500 and increased entertainment program costs for returning series. Partially offsetting this increase in Operating loss are lower advertising expenses, lower priced renewals of expired syndicated product and lower music license fees. Revenues and operating income for the fiscal year ended June 30, 2005 at the Company international television operations increased from fiscal 2004. These increases were primarily driven by increased advertising revenues due to growth in India and increased subscription revenues due to the launch of new channels in India. Cable Network Programming (11% and 12% of the Company consolidated revenues in fiscal 2005 and 2004, respectively) Total revenues for the Cable Network Programming segment increased by $279 million or approximately 12% from $2,409 million to $2,688 million for the fiscal year ended June 30, 2005. This increase reflected improved results across all of the Cable Network Programming channels. Fox News, FX and the RSN revenues increased 20%, 18% and 9%, respectively, over fiscal 2004. At Fox News, advertising revenues increased 22% over fiscal 2004 primarily driven by higher national pricing and higher volume. Net affiliate revenue increased 14%, which can be attributed to an increase in subscribers and higher rates per subscriber as compared to fiscal 2004. As of June 30, 2005, Fox News reached approximately 88 million Nielsen households, a 3% increase over fiscal 2004. At FX, advertising revenues increased 18% over fiscal 2004 due to higher ratings and improved pricing. Net affiliate revenue increased 18% over fiscal 2004, reflecting an increase in subscribers and higher average rates per subscriber. As of June 30, 2005, FX reached approximately 87 million Nielsen households, a 4% increase over fiscal 2004. At the RSNs, net affiliate revenue increased 11% over fiscal 2004 primarily due to an increase in DBS subscribers and higher average rates per subscriber, net of allowances related to the cancellation of the 2004-05 NHL season, as well as the additional revenue from the consolidation of the RSNs in Florida and Ohio in April 2005. Advertising revenues increased 3% due to the consolidation of RSNs in Florida and Ohio in April 2005, which more than offset the negative impact from the absence of NHL telecasts as a result of the cancellation of the NHL season. The Cable Network Programming segment reported operating income of $702 million, an increase of $214 million over fiscal 2004. This improvement was primarily driven by the revenue increases noted above, as well as lower programming costs at the RSNs due to the NHL season cancellation and the absence of losses from the Los Angeles Dodgers ( Dodgers ) due to its sale in fiscal 2004. Partially offsetting these improvements were higher programming expenses for original series and movies at FX, higher programming and news gathering costs at Fox News and for additional MLB and NBA events at the RSNs. 59 Table of Contents Direct Broadcast Satellite Television (10% and 8% of the Company consolidated revenues in fiscal 2005 and 2004, respectively) For the fiscal year ended June 30, 2005, SKY Italia revenues increased to $2,313 million from $1,665 million in fiscal 2004. The 39% revenue growth was primarily driven by the addition of approximately 650,000 net new subscribers during fiscal 2005 which resulted in SKY Italia subscriber base growing to approximately 3.3 million at June 30, 2005. SKY Italia also improved its subscriber churn rate to approximately 9% from approximately 19% in fiscal 2004. Also contributing to revenue growth during the fiscal year ended June 30, 2005 was an increase in ARPU from approximately 42 in fiscal 2004 to approximately 44 in fiscal 2005. This increase was driven by subscribers opting for more premium programming. SAC increased from 204 in fiscal 2004 to 243 in fiscal 2005 primarily due to the Company free installation program implemented in fiscal 2005. For the fiscal year ended June 30, 2005, the operating loss at SKY Italia of $173 million improved by 38% as compared to the loss of $277 million in fiscal 2004. The revenue growth was partially offset by increased programming spending primarily due to the broadcast of additional soccer matches and movie titles, as well as the addition of ten new entertainment and news channels on the basic programming tier. Additionally, the Company incurred costs associated with the one-time swap-out of set-top boxes which were using outdated encryption software. In fiscal 2005, the weakening of the U.S. dollar against the Euro resulted in approximately 6% of the increase in revenue and operating loss as compared to fiscal 2004. Magazines and Inserts (4% and 5% of the Company consolidated revenues in fiscal 2005 and 2004, respectively) For the fiscal year ended June 30, 2005, revenues at the Magazines and Inserts segment increased $89 million to $1,068 million from $979 million in fiscal 2004. This was primarily the result of higher demand for in-store advertising products in supermarkets in the United States. Operating income increased to $298 million in fiscal 2005 from $271 million in fiscal 2004. This increase is primarily due to the revenue increases noted above. Newspapers (17% and 16% of the Company consolidated revenues in fiscal 2005 and 2004, respectively) The Newspapers segment reported revenue of $4,083 million for the fiscal year ended June 30, 2005 as compared to $3,425 million in fiscal 2004. For the fiscal year ended June 30, 2005, Operating income at the Newspapers segment was $740 million, an increase of 31% from $565 million in fiscal 2004 resulting from increases at the Company Australian operations and a recovery related to the refurbishment of its U.S. printing plant, partially offset by decreases at the Company U.K. operations. For the fiscal year ended June 30, 2005, U.K. newspapers revenues increased approximately 11% primarily due to increased circulation and advertising revenues and the weakening of the U.S. dollar against the British pound sterling. Circulation revenue increased over the corresponding period of fiscal 2004 due to the national rollout of the compact product at The Times , as well as cover price increase on the Company other U.K. national papers. This increase in circulation revenue was partly offset by lower net circulation at The Sun, The Sunday Times and The News of the World . Advertising revenue was higher due to increases at the Company U.K. national newspapers primarily due to a higher volume on color advertisements and increased commercial inserts. This increase in advertising revenue was partially offset by a decrease at The Times due to lower volumes and prices. Operating income decreased for the fiscal year ended June 30, 2005 as compared to fiscal 2004. This decrease is primarily due to increased depreciation and other costs associated with the development of new printing plants in the United Kingdom. Also contributing to the decrease in Operating income are increased operating costs resulting from increased production, increased pagination and higher newsprint costs. These additional costs were partly offset by lower promotion costs in fiscal 2005, as well as the weakening of the U.S. 60 Table of Contents dollar against the British pound sterling. During the fiscal year ended June 30, 2005, the weakening of the U.S. dollar against the British pound sterling resulted in approximately 7% increases to both revenues and Operating income as compared to fiscal 2004. For the fiscal year ended June 30, 2005, the Company Australian newspapers revenues increased 34% due to the consolidation of the results of QPL in November 2004, improved display and classified revenues and the weakening of the U.S. dollar against the Australian dollar. The advertising revenue increases were driven by the continued strong economic conditions in Australia and new sales initiatives, resulting in gains in national, retail and employment display and the employment and real estate classified sections. Operating income increased 58% as compared to fiscal 2004 primarily due to the revenue increases noted above. During the fiscal year ended June 30, 2005, the weakening U.S. dollar resulted in increases of approximately 5% in revenues and operating income, noted above, as compared to the fiscal year ended June 30, 2004. Book Publishing (6% of the Company consolidated revenues in fiscal 2005 and 2004, respectively) HarperCollins recorded revenues of $1,327 million in fiscal 2005, a $51 million, or 4%, increase from revenues of $1,276 million in fiscal 2004. The revenue increase is primarily attributable to strong performances in the General Books, Childrens and United Kingdom divisions including the strong sales of the 11 titles in Lemony Snicket A Series of Unfortunate Events . In fiscal 2005, HarperCollins had 103 titles on The New York Times Bestseller List with 15 titles reaching the number one position compared to 97 titles on The New York Times Bestseller List for fiscal 2004. Other notable releases and strong titles in fiscal 2005 included The Purpose Driven Life by Rick Warren, State Of Fear by Michael Crichton, YOU: The Owners Manual by Michael F. Roizen and Mehmet C. Oz, M.D., American Soldier by Tommy Franks, Winning by Jack Welch, and Freakonomics by Steven Levitt and Stephen Dunbar. Operating income was $164 million in fiscal 2005, an increase of 4% from fiscal 2004 due to the revenue increases noted above. Other (5% and 4% of the Company consolidated revenues in fiscal 2005 and 2004, respectively) For the fiscal year ended June 30, 2005, revenues at the Other segment increased from $834 million for fiscal 2004 to $1,123 million. Included in this increase were higher revenues at NDS and GCC. The increase in NDS revenues was due to increased smartcard shipments, as well as an increase in total authorized smartcards in use as compared to fiscal 2004. The increase in GCC revenues was due to the International Cricket Council Champions Trophy 2004 that was held in September 2004 with no comparable event in fiscal 2004. For the fiscal year ended June 30, 2005, the Other segment reported Operating losses of $177 million as compared to $128 million in fiscal 2004. The increased loss was due to costs related to the Reorganization and increased research and development costs at NDS, partially offset by the revenue increases noted above. LIQUIDITY AND CAPITAL RESOURCES Current Financial Condition The Company principal source of liquidity is internally generated funds; however, the Company has access to the worldwide capital markets, a $1.75 billion Revolving Credit Facility and various film financing alternatives to supplement its cash flows. The availability under the Revolving Credit Facility as of June 30, 2006 was reduced by letters of credit issued which totaled approximately $180 million. Also, as of June 30, 2006, the Company had consolidated cash and cash equivalents of approximately $5.8 billion. The Company believes that cash flows from operations will be adequate for the Company to conduct its operations. The Company internally generated funds are highly dependent upon the state of the advertising market and public acceptance of film and television products. Any significant decline in the advertising market or the performance of the Company films could adversely impact its cash flows from operations which could require the Company to seek other sources of funds including proceeds from the sale of certain assets or other alternative sources. The principal uses of cash that affect the Company liquidity position include the following: investments in the production and distribution of new feature films and television programs; the acquisition of and payments 61 Table of Contents under programming rights for entertainment and sports programming; paper purchases; operational expenditures; capital expenditures; interest expense; income tax payments; investments in associated entities; dividends; acquisitions and stock repurchases. Sources and Uses of Cash Fiscal 2006 vs. Fiscal 2005 Net cash provided by operating activities for the fiscal years ended June 30, 2006 and 2005 is as follows (in millions): Years Ended June 30, 2006 2005 Net cash provided by operating activities $ 3,257 $ 3,371 The decrease in net cash provided by operating activities primarily reflects lower cash collections from worldwide home entertainment product primarily driven by the decrease in worldwide home entertainment revenues at the Filmed Entertainment segment as compared to fiscal 2005. In addition, also contributing to the decrease was higher sports rights and higher tax payments during fiscal 2006 as compared to fiscal 2005. Net cash used in investing activities for the fiscal years ended June 30, 2006 and 2005 is as follows (in millions): Years Ended June 30, 2006 2005 Cash flows used in investing activities: Property, plant and equipment, net of acquisitions $ (976 ) $ (901 ) Acquisitions, net of cash acquired (1,989 ) (69 ) Investments in equity affiliates (89 ) (106 ) Proceeds from sale of investments and other non-current assets 412 800 Proceeds from disposition of discontinued operations 610 Other investments (28 ) (27 ) Net cash used in investing activities $ (2,060 ) $ (303 ) Cash used in investing activities during fiscal 2006 was higher than the cash used in investing activities during fiscal 2005. The increase is primarily due to the acquisitions of Intermix Media, Inc., IGN Entertainment, Inc. and a regional cable sports channel during fiscal 2006. The cash used in investing activities during fiscal 2006 was partially offset by proceeds received from the disposition of discontinued operations as the Company sold its TSL Education Ltd. division for approximately $395 million in cash consideration in October 2005 and its Sky Radio Limited division for approximately $215 million in cash consideration in April 2006. Proceeds from the sale of investments and non-current assets primarily represent cash received for the sale of Innova and China Netcom during fiscal 2006 and cash received in advance on the sale of Sky Brasil to DIRECTV and the sale of other non-strategic investments during fiscal 2005. The Company has evaluated, and expects to continue to evaluate, possible acquisitions and dispositions of certain businesses. Such transactions may be material and may involve cash, the Company securities or the assumption of additional indebtedness. 62 Table of Contents Net cash provided by financing activities for the fiscal years ended June 30, 2006 and 2005 is as follows (in millions): Years Ended June 30, 2006 2005 Cash flows used in financing activities: Borrowings $ 1,159 $ 1,841 Repayment of borrowings (865 ) (2,110 ) Issuances of shares 232 88 Repurchase of shares (2,027 ) (535 ) Dividends paid (431 ) (240 ) Cash on deposit 275 Net cash used in financing activities $ (1,932 ) $ (681 ) Net cash used in financing activities during fiscal 2006 increased from net cash used in financing activities in fiscal 2005 primarily due to the stock repurchase program. The increase was partially offset by an increase in borrowings net of repayments during fiscal 2006, as compared to fiscal 2005. The total dividends declared related to fiscal 2006 results were $0.12 per share of Class A Common Stock and $0.10 per share of Class B Common Stock. In August 2006, the Company declared the final dividend on fiscal 2006 results of $0.06 per share for Class A Common Stock and $0.05 per share for Class B Common Stock. This together with the interim dividend of $0.06 per share of Class A Common Stock and a dividend of $0.05 per share of Class B Common Stock constitute the total dividend relating to fiscal 2005. Based on the number of shares outstanding as of June 30, 2006 the total aggregate cash dividends expected to be paid to shareholders in fiscal 2007 is approximately $353 million. Sources and Uses of Cash Fiscal 2005 vs. Fiscal 2004 Net cash provided by operating activities for the fiscal years ended June 30, 2005 and 2004 is as follows (in millions): Years Ended June 30, 2005 2004 Net cash provided by operating activities $ 3,371 $ 2,395 The increase in net cash provided by operating activities reflects higher operating results and resulting cash collections primarily from increased sale of home entertainment product and lower cash spent on the production of feature films at the Filmed Entertainment segment during the fiscal year ended June 30, 2005. These increases were offset by higher sports rights and film participation payments and higher interest due to an increase in total borrowings. The higher sports rights payments reflects contractually scheduled increases on the Company national and international sports contracts, as well as the renewal of several sports teams local rights agreements. Net cash used in investing activities for the fiscal years ended June 30, 2005 and 2004 is as follows (in millions): Years Ended June 30, 2005 2004 Cash flows (used in) provided by investing activities: Purchases of property, plant and equipment $ (901 ) $ (361 ) Acquisitions, net of cash acquired (69 ) (202 ) Investments in associated entities, net (106 ) (3,237 ) Proceeds from sale of investments and non-current assets 800 869 Other (27 ) (91 ) Net cash used in investing activities $ (303 ) $ (3,022 ) 63 Table of Contents Cash used in investing activities during fiscal 2005 was lower than fiscal 2004 due to the Company purchase of a 34% investment in DIRECTV for approximately $6.8 billion of which $3.1 billion represented the cash consideration in fiscal 2004. Property, plant and equipment acquired primarily represents cash used for the purchase of equipment that is rented to customers at the Direct Broadcast Satellite Television segment and cash used by the Newspaper segment in connection with the investment in new printing presses as discussed below. Proceeds from the sale of non-current assets primarily represent cash received in advance on the sale of Sky Brasil to DIRECTV and the sale of other non-strategic investments during fiscal 2005 and cash received on the sale of SKY PerfectTV! during fiscal 2004. Net cash provided by financing activities for the fiscal years ended June 30, 2005 and 2004 is as follows (in millions): Years Ended June 30, 2005 2004 Cash flows (used in) provided by financing activities: Borrowings $ 1,841 $ 548 Repayment of borrowings (2,110 ) (943 ) Issuances of shares 88 580 Repurchase of shares (535 ) Dividends paid (240 ) (202 ) Cash on deposit 275 162 Net cash (used in) provided by financing activities $ (681 ) $ 145 Net cash used in financing activities during fiscal 2005 changed from net cash provided by financing activities in the corresponding period of fiscal 2004 primarily due to the implementation of the stock repurchase program in fiscal 2005 and the absence of the stock offering that occurred in fiscal 2004. The borrowing repayments during fiscal 2005 included the retirement of debt assumed in the acquisition of the Cruden Group of companies, the Eurobonds, the perpetual preference shares and the film financing facility. (See Notes 3 and 9 to the accompanying Consolidated Financial Statements of News Corporation for further detail.) In fiscal 2005, the Company issued $1.75 billion in Senior Notes which offset the repayments noted above. The cash received for the issuance of shares was due to stock options exercised by employees. Included in this amount was approximately $12 million for options issued over NDS shares. The total dividends declared related to fiscal 2005 results were $0.12 per share of Class A Common Stock and $0.10 per share of Class B Common Stock. In August 2005, the Company declared the final dividend on fiscal 2005 results of $0.07 per share for Class A Common Stock and $0.08 per share for Class B Common Stock. This together with the interim dividend of $0.05 per share of Class A Common Stock and a dividend of $0.02 per share of Class B Common Stock constitute the total dividend relating to fiscal 2005.

LYONs In February 2001, the Company issued Liquid Yield Option Notes ( LYONs ) which pay no interest and have an aggregate principal amount at maturity of $1,515 million representing a yield of 3.5% per annum on the issue price. The holders may exchange the notes at any time into Class A Common Stock or, at the option of the Company, the cash equivalent thereof at a fixed exchange rate of 24.2966 shares of Class A Common Stock per $1,000 note. The LYONs are redeemable at the option of the holders on February 28, 2011 and February 28, 2016 at a price of $706.82 and $840.73, respectively. The Company, at its election, may satisfy the redemption amounts in cash, Class A Common Stock or any combination thereof. The Company can redeem the notes in cash at any time on or after February 28, 2006 at specified redemption amounts. On February 28, 2006, 92% of the LYONs were redeemed for cash at the specified redemption amount of $594.25 per LYON. Accordingly, the Company paid an aggregate of approximately $831 million to the holders of the LYONs that had exercised this redemption option. The pro-rata portion of unamortized deferred financing costs relating to the redeemed LYONs approximating $13 million was recognized and included in Other, net in the consolidated statement of operations for the fiscal year ended June 30, 2006. 65 Table of Contents Ratings of the Public Debt The table below summarizes the Company credit ratings as of June 30, 2006. Rating Agency Senior Debt Outlook Moody Baa 2 Stable S&P BBB Stable Revolving Credit Agreement On June 27, 2003, News America Incorporated ( NAI ), a subsidiary of the Company, entered into a new $1.75 billion Five Year Credit Agreement (the Credit Agreement ) with Citibank N.A., as administrative agent, JP Morgan Chase Bank, as syndication agent, and the lenders named therein. News Corporation, FEG Holdings, Inc., Fox Entertainment Group, Inc., News America Marketing FSI, Inc., News Publishing Australia Limited and News Australia Holdings Pty Limited are guarantors (the Guarantors ) under the Credit Agreement. The Credit Agreement provides a $1.75 billion revolving credit facility with a sub-limit of $600 million available for the issuance of letters of credit, and expires on June 30, 2008. Borrowings are in U.S. dollars only, while letters of credit are issuable in U.S. dollars or Euros. The significant terms of the Credit Agreement include the requirement that the Company maintain specific gearing and interest coverage ratios and limitations on secured indebtedness. The Company pays a facility fee of 0.15% regardless of facility usage. The Company pays interest of a margin over LIBOR for borrowings and a letter of credit fee of 0.60%. The Company pays additional fees of 0.125% if borrowings under the facility exceed 25% of the committed facility. The interest and fees are based on the Company current debt rating. At June 30, 2006, letters of credit representing approximately $180 million were issued under the Credit Agreement. Commitments and Guarantees The Company has commitments under certain firm contractual arrangements ( firm commitments ) to make future payments. These firm commitments secure the future rights to various assets and services to be used in the normal course of operations. The following table summarizes the Company material firm commitments as of June 30, 2006. As of June 30, 2006 Payments Due by Period Total 1 year 2-3 years 4-5 years After 5 years (in millions) Contracts for Capital Expenditure Land and buildings $ 256 $ 227 $ 29 $ $ Plant and machinery 557 360 197 Operating leases (a) Land and buildings 3,039 232 425 363 2,019 Plant and machinery 997 202 289 163 343 Other commitments Borrowings 9,855 42 661 188 8,964 Exchangeable securities 1,572 1,444 128 News America Marketing (b) 464 96 167 104 97 Sports programming rights (c) 12,665 2,795 3,924 3,034 2,912 Entertainment programming rights 4,210 1,521 1,536 764 389 Other commitments and contractual obligations 1,095 521 489 84 1 Total commitments, borrowings and contractual obligations $ 34,710 $ 5,996 $ 7,717 $ 6,144 $ 14,853 66 Table of Contents The Company also has certain contractual arrangements in relation to certain investees that would require the Company to make payments or provide funding if certain circumstances occur ( contingent guarantees ). The Company does not expect that these contingent guarantees will result in any material amounts being paid by the Company in the foreseeable future. The timing of the amounts presented in the table below reflect when the maximum contingent guarantees will expire and does not indicate that the Company expects to incur an obligation to make payments during that time frame. As of June 30, 2006 Total Amounts Committed Amount of Guarantees Expiration Per Period Contingent Guarantees 1 year 2-3 years 4-5 years After 5 years (in millions) Transponder lease (d) $ 321 $ 26 $ 53 $ 53 $ 189 Star Channel Japan (e) 71 71 Sky Brasil credit agreement (f) 210 210 Other 38 28 10 $ 640 $ 125 $ 273 $ 53 $ 189 (a) The Company leases transponders, office facilities, warehouse facilities, equipment and microwave transmitters used to carry broadcast signals. These leases, which are classified as operating leases, expire at certain dates through fiscal 2036. In addition, the Company leases various printing plants, which leases expire at various dates through fiscal 2095. (b) News America Marketing ( NAMG ), a leading provider of in-store marketing products and services primarily to consumer packaged goods manufacturers, enters into agreements with retailers to occupy space for the display of point of sale advertising. (c) The Company current contract with MLB grants the Company rights to telecast certain regular season and all post-season MLB games. The contract began with the 2001 MLB season and ends with the 2006 MLB season. For the duration of the term of its contract with MLB, the Company has sublicensed telecast rights to certain MLB post-season games to The Walt Disney Company, and is entitled to be paid a sublicense fee over the remaining term. The amounts reflected on the above table have not been reduced by the sublicense. In July 2006, the Company entered into a new seven-year deal with MLB to broadcast various regular season games, one League Championship Series each year and the World Series starting with the 2007 MLB season through the 2013 MLB season. Sports programming rights as of June 30, 2006 do not reflect the new MLB deal. Under the Company contract with the NFL, remaining future minimum payments for program rights to broadcast certain football games are payable over the remaining term of the contract through fiscal 2012. The Company contracts with the NASCAR give the Company rights to broadcast certain races and ancillary content through calendar year 2014. The Company acquired the exclusive rights to transmit and exploit the broadcast of the 2007 Cricket World Cup and other related events through fiscal 2007. The Company has guaranteed its subsidiaries obligations under this contract and has been granted the first right of refusal and the last right to match the highest bid received for the broadcast rights in their respective territories. In addition, the Company has certain other local sports broadcasting rights. (d) The Company has guaranteed a transponder lease for an associated company operating in Latin America. The guarantee expires in fiscal 2019. The Company has agreed to sell its investment to DIRECTV and upon the closing of the sale, the Company will be released from the transponder lease guarantee (See Note 6 Investments and Note 24 Subsequent Events to the accompanying Consolidated Financial Statements of News Corporation). 67 Table of Contents (e) The Company has guaranteed a bank loan facility of $71 million for an affiliate. The facility covers a term loan of $53 million ( 6.1 billion) which matures in June 2007, and an agreement for an overdraft with $18 million ( 2.0 billion) outstanding. The Company would be liable under this guarantee, to the extent of default by the affiliate. (f) In August 2004, the Company guaranteed the obligations of Sky Brasil, an equity affiliate of the Company, under a $210 million three-year credit agreement with JP Morgan Chase Bank and Citibank N.A. (See Note 6 Investments and Note 24 Subsequent Events to the accompanying Consolidated Financial Statements of News Corporation). As of June 30, 2006 the Company was contractually obligated to approximately $576 million and $71 million in the United Kingdom and Australia, respectively, for new printing plants and related costs. All firm commitments related to these projects are included in the capital expenditure lines disclosed in the commitments table above. In accordance with SFAS No. 87, Employers Accounting for Pensions, and SFAS No. 106, Employers Accounting for Postretirement Benefits Other Than Pensions, the total accrued benefit liability for pension and other postretirement benefit plans recognized as of June 30, 2006 was $342 million. (See Note 16 Pensions and Other Postretirement Benefits to the accompanying Consolidated Financial Statements of News Corporation). This amount is impacted by, among other items, statutory funding levels, changes in plan demographics and assumptions, and investment return on plan assets. Because of the current overall funded status of the Company material plans, the accrued liability does not represent expected near-term liquidity needs and accordingly the Company did not include this amount in the contractual obligations table. The Company funds its U.S. qualified pension plans in accordance with Employee Retirement Income Security Act regulations for determining the minimum annual required contribution and in accordance with Internal Revenue Service regulations for determining the maximum annual allowable tax deduction. The minimum required contribution for the Company primary qualified U.S. pension plans for the 2006 plan year is $0 and is anticipated to remain $0 for at least the next several years due to voluntary contributions made to the plan over the recent years. Therefore, the Company did not include any amounts as a contractual obligation in the above table. The Company does however anticipate contributing additional voluntary amounts but such contributions will not be more than the maximum deductible amount. The Company international pension plans are funded in accordance with local laws and income tax regulations. The Company does not expect minimum annual requirements to be material in 2007. Therefore, no amounts have been included in the table above. The Company does however anticipate making additional voluntary contributions to qualified pension plans in 2007, but not more than the maximum deductible amounts. As of June 30, 2006, the projected benefit obligation of the pension plans was $2,061 million, and the fair value of plan assets was $1,903 million. A portion of this underfunding is attributable to the unfunded nonqualified pension plans. These nonqualified pension plans provide supplemental retirement benefits that are generally not permitted to be funded through a qualified plan because of regulatory limits. Disclosure of amounts in the above table regarding expected benefit payments for the Company pension plans and its other postretirement benefit plans cannot be properly reflected due to the ongoing nature of the obligations of these plans. Please see Note 16 to the accompanying Consolidated Financial Statements of News Corporation for additional information on expected future benefit payments. Contingencies The Company wholly-owned subsidiary, News Out of Home owns and operates outdoor advertising companies located primarily in Eastern Europe and also owns 68% of Media Support Services Limited, an outdoor advertising company with operating subsidiaries located in Russia. The minority stockholders of Media Support Services Limited had the right to sell a portion of their interests to News Out of Home during the first 68 Table of Contents quarter of fiscal 2007 and have exercised those rights. The minority stockholders have the right to sell the remainder of their interests after June 2010. The Company believes that the exercise of these sale rights, if any, will not have a material effect on its consolidated financial condition, future results of operations or liquidity. The Company experiences routine litigation in the normal course of its business. The Company believes that none of its pending litigation will have a material adverse effect on its consolidated financial condition, future results of operations or liquidity. The Company operations are subject to tax in various domestic and international jurisdictions and as a matter of course, the Company is regularly audited by federal, state and foreign tax authorities. The Company believes it has appropriately accrued for the expected outcome of all pending tax matters and does not currently anticipate that the ultimate resolution of pending tax matters will have a material adverse effect on its consolidated financial condition, future results of operations or liquidity. Related Party Transactions Immediately prior to and as part of the Reorganization, the Company acquired from certain trusts, the beneficiaries of which include Mr. K.R. Murdoch, members of his family and certain charities ( the Murdoch Trusts ), the 58% shareholding in QPL which was not already owned by the Company predecessor through the acquisition of the Cruden Group of companies ( the Cruden/QPL Transaction ). The principal assets of the Cruden Group were shares of News Corporation and a 58% interest in QPL. QPL owns a publishing business which includes two metropolitan and eight regional newspapers in Queensland, Australia, as well as shares in News Corporation. Following this transaction, Mr. K.R. Murdoch and the Murdoch Trusts owned approximately 29.5% of the Company Class B Common Stock. CRITICAL ACCOUNTING POLICIES An accounting policy is considered to be critical if it is important to the Company financial condition and results, and if it requires significant judgment and estimates on the part of management in its application. The development and selection of these critical accounting policies have been determined by management of the Company and the related disclosures have been reviewed with the Audit Committee of the Company Board of Directors. For a summary of all of the Company significant accounting policies, see Note 2 to the accompanying Consolidated Financial Statements of News Corporation. Use of Estimates The preparation of the Company consolidated financial statements in conformity with GAAP requires management to make estimates and assumptions that affect the amounts that are reported in the consolidated financial statements and accompanying disclosures. Although these estimates are based on management best knowledge of current events and actions that the company may undertake in the future, actual results may differ from the estimates. Revenue Recognition Filmed Entertainment Revenues from distribution of feature films are recognized in accordance with Statement of Position No. 00-2, Accounting by Producers or Distributors of Films ( SOP 00-2 ). Revenues from the theatrical distribution of motion pictures are recognized as they are exhibited and revenues from home video and DVD sales, net of a reserve for estimated returns, together with related costs, are recognized on the date that video and DVD units are made widely available for sale by retailers and all Company-imposed restrictions on the sale of video and DVD units have expired. Revenues from television distribution are recognized when the motion picture or television program is made available to the licensee for broadcast. Management bases its estimates of ultimate revenue for each film on the historical performance of similar films, incorporating factors such as the past box office record of the lead actors and actresses, the genre of the 69 Table of Contents film, pre-release market research (including test market screenings) and the expected number of theaters in which the film will be released. Management updates such estimates based on information available on the actual results of each film through its life cycle. License agreements for the telecast of theatrical and television product in the broadcast network, syndicated television and cable television markets are routinely entered into in advance of their available date for telecast. Cash received and amounts billed in connection with such contractual rights for which revenue is not yet recognizable is classified as deferred revenue. Because deferred revenue generally relates to contracts for the licensing of theatrical and television product which have already been produced, the recognition of revenue for such completed product is principally only dependent upon the commencement of the availability period for telecast under the terms of the related licensing agreement. Television, Cable Network Programming and Direct Broadcast Satellite Advertising revenue is recognized as the commercials are aired, net of agency commissions. Subscriber fees received from subscribers, cable systems and DBS operators are recognized as revenue in the period that services are provided, net of amortization of cable distribution investments. The Company defers the cable distribution investments and amortizes the amounts on a straight-line basis over the contract period. Filmed Entertainment and Television Programming Costs Accounting for the production and distribution of motion pictures and television programming is in accordance with SOP 00-2, which requires management judgment as it relates to total revenues to be received and costs to be incurred throughout the life of each program or its license period. These judgments are used to determine the amortization of capitalized filmed entertainment and television programming costs, the expensing of participation and residual costs associated with revenues earned and any fair value adjustments. In accordance with SOP 00-2, the Company amortizes filmed entertainment and television programming costs using the individual-film-forecast method. Under the individual-film-forecast method, such programming costs are amortized for each film or television program in the ratio that current period actual revenue for such title bears to management estimated remaining unrecognized ultimate revenue as of the beginning of the current fiscal year to be recognized over approximately a six year period or operating profits to be realized from all media and markets for such title. Management regularly reviews, and revises when necessary, its total revenue estimates on a title-by-title basis, which may result in a change in the rate of amortization and/or a write down of the asset to fair value. The costs of national sports contracts at FOX and at the Cable Network Programming segment and for international sports rights agreements are charged to expense based on the ratio of each period operating profits to estimated total remaining operating profit of the contract. Estimates of total operating profit can change and accordingly, are reviewed periodically and amortization is adjusted as necessary. Such changes in the future could be material. The costs of local and regional sports contracts, which are for a specified number of events, are amortized on an event-by-event basis. Those costs, which are for a specified season, are amortized over the season on a straight-line basis, and if applicable, a portion of the cost is allocated to rebroadcasts. Original cable programming is amortized on an accelerated basis. Management regularly reviews, and revises when necessary, its total revenue estimates on a contract basis, which may result in a change in the rate of amortization and/or a write down of the asset to fair value. Property, Plant and Equipment Property, plant and equipment is recorded at cost and are depreciated on a straight-line method over the estimated useful lives of such assets. Changes in circumstances such as technological advances, changes to the 70 Table of Contents Company business model or capital strategy could result in the actual useful lives differing from the Company estimates. In those cases where the Company determines that the useful life of buildings and equipment should be shortened, the Company would depreciate the asset over its revised remaining useful life thereby increasing depreciation expense. Intangible Assets The Company has a significant amount of intangible assets, including goodwill, FCC licenses, and other copyright products and trademarks. Intangible assets acquired in business combinations are recorded at their estimated fair market value at the date of acquisition. Goodwill is recorded as the difference between the cost of acquiring an entity and the estimated fair values assigned to its tangible and identifiable intangible net assets and is assigned to one or more reporting units for purposes of testing for impairment. The judgments made in determining the estimated fair value assigned to each class of intangible assets acquired, their reporting unit, as well as their useful lives can significantly impact net income. The Company accounts for its business acquisitions under the purchase method of accounting. The total cost of acquisitions is allocated to the underlying net assets, based on their respective estimated fair values. The excess of the purchase price over the estimated fair values of the tangible net assets acquired is recorded as intangibles. Amounts recorded as goodwill are assigned to one or more reporting units. Determining the fair value of assets acquired and liabilities assumed requires management judgment and often involves the use of significant estimates and assumptions, including assumptions with respect to future cash inflows and outflows, discount rates, asset lives and market multiples, among other items. Identifying reporting units and assigning goodwill thereto requires judgment involving the aggregation of business units with similar economic characteristics and the identification of existing business units that benefit from the acquired goodwill. Carrying values of goodwill and intangible assets with indefinite lives are reviewed periodically for possible impairment in accordance with SFAS No. 142, Goodwill and Other Intangible Assets ( SFAS No. 142 ). The Company impairment review is based on, among other methods, a discounted cash flow approach that requires significant management judgments. Impairment occurs when the carrying value of the reporting unit exceeds the discounted present value of the cash flows for that reporting unit. An impairment charge is recorded for the difference between the carrying value and the net present value of estimated future cash flows, which represents the estimated fair value of the asset. The Company uses its judgment in assessing whether assets may have become impaired between annual valuations. Indicators such as unexpected adverse economic factors, unanticipated technological change or competitive activities, loss of key personnel and acts by governments and courts, may signal that an asset has become impaired. For all of its television station acquisitions through June 30, 2005, the Company utilized the residual method to estimate the fair value of the stations FCC licenses. Effective July 1, 2005, the Company adopted Emerging Issues Task Force Topic No. D-108 Use of the Residual Method to Value Acquired Assets Other Than Goodwill ( D-108 ). D-108 requires companies who have applied the residual value method in the valuation of acquired identifiable intangibles for purchase accounting and impairment testing to now use a direct valuation method. The direct valuation method used for FCC licenses requires, among other inputs, the use of published industry data that are based on subjective judgments about future advertising revenues in the markets where the Company owns television stations. This method also involves the use of management judgment in estimating an appropriate discount rate reflecting the risk of a market participant in the U.S. broadcast industry. The resulting fair values for FCC licenses are sensitive to these long-term assumptions and any variations to such assumptions could result in an impairment to existing carrying values in future periods. Income Taxes The Company is subject to income taxes in the U.S. and numerous foreign jurisdictions in which it operates. The Company computes its annual tax rate based on the statutory tax rates and tax planning opportunities available to it in the various jurisdictions in which it earns income. Significant judgment is required in 71 Table of Contents determining the Company annual provision for income taxes and in evaluating its tax positions. The Company establishes reserves for tax-related uncertainties based on evaluations of the probability of whether additional taxes and related interest and penalties will be due. The Company adjusts these reserves based on changing facts and circumstances and it is often difficult to predict the final outcome or the timing of resolution of any particular tax matter. The Company believes that its reserves reflect the probable outcome of known tax matters. The Company records valuation allowances to reduce deferred tax assets to the amount that is more likely than not to be realized. In making this assessment, management analyzes future taxable income, reversing temporary differences and ongoing tax planning strategies. Should a change in circumstances lead to a change in judgment about the realizability of deferred tax assets in future years, the Company would adjust related valuation allowances in the period that the change in circumstances occurs, along with a corresponding increase or charge to income. Employee Costs The Company maintains defined benefit pension plans covering a majority of its employees and retirees. For financial reporting purposes, net periodic pension expense (income) is calculated based upon a number of actuarial assumptions including a discount rate for plan obligations and an expected rate of return on plan assets. The Company considers current market conditions, including changes in investment returns and interest rates, in making these assumptions. In developing the expected long-term rate of return, the Company considered the pension portfolio past average rate of returns, and future return expectations of the various asset classes. The expected long-term rate of return is based on an asset allocation assumption of 61% equities, 36% fixed-income securities and 3% in all other investments. The discount rate reflects the market rate for high-quality fixed-income investments on the Company annual measurement date of June 30 and is subject to change each year. The discount rate assumptions used to account for pension and other postretirement benefit plans reflect the rates at which the benefit obligations could be effectively settled. The U.S. rate was determined based on a cash flow matching technique whereby a hypothetical portfolio of high quality debt securities was constructed that mirrors the specific benefit obligations for each of the Company primary plans where appropriate. The key assumptions used in developing the Company fiscal 2006, 2005, 2004 and 2003 net periodic pension expense (income) for its plans consists of the following: 2006 2005 2004 2003 ($ in millions) Discount rate used to determine net periodic benefit cost 5.1 % 5.7 % 5.6 % 6.3 % Assets: Expected rate of return 7.5 % 7.5 % 7.5 % 7.6 % Expected return $ 122 $ 111 $ 88 $ 76 Actual return $ 186 $ 160 $ 149 $ (20 ) Gain/(Loss) $ 64 $ 49 $ 61 $ (96 ) High quality fixed income interest rates have increased during fiscal 2006. Therefore, the Company will use a weighted average discount rate of 5.9% in calculating the fiscal 2007 net periodic pension expense for its plans. During fiscal 2006, the Company reduced the plan assets allocated to equities and accordingly evaluated the future asset return expectations which the Company believes will be lower than fiscal 2006 expectations. Therefore, the Company will use a weighted average long-term rate of return of 7% for 2007 net periodic pension expense for its plans. The unrecognized net losses on the Company pension plans were $348 million at June 30, 2006, a decrease from $615 million at June 30, 2005. These unrecognized losses are primarily a result of economic conditions and the strengthening of the mortality assumptions. Economic conditions impacting the plan 72 Table of Contents were lower discount rates utilized in the past three fiscal years and the downturn in the equity markets in the earlier part of this decade. The decrease in unrecognized losses from June 30, 2005 to June 30, 2006 is primarily attributable to an increase in the discount rates used to measure plan liabilities. These deferred losses are being systematically recognized in future net periodic pension expense in accordance with SFAS No. 87, Employers Accounting for Pensions ( SFAS No. 87 ). Unrecognized losses in excess of 10% of the greater of the market-related value of plan assets or the plans projected benefit obligation are recognized over the average future service of the plan participants. The Company made contributions of $149 million, $236 million and $214 million to its pension plans in fiscal 2006, 2005 and 2004, respectively. These were primarily voluntary contributions made to improve the funded status of the plans which were impacted by a declining interest rate environment, as well as the poor performance of the equity markets earlier in this decade. Future plan contributions are dependent upon actual plan asset returns and interest rate movements. Assuming that actual plan returns are consistent with the Company expected plan returns in fiscal 2006 and beyond, and that interest rates remain constant, the Company would not be required to make any statutory contributions to its primary U.S. pension plans for the foreseeable future. Changes in net periodic pension expense may occur in the future due to changes in the Company expected rate of return on plan assets and discount rate resulting from economic events. The following table highlights the sensitivity of the Company pension obligations and expense to changes in these assumptions, assuming all other assumptions remain constant: Changes in Assumption Impact on Annual Pension Expense Impact on PBO 0.25 percentage point decrease in discount rate Increase $12 million Increase $86 million 0.25 percentage point increase in discount rate Decrease $12 million Decrease $86 million 0.25 percentage point decrease in expected rate of return on assets Increase $4 million 0.25 percentage point increase in expected rate of return on assets Decrease $4 million SFAS No. 87 requires recognition of an additional minimum pension liability if the fair value of plan assets is less than the accumulated benefit obligation at the end of the plan year. In fiscal 2006, the Company recorded a non-cash adjustment to equity through accumulated other comprehensive income of approximately $286 million which reduced the additional minimum pension liability to approximately $122 million. In fiscal 2005, the Company recorded a non-cash adjustment to equity through accumulated other comprehensive income of approximately $106 million which increased the additional minimum pension liability to approximately $408 million. The fiscal 2006 decrease was due to the current year higher discount rate and asset gains. Equity market returns and interest rates significantly impact the funded status of the Company pension plans. Based on future plan asset performance and interest rates, additional adjustments to equity may be required. Recent Accounting Pronouncements In May 2005, the Financial Accounting Standards Board ( FASB ) issued SFAS No. 154, Accounting Changes and Error Corrections a replacement of APB Opinion No. 20 and FASB Statement No. 3 ( SFAS No. 154 ). This standard establishes, unless impracticable, retrospective application as the required method for reporting a change in accounting principle in the absence of explicit transition requirements specific to the newly adopted accounting principle. SFAS No. 154 will become effective for the Company for accounting changes and corrections of errors beginning in fiscal 2007. SFAS No. 154 may have a significant effect on the Company consolidated financial statements to the extent that the Company changes its accounting principles in the future. 73 Table of Contents In November 2005, the FASB issued FASB Staff Position ( FSP ) FAS 115-1 and FAS 124-1, The Meaning of Other-Than-Temporary Impairment and Its Application to Certain Investments, ( FSP 115-1 and 124-1 ) which addresses the determination as to when an investment is considered impaired, whether that impairment is other-than-temporary and the measurement of an impairment loss. FSP 115-1 and 124-1 also includes accounting considerations subsequent to the recognition of an other-than-temporary impairment and requires certain disclosures about unrealized losses that have not been recognized as other-than-temporary impairments. The guidance in FSP 115-1 and 124-1 amends FASB Statement No. 115, Accounting for Certain Investments in Debt and Equity Securities, and Accounting Principles Board ( APB ) Opinion No. 18, The Equity Method of Accounting for Investments in Common Stock. FSP 115-1 and 124-1 was effective for reporting periods beginning after December 15, 2005. The adoption of FSP 115-1 and 124-1 did not have a material impact on the Companies consolidated financial statements. In February 2006, the FASB issued SFAS No. 155, Accounting for Certain Hybrid Instruments ( SFAS No. 155 ). SFAS No. 155 amends SFAS No. 133 and SFAS No. 140, Accounting for Transfers and Servicing of Financial Assets and Extinguishments of Liabilities. SFAS No. 155, among other things: permits the fair value remeasurement of any hybrid financial instrument that contains an embedded derivative that otherwise would require bifurcation; clarifies which interest-only strips and principal-only strips are not subject to the requirements of SFAS No. 133; and establishes a requirement to evaluate interests in securitized financial assets to identify interests that are freestanding derivatives or that are hybrid financial instruments that contain an embedded derivative requiring bifurcation. SFAS No. 155 is effective for all financial instruments acquired or issued in fiscal years beginning after September 15, 2006. SFAS No. 155 is not expected to have a material impact on the Company consolidated financial statements. In June 2006, the FASB issued FASB Interpretation No. 48, Accounting for Uncertainty in Income Taxes, an Interpretation of FASB Statement No. 109 ( FIN 48 ). FIN 48 clarifies the accounting for uncertainty in income taxes recognized in accordance with SFAS No. 109, Accounting for Income Taxes and prescribes a recognition threshold and measurement attribute for the financial statement recognition and measurement of a tax position taken or expected to be taken in a tax return. FIN 48 also provides guidance on derecognition, classification, interest and penalties, accounting in interim periods, disclosure and transition. FIN 48 will become effective for the Company beginning in fiscal 2008. The Company is currently evaluating what effect the adoption of FIN 48 will have on the Company future results of operations and financial condition. 74 Table of Contents
