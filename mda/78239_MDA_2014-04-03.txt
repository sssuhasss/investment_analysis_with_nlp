Item 7. Management Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations OVERVIEW The following discussion and analysis is intended to help you understand us, our operations and our financial performance. It should be read in conjunction with our consolidated financial statements and the accompanying notes, which are included elsewhere in this report. We are one of the largest branded apparel companies in the world, with a heritage dating back over 130 years. Our brand portfolio consists of nationally and internationally recognized brand names, including Calvin Klein, Tommy Hilfiger, Van Heusen, IZOD, ARROW, Speedo (licensed for North America in perpetuity from Speedo International, Ltd.), Warner and Olga . In addition, through the end of the third quarter of 2013, we owned, and operated businesses under, the G.H. Bass & Co . and Bass trademarks. We also license brands from third parties primarily for use on dress shirts and neckwear offered in the United States and Canada. 30 We acquired Warnaco on February 13, 2013, and, with it, acquired the global Calvin Klein jeanswear and underwear businesses and the Core Intimates (Warner and Olga) and Speedo businesses, which operate primarily in North America. Prior to the acquisition, Warnaco was our largest Calvin Klein licensee, as their royalty and administrative fee payments to us accounted for approximately 37% of our Calvin Klein royalty, advertising and other revenue in 2012. Our total consideration for the acquisition was $3.137 billion, consisting of $2.180 billion paid in cash, the issuance of approximately 8 million shares of our common stock (valued at $926 million), the issuance of stock awards valued at $40 million to replace outstanding stock awards made by Warnaco to its employees and the elimination of a $9 million pre-acquisition liability to Warnaco. We funded the cash portion and related costs of the acquisition, repaid all outstanding borrowings under our previously outstanding senior secured credit facilities and repaid all of Warnaco previously outstanding long-term debt with the net proceeds of (i) an offering during the fourth quarter of 2012 of $700 million of 4 1/2% senior notes due 2022; and (ii) $3.075 billion of term loans borrowed during the first quarter of 2013 under new senior secured credit facilities. These items are more fully described in the section entitled Liquidity and Capital Resources below. Our revenue reached a record $8.186 billion in 2013, approximately 45% of which was generated internationally. Our global designer lifestyle brands, Tommy Hilfiger and Calvin Klein , together generated approximately 75% of this revenue. Our business strategy is to manage and market a portfolio of nationally and internationally recognized apparel and lifestyle brands at multiple price points and across multiple channels of distribution. We believe this approach reduces our reliance on any one demographic group, merchandise preference, distribution channel or geographic region. Our acquisition of Warnaco is consistent with this strategy, as it gave us direct global control of the brand image and commercial operations for Calvin Klein two largest apparel categories jeanswear and underwear. With these categories under our ownership, our teams have taken steps to strengthen management, improve operations, unify our brand messaging, and coordinate and improve design, merchandising, retail distribution and marketing functions on a regional and global basis. We believe that these steps, which we will build upon in 2014, will strengthen Calvin Klein s image, positioning and execution across all markets to drive sustainable growth. The Warnaco acquisition also provides a broader global platform for both the Calvin Klein and Tommy Hilfiger businesses and has enabled us to continue to transform from a primarily North American multi-brand business with strong European Tommy Hilfiger operations, to a more diversified, global organization. We intend to take advantage of our and Warnaco complementary geographic operations; Warnaco operations in Asia and Brazil should enhance our opportunities in those high-growth regions, and we will have the opportunity to leverage our expertise and infrastructure in North America and Europe to enhance the growth and profitability of the Calvin Klein Jeans and Calvin Klein Underwear businesses in those regions. The acquisition also added the Speedo , Warner and Olga brands to our Heritage Brands portfolio. Like our other Heritage Brands businesses, these businesses are replenishment-based and generally provide consistent profitability, healthy margins and strong cash flows. With a diversified brand portfolio and strong operations in every major consumer market around the world, we believe the acquisition made our business better balanced across geographies, channels of distribution, product categories and price points, and expanded our opportunity to realize revenue growth and enhanced profitability. We remain on track to achieve significant synergies created through the acquisition, principally with respect to certain corporate functions and duplicative brand management functions in North America and Europe. Additionally, in order to focus on our core competencies in apparel and continue to grow the Calvin Klein and Tommy Hilfiger brands globally, we sold substantially all of the assets of our Bass division on November 4, 2013. The sale enables us to further invest in our more profitable apparel businesses, while also reducing sales and earnings volatility. RESULTS OF OPERATIONS Operations Overview We generate net sales from (i) the wholesale distribution to retailers, franchisees, licensees and distributors of men dress shirts, neckwear and underwear, men and women jeanswear, sportswear, intimate apparel, swim products, footwear, accessories and related products under owned and licensed trademarks; and (ii) the sale through approximately 1,900 company-operated free-standing retail store locations worldwide under our Calvin Klein , Tommy Hilfiger , Van Heusen and IZOD trademarks, and approximately 900 company-operated concessions/shop-in-shops worldwide under our Calvin Klein and Tommy Hilfiger trademarks, of apparel, footwear, accessories and other products. We also operated G.H. Bass & Co . stores through the end of the third quarter of 2013, at which time we sold substantially all of the assets of our Bass business. We generate royalty, advertising and other revenue from fees for licensing the use of our trademarks. A substantial portion of our Calvin Klein licensing revenue was generated from Warnaco prior to the acquisition and, therefore, our royalty, advertising and other revenue decreased significantly in 2013 as compared to prior periods. In addition, the loss of such licensing revenue had a negative impact on our gross profit on total revenue, as licensing revenue carries no cost of goods sold. 31 We recorded pre-tax charges of $46 million during 2012 associated with the Warnaco acquisition. During 2013, we recorded pre-tax charges of $511 million in connection with the acquisition, integration, restructuring, and debt modification and extinguishment. This amount included non-cash charges of approximately $215 million, principally related to short-lived valuation adjustments and amortization and debt modification and extinguishment costs. We expect to incur additional costs and charges of approximately $100 million related to the integration and related restructuring in 2014. Our future results of operations will continue to be significantly impacted by this acquisition, particularly through the operations of the Calvin Klein business and through the changes in our capital structure that were necessary to effect the acquisition, as more fully discussed below. The acquisition of Warnaco has significantly impacted the way we manage and analyze our operating results. As such, beginning with the first quarter of 2013, our reportable segments have been Calvin Klein North America, Calvin Klein International, Tommy Hilfiger North America, Tommy Hilfiger International, Heritage Brands Wholesale and Heritage Brands Retail. Please refer to Note 19, Segment Data, in the Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements included in Item 8 of this report for a further discussion. On November 4, 2013, we sold substantially all of the assets of our Bass business and recorded a net pre-tax loss of $20 million during 2013 in connection with the sale. Please see the section entitled Sale of Bass within Liquidity and Capital Resources below for a further discussion. We acquired Tommy Hilfiger in the second quarter of 2010. We recorded a gain of $24 million in 2013 due to the amendment of an unfavorable contract. At the time of the Tommy Hilfiger acquisition in 2010, a liability was recorded for such unfavorable contract. The amendment executed in 2013 adjusted the contract terms thereby reducing the amount by which the contract was unfavorable and resulted in a reduction of the liability in the amount of $24 million. We incurred pre-tax charges of $21 million and $70 million during 2012 and 2011, respectively, in connection with the integration and the related restructuring, including product exit charges. We reacquired during the third quarter of 2011 the rights in India to the Tommy Hilfiger trademarks that had been subject to a perpetual license. We paid $25 million as consideration for this transaction and are required to make annual contingent purchase price payments under certain circumstances. In connection with that transaction, we were required to record an expense of $21 million in 2011 due to the settlement of an unfavorable contract as a result of a pre-existing relationship with the licensee, as the license provided favorable terms to the licensee. Please see the section entitled Liquidity and Capital Resources below for a further discussion. We announced in 2011 that we would be exiting in 2012 our licensed Timberland men wholesale sportswear and our Izod women wholesale sportswear businesses. We incurred pre-tax charges of $8 million during 2011 in connection with these two initiatives. We amended and restated our senior secured credit facility in the first quarter of 2011. We recorded debt modification costs of $16 million in connection with this transaction. Please see the section entitled Liquidity and Capital Resources below for a further discussion. Our calculations of the comparable store sales percentages throughout this discussion are based on comparable weeks and, therefore, exclude an extra week in 2012, as our 2012 fiscal year included 53 weeks of operations. 32 The following table summarizes our income statements in 2013, 2012 and 2011: 2013 2012 2011 (dollars in millions) Net sales $ 7,806 $ 5,541 $ 5,410 Royalty revenue 291 370 356 Advertising and other revenue 90 132 125 Total revenue 8,186 6,043 5,891 Gross profit 4,219 3,249 3,056 % of total revenue 51.5 % 53.8 % 51.9 % Selling, general and administrative expenses 3,673 2,594 2,550 % of total revenue 44.9 % 42.9 % 43.3 % Debt modification and extinguishment costs 40 16 Equity in income of unconsolidated affiliates, net 8 5 1 Income before interest and taxes 513 660 491 Interest expense 192 119 129 Interest income 8 1 1 Income before taxes 329 543 363 Income tax expense 185 109 87 Net income 143 434 276 Less: Net loss attributable to redeemable non-controlling interest 0 Net income attributable to PVH Corp. $ 144 $ 434 $ 276 Total Revenue Net Sales Our net sales were $7.806 billion in 2013, $5.541 billion in 2012 and $5.410 billion in 2011. The net sales increase of $2.265 billion in 2013 as compared to 2012 was due principally to the effect of the following items: An increase of $1.744 billion in net sales in our Calvin Klein North America and Calvin Klein International segments. The newly acquired Calvin Klein businesses contributed $1.635 billion of this increase. Also driving the increase was strong performance in the pre-acquisition North America businesses due to an 8% increase in the wholesale business combined with an increase in the retail business, driven by comparable store sales growth of 3% and square footage expansion. With respect to the newly acquired businesses, the North America underwear business performed well and exceeded plan, while the North America jeans business was weak as we focused on transitioning to elevated product for Fall 2014 and completed clearing excess inventory. Comparable store sales within the Calvin Klein International segment (which relate to newly acquired businesses) decreased 1%. The Calvin Klein businesses in Brazil and Asia performed well and exceeded expectations. Within Asia, the China business exhibited solid growth and the Korea business, although down compared to the prior year, showed improving trends during the year. The Calvin Klein business in Europe underperformed and was under pressure primarily due to our initiative to restructure the sales distribution mix in this region and the business concentration in Southern Europe, in particular Italy, where there is a weak macroeconomic environment. In addition, net sales in the Calvin Klein International segment in 2013 include a reduction of $30 million due to sales returns for certain Warnaco Asia wholesale customers in connection with an initiative to reduce excess inventory levels. An increase of $209 million in net sales attributable to growth in our Tommy Hilfiger North America and Tommy Hilfiger International segments. Within the Tommy Hilfiger North America segment, net sales increased 8%, principally driven by 4% retail comparable store sales growth, retail square footage expansion and double-digit growth in the wholesale business. Net sales in the Tommy Hilfiger International segment increased 6%. Growth in Europe was driven by a 6% European retail comparable store sales increase, retail square footage expansion and a 9% increase in the European wholesale business and also included the positive impact of foreign currency translation due to a stronger Euro as compared with the prior year period. These increases were partially offset by a revenue decline in Japan, where we continue our efforts to reposition the brand. The revenue in Japan was also negatively impacted by foreign currency translation due to a weaker Yen as compared with the prior year. 33 An increase of $313 million in net sales in our Heritage Brands Wholesale and Heritage Brands Retail segments. The newly acquired Speedo, Warner and Olga businesses contributed $450 million of net sales in our Heritage Brands Wholesale segment and revenue in our pre-acquisition ongoing Heritage Brands wholesale businesses increased 2%. These revenue increases were partially offset by (i) the loss of $75 million of revenue generated in the fourth quarter of 2012 related to the exited Bass business; (ii) the loss of sales related to the exited Izod women and Timberland wholesale sportswear businesses, which totaled $42 million in 2012; and (iii) a comparable store sales decline of 7% in the retail business due, in large part, to weak performance at Bass during the first three quarters of 2013. The 2012 net sales increase of $131 million as compared to 2011 included a negative impact of approximately $210 million, or 4%, of which approximately $110 million was due to foreign currency translation and approximately $100 million was attributable to the exit from the Izod women and Timberland wholesale sportswear businesses. The overall increase in 2012 as compared to 2011 was due principally to the effect of the following items: An increase of $154 million in net sales attributable to growth in our Tommy Hilfiger North America and Tommy Hilfiger International segments. Within the Tommy Hilfiger North America segment, net sales increased 10%, principally driven by retail comparable store sales growth of 10%. Net sales in the Tommy Hilfiger International segment increased 2%, including a negative impact of approximately $110 million, or 6%, related to foreign currency translation. European retail comparable store sales grew 11% and the European wholesale business exhibited strong growth, but these increases were partially offset by weakness in Japan. An increase of $70 million in net sales attributable to our Calvin Klein North America segment, driven principally by (i) a 12% increase in the North America Calvin Klein retail business, which was due to new store openings, store expansions and a 5% increase in comparable store sales; and (ii) a 16% increase in the North America wholesale business. A $100 million reduction in net sales attributable to our Heritage Brands Wholesale and Heritage Brands Retail segments. Comparable store sales in the Heritage Brands Retail segment were relatively flat as compared to 2011, while sales in the Heritage Brands Wholesale segment decreased 10%, principally related to the exited sportswear businesses. Royalty, Advertising and Other Revenue Royalty, advertising and other revenue in 2013 decreased to $380 million from $502 million in 2012, as strong performance in women apparel, handbags and accessories, as well as men and women outerwear, was more than offset by the absence in 2013 of Warnaco royalty and advertising revenue subsequent to the Warnaco acquisition, and the expiration of a long-term contractual agreement related to Calvin Klein royalties in the North America women sportswear business, which together totaled $146 million. Excluding this contractual agreement and the loss of Warnaco royalty and advertising revenue, Calvin Klein royalty, advertising and other revenue increased 8%. Tommy Hilfiger royalty, advertising and other revenue increased $7 million due to growth across most licensed product categories. Royalty, advertising and other revenue was $502 million in 2012 as compared to $481 million in 2011. Of the $22 million increase, $12 million was attributable to our Tommy Hilfiger business, due principally to strong performance in footwear in North America, watches and eyewear globally, and other product categories in Asia and Latin America. Within the Calvin Klein business, global licensee royalty revenue increased 2%, including a negative impact of 1% related to foreign currency translation. Continued global growth in women apparel, footwear and handbags was partially offset by a decline in royalty revenue related to a reduction in the European Calvin Klein bridge and accessories business attributable, in part, to our decision to terminate the previous licenses and operate the business directly, and weakness in jeans and women underwear in Europe and the United States. We currently expect that our 2014 revenue will increase to approximately $8.5 billion, a 3% increase, as compared to 2013, including the negative impact of $176 million, or 2%, attributable to the 2013 exit from the Bass business. Aggregate revenue for our Calvin Klein North America and Calvin Klein International segments in 2014 is projected to increase 5% from 2013, which included $30 million of sales returns recorded for certain Warnaco Asia wholesale customers in connection with an initiative to reduce excess inventory levels. Aggregate revenue for our Tommy Hilfiger North America and Tommy Hilfiger International segments in 2014 is expected to increase 7%. Aggregate revenue for our Heritage Brands Wholesale and Heritage Brands Retail segments is expected to decrease 5% as compared to 2013, including a negative impact of approximately 9% due to the absence of revenue from the Bass business we sold. 34 Gross Profit on Total Revenue Gross profit on total revenue is calculated as total revenue less cost of goods sold. Included as cost of goods sold are costs associated with the production and procurement of product, including inbound freight costs, purchasing and receiving costs, inspection costs and other product procurement related charges. All of our royalty, advertising and other revenue is included in gross profit because there is no cost of goods sold associated with such revenue. As a result, our gross profit may not be comparable to that of other entities. The following table shows our revenue mix between net sales and royalty, advertising and other revenue, as well as our gross profit as a percentage of total revenue for 2013, 2012 and 2011: 2013 2012 2011 Components of revenue: Net sales 95.4 % 91.7 % 91.8 % Royalty, advertising and other revenue 4.6 % 8.3 % 8.2 % Total 100.0 % 100.0 % 100.0 % Gross profit as a % of total revenue 51.5 % 53.8 % 51.9 % Gross profit on total revenue in 2013 was $4.219 billion, or 51.5% of total revenue, compared to $3.249 billion, or 53.8% of total revenue, in 2012. Gross profit as a percentage of revenue decreased 230 basis points in 2013 as compared with 2012, due primarily to (i) short-lived non-cash valuation adjustments recorded in connection with the Warnaco acquisition, which resulted in a decrease of approximately 60 basis points; (ii) returns recorded in connection with an initiative to reduce excess inventory levels, which resulted in a decrease of approximately 20 basis points; (iii) a significant decrease in our royalty, advertising and other revenue, which does not carry a cost of sales and has a gross profit percentage of 100%, for Calvin Klein as a result of the Warnaco acquisition, which is now replaced by the directly operated Calvin Klein Jeans and Calvin Klein Underwear businesses, which do carry a cost of sales and have a large North American wholesale component (that generally operates at lower gross margins than our other businesses); (iv) the newly acquired Speedo, Warner and Olga businesses, which principally operate in North America and generate lower gross margins than our other businesses; and (v) a decrease in the Tommy Hilfiger International segment due to underperformance in Japan. Partially offsetting these decreases was an increase related to the pre-acquisition Calvin Klein North America businesses resulting principally from higher average unit retail selling prices. Gross profit on total revenue in 2012 was $3.249 billion, or 53.8% of total revenue, compared to $3.056 billion, or 51.9% of total revenue, in 2011. Gross profit as a percentage of revenue increased 190 basis points in 2012 as compared with 2011, due primarily to our mix of business, as we experienced faster growth in our higher-margin Tommy Hilfiger and Calvin Klein businesses while exiting the lower-margin Izod women and Timberland wholesale sportswear businesses. In addition, our Tommy Hilfiger business experienced an increase in gross profit as a percentage of revenue resulting from higher average unit retail selling prices globally. We currently expect that the gross profit percentage on total revenue in 2014 will increase as compared with 2013, due principally to the absence in 2014 of short-lived non-cash valuation adjustments recorded in connection with the Warnaco acquisition and returns we recorded in connection with an initiative to reduce excess inventory levels. In addition, we expect growth in our higher-margin Tommy Hilfiger and Calvin Klein businesses to outpace growth in our lower-margin Heritage Brands businesses. Selling, General and Administrative ( SG&A ) Expenses Our SG&A expenses were as follows: 2013 2012 2011 (dollars in millions) SG&A expenses $ 3,673 $ 2,594 $ 2,550 % of total revenue 44.9 % 42.9 % 43.3 % 35 SG&A expenses in 2013 were $3.673 billion, or 44.9% of total revenue, as compared to $2.594 billion, or 42.9% of total revenue in 2012. The 200 basis point increase in SG&A expenses as a percentage of total revenue was due principally to the net impact of (i) a net 400 basis point increase due to an increase over the prior year in acquisition, integration and restructuring costs incurred in connection with the Warnaco acquisition, of which 140 basis points were non-cash charges, principally related to short-lived valuation adjustments and amortization; and (ii) a 20 basis point increase due to the loss recorded in connection with the sale of the Bass business partially offset by (i) a 110 basis point decrease due to lower retirement plan expense resulting from actuarial gains in 2013, as compared to actuarial losses in 2012; (ii) a 30 basis point decrease in SG&A related to income recorded due to the amendment of an unfavorable contract, which resulted in the reduction of a liability recorded at the time of the Tommy Hilfiger acquisition; (iii) a 30 basis point decrease in SG&A due to the absence in 2013 of integration and restructuring costs related to the Tommy Hilfiger acquisition; and (iv) a decrease due to the addition of Warnaco businesses, most of which are lower-expense wholesale businesses. SG&A expenses in 2012 were $2.594 billion, or 42.9% of total revenue, as compared to $2.550 billion, or 43.3% of total revenue in 2011. The 40 basis point decrease in SG&A expenses as a percentage of total revenue was due primarily to the effect of (i) an 80 basis point decrease due to lower pension expense resulting from smaller actuarial losses; and (ii) a net 50 basis point decrease due to a reduction in acquisition, integration and restructuring costs incurred, primarily related to the Tommy Hilfiger acquisition; partially offset by (iii) a 90 basis point increase due principally to faster growth in the higher-expense Tommy Hilfiger and Calvin Klein businesses. We currently expect that our SG&A expenses as a percentage of total revenue in 2014 will decrease from 2013, due principally to the lower costs expected to be incurred in 2014 in connection with the integration and related restructuring of Warnaco as compared to 2013. Our SG&A expenses may also be significantly impacted by the amount of expense recorded for our pension plans. Pension expense recorded throughout the year is calculated using actuarial valuations that incorporate assumptions and estimates about financial market, economic and demographic conditions. Differences between estimated and actual results give rise to gains and losses that are recorded immediately in earnings, generally in the fourth quarter of the year, which can create volatility in our operating results. Debt Modification and Extinguishment Costs We incurred costs totaling $40 million in 2013 related to the modification and extinguishment of our previously outstanding term loans and the replacement of such term loans with new senior secured credit facilities entered into in 2013 in connection with the Warnaco acquisition. Please refer to the section entitled Liquidity and Capital Resources below for a discussion of this transaction. We incurred costs totaling $16 million during 2011 in connection with the amendment and restatement of our senior secured credit facility entered into in 2010. Please refer to the section entitled Liquidity and Capital Resources below for a discussion of this transaction. We incurred approximately $90 million of costs in March 2014 related to the refinancing of our term loans and the redemption of our 7 3/8% senior notes due 2020, of which approximately $10 million was non-cash. Please refer to the section entitled Liquidity and Capital Resources below for a discussion of these transactions. Equity in Income of Unconsolidated Affiliates, Net The equity in income of unconsolidated affiliates, net during 2013 was $8 million as compared to $5 million during 2012 and $1 million during 2011. These amounts relate to our share of income from our joint ventures for the Tommy Hilfiger brand in China and India, both of which began operations under our partnership in the third quarter of 2011, and in Brazil, which began operations in the fourth quarter of 2012. Our investments in these joint ventures are being accounted for under the equity method of accounting. Please refer to the section entitled Investments in Unconsolidated Affiliates (Australia, Brazil, China and India Joint Ventures) within Liquidity and Capital Resources below for a further discussion of our investments in these joint ventures. Interest Expense and Interest Income Interest expense increased to $192 million in 2013 from $119 million in 2012 due principally to increased debt balances in 2013 incurred to finance the Warnaco acquisition. Please refer to the section entitled Financing Arrangements within Liquidity and Capital Resources below for a further discussion. Interest income increased to $8 million in 2013 from $1 million in 2012, due principally to an increase in our average cash position during 2013. 36 Interest expense decreased to $119 million in 2012 from $129 million in 2011, principally as a result of payments we made on our term loans during 2012 and 2011, partially offset by interest expense incurred on our $700 million of 4 1/2% senior notes due 2022, which were issued during the fourth quarter of 2012 to fund a portion of the consideration for the Warnaco acquisition. Please refer to the section entitled Financing Arrangements within Liquidity and Capital Resources below for a further discussion. Interest income of $1 million in 2012 was relatively flat to 2011. Net interest expense for 2014 is currently expected to decrease to approximately $145 million from $185 million in 2013, principally as a result of anticipated debt payments of approximately $400 million in 2014, combined with the effect of debt payments made during 2013 and the March 2014 refinancing of our term loans and redemption of our 7 3/8% senior notes due 2020, as more fully discussed in the section entitled Financing Arrangements within Liquidity and Capital Resources below. Income Taxes Income tax expense was as follows: 2013 2012 2011 (dollars in millions) Income tax expense $ 185 $ 109 $ 87 Income tax expense as a % of pre-tax income 56.4 % 20.1 % 24.1 % Since the acquisition of Tommy Hilfiger in 2010, our effective tax rate has generally been lower than the United States statutory rate, due principally to the benefit of overall lower tax rates in international jurisdictions where we file tax returns. While this was not the case in 2013 as explained below, we generally expect this to continue. The effective tax rate for 2013 was 56.4% compared with 20.1% in 2012. The effective tax rate for 2013 increased as compared to 2012 due principally to a significant increase to our estimate for uncertain tax positions principally due to an increase to our previously established liability for an uncertain tax position related to European and United States transfer pricing arrangements. Also contributing to the increased rate in 2013 was an expense related to valuation allowances recorded on deferred tax assets from our business in Japan, as well as certain domestic state and local deferred tax assets. Partially offsetting these increases was the impact of Warnaco integration and restructuring expenses in 2013, the majority of which are being incurred in the United States, which lowers our domestic taxable income in relation to taxable income in lower tax international jurisdictions. The effective tax rate for 2012 was 20.1% compared with 24.1% in 2011. The 2012 effective tax rate was lower than 2011 due to certain foreign earnings in 2011 being taxed in the United States, as well as additional tax synergies resulting from the Tommy Hilfiger acquisition, partially offset by non-deductible acquisition expenses incurred in 2012 in connection with the Warnaco acquisition. We currently anticipate that our 2014 effective tax rate will be substantially less than the 2013 effective tax rate, as we currently do not expect the impact we experienced from increasing our estimate for uncertain tax positions to recur. Such reduction is expected to be partially offset by reduced Warnaco integration and restructuring expenses, which would increase the proportion of our pre-tax earnings subject to United States tax. Our tax rate is affected by many factors, including the mix of international and domestic pre-tax earnings, discrete events arising from specific transactions, and audits by tax authorities or the receipt of new information, any of which can cause us to change our estimate for uncertain tax positions. Redeemable Non-Controlling Interest The net loss attributable to the redeemable non-controlling interest in CK India owned by our minority partners was $55,000 for 2013. Please refer to Note 6, Redeemable Non-Controlling Interest, in the Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements included in Item 8 of this report for a further discussion. 37 LIQUIDITY AND CAPITAL RESOURCES Cash Flow Summary Cash at February 2, 2014 was $593 million, which included the impact of $2.993 billion of net proceeds from the senior secured credit facilities entered into in 2013 at the time of the Warnaco acquisition, offset by $2.180 billion of cash paid as consideration for the acquisition and $1.097 billion of debt payments made to repay all outstanding borrowings under our previously outstanding senior secured credit facilities and all of Warnaco previously outstanding long-term debt. In addition, cash at February 2, 2014 included the impact of $500 million of payments on our senior secured credit facilities during the year ended February 2, 2014. Cash at February 2, 2014 excluded a restricted cash balance of $10 million, which was placed into an escrow account prior to year end to contribute funding to our joint venture in Australia in the first quarter of 2014. See the section entitled Investments in Unconsolidated Affiliates (Australia, Brazil, China and India Joint Ventures) below for a further discussion. Cash at February 3, 2013 was $892 million, which included the proceeds from the $700 million senior notes offering undertaken in connection with the Warnaco acquisition. Cash flow in 2014 will be impacted by various factors in addition to those noted below in this Liquidity and Capital Resources section, including the amount of debt repayments we make in 2014. As of February 2, 2014 , approximately $467 million of cash and cash equivalents was held by international subsidiaries whose undistributed earnings are considered permanently reinvested. Our intent is to reinvest these funds in international operations. If management decides at a later date to repatriate these funds to the United States, we would be required to provide taxes on these amounts based on applicable United States tax rates, net of foreign taxes already paid. Operations Cash provided by operating activities was $412 million in 2013, as compared with $570 million in 2012. The decrease in cash provided by operating activities as compared to the prior year was primarily driven by the payment of expenses related to the Warnaco acquisition, integration and the related restructuring. Additionally, cash provided by operating activities in 2013 includes a $30 million contribution to fund the defined benefit qualified pension plan we acquired as part of the Warnaco acquisition and an additional $30 million contribution to fund our pre-existing pension plans. The factors that affect our cash provided by operating activities have been significantly impacted by the Warnaco acquisition. In the future, we expect that our cash provided by operating activities will generally increase as a result of the acquisition. This increase will generally be used to repay debt, as well as to fund additional capital spending to expand and invest in our businesses, principally for the Calvin Klein and Tommy Hilfiger businesses. In addition, the changes in the amount of cash provided and used related to our working capital will be more pronounced as a result of the Warnaco acquisition. Acquisition of Warnaco We completed our acquisition of Warnaco on February 13, 2013. We paid $2.180 billion in cash and issued approximately 8 million shares of our common stock, valued at $926 million, as consideration for the acquisition. In addition, we issued replacement stock awards related to employee stock-based compensation grants valued at $40 million and eliminated a $9 million pre-acquisition liability to Warnaco, both of which for accounting purposes are included in the total consideration of approximately $3.137 billion. The value of the replacement stock awards was determined by multiplying the estimated fair value of the Warnaco awards outstanding at the time of the acquisition, reduced by an estimated value of awards to be forfeited, by the proportionate amount of the vesting period that had lapsed as of the acquisition date. We funded the cash portion and related costs of the acquisition, repaid all outstanding borrowings under our previously outstanding senior secured credit facilities and repaid all of Warnaco previously outstanding long-term debt with the net proceeds of (i) an offering during the fourth quarter of 2012 of $700 million of 4 1/2% senior notes due 2022; and (ii) $3.075 billion of term loans borrowed during the first quarter of 2013 under new senior secured credit facilities. See the discussion in the sections entitled 4 1/2% Senior Notes Due 2022 and 2013 Senior Secured Credit Facilities below for further detail on these activities. Sale of Chaps Sportswear Assets Contemporaneously with our acquisition of Warnaco, Ralph Lauren Corporation reacquired the Chaps license. The Chaps sportswear business was previously operated by Warnaco under such license. In connection with this transaction, we sold all of the assets of the Chaps sportswear business, which consisted principally of inventory, to Ralph Lauren Corporation for gross proceeds of $18 million. 38 Sale of Bass On November 4, 2013, we completed the sale of substantially all of the assets of our Bass business for gross proceeds of $49 million. We recorded a loss of $16 million, which represents the excess of the carrying value of the assets over the proceeds received, plus costs to sell. A small number of our Bass stores were excluded from the sale and were deemed to be impaired. As such, we recorded a loss of $1 million during 2013 related to the impaired stores. In addition, we recorded a gain during 2013 of $3 million from writing off certain liabilities as a result of the transaction. We also recognized costs during 2013 related to severance and termination benefits for certain Bass employees, which totaled $2 million. In connection with the sale, we also guaranteed lease payments for substantially all Bass retail stores included in the sale pursuant to the terms of noncancelable leases expiring on various dates through 2022. We recorded an expense of $4 million during 2013 representing the estimated fair value of these guarantee obligations at the time of the sale. Investments in Unconsolidated Affiliates (Australia, Brazil, China and India Joint Ventures) In 2013, we formed a joint venture, PVH Brands Australia Pty. Limited ( PVH Australia ), in Australia, in which we own a 50% economic interest. The joint venture licenses from one of our subsidiaries the rights to distribute and sell certain Calvin Klein brand products in Australia, New Zealand and other island nations in the South Pacific. As part of the joint venture agreement, we contributed to the joint venture our subsidiaries that were operating the Calvin Klein jeans businesses in Australia and New Zealand. Upon completion of this contribution, which took place on the first day of fiscal year 2014, we deconsolidated these subsidiaries. We made a payment of $708,000 to PVH Australia during 2013 to contribute our 50% share of funding. Subsequent to year-end, we made an additional payment of $10 million to PVH Australia to contribute our 50% share of the joint venture funding. Such amount was placed into an escrow account prior to year end and is classified as restricted cash, which is included in other current assets in our Consolidated Balance Sheets as of February 2, 2014. In 2012, we formed a joint venture, Tommy Hilfiger do Brasil S.A., in Brazil, in which we own a 40% economic interest. The joint venture holds an exclusive license for the Tommy Hilfiger brand in Brazil that became effective on January 4, 2013. We made payments totaling $3 million and $6 million to Tommy Hilfiger do Brasil S.A. during 2013 and 2012, respectively, to contribute our 40% share of the joint venture funding. In 2010, we formed a joint venture, TH Asia Ltd., in China in which we own a 45% economic interest. The joint venture assumed direct control of the Tommy Hilfiger wholesale and retail distribution business in China from the prior licensee in 2011. We made funding payments with respect to our 45% interest totaling $17 million during 2011. In 2011, we completed a $30 million acquisition of a 50% economic interest in a company that has since been renamed Tommy Hilfiger Arvind Fashion Private Limited ( TH India ). TH India is the direct licensee of the Tommy Hilfiger trademarks in India for all categories (other than fragrance), operates a wholesale apparel, footwear and handbags business in connection with its license, and sublicenses the trademarks for certain other product categories. We made payments totaling $2 million to TH India in each of 2012 and 2011, to contribute our 50% share of the joint venture funding. Acquisition of Russia Franchisee In 2013, we acquired three Tommy Hilfiger stores in Russia from a former Tommy Hilfiger franchisee. We paid $6 million as consideration for this transaction. Two additional stores are expected to be acquired in 2014 for approximately $5 million. Acquisition of Netherlands Franchisee In 2012, we acquired from a former Tommy Hilfiger franchisee in the Netherlands 100% of the share capital of ten affiliated companies, which operate 13 Tommy Hilfiger stores in the Netherlands. We paid $13 million as consideration for this transaction. 39 Reacquisition of Tommy Hilfiger Tailored Apparel License We entered into agreements during 2011 to reacquire from a licensee, prior to the expiration of the license, the rights to distribute Tommy Hilfiger brand tailored apparel in Europe and acquire an outlet store from the licensee. The transfer of the rights and store ownership became effective December 31, 2012. Under these agreements, we made a payment of $10 million to the licensee during 2011 and made an additional payment of $25 million to the licensee during 2012. Capital Expenditures Our capital expenditures in 2013 were $237 million compared to $211 million in 2012. This increase was due principally to investments in the operations we acquired with Warnaco and in combining Warnaco infrastructure with ours. We currently expect capital expenditures in 2014 to be approximately $300 million, which includes a shift into 2014 of expenditures originally expected to occur in 2013. Capital expenditures in 2014 will primarily include continued investments in operations and the infrastructure of the combined company, including information systems, logistics and facilities. Tommy Hilfiger India Perpetual License Rights Reacquisition and Contingent Purchase Price Payments We reacquired in 2011 the rights in India to the Tommy Hilfiger trademarks that had been subject to a perpetual license previously granted to GVM for $25 million. We are required to make annual contingent purchase price payments into 2016 (or, under certain circumstances, into 2017) based on a percentage of annual sales in excess of an agreed upon threshold of Tommy Hilfiger products in India. Such payments are subject to a $25 million aggregate maximum and are due within 60 days following each one-year period. We made contingent purchase price payments of $429,000 and $185,000 during 2013 and 2012, respectively. In connection with the transaction, we recorded an expense of $21 million in 2011 due to the settlement of an unfavorable contract as a result of a pre-existing relationship with the licensee, as the license provided favorable terms to the licensee. Calvin Klein Contingent Purchase Price Payments In connection with our acquisition of Calvin Klein in 2003, we are obligated to pay Mr. Calvin Klein contingent purchase price payments based on 1.15% of total worldwide net sales (as defined in the agreement governing that acquisition, as amended) of products bearing any of the Calvin Klein brands with respect to sales made through February 12, 2018. A significant portion of the sales on which the payments to Mr. Klein are made are wholesale sales by us and our licensees and other partners to retailers. Such contingent purchase price payments totaled $53 million, $51 million and $51 million in 2013, 2012 and 2011, respectively. We currently expect that such payments will be approximately $55 million in 2014. Dividends Our common stock currently pays annual dividends totaling $0.15 per share. Holders of our Series A convertible preferred stock participated in common stock dividends on an as-converted basis through 2012. The last outstanding shares of Series A convertible preferred stock were converted at the end of 2012 and the series has since been eliminated. Dividends on common stock totaled $12 million, $11 million and $11 million during 2013, 2012 and 2011, respectively. We currently project that cash dividends on our common stock in 2014 will be approximately $12 million based on our current dividend rate, the number of shares of our common stock outstanding as of February 2, 2014 and our estimates of stock to be issued during 2014 under our stock incentive plans. 40 Financing Arrangements Our capital structure was as follows: (in millions) February 2, 2014 February 3, 2013 Short-term borrowings $ 7 $ 11 Current portion of long-term debt 85 88 Capital lease obligations 25 31 Long-term debt 3,878 2,212 Stockholders equity 4,335 3,253 In addition, we had $593 million and $892 million of cash and cash equivalents as of February 2, 2014 and February 3, 2013 , respectively.

One of our Asian subsidiaries acquired as part of the Warnaco acquisition has Rupee-denominated short-term revolving credit facilities with a local lender. These facilities provide for total borrowings of up to 195 million ($3 million based on exchange rates in effect on February 2, 2014) and are utilized to fund working capital needs. Borrowings under these facilities bear interest at various interest rates, primarily based on a base rate set by the lending bank. As of February 2, 2014, we had $2 million of borrowings outstanding under these facilities and the weighted average interest rate on the funds borrowed at February 2, 2014 was 6.97%. The maximum amount of borrowings outstanding under these facilities during 2013 was approximately $3 million. One of our Asian subsidiaries acquired as part of the Warnaco acquisition has a short-term $10 million revolving credit facility to be used to fund working capital needs. Borrowings under this facility bear interest at 1.75% plus the one-month London interbank borrowing rate ( LIBOR ). At the end of each month, amounts outstanding under this facility may be carried forward for additional one-month periods for up to one year. This facility was renewed in December 2013 and may be renewed annually in the future. This facility is subject to certain terms and conditions and may be terminated at any time at the discretion of the lender. There were no borrowings outstanding under this facility as of or during the year ended February 2, 2014. One of our Asian subsidiaries acquired as part of the Warnaco acquisition has a Won-denominated short-term revolving credit facility with one lender that provides for borrowings of up to 3.000 billion ($3 million based on exchange rates in effect on February 2, 2014) and is utilized to fund working capital needs. Borrowings under this facility bear interest at the three-month Cost of Funds Index rate plus a specified margin.

Borrowings under these 41 facilities bear interest at various interest rates. There were no borrowings outstanding under these facilities as of or during the year ended February 2, 2014. In addition, we have certain other facilities, under which we had no borrowings outstanding as of or during the year ended February 2, 2014. Capital Lease Obligations Our cash payments for capital lease obligations totaled $10 million, $11 million and $10 million in 2013, 2012 and 2011, respectively. 4 1/2% Senior Notes Due 2022 On December 20, 2012, we issued $700 million principal amount of 4 1/2% senior notes due December 15, 2022 in connection with the Warnaco acquisition. Interest on the 4 1/2% notes is payable semi-annually in arrears on June 15 and December 15 of each year, beginning on June 15, 2013. We paid $16 million of fees in the first quarter of 2013 in connection with the issuance of these notes, which will be amortized over the term of the notes. We may redeem some or all of these notes at any time prior to December 15, 2017 by paying a make whole premium plus any accrued and unpaid interest. Subject to certain conditions, we may also redeem up to 35% of these notes prior to December 15, 2015 with the net cash proceeds of certain equity offerings without having to pay a penalty or make whole premium. In addition, we may redeem some or all of these notes on or after December 15, 2017 at specified redemption prices plus any accrued and unpaid interest. 7 3/8% Senior Notes Due 2020 On May 6, 2010, we issued $600 million principal amount of 7 3/8% senior notes due May 15, 2020. Interest on the 7 3/8% notes was payable semi-annually in arrears on May 15 and November 15 of each year. During the fourth quarter of 2012, we received the requisite consents from holders of these notes to amend the indenture governing the notes. The amendment increased the amount of secured indebtedness that we are permitted to incur without equally and ratably securing the notes. Under the terms of the consent solicitation, we paid $6 million during that quarter to the holders. In March 2014, in connection with the refinancing of our term loans as discussed below in the section entitled 2013 Senior Secured Credit Facilities, we redeemed all of these notes and, pursuant to the terms of the indenture under which the notes were issued, paid a make whole premium of $68 million to the holders of the notes. 7 3/4% Debentures Due 2023 We have outstanding $100 million of debentures due on November 15, 2023 with a yield to maturity of 7.80%. The debentures accrue interest at the rate of 7 3/4%, which is payable semi-annually. 2011 Senior Secured Credit Facilities On May 6, 2010, we entered into senior secured credit facilities, which were amended and restated on March 2, 2011 (the 2011 facilities ). The 2011 facilities consisted of a Euro-denominated Term Loan A facility, a United States dollar-denominated Term Loan A facility, a Euro-denominated Term Loan B facility, a United States dollar-denominated Term Loan B facility, a United States dollar-denominated revolving credit facility and two multi-currency (one United States dollar and Canadian dollar, and the other Euro, Japanese Yen and British Pound) revolving credit facilities. The 2011 facilities provided for initial borrowings of up to an aggregate of approximately $1.970 billion (based on applicable exchange rates on March 2, 2011), consisting of (i) an aggregate of approximately $1.520 billion of term loan facilities; and (ii) approximately $450 million of revolving credit facilities. We made payments of $451 million on our term loans under the 2011 facilities and paid $11 million of fees in cash in connection with the modification of these facilities in 2011. We made additional payments of $300 million on our term loans under the 2011 facilities during 2012. 42 On February 13, 2013, in connection with the Warnaco acquisition, we modified and extinguished the 2011 facilities and repaid all outstanding borrowings thereunder, as discussed in the section entitled 2013 Senior Secured Credit Facilities below. 2013 Senior Secured Credit Facilities On February 13, 2013, simultaneously with and related to the closing of the Warnaco acquisition, we entered into new senior secured credit facilities (the 2013 facilities ), the proceeds of which were used to fund a portion of the acquisition, repay all outstanding borrowings under the 2011 facilities and repay all of Warnaco previously outstanding long-term debt. The 2013 facilities consist of a $1.700 billion United States dollar-denominated Term Loan A (recorded net of an original issue discount of $7 million as of the acquisition date), a $1.375 billion United States dollar-denominated Term Loan B (recorded net of an original issue discount of $7 million as of the acquisition date) and senior secured revolving credit facilities in an aggregate principal amount of $750 million (based on the applicable exchange rates on February 13, 2013), consisting of (a) a $475 million United States dollar-denominated revolving credit facility, (b) a $25 million United States dollar-denominated revolving credit facility available in United States dollars or Canadian dollars and (c) a 186 million Euro-denominated revolving credit facility available in Euro, Pounds Sterling, Japanese Yen and Swiss Francs. In connection with entering into the 2013 facilities and repaying all outstanding borrowings under the 2011 facilities and all of Warnaco previously outstanding long-term debt, we paid in 2013 debt issuance costs of $67 million (of which $35 million was expensed as debt modification and extinguishment costs and $33 million is being amortized over the term of the related debt agreement) and recorded additional debt modification and extinguishment costs of $6 million to write-off previously capitalized debt issuance costs. The revolving credit facilities include amounts available for letters of credit. As of February 2, 2014, we had drawn no revolving credit borrowings and approximately $56 million of letters of credit. During 2013, we made payments of $500 million on our term loans under the 2013 facilities, the majority of which was voluntary. As of February 2, 2014, we had total term loans outstanding of $2.564 billion, net of original issue discounts. The terms of each of Term Loan A and Term Loan B contain a mandatory quarterly repayment schedule. Due to the above-mentioned voluntary payments, we are not required to make any additional mandatory repayments under Term Loan B prior to maturity. A portion of both United States dollar-denominated revolving credit facilities is also available for the making of swingline loans. The issuance of such letters of credit and the making of any swingline loan reduces the amount available under the applicable revolving credit facility. So long as certain conditions are satisfied, we may add one or more term loan facilities or increase the commitments under the revolving credit facilities by an aggregate amount not to exceed the greater of (a) $750 million and (b) $1.250 billion as long as the ratio of our senior secured net debt to consolidated adjusted earnings before interest, taxes, depreciation and amortization (in each case calculated as set forth in the documentation relating to the 2013 facilities) would not exceed 3 to 1 after giving pro forma effect to the incurrence of such increase, plus, in either case, an amount equal to the aggregate revolving commitments of any defaulting lender (to the extent the commitments with respect thereto have been terminated). The lenders under the 2013 facilities are not required to provide commitments with respect to such additional facilities or increased commitments. On March 21, 2014 (the Restatement Date ), we entered into an amendment (the Amendment ) to the 2013 facilities (as amended by the Amendment, the 2014 facilities ). Among other things, the Amendment provides for an additional $350 million principal amount of Term Loan A and an additional $250 million principal amount of Term Loan B and extends the maturity of the Term Loan A and the revolving credit facilities from February 13, 2018 to February 13, 2019. The maturity of the Term Loan B remains February 13, 2020. On the Restatement Date, we borrowed the additional $350 million principal amount of Term Loan A and the additional $250 million principal amount of Term Loan B made available pursuant to the 2014 facilities. The following is a description of the material terms of the 2014 facilities: The 2014 facilities consist of a $1.986 billion United States Dollar-denominated Term Loan A, a $1.189 billion United States Dollar-denominated Term Loan B and senior secured revolving credit facilities consisting of (a) a $475 million United States Dollar denominated revolving credit facility, (b) a $25 million United States Dollar denominated revolving credit facility available in United States Dollars or Canadian Dollars and (c) a 186 million Euro-denominated revolving credit facility available in Euro, Pounds Sterling, Japanese Yen and Swiss Francs. 43 We have fully drawn the term loans under the 2014 facilities. The revolving credit facilities include amounts available for letters of credit. A portion of each of the United States dollar-denominated revolving credit facilities is also available for the making of swingline loans. The issuance of such letters of credit and the making of any swingline loan reduces the amount available under the applicable revolving credit facility. So long as certain conditions are satisfied, we may add one or more term loan facilities or increase the commitments under the revolving credit facilities by an aggregate amount not to exceed the sum of (1) the sum of (x) $1.350 billion plus (y) the aggregate amount of all voluntary prepayments of term loans under the facilities and the revolving credit facilities (to the extent, in the case of voluntary prepayments of loans under the revolving credit facilities, there is an equivalent permanent reduction of the revolving commitments) plus (z) an amount equal to the aggregate revolving commitments of any defaulting lender (to the extent the commitments with respect thereto have been terminated) and (2) an additional unlimited amount as long as the ratio of our senior secured net debt to consolidated adjusted earnings before interest, taxes, depreciation and amortization (in each case calculated as set forth in the documentation relating to the 2014 facilities) would not exceed 3 to 1 after giving pro forma effect to the incurrence of such increase. The lenders under the 2014 facilities are not required to provide commitments with respect to such additional facilities or increased commitments. Obligations of ours under the 2014 facilities are guaranteed by substantially all of our existing and future direct and indirect United States subsidiaries, with certain exceptions. Obligations of the European Borrower under the 2014 facilities are guaranteed by us, substantially all of our existing and future direct and indirect United States subsidiaries (with certain exceptions) and Tommy Hilfiger Europe B.V., a wholly owned subsidiary of ours. We and our domestic subsidiary guarantors have pledged certain of our assets as security for the obligations under the 2014 facilities. The terms of the Term Loan A facility require us to repay quarterly amounts outstanding under such facility, commencing with the quarter ending June 30, 2014. Such amounts will equal 5.00% per annum of the principal amount outstanding on the Restatement Date for the first eight full calendar quarters following the Restatement Date, 7.50% per annum of the principal amount for the four quarters thereafter and 10.00% per annum of the principal amount for the remaining quarters, in each case paid in equal installments and in each case subject to certain customary adjustments, with the balance due on the maturity date of the Term Loan A facility. The terms of the Term Loan B facility require us to repay the outstanding principal amount thereof on the maturity date of the Term Loan B facility. (As of the Restatement Date, we had, through voluntary and mandatory prepayments of amounts outstanding under the Term Loan B facility prior to the Restatement Date, reduced the required quarterly principal payments under the Term Loan B facility set forth in the 2013 facilities such that the only remaining payment is the outstanding principal amount of the Term Loan B facility on the maturity date of the Term Loan B facility.) The outstanding borrowings under the 2014 facilities are prepayable at any time without penalty (other than customary breakage costs and, solely with respect to the Term Loan B facility, any prepayment in connection with a Repricing Event (as defined in the 2014 facilities) that is consummated on or prior to the six-month anniversary of the Restatement Date). The terms of the 2014 facilities require us to repay certain amounts outstanding thereunder with (a) net cash proceeds of the incurrence of certain indebtedness, (b) net cash proceeds of certain asset sales or other dispositions (including as a result of casualty or condemnation) that exceed certain thresholds, to the extent such proceeds are not reinvested or committed to be reinvested in the business in accordance with customary reinvestment provisions, and (c) a percentage of excess cash flow, which percentage is based upon our net leverage ratio during the relevant fiscal period. The United States Dollar-denominated borrowings under the 2014 facilities bear interest at a rate equal to an applicable margin plus, as determined at our option, either (a) a base rate determined by reference to the greater of (i) the prime rate, (ii) the United States federal funds rate plus 1/2 of 1.00% and (iii) a one-month adjusted Eurocurrency rate plus 1.00% (provided, that, with respect to the Term Loan B facility, in no event will the base rate be deemed to be less than 1.75%) or (b) an adjusted Eurocurrency rate, calculated in a manner set forth in the 2014 facilities (provided, that, with respect to the Term Loan B facility, in no event will the adjusted Eurocurrency rate be deemed to be less than 0.75%). Canadian Dollar-denominated borrowings under the 2014 facilities bear interest at a rate equal to an applicable margin plus, as determined at our option, either (a) a Canadian prime rate determined by reference to the greater of (i) the rate of interest per annum that Royal Bank of Canada establishes at its main office in Toronto, Ontario as the reference rate of interest in order to determine interest rates for loans in Canadian Dollars to its Canadian borrowers and (ii) the sum of (x) the average of the rates per annum for Canadian Dollar bankers acceptances having a term of one month that appears on the display referred to as CDOR Page of Reuters Monitor Money Rate Services as of 10:00 a.m. (Toronto time) on the date of determination, as reported by the administrative agent (and if such screen is not available, any successor or similar service as may be selected by the administrative agent), and (y) 0.75%, or (b) an adjusted Eurocurrency rate, calculated in a manner set forth in the 2014 facilities. 44 The borrowings under the 2014 facilities in currencies other than United States Dollars or Canadian Dollars bear interest at a rate equal to an applicable margin plus an adjusted Eurocurrency rate, calculated in a manner set forth in the 2014 facilities. The initial applicable margin with respect to the Term Loan A facility and each revolving credit facility will be 1.75% for adjusted Eurocurrency rate loans and 0.75% for base rate loans, respectively. The initial applicable margin with respect to the Term Loan B facility will be 2.50% for adjusted Eurocurrency rate loans and 1.50% for base rate loans, respectively. After the date of delivery of the compliance certificate and financial statements with respect to our fiscal quarter in which the Amendment occurred ( i.e. , our fiscal quarter ending May 4, 2014), the applicable margin for borrowings under the Term Loan A facility, the Term Loan B facility and the revolving credit facilities will be subject to adjustment based upon our net leverage ratio. The 2014 facilities require us to comply with customary affirmative, negative and financial covenants. The 2014 facilities require us to maintain a minimum interest coverage ratio and a maximum net leverage ratio. The method of calculating all of the components used in such financial covenants is set forth in the 2014 facilities. The 2014 facilities contain customary events of default, including but not limited to nonpayment; material inaccuracy of representations and warranties; violations of covenants; certain bankruptcies and liquidations; cross-default to material indebtedness; certain material judgments; certain events related to the Employee Retirement Income Security Act of 1974, as amended; certain events related to certain of the guarantees by us and certain of our subsidiaries, and certain pledges of our assets and those of certain of our subsidiaries, as security for the obligations under the 2014 facilities; and a change in control (as defined in the 2014 facilities). On March 24, 2014, we redeemed all of our outstanding 7 3/8% senior notes due May 15, 2020 (the Notes ), representing an aggregate principal amount of $600 milllion. The redemption price of the Notes was 111.272% of the outstanding aggregate principal amount, plus accrued and unpaid interest thereon to, but not including, the redemption date. We incurred pre-tax costs totaling approximately $90 million in 2014 in connection with the Amendment and the redemption described above. During 2013, we entered into an interest rate swap agreement for a three-year term commencing on August 19, 2013. The agreement was designed with the intended effect of converting an initial notional amount of $1.229 billion of our variable rate debt obligation under our United States dollar-denominated senior secured Term Loan A facility, or any replacement facility with similar terms, to fixed rate debt. The agreement remains outstanding, with a notional amount of $1.091 billion as of February 2, 2014. Under the terms of the agreement for the then-outstanding notional amount, our exposure to fluctuations in the one-month LIBOR is eliminated, and we will pay a fixed rate of 0.604%, plus the current applicable margin. During 2011, we entered into an interest rate swap agreement for a three-year term commencing on June 6, 2011. The agreement was designed with the intended effect of converting an initial notional amount of $632 million of our variable rate debt obligation under our previously outstanding United States dollar-denominated senior secured Term Loan A facility, or any replacement facility with similar terms, to fixed rate debt. Such agreement remains outstanding, with a notional amount of $326 million as of February 2, 2014. Under the terms of the agreement for the then-outstanding notional amount, our exposure to fluctuations in the three-month LIBOR is eliminated, and we will pay a fixed rate of 1.197%, plus the current applicable margin. The outstanding notional amount of each interest rate swap will be adjusted according to pre-set schedules during the term of each swap agreement such that, based on our projections for future debt repayments, our outstanding debt under the Term Loan A facility is expected to always equal or exceed the then-outstanding combined notional amount of the interest rate swaps. In addition, during 2011, we entered into an interest rate cap agreement for a 15-month term commencing on June 6, 2011. The agreement was designed with the intended effect of capping the interest rate on an initial notional amount of 166 million of our variable rate debt obligation under the previously outstanding Euro-denominated senior secured Term Loan A and B facilities. Such cap agreement expired September 6, 2012. The 2013 and 2014 facilities contain covenants that restrict our ability to finance future operations or capital needs, to take advantage of other business opportunities that may be in our interest or to satisfy our obligations under our other outstanding debt. These covenants restrict our ability to, among other things: 45 incur or guarantee additional debt or extend credit; make restricted payments, including paying dividends or making distributions on, or redeeming or repurchasing, our capital stock or certain debt; make acquisitions and investments; dispose of assets; engage in transactions with affiliates; enter into agreements restricting our subsidiaries ability to pay dividends; create liens on our assets or engage in sale/leaseback transactions; and effect a consolidation or merger, or sell, transfer, or lease all or substantially all of our assets. The 2013 and 2014 facilities require us to comply with certain financial covenants, including minimum interest coverage and maximum net leverage. A breach of any of these operating or financial covenants would result in a default under the applicable facility. If an event of default occurs and is continuing, the lenders could elect to declare all amounts then outstanding, together with accrued interest, to be immediately due and payable which would result in acceleration of our other debt. If we were unable to repay any such borrowings when due, the lenders could proceed against their collateral, which also secures some of our other indebtedness. We are also subject to similar covenants and restrictions in connection with our other long-term debt agreements. As of February 2, 2014, we were in compliance with all applicable financial and non-financial covenants. As of February 2, 2014, our corporate credit was rated Ba2 by Moody with a stable outlook and our issuer credit was rated BB+ by Standard & Poor with a stable outlook. Upon the announcement in February 2014 of our intent to refinance our term loans, both ratings were reaffirmed and Moody revised our outlook to positive from stable. In assessing our credit strength, we believe that both Moody and Standard & Poor considered, among other things, our capital structure and financial policies as well as our consolidated balance sheet, our historical acquisition activity and other financial information, as well as industry and other qualitative factors. Contractual Obligations The following table summarizes, as of February 2, 2014 , our contractual cash obligations by future period: Payments Due by Period Description Total Obligations 2014 2015-2016 2017-2018 Thereafter (dollars in millions) Long-term debt (1) $ 3,975 $ 85 $ 276 $ 1,275 $ 2,339 Interest payments on long-term debt 977 157 297 258 265 Short-term borrowings 7 7 Operating and capital leases (2) 2,286 437 672 495 682 Inventory purchase commitments (3) 1,184 1,184 Minimum contractual royalty payments (4) 67 16 23 16 12 Non-qualified supplemental defined benefit plans (5) 18 2 4 3 9 Sponsorship payments (6) 18 7 10 1 Severance payments (7) 34 24 10 Other contractual obligations (8) 25 24 1 Total contractual cash obligations $ 8,591 $ 1,943 $ 1,293 $ 2,048 $ 3,307 ______________________ (1) At February 2, 2014 , we had outstanding $1.636 billion under a senior secured Term Loan A facility and $939 million under a senior secured Term Loan B facility, which require mandatory payments through February 13, 2020 (according to the mandatory repayment schedules and prior to the refinancing of these facilities, as discussed above), $600 million of 7 3/8% senior unsecured notes due May 15, 2020 (prior to the March 2014 redemption of these notes, as discussed above), $700 million of 4 1/2% senior unsecured notes due December 15, 2022 and $100 million of 46 7 3/4% debentures due November 15, 2023. Please refer to the section above entitled 2013 Senior Secured Credit Facilities for discussion of the changes in our debt structure that would impact the above contractual obligations. (2) Includes retail store, warehouse, showroom, office and equipment operating leases, as well as capital leases. Retail store operating leases generally provide for payment of direct operating costs in addition to rent. The obligation amounts listed include future minimum lease payments and exclude such direct operating costs. Please refer to Note 15, Leases, in the Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements included in Item 8 of this report for further information. (3) Represents contractual commitments for goods on order and not received or paid for as of February 2, 2014 . Substantially all of these goods are expected to be received and the related payments are expected to be made within six months of our year end. This amount does not include foreign currency exchange forward contracts that we have entered into to manage our exposure to exchange rate changes with respect to certain of these purchases. Please refer to Note 9, Derivative Financial Instruments, in the Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements included in Item 8 of this report for further information. (4) Our minimum contractual royalty payments arise under numerous license agreements we have with third parties, each of which has different terms. Agreements typically require us to make minimum payments to the licensors of the licensed trademarks based on expected or required minimum levels of sales of licensed products, as well as additional royalty payments based on a percentage of sales when our sales exceed such minimum sales. Certain of our license agreements require that we pay a specified percentage of net sales to the licensor for advertising and promotion of the licensed products, in some cases requiring a minimum amount to be paid. Any advertising payments, with the exception of minimum payments to licensors, are excluded from the minimum contractual royalty payments shown in the table. There is no guarantee that we will exceed the minimum payments under any of these license agreements. However, given our projected sales levels for products covered under these agreements, we currently anticipate that future payments required under our license agreements on an aggregate basis will exceed the contractual minimums shown in the table. (5) We have an unfunded non-qualified supplemental defined benefit plan covering three current and 15 retired executives under which the participants will receive a predetermined amount during the 10 years following the attainment of age 65, provided that prior to the termination of employment with us, the participant has been in such plan for at least 10 years and has attained age 55. (6) Represents payment obligations for sponsorships. We have agreements relating to our sponsorship of the Barclay Center, the Brooklyn Nets and certain other professional sports teams and athletes and other similar sponsorships. (7) Represents severance payment obligations primarily related to the acquisition and integration of Warnaco. (8) Represents a payment of $10 million to PVH Australia to contribute our 50% share of the joint venture funding, a payment of $5 million to acquire two additional Tommy Hilfiger stores in Russia from a former Tommy Hilfiger franchisee and other miscellaneous contractual obligations. Not included in the above table are contingent purchase price payments we are obligated to pay Mr. Calvin Klein based on 1.15% of total worldwide net sales, as defined in the agreement (as amended) governing the Calvin Klein acquisition, of products bearing any of the Calvin Klein brands and are required to be made with respect to sales made through February 12, 2018. A significant portion of the sales on which the payments to Mr. Klein are made are wholesale sales by us and our licensees and other partners to retailers. Such contingent purchase price payments totaled $53 million, $51 million and $51 million in 2013, 2012 and 2011, respectively. Not included in the above table are contingent purchase price payments we are obligated to pay GVM into 2016 (or, under certain circumstances, into 2017) based on a percentage of annual sales in excess of an agreed upon threshold of Tommy Hilfiger products in India. Such payments are subject to a $25 million aggregate maximum and are due within 60 days following each one-year period. We made contingent purchase price payments of $429,000 and $185,000 during 2013 and 2012, respectively. Not included in the above table are contributions to our defined benefit qualified pension plans, or payments to employees and retirees in connection with our supplemental executive retirement, supplemental pension and postretirement health plans. Contractual cash obligations for these plans cannot be determined due to the number of assumptions required to estimate our future benefit obligations, including return on assets, discount rate and future compensation increases. The liabilities associated with these plans are presented in Note 11, Retirement and Benefit Plans, in the Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements included in Item 8 of this report. We currently estimate that we will make contributions of approximately $3 million to our pension plans in 2014. Our actual contributions may differ from our planned contributions due to many 47 factors, including changes in tax and other benefit laws, or significant differences between expected and actual pension asset performance or interest rates. Not included in the above table are $541 million of net potential cash obligations associated with uncertain tax positions due to the uncertainty regarding the future cash outflows associated with such obligations. Please refer to Note 8, Income Taxes, in the Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements included in Item 8 of this report for further information related to uncertain tax positions. Not included in the above table are $17 million of asset retirement obligations related to leased office and retail store locations due to the uncertainty of timing of future cash outflows associated with such obligations. Please refer to Note 21, Other Comments, in the Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements included in Item 8 of this report for further information related to asset retirement obligations. Not included in the above table are obligations related to our non-exclusive buying agency agreement with Li & Fung due to uncertainty of the timing and amounts of future cash flows associated with such obligations. Under the terms of the agreement, we are required to use Li & Fung for at least 54% of our global sourcing needs for Tommy Hilfiger products, or otherwise pay a penalty. The buying agency agreement with Li & Fung is terminable by us upon 12 months prior notice for any reason, and is terminable by either party (i) upon six months prior notice in the event of a material breach by the other party and (ii) immediately upon the occurrence of certain bankruptcy or insolvency events relating to the other party. Not included in the above table are contractual royalty obligations related to our perpetual license agreement with Speedo International Limited. Under the terms of the agreement, our contractual minimum payments each year are $1 million, which is subject to annual increases based on the Consumer Price Index. Off-Balance Sheet Arrangements We do not have any off-balance sheet arrangements that have a material current effect, or that are reasonably likely to have a material future effect, on our financial position, changes in financial position, revenue, expenses, results of operations, liquidity, capital expenditures or capital resources. MARKET RISK INTEREST AND EXCHANGE RATE SENSITIVITY Financial instruments held by us as of February 2, 2014 include cash and cash equivalents, short and long-term debt, foreign currency forward exchange contracts and interest rate swap agreements. Note 10, Fair Value Measurements, in the Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements included in Item 8 of this report outlines the fair value of our financial instruments as of February 2, 2014 . Cash and cash equivalents held by us are affected by short-term interest rates. Due to the currently low rates of return we are receiving on our cash equivalents, the potential for a significant decrease in short-term interest rates is low and, therefore, a further decrease would not have a material impact on our interest income. However, there is potential for a more significant increase in short-term interest rates, which could have a more material impact on our interest income. Given our balance of cash and cash equivalents at February 2, 2014 , the effect of a 10 basis point increase in short-term interest rates on our interest income would be approximately $600,000 annually. In March 2014, we amended and restated our 2013 senior secured credit facilities, borrowed an additional $600 million under the facilities and redeemed $600 million principal amount 7 3/8% senior notes due May 15, 2020. Please refer to Note 22, Subsequent Events (Unaudited), in the Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements included in Item 8 of this report for a further discussion of our refinanced credit facility. Borrowings under our 2014 senior secured credit facilities bear interest at a rate equal to an applicable margin plus a variable rate. As such, our credit facilities expose us to market risk for changes in interest rates. As noted above in the section entitled Financing Arrangements, we had previously entered into interest rate swap agreements for the intended purpose of reducing our exposure to interest rate volatility. As of April 1, 2014, after taking into account the effect of those interest rate swap agreements, approximately 55% of our total debt was at a fixed rate, with the remainder at variable rates. Given our debt position at April 1, 2014, the effect of a 10 basis point increase in interest rates on our interest expense would be approximately $600,000 annually. Such amount excludes any impact from our United States dollar-denominated Term Loan B facility, which would currently not be impacted by a 10 basis point increase in interest rates due to its adjusted Eurocurrency rate floor of 0.75%. Please refer to Note 7, Debt, in the Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements included in Item 8 of this report for a further discussion of our credit facilities and interest rate swap agreements. Our Calvin Klein and Tommy Hilfiger businesses each have substantial international components, which expose us to significant foreign exchange risk. Accordingly, the impact of a strengthening United States dollar, particularly against the Euro, the Brazilian Real, the Japanese Yen, the Korean Won, the British Pound, the Canadian dollar, the Mexican Peso, the Indian 48 Rupee and the Chinese Yuan, will have a negative impact on our results of operations. Our Calvin Klein and Tommy Hilfiger businesses purchase the majority of the products that they sell in United States dollars, which exposes the international operations of each of these businesses to foreign exchange risk as the United States dollar fluctuates. To help manage these exposures, we currently use and plan to continue to use foreign currency forward exchange contracts or other derivative instruments. In addition, we have exposure to changes in foreign currency exchange rates on certain intercompany loans. We currently use and plan to continue to use foreign currency forward exchange contracts to mitigate this exposure. SEASONALITY Our business generally follows a seasonal pattern. Our wholesale businesses tend to generate higher levels of sales in the first and third quarters, while our retail businesses tend to generate higher levels of sales in the fourth quarter. Royalty, advertising and other revenue tends to be earned somewhat evenly throughout the year, although the third quarter has the highest level of royalty revenue due to higher sales by licensees in advance of the holiday selling season. We expect this seasonal pattern will generally continue. RECENT ACCOUNTING PRONOUNCEMENTS The Financial Accounting Standards Board ( FASB ) issued in February 2013 guidance that requires an entity to provide information about significant amounts reclassified out of accumulated other comprehensive income ( AOCI ). For amounts that are required to be reclassified in their entirety to net income in the same reporting period, an entity must report the amounts by component and their corresponding effect on the respective line items of net income. Such information is required to be presented either on the face of the financial statements or as a separate disclosure in the footnotes to the financial statements. For other amounts that are not required to be reclassified to net income in their entirety, an entity is required to cross-reference to other disclosures. We adopted this guidance during the first quarter of 2013 and elected to present a separate disclosure in the Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements. The adoption did not have any impact on our consolidated results of operations or financial position. The FASB issued in March 2013 guidance that requires an entity to release any related cumulative translation adjustment into net income when it ceases to have a controlling financial interest in a subsidiary that is a foreign entity if the sale or transfer results in the complete or substantially complete liquidation of the foreign entity. For an equity method investment that is a foreign entity, a pro rata portion of the cumulative translation adjustment related to the investment should be released into net income upon a partial sale of such investment. This guidance becomes effective for us in the first quarter of 2014. The adoption is not expected to have a material impact on our consolidated results of operations or financial position. The FASB issued in July 2013 guidance that requires an entity to present an uncertain tax position, or a portion of an uncertain tax position, in the financial statements as a reduction to a deferred tax asset for a net operating loss carryforward, a similar tax loss or a tax credit carryforward. However, to the extent (i) a net operating loss carryforward, a similar tax loss or a tax credit carryforward is not available at the reporting date under the tax law of the applicable jurisdiction to settle any additional income taxes that would result from the disallowance of a tax position or (ii) the tax law of the applicable jurisdiction does not require the entity to use, and the entity does not intend to use, the deferred tax asset for such purpose, the uncertain tax position should be presented in the financial statements as a liability and should not be combined with deferred tax assets. This guidance becomes effective prospectively for us in the first quarter of 2014. The adoption is not expected to have any impact on our consolidated results of operations or financial position. CRITICAL ACCOUNTING POLICIES AND ESTIMATES Our consolidated financial statements are based on the selection and application of significant accounting policies, which require management to make significant estimates and assumptions. Our significant accounting policies are outlined in Note 1, Summary of Significant Accounting Policies, in the Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements included in Item 8 of this report. We believe that the following are the more critical judgmental areas in the application of our accounting policies that currently affect our financial position and results of operations: Sales allowances and returns We have arrangements with many of our department and specialty store customers to support their sales of our products. We establish accruals which, based on a review of the individual customer arrangements and the expected performance of our products in their stores, we believe will be required to satisfy our sales allowance obligations. We also establish accruals, which are based on historical data and authorized amounts, that we believe are necessary to provide 49 for sales allowances and inventory returns. It is possible that the accrual estimates could vary from actual results, which would require adjustment to the allowance and returns accruals. Inventories Inventories are comprised principally of finished goods and are stated at the lower of cost or market. Cost for principally all wholesale apparel inventories in North America and certain wholesale and retail apparel inventories in Asia and Latin America is determined using the first-in, first-out method. Cost for all other inventories is determined using the weighted average cost method. We review current business trends, inventory agings and discontinued merchandise categories to determine adjustments which we estimate will be needed to liquidate existing clearance inventories and reduce inventories to the lower of cost or market. We believe that all inventory writedowns required at February 2, 2014 have been recorded. If market conditions were to change, it is possible that the required level of inventory reserves would need to be adjusted. Asset impairments During 2013, 2012 and 2011, we determined that the long-lived assets in certain of our retail stores and other locations were not recoverable, which resulted in us recording impairment charges. In order to calculate the impairment charges, we estimated the undiscounted future cash flows and the related fair value of each asset. The undiscounted future cash flows for each asset were estimated using current sales trends and other factors. If different assumptions had been used for future sales trends, the recorded impairment charges could have been significantly higher or lower. Note 10, Fair Value Measurements, in the Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements included in Item 8 of this report includes a further discussion of the circumstances surrounding the impairments and the assumptions related to the impairment charges. Allowance for doubtful accounts Accounts receivable, as presented on our Consolidated Balance Sheets, is net of an allowance for doubtful accounts. An allowance for doubtful accounts is determined through an analysis of the aging of accounts receivable and assessments of collectibility based on historic trends, the financial condition of our customers and an evaluation of economic conditions. Because we cannot predict future changes in economic conditions and in the financial stability of our customers, actual future losses from uncollectible accounts may differ from our estimates and could impact our allowance for doubtful accounts. Income taxes Deferred income tax balances reflect the effects of temporary differences between the carrying amounts of assets and liabilities and their tax bases and are stated at enacted tax rates expected to be in effect when taxes are actually paid or recovered. FASB guidance on accounting for income taxes requires that deferred tax assets be evaluated for future realization and reduced by a valuation allowance to the extent we believe a portion will not be realized. We consider many factors when assessing the likelihood of future realization of our deferred tax assets, including our recent earnings experience and expectations of future taxable income by taxing jurisdiction, the carryforward periods available to us for tax reporting purposes and other relevant factors. The actual realization of deferred tax assets may differ significantly from the amounts we have recorded. During the ordinary course of business, there are many transactions and calculations for which the ultimate tax determination is uncertain. Accounting for income taxes requires a two-step approach to recognizing and measuring uncertain tax positions. The first step is to evaluate the tax position for recognition by determining if available evidence indicates it is more likely than not that the tax position will be fully sustained upon review by taxing authorities, including resolution of related appeals or litigation processes, if any. The second step is to measure the tax benefit as the largest amount with a greater than 50 percent likelihood of being realized upon ultimate settlement. For tax positions that are 50 percent or less likely of being sustained upon audit, we do not recognize any portion of that benefit in the financial statements. We consider many factors when evaluating and estimating our tax positions and tax benefits, which may require periodic adjustments and which may not accurately anticipate actual outcomes. Our actual results could differ materially from our current estimates. Goodwill and other intangible assets Goodwill and other indefinite-lived intangible assets are tested for impairment annually, at the beginning of the third quarter of each fiscal year, and between annual tests if an event occurs or circumstances change that would indicate the carrying amount may be impaired. Impairment testing for goodwill is done at a reporting unit level. A reporting unit is defined as an operating segment or one level below an operating segment, called a component. However, two or more components of an operating segment will be aggregated and deemed a single reporting unit if the components have similar economic characteristics. We adopted in 2012 new authoritative accounting guidance that allows us to first assess qualitative factors to determine whether it is necessary to perform a more detailed quantitative impairment test for goodwill and indefinite-lived intangible assets. We would perform the quantitative test if our qualitative assessment determined it is more likely than not that the fair value of a reporting unit or intangible asset is less than its carrying amount. We may elect to bypass the qualitative assessment and proceed directly to the quantitative test for any reporting unit or asset. Qualitative factors that we consider as part of our assessment include a comparison of the most recent valuation to reporting unit carrying amounts, an increase in our 50 market capitalization and its implied impact on reporting unit fair value, industry and market conditions, macroeconomic conditions, trends in product costs and financial performance of our businesses. If we perform the quantitative test for any reporting units, we use a discounted cash flow method to calculate fair value. The discounted cash flow method is based on the present value of projected cash flows. Assumptions used in these cash flow projections are generally consistent with our internal forecasts. The estimated cash flows are discounted using a rate that represents the weighted average cost of capital. The weighted average cost of capital is based on a number of variables, including the equity-risk premium and risk-free interest rate. Management believes the assumptions used for the impairment tests are consistent with those that would be utilized by a market participant performing similar analyses and valuations. Any projected cash flows and estimates of weighted average cost of capital may be impacted by adverse changes in market and economic conditions and are subject to change based on the facts and circumstances that exist at the time of the valuation. No impairment of goodwill or other indefinite-lived intangible assets resulted from our impairment tests in 2013. If different assumptions for our goodwill and other indefinite-lived intangible asset impairment tests had been applied, significantly different outcomes could have resulted. Based upon the results of our annual goodwill impairment testing during 2013 and our future cash flow projections, we currently do not believe that any of our reporting units are at significant risk for a future material goodwill impairment. Pension benefits Included in the calculations of expense and liabilities for our pension plans are various assumptions, including return on assets, discount rate and future compensation increases. Note 11, Retirement and Benefit Plans, in the Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements included in Item 8 of this report sets forth the significant rate assumptions used in performing certain calculations related to our pension plans. Actual results could differ from these assumptions, which would require adjustments to our balance sheet and could result in volatility in our future pension expense. Holding all other assumptions constant, a 1% increase or decrease in the assumed rate of return on assets would decrease or increase, respectively, 2014 net benefit cost by approximately $6 million. Likewise, a 0.25% increase or decrease in the assumed discount rate would decrease or increase, respectively, 2014 net periodic pension expense by approximately $24 million. Actuarial gains and losses are recognized in our operating results in the year in which they occur. These gains and losses are measured at least annually at the end of our fiscal year and, as such, are generally recorded during the fourth quarter of each year. Stock-based compensation Accounting for stock-based compensation requires measurement of compensation cost for all stock-based awards at fair value on the date of grant and recognition of compensation over the service period for awards expected to vest. We use the Black-Scholes-Merton option pricing model to determine the fair value of our stock options. This model uses assumptions that include the risk-free interest rate, expected volatility, expected dividend yield and expected life of the options. The fair value of restricted stock units and restricted stock are determined based on the quoted price of our common stock on the date of grant. The fair value of our stock options, restricted stock units and restricted stock is recognized as expense over the service period, net of estimated forfeitures. The fair value of contingently issuable performance shares that are not based on market conditions is based on the quoted price of our common stock on the date of grant, reduced for the present value of any dividends expected to be paid on our common stock during the performance cycle, as the contingently issuable performance shares do not accrue dividends prior to being earned. We record expense for contingently issuable performance shares that are not based on market conditions based on our current expectations of the probable number of shares that will ultimately be issued. The fair value of contingently issuable performance shares that are subject to market conditions was established using a Monte Carlo Simulation model. We record expense for the awards that are subject to market conditions ratably over the vesting period, net of estimated forfeitures, regardless of whether the market condition is satisfied. The estimation of stock awards that will ultimately vest requires judgment, and to the extent actual results or updated estimates differ from our current estimates, such amounts will be recorded as a cumulative adjustment in the period estimates are revised. We consider many factors when estimating expected forfeitures, including types of awards, employee class and historical experience. Actual results and future estimates may differ substantially from our current estimates.
