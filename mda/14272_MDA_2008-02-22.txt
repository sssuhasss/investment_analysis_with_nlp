Item 7. MANAGEMENT S DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS OF FINANCIAL CONDITION AND RESULTS OF OPERATIONS. EXECUTIVE SUMMARY About the Company Bristol-Myers Squibb Company (BMS, the Company or Bristol-Myers Squibb) is a global biopharmaceutical and related health care products company whose mission is to extend and enhance human life by providing the highest quality pharmaceutical and related health care products. The Company is engaged in the discovery, development, licensing, manufacturing, marketing, distribution and sale of pharmaceuticals and related health care products. The Company has three reportable segments Pharmaceuticals, Nutritionals and ConvaTec. The Pharmaceuticals segment consists of the global pharmaceutical/biotechnology and international consumer medicines business, which accounted for approximately 81% of the Company 2007 net sales. The Nutritionals segment consists of Mead Johnson Nutritionals (Mead Johnson), primarily an infant formula and children nutritionals business, which accounted for approximately 13% of the Company 2007 net sales. The ConvaTec segment consists of ostomy, wound and skin care business, which accounted for approximately 6% of the Company 2007 net sales and was previously included in the Other Health Care operating segment. In January 2008, the Company completed the sale of its Medical Imaging business to Avista Capital Partners L.P. (Avista). The results of the Medical Imaging business, previously included in the former Other Health Care operating segment, are presented as part of the Company results from discontinued operations. 2007 Financial Highlights Worldwide net sales from continuing operations for 2007 increased 12% to $19.3 billion compared to 2006. PLAVIX* (clopidogrel bisulfate) sales grew 46%, primarily reflecting the adverse impact of generic competition from August 2006 to mid-2007, as well as strong underlying sales growth. The other key products within the Company Pharmaceuticals segment, including AVAPRO*/AVALIDE* (irbesartan/irbesartan-hydrochlorothiazide), REYATAZ (atazanavir sulfate), the SUSTIVA (efavirenz) Franchise and ABILIFY* (aripiprazole) experienced double digit sales growth for the year. Sales of the Company newer specialty and biologics medicines BARACLUDE (entecavir), ORENCIA (abatacept) and SPRYCEL (dasatinib) continue to be strong. In addition, the Company launched IXEMPRA (ixabepilone) for the treatment of metastatic or locally advanced breast cancer. Overall worldwide sales growth, however, was moderated by a significant decline in PRAVACHOL (pravastatin sodium) sales due to generic competition. Net earnings from continuing operations were $2.0 billion in 2007 compared with $1.4 billion in 2006. The 2007 results include a $230 million charge for acquired in-process research and development related to the purchase of Adnexus Therapeutics, Inc. (Adnexus), a $292 million charge in connection with the Company three-year Productivity Transformation Initiative (PTI) and a $275 million impairment charge of the Company investment in certain auction rate securities (ARS). The 2006 results include a $353 million increase in reserves for a pricing and sales litigation settlement and $220 million in early debt retirement costs. Additionally, the Company also recorded gains on sale of product assets and properties of $273 million and $200 million in 2007 and 2006, respectively. In December 2007, the Company announced that the Board of Directors (the Board) declared an 11 percent dividend increase, the first increase since 2002. The dividend increase will result in a quarterly dividend of thirty-one cents ($.31) per share on the Company Common Stock for an indicative dividend for the full year of 2008 of $1.24 per share, subject to the normal quarterly review by the Board. Business Environment The Company conducts its business primarily within the pharmaceutical/biotechnology industry, which is highly competitive and subject to numerous government regulations. Many competitive factors may significantly affect the Company sales of its products, including product efficacy, safety, price and cost-effectiveness, marketing effectiveness, product labeling, quality control and quality assurance of its manufacturing operations, and research and development of new products. To successfully compete for business in the health care industry, the Company must demonstrate that its products offer medical benefits, as well as cost advantages. Currently, most of the Company new product introductions compete with other products already on the market in the same therapeutic category, in addition to potential competition of new products that competitors may introduce in the future. The Company manufactures branded products, which are priced higher than generic products. Generic competition is one of the Company leading challenges globally. In the pharmaceutical/biotechnology industry, the majority of an innovative product commercial value is usually realized during the period that the product has market exclusivity. When a product loses exclusivity, it is no longer protected by a patent and is 40 Table of Contents subject to new competing products in the form of generic brands. Upon exclusivity loss, the Company can lose a major portion of that product sales in a short period of time. Currently, generic versions of biological products cannot be approved under U.S. law. However, the law could change in the future. Even in the absence of new legislation, the U.S. Food and Drug Administration (FDA) is taking steps toward allowing generic versions of certain biologics. Competitors seeking approval of biological products must file their own safety and efficacy data, and address the challenges of biologics manufacturing, which involves more complex processes and are more costly than those of traditional pharmaceutical operations. Both in the U.S. and internationally, the health care industry is subject to various government-imposed regulations that authorize prices or price controls that have and will continue to have an impact on the Company sales. In the U.S., Congress and some state legislatures have considered a number of proposals and have enacted laws that could effect major changes in the health care system, either nationally or at the state level. Driven in part by budget concerns, Medicaid access and reimbursement restrictions have been implemented in some states and proposed in many others. In addition, the Medicare Prescription Drug Improvement and Modernization Act provides outpatient prescription drug coverage to senior citizens in the U.S. This legislation has had a modest favorable impact on the Company, as a result of an increase in the number of seniors with drug coverage. There continues to be a potential negative impact on the U.S. pharmaceutical business that could result from pricing pressures or controls. In many markets outside the U.S., the Company operates in environments of government-mandated, cost-containment programs, or under other regulatory bodies or groups that can exert downward pressure on pricing. Pricing freedom is limited in the United Kingdom (UK), for instance, by the operation of a profit control plan and in Germany by the operation of a reference price system. Companies also face significant delays in market access for new products and more than two years can elapse after drug approval before new medicines become available in some national markets. The growth of Managed Care Organizations (MCOs) in the U.S. has played a large role in the competition that surrounds the health care industry. MCOs seek to reduce health care expenditures for participants by making volume purchases and entering into long-term contracts to negotiate discounts with various pharmaceutical providers. Because of the market potential created by the large pool of participants, marketing prescription drugs to MCOs has become an important part of the Company strategy. Companies compete for inclusion in a MCO formulary and the Company has generally been successful in having its major products included. The Company believes that developments in the managed care industry, including continued consolidation, have had and will continue to have a generally downward pressure on prices. Pharmaceutical/biotechnology production processes are complex, highly regulated and vary widely from product to product. Shifting or adding manufacturing capacity can be a lengthy process requiring significant capital expenditures and regulatory approvals. Biologics manufacturing involves more complex processes than those of traditional pharmaceutical operations. As biologics become more important to the Company product portfolio, the Company will continue to make arrangements with third-party manufacturers, and to make substantial investments to increase its internal capacity to produce biologics on a commercial scale. One such investment is the building of a new state-of-the-art manufacturing facility for the production of biologics in Devens, Massachusetts, the construction of which began in May 2007. The Company has maintained a competitive position in the market and strives to uphold this position, which is dependent on its success in discovering and developing innovative, cost-effective products that serve unmet medical need. Recently, several of the Company competitors have announced cost reduction programs in an effort to reduce their respective cost bases and increase their productivity and competitiveness. The Company has also announced a three-year PTI to reduce costs, streamline operations and rationalize global manufacturing as part of its efforts to become a more productive and competitive biopharmaceutical company. The Company and its subsidiaries are the subject of a number of significant pending lawsuits, claims, proceedings and investigations. It is not possible at this time reasonably to assess the final outcome of these investigations or litigations. For additional discussion of legal matters, see Item 8. Financial Statements Note 22. Legal Proceedings and Contingencies. Strategy In December 2007, the Company outlined its multi-year strategy designed to transform the Company into a next-generation biopharmaceutical company. The strategy encompasses all aspects and all geographies of the business and will yield substantial cost savings and cost avoidance and increase the Company financial flexibility to take advantage of attractive market opportunities that may arise. As the Company develops into a next-generation biopharmaceutical company, it will continue to invest in key growth products, including specialty and biologic medicines, and cardiovascular and metabolic drugs. The Company continues to execute its ongoing strategy for long-term growth through the scale back of assets in its profitable, though declining, mature brands and increased focus 41 Table of Contents on key and new growth products, which include PLAVIX*, ABILIFY*, AVAPRO*/AVALIDE*, REYATAZ, the SUSTIVA Franchise, ERBITUX* (cetuximab), ORENCIA, BARACLUDE, SPRYCEL and IXEMPRA. The Company experienced the last of a series of major anticipated exclusivity losses in 2006 and does not expect any significant new exclusivity losses for the next several years. In order to support the production of specialty products in the pharmaceutical portfolio, including biologics, the Company completed a land purchase in 2007 of an 89-acre site to locate its new large-scale, expandable multi-project bulk biologics manufacturing facility in Devens, Massachusetts. The Company has committed $750 million to fund the construction of the facility which began in May 2007. The facility is projected to be operationally complete in 2009, and the Company plans to submit the site for regulatory approval in 2010. Commercial production of biologic compounds is anticipated to begin in 2011. In addition, the Company expanded its Manati, Puerto Rico facility, with the expansion targeted for start-up in 2008. The new state-of-the-art facility, as well as the expanded Manati, Puerto Rico facility, will support the filling and finishing of the Company sterile products and biologic compounds, including ORENCIA, the Company first internally discovered and developed biologic medicine, and commercial quantities of compounds currently in development should those compounds receive regulatory approval. In keeping with its strategy, the Company invested $3.3 billion in research and development, representing a 10% growth rate over 2006. Research and development dedicated to pharmaceutical products, including milestone payments for in-licensing and development programs, was $3.1 billion compared to $2.8 billion in 2006. Consistent with the Company objective to maximize the value of its non-pharmaceutical businesses, in January 2008, the Company completed the sale of its Medical Imaging business to Avista. The Company will continue to seek opportunities to maximize the value of its remaining Health Care Group businesses. As it transitions into a next-generation biopharmaceutical company, the Company seeks to reallocate resources to enable strategic acquisitions, such as the acquisition of Adnexus in October 2007, as well as pursue partnerships and other collaborative arrangements, such as the worldwide alliance with AstraZeneca PLC (AstraZeneca) to discover, develop and commercialize saxagliptin and dapagliflozin and the two separate agreements with Pfizer Inc. (Pfizer) for the research, development and commercialization of a Pfizer discovery program and for the development and commercialization of apixaban. Productivity Transformation Initiative The Company undertook a broad range of actions in the fourth quarter of 2007 as part of the previously announced three-year PTI, which is reducing costs, streamlining operations and rationalizing global manufacturing. The initiative, which is on track to achieve $1.5 billion in annual cost savings and cost avoidance on a pre-tax basis by 2010, is central to the Company strategy to become a more nimble and flexible next generation biopharmaceutical enterprise. Key productivity initiatives include reducing general and administrative operations by simplifying, standardizing and outsourcing, where appropriate, processes and services, rationalizing the Company mature brands portfolio, consolidating its global manufacturing network while eliminating complexity and enhancing profitability, simplifying its geographic footprint and implementing a more efficient go-to-market model. Specific productivity goals include reducing the number of brands in the Company mature products portfolio by 60 percent between 2007 and 2011, reducing the number of manufacturing facilities by more than 50 percent by the end of 2010, and reducing total headcount by approximately 10 percent between 2007 and 2010. Some positions have been eliminated in 2007, although the substantial majority of positions will be eliminated in 2008 and 2009. Among the many productivity activities across the entire organization in the fourth quarter of 2007 are the impending closure of several manufacturing facilities, including Mayaguez, Puerto Rico and Barceloneta, Puerto Rico. Costs associated with the implementation of the PTI are estimated to be between $0.9 billion to $1.1 billion on a pre-tax basis, with $292 million incurred in 2007 and approximately $500 million expected to be incurred in 2008. The ultimate timing of the recording of the charges cannot be predicted with certainty and will be affected by the occurrence of triggering events for expense recognition under U.S. Generally Accepted Accounting Principles (GAAP), among other factors. 42 Table of Contents New Product and Pipeline Developments In December 2007, the Company and Medarex, Inc. (Medarex) announced top-line data from the three registrational trials (008, 022, 007) that constitute the monotherapy program for ipilimumab in patients with metastatic melanoma. The results from study 008, conducted under Special Protocol Assessment, did not meet the primary endpoint, which was to rule out a best objective response rate of less than 10 percent. However, the totality of data from the registrational program included a clear dose response effect observed in study 022 and best objective response rates across the three studies ranging from mid-single digits to mid-teens as determined by independent radiology review. After the receipt of additional data from ongoing clinical trials, the companies plan to meet with the FDA to discuss the regulatory pathway, with the goal of submitting a regulatory filing by the middle of 2008, if supported by the data. In November 2007, the Company and Pierre Fabre Medicament S.A. (Pierre Fabre) announced the termination of the license agreement for the development of vinflunine, a chemotherapy agent under investigation for the treatment of advanced or metastatic bladder cancer and other tumor types. In November 2007, ABILIFY* was approved by the FDA as adjunctive, or add-on, treatment to antidepressant therapy in adults with major depressive disorder (MDD). ABILIFY* is the first medication approved by the FDA as add-on treatment for MDD. The FDA also approved ABILIFY* for the treatment of schizophrenia in adolescent patients (ages 13-17) and accepted for Priority Review the supplemental New Drug Application (sNDA) for the treatment of pediatric patients (ages 10-17) with Bipolar I Disorder. An update to the SPRYCEL label to include a lower recommended starting dose of 100 mg once daily, from 70 mg twice daily, as a starting dose for patients with chronic-phase chronic myeloid leukemia resistant or intolerant to imatinib was approved by the FDA in November 2007 and by the European Commission in August 2007. During the first quarter of 2007, SPRYCEL received approval and/or reimbursement in additional European markets, including Ireland, Norway, Sweden and Greece, and was also approved in Canada and New Zealand. In October 2007, ATRIPLA* (efavirenz 600 mg/emtricitabine 200 mg/tenofovir disoproxil fumarate 300 mg) was approved in Canada as the first once-daily single-tablet regimen for the treatment of human immunodeficiency virus-1 infection in adults. In December 2007, the European Commission granted marketing authorization for ATRIPLA*, formally approving it for commercialization in the 27 countries of the European Union (EU), as well as in Norway and Iceland. ATRIPLA* has been launched in the UK, Germany and Austria. In October 2007, the Company launched IXEMPRA, for the treatment of patients with metastatic or locally advanced breast cancer, in the U.S. In addition, the Japanese New Drug Application for ixabepilone was submitted in December 2007, and the Marketing Authorization Application for ixabepilone is under review by the European Medicines Evaluation Agency (EMEA), following submission in September 2007. In October 2007, the Company acquired privately-held Adnexus, developer of a new therapeutic class of biologics called ADNECTINS. ADNECTINS are a proprietary class of targeted biologics based on a naturally occurring protein found in human serum. In October 2007, the Company and ImClone Systems Incorporated (ImClone) announced that the FDA approved an update to the ERBITUX* product labeling to include overall survival data as a single agent in epidermal growth factor inhibitor (EGFR)-expressing metastatic colorectal cancer (mCRC) patients after the failure of both irinotecan- and oxaliplatin-based regiments. In September, the Company and ImClone announced that a Phase III study of ERBITUX* in combination with platinum-based chemotherapy, conducted by Merck KGaA, met its primary endpoint of increasing overall survival compared with chemotherapy alone in patients with advanced non-small cell lung cancer. As previously disclosed, an earlier study conducted by ImClone and the Company evaluating the use of ERBITUX* in combination with a different platinum-based therapy did not meet its primary endpoint of increasing progression-free survival in patients with advanced non-small cell lung cancer. Key secondary endpoints of this study, however, were statistically significant and favored the ERBITUX*-containing arm. In September 2007, the FDA approved a sNDA for a single 300 mg tablet of PLAVIX*. The 300 mg loading dose has been proven effective in a broad acute coronary syndrome patient population. The 300 mg tablet of clopidogrel bisulfate was launched in the U.S. in December 2007 and is currently under EMEA review. In August 2007, the Company and Pfizer finalized the collaborative agreement for the research, development and commercialization of a Pfizer discovery program which includes advanced pre-clinical compounds with potential applications for the treatment of metabolic disorders, including obesity and diabetes. The Company recorded an upfront charge of $60 million in accordance with the terms of the agreement. Pfizer will be responsible for all research and early-stage development activities for the metabolic disorders program, and the companies will jointly conduct Phase III development and commercialization activities. The companies will share all development and commercialization expenses along with profits/losses on a 60%-40% basis, with Pfizer assuming the larger share of both expenses and profits/losses. 43 Table of Contents In August 2007, the FDA accepted, for filing and review, the supplemental Biologics License Application for ORENCIA for the treatment of pediatric patients with juvenile idiopathic arthritis. ORENCIA was approved by the European Commission in May 2007, and has received approval and/or reimbursement in several European markets, including the UK, Germany, Austria, Sweden, the Netherlands and Denmark. In April 2007, the FDA approved an update to the ORENCIA product labeling regarding the progression of structural joint damage an important measure in the treatment of rheumatoid arthritis (RA). The indication was strengthened from slowing to inhibiting the progression of structural damage in adult patients with moderately to severely active RA who have had an inadequate response to one or more disease-modifying anti-rheumatic drugs, such as methotrexate or tumor necrosis factor antagonists. In July 2007, the Company and ImClone amended the terms of their agreement for the codevelopment and copromotion of ERBITUX* in North America. Under this amendment, the companies have jointly agreed to expand the investment in the ongoing clinical development plan for ERBITUX*. Development costs, up to a threshold value, will be the sole responsibility of the Company; costs in excess of this threshold will be shared by both companies according to a pre-determined ratio. With this additional funding, the companies intend to further explore the use of ERBITUX* in additional tumor types including brain, breast, bladder, gastric, lung, pancreas and prostate. In May 2007, the Company and Isis Pharmaceuticals, Inc. (Isis) entered into a collaborative agreement to discover, develop and commercialize novel antisense drugs targeting proprotein convertase subtilisin kexin 9 for the prevention and treatment of cardiovascular disease. The Company made an upfront payment of $15 million to Isis as part of this agreement and will provide Isis with at least $9 million in research funding over a period of three years. In April 2007, the Company and Pfizer entered into a worldwide collaboration to develop and commercialize apixaban, an anticoagulant discovered by the Company being studied for the prevention and treatment of a broad range of venous and arterial thrombotic conditions. In accordance with the terms of the agreement, Pfizer made upfront payments of $250 million and $40 million to the Company in May 2007 and December 2007, respectively. Pfizer will fund 60% of all development costs effective January 1, 2007 going forward, and the Company will fund 40%. The Company may also receive additional payments of up to $780 million from Pfizer based on development and regulatory milestones. The companies will jointly develop the clinical and marketing strategy of apixaban, and will share commercialization expenses and profits/losses equally on a global basis. In February 2007, BARACLUDE was added to the American Association for the Study of Liver Disease treatment guidelines for hepatitis B as a first-line treatment option. BARACLUDE also received approval and/or reimbursement in additional European markets, including Italy, throughout the first quarter of 2007. In January 2007, the Company entered into two worldwide (except for Japan) codevelopment and cocommercialization agreements with AstraZeneca to develop and commercialize two investigational compounds being studied for the treatment of type 2 diabetes. The Company received upfront payments of $100 million from AstraZeneca. In addition, the Company will receive milestone payments from AstraZeneca upon successful achievement of various regulatory and sales related stages. The companies have agreed upon initial development plans for the two compounds. From 2007 through 2009, the majority of development costs will be paid by AstraZeneca and any subsequent development costs will generally be shared equally. In July 2007, the companies decided to move the investigational compound dapagliflozin, a selective inhibitor of the sodium-glucose transporter 2 being studied for the treatment of diabetes, into Phase III testing based on results of Phase II clinical trials. In December 2006, the Company entered into a collaboration agreement with Exelixis Pharmaceuticals, Inc. (Exelixis) to discover, develop and commercialize novel targeted therapies for the treatment of cancer. The agreement became effective in January 2007 and in accordance with the terms of the agreement, the Company made an upfront payment of $60 million to Exelixis. In January 2008, the Company exercised an option to develop and commercialize compounds targeting one therapeutic target and paid Exelixis $20 million in February 2008. Exelixis is also eligible to receive $20 million for each of up to two additional investigational drug candidates selected by the Company. At the option of Exelixis, the companies will share equally all development costs along with commercial profits in the U.S.; otherwise, the Company will be responsible for development and will pay development milestones and royalties to Exelixis. 44 Table of Contents RESULTS OF OPERATIONS The following discussions of the Company results of continuing operations exclude the results related to the Medical Imaging business, which was previously presented as a component of the former Other Health Care operating segment prior to its divestiture in January 2008, and the Oncology Therapeutics Network (OTN) business, which was previously presented as a separate operating segment prior to its divestiture in 2005. These businesses have been segregated from continuing operations and reflected as discontinued operations for all periods presented. See Discontinued Operations below. The Company results of operations were as follows: 2007 2006 2005 % Change Dollars in Millions 2007 vs. 2006 2006 vs. 2005 Net Sales $ 19,348 $ 17,256 $ 18,605 12 % (7 )% Earnings from Continuing Operations Before Minority Interest and Income Taxes $ 3,534 $ 2,400 $ 4,304 47 % (44 )% % of net sales 18.3 % 13.9 % 23.1 % Provision for Income Taxes $ 803 $ 538 $ 870 49 % (38 )% Effective tax rate 22.7 % 22.4 % 20.2 % Net Earnings from Continuing Operations $ 1,968 $ 1,422 $ 2,842 38 % (50 )% % of net sales 10.2 % 8.2 % 15.3 % Net Sales Net sales from continuing operations for 2007 increased 12% to $19.3 billion, including a 3% favorable foreign exchange impact, compared to 2006.

The Company operates in three reportable segments Pharmaceuticals, Nutritionals and ConvaTec (previously a component of the Other Health Care operating segment). In January 2008, the Company completed the sale to Avista of the Medical Imaging business, which was previously presented as a component of the Other Health Care operating segment. In May 2005, the Company completed the sale of OTN, which was previously presented as a separate operating segment. As such, the results of operations for Medical Imaging and OTN are presented as part of the Company results from discontinued operations in accordance with Statement of Financial Standards (SFAS) No. 144, Accounting for the Impairment or Disposal of Long-Lived Assets. Accordingly, Medical Imaging and OTN results of operations in prior periods have been reclassified to discontinued operations to conform with current year presentations. 45 Table of Contents The Company net sales by segment were as follows: Net Sales % Change Dollars in Millions 2007 2006 2005 2007 vs. 2006 2006 vs. 2005 Pharmaceuticals $ 15,622 $ 13,861 $ 15,408 13 % (10 )% % of net sales 81 % 80 % 83 % Nutritionals 2,571 2,347 2,205 10 % 6 % % of net sales 13 % 14 % 12 % ConvaTec 1,155 1,048 992 10 % 6 % % of net sales 6 % 6 % 5 % Health Care Group 3,726 3,395 3,197 10 % 6 % Total $ 19,348 $ 17,256 $ 18,605 12 % (7 )% The Company recognizes revenue net of various sales adjustments to arrive at net sales as reported on the Consolidated Statement of Earnings. These adjustments are referred to as gross-to-net sales adjustments and are further described in Critical Accounting Policies below. The reconciliations of the Company gross sales to net sales by each significant category of gross-to-net sales adjustments were as follows: For the Years Ended December 31, Dollars in Millions 2007 2006 2005 Gross Sales $ 22,175 $ 20,120 $ 22,389 Gross-to-Net Sales Adjustments Prime Vendor Charge-Backs (662 ) (703 ) (1,090 ) Women, Infants and Children (WIC) Rebates (848 ) (872 ) (843 ) Managed Health Care Rebates and Other Contract Discounts (387 ) (322 ) (502 ) Medicaid Rebates (169 ) (174 ) (595 ) Cash Discounts (251 ) (224 ) (271 ) Sales Returns (160 ) (230 ) (164 ) Other Adjustments (350 ) (339 ) (319 ) Total Gross-to-Net Sales Adjustments (2,827 ) (2,864 ) (3,784 ) Net Sales $ 19,348 $ 17,256 $ 18,605 The slight decrease in gross-to-net sales adjustments in 2007 compared to 2006 was affected by a number of factors. Sales returns decreased primarily due to higher accruals in 2006 for Cardiovascular non-exclusive brands and from the discontinued commercialization of TEQUIN (gatifloxacin). The decrease in prime vendor charge-backs was primarily due to lower sales of TAXOL (paclitaxel) as a result of loss of exclusivity. This was partially offset by increases in managed health care rebates and other contract discounts, primarily as a result of higher PLAVIX* sales and the reversal of reserves in 2006 related to the TRICARE Retail Pharmacy Refund Program, partially offset by lower sales of PRAVACHOL due to loss of exclusivity. Additionally, the increase in cash discounts was primarily due to higher PLAVIX* sales volumes. The decrease in gross-to-net sales adjustments in 2006 compared to 2005 was affected by a number of factors, including changes in customer mix and a portfolio shift, in each case towards products that required lower rebates, as well as changes in contract status. The decrease in prime vendor charge-backs was primarily the result of lower PLAVIX* net sales, volume erosion on highly-rebated PARAPLATIN (carboplatin) and TAXOL (paclitaxel) due to generic competition, as well as the impact from the discontinued commercialization of TEQUIN. Managed health care rebates and other contract discounts decreased primarily as a result of the reversal of reserves related to the TRICARE Retail Pharmacy Refund Program, as well as the exclusivity loss of PRAVACHOL, which also reduced Medicaid rebates. In addition, lower PLAVIX* net sales and the shift in patient enrollment from Medicaid to Medicare under Medicare Part D, resulted in a decrease in Medicaid rebates, partially offset by a corresponding increase in managed health care rebates. The decrease in cash discounts was primarily due to lower sales of PRAVACHOL due to loss of exclusivity and lower PLAVIX* sales volumes. The increase in sales returns was primarily due to higher returns trends for non-exclusive brands as well as from the discontinued commercialization of TEQUIN. 46 Table of Contents The activities and ending balances of each significant category of gross-to-net sales adjustments were as follows: Dollars in Millions Prime Vendor Charge-Backs Women, Infants and Children (WIC) Rebates Managed Health Care Rebates and Other Contract Discounts Medicaid Rebates Cash Discounts Sales Returns Other Adjustments Total Balance at January 1, 2006 $ 107 $ 252 $ 167 $ 326 $ 26 $ 185 $ 124 $ 1,187 Provision related to sales made in current period 706 867 355 174 221 200 348 2,871 Provision related to sales made in prior periods (3 ) 5 (33 ) 3 30 (9 ) (7 ) Returns and payments (747 ) (894 ) (380 ) (363 ) (232 ) (196 ) (343 ) (3,155 ) Impact of foreign currency translation 1 2 4 7 Discontinued operations 1 1 Balance at December 31, 2006 63 230 111 137 18 221 124 904 Provision related to sales made in current period 662 845 394 176 250 142 352 2,821 Provision related to sales made in prior periods 3 (7 ) (7 ) 1 18 (2 ) 6 Returns and payments (655 ) (880 ) (360 ) (181 ) (245 ) (207 ) (356 ) (2,884 ) Impact of foreign currency translation 6 4 10 20 Discontinued operations (10 ) (10 ) Balance at December 31, 2007 $ 70 $ 198 $ 134 $ 125 $ 24 $ 178 $ 128 $ 857 In 2007, the Company recorded gross-to-net sales adjustments related to sales made in prior periods. The significant items included charges for sales returns of $18 million primarily related to higher than expected returns for certain non-exclusive products. In 2006, the Company recorded gross-to-net sales adjustments related to sales made in prior periods. The significant items included charges for sales returns of $30 million primarily related to higher than expected return trends for certain non-exclusive products, as well as from the discontinued commercialization of TEQUIN; and credits in other contract discounts of $33 million, primarily due to the reversal of reserves related to the TRICARE Retail Pharmacy Refund Program. No other significant revisions were made to the estimates for gross-to-net sales adjustments in 2007 and 2006. Pharmaceuticals The composition of the change in pharmaceutical sales were as follows: Total Change Analysis of % Change Volume Price Foreign Exchange 2007 vs. 2006 13 % 8 % 2 % 3 % 2006 vs. 2005 (10 )% (12 )% 2 % In 2007, Worldwide Pharmaceuticals sales increased 13% to $15,622 million, including a 3% favorable foreign exchange impact, compared to the same period in 2006. U.S. Pharmaceuticals sales increased 21% to $8,992 million from $7,417 million in 2006, primarily due to increased PLAVIX* sales reflecting the adverse impact of generic competition from August 2006 to mid-2007, as well as strong underlying sales growth. The sales growth was also attributed to increased sales of ABILIFY*, the SUSTIVA Franchise, REYATAZ, AVAPRO*/AVALIDE* and ERBITUX*, and sales of newer products SPRYCEL, ORENCIA, BARACLUDE and IXEMPRA. The increase was partially offset by increased generic competition for PRAVACHOL. International Pharmaceuticals sales increased 3%, including a 6% favorable foreign exchange impact, to $6,630 million in 2007 from $6,444 million in 2006. Excluding the impact of foreign exchange, the decrease in sales was primarily due to increased generic competition for PRAVACHOL and TAXOL (paclitaxel), partially offset by sales growth of ABILIFY*, REYATAZ, PLAVIX* and AVAPRO*/AVALIDE* and newer products BARACLUDE and SPRYCEL. In 2006, Worldwide Pharmaceuticals sales decreased 10% to $13,861 million. U.S. Pharmaceuticals sales decreased 11% to $7,417 million from $8,338 million in 2005, primarily due to lower sales of PLAVIX* resulting from the launch of generic clopidogrel bisulfate in August 2006 and loss of exclusivity of PRAVACHOL, partially offset by continued growth of ABILIFY*, ERBITUX*, REYATAZ, the SUSTIVA Franchise and AVAPRO*/AVALIDE* and sales of newer products including ORENCIA, 47 Table of Contents BARACLUDE and SPRYCEL. International Pharmaceuticals sales decreased 9% to $6,444 million in 2006 from $7,070 million in 2005, primarily due to a decline in PRAVACHOL and TAXOL (paclitaxel) sales resulting from increased generic competition in Europe, partially offset by increased sales of newer products including REYATAZ, ABILIFY* and BARACLUDE. Key pharmaceutical products and their sales, representing 80%, 75% and 71% of total pharmaceutical sales in 2007, 2006 and 2005, respectively, were as follows: 2007 2006 2005 % Change Dollars in Millions 2007 vs. 2006 2006 vs. 2005 Cardiovascular PLAVIX* $ 4,755 $ 3,257 $ 3,823 46 % (15 )% AVAPRO*/AVALIDE* 1,204 1,097 982 10 % 12 % PRAVACHOL 443 1,197 2,256 (63 )% (47 )% COUMADIN 201 220 212 (9 )% 4 % Virology REYATAZ 1,124 931 696 21 % 34 % SUSTIVA Franchise (total revenue) 956 791 680 21 % 16 % BARACLUDE 275 83 12 * * * * Oncology ERBITUX* 692 652 413 6 % 58 % TAXOL (paclitaxel) 422 563 747 (25 )% (25 )% SPRYCEL 158 25 * * IXEMPRA 15 Affective (Psychiatric) Disorders ABILIFY* (total revenue) 1,660 1,282 912 29 % 41 % Immunoscience ORENCIA 231 89 160 % Other Pharmaceuticals EFFERALGAN 308 266 283 16 % (6 )% ** Change is in excess of 200%. Sales of PLAVIX*, a platelet aggregation inhibitor that is part of the Company alliance with Sanofi, increased 46%, including a 1% favorable foreign exchange impact, to $4,755 million in 2007 from $3,257 million in 2006. U.S. sales increased 53% to $4,060 million in 2007 from $2,655 million in 2006. The Company estimates the adverse effect of generic clopidogrel bisulfate, launched in August 2006, to be in the range of $1.2 billion to $1.4 billion for 2006. For 2007, the Company estimates the negative impact of generic clopidogrel bisulfate to be in the range of $250 million to $350 million, as inventory of generic clopidogrel bisulfate in the distribution channels was substantially depleted by June 30, 2007. Estimated total U.S. prescription demand for clopidogrel bisulfate (branded and generic) increased approximately 8% in 2007 compared to 2006, while estimated total U.S. prescription demand for branded PLAVIX* increased 34% in the same period. In 2006, sales decreased 15% to $3,257 million from $3,823 million in 2005. U.S. sales decreased 18% to $2,655 million in 2006 from $3,235 million in 2005. While market exclusivity for PLAVIX* is expected to expire in 2011 in the U.S. and 2013 in the major European markets, the composition of matter patent for PLAVIX* is the subject of litigation. Data exclusivity for PLAVIX* expires in July 2008 in the EU, and the key composition of matter patent expires in 2013 in the majority of the EU member countries. For additional information on the PLAVIX* litigations see Item 8. Financial Statements Note 22. Legal Proceedings and Contingencies. Sales of AVAPRO*/AVALIDE*, an angiotensin II receptor blocker for the treatment of hypertension that is also part of the Sanofi alliance, increased 10%, including a 3% favorable foreign exchange impact, to $1,204 million in 2007 from $1,097 million in 2006. U.S. sales increased 7% to $692 million in 2007 from $647 million in 2006, primarily due to higher average net selling prices. Estimated total U.S. prescription demand decreased approximately 4% in 2007 compared to 2006. International sales increased 14%, including an 8% favorable foreign exchange impact, to $512 million from $450 million in 2006. In 2006, sales increased 12%, including a 1% favorable foreign exchange impact, to $1,097 million from $982 million in 2005. U.S. sales increased 13% to $647 million in 2006 from $574 million in 2005, while international sales increased 10%, including a 2% favorable foreign exchange impact, to $450 million from $408 million in 2005. Market exclusivity for AVAPRO*/AVALIDE* (known in the EU as APROVEL*/KARVEA*) is expected to expire in 2012 (including pediatric extension) in the U.S. and in 2012-2013 in most countries in the EU; the Company does not, but others do, market AVAPRO*/AVALIDE* in Japan. Sales of PRAVACHOL, an HMG Co-A reductase inhibitor, decreased 63%, including a 2% favorable foreign exchange impact, to $443 million in 2007 from $1,197 million in 2006, due to increased generic competition in the U.S. and key European markets. Estimated total U.S. prescription demand decreased approximately 82% in 2007 compared to 2006. In 2006, sales decreased 47% 48 Table of Contents to $1,197 million from $2,256 million in 2005, due to market exclusivity expiration in April 2006 resulting in generic competition for most strengths in the U.S. and generic competition in key European markets. Market exclusivity in the EU ended in 2004, with the exception of Sweden, where expiration occurred in March 2006; Italy, where expiration occurred in January 2008; and France, where generic competition that was not authorized by the Company commenced in July 2006. As previously disclosed, the Company authorized Watson Pharmaceutical to distribute pravastatin sodium tablets in the U.S. Sales of COUMADIN, an oral anticoagulant used predominantly in patients with atrial fibrillation or deep venous thrombosis/pulmonary embolism, decreased 9%, including a 1% favorable foreign exchange impact, to $201 million in 2007 from $220 million in 2006, primarily due to lower demand driven by continued competition, partially offset by higher average net selling prices. Estimated total U.S. prescription demand decreased approximately 16% in 2007 compared to 2006. In 2006, sales increased 4% to $220 million from $212 million in 2005, primarily due to higher average net selling prices, partially offset by lower demand driven by continued competition. Market exclusivity for COUMADIN expired in the U.S. in 1997. Sales of REYATAZ, a protease inhibitor for the treatment of HIV, increased 21%, including a 4% favorable foreign exchange impact, to $1,124 million in 2007 from $931 million in 2006, primarily due to increased demand in the majority of the markets. U.S. sales increased 14% to $587 million in 2007 from $514 million in 2006, primarily due to higher demand. Estimated total U.S. prescription demand increased approximately 13% in 2007 compared to 2006. International sales increased 29%, including an 8% favorable foreign exchange impact, to $537 million in 2007 from $417 million in 2006. In 2006, sales increased 34% to $931 million from $696 million in 2005, primarily due to increased demand in the U.S., Europe and Latin America. Market exclusivity for REYATAZ is expected to expire in 2017 in the U.S., in countries in the EU and Japan. Data exclusivity in the EU expires in 2014. Total revenue for the SUSTIVA Franchise, a non-nucleoside reverse transcriptase inhibitor for the treatment of HIV, increased 21%, including a 4% favorable foreign exchange impact, to $956 million in 2007 from $791 million in 2006. U.S. sales increased 22% to $604 million from $495 million in 2006 primarily due to higher demand, resulting from the successful launch of ATRIPLA* in July 2006. Estimated total U.S. prescription demand for the SUSTIVA Franchise increased approximately 20% in 2007 compared to 2006. International sales increased 19%, including a 10% favorable foreign exchange impact, to $352 million from $296 million in 2006, primarily due to higher demand across all markets. In July 2006, the Company and Gilead Sciences, Inc. (Gilead) launched ATRIPLA*, a once-daily single tablet three-drug regimen for HIV intended as a stand-alone therapy or in combination with other antiretrovirals. Total revenue for the SUSTIVA Franchise includes sales of SUSTIVA, as well as revenue from bulk efavirenz included in the combination therapy ATRIPLA*. The Company records revenue for the bulk efavirenz component of ATRIPLA* upon sales of ATRIPLA* by the joint venture with Gilead to third-party customers. In 2006, sales increased 16% to $791 million from $680 million in 2005 due to higher demand and the launch of ATRIPLA* in the third quarter of 2006. Market exclusivity for SUSTIVA is expected to expire in 2013 in the U.S. and in countries in the EU; the Company does not, but others do, market SUSTIVA in Japan. For additional information on revenue recognition of the SUSTIVA Franchise, see Item 8. Financial Statements Note 2. Alliances and Investments. Sales of BARACLUDE, an oral antiviral agent for the treatment of chronic hepatitis B, increased to $275 million in 2007 from $83 million in 2006 due to continued growth across all markets, including the U.S., China, Japan and Korea. In 2006, sales increased to $83 million from $12 million in 2005. BARACLUDE was launched in the U.S. in April 2005, China in February 2006, the UK and Germany in July 2006 and in France and Japan in September 2006. The Company has a composition of matter patent that expires in the U.S. in 2015, in the EU between 2011 and 2016 and in Japan in 2016. As previously disclosed, there is uncertainty about China exclusivity laws, and due to this uncertainty, it is possible that one or more companies in China could receive marketing authorization from China health authority by 2010. Sales of ERBITUX*, which is sold by the Company almost exclusively in the U.S., increased 6% to $692 million in 2007 from $652 million in 2006, primarily due to increased demand for usage in the treatment of head and neck cancer and a transition to a broader distribution model. In 2006, sales increased 58% to $652 million from $413 million in 2005. ERBITUX* is marketed by the Company under a distribution and copromotion agreement with ImClone. A use patent relating to combination therapy with cytotoxic treatments expires in 2017. There is no patent covering monotherapy. Currently, generic versions of biological products cannot be approved under U.S. law. However, the law could change in the future. Even in the absence of new legislation, the FDA is taking steps toward allowing generic versions of certain biologics. Competitors seeking approval of biological products must file their own safety and efficacy data, and address the challenges of biologics manufacturing, which involves more complex processes and are more costly than those of traditional pharmaceutical operations. The Company right to market ERBITUX* in North America and Japan under its agreement with ImClone expires in September 2018. The Company does not, but others do, market ERBITUX* in countries in the EU. As previously disclosed, ImClone and Yeda Research and Development Company Ltd. (Yeda) have been in litigation over the ownership of the use patent for combination therapy with cytotoxic treatments relating to ERBITUX*. In September 2006, the District court granted Yeda the complete ownership of that patent. Pursuant to a settlement agreement executed by ImClone, Sanofi and Yeda announced in December 2007 to end worldwide litigation related to the use patent. The settlement agreement does not change ImClone worldwide royalty rate for ERBITUX* sales. Under its commercial agreement with ImClone, the Company pays a royalty to ImClone on sales of ERBITUX* that is not impacted by the settlement agreement. For further information pertaining to legal proceedings involving ERBITUX*, see Item 8. Financial Statements Note 22. Legal Proceedings and Contingencies, and Note 2. Alliances and Investments. 49 Table of Contents Sales of TAXOL (paclitaxel), an anti-cancer agent sold almost exclusively in the non-U.S. markets, decreased 25%, including a 1% favorable foreign exchange impact, to $422 million in 2007 from $563 million in 2006, primarily due to increased generic competition in Europe and Japan. In 2006, sales decreased 25%, including a 2% unfavorable foreign exchange impact, to $563 million from $747 million in 2005, primarily due to increased generic competition in Europe and generic entry in Japan during the third quarter of 2006. Market exclusivity protection for TAXOL (paclitaxel) expired in 2000 in the U.S. and in 2003 in countries in the EU. Two generic paclitaxel products have received regulatory approval in Japan, and both have entered the market. Sales of SPRYCEL, an oral inhibitor of multiple tyrosine kinases, for the treatment of adults with chronic, accelerated, or myeloid or lymphoid blast phase chronic myeloid leukemia with resistance or intolerance to prior therapy, including GLEEVEC* (imatinib meslylate), increased to $158 million in 2007 from $25 million in 2006. SPRYCEL was launched in the U.S. in July 2006 and in certain European markets beginning in the fourth quarter of 2006. Market exclusivity for SPRYCEL is expected to expire in 2020 in the U.S. In several EU countries, the patent is pending and, if granted, would expire in 2020. Sales of IXEMPRA, a microtubule inhibitor for the treatment of patients with metastatic or locally advanced breast cancer, were $15 million in 2007. IXEMPRA was launched in the U.S. in October 2007. The Company has a composition of matter patent in the U.S and a corresponding patent in EU countries, both expiring in 2018. The Company has submitted its request for patent term extension for the composition of matter patent in the U.S., which could possibly extent the term of that patent. The corresponding patent in EU countries may be eligible for patent term restoration, which could possibly extend the term of the patent in EU countries. Total revenue for ABILIFY*, an antipsychotic agent for the treatment of schizophrenia, acute bipolar mania and bipolar disorder, increased 29%, including a 2% favorable foreign exchange impact, to $1,660 million in 2007 from $1,282 million in 2006. U.S. sales increased 24% to $1,305 million in 2007 from $1,052 million in 2006, primarily due to higher demand and higher average net selling prices. Estimated total U.S. prescription demand increased approximately 12% in 2007 compared to 2006. In 2006, sales increased 41% to $1,282 million from $912 million in 2005, primarily due to higher demand and higher average net selling prices. Total revenue for ABILIFY* primarily consists of alliance revenue representing the Company 65% share of net sales in countries where it copromotes with Otsuka Pharmaceutical Co., Ltd. (Otsuka) and the product is sold by an Otsuka affiliate as a distributor. Otsuka market exclusivity protection for ABILIFY* is expected to expire in 2014 in the U.S. (including the granted patent term extension). For information on patent litigations relating to ABILIFY*, see Item 8. Financial Statements Note 22. Legal Proceedings and Contingencies. The Company also has the right to copromote ABILIFY* in several European countries (the UK, France, Germany and Spain) and to act as exclusive distributor for the product in the rest of the EU. A composition of matter patent is in force in Germany, the UK, France, Italy, the Netherlands, Romania, Sweden, Switzerland, Spain and Denmark. The original expiration date of 2009 has been extended to 2014 by grant of a supplemental protection certificate in all of the above countries except Romania and Denmark. Data exclusivity in the EU expires in 2014. The Company contractual right to market ABILIFY* expires in November 2012 in the U.S. and Puerto Rico and, for the countries in the EU where the Company has the exclusive right to market ABILIFY* until June 2014. For additional information on revenue recognition of ABILIFY*, see Item 8. Financial Statements Note 2. Alliances and Investments. Sales of ORENCIA, a fusion protein indicated for adult patients with moderate to severe RA who have had an inadequate response to one or more currently available treatments, such as methotrexate or anti-tumor necrosis factor therapy, increased 160%, including a 1% favorable foreign exchange impact, to $231 million in 2007 from $89 million in 2006, primarily due to demand. Substantially all sales of ORENCIA are currently in the U.S., where it was launched in February 2006. ORENCIA was launched in Europe in May 2007. The Company has submitted its request for patent term extension for one of the composition of matter patents that expires in 2015, which could possibly extend the term of the patent. As noted above, generic versions of biological products cannot be approved under U.S. law, but the law could change in the future. Sales of EFFERALGAN (paracetamol), a formulation of acetaminophen for pain relief sold principally in Europe, increased 16%, including a 9% favorable foreign exchange impact, to $308 million in 2007 from $266 million in 2006, primarily due to a severe 2007 flu season. In 2006, sales decreased 6% to $266 million from $283 million in 2005, primarily due to a change in government reimbursement. In most instances, the basic exclusivity loss date indicated above is the expiration date of the patent that claims the active ingredient of the drug or the method of using the drug for the approved indication. In some instances, the basic exclusivity loss date indicated is the expiration date of the data exclusivity period. In situations where there is only data exclusivity without patent protection, a competitor could seek regulatory approval prior to the expiration of the data exclusivity period by submitting its own clinical trial data to obtain marketing approval. The Company assesses the market exclusivity period for each of its products on a case-by-case basis. The length of market exclusivity for any of the Company products is difficult to predict with certainty because of the complex interaction between patent and regulatory forms of exclusivity and other factors. There can be no assurance that a 50 Table of Contents particular product will enjoy market exclusivity for the full period of time that the Company currently anticipates. The estimates of market exclusivities reported above are for business planning purposes only and are not intended to reflect the Company legal opinion regarding the strength or weakness of any particular patent or other legal position. The estimated U.S. prescription change data provided above includes information only from the retail and mail order channels and does not reflect information from other channels, such as hospitals, institutions and long-term care, among others. The estimated prescription data is based on the Next-Generation Prescription Service (NGPS) version 2.0 provided by IMS Health (IMS), a supplier of market research for the pharmaceutical industry, as described below. The Company has calculated the estimated total U.S. prescription change based on NGPS version 2.0 data on a weighted-average basis to reflect the fact that mail order prescriptions include a greater volume of product supplied compared to retail prescriptions. Mail order prescriptions typically reflect a 90-day prescription whereas retail prescriptions typically reflect a 30-day prescription. The calculation is derived by multiplying NGPS mail order prescription data by a factor that approximates three and adding to this the NGPS retail prescriptions. The Company believes that this calculation of the estimated total U.S. prescription change based on the weighted-average approach with respect to the retail and mail order channels provides a superior estimate of total prescription demand. The Company uses this methodology for its internal demand forecasts. 51 Table of Contents Estimated End-User Demand The following tables set forth for each of the Company key pharmaceutical products sold by the U.S. Pharmaceuticals business, for the years ended December 31, 2007, 2006 and 2005: (i) total U.S. net sales for the period; (ii) change in reported U.S. net sales for the period; (iii) estimated total U.S. prescription change for the retail and mail order channels calculated by the Company based on NGPS version 2.0 on a weighted-average basis and (iv) months of inventory on hand in the distribution channel.

The estimated prescription change data reported throughout this Annual Report on Form 10-K only include information from the retail and mail order channels and do not reflect information from other channels, such as hospitals, institutions and long-term care, among others. The data provided by IMS are a product of IMS own recordkeeping processes and are themselves estimates based on IMS sampling procedures, subject to the inherent limitations of estimates based on sampling and a margin of error. The Company continuously seeks to improve the quality of its estimates of prescription change amounts and ultimate patient/consumer demand through review of its methodologies and processes for calculation of these estimates and review and analysis of its own and third parties data used in such calculations. The Company expects that it will continue to review and refine its methodologies and processes for calculation of these estimates and will continue to review and analyze its own and third parties data used in such calculations. Pursuant to the U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC) Consent Order described below under SEC Consent Order , the Company monitors the level of inventory on hand in the U.S. wholesaler distribution channel and, outside of the U.S., in the direct customer distribution channel. The Company is obligated to disclose products with levels of inventory in excess of one month on hand or expected demand, subject to a de minimis exception. The following products had estimated levels of inventory in the distribution channel in excess of one month on hand as of (1) in the case of the Company U.S. Pharmaceuticals products, December 31, 2007 and (2) in the case of the Company International Pharmaceuticals, Nutritionals and ConvaTec products, December 31, 2007 and/or September 30, 2007. At December 31, 2007, KENALOG had approximately 1.1 months of inventory on hand in the U.S. wholesaler distribution channel. The estimated value of KENALOG inventory in the U.S. wholesaler distribution channel over one month on hand was approximately $0.3 million at December 31, 2007. The increased level of inventory on hand at December 31, 2007 was due to the volatile demand for the product in the fourth quarter of 2007 as a result of a temporary product supply shortage. The Company expects to work down wholesaler inventory levels to one month on hand or less in the first quarter of 2008. 53 Table of Contents As of December 31, 2007, DAFALGAN, an analgesic product sold principally in Europe, had approximately 1.2 months of inventory on hand at direct customers compared to approximately 1.1 months of inventory on hand at September 30, 2007. The increased level of inventory on hand was due primarily to private pharmacists purchasing DAFALGAN approximately once every eight weeks and the seasonality of the product. As of December 31, 2007, MONOPRIL, a cardiovascular product, had approximately 1.1 months of inventory on hand at direct customers compared to 1.2 months of inventory on hand at September 30, 2007. The increased level of inventory on hand as of December 31, 2007 was due primarily to initial stocking of a new, exclusive distributor in Poland and stocking in support of the launch of MONOPRIL in Poland in 2007. As of December 31, 2007, VIDEX/VIDEX EC, an antiviral product, had approximately 1.3 months of inventory on hand at direct customers compared to 1.4 months of inventory on hand at September 30, 2007. The increased level of inventory on hand was due primarily to government purchasing patterns in Brazil. The Company is contractually obligated to provide VIDEX/VIDEX EC to the Brazilian government upon placement of an order for product by the government. Under the terms of the contract, the Company has no control over the inventory levels relating to such orders. As of December 31, 2007, the Ostomy business had approximately 1.1 months of inventory on hand at direct customers, compared to 0.9 months of inventory on hand at September 30, 2007. The increased level of inventory was due primarily to increased purchases by a significant wholesaler in anticipation of a price increase. In the U.S., for all products sold exclusively through wholesalers or through distributors, the Company determines its months on hand estimates using information with respect to inventory levels of product on hand and the amount of out-movement of products provided by the Company three largest wholesalers, which accounted for approximately 90% of total gross sales of U.S. Pharmaceuticals products in 2007, and provided by the Company distributors. Factors that may influence the Company estimates include generic competition, seasonality of products, wholesaler purchases in light of increases in wholesaler list prices, new product launches, new warehouse openings by wholesalers and new customer stockings by wholesalers. In addition, such estimates are calculated using third-party data, which represent their own record-keeping processes and, as such, may also reflect estimates. For pharmaceutical products in the U.S. that are not sold exclusively through wholesalers or distributors and for the Company Pharmaceuticals business outside of the U.S., Nutritionals and ConvaTec business units around the world, the Company has significantly more direct customers, limited information on direct customer product level inventory and corresponding out-movement information and the reliability of third-party demand information, where available, varies widely. In cases where direct customer product level inventory, ultimate patient/consumer demand or out-movement data do not exist or are otherwise not available, the Company has developed a variety of other methodologies to calculate estimates of such data, including using such factors as historical sales made to direct customers and third-party market research data related to prescription trends and end-user demand. Accordingly, the Company relies on a variety of methods to estimate direct customer product level inventory and to calculate months on hand for these business units. Factors that may affect the Company estimates include generic competition, seasonality of products, direct customer purchases in light of price increases, new product or product presentation launches, new warehouse openings by direct customers, new customer stockings by direct customers and expected direct customer purchases for governmental bidding situations. HEALTH CARE GROUP The Health Care Group consists of the Nutritionals and the ConvaTec operating segments. The Nutritionals operating segment consists of Mead Johnson Nutritionals, primarily an infant formula and children nutritionals business. The ConvaTec operating segment consists of the ostomy, wound and skin care business. The following discussions exclude sales related to the Medical Imaging business, a discontinued operation, which was previously included as a component of the former Other Health Care segment. The combined 2007 revenues from the Health Care Group increased 10% to $3,726 million from 2006. The combined 2006 revenues from the Health Care Group increased 6% to $3,395 million from $3,197 million in 2005. 54 Table of Contents Nutritionals The composition of the change in Nutritionals sales were as follows: Analysis of % Change Total Change Volume Price Foreign Exchange 2007 vs. 2006 10% 3% 4% 3% 2006 vs. 2005 6% 2% 3% 1% Key Nutritionals product lines and their sales, representing 96%, 96% and 95% of total Nutritional sales in 2007, 2006 and 2005, respectively, were as follows: 2007 2006 2005 % Change Dollars in Millions 2007 vs. 2006 2006 vs. 2005 Infant Formulas $ 1,786 $ 1,637 $ 1,576 9% 4% ENFAMIL 1,082 1,007 992 7% 2% Toddler/Children Nutritionals 693 606 529 14% 15% ENFAGROW 295 262 206 13% 27% Worldwide Nutritionals sales increased 10%, including a 3% favorable foreign exchange impact, to $2,571 million in 2007 from 2006.

International Nutritionals sales increased 15%, including a 6% favorable foreign exchange impact, to $1,443 million in 2007 from 2006, primarily due to increased sales of toddler and children nutritional products and ENFAMIL, the Company best selling infant formula. In 2006, international Nutritionals sales increased 11%, including a 3% favorable foreign exchange impact, to $1,256 million from $1,135 million in 2005, primarily due to increased sales of children nutritional products. U.S. Nutritionals sales were $1,128 million, $1,091 million and $1,070 million in 2007, 2006 and 2005, respectively. The 3% increase in sales in 2007 and the 2% increase in sales in 2006 were primarily due to increased sales for ENFAMIL.

In 2006, international ConvaTec sales increased 4%, including a 1% favorable foreign exchange impact, to $705 million from 2005, primarily due to growth of AQUACEL. U.S. ConvaTec sales increased 8% to $371 million in 2007 from 2006, primarily due to Flexi-Seal and continued growth of the AQUACEL brand. In 2006, U.S. ConvaTec sales increased 10% to $343 million from 2005, primarily due to Flexi-Seal and continued growth of the AQUACEL brand. 55 Table of Contents Geographic Areas In general, the Company products are available in most countries in the world. The largest markets are in the U.S., France, Canada, Spain, Japan, Italy, Mexico and Germany. The Company sales by geographic areas were as follows: Dollars in Millions 2007 2006 2005 % Change 2007 vs. 2006 2006 vs. 2005 United States $ 10,808 $ 9,140 $ 9,924 18% (8)% % of Total 56 % 53 % 53 % Europe, Middle East and Africa 4,635 4,518 5,111 3% (12)% % of Total 24 % 26 % 28 % Other Western Hemisphere 1,704 1,580 1,561 8% 1% % of Total 9 % 9 % 8 % Pacific 2,201 2,018 2,009 9% % of Total 11 % 12 % 11 % Total $ 19,348 $ 17,256 $ 18,605 12% (7)% Sales in the U.S. increased 18% in 2007, primarily due to increased PLAVIX* sales, the continued growth of ABILIFY*, the SUSTIVA Franchise, ERBITUX*, AVAPRO*/AVALIDE* and REYATAZ, as well as sales of newer products, BARACLUDE, ORENCIA and SPRYCEL, partially offset by increased generic competition for PRAVACHOL. In 2006, sales in the U.S. decreased 8%, primarily as a result of lower sales of PLAVIX* and the loss of exclusivity of PRAVACHOL in April 2006, partially offset by growth of the remaining pharmaceutical products, including recently launched products. Sales in Europe, Middle East and Africa increased 3%, including an 8% favorable foreign exchange impact. Excluding the impact of foreign exchange, the decrease in sales was primarily due to increased generic competition for PRAVACHOL and TAXOL (paclitaxel), partially offset by sales growth in major European markets for SPRYCEL, REYATAZ, the SUSTIVA Franchise and ABILIFY*. In 2006, sales decreased 12% as a result of sales decline of PRAVACHOL and TAXOL (paclitaxel) due to increased generic competition. This decrease in sales was partially offset by increased sales in major European markets of REYATAZ and AVAPRO*/AVALIDE*. Sales in the Other Western Hemisphere countries increased 8%, including a 4% favorable foreign exchange impact, primarily due to increased sales of PLAVIX* in Canada and Mexico, and key nutritional products and AVAPRO*/AVALIDE* in Canada, partially offset by the discontinued commercialization of TEQUIN. In 2006, sales increased 1%, including a 3% favorable foreign exchange impact. Excluding the impact of foreign exchange, the decrease in sales was primarily due to decreased sales of TEQUIN and other pharmaceutical products, partially offset by increased sales of AVAPRO*/AVALIDE* in Canada and key nutritional products. Sales in the Pacific region increased 9%, including a 5% favorable foreign exchange impact, primarily due to increased sales of BARACLUDE in China, Japan and Korea and key nutritional products, partially offset by decreased sales of TAXOL (paclitaxel) and PRAVACHOL due to increased generic competition. In 2006, sales remained consistent compared to 2005. 56 Table of Contents Expenses Dollars in Millions 2007 2006 2005 % Change 2007 vs. 2006 2006 vs. 2005 Cost of products sold $ 6,218 $ 5,739 $ 5,737 8% % of Net Sales 32.1 % 33.3 % 30.8 % Marketing, selling and administrative $ 4,855 $ 4,800 $ 4,989 1% (4)% % of Net Sales 25.1 % 27.8 % 26.8 % Advertising and product promotion $ 1,465 $ 1,340 $ 1,464 9% (8)% % of Net Sales 7.6 % 7.8 % 7.9 % Research and development $ 3,282 $ 2,991 $ 2,678 10% 12% % of Net Sales 17.0 % 17.3 % 14.4 % Acquired in-process research and development $ 230 $ $ % of Net Sales 1.2 % Provision for restructuring, net $ 183 $ 59 $ 32 ** 84% % of Net Sales 0.9 % 0.3 % 0.2 % Litigation expense, net $ 14 $ 302 $ 269 (95)% 12% % of Net Sales 0.1 % 1.8 % 1.5 % Gain on sale of product assets and businesses $ (273 ) $ (200 ) $ (569 ) (37)% 65% % of Net Sales (1.4 )% (1.2 )% (3.1 )% Equity in net income of affiliates $ (524 ) $ (474 ) $ (334 ) (11)% (42)% % of Net Sales (2.7 )% (2.7 )% (1.8 )% Other expense, net $ 364 $ 299 $ 35 22% ** % of Net Sales 1.8 % 1.7 % 0.2 % Total Expenses, net $ 15,814 $ 14,856 $ 14,301 6% 4% % of Net Sales 81.7 % 86.1 % 76.9 % ** Change is in excess of 200%. Cost of products sold, as a percentage of sales, decreased to 32.1% in 2007 compared to 2006. The margin improvement was primarily due to sales growth of higher margin products, including increased sales of PLAVIX*. In 2006 and 2005, cost of products sold, as a percentage of sales, was 33.3% and 30.8%, respectively. In 2006, the Company included $91 million, or 0.5% as a percentage of sales, of certain costs in cost of products sold, which were reported in marketing, selling and administrative expenses in the prior year results. In addition to the reclassification, the increase was primarily due to the unfavorable impact of pharmaceutical net sales mix, including lower sales of PLAVIX* and impairment charges for TEQUIN and EMSAM* related assets, as well as for a manufacturing facility. Marketing, selling and administrative expenses increased 1% to $4,855 million as compared to 2006, primarily due to an unfavorable impact of foreign exchange and higher marketing expenses, partially offset by lower sales force expenses. In 2006, marketing, selling and administrative expenses decreased 4% to $4,800 million from $4,989 million in 2005, primarily due to above-mentioned reclassification, lower sales force expenses resulting from the previously announced restructuring of the U.S. primary care sales organization that became effective in March 2006 and lower expenses for PRAVACHOL, partially offset by the impact of the adoption of stock option expensing. Marketing, selling and administrative expenses as a percentage of sales were 25.1%, compared with 27.8%, which included a 0.5% decrease from the reclassification, and 26.8% in 2006 and 2005, respectively. Advertising and product promotion expenditures increased 9% to $1,465 million as compared to 2006, primarily driven by increased spending for direct-to-customer advertising for PLAVIX*, ABILIFY* and ORENCIA, investments to support the launch of IXEMPRA, higher spending on newer products in Europe and an unfavorable impact of foreign exchange in 2007. In 2006, advertising and product promotion expenditures decreased 8% to $1,340 million compared to $1,464 million in 2005, primarily driven by the divestiture of the Consumer Medicines business in 2005 and lower spending on mature brands, partially offset by increased investments in new products including ORENCIA and SPRYCEL. The Company investment in research and development was $3,282 million in 2007, an increase of 10% over 2006. In 2006, the investment in research and development was $2,991 million, which represented a 12% increase over $2,678 million in 2005. The increases in both 2007 and 2006 reflect the Company strategy with continued investments in late-stage compounds and developing a pipeline in disease areas that address significant unmet medical need. The 2007 increase was partially offset by sharing of codevelopment costs with alliance partners AstraZeneca and Pfizer. Research and development costs also included 57 Table of Contents charges of $162 million in 2007 for upfront and milestone payments to Exelixis, Pfizer, Adnexus and Isis. Research and development costs also included charges of $85 million and $72 million in 2006 and 2005, respectively, consisting primarily of upfront and milestone payments to Exelixis and Solvay Global in 2006 and Medarex and Pierre Fabre in 2005. Research and development spending dedicated to pharmaceutical products was 20.0% of pharmaceutical sales in 2007, compared to 20.2% and 16.5% in 2006 and 2005, respectively. Acquired in-process research and development charge of $230 million in 2007 was in connection with the purchase of Adnexus in the fourth quarter of 2007. For additional information on the acquisition, see Item 8. Financial Statements Note 4. Acquisitions and Divestitures. Restructuring programs in 2007, including those under the PTI, which began in late 2007, as well as those in 2006 and 2005, have been implemented to realign and streamline operations in order to increase productivity, reduce operating expenses and to rationalize the Company manufacturing network, research facilities and the sales and marketing organizations. The PTI is expected to generate approximately $1.5 billion in cost reductions and cost avoidance by 2010. For additional information on restructuring, see Item 8. Financial Statements Note 3. Restructuring and for additional information on the PTI, see Productivity Transformation Initiative above. Litigation expense, net of settlement income and insurance recoveries, was $14 million in 2007, $302 million in 2006 and $269 million in 2005. The $14 million expense in 2007 was related to reserves recorded for the proposed settlement of certain pharmaceutical pricing and sales litigations. The $302 million net expense in 2006 consisted of an increase to the reserves of $353 million for the settlement in principle of certain pricing and sales investigations, partially offset by insurance recoveries of $37 million from an unrelated matter and $14 million in income from a settlement of a litigation matter. The $269 million net expense in 2005 consisted of increases to the reserves of $590 million for liabilities, primarily related to private litigations and governmental investigations, partially offset by insurance recoveries of $321 million. For additional information on litigation, see Item 8. Financial Statements Note 22. Legal Proceedings and Contingencies. The gain on sale of product assets of $273 million ($161 million net of tax) in 2007 was for the sale of the BUFFERIN* and EXCEDRIN* brands in Japan, as well as certain assets related to dermatology products. The gain on sale of product assets of $200 million ($130 million net of tax) in 2006 was for the sale of inventory, patent and intellectual property rights related to DOVONEX*. The gain on sale of businesses of $569 million ($370 million net of tax) in 2005 was related to the sale of the Consumer Medicines business and related assets. For additional information on these transactions, see Item 8. Financial Statements Note 4. Acquisitions and Divestitures. Equity in net income of affiliates for 2007 was $524 million, compared with $474 million and $334 million in 2006 and 2005, respectively. Equity in net income of affiliates is principally related to the Company joint venture with Sanofi and investment in ImClone. In 2007, the $50 million increase in equity in net income of affiliates was primarily due to increased net income in the Sanofi joint venture, partially offset by decreased net income from the equity investment in ImClone. In 2006, the $140 million increase in equity in net income of affiliates was primarily due to increased net income in the joint venture with Sanofi and income from the equity investment in ImClone in 2006 compared to a loss in 2005. For additional information on equity in net income of affiliates, see Item 8. Financial Statements Note 2. Alliances and Investments. Other expense, net, was $364 million, $299 million and $35 million in 2007, 2006 and 2005, respectively. Other expense, net includes net interest expense, foreign exchange gains and losses, income from third-party contract manufacturing, royalty income and expense, debt retirement costs, impairment of marketable securities, gains and losses on disposal of property, plant and equipment, gains and losses on sale of marketable securities, insurance recoveries, deferred income recognized and certain other litigation matters. The $65 million increase in other expense, net in 2007 from 2006 was primarily due to an impairment charge of $275 million on the Company investment in ARS and net unfavorability in foreign exchange in 2007, partially offset by lower net interest expense in 2007 and debt retirement costs incurred in 2006. The $264 million increase in other expense, net in 2006 from 2005 was primarily due to higher debt retirement costs in connection with the repurchase in 2006 of the $2.5 billion Notes due 2011 compared to the repurchase in 2005 of the $2.5 billion Notes due 2006, as well as $143 million of non-recurring income in 2005 resulting from the termination of the muraglitazar collaborative agreement, partially offset by lower net foreign exchange losses. For additional information, see Item 8. Financial Statements Note 7. Other Expense, Net , Note 9. Cash, Cash Equivalents and Marketable Securities and Note 15. Short-Term Borrowing and Long-Term Debt. Stock-based compensation expense recognized under SFAS No. 123 (revised 2004), Share-Based Payment (SFAS No. 123(R)) for the years ended December 31, 2007 and 2006 was $133 million and $112 million, respectively. These expenses were recorded in cost of product sold; marketing, selling and administrative expenses and research and development expenses. Stock-based compensation expense recognized under Accounting Principles Board (APB) No. 25 for the year ended December 31, 2005 was $31 million. These expenses were recorded in marketing, selling and administrative expenses. 58 Table of Contents During the years ended December 31, 2007, 2006 and 2005, the Company recorded several expense/(income) items that affected the comparability of results of the periods presented herein, which are set forth in the following table.

The increase was primarily driven by increased PLAVIX* sales, strong sales growth of other key products, improved gross margins and an increase in equity in net income of affiliates, partially offset by the net impact of items that affect the comparability of results as discussed above, investment in advertising, product promotion, and research and development. In 2006, earnings from continuing operations before minority interest and income taxes decreased 44% to $2,400 million from $4,304 million in 2005. The decrease was primarily driven by the net impact of items that affected the comparability of results as discussed above, lower net sales for pharmaceutical products resulting from lower PLAVIX* net sales and loss of exclusivity of PRAVACHOL, and increased spending on research and development, partially offset by an increase in equity in net income of affiliates and lower advertising and promotion expenses. Pharmaceuticals Earnings from continuing operations before minority interest and income taxes increased 35% to $3,471 million in 2007 from 2006. The increase in 2007 from 2006 was primarily due to increased PLAVIX* sales, strong sales growth of other key products, improved gross margins and an increase in equity in net income of affiliates, partially offset by acquired in-process research and development charge, continued investment in research and development, including upfront and milestone payments, and investment in advertising and product promotion. Earnings from continuing operations before minority interest and income taxes decreased 31% to $2,569 million in 2006 from $3,739 million in 2005, primarily due to lower net sales as a result of lower PLAVIX* sales and loss of exclusivity of PRAVACHOL, investment in research and development and continued investment in key products and new products. 60 Table of Contents Nutritionals Earnings from continuing operations before minority interest and income taxes increased 2% to $708 million in 2007 from 2006, primarily due to growth of key products, partially offset by lower gross margins, primarily due to higher dairy costs, increased investment in advertising and product promotion and the establishment of an allowance for a doubtful account in 2007. Earnings from continuing operations before minority interest and income taxes increased 3% to $696 million in 2006 from $677 million in 2005, primarily due to sales growth of children nutritional products, partially offset by increased investments in advertising expense and research and development programs. ConvaTec Earnings from continuing operations before minority interest and income taxes increased 10% to $348 million in 2007 from 2006, primarily due to increased growth of key products and improved gross margins, partially offset by increased investment in research and development programs and in product promotion. Earnings from continuing operations before minority interest and income taxes increased 9% to $315 million in 2006 from $288 million in 2005, primarily driven by increased sales. Corporate/Other Loss from continuing operations before minority interest and income taxes decreased to $993 million in 2007 from 2006. The 2007 and 2006 results included gains on sale of product assets of $273 million and $200 million, respectively. The additional difference was primarily due to debt retirement costs and increases in reserves for a pricing and sales litigation settlement, both in 2006, and lower net interest expense in 2007, partially offset by impairments of certain ARS and other properties, and higher restructuring charges. Loss from continuing operations before minority interest and income taxes increased to $1,180 million in 2006 from $400 million in 2005, primarily due to lower gain on sale of a product asset in 2006 compared to the gain on sale for Consumer Medicines business in 2005, higher debt retirement costs in 2006 compared to 2005, and a $143 million income item in 2005 resulting from the termination of the muraglitazar collaborative agreement, as well as lower insurance recoveries in 2006 as compared to 2005, partially offset by lower litigation charges in 2006 compared to 2005. Income Taxes The effective income tax rate on earnings from continuing operations before minority interest and income taxes was 22.7% in 2007 compared with 22.4% in 2006 and 20.2% in 2005. The 2007 tax rate was unfavorably impacted by the impairment on the Company investment in certain ARS with no tax benefit and the non-deductible write-off of acquired in-process research and development expenses related to the acquisition of Adnexus, partially offset by a tax benefit of $105 million in the first quarter of 2007 due to the favorable resolution of certain tax matters with the U.S. Internal Revenues Service (IRS) related to the deductibility of litigation settlement expenses and the impact of foreign tax credits. The effective tax rate for 2006 was unfavorably impacted by the elimination of tax benefits under Section 936 of the Internal Revenue Code, the treatment of provisions for a portion of certain litigation reserves as non-deductible, partially offset by favorable U.S. tax legislation enacted in 2006 related to the tax treatment of certain intercompany transactions amongst the Company foreign subsidiaries, and the implementation of tax planning strategies related to the utilization of certain charitable contributions. The increase in the 2006 effective tax rate from 2005 was primarily due to the aforementioned Section 936 benefit elimination, the treatment of provisions for a portion of certain litigation reserves as non-deductible, tax benefits in 2005 associated with the settlement of an IRS examination and a favorable adjustment in 2005 to taxes on special dividends under the American Jobs Creation Act of 2004, partially offset by favorable U.S. tax legislation enacted in 2006 related to the tax treatment of certain intercompany transactions amongst the Company foreign subsidiaries, and the implementation of tax planning strategies in 2006 related to the utilization of certain charitable contributions. The Company has recorded significant deferred tax assets at December 31, 2007 related to U.S. foreign tax credit carryforwards of approximately $1,140 million, U.S. research tax credit carryforwards of approximately $275 million and charitable contribution carryforwards of $80 million. The charitable contribution carryforwards expire in varying amounts beginning in 2009, while the foreign tax credit and research tax credit carryforwards expire in varying amounts beginning in 2012. The foreign tax credit and research tax credit have been reduced due to derecognition under FIN No. 48. Realization of these credits and the charitable contribution carryforwards is dependent on generating sufficient domestic taxable income prior to their expiration. Although realization is not assured, management believes it is more likely than not that these deferred tax assets will be realized. The Company anticipates increasing its level of domestic profitability over time by undertaking actions such as its PTI, increasing its biologics manufacturing capacity in the U.S. and implementing tax planning strategies. While increasing domestic profitability will likely cause the Company effective tax rate to increase, it will also further enhance the Company ability to utilize its foreign tax credit, research tax credit and charitable contribution carryforwards. 61 Table of Contents Minority Interest Minority interest, net of taxes increased to $763 million in 2007 from 2006, primarily due to higher earnings in the Company partnership with Sanofi for the territory covering the Americas. In 2006, minority interest, net of taxes decreased to $440 million from $592 million in 2005, primarily due to lower earnings in the Company partnership with Sanofi for the territory covering the Americas. The changes in the three years reflect the negative impact of generic clopidogrel bisulfate from August 2006 to mid-2007. Discontinued Operations In December 2007, the Company entered into a definitive agreement with Avista for the sale of its Medical Imaging business for a purchase price of approximately $525 million in cash, subject to customary post-closing adjustments. The closing of the transaction was completed on January 7, 2008. As a result of this transaction, the Company expects to recognize a pre-tax gain of approximately $20 million to $40 million ($30 million to $50 million loss net of tax) in the first quarter of 2008, subject to the post-closing adjustments. Medical Imaging was previously included in the former Other Health Care operating segment. In May 2005, the Company completed the sale of OTN to One Equity Partners LLC for cash proceeds of $197 million, including the impact of a preliminary working capital adjustment. The Company recorded a pre-tax gain of $63 million ($13 million net of tax), that was presented as a gain on sale of discontinued operations in the consolidated statement of earnings. OTN was previously presented as a separate segment. The following summarized financial information related to the Medical Imaging and OTN businesses have been segregated from continuing operations and reported as discontinued operations through the date of disposition and do not reflect the costs of certain services provided to Medical Imaging and OTN. Such costs, which were not allocated by the Company to Medical Imaging and OTN, were for services, which included legal counsel, insurance, external audit fees, payroll processing, certain human resource services and information technology systems support. Year ended December 31, Dollars in Millions 2007 2006 2005 Net sales $ 629 $ 658 $ 1,617 Earnings/(loss) before incomes taxes $ 273 $ 235 $ 204 Provision for income taxes 76 72 59 Net earnings/(loss) from discontinued operations $ 197 $ 163 $ 145 Financial Position, Liquidity and Capital Resources Cash, cash equivalents and marketable securities were approximately $2.2 billion at December 31, 2007, compared to $4.0 billion at December 31, 2006. The Company continues to maintain a sufficient level of working capital, which was approximately $1.7 billion at December 31, 2007, decreasing from $3.8 billion at December 31, 2006. In 2008 and future periods, the Company expects cash generated by its U.S. operations, together with existing cash, cash equivalents, marketable securities and borrowings from the capital markets, to be sufficient to cover cash needs for working capital, capital expenditures (which the Company expects to include substantial investments in facilities to increase and maintain the Company capacity to provide biologics on a commercial scale), milestone payments and dividends paid in the U.S. Cash and cash equivalents, marketable securities, the conversion of other working-capital items and borrowings are expected to fund near-term operations outside the U.S. As of December 31, 2007, the Company had approximately $14.1 billion of undistributed earnings of foreign subsidiaries for which taxes have not been provided as the Company has invested or expects to invest these undistributed earnings permanently offshore. If, in the future, these earnings are repatriated to the U.S., or if the Company determines such earnings will be remitted in the foreseeable future, additional tax provisions would be required. Due to complexities in the tax laws and the assumptions that would have to be made, it is not practicable to estimate the amounts of income taxes that would have to be provided. Cash and cash equivalents at December 31, 2007 and 2006 primarily consisted of bank deposits, time deposits and money market funds. Cash equivalents are primarily highly liquid investments with original maturities of three months or less at the time of purchase and are recorded at cost, which approximates fair value. The Company maintains cash and cash equivalent balances in U.S. dollars and foreign currencies which are subject to currency rate risk. In January 2008, the Company converted a substantial portion of its cash equivalents from money market funds to U.S. Treasury bills and similar investments. Marketable securities at December 31, 2007 consisted of U.S. dollar-denominated floating rate securities (FRS), which are primarily AAA/Aaa rated. FRS are long-term debt securities with coupons that are reset periodically against a benchmark interest rate. The underlying assets of the Company FRS consist of primarily investment grade corporate bonds and loans. The carrying value of FRS was reduced by $25 million, from $362 million to $337 million at December 31, 2007, reflecting the change in fair market value. The Company assessed this decline in fair market value to be temporary, and recorded a pre-tax $25 million reduction ($16 million net of tax) in shareholders equity in accumulated other comprehensive income (OCI). 62 Table of Contents As previously disclosed, in September 2006, the Company and Sanofi each posted $200 million towards a $400 million bond with the U.S. District Court for the Southern District of New York (District court) as collateral in support of the preliminary injunction issued on August 31, 2006. This collateral was reported as marketable securities on the Company consolidated balance sheet at December 31, 2006. As a result of the outcome of the PLAVIX* patent litigation noted above, on June 21, 2007, the District court ordered release of the $400 million bond and release of the issuer of the bond from any liability in connection with the bond. As such, the Company obligations under the collateral arrangements with respect to the bond were effectively terminated. In addition, at December 31, 2007, the Company had $811 million of principal invested in ARS. The ARS held by the Company are private placement securities with long-term nominal maturities for which the interest rates are reset through a dutch auction each month. The monthly auctions historically have provided a liquid market for these securities. The Company investments in ARS represent interests in collateralized debt obligations supported by pools of residential and commercial mortgages or credit cards, insurance securitizations and other structured credits, including corporate bonds. Some of the underlying collateral for the ARS held by the Company consists of sub-prime mortgages. Consistent with the Company investment policy guidelines, the ARS investments held by the Company all had AAA/Aaa credit ratings at the time of purchase. With the liquidity issues experienced in global credit and capital markets, the ARS held by the Company at December 31, 2007 have experienced multiple failed auctions as the amount of securities submitted for sale has exceeded the amount of purchase orders. In addition, in the fourth quarter of 2007, $79 million of principal invested in ARS held by the Company were downgraded and others were placed on credit watch. All of these securities retained at least one AAA rating as of December 31, 2007. The estimated market value of the Company ARS holdings at December 31, 2007 was $419 million, which reflects a $392 million adjustment to the principal value of $811 million. Although the ARS continue to pay interest according to their stated terms, based on valuation models and an analysis of other-than-temporary impairment factors, the Company has recorded a pre-tax impairment charge of $275 million in the fourth quarter of 2007, reflecting the portion of ARS holdings that the Company has concluded have an other-than-temporary decline in value. In addition, the Company recorded an unrealized loss of $117 million (pre-tax and net of tax) in accumulated OCI as a reduction in shareholders equity, reflecting adjustments to ARS holdings that the Company has concluded have a temporary decline in value. The $275 million impairment charge does not have a material impact on the Company liquidity or financial flexibility. Historically, given the liquidity created by the auctions, ARS were presented as current assets under marketable securities. Given the failed auctions, the Company ARS are illiquid until there is a successful auction for them. Accordingly, the entire amount of such remaining ARS has been reclassified from marketable securities to non-current other assets. The credit and capital markets have continued to deteriorate in 2008. If uncertainties in these credit and capital markets continue, these markets deteriorate further or the Company experiences any additional ratings downgrades on any investments in its portfolio (including on ARS), the Company may incur additional impairments to its investment portfolio, which could negatively affect the Company financial condition, cash flow and reported earnings. The Company believes that based on the Company current cash, cash equivalents and marketable securities balances of $2.2 billion at December 31, 2007 and expected operating cash flows, the current lack of liquidity in the credit and capital markets will not have a material impact on the Company liquidity, cash flow, financial flexibility or its ability to fund its operations, including the dividend. On February 21, 2008, the Company completed the sale and leaseback of an administrative facility in Paris, France, for approximately 155 million. The Company expects to record a gain, of which the majority will be deferred and will reduce future lease rental costs over the lease period. In December 2006, the Company completed the sale and leaseback of several administrative facilities in New Jersey for $283 million, which resulted in a pre-tax gain from the transaction of $154 million, of which $145 million was deferred and will reduce future lease rental costs over the lease periods ranging from 8 to 12 years. Short-term borrowings at the end of 2007 and 2006 were $1.9 billion and $187 million, respectively. The Company maintains cash balances and short-term investments in excess of short-term borrowings. The $108 million of 1.10% Yen Notes, due 2008; the $31 million of 1.43% Yen Notes, due 2008; the $400 million of 4.00% Notes, due 2008, and associated unamortized discount and interest rate swap valuation; and the $1.2 billion of Floating Rate Convertible Debentures, due 2023 (with a 2008 put/call), were reclassified from long-term debt to short-term borrowings in 2007. Long-term debt was $4.4 billion at December 31, 2007 compared to $7.2 billion at December 31, 2006. The $2.8 billion reduction was primarily due to the reclassification to short-term borrowings noted above and the September 2007 repayment of the remaining $1.3 billion balance of the Floating Rate Bank Term Facility, due 2010. During the fourth quarter of 2006, the Company restructured its long-term debt by retiring all of its outstanding $2.5 billion principal amount of 5.75% Notes due 2011 through a cash tender offer and subsequent redemption and issuing 500 million aggregate principal of 4.375% Notes due 2016, 500 million aggregate principal of 4.625% Notes due 2021, as well as $1.25 billion aggregate principal of 5.875% Notes due 2036. The Company incurred an aggregate pre-tax expense of approximately $220 million in 63 Table of Contents connection with the early redemption of the 2011 Notes and termination of related interest rate swaps, which included the write-off of the related unamortized discount, issuance costs and deferred loss on an interest rate lock. In addition, the Company repaid $1.2 billion of its $2.5 billion Floating Rate Bank Term Facility, due 2010. In December 2006, the Company replaced its prior $2 billion revolving credit facility with a new $2 billion five-year revolving credit facility from a syndicate of lenders, which is extendable on the anniversary date with the consent of the lenders. This facility contains customary terms and conditions substantially similar to the prior facility, including a financial covenant whereby the ratio of consolidated debt to consolidated capital cannot exceed 50% at the end of each quarter. The Company has been in compliance with this covenant since the inception of this facility. There were no borrowings outstanding under the revolving credit facility at December 31, 2007. During the second quarter of 2005, the Company repurchased all of its outstanding $2.5 billion aggregate principal amount 4.75% Notes due 2006, and incurred an aggregate pre-tax loss of approximately $69 million in connection with the early redemption of the Notes and termination of related interest rate swaps. A majority of the Company debt is fixed rate. The Company, however, has entered into fixed to floating interest rate swaps for $2.6 billion and 1 billion ($1.5 billion at December 31, 2007) of its long-term debt. Pre-tax interest expense, net of interest swap gains, was $422 million, $498 million and $349 million, in 2007, 2006 and 2005, respectively. The decrease in interest expense in 2007 from 2006 was primarily due to the effects of the 2006 debt restructuring, and the increase in interest expense in 2006 from 2005 was primarily due to higher interest rates. The Moody Investors Service (Moody s) long-term and short-term credit ratings for the Company are currently A2 and Prime-1, respectively. Moody long-term credit rating remains on stable outlook. Standard & Poor (S&P) long-term and short-term credit ratings for the Company are currently A+ and A-1, respectively. In the second quarter of 2007, S&P revised its long-term credit rating outlook to stable from negative. Fitch Ratings (Fitch) long-term and short-term credit ratings for the Company are currently A+ and F1, respectively. In the third quarter of 2007, Fitch revised its long-term credit rating outlook to stable from negative. Working capital for the years ended December 31, 2007 and 2006 were as follows: December 31, Dollars in Millions 2007 2006 Working capital $ 1,704 $ 3,806 The decrease in working capital of $2.1 billion from December 31, 2006 to December 31, 2007 was impacted by: Decrease in marketable securities due to a reduction to the carrying value of floating rate securities and certain other ARS to fair market value and the subsequent reclassifications of the remaining value of ARS to other non-current assets. Increase in short-term borrowings from long-term debt due to the reclassifications as noted above. Increase in accrued royalties resulting from increased PLAVIX* sales. Increase in receivables primarily due to increased PLAVIX* sales in the U.S. Reclassification of Medical Imaging and other assets and liabilities to held for sale in 2007. Reclassification of certain tax contingencies from current U.S. and foreign income taxes payable to non-current upon the adoption of FIN No. 48 on January 1, 2007. The following discussions of the Company cash flow activities include discontinued operations. The Company cash flow activities for the years ended December 31, 2007, 2006 and 2005 were as follows: Year Ended December 31, Dollars in Millions 2007 2006 2005 Cash flow provided by/(used in): Operating activities $ 3,153 $ 2,083 $ 1,836 Investing activities (202 ) 206 1,191 Financing activities (3,213 ) (3,351 ) (3,637 ) Net cash provided by operating activities was $3.2 billion in 2007 and $2.1 billion in 2006. The $1,070 million increase in 2007 compared to 2006 is attributable to higher net earnings of $580 million, higher net changes in adjustments to net earnings of $8 million and higher net changes in operating assets and liabilities of $482 million. 64 Table of Contents Net positive changes in adjustments to net earnings in 2007 compared to 2006, of $8 million, mainly included: A $288 million negative cash flow variance due to lower litigation settlement expenses in 2007. A $259 million positive cash flow variance resulting from impairment charges and asset write-offs mainly from the reduction of the carrying value of ARS to fair value and from the impending closure of manufacturing facilities. A $230 positive cash flow variance for acquired in-process research and development related to the acquisition of Adnexus in 2007. A $180 million negative cash flow variance in deferred income tax benefit. The 2007 adjustments included the deferred tax benefits from the restructuring of the Company international operations, upfront cash receipts from alliance partners and the resolution of an audit issue with the IRS, partially offset by litigation payments. The 2006 adjustments included a net deferred tax charge for the payment of litigation settlements offset by the deferred tax benefit on additional litigation accruals, the accrual of additional foreign tax credits and the deferred tax benefit on equity-based compensation. A $124 million positive cash flow variance due to higher provision for restructuring in 2007 in connection with the PTI. Net positive changes in operating assets and liabilities in 2007 compared to 2006, of $482 million, mainly included: A $966 million positive cash flow variance from accounts payable and accrued expenses is primarily due to an increase in accrued royalties in 2007 resulting from increased PLAVIX* sales, higher purchases of raw materials, a significant paydown of payables in early 2006 resulting from lower payment of invoices in December 2005 and a reduction of accrued rebates and returns in the first quarter of 2006, primarily resulting from lower sales volume. A $671 million negative cash flow variance from receivables, primarily due to increased PLAVIX* sales in 2007 and lower collection in 2007 resulting from lower PRAVACHOL sales. A $368 million positive cash flow variance in deferred income and other liabilities, mainly due to upfront cash receipts from alliance partners in 2007. A $132 million negative cash flow variance from inventories, primarily due to an increase in inventories in 2007 in anticipation of new product launches and strategic builds for existing products, and the reduction in inventories in 2006 resulting from PRAVACHOL exclusivity loss. A $108 million negative cash flow variance from income taxes payable, primarily related to payments to settle various tax issues for the 2002-2003 IRS audit. Net cash used in investing activities was $202 million in 2007 and net cash provided by investing activities was $206 million in 2006. The $408 million negative cash flow variance is primarily attributable to: A $432 million negative cash flow variance from the acquisition of Adnexus. A $281 million negative cash flow variance for proceeds from the disposal of properties in connection with a sales and leaseback transaction in 2006. A $280 million positive cash flow variance from licensing milestone payments in 2006 to ImClone and Somerset Pharmaceuticals, Inc. Net cash used in financing activities was $3,213 million in 2007 and $3,351 million in 2006. The $138 million positive cash flow variance is mainly attributable to: A $163 million positive cash flow variance mainly from higher cash proceeds from the exercise of stock options in 2007 compared to 2006. Net cash provided by operating activities was $2.1 billion in 2006 and $1.8 billion in 2005. The $247 million increase in 2006 compared to 2005 is mainly attributable to significant changes in adjustments to net earnings of $1,398 million and net changes in operating assets and liabilities of $264 million, offset by lower net earnings of $1,415 million. Significant positive changes in adjustments to net earnings in 2006 compared to 2005, of $1,398 million, mainly included: A $576 million positive cash flow variance in deferred income tax benefit, due to a lower level of increase in deferred tax benefit in 2006 compared to 2005. In 2006, there was an increase in deferred tax benefits associated with U.S. research and development, foreign tax credits and an increase in litigation reserves. In 2005, there was an increase in deferred tax benefits associated with the reversal of the tax liability related to the repatriation of special dividends under the AJCA. A $425 million positive cash flow variance, due to lower gain on sale of a product asset in 2006 as compared to sale of a business in 2005. A $143 million positive cash flow variance for deferred income recognized related to the termination of the muraglitazar collaborative agreement in 2005. 65 Table of Contents Net positive changes in operating assets and liabilities in 2006 compared to 2005, of $264 million, mainly included: A $329 million negative cash flow variance from receivables. In 2006, the increase in cash flow was driven by increases in receivables, due from alliance partners, which were partially offset by lower trade receivable volume. In 2005, the increase in cash flow is driven by the collection of foreign withholding taxes and from alliance partners. A $448 million positive cash flow variance from inventories, primarily due to an increase in inventories in 2005 resulting from the growth of newer products and in anticipation of new product launches, and the reduction in inventories in 2006 resulting from PRAVACHOL exclusivity loss. A $283 million negative cash flow variance in litigation, primarily due to settlement payments of $339 million in 2006 for the DPA and the Vanlev litigation, which were partially offset by unrelated insurance recoveries of $67 million. A $443 million positive cash flow variance from income taxes payable, primarily related to payments in 2005 for the settlement of examinations by the IRS for years 1998 through 2001 and the repatriation of special dividends under AJCA. Net cash provided by investing activities was $206 million in 2006 compared to net cash provided of $1,191 million in 2005. The $985 million negative cash flow variance is primarily attributable to: A $281 million negative cash flow variance mainly from the sale of marketable securities in 2005. A $617 million negative cash flow variance from lower proceeds for the sale of a product asset in 2006 compared to the sale of the Consumer Medicines and OTN businesses in 2005. A $280 million negative cash flow variance from milestone payments in 2006, primarily related to ImClone. A $281 million positive cash flow variance for proceeds from the disposal of properties in connection with a sale and leaseback transaction in 2006. Net cash used in financing activities was $3,351 million in 2006 compared to $3,637 million in 2005. The $286 million positive cash flow variance was mainly attributable to: A $1,655 million positive cash flow variance from the repayment of short-term borrowings in 2005. A $1,198 negative cash flow variance from the retirement of long-term debt. In 2006, the Company repaid debt of $1,200 million and retired the 5.75% Notes due 2011 for $2,425 million. In 2005, the Company retired the 4.75% Notes due 2006 for $2,507 million. Cash provided from operations and borrowings was primarily used over the past three years to pay dividends of approximately $6.6 billion. The Company has also invested approximately $2.4 billion over the past three years in capital expansion to improve plant efficiency and maintain superior research facilities. Over the past three years, the Company did not repurchase any of its common stock. The share repurchase program authorizes the Company to purchase common stock from time to time in the open market or through private transactions as market conditions permit. This program is intended to reduce the increase in shares outstanding from option exercises and to obtain shares for general corporate purposes. Dividends declared per common share were $1.15 for 2007 and $1.12 for each of 2006 and 2005. In December 2007, the Company declared a quarterly dividend of $.31 per common share and indicated a dividend for the full year 2008 of $1.24 per share. Dividend decisions are made on a quarterly basis by the Company Board of Directors. The Company financial condition and liquidity could be affected by obligations to make milestone or other one-time payments, by the outcome of pending litigations and investigations, including the challenge to the PLAVIX* patent and/or the potential for renewed or additional generic competition for PLAVIX*, and by additional impairments to its investment portfolio.

Legal Proceedings and Contingencies. 66 Table of Contents Contractual Obligations Payments due by period for the Company contractual obligations at December 31, 2007 were as follows: Obligations Expiring by Period Dollars in Millions Total 2008 2009 2010 2011 2012 Later Years Short-term borrowings $ 1,891 $ 1,891 $ $ $ $ $ Long-term debt (1) 4,381 9 31 4,341 Operating leases 704 143 116 90 72 71 212 Purchase obligations 3,415 830 514 488 471 434 678 Stand-by letters of credit/performance guarantees 236 175 45 10 3 1 2 Uncertain tax positions (2) 195 195 Pension and other liabilities 1,253 126 173 117 113 111 613 Total $ 12,075 $ 3,360 $ 857 $ 736 $ 659 $ 617 $ 5,846 (1) The current portion of long-term debt obligations is included in short-term borrowings on the Company consolidated balance sheet at December 31, 2007 and all balances approximate the outstanding nominal long-term debt values. The contractual obligations table above excludes interest payment obligations. The Company convertible debenture is included as due for payment in 2008, as it contains a 2008 put and call feature. (2) Due to the uncertainty related to the timing of the reversal of uncertain tax positions, only the short-term uncertain tax benefits have been provided in the table above. The long-term amounts excluded from the table above total $537 million. In addition to the above, the Company has committed to make potential future milestone payments to third parties as part of in-licensing and development programs. Payments under these agreements generally become due and payable only upon achievement of certain developmental, regulatory and/or commercial milestones, for which the specific timing cannot be predicted. Because the achievement of these milestones is neither probable nor reasonably estimable, such contingencies have not been recorded on the Company consolidated balance sheet.

Pension and Other Postretirement Benefit Plans. SEC Consent Order As previously disclosed, on August 4, 2004, the Company entered into a final settlement with the SEC, concluding an investigation concerning certain wholesaler inventory and accounting matters. The settlement was reached through a Consent, a copy of which was attached as Exhibit 10 to the Company quarterly report on Form 10-Q for the period ended September 30, 2004. Under the terms of the Consent, the Company agreed, subject to certain defined exceptions, to limit sales of all products sold to its direct customers (including wholesalers, distributors, hospitals, retail outlets, pharmacies and government purchasers) based on expected demand or on amounts that do not exceed approximately one month of inventory on hand, without making a timely public disclosure of any change in practice. The Company also agreed in the Consent to certain measures that it has implemented including: (a) establishing a formal review and certification process of its annual and quarterly reports filed with the SEC; (b) establishing a business risk and disclosure group; (c) retaining an outside consultant to comprehensively study and help re-engineer the Company accounting and financial reporting processes; (d) publicly disclosing any sales incentives offered to direct customers for the purpose of inducing them to purchase products in excess of expected demand; and (e) ensuring that the Company budget process gives appropriate weight to inputs that come from the bottom to the top, and not just those that come from the top to the bottom, and adequately documenting that process. The Company has established a company-wide policy to limit its sales to direct customers for the purpose of complying with the Consent. This policy includes the adoption of various procedures to monitor and limit sales to direct customers in accordance with the terms of the Consent. These procedures include a governance process to escalate to appropriate management levels potential questions or concerns regarding compliance with the policy and timely resolution of such questions or concerns. In addition, compliance with the policy is monitored on a regular basis. The Company maintains IMAs with most of its U.S. pharmaceutical wholesalers that account for nearly 100% of total gross sales of U.S. pharmaceutical products. Under the current terms of the IMAs, the Company three largest wholesaler customers provide the Company with weekly information with respect to months on hand product-level inventories and the amount of out-movement of products. These three wholesalers currently account for approximately 90% of total gross sales of U.S. Pharmaceuticals products in 2007, 2006 and 2005. The inventory information received from these wholesalers, together with the Company internal information, is used to estimate months on hand product level inventories at these wholesalers. The Company estimates months on hand product inventory levels for its U.S. Pharmaceutical business wholesaler customers other than the three largest wholesalers by extrapolating from the months on hand calculated for the three largest wholesalers. In contrast, for the Company Pharmaceutical business outside of the U.S., Nutritionals and ConvaTec business units around the world, the Company has significantly more direct customers, limited information on direct customer product level inventory and corresponding out-movement information and the reliability of third-party demand information, where available, varies widely. Accordingly, the Company relies on a variety of methods to estimate months on hand product level inventories for these business units. 67 Table of Contents The Company believes the above-described procedures provide a reasonable basis to ensure compliance with the Consent. As previously disclosed, on June 15, 2005, the Company entered into a DPA with the U.S. Attorney Office for the District of New Jersey resolving the investigation by the USAO of the Company relating to wholesaler inventory and various accounting matters covered by the Company settlement with the SEC. Pursuant to the DPA, the USAO filed a criminal complaint against the Company alleging conspiracy to commit securities fraud, but agreed to defer prosecution of the Company and dismiss the complaint after two years if the Company satisfied all of the requirements of the DPA. A copy of the DPA was filed as Exhibit 99.2 to a Form 8-K filed by the Company on June 16, 2005 and is incorporated by reference hereto as Exhibit 10w to the Form 10-K for the fiscal year ended December 31, 2006. Under the terms of the DPA, the Company agreed to retain a Monitor. The Monitor had defined powers and responsibilities under the DPA, including to oversee the Company compliance with all of the terms of the DPA, the Consent and the settlements of the derivative action and the Federal securities class action. These powers and responsibilities of the Monitor ended on April 12, 2007. The Monitor filed a final report with the USAO on June 8, 2007. On June 15, 2007 the DPA expired and the complaint has been dismissed. The Company has no on-going obligations under the DPA. Recently Issued Accounting Standards At its December 2007 meeting, the Financial Accounting Standards Board (FASB) ratified the consensus reached by the Emerging Issues Task Force (EITF) in Issue No. 07-1, Accounting for Collaborative Arrangements Related to the Development and Commercialization of Intellectual Property . The EITF concluded that a collaborative arrangement is one in which the participants are actively involved and are exposed to significant risks and rewards that depend on the ultimate commercial success of the endeavor. Revenues and costs incurred with third parties in connection with collaborative arrangements would be presented gross or net based on the criteria in EITF 99-19, Reporting Revenue Gross as a Principal versus Net as an Agent , and other accounting literature. Payments to or from collaborators would be evaluated and presented based on the nature of the arrangement and its terms, the nature of the entity business and whether those payments are within the scope of other accounting literature. The nature and purpose of collaborative arrangements are to be disclosed along with the accounting policies and the classification and amounts of significant financial statement amounts related to the arrangements. Activities in the arrangement conducted in a separate legal entity should be accounted for under other accounting literature; however, required disclosure under EITF 07-1 applies to the entire collaborative agreement. This Issue is effective for fiscal years beginning after December 15, 2008, and is to be applied retrospectively to all periods presented for all collaborative arrangements existing as of the effective date. The Company is currently in the process of evaluating the impact of adopting this pronouncement. In December 2007, the FASB issued SFAS No. 141(R), Business Combinations , which replaces SFAS No. 141, Business Combinations , and requires an acquirer to recognize the assets acquired, the liabilities assumed, and any non-controlling interest in the acquiree at the acquisition date, measured at their fair values as of that date, with limited exceptions. This Statement also requires the acquirer in a business combination achieved in stages to recognize the identifiable assets and liabilities, as well as the non-controlling interest in the acquiree, at the full amounts of their fair values. SFAS No. 141(R) makes various other amendments to authoritative literature intended to provide additional guidance or to confirm the guidance in that literature to that provided in this Statement. This Statement applies to business combinations for which the acquisition date is in fiscal years beginning after December 15, 2008. The Company is currently in the process of evaluating the impact of adopting this pronouncement. In December 2007, FASB issued SFAS No. 160, Noncontrolling Interests in Consolidated Financial Statements an amendment of ARB No.51 . SFAS No. 160 establishes accounting and reporting standards that require the ownership interests in subsidiaries held by parties other than the parent to be clearly identified, labeled and presented in the consolidated statement of financial position within equity, but separate from the parent equity. This Statement also requires the amount of consolidated net income attributable to the parent and to the noncontrolling interest to be clearly identified and presented on the face of the consolidated statement of income. Changes in a parent ownership interest while the parent retains its controlling financial interest in its subsidiary must be accounted for consistently, and when a subsidiary is deconsolidated, any retained noncontrolling equity investment in the former subsidiary must be initially measured at fair value. The gain or loss on the deconsolidation of the subsidiary is measured using the fair value of any noncontrolling equity investment. The Statement also requires entities to provide sufficient disclosures that clearly identify and distinguish between the interests of the parent and the interests of the noncontrolling owners. This Statement is effective for fiscal years beginning after December 15, 2008. The Company is currently in the process of evaluating the impact of adopting this pronouncement. In June 2007, the EITF reached a consensus on Issue No. 07-3, Accounting for Nonrefundable Advance Payments for Goods or Services Received to Be Used in Future Research and Development Activities . Nonrefundable advance payments for goods or services that will be used or rendered for future research and development activities should be deferred and capitalized. Such amounts should be recognized as an expense as the related goods are delivered or the services are performed, or when the goods or services are no longer expected to be provided. This Issue is effective for fiscal years beginning after December 15, 2007, and earlier application is not permitted. The pronouncement is not expected to have a material effect on the Company consolidated financial statements. 68 Table of Contents In February 2007, the FASB issued SFAS No. 159, The Fair Value Option for Financial Assets and Financial Liabilities Including an amendment of FASB Statement No. 115 , which permits an entity to measure certain financial assets and financial liabilities at fair value. The objective of SFAS No. 159 is to improve financial reporting by allowing entities to mitigate volatility in reported earnings caused by the measurement of related assets and liabilities using different attributes, without having to apply complex hedge accounting provisions. Under SFAS No. 159, entities that elect the fair value option (by instrument) will report unrealized gains and losses in earnings at each subsequent reporting date. The fair value option election is irrevocable, unless a new election date occurs. SFAS No. 159 establishes presentation and disclosure requirements to help financial statement users understand the effect of the entity election on its earnings, but does not eliminate disclosure requirements of other accounting standards. Assets and liabilities that are measured at fair value must be displayed on the face of the balance sheet. This Statement is effective for fiscal years beginning after November 15, 2007. The Company did not elect early adoption of this pronouncement as permitted. The adoption of this accounting pronouncement is not expected to have a material effect on the Company consolidated financial statements. In September 2006, the FASB issued Statement SFAS No. 158 , Employers Accounting for Defined Benefit Pension and Other Postretirement Plans an amendment of FASB Statements No. 87, 88, 106, and 132(R) . This pronouncement requires an employer to recognize the overfunded or underfunded status of a defined benefit postretirement plan (other than a multiemployer plan) as an asset or liability in its statement of financial position and to recognize changes in that funded status in the year in which the changes occur through comprehensive income of a business entity. This pronouncement also requires an employer to measure the funded status of a plan as of the date of its year-end statement of financial position, with limited exceptions. The pronouncement does not require prior periods to be restated to reflect the impact of SFAS No. 158. The Company adopted SFAS No. 158 in the fiscal year ended December 31, 2006 and the adoption of this accounting pronouncement resulted in a $1,064 million reduction of accumulated OCI in stockholders equity, a $767 million reduction in total assets and a $297 million increase in total liabilities. The adoption of SFAS No. 158 did not impact the Company results of operations or cash flows. In September 2006, the FASB issued SFAS No. 157, Fair Value Measurements. This pronouncement defines fair value, establishes a framework for measuring fair value and expands disclosures about fair value measurements. This Statement is effective for fiscal years beginning after November 15, 2007. On November 14, 2007, the FASB agreed to a one-year deferral for the implementation of SFAS No. 157 for other non-financial assets and liabilities. The adoption of this accounting pronouncement is not expected to have a material effect on the Company consolidated financial statements for financial assets and liabilities and any other assets and liabilities carried at fair value. The Company is currently in the process of evaluating the impact of adopting this pronouncement for other non-financial assets or liabilities. In September 2006, the SEC issued Staff Accounting Bulletin (SAB) No. 108, Considering the Effects of Prior Year Misstatements when Quantifying the Misstatements in Current Year Financial Statements , that expresses the staff views regarding the process of quantifying financial statement misstatements. This bulletin is effective for any interim period of the first fiscal year ending after November 15, 2006. SAB No. 108 requires that companies utilize a dual approach to assess the quantitative effects of financial statement misstatements. The dual approach includes both an income statement focus and balance sheet focus assessment. The adoption of this bulletin did not have any effect on the Company consolidated financial statements. In July 2006, the FASB issued FASB Interpretation (FIN) No. 48, Accounting for Uncertainty in Income Taxes an interpretation of FASB Statement No. 109, which, in the case of the Company, is effective as of January 1, 2007. FIN No. 48 clarifies the accounting for uncertainty in income taxes recognized in an enterprise financial statements in accordance with SFAS No. 109, Accounting for Income Taxes . FIN No. 48 requires that all tax positions be evaluated using a recognition threshold and measurement attribute for the financial statement recognition and measurement of a tax position taken or expected to be taken in a tax return. Differences between tax positions taken in a tax return and amounts recognized in the financial statements are recorded as adjustments to income taxes payable or receivable, or adjustments to deferred taxes, or both. FIN No. 48 also requires expanded disclosure at the end of each reporting period including a tabular reconciliation of unrecognized tax benefits. The Company adopted FIN No. 48 on January 1, 2007. As a result of the adoption of this accounting pronouncement, the Company recognized $27 million of previously unrecognized tax benefits, which was accounted for as an increase to the opening balance of retained earnings. In May 2007, the FASB issued FASB Staff Position (FSP) FIN No. 48-1, Definition of Settlement in FASB Interpretation No. 48 , which is effective retroactively to January 1, 2007. FSP FIN No. 48-1 provides guidance on how to determine whether a tax position is effectively settled for the purpose of recognizing previously unrecognized tax benefits. The adoption of FSP FIN No. 48-1 did not have any effect on the Company consolidated financial statements. In March 2006, the FASB issued SFAS No. 156, Accounting for Servicing of Financial Assets an amendment of FASB Statement No. 140. This pronouncement relates to the accounting for separately recognized servicing assets and servicing liabilities. This Statement is effective for fiscal years beginning after September 15, 2006. The adoption of this accounting pronouncement did not have a material effect on the Company consolidated financial statements. 69 Table of Contents In February 2006, the FASB issued SFAS No. 155, Accounting for Certain Hybrid Financial Instruments, an amendment of FASB Statements No. 133 and 140 . This pronouncement primarily resolves certain issues addressed in the implementation of SFAS No. 133, Accounting for Derivative Instruments and Hedging Activities , concerning beneficial interests in securitized financial assets. The Statement is effective for all financial instruments acquired, issued or subject to a remeasurement event occurring after the beginning of the 2007 fiscal year. The adoption of this accounting pronouncement did not have a material effect on the Company consolidated financial statements. In May 2005, the FASB issued SFAS No. 154, Accounting Changes and Error Corrections a replacement of APB Opinion No. 20 and FASB Statement No. 3 . This pronouncement applies to all voluntary changes in accounting principle, and revises the requirements for accounting for and reporting a change in accounting principle. SFAS No. 154 requires retrospective application to prior periods financial statements of a voluntary change in accounting principle, unless it is impracticable to do so. This pronouncement also requires that a change in the method of depreciation, amortization or depletion for long-lived, non-financial assets be accounted for as a change in accounting estimate that is affected by a change in accounting principle. SFAS No. 154 is effective for accounting changes and corrections of errors made in fiscal years beginning after December 15, 2005. The Statement does not change the transition provisions of any existing accounting pronouncements, including those that are in a transition phase as of the effective date of SFAS No. 154. The adoption of this accounting pronouncement did not have a material effect on the Company consolidated financial statements. In March 2005, the FASB issued FIN No. 47, Accounting for Conditional Asset Retirement Obligations an interpretation of FASB Statement No. 143 . FIN No. 47 clarifies that an entity must record a liability for a conditional asset retirement obligation if the fair value of the obligation can be reasonably estimated. Asset retirement obligations covered by FIN No. 47 are those for which an entity has a legal obligation to perform an asset retirement activity, even if the timing and method of settling the obligation are conditional on a future event that may or may not be within the control of the entity. FIN No. 47 also clarifies when an entity would have sufficient information to reasonably estimate the fair value of an asset retirement obligation. This Interpretation was effective no later than the end of fiscal years ending after December 15, 2005. The Company adopted the provisions of FIN No. 47 in the fiscal year ended December 31, 2005, and adoption of this accounting pronouncement did not have a material effect on the Company consolidated financial statements. In December 2004, the FASB issued SFAS No. 123 (revised 2004), Share-Based Payment (SFAS No. 123(R)), which requires the measurement and recognition of compensation expense for all stock-based payment awards made to employees and directors based on estimated fair values. SFAS No. 123(R) supersedes the Company previous accounting under APB No. 25, Accounting for Stock Issued to Employees , for periods beginning January 1, 2006. In March 2005, the SEC issued SAB No. 107, Share-Based Payment , relating to SFAS No. 123(R). The Company has applied the provisions of SAB No. 107 in its adoption of SFAS No. 123(R). The Company adopted SFAS No. 123(R) using the modified prospective transition method, which requires the application of the accounting standard as of January 1, 2006, and has elected the alternative method as provided in FSP 123(R)-3, Transition Election Related to Accounting for the Tax Effects of Share-Based Payment Awards , in determining the Company pool of excess tax benefits. The Company consolidated financial statements for the year ended December 31, 2006 reflect the impact of SFAS No. 123(R). In accordance with the modified prospective transition method, the Company consolidated financial statements for prior periods have not been restated to reflect, and do not include, the impact of SFAS No. 123(R). Stock-based compensation expense recognized under SFAS No. 123(R) for the year ended December 31, 2006 was $112 million ($73 million, net of tax) or $0.04 per share, with a corresponding amount recorded in additional paid-in capital within stockholders equity. Additionally, $10 million related to performance awards was reclassified from liabilities to stockholders equity in connection with the adoption of SFAS No. 123(R). Critical Accounting Policies The Company prepares its financial statements in conformity with accounting principles generally accepted in the U.S. The preparation of financial statements in conformity with U.S. GAAP requires the use of estimates and assumptions that affect the reported amounts of assets and liabilities, including disclosure of contingent assets and contingent liabilities, at the date of the financial statements and the reported amounts of revenue and expenses during the reporting period. The Company critical accounting policies are those that are both most important to the Company financial condition and results of operations and require the most difficult, subjective or complex judgments on the part of management in their application, often as a result of the need to make estimates about the effect of matters that are inherently uncertain. Because of the uncertainty of factors surrounding the estimates or judgments used in the preparation of the consolidated financial statements, actual results may vary from these estimates. The Company believes that the following discussion represents its critical accounting policies. Management has discussed the Company critical accounting policies with the Audit Committee of the Board of Directors. 70 Table of Contents Revenue Recognition The Company recognizes revenue in accordance with SAB No. 101, Revenue Recognition in Financial Statements , as amended by SAB No. 104, Revenue Recognition . The Company accounting policy for revenue recognition has a substantial impact on its reported results and relies on certain estimates that require difficult, subjective and complex judgments on the part of management. The Company recognizes revenue (net of the gross-to-net sales adjustments discussed below, all of which involve significant estimates and judgments) when title and substantially all the risks and rewards of ownership have transferred to the customer, which generally occurs on the date of shipment. In the case of new products for which the product introduction is not an extension of an existing line of product, where the Company determines that there are not products in a similar therapeutic category, or where the Company determines the new product has dissimilar characteristics with existing products, such that the Company cannot reliably estimate expected returns of the new product, the Company defers recognition of revenue until the right of return no longer exists or until the Company has developed sufficient historical experience to estimate sales returns. For discussions on revenue recognition, see Item 8. Financial Statements Note 1. Accounting Policies Revenue Recognition and Sales Rebate and Return Accruals. Gross-to-Net Sales Adjustments The Company has the following significant categories of gross-to-net sales adjustments: prime vendor charge-backs, WIC rebates, managed health care rebates and other contract discounts, Medicaid rebates, cash discounts, sales returns, and other adjustments, all of which involve significant estimates and judgments and require the Company to use information from external sources. The Company accounts for these gross-to-net sales adjustments in accordance with EITF Issue No. 01-9, Accounting for Consideration Given by a Vendor to a Customer (Including a Reseller of the Vendor Products) , and SFAS No. 48, Revenue Recognition When Right of Return Exists, as applicable. See Net Sales section above for a reconciliation of the Company gross sales to net sales by each significant category of gross-to-net sales adjustment. Prime vendor charge-backs The Company U.S. businesses participate in prime vendor programs with government entities, the most significant of which are the U.S. Department of Defense and the U.S. Department of Veterans Affairs, and other parties whereby pricing on products is extended below wholesaler list price to participating entities. These entities purchase products through wholesalers at the lower prime vendor price and the wholesalers charge the difference between their acquisition cost and the lower prime vendor price back to the Company. The Company accounts for prime vendor charge-backs by reducing accounts receivable in an amount equal to the Company estimate of charge-back claims attributable to a sale. The Company determines its estimate of the prime vendor charge-backs primarily based on historical experience regarding prime vendor charge-backs and current contract prices under the prime vendor programs. The Company considers prime vendor payments, levels of inventory in the distribution channel, and the Company claim processing time lag and adjusts the reduction to accounts receivable periodically throughout each quarter to reflect actual experience. WIC rebates The Company U.S. Nutritionals business participates on a competitive bidding basis in nutrition programs sponsored by states, tribal governments, the Commonwealth of Puerto Rico and the U.S. territories for WIC. Under these programs, the Company reimburses these entities for the difference between wholesaler list price and the contract price on eligible products. The Company accounts for WIC rebates by establishing an accrual in an amount equal to the Company estimate of WIC rebate claims attributable to a sale. The Company determines its estimate of the WIC rebate accrual primarily based on historical experience regarding WIC rebates and current contract prices under the WIC programs. The Company considers levels of inventory in the distribution channel, new WIC contracts, terminated WIC contracts, changes in existing WIC contracts, and WIC participation and adjusts the accrual periodically throughout each quarter to reflect actual experience. Managed health care rebates and other contract discounts The Company offers rebates and discounts to managed health care organizations in the U.S. which manage prescription drug programs and Medicare Advantage prescription drug plans covering the Medicare Part D drug benefit in addition to their commercial plans, as well as globally to other contract counterparties such as hospitals and group purchasing organizations. The Company accounts for managed health care rebates and other contract discounts by establishing an accrual in an amount equal to the Company estimate of managed health care rebates and other contract discounts attributable to a sale. The Company determines its 71 Table of Contents estimate of the managed health care rebates and other contract discounts accrual primarily based on historical experience regarding these rebates and discounts and current contract prices. The Company considers the sales performance of products subject to managed health care rebates and other contract discounts and levels of inventory in the distribution channel and adjusts the accrual periodically throughout each quarter to reflect actual experience. Medicaid rebates The Company U.S. businesses participate in state government-managed Medicaid programs as well as certain other qualifying Federal and state government programs whereby discounts and rebates are provided to participating state and local government entities. Discounts and rebates provided through these latter programs are included in the Company Medicaid rebate accrual and are considered Medicaid rebates for the purposes of this discussion. The Company accounts for Medicaid rebates by establishing an accrual in an amount equal to the Company estimate of Medicaid rebate claims attributable to a sale. The Company determines its estimate of the Medicaid rebates accrual primarily based on historical experience regarding Medicaid rebates, as well as any expansion on a prospective basis of its participation in the non-mandatory aspects of the qualifying Federal and state government programs, legal interpretations of applicable laws related to Medicaid and qualifying Federal and state government programs, and any new information regarding changes in the Medicaid programs regulations and guidelines that would impact the amount of the rebates. The Company considers outstanding Medicaid claims, Medicaid payments, and levels of inventory in the distribution channel and adjusts the accrual periodically throughout each quarter to reflect actual experience. Cash discounts In the U.S. and certain other countries, the Company offers cash discounts, approximating 2% of the sales price, as an incentive for prompt payment. The Company accounts for cash discounts by reducing accounts receivable by the full amount of the discounts. The Company considers payment performance and adjusts the accrual to reflect actual experience. Sales returns The Company accounts for sales returns in accordance with SFAS No. 48, Revenue Recognition When Right of Return Exists , by establishing an accrual in an amount equal to the Company estimate of sales recorded for which the related products are expected to be returned. In 2007, 2006 and 2005, the provision for sales returns was $160 million, $230 million and $164 million, respectively, or 1% of gross sales for each of the three years. For returns of established products, the Company determines its estimate of the sales return accrual primarily based on historical experience regarding sales returns, but also considers other factors that could impact sales returns. These factors include levels of inventory in the distribution channel, estimated shelf life, product recalls, product discontinuances, price changes of competitive products, introductions of generic products and introductions of competitive new products. The Company considers all of these factors and adjusts the accrual periodically throughout each quarter to reflect actual experience. The Company considers the level of inventory in the distribution channel and determines whether it believes an adjustment to the sales return accrual is appropriate. The Company adjusts the sales return accrual based on historical experience, the Company returned goods policy, the shelf life of the Company products, and life cycle of the product levels of inventory in the distribution channel. The Company considers introductions of generic products and factors the impact into the sales returns calculation based on historical experience and the Company returned goods policy. In the event of a product recall or product discontinuance, the Company considers the reasons for and impact of such actions and adjusts the sales return accrual as appropriate, taking into account historical experience, estimated levels of inventory in the distribution channel and, for product discontinuances, estimates of continuing demand. Sales returns accruals from new products are estimated and primarily based on the historical sales returns experience of similar products, such as those within the same line of product or those within the same or similar therapeutic category. In limited circumstances, where the new product is not an extension of an existing line of product or where the Company has no historical experience with products in a similar therapeutic category, such that the Company cannot reliably estimate expected returns of the new product, the Company defers recognition of revenue until the right of return no longer exists or until the Company has developed sufficient historical experience to estimate sales returns. The Company also considers the shelf life of new products and determines whether it believes an adjustment to the sales return accrual is appropriate. The shelf life in connection with new products tends to be shorter than the shelf life for more established products because the Company may still be developing an optimal manufacturing process for the new product that would lengthen its shelf life. In addition, higher launch quantities may have been manufactured in advance of the launch date to ensure sufficient supply exists to satisfy market demand. In those cases, the Company assesses the reduced shelf life, together with estimated levels of inventory in the distribution channel and projected demand, and determines whether it believes an adjustment to the sales return accrual is appropriate. 72 Table of Contents Other adjustments In addition to the gross-to-net sales adjustments described above, the Company makes other gross-to-net sales adjustments. For example, the Company offers sales discounts, most significantly in its non-U.S. businesses, and also offers consumer coupons and rebates, most significantly in its U.S. Nutritionals and Pharmaceuticals businesses. In addition, in a number of countries outside the U.S., including major European countries, the Company provides rebates to government entities. The Company generally accounts for these other gross-to-net adjustments by establishing an accrual in an amount equal to the Company estimate of the adjustments attributable to a sale. The Company generally determines its estimates of the accruals for these other gross-to-net sales adjustments primarily based on historical experience, performance on commitments to government entities and other relevant factors, including estimated levels of inventory in the distribution channel, and adjusts the accruals periodically throughout each quarter to reflect actual experience. Use of information from external sources The Company uses information from external sources to estimate its gross-to-net sales adjustments. The Company estimates of inventory at the wholesalers and deferred revenue on consigned inventory are based on the projected prescription demand-based sales for its products and historical inventory experience, as well as the Company analysis of third-party information, including written and oral information obtained from certain wholesalers with respect to their inventory levels and sell-through to customers and third-party market research data, and the Company internal information. The inventory information received from wholesalers is a product of their recordkeeping process and excludes inventory held by intermediaries to whom they sell, such as retailers and hospitals. The Company receives information from IMS, a supplier of market research to the pharmaceutical industry, which it uses to project the prescription demand-based sales for many of its U.S. Pharmaceutical products. Prior to the third quarter of 2005, the Company had historically reported estimated total U.S. prescription growth and estimated therapeutic category shares based on data from the IMS National Prescription Audit (NPA) under IMS legacy national projection methodology, which IMS made available on a subscription basis, and reported these data based on a simple unweighted sum of projected U.S. prescriptions in the retail and mail order channels. In the third quarter of 2005, the Company began disclosing these NPA prescription growth and therapeutic category share data based on Version 1.0 of IMS new and revised NGPS projection methodology. For consistency, NGPS Version 1.0 data were used for both current and comparative time periods to properly account for trend breaks under the new projection methodology. Coincident with the change to reporting IMS data on an NGPS Version 1.0 basis, the Company also began reporting retail and mail prescription growth and category shares on a weighted, retail-equivalent basis, which accounts for the significantly larger size of the average mail order prescription, as compared to the size of the average retail prescription. Retail equivalization calculations were applied to mail order volumes and shares for each reported product and time period. In 2007, IMS further refined and improved its NGPS projection methodology and fully rolled out NGPS Version 2.0 to all NPA subscribers, which resulted in newly revised volume estimates for historic time periods. Therefore, since the first quarter of 2007, the Company has used the new IMS standard NGPS Version 2.0 projection methodology and has applied NGPS Version 2.0 data for reporting prescription growth and market shares to all periods presented in the Annual Report on Form 10-K. The Company has also continued the practice of combining retail and mail prescription volume on a retail-equivalent basis. The Company uses this methodology for its internal demand forecasts. The Company also uses information from external sources to identify prescription trends, patient demand and average selling prices. The Company estimates are subject to inherent limitations of estimates that rely on third-party information, as certain third-party information was itself in the form of estimates, and reflect other limitations including lags between the date as of which third-party information is generated and the date on which the Company receives third-party information. Retirement Benefits The Company pension plans and postretirement benefit plans are accounted for using actuarial valuations required by SFAS No. 87, Employers Accounting for Pensions , and SFAS No. 106 , Employers Accounting for Postretirement Benefits Other Than Pensions . The Company considers accounting for retirement plans critical because management is required to make significant subjective judgments about a number of actuarial assumptions, including discount rates, salary growth, long-term return on plan assets, retirement, turnover, health care cost trend rates, and mortality rates. Depending on the assumptions and estimates used, the pension and postretirement benefit expense could vary within a range of outcomes and have a material effect on reported earnings. In addition, the assumptions can materially affect projected benefit obligations and future cash funding. The Company adopted SFAS No. 158, Employers Accounting for Defined Benefit Pension and Other Postretirement Plans an amendment of FASB Statements No. 87, 88, 106, and 132(R), in the fiscal year ended December 31, 2006 and the adoption of this accounting pronouncement resulted in a $1,064 million reduction of accumulated other comprehensive income in stockholders equity, a $767 million reduction in total assets and a $297 million increase in total liabilities. The adoption of SFAS No. 158 did not impact the Company results of operations or cash flows. 73 Table of Contents Plan Description The Company and certain of its subsidiaries have defined benefit pension plans, defined contribution plans, and termination indemnity plans for regular full-time employees. The principal defined benefit pension plan is the Bristol-Myers Squibb Retirement Income Plan and the principal defined contribution plan is the Bristol-Myers Squibb Savings and Investment Program. Approximately 75% of total Company defined benefit pension plan assets and liabilities are held in U.S. plans. The assets for the U.S. plans are held in a single trust with a common asset allocation. Unless specified otherwise, the references in this section are to total Company plans (i.e., U.S. plans together with international plans). Benefits under the Company defined benefit pension plans are based primarily on years of credited service and on participants compensation. Assets under the Company defined benefit plans consist primarily of equity and fixed-income securities. At December 31, 2007, the fair market value of plan assets for the Company defined benefit plans increased to $6,019 million from $5,658 million at December 31, 2006. For the U.S. plans, assets were allocated 67% to equity securities (compared to 69% at the end of 2006), 24% to fixed income securities (compared to 23% at the end of 2006) and 9% to private equity and other investments (compared to 8% at the end of 2006). Bristol-Myers Squibb common stock represented less than 1% of assets for the U.S. plans at the end of 2007 and 2006. The Company provides comprehensive medical and group life benefits for substantially all U.S. retirees who elect to participate in the Company comprehensive medical and group life plans. The asset allocation for these postretirement plans is identical to the asset allocation described above for the U.S. defined benefit pension plans. Accrual Accounting and Significant Assumptions Consistent with the requirements of SFAS No. 87, the Company accounts for pension benefits using the accrual method, recognizing pension expense before the payment of benefits to retirees. The accrual method of accounting for pension benefits necessarily requires actuarial assumptions concerning future events that will determine the amount and timing of the benefit payments. The Company key assumptions used in calculating its cost of pension benefits are the discount rate, the rate of compensation increase, and the expected long-term rate of return on plan assets. The Company, in consultation with its actuaries, evaluates the key actuarial assumptions and other assumptions used in calculating its cost of pension benefits, such as retirement, turnover and mortality rates, based on expectations or actual experience, as appropriate, and determines such assumptions on December 31 of each year to calculate liability information as of that date and pension expense for the following year. Depending on the assumptions used, the pension expense could vary within a range of outcomes and have a material effect on reported earnings. In addition, the assumptions can materially affect projected benefit obligations and future cash funding. Actual results in any given year may differ from those estimated because of economic and other factors. In determining the discount rate, the Company uses the yield on high quality corporate bonds that coincides with the cash flows of its plans estimated payouts. The Citigroup Above Median yield curve is used in determining the discount rate for the U.S. plans. The assumed rate of compensation increase used by the Company for determining future pension obligations reflects an estimate of the change in actual future compensation levels due to general price levels, productivity, seniority and other factors. In 2007, net pension expense for the Company defined benefit pension plans included in earnings before minority interest and income taxes was $313 million compared to $332 million in 2006. The U.S. plans pension expense for 2007 was determined using a 6.0% assumed discount rate and a 3.56% assumed rate of compensation increase. The present value of benefit obligations at December 31, 2007 for the U.S. plans was determined using a 6.75% assumed discount rate and a 3.56% assumed rate of compensation increase. If the assumed discount rate used in determining the U.S. plans pension expense for 2007 had been reduced by 0.25%, such expense would have increased by approximately $17 million. If the assumed rate of compensation increase used in determining the U.S. plans pension expense for 2007 had been reduced by 0.25%, such expense would have decreased by approximately $9 million. If the assumed discount rate used in determining the accumulated benefit obligation at December 31, 2007 had been reduced by 0.25%, the accumulated benefit obligation would have increased by $115 million. The U.S. plans pension expense for 2007 was determined using an 8.75% expected long-term rate of return on plan assets. If the expected long-term rate of return on plan assets used in determining the U.S. plans pension expense for 2007 had been reduced by 1%, such expense would have increased by $41 million. 74 Table of Contents Actual rates of return earned on U.S. plan assets for each of the last 10 years were as follows: Year Return Year Return 2007 10.3 % 2002 (13.4 )% 2006 14.9 % 2001 (6.1 )% 2005 9.8 % 2000 3.5 % 2004 12.6 % 1999 18.2 % 2003 25.0 % 1998 13.3 % At December 31, 2007, the Company increased its assumed discount rate for U.S. plans from 6.00% to 6.75% and maintained its assumed rate of compensation increase at 3.56%. Compensation is assumed to increase on a scale with different rates for different ages. The 3.56% rate disclosed at December 31, 2007 is the single rate, which, if used at each age, would produce the same present value of benefit obligations. The Company maintained the expected rate of return on U.S. plan assets at 8.75% for 2008. The Company expects that the net pension expense for its defined benefit pension plans included in earnings before minority interest and income taxes will be approximately $20 million lower in 2008 than the $313 million in 2007, reflecting primarily the increase in the discount rate. The Company has used the same assumed discount rates and expected long-term rates of return on plan assets in calculating its cost of pension benefits and its cost of other postretirement benefits for U.S. plans except in the case of the discount rates at December 31, 2007 and 2006. Rates of 6.75% and 6.00%, respectively, were used for pension benefits versus 6.50% and 5.75%, respectively, for other postretirement benefits to reflect the shorter duration of the other postretirement liabilities at December 31, 2007 and 2006, respectively. U.S. health care costs for the retiree population are assumed to increase 9.5% in 2008 and then trend down to an expected increase of 4.5% per year by 2018. If actual costs are higher than those assumed, this will likely put significant upward pressure on the Company expense for retiree health care. The effects of the Medicare Prescription Drug, Improvement and Modernization Act of 2003 are reflected in 2007 net periodic postretirement benefit cost (a reduction of $11 million) and accumulated postretirement benefit obligation at January 1, 2007 (a reduction of $98 million). Recognition of Actuarial Gains and Losses In 2006, SFAS No. 158 required the recognition of actuarial gains and losses as a component of stockholders equity in accumulated other comprehensive income while SFAS No. 87 provides for delayed recognition in years prior to 2006. These amounts arise from changes in the estimated plan benefit obligations due to changes in the assumed discount rate, differences between the actual and expected returns on plan assets, and other assumption changes. The net actuarial gain or loss, determined based on the market-related value of plan assets (which differs from fair market value and is a calculated value that recognizes changes in fair value in a systematic and rational manner over not more than five years), is amortized in pension income or expense for the year to the extent that such unrecognized net actuarial loss or gain exceeds 10% of the greater of the projected benefit obligation or the market-related value of plan assets at the beginning of the year. These net gains and losses are recognized as pension income or expense prospectively over a period that approximates the average remaining service period of active employees expected to receive benefits under the plans (approximately 10 years) to the extent that they are not offset by losses and gains in subsequent years. The unrecognized net actuarial loss reflects in large part the steady reduction of the weighted-average discount rate over the years. Unless offset by future unrecognized gains from higher discount rates or higher than expected returns on plan assets, amortization of the unrecognized loss is expected to increase pension expense by $98 million in 2008 and by progressively lower amounts for each of the following nine years. Plan Funding The Company funding policy for defined benefit plans is to contribute amounts to provide for current service and to fund past service liability. The Company contributed $323 million and $325 million to the defined benefit plans in 2007 and 2006, respectively. For discussions on retirement benefits, see Item 8. Financial Statements Note 21. Pension and Other Postretirement Benefit Plans. 75 Table of Contents Acquired In-Process Research and Development The fair value of in-process research and development acquired in a business combination is determined based on the present value of each research project projected cash flows. An income approach is utilized that is consistent with guidance in the practice aid issued by the American Institute of Certified Public Accountants, Assets Acquired in a Business Combination to Be Used in Research and Development Activities: A Focus on Software, Electronic Devices and Pharmaceutical Industries . Future cash flows are predominately based on the net income forecast of each project, consistent with historical pricing, margins, and expense levels of similar products. Revenues are estimated based on relevant market size and growth factors, expected industry trends, individual project life cycles, and the life of each research project underlying patent. In determining the fair value of each research project, expected revenues are first adjusted for technical risk of completion. The resulting cash flows are then discounted at a rate approximating the Company weighted-average cost of capital. Other acquired in-process research and development is expensed as incurred when the underlying product has not received regulatory approval and does not have any future alternative use. In addition, costs that are nonrefundable, related to the acquisition or licensing of products that have not yet received regulatory approval to be marketed and that have no alternative future use, are charged to earnings as incurred. For discussions on acquired in-process research and development, see Item 8. Financial Statements Note 1. Accounting Policies Acquired In-Process Research and Development. Impairment of Long-Lived Assets In accordance with SFAS No. 144, Accounting for the Impairment or Disposal of Long-Lived Assets , the Company periodically evaluates whether current facts or circumstances indicate that the carrying value of its depreciable assets to be held and used may not be recoverable. If such circumstances are determined to exist, an estimate of undiscounted future cash flows produced by the long-lived asset, or the appropriate grouping of assets, is compared to the carrying value to determine whether impairment exists. If an asset is determined to be impaired, the loss is measured based on the difference between the asset fair value and its carrying value. An estimate of the asset fair value is based on quoted market prices in active markets, if available. If quoted market prices are not available, the estimate of fair value is based on various valuation techniques, including a discounted value of estimated future cash flows. The Company reports an asset to be disposed of at the lower of its carrying value or its estimated net realizable value. In accordance with SFAS No. 142, Goodwill and Other Intangible Assets , goodwill is tested at least annually for impairment using a two-step process. The first step is to identify a potential impairment, and the second step measures the amount of the impairment loss, if any. Goodwill is deemed to be impaired if the carrying amount of a reporting unit goodwill exceeds its estimated fair value. SFAS No. 142 requires that indefinite-lived intangible assets be tested for impairment using a one-step process, which consists of a comparison of the fair value to the carrying value of the intangible asset. Such intangible assets are deemed to be impaired if their net book value exceeds their estimated fair value. All other intangible assets are evaluated for impairment in accordance with SFAS No. 144 as described above. The estimates of future cash flows, based on reasonable and supportable assumptions and projections, require management judgment. Any changes in key assumptions about the Company businesses and their prospects, or changes in market conditions, could result in an impairment charge. For discussions on impairment of long-lived assets, see Item 8. Financial Statements Note 1. Accounting Policies Impairment of Long-Lived Assets and Goodwill and Other Intangible Assets. Equity Investments The Company reviews its equity investments for impairment based on its determination of whether the decline in market value of the investment below the Company carrying value is other than temporary. In making this determination, the Company considers APB Opinion No. 18, The Equity Method of Accounting for Investments in Common Stock and related interpretations , which set forth factors to be evaluated in determining whether a loss in value should be recognized, including the Company ability to hold its investment, the market price and market price fluctuations of the investment publicly traded shares and inability of the investee to sustain an earnings capacity, which would justify the carrying amount of the investment. The Company investment in ImClone is subject to this accounting. For a discussion of the Company investment in ImClone, see Item 8. Financial Statements Note 2. Alliances and Investments. For discussions on equity investments, see Item 8. Financial Statements Note 1. Accounting Policies Investments and Note 2. Alliances and Investments. 76 Table of Contents Marketable Securities The Company marketable securities at December 31, 2007 consisted of U.S. dollar denominated FRS, which are primarily AAA/Aaa rated. FRS are long long-term debt securities with coupons that are reset periodically against a benchmark interest rate. The underlying assets of the Company FRS consist of primarily investment grade corporate bonds and loans. The Company accounts for its marketable securities in accordance with SFAS No. 115, Accounting for Certain Investments in Debt and Equity Securities , and classifies them as available for sale. In addition, at December 31, 2007, the Company had principal invested in ARS. The ARS held by the Company are private placement securities with long-term nominal maturities for which the interest rates are reset through a dutch auction each month. The monthly auctions historically have provided a liquid market for these securities. The Company investments in ARS represent interests in collateralized debt obligations supported by pools of residential and commercial mortgages or credit cards, insurance securitizations and other structured credits, including corporate bonds. Some of the underlying collateral for the ARS held by the Company consists of sub-prime mortgages. Due to the lack of availability of observable market quotes on the Company investment portfolio of marketable securities and ARS, the Company utilizes valuation models including those that are based on expected cash flow streams and collateral values, including assessments of counterparty credit quality, default risk underlying the security, discount rates and overall capital market liquidity. The valuation of the Company investment portfolio is subject to uncertainties that are difficult to predict. Factors that may impact the Company valuation include changes to credit ratings of the securities as well as to the underlying assets supporting those securities, rates of default of the underlying assets, underlying collateral value, discount rates, counterparty risk and ongoing strength and quality of market credit and liquidity. The credit and capital markets have continued to deteriorate in 2008. If uncertainties in these markets continue, these markets deteriorate further or the Company experiences any additional ratings downgrades on any investments in its portfolio (including on ARS), the Company may incur additional impairments to its investment portfolio, which could negatively affect the Company financial condition, cash flow and reported earnings. For discussions on marketable securities, see Item 8. Financial Statements Note 9. Cash, Cash Equivalents and Marketable Securities. Restructuring To streamline operations and rationalize manufacturing facilities, the Company has periodically recorded restructuring charges. As a result, the Company has made estimates and judgments regarding its future plans, including future termination benefits and other exit costs to be incurred when the restructuring actions take place. Actual results could vary from these estimates. Adjustments of $6 million, $14 million and $1 million were recorded in 2007, 2006 and 2005, respectively, and reflect changes in estimates for restructuring actions taken in prior periods. For discussions on restructuring, see Item 8. Financial Statements Note 1. Accounting Policies Restructuring and Note 3. Restructuring and Other Items. Contingencies In the normal course of business, the Company is subject to contingencies, such as legal proceedings and claims arising out of its business, that cover a wide range of matters, including, among others, government investigations, shareholder lawsuits, and product and environmental liability. In accordance with SFAS No. 5, Accounting for Contingencies , the Company records accruals for such contingencies when it is probable that a liability will be incurred and the amount of the loss can be reasonably estimated. These estimates are subject to uncertainties that are difficult to predict and, as such, actual results could vary from these estimates. For discussions on contingencies, see Item 8. Financial Statements Note 1. Accounting Policies Contingencies; and Note 22. Legal Proceedings and Contingencies. Income Taxes The provision for income taxes has been determined using the asset and liability approach of accounting for income taxes. Under this approach, deferred taxes represent the future tax consequences expected to occur when the reported amounts of assets and liabilities are recovered or paid. The provision for income taxes represents income taxes paid or payable for the current year plus the change in deferred taxes during the year. Deferred taxes result from differences between the financial and tax bases of the Company assets and liabilities and are adjusted for changes in tax rates and tax laws when changes are enacted. Valuation allowances are recorded to reduce deferred tax assets when it is more likely than not that a tax benefit will not be realized. The assessment of whether or not a valuation allowance is required often requires significant judgment including the long-range forecast of future taxable income and the evaluation of tax planning initiatives. Adjustments to the deferred tax valuation allowances are made to earnings in the period when such assessments are made. As of December 31, 2007 and 2006, the Company had net deferred tax assets of $3,483 million and $3,154 million, respectively, net of valuation allowances of $1,950 million and $625 million, respectively. 77 Table of Contents The Company has recorded significant deferred tax assets at December 31, 2007 related to U.S. foreign tax credit carryforwards of approximately $1,140 million, U.S. research tax credit carryforwards of approximately $275 million and charitable contribution carryfowards of $80 million. The charitable contribution carryforwards expire in varying amounts beginning in 2009, while the foreign tax credit and research tax credit carryforwards expire in varying amounts beginning in 2012. The foreign tax credit and research credit have been reduced due to derecognition under FIN No. 48. Realization of these credits and charitable contribution carryforwards is dependent on generating sufficient domestic taxable income prior to their expiration. Although realization is not assured, management believes it is more likely than not that these deferred tax assets will be realized. The Company anticipates increasing its level of domestic profitability over time by undertaking actions such as its PTI, increasing its biologics manufacturing capacity in the U.S. and implementing tax planning strategies. While increasing domestic profitability will likely cause the Company effective tax rate to increase, it will also further enhance the Company ability to utilize its foreign tax credit, research tax credit and charitable contribution carryforwards. The Company conducts business in various countries throughout the world and is subject to tax in numerous jurisdictions. As a result of its business activities, the Company files a significant number of tax returns that are subject to examination by various Federal, state, and local tax authorities. Tax examinations are often complex as tax authorities may disagree with the treatment of items reported by the Company and may require several years to resolve. The Company establishes liabilities for possible assessments by tax authorities resulting from known tax exposures including, but not limited to, transfer pricing matters, tax credits and deductibility of certain expenses. Such liabilities represent a reasonable provision for taxes ultimately expected to be paid, and may need to be adjusted over time as more information becomes known. The Company adopted FIN No. 48 on January 1, 2007. As a result of the adoption of this accounting pronouncement, the Company recognized $27 million of previously unrecognized tax benefits, which was accounted for as an increase to the opening balance of retained earnings. As previously reported, upon the adoption of FIN No. 48, the Company total amount of uncertain tax benefits as of January 1, 2007, net of deferred income tax benefits, and excluding interest and penalties, was $960 million. In addition, the Company derecognized on adoption $180 million of unrecognized tax benefits for which there is no tax rate impact when settled. As such, the gross unrecognized tax benefits at January 1, 2007 were $1,140 million. The total amount of unrecognized tax benefits on December 31, 2007, excluding amounts recorded as reductions in deferred tax assets, and excluding interest and penalties decreased to $798 million. This reduction is primarily due to tax benefits recognized from the favorable resolution of uncertain tax positions, partially offset by additional uncertain tax benefits accrued during 2007. For additional information on unrecognized tax benefits, see Item 8. Financial Statements Note 8. Income Taxes As of December 31, 2007, the Company had approximately $14.1 billion of undistributed earnings of foreign subsidiaries for which taxes have not been provided, as the Company has invested or expects to invest these undistributed earnings permanently offshore. If, in the future, these earnings are repatriated to the U.S., or if the Company determines such earnings will be remitted in the foreseeable future, additional tax provisions would be required. Due to complexities in the tax laws and the assumptions that would have to be made, it is not practicable to estimate the amounts of income taxes that would have to be provided. For discussions on income taxes, see Item 8. Financial Statements Note 1. Accounting Policies Income Taxes and Note 8. Income Taxes. Stock-Based Compensation Expense The Company adopted SFAS No. 123(R), Share-Based Payment , which requires the measurement and recognition of compensation expense for all stock-based payment awards made to employees and directors based on estimated fair values. The Company uses the modified prospective transition method, which requires the application of the accounting standard as of January 1, 2006, and has elected the alternative method as provided in FSP No. 123(R)-3 in determining the Company pool of excess tax benefits. The Company consolidated financial statements for the years ended December 31, 2007 and 2006 reflect the impact of SFAS No. 123(R). In accordance with the modified prospective transition method, the Company consolidated financial statements for prior periods have not been restated to reflect, and do not include, the impact of SFAS No. 123(R). Stock-based compensation expense recognized under SFAS No. 123(R) for the years ended December 31, 2007 and 2006 was $133 million and $112 million, respectively ($88 million and $73 million, net of tax, respectively) or $0.04 and $0.04 per share, respectively, with a corresponding amount recorded in additional paid-in capital within stockholders equity. Comparatively, on a pro forma basis, stock-based compensation expense of $31 million ($20 million, net of tax), was recognized for the year ended December 31, 2005 under APB No. 25. Additionally, $10 million related to performance awards was reclassified from liabilities to stockholders equity in connection with the adoption of SFAS No. 123(R). The Company estimates the fair value of stock-based payment awards on the date of grant using an option-pricing model. The value of the portion of the award that is ultimately expected to vest is recognized as expense over the requisite service periods in the Company consolidated statement of earnings. Prior to the adoption of SFAS No. 123(R), the Company accounted for stock-based awards to employees and directors using the intrinsic value method related to stock options in accordance with APB No. 25, as 78 Table of Contents allowed under SFAS No. 123, Accounting for Stock-Based Compensation . Under the intrinsic value method, no stock-based compensation expense had been recognized in the Company consolidated statement of earnings because the exercise price of the Company stock options granted to employees and directors equaled the fair market value of the underlying stock at the date of grant. Stock-based compensation expense recognized during the period is based on the value of the portion of stock-based payment awards that is ultimately expected to vest during the period. Stock-based compensation expense recognized in the Company consolidated statement of earnings for the years ended December 31, 2007 and 2006 included compensation expense for stock-based payment awards granted prior to, but not yet vested as of, January 1, 2006 based on the grant date fair value estimated in accordance with the pro forma provisions of SFAS No. 123(R) and compensation expense for the stock-based payment awards granted subsequent to January 1, 2006 based on the grant date fair value estimated in accordance with the provisions of SFAS No. 123(R). In conjunction with the adoption of SFAS No. 123(R), the Company changed its method of attributing the value of stock-based compensation expense from the accelerated multiple-option approach to the straight-line single option method. Compensation expense for all stock-based payment awards granted prior to 2006 will continue to be recognized using the accelerated multiple-option approach while compensation expense for all stock-based payment awards, with a service condition only, granted on or subsequent to January 1, 2006 is recognized using the straight-line single-option method. Stock-based payment awards granted on or subsequent to January 1, 2006, with both a service and market condition, will be recognized using the accelerated multiple-option approach as required under SFAS No. 123(R). Prior to 2006, the Company applied APB Opinion No. 25, and did not recognize compensation expense for stock options granted under the plans as the exercise price of the option on the date of grant is equal to the fair market value as of that date. However, for grants of restricted stock, the Company recognized compensation expense on a straight-line basis over the period that the restrictions expire. The fair value of the options granted during 2007, 2006 and 2005 was estimated as $ 6.56 per common share, $4.74 per common share and $5.49 per common share, respectively, on the date of grant using the Black-Scholes option pricing model. The assumptions used in the Black-Scholes option-pricing model were as follows: 2007 2006 2005 Expected volatility 28.9 % 26.7 % 29.4 % Risk-free interest rate 4.7 % 4.6 % 4.4 % Dividend yield 4.5 % 4.8 % 4.6 % Expected life 6.2 yrs 6.3 yrs 7.0 yrs The Company determines fair value of certain stock-based payment awards on the date of grant using an option-pricing model. This model is affected by the Company stock price as well as assumptions regarding a number of highly complex and subjective variables. These variables include, but are not limited to: the Company expected stock price volatility over the term of the awards, and actual and projected employee stock option exercise behaviors. With respect to the accounting treatment of retirement eligibility provisions of employee stock-based compensation awards, the Company has historically followed the nominal vesting period approach. Upon the adoption of SFAS No. 123(R), the Company follows the non-substantive vesting period approach and recognizes compensation cost over a one-year period for awards granted to retirement-eligible employees, or over the period from the grant date to the date retirement eligibility is achieved if more than one year, but less than the vesting period. The impact of applying the non-substantive vesting period approach is not material to the Company consolidated financial statements. As stock-based compensation expense recognized in the consolidated statements of earnings for the year ended December 31, 2007 and 2006 is based on awards ultimately expected to vest, it has been reduced for estimated forfeitures. The Company estimates forfeitures at the time of grant and revises, if necessary, in subsequent periods if actual forfeitures differ from those estimates. In the Company pro forma information required under SFAS No. 123 for the periods prior to 2006, the Company accounted for forfeitures as they occurred. Special Note Regarding Forward-Looking Statements This annual report and other written and oral statements the Company makes from time to time contain certain forward-looking statements within the meaning of Section 27A of the Securities Act of 1933 and Section 21E of the Securities Exchange Act of 1934. You can identify these forward-looking statements by the fact they use words such as should , expect , anticipate , estimate , target , may , project , guidance , intend , plan , believe and other words and terms of similar meaning and expression in connection with any discussion of future operating or financial performance. One can also identify forward-looking statements by the fact that they do not relate strictly to historical or current facts. Such forward-looking statements are based on 79 Table of Contents current expectations and involve inherent risks and uncertainties, including factors that could delay, divert or change any of them, and could cause actual outcomes to differ materially from current expectations. These statements are likely to relate to, among other things, the Company goals, plans and projections regarding its financial position, results of operations, cash flows, market position, product development, product approvals, sales efforts, expenses, performance or results of current and anticipated products and the outcome of contingencies such as legal proceedings, and financial results, which are based on current expectations that involve inherent risks and uncertainties, including internal or external factors that could delay, divert or change any of them in the next several years. The Company has included important factors in the cautionary statements included in this annual report, particularly under Item 1A. Risk Factors, that the Company believes could cause actual results to differ materially from any forward-looking statement. Although the Company believes it has been prudent in its plans and assumptions, no assurance can be given that any goal or plan set forth in forward-looking statements can be achieved and readers are cautioned not to place undue reliance on such statements, which speak only as of the date made. The Company undertakes no obligation to release publicly any revisions to forward-looking statements as a result of new information, future events or otherwise. 80 Table of Contents
