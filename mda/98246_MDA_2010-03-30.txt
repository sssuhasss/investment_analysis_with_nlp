Item 7. Management Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations. The following discussion and analysis should be read in conjunction with the Company consolidated financial statements and related notes. All references to years relate to fiscal years that end on January 31 of the following calendar year. KEY STRATEGIES The Company key strategies are: To selectively expand its global distribution without compromising the value of the TIFFANY & CO. trademark (the Brand ). Management intends to expand distribution by adding stores in both new and existing markets. Management recognizes that over-saturation of any market could diminish the distinctive appeal of the Brand, but believes that there are a significant number of locations remaining worldwide that meet the requirements of the Brand. To increase store productivity. Over the years, the Company has opened smaller size stores which have contributed to higher store productivity. In addition, the Company is focused on growing sales per square foot by increasing consumer traffic and the conversion rate (the percentage of shoppers who actually purchase) through targeted advertising, ongoing sales training and customer-focused initiatives. To achieve improved operating margins. Management long-term objective is to improve gross margin (gross profit as a percentage of net sales) through greater product manufacturing/sourcing efficiencies and increased use of distribution center capacity. Management also intends to improve the ratio of selling, general and administrative expenses to net sales by controlling expenses and enhancing productivity so that sales growth can generate a higher rate of earnings growth. To enhance customer awareness. The Brand is the single most important asset of the Company and is inherent in consumer aspirations for the Brand. Management will continue to invest in marketing and public relations programs designed to increase customer awareness of the Brand and will continue to monitor the strength of the Brand through market research. To maintain an active product development program. The Company continues to invest in product development in order to introduce new collections and add new and innovative products to existing lines. TIFFANY & CO. K - 24 Table of Contents To maintain substantial control over product supply through direct diamond sourcing and internal jewelry manufacturing. The Company diamond processing operations purchase, sort, cut and/or polish rough diamonds for use in Company merchandise. The Company will continue to seek additional sources of diamonds which, combined with its internal manufacturing operations, are intended to secure adequate product supplies and favorable costs. To provide superior customer service. Maintaining the strength of the Brand requires that the Company make superior customer service a top priority, which it achieves by employing highly qualified sales and customer service professionals and maintaining ongoing training programs. 2009 SUMMARY Worldwide net sales decreased 5% to $2,709,704,000 in 2009. Sales in most markets were affected by the global economic downturn that began in the latter half of 2008. Full year sales in the Americas declined in 2009 but increased in the fourth quarter. Full year sales in both Asia-Pacific and Europe increased in 2009. Worldwide comparable store sales decreased 8% on a constant-exchange-rate basis (see Non-GAAP Measures below), consisting of a 14% decline in the Americas, a 3% decline in Asia-Pacific (due to a decline in Japan) and a 9% increase in Europe (due to growth in all countries). However, in the fourth quarter, worldwide comparable store sales on a constant-exchange-rate basis increased 8%, including increases of 10% in the Americas, 3% in Asia-Pacific and 14% in Europe. The Company opened 14 TIFFANY & CO. retail locations, net of two closings, which increased its worldwide store base by 7% and its square footage by 5%. A decline in operating expenses reflected the Company cost-saving initiatives announced at the end of 2008 that included significant reductions in staffing and marketing spending. Net earnings increased 20% to $264,823,000 and net earnings per diluted share increased 21% to $2.11. Net earnings in 2009 and 2008 are not comparable due to several nonrecurring items recorded in those periods (see Item 6. Selected Financial Data Notes to Selected Financial Data for a listing of those items). Excluding those nonrecurring items in both years, 2009 net earnings would have decreased 14% to $254,367,000 from $294,263,000 in 2008, and 2009 net earnings per diluted share would have decreased 13% to $2.03 from $2.33 in 2008. In the first quarter of 2009, the Company secured $300,000,000 of additional long-term financing in order to refinance certain maturing debt and to provide for the Company long-term expansion plan. In the second quarter of 2009, the Company established a new $400,000,000 multi-bank, multi-currency revolving credit facility to replace an expiring facility. TIFFANY & CO. K - 25 Table of Contents NON-GAAP MEASURES The Company reported sales reflect either a translation-related benefit from strengthening foreign currencies or a detriment from a strengthening U.S. dollar. The Company reports information in accordance with U.S. Generally Accepted Accounting Principles ( GAAP ). Internally, management monitors its sales performance on a non-GAAP basis that eliminates the positive or negative effects that result from translating international sales into U.S. dollars ( constant-exchange-rate basis ). Management believes this constant-exchange-rate basis provides a more representative assessment of sales performance and provides better comparability between reporting periods. The Company management does not, nor does it suggest that investors should, consider such non-GAAP financial measures in isolation from, or as a substitute for, financial information prepared in accordance with GAAP. The Company presents such non-GAAP financial measures in reporting its financial results to provide investors with an additional tool to evaluate the Company operating results. The following table reconciles sales percentage increases (decreases) from the GAAP to the non-GAAP basis versus the previous years: 2009 2008 Constant- Constant- GAAP Translation Exchange- GAAP Translation Exchange- Reported Effect Rate Basis Reported Effect Rate Basis Net Sales: Worldwide (5 )% % (5 )% (3 )% 1 % (4 )% Americas (11 ) (11 ) (10 ) (10 ) U.S. (12 ) (12 ) (11 ) (11 ) Asia-Pacific 4 4 8 7 1 Japan (4 ) 7 (11 ) 7 14 (7 ) Other Asia-Pacific 18 (1 ) 19 10 (2 ) 12 Europe 10 (6 ) 16 17 (8 ) 25 Comparable Store Sales: Worldwide (7 )% 1 % (8 )% (7 )% 2 % (9 )% Americas (14 ) (14 ) (14 ) (14 ) U.S. (15 ) (15 ) (16 ) (16 ) Asia-Pacific 1 4 (3 ) 4 8 (4 ) Japan (4 ) 7 (11 ) 4 14 (10 ) Other Asia-Pacific 8 8 3 (2 ) 5 Europe 3 (6 ) 9 1 (5 ) 6 TIFFANY & CO.

Reference will be made to comparable store sales below. Comparable store sales include only sales transacted in Company-operated stores and boutiques. A store sales are included in comparable store sales when the store has been open for more than 12 months. In markets other than Japan, sales for relocated stores are included in comparable store sales if the relocation occurs within the same geographical market. In Japan (included in the Asia-Pacific segment), sales for a new store or boutique are not included if the store or boutique was relocated from one department store to another or from a department store to a free-standing location. In all markets, the results of a store in which the square footage has been expanded or reduced remain in the comparable store base. Americas . Americas includes sales in TIFFANY & CO. stores in the U.S., Canada and Latin/South America, as well as sales of TIFFANY & CO. products in certain of those markets through business-to-business, Internet, catalog and wholesale operations. The following table presents the Americas and its components as a percentage of worldwide net sales: 2009 2008 2007 United States New York Flagship store 9 % 10 % 10 % Branch stores 32 35 39 Internet and catalog 6 6 6 Business-to-business 1 1 2 Total United States 48 52 57 Canada and Latin/South America 4 4 3 52 % 56 % 60 % In 2009, total sales in the Americas decreased $175,791,000, or 11%, primarily due to a decline in the average price per unit sold. This decrease included a 15%, or $184,439,000, decline in U.S. comparable store sales and an increase of $14,328,000 in U.S. non-comparable stores sales. The U.S. comparable store sales decline consisted of a 15% decrease in both the New York Flagship store and comparable branch store sales. During the year, the sales decline in the New York Flagship store and the entire U.S. reflected a decrease in sales to local customers and tourists. In 2009, the Company opened five stores in the Americas. Internet and catalog sales in the U.S. decreased $1,644,000, or 1%, in 2009, as increased orders were offset by a decrease in the TIFFANY & CO. K - 27 Table of Contents average sales per order. The Company reduced its U.S. catalog mailings by approximately 35% in 2009 as the Company shifted resources toward e-mail communications to customers. In 2008, total sales in the Americas decreased $173,232,000, or 10%, due to a decline in the number of units sold. This decrease included a 16%, or $220,999,000, decline in U.S. comparable store sales, partly offset by $58,065,000 of sales growth in U.S. non-comparable stores. The U.S. comparable store sales decline consisted of a 9% decrease in New York Flagship store sales and a 16% decline in comparable branch store sales. During the year, especially in the first half, the New York Flagship store benefited from increased sales to foreign tourists. In 2008, the Company opened six stores in the Americas. Internet and catalog sales in the U.S. decreased $18,655,000, or 10%, in 2008 due to a decrease in the number of orders shipped. Asia-Pacific. Asia-Pacific includes sales in TIFFANY & CO. stores, as well as sales of TIFFANY & CO. products in certain markets through business-to-business, Internet and wholesale operations. The following table presents Asia-Pacific and its components as a percentage of worldwide net sales: 2009 2008 2007 Japan 19 % 19 % 17 % Other Asia-Pacific 16 13 12 35 % 32 % 29 % In 2009, total sales in Asia-Pacific increased $35,173,000, or 4%, due to an increase in the number of units sold. This increase included non-comparable store sales growth of $40,453,000. On a constant-exchange-rate basis, Asia-Pacific sales in 2009 remained unchanged from 2008, and comparable store sales decreased 3% due to an 11% decline in Japan partly offset by an 8% increase in other countries. In 2009, the Company opened eight stores and closed two stores in Asia-Pacific. In 2008, total sales in Asia-Pacific increased $68,229,000, or 8%, due to an increase in the average sales amount per unit. This increase included comparable store sales growth of 4%, or $28,485,000, and non-comparable store sales growth of $33,178,000. On a constant-exchange-rate basis, Asia-Pacific sales increased 1% in 2008, while comparable store sales decreased 4% due to a 10% decline in Japan partly offset by a 5% increase in other countries. In 2008, the Company opened 10 stores and closed one in Asia-Pacific. Europe. Europe includes sales in TIFFANY & CO. stores, as well as sales of TIFFANY & CO. products in certain markets through business-to-business, Internet and wholesale operations. Europe represented 12%, 10% and 8% of worldwide net sales in 2009, 2008 and 2007. The United Kingdom represents approximately half of European sales. In 2009, total sales in Europe increased $27,170,000, or 10%, due to an increase in the number of units sold. This included non-comparable store sales growth of $28,029,000, partly offset by a $5,379,000 decline in wholesale distribution. On a constant-exchange-rate basis, sales in Europe increased 16% in 2009 and comparable store sales rose 9%, reflecting growth in all countries. In 2009, the Company opened three stores in Europe. In 2008, total sales in Europe increased $41,051,000, or 17%, due to an increase in the number of units sold. This included non-comparable store sales growth of $34,910,000. On a constant-exchange-rate basis, sales in Europe increased 25% in 2008 and comparable store sales rose by TIFFANY & CO. K - 28 Table of Contents 6%, reflecting growth in the United Kingdom and most Continental European countries. In 2008, the Company opened seven stores in Europe. Other. Other consists of all non-reportable segments, primarily wholesale sales of diamonds obtained through bulk purchases that were subsequently deemed not suitable for the Company needs. In addition, Other includes earnings received from a third-party licensing agreement. In 2009, Other sales declined $25,707,000, or 46%. In 2008, Other sales decreased $14,940,000, or 21%. The decrease in sales in 2009 and 2008 was attributed to lower wholesale sales of diamonds that were deemed not suitable for the Company needs. Store Data . Gross square footage of Company-operated TIFFANY & CO. stores increased 5% to 982,000 in 2009, following a 9% increase to 935,000 in 2008. Sales per gross square foot generated by those stores were $2,404 in 2009, $2,603 in 2008 and $2,890 in 2007. Gross Margin 2009 2008 2007 Gross profit as a percentage of net sales 56.5 % 57.8 % 56.4 % Gross margin (gross profit as a percentage of net sales) declined 1.3 percentage points in 2009 and improved 1.4 percentage points in 2008. The decrease in 2009 was primarily due to higher product costs. The primary components of the increase in 2008 were: (i) a 0.7 percentage point improvement due to a $19,212,000 pre-tax charge in 2007 related to management decision to discontinue certain watch models; (ii) a 0.3 percentage point improvement due to decreased wholesale sales of diamonds; and (iii) the benefit from the Company precious metals hedging program. Management periodically reviews and may adjust retail prices to address specific market conditions, product cost increases/decreases and longer-term changes in foreign currencies/U.S. dollar relationships. Among the market conditions that the Company addresses is consumer demand for the product category involved, which may be influenced by consumer confidence and competitive pricing conditions. The Company uses derivative instruments to mitigate foreign exchange and precious metal price exposures (see Item 8. Financial Statements and Supplementary Data Note J. Hedging Instruments ). Other Operating Income In 2007, the Company entered into a sale-leaseback arrangement for the land and multi-tenant building housing a TIFFANY & CO. store in Tokyo Ginza shopping district. The Company secured a long-term lease and is leasing back the portion of the property that it occupied immediately prior to the transaction. The transaction resulted in a pre-tax gain of $105,051,000 and a deferred gain of $75,244,000, which will be amortized in selling, general and administrative expenses over a 15-year period. The pre-tax gain represents the profit on the sale of the property in excess of the present value of the minimum lease payments. The lease is accounted for as an operating lease. The lease expires in 2032; however, the Company has options to terminate the lease in 2022 and 2027 without penalty. Restructuring Charges Beginning in the fourth quarter of 2008, management implemented various cost reduction initiatives, one of which was a reduction of approximately 10% of the Company total employee TIFFANY & CO. K - 29 Table of Contents base, primarily in the U.S. Management made these reductions to more closely align staffing with the anticipated sales levels. Accordingly, in 2008, the Company recorded a pre-tax charge of $97,839,000. This charge included $63,005,000 related to pension and postretirement medical benefits, $33,166,000 related to severance costs and $1,668,000 primarily related to stock-based compensation (see Item 8. Financial Statements and Supplementary Data Note D. Restructuring Charges ). Selling, General and Administrative ( SG&A ) Expenses 2009 2008 2007 SG&A expenses as a percentage of net sales 40.2 % 40.5 % 39.9 % SG&A expenses decreased $64,217,000, or 6%, in 2009 and $15,164,000, or 1%, in 2008. SG&A expenses in those years are not comparable due to several nonrecurring charges recorded in those periods. SG&A expenses in 2009 included $442,000 of income from the following nonrecurring items: $4,442,000 of income received in connection with the assignment of the Tahera Diamond Corporation ( Tahera ) commitments and liens to an unrelated third party (see Item 8. Financial Statements and Supplementary Data Note L. Commitments and Contingencies ); and $4,000,000 charge to terminate a third-party management agreement (see Item 8. Financial Statements and Supplementary Data Note C. Acquisitions & Dispositions ). SG&A expenses in 2008 included $14,444,000 of expense from the following nonrecurring items: $11,062,000 impairment charge on the investment in Target Resources plc ( Target ) (see Item 8. Financial Statements and Supplementary Data Note L. Commitments and Contingencies ); and $3,382,000 charge for the closing of a diamond polishing facility in Yellowknife, Northwest Territories (see Item 8. Financial Statements and Supplementary Data Note C. Acquisitions & Dispositions ). SG&A expenses in 2007 included $57,981,000 of expense from the following nonrecurring items: $47,981,000 impairment charge on the note receivable from Tahera (see Item 8. Financial Statements and Supplementary Data Note L. Commitments and Contingencies ); and $10,000,000 contribution to the Tiffany & Co. Foundation, a private charitable foundation. The contribution was made from proceeds received from the sale-leaseback of the land and multi-tenant building housing a TIFFANY & CO. store in Tokyo Ginza shopping district. Excluding the nonrecurring items noted above, SG&A expenses in 2009 and 2008 would have been $1,090,169,000 and $1,139,500,000. This decrease of $49,331,000, or 4%, in 2009 was due to decreased labor and benefits costs of $37,489,000 as a result of staff reductions, and decreased marketing expenses of $44,359,000, partly offset by a $28,716,000 increase in management incentive and stock-based compensation. Excluding the nonrecurring items noted TIFFANY & CO. K - 30 Table of Contents above, SG&A expenses as a percentage of net sales would have been 40.2% and 40.0% in 2009 and 2008. Excluding the nonrecurring items noted above, SG&A expenses in 2008 and 2007 would have been $1,139,500,000 and $1,111,127,000. This increase of $28,373,000, or 3%, in 2008 is primarily due to increased depreciation and store occupancy expenses of $25,338,000 and labor and benefit costs of $18,781,000, both of which were largely due to new and existing stores, as well as an increase of $15,903,000 in marketing expenses, partly offset by a $37,056,000 decrease in management incentive and stock-based compensation. Excluding the nonrecurring items noted above, SG&A expenses as a percentage of net sales would have been 40.0% and 38.0% in 2008 and 2007. This 2.0 percentage points increase is due to the decline in sales in 2008 and the related sales de-leveraging effect on fixed costs. The Company SG&A expenses are largely fixed in nature. Variable costs (which include items such as variable store rent, sales commissions and fees paid to credit card companies) represent approximately one-fifth of total SG&A expenses.

Earnings from continuing operations increased 12% in 2009. On a segment basis, the ratio of earnings (losses) from continuing operations to each segment net sales in 2009 compared with 2008 was as follows: Americas the ratio decreased 0.6 percentage point primarily due to a decline in gross margin due to higher product costs, partly offset by decreased labor and marketing expenses as a result of the cost savings initiatives implemented at the end of 2008; Asia-Pacific the ratio decreased 0.1 percentage point due to a decline in gross margin due to higher product costs, partly offset by decreased operating expenses attributed to the cost savings initiatives; Europe the ratio remained unchanged from the prior year due to a decline in gross margin due to higher product costs, offset by operating expense leverage; and TIFFANY & CO. K - 31 Table of Contents Other the ratio decreased 27.1 percentage points due to lower wholesale sales of diamonds and the write-down of wholesale diamond inventory. Earnings from continuing operations decreased 33% in 2008. On a segment basis, the ratio of earnings (losses) from continuing operations to each segment net sales in 2008 compared with 2007 was as follows: Americas the ratio decreased 2.4 percentage points. While there was a decline in SG&A expenses tied to reduced management incentive compensation, overall profitability declined due to the sales shortfall; Asia-Pacific the ratio decreased 1.2 percentage points primarily due to a decline in gross margin due to a shift in product sales mix, and increased operating expenses related to new store openings; Europe the ratio decreased 3.0 percentage points primarily due to increased operating expenses related to new store openings; and Other the ratio decreased 5.2 percentage points primarily due to the $3,382,000 charge related to the loss on disposal of fixed assets and severance costs associated with the closing of a diamond polishing facility located in Yellowknife, Northwest Territories (see Item 8. Financial Statements and Supplementary Data Note C. Acquisitions & Dispositions ). Unallocated corporate expenses include costs related to administrative support functions which the Company does not allocate to its segments. Such unallocated costs include those for information technology, finance, legal and human resources. Unallocated corporate expenses increased in 2009 and decreased in 2008 primarily due to changes in management incentive and stock-based compensation. In addition, unallocated corporate expenses in 2007 included a $10,000,000 contribution to The Tiffany & Co. Foundation. Restructuring charges represents a $97,839,000 pre-tax charge associated with the Company staff reduction initiatives (see Item 8. Financial Statements and Supplementary Data Note D. Restructuring Charges ). Other operating income in 2009 represents $4,442,000 of income received in connection with the assignment of the Tahera commitments and liens to an unrelated third party (see Item 8. Financial Statements and Supplementary Data Note L. Commitments and Contingencies ). Other operating income in 2007 represents the $105,051,000 pre-tax gain on the sale-leaseback of the land and multi-tenant building housing a TIFFANY & CO. store in Tokyo Ginza shopping district. Other operating expenses in 2009 represents $4,000,000 paid to terminate a third-party management agreement (see Item 8. Financial Statements and Supplementary Data Note C.

Financial Statements and Supplementary Data Note L. Commitments and Contingencies ). Other operating expenses in 2007 include the $47,981,000 pre-tax impairment charge on the note receivable from Tahera (see Item 8. Financial Statements and Supplementary Data Note L. Commitments and Contingencies ) and the $19,212,000 pre-tax charge related to management decision to discontinue certain watch models. TIFFANY & CO. K - 32 Table of Contents Interest Expense and Financing Costs Interest expense increased $26,064,000 in 2009 and $4,271,000 in 2008 due to increased long-term borrowings. Other Income, Net Other income, net includes interest income, gains/losses on investment activities and foreign currency transactions. Other income, net increased $4,446,000 in 2009, as 2008 included a $4,300,000 charge related to the unrealized gains and interest receivable associated with interest rate swaps that the Company determined were impaired (see Item 8. Financial Statements and Supplementary Data Note J. Hedging Instruments ). Other income, net decreased $16,516,000 in 2008 primarily due to (i) a $5,673,000 change in foreign currency gains/losses associated with the settlement of foreign payables, (ii) the above-mentioned $4,300,000 charge and (iii) a decline in interest income. Provision for Income Taxes The effective income tax rate was 31.9% in 2009, compared with 36.5% in 2008 and 36.1% in 2007. The lower effective income tax rate in 2009 was primarily due to favorable reserve adjustments of $11,220,000 during the year associated with the settlement of certain tax audits and the expiration of statutory periods. Net Loss from Discontinued Operations In the fourth quarter of 2008, management committed to a plan to close all IRIDESSE stores. All stores were closed in 2009. The results of the IRIDESSE business have been recorded in discontinued operations. The pre-tax net loss from discontinued operations related to the Company IRIDESSE business was $6,103,000 in 2009 and $19,683,000 in 2008 (see Item 8. Financial Statements and Supplementary Data Note C. Acquisitions & Dispositions ). The Company sold Little Switzerland, Inc. in 2007 for net proceeds of $32,870,000 and recorded in discontinued operations a $54,260,000 pre-tax impairment charge ($22,602,000 after tax) due to the sale. In 2009, the Company received additional proceeds of $3,650,000 and recorded a pre-tax gain of $3,289,000 in settlement of post-closing adjustments (see Item 8. Financial Statements and Supplementary Data Note C. Acquisitions & Dispositions ). 2010 Outlook Management outlook is based on the following assumptions, which may or may not prove valid, and which should be read in conjunction with Item 1A. Risk Factors on page K-14: A worldwide net sales increase of approximately 11%. By region, sales are expected to increase by a low double-digit percentage in the Americas, a high single-digit percentage in Asia-Pacific (including a low single-digit percentage decline in Japan and at least 20% growth elsewhere) and a mid-teens percentage in Europe. Other sales are expected to decline 5%. The opening of 17 new Company-operated stores (six in the Americas, eight in Asia-Pacific and three in Europe). An increase in operating margin primarily due to a higher gross margin as well as a modest improvement in the ratio of SG&A expenses to net sales. TIFFANY & CO. K - 33 Table of Contents Interest and other expenses, net of approximately $50,000,000. An effective income tax rate of approximately 35%. Net earnings from continuing operations per diluted share of $2.45 $2.50. A high single-digit percentage increase in net inventories. Capital expenditures of approximately $200,000,000. LIQUIDITY AND CAPITAL RESOURCES Management took the following steps to address the economic downturn in 2008 and 2009. First, management reduced costs to better align expenses with expected sales. Second, the Company secured $400,000,000 of long-term debt since December 2008 to: (i) refinance debt obligations that came due during the year; (ii) use the funds for general corporate purposes; and (iii) provide financial flexibility in the event that disruptions in the economy or credit markets were to continue or worsen. In July 2009, the Company entered into a new $400,000,000 multi-bank, multi-currency, committed unsecured revolving credit facility ( Credit Facility ), and may request to increase the commitments up to $500,000,000. The Credit Facility replaced the Company previous $450,000,000 revolving credit facility. The Credit Facility is available for working capital and other corporate purposes. There was $22,842,000 outstanding under the Credit Facility at January 31, 2010. The weighted average interest rate at January 31, 2010 was 2.71%. The Credit Facility will expire in July 2012. Over the long term, the Company manages its cash and capital structure to maximize shareholder return, maintain a strong financial position and provide flexibility for future strategic initiatives. Management continuously assesses its working capital needs, capital expenditure requirements, debt service, dividend payouts, share repurchases and future investments. Management believes that the proceeds from the debt financing that the Company recently issued, other cash on hand, internally-generated cash flows and the funds available under its revolving Credit Facility are sufficient to support the Company liquidity and capital requirements for the foreseeable future. Management is currently evaluating whether to refinance some or all of the $206,815,000 of long-term debt coming due in 2010. The following table summarizes cash flows from operating, investing and financing activities: (in thousands) 2009 2008 2007 Net cash provided by (used in): Operating activities $ 687,199 $ 142,270 $ 406,055 Investing activities (80,893 ) (161,690 ) 336,512 Financing activities 10,538 (39,708 ) (664,408 ) Effect of exchange rates on cash and cash equivalents 14,300 (18,035 ) 15,610 Net cash used in discontinued operations (5,887 ) (9,046 ) (23,618 ) Net increase (decrease) in cash and cash equivalents $ 625,257 $ (86,209 ) $ 70,151 TIFFANY & CO.

The increase in 2009 from 2008 primarily resulted from a decrease in inventories and, to a lesser extent, lower income tax payments. The decrease in 2008 from 2007 primarily resulted from increased income tax payments largely associated with the sale-leasebacks of TIFFANY & CO. stores in Tokyo Ginza shopping district and on London Old Bond Street and increased inventory purchases. Working Capital. Working capital (current assets less current liabilities) and the corresponding current ratio (current assets divided by current liabilities) were $1,845,393,000 and 4.1 at January 31, 2010, compared with $1,446,812,000 and 3.4 at January 31, 2009. Accounts receivable, less allowances, at January 31, 2010 were 3% lower than January 31, 2009. Changes in foreign currency exchange rates had an insignificant effect on the change in accounts receivable. On a 12-month rolling basis, accounts receivable turnover was 18 times in 2009 and 17 times in 2008. Inventories, net at January 31, 2010 were 11% lower than January 31, 2009 due to a reduction in finished goods inventories, consistent with management objective, as well as higher than expected sales in the fourth quarter. Changes in foreign currency exchange rates had an insignificant effect on the change in inventories, net. Investing Activities The Company had net cash outflows from investing activities of $80,893,000 in 2009, and $161,690,000 in 2008 and a net cash inflow of $336,512,000 in 2007. The decreased outflow in 2009 was primarily due to a decline in capital expenditures. Investing activities in 2007 included proceeds from the sale of assets. Proceeds from Sale of Assets. In 2007, the Company received total proceeds of $509,035,000 which consisted of the following transactions: A sale-leaseback arrangement for the land and multi-tenant building housing a TIFFANY & CO. store in Tokyo Ginza shopping district. The Company received proceeds of $327,537,000 ( 38,050,000,000) (see Other Operating Income above for more information). A sale-leaseback arrangement for the building housing a TIFFANY & CO. store on London Old Bond Street. Following the renovation of the store, the Company secured a long-term lease. The Company sold the building for proceeds of $148,628,000 ( 73,000,000) and simultaneously entered into a 15-year lease with two 10-year renewal options. The transaction resulted in a deferred gain of $63,961,000, which will be amortized in SG&A expenses over a 15-year period. The Company continues to occupy the entire building and the lease is accounted for as an operating lease. Net proceeds of $32,870,000 associated with the sale of Little Switzerland. TIFFANY & CO.

Capital expenditures were $75,403,000 in 2009, $154,409,000 in 2008 and $184,266,000 in 2007, representing 3%, 5% and 6% of net sales in those respective years. The decrease in 2009 reflected a moderated rate of store openings and other cost containment. In all three years, expenditures were primarily related to the opening, renovation and expansion of stores and distribution facilities and ongoing investments in new systems. Marketable Securities. The Company invests excess cash in short-term investments and marketable securities. The Company had (net purchases of) or net proceeds from investments in marketable securities and short-term investments of ($13,433,000), ($1,543,000) and $13,182,000 during 2009, 2008 and 2007.

Year-over-year changes in cash flows from financing activities are largely driven by share repurchase activity and borrowings. Dividends. The cash dividend on the Company Common Stock was maintained in 2009, following an increase in 2008 and two increases in 2007. The Company Board of Directors declared quarterly dividends which, on an annual basis, totaled $0.68, $0.66 and $0.52 per common share in 2009, 2008 and 2007.

In January 2008, the Company Board of Directors amended the existing share repurchase program to extend the expiration date of the program to January 2011 and to authorize the repurchase of up to an additional $500,000,000 of the Company Common Stock. The timing of repurchases and the actual number of shares to be repurchased depend on a variety of discretionary factors such as stock price, cash-flow forecasts and other market conditions. The Company share repurchase activity was as follows: (in thousands, except per share amounts) 2009 2008 2007 Cost of repurchases $ 467 $ 218,379 $ 574,608 Shares repurchased and retired 11 5,375 12,374 Average cost per share $ 41.72 $ 40.63 $ 46.44 The Company suspended share repurchases during the third quarter of 2008 in order to conserve cash.

Borrowings may currently be made from nine participating banks and are at interest rates based upon local currency borrowing rates plus a margin based on the Company leverage ratio. Proceeds from the issuances of long-term debt and short-term borrowings were used to refinance existing indebtedness and for general corporate purposes. The issuances of long-term borrowings during 2009 have maturity dates that range from 2017 to 2019 with interest rates of 10.00%. The issuance of long-term borrowings during 2008 has a maturity date of 2015 with an interest rate of 9.05% (see Item 8. Financial Statements and Supplementary Data Note I. Debt for additional details regarding recent borrowings).

Inventory purchase obligations associated with these agreements have been estimated for 2010 and included in this table. Purchases beyond 2010 that are contingent upon mine production have been excluded as they cannot be reasonably estimated. b) Excludes interest payments on amounts outstanding under available lines of credit, as the outstanding amounts fluctuate based on the Company working capital needs. Variable-rate interest payments were estimated based on rates at January 31, 2010. Actual payments will differ based on changes in interest rates. c) Other contractual obligations consist primarily of royalty commitments and the remaining consideration to be paid for the purchase of noncontrolling interests (see Purchase of Noncontrolling Interests above). The summary above does not include the following items: Cash contributions to the Company pension plan and cash payments for other postretirement obligations. The Company plans to contribute approximately $40,000,000 to the pension plan in 2010. However, this expectation is subject to change if actual asset performance is different than the assumed long-term rate of return on pension plan assets. The Company estimates cash payments for postretirement health-care and life insurance benefit obligations to be $2,297,000 in 2010. Unrecognized tax benefits at January 31, 2010 of $32,226,000 and accrued interest and penalties of $3,305,000. The final outcome of tax uncertainties is dependent upon various matters including tax examinations, interpretation of the applicable tax laws or expiration of statutes of limitations. The Company believes that its tax positions comply with applicable tax law and that it has adequately provided for these matters. However, the audits may result in proposed assessments where the ultimate resolution may result in the Company owing additional taxes. Ongoing audits are in various stages of completion and, while the Company does not anticipate any material changes in unrecognized income tax benefits over the next 12 months, future developments in the audit process may result in a change in these assessments.

Seasonality As a jeweler and specialty retailer, the Company business is seasonal in nature, with the fourth quarter typically representing at least one-third of annual net sales and approximately one-half of annual net earnings. Management expects such seasonality to continue. CRITICAL ACCOUNTING ESTIMATES The Company consolidated financial statements have been prepared in accordance with accounting principles generally accepted in the United States of America. These principles require management to make certain estimates and assumptions that affect amounts reported and disclosed in the financial statements and related notes. Actual results could differ from those estimates, and the differences could be material. Periodically, the Company reviews all significant estimates and assumptions affecting the financial statements and records any necessary adjustments. The development and selection of critical accounting estimates and the related disclosures below have been reviewed with the Audit Committee of the Company Board of Directors. The following critical accounting policies that rely on assumptions and estimates were used in the preparation of the Company consolidated financial statements: Inventory. The Company writes down its inventory for discontinued and slow-moving products. This write-down is equal to the difference between the cost of inventory and its estimated market value, and is based on assumptions about future demand and market conditions. If actual market conditions are less favorable than those projected by management, additional inventory write-downs might be required. The Company has not made any material changes in the accounting methodology used to establish its reserve for discontinued and slow-moving products during the past three years. At January 31, 2010, a 10% change in the reserve for discontinued and slow-moving products would have resulted in a change of $4,623,000 in inventory and cost of sales. The Company inventories are valued using the average cost method. Fluctuation in inventory levels, along with the costs of raw materials, could affect the carrying value of the Company inventory. Long-lived assets . The Company long-lived assets are primarily property, plant and equipment. The Company reviews its long-lived assets for impairment when management determines that the carrying value of such assets may not be recoverable due to events or changes in circumstances. Recoverability of long-lived assets is evaluated by comparing the carrying value of the asset with estimated future undiscounted cash flows. If the comparisons indicate that the value of the asset TIFFANY & CO. K - 39 Table of Contents is not recoverable, an impairment loss is calculated as the difference between the carrying value and the fair value of the asset and the loss is recognized during that period. The Company recorded impairment charges of $15,532,000 in 2007, which have been included in discontinued operations. The Company did not record any material impairment charges in 2009 or 2008 (see Item 8. Financial Statements and Supplementary Data Note B. Summary of Significant Accounting Policies and Note C. Acquisitions & Dispositions ). Goodwill . The Company performs its annual impairment evaluation of goodwill during the fourth quarter of its fiscal year or when circumstances otherwise indicate an evaluation should be performed. The evaluation, based upon discounted cash flows, requires management to estimate future cash flows, growth rates and economic and market conditions. The 2009, 2008 and 2007 evaluations resulted in no impairment charges. Income taxes . The Company is subject to income taxes in both the U.S. and foreign jurisdictions. The calculation of the Company tax liabilities involves dealing with uncertainties in the application of complex tax laws and regulations in a multitude of jurisdictions across the Company global operations. Significant judgments and estimates are required in determining the consolidated income tax expense. The Company income tax expense, deferred tax assets and liabilities and reserves for uncertain tax positions reflects management best assessment of estimated future taxes to be paid. Foreign and domestic tax authorities periodically audit the Company income tax returns. These audits often examine and test the factual and legal basis for positions the Company has taken in its tax filings with respect to its tax liabilities, including the timing and amount of deductions and the allocation of income among various tax jurisdictions ( tax filing positions ). Management believes that its tax filing positions are reasonable and legally supportable. However, in specific cases, various tax authorities may take a contrary position. In evaluating the exposures associated with the Company various tax filing positions, management records reserves using a more-likely-than-not recognition threshold for income tax positions taken or expected to be taken. Earnings could be affected to the extent the Company prevails in matters for which reserves have been established or is required to pay amounts in excess of established reserves. In evaluating the Company ability to recover its deferred tax assets within the jurisdiction from which they arise, management considers all available evidence. The Company records valuation allowances when management determines it is more likely than not that deferred tax assets will not be realized in the future. Employee benefit plans . The Company maintains several pension and retirement plans, as well as provides certain postretirement health-care and life insurance benefits for retired employees. The Company makes certain assumptions that affect the underlying estimates related to pension and other postretirement costs. Significant changes in interest rates, the market value of securities and projected health-care costs would require the Company to revise key assumptions and could result in a higher or lower charge to earnings. The Company used discount rates of 7.25% and 7.50% to determine its 2009 pension expense for all U.S. plans and 7.25% to determine its 2009 postretirement expense. Holding all other assumptions constant, a 0.5% increase in the discount rate would have decreased 2009 pension and postretirement expenses by $1,454,000 and $180,000. A decrease of 0.5% in the discount rate would have increased the 2009 pension and postretirement expenses by $2,777,000 and $189,000. The discount rate is subject to change each year, consistent with changes in the yield on applicable high-quality, long-term corporate bonds. Management selects a discount rate at which pension and postretirement benefits could be effectively settled based on (i) an analysis of TIFFANY & CO. K - 40 Table of Contents expected benefit payments attributable to current employment service and (ii) appropriate yields related to such cash flows. The Company used an expected long-term rate of return of 7.50% to determine its 2009 pension expense. Holding all other assumptions constant, a 0.5% change in the long-term rate of return would have changed the 2009 pension expense by $973,000. The expected long-term rate of return on pension plan assets is selected by taking into account the average rate of return expected on the funds invested or to be invested to provide for the benefits included in the projected benefit obligation. More specifically, consideration is given to the expected rates of return (including reinvestment asset return rates) based upon the plan current asset mix, investment strategy and the historical performance of plan assets. For postretirement benefit measurement purposes, an 8.00% annual rate of increase in the per capita cost of covered health care was assumed for 2010. The rate was assumed to decrease gradually to 5.00% by 2016 and remain at that level thereafter. A one-percentage-point change in the assumed health-care cost trend rate would not have a significant effect on the aggregate service and interest cost components of the 2009 postretirement expense.
