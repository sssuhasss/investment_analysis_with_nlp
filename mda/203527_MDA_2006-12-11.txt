Item 7. Management Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations Overview Demand for advanced products for image guided radiotherapy, or IGRT, intensity modulated radiation therapy, or IMRT, stereotactic radiosurgery, brachytherapy and filmless X-ray imaging, contributed to our growth in net orders, revenues and net earnings in fiscal year 2006. Both Oncology Systems and X-Ray Products business segments contributed positively to the growth in annual net orders, revenues and operating earnings. Our fiscal year 2006 revenues and net orders were up 16% and 14%, respectively from fiscal year 2005. Gross margin as a percentage of revenues decreased 1.4 percentage points in fiscal year 2006 from fiscal year 2005 primarily due to the decrease in our Oncology Systems gross margins, which included share-based compensation expenses related to our adoption of Statement of Financial Accounting Standards No. 123 (revised 2004), Share-Based Payment , or SFAS 123(R). In fiscal year 2006, our net earnings from continuing operations, which included share-based compensation expenses and tax benefits of certain discrete tax items, increased 18% from prior year. Oncology Systems . Our largest business segment is Oncology Systems, which designs, manufacturers, sells and services hardware and software products for treating cancer with radiation, including linear accelerators, treatment simulation and verification products, brachytherapy equipment, information management and treatment planning software and other sophisticated accessory products and services. During the first quarter of fiscal year 2006, we moved the BrachyTherapy business from the Other category to the Oncology Systems business segment as our Chief Executive Officer, the Chief Operating Decision Maker, has begun to evaluate the BrachyTherapy business as part of the Oncology Systems segment due to the natural synergies in the area of radiation therapy oncology. In our view, the fundamental market drivers for long-term growth in the radiation therapy and stereotactic radiosurgery markets continue to be the rising cancer incidence; underserved medical needs outside of the United States; technology advances that are leading to improvements in patient care; customer demand for more advanced and effective cancer treatments, such as IMRT, IGRT, stereotactic radiosurgery and brachytherapy; competitive conditions among hospitals and clinics to offer such advanced treatments; and improvement in cost efficiency in delivering radiation therapy. Our primary goal in the Oncology Systems business segment is to promote the adoption of these more advanced and effective cancer treatments. We are seeing customers accept IGRT as the next significant enhancement in curative radiation therapy and demand for our products for IGRT is one of the main contributors to net orders and revenues growth in our Oncology Systems business segment. As of the end of fiscal year 2006, more than 325 installations of our On-Board Imager product, or OBI, for our high-energy Clinac accelerators and Trilogy linear accelerators, two of our products for enabling IGRT, were either complete or in progress. We believe that IGRT will continue to be one of the main contributors to net orders and revenue growth in our Oncology Systems business segment, with North America ahead of international regions in the timing of IGRT adoption. For fiscal year 2006, Oncology Systems revenues and net orders increased over fiscal year 2005 primarily due to continued growth in demand for our new products for IGRT in North America and our products for IMRT in the international regions. We believe Oncology Systems is experiencing its strongest growth in North America as this region adopts new medical technology for IGRT and stereotactic radiosurgery. International net orders increased modestly in fiscal year 2006 after several years of strong international growth driven by the rapid adoption of IMRT technology and the underserved medical needs outside of the United States. International revenues remained strong; however, as orders placed in prior periods were delivered. We believe these regional fluctuations in demand are consistent with the historical pattern where the international regions and North America region have different cycles of demand and technology adoption, with one growing more rapidly while the other is in a relatively slow growth phase. We are, however, seeing a faster adoption rate for IGRT as compared to IMRT which may lead to more 43 Table of Contents compressed growth phase cycles. We continue to expect that the Oncology Systems business segment can sustain a global long-term growth of 10% to 15% due to the fundamental market drivers. Oncology Systems gross margin in fiscal year 2006 decreased from fiscal year 2005 due principally to higher ramp-up costs and higher proportion of revenue associated with our new products for IGRT, increased share-based compensation expense and a continuing mix shift towards a higher proportion of international revenues, which typically have lower gross margins than revenues from North America. We expect that factors such as the mix between relatively higher and lower margin products, mix of geographic regions in which our products are sold, and the level of new products deliveries, could result in fluctuation in gross margins as a percentage of revenues. While we have initiatives to shorten installation time for our new products, which we believe will reduce the delay in revenue recognition; we expect that our deferred revenue may continue to increase as a normal function of our revenues increasing. Normalization of the rate of increase in deferred revenue may not result in an improvement in gross margin since the other factors of product mix or geographic mix may have offsetting effects. Our success in Oncology Systems largely depends upon our ability to retain leadership in technological innovation, the cost effectiveness of our products, the efficacy of our treatment technology and external economic influences. Factors affecting the adoption rate of new technologies such as IGRT could include our internal efficiency in design, documentation and testing, deployment and installation and the more-widely demonstrated efficacy of IGRT by early adopters. They may also include customer training, reimbursement and our ability to educate customers about the cost effectiveness of our new technologies and clinical outcome advantages. External economic influences could include hospital financial strength in the United States, foreign currency exchange rates and governmental healthcare policies outside the United States. X-Ray Products . Our X-ray Products business segment manufactures and sells (i) X-ray tubes for use in a range of applications including computed tomography, or CT, scanning, radioscopic/fluoroscopic imaging, mammography, special procedures and industrial applications and (ii) flat panel digital image detectors for filmless X-rays (commonly referred to as flat panel detectors or digital image detectors), which is an alternative to image intensifier tubes for fluoroscopy and X-ray film for radiography. We continue to view the fundamental growth driver for the component business to be the on-going success of key original equipment manufacturers, or OEMs, that incorporate our X-ray tube products and flat panel detectors into their medical diagnostic and industrial imaging systems. Our flat panel detectors are being incorporated into next generation imaging equipment, including equipment for IGRT such as OBI, and for dental CT scanning and veterinary X-ray imaging. X-ray Products net orders, revenues and operating earnings had solid growth in fiscal year 2006 over fiscal year 2005 due primarily to continuing strong demand for our flat panel detectors. We are investing to increase manufacturing capacity and quality for the flat panel detector product line. We have invested $12 million as of the end of fiscal year 2006 and expect to invest an additional $25 million over the next twelve months into dpiX Holding LLC, or dpiX Holding, which will help fund the acquisition and construction of a new $92 million Gen 4 fabrication facility in Colorado where the next generation of amorphous silicon arrays will be produced. dpiX Holding (through its subsidiary, dpiX LLC) is a key supplier of amorphous silicon arrays for our flat panel detector products and we are a 40% equity owner in dpiX Holding. At our own facility in Salt Lake City, we have also invested in the expansion of the manufacturing plant where our flat panel detectors are assembled. Our success in our X-ray Products business depends upon our ability to anticipate changes in our markets, the direction of technological innovation and the demands of our customers. Factors affecting the success of our X-ray Products business include our ability to develop products with lower cost, better quality and superior technology and performance, and to maintain strong relationships with our OEM customers. 44 Table of Contents Other . During the first quarter of fiscal year 2006, we moved the Security and Inspection Products business, or SIP, from the Oncology Systems segment into the Other category, which is now comprised of SIP and the operations of the Ginzton Technology Center, or GTC (see Note 14 Segment Information of the Notes to the Consolidated Financial Statements within this Annual Report on Form 10-K). SIP designs, manufactures, sells and services Linatron X-ray accelerators for security and inspection purposes, such as cargo screening, border protection and nondestructive examination for a variety of applications. We generally sell our Linatron X-ray accelerators to OEMs who incorporate our accelerators into their inspection systems, which are then sold to custom agencies and other government and military agencies, as well as to commercial private parties in the casting, power, aerospace, chemical, petro-chemical and automotive industries. We believe growth in this business will be driven by security cargo screening and border protection needs, as well as by the needs of customs agencies to verify shipments for assessing duties and taxes. As a result, this business is heavily influenced by U.S. and foreign governmental policies on national and homeland security, border protection and customs revenue activities, which depend upon government budgets and appropriations and which are subject to political changes. The U.S. government is adopting a layered approach to port and border security including deployment of passive detectors, which we do not manufacture, and X-ray imaging and automatic detection systems for weapons of mass destruction, for which we do manufacture and sell key components and subsystems. While we are optimistic about the long-term potential of our SIP business and encouraged by the increased interest in our SIP products, use of this technology in security cargo screening and border protection is in its early stages. Orders and revenues for our SIP products may be unpredictable as governmental agencies may place larger orders with our OEM customers in a short time period and then may not place any orders for a long time period thereafter. GTC, our research facility for new and potential markets, continues to invest in developing technologies that enhance our current businesses or may lead to new business areas, including next generation digital X-ray imaging technology, volumetric and functional imaging, improved X-ray sources and technology for security and cargo screening applications. In addition, GTC is developing technologies and products that are designed to improve disease management by more precise targeting of radiation, as well as by employing targeted energy and molecular agents to enhance the effectiveness and broaden the application of radiation therapy. This discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations is based upon and should be read in conjunction with the consolidated financial statements and the notes included elsewhere in this Annual Report on Form 10-K, as well as the information contained under Risk Factors in Item 1A. We discuss our results of operations below. Critical Accounting Estimates The preparation of our financial statements and related disclosures in conformity with generally accepted accounting principles in the United States of America, or GAAP, requires us to make estimates and assumptions that affect the reported amounts of assets, liabilities, revenues and expenses. These estimates and assumptions are based on historical experience and on various other factors that we believe are reasonable under the circumstances. We periodically review our accounting policies and estimates and make adjustments when facts and circumstances dictate. In addition to the accounting policies that are more fully described in the Notes to the Consolidated Financial Statements included in this Annual Report on Form 10-K, we consider the critical accounting policies described below to be affected by critical accounting estimates. Our critical accounting policies that are affected by accounting estimates include share-based compensation expense, revenue recognition, valuation of allowance for doubtful accounts, valuation of inventories, assessment of recoverability of goodwill and intangible assets, valuation of warranty obligations, assessment of environmental remediation liabilities, valuation of defined benefit and post-retirement benefit plans and valuation of taxes on earnings. Such accounting 45 Table of Contents policies are impacted significantly by judgments, assumptions and estimates used in the preparation of the Consolidated Financial Statements, and actual results could differ materially from these estimates. For a discussion of how these estimates and other factors may affect our business, also see Risk Factors In Item 1A. Share-based Compensation Expense Effective October 1, 2005, we adopted SFAS 123(R), which requires the measurement and recognition of compensation expense for all share-based payment awards made to employees and directors, including stock options, employee stock purchases under the Employee Stock Purchase Plan, restricted stock and deferred stock units based on fair values. Our financial statements in fiscal year 2006 reflect the impact of SFAS 123(R) under the modified prospective transition method. In accordance with the modified prospective transition method, our financial statements for prior periods have not been restated to reflect, and do not include, the impact of SFAS 123(R). Share-based compensation expense is based on the value of the portion of share-based payment awards that is ultimately expected to vest. Share-based compensation expense recognized in our Consolidated Statement of Earnings during fiscal year 2006 included compensation expense for share-based payment awards granted prior to, but not yet vested as of, September 30, 2005 based on the grant date fair value estimated in accordance with the pro forma provisions of SFAS No. 123, Accounting for Stock-Based Compensation , or SFAS 123, and compensation expense for the share-based payment awards granted subsequent to September 30, 2005 based on the grant date fair value estimated in accordance with the provisions of SFAS 123(R). In conjunction with the adoption of SFAS 123(R), we elected to attribute the value of share-based compensation to expense using the straight-line method, which was previously used for our pro forma information required under SFAS 123. For fiscal year 2006, total share-based compensation expense, before taxes on earnings, was $40.8 million. During fiscal year 2005, there was no share-based compensation expense related to stock options or employee stock purchases recognized under the intrinsic value method in accordance with Accounting Principles Board Opinion No. 25, Accounting for Stock Issued to Employees , or APB 25. For fiscal years 2005 and 2004, share-based compensation expense related to restricted stock, before taxes on earnings, was $1.1 million and $1.2 million, which was recorded under APB 25. See Note 11 of the Notes to the Consolidated Financial Statements for additional information. Upon adoption of SFAS 123(R), we elected to value our share-based payment awards granted beginning in fiscal year 2006 using the Black-Scholes option-pricing model, or the Black-Scholes model, which we previously used for the pro forma information required under SFAS 123. For additional information, see Note 11 of the Notes to the Consolidated Financial Statements. The determination of fair value of share- based payment awards on the date of grant using the Black-Scholes model is affected by VMS stock price as well as the input of other subjective assumptions. These assumptions include, but are not limited to the expected term of stock options and the expected price volatility of VMS stock over the expected term of the awards. Option-pricing models were developed for use in estimating the value of traded options that have no vesting restrictions and are fully transferable. Our stock options and the option component of the Employee Stock Purchase Plan shares have characteristics significantly different from those of traded options, and changes in the assumptions can materially affect the fair value estimates. The expected term of stock options represents the weighted average period the stock options are expected to remain outstanding. The expected term is based on the observed and expected time to post-vesting exercise and forfeitures of stock options by our employees. Upon the adoption of SFAS 123(R), we determined the expected term of stock options based on the demographic grouping of employees and retirement eligibility. Prior to the first quarter of fiscal 2006, we determined the expected term of stock options based on the demographic grouping of employees. Upon adoption of SFAS 123(R), we used a combination of historical and implied volatility, or blended volatility, in deriving the expected volatility assumption as allowed under SFAS 123(R) and Staff Accounting Bulletin No. 107, or SAB 107. Implied 46 Table of Contents volatility was derived based on six-month traded options on our common stock. Prior to the first quarter of fiscal year 2006, we had used our historical stock price volatility in accordance with SFAS 123 for purposes of our pro forma information. The selection of the blended volatility approach was based upon the availability of traded options on our stock and our assessment that blended volatility is more representative of future stock price trends than just historical volatility alone. The risk-free interest rate assumption is based upon observed interest rates appropriate for the term of our stock options. The dividend yield assumption is based on our history and expectation of dividend payouts. As share-based compensation expense recognized in the Consolidated Statement of Earnings for fiscal year 2006 is based on awards ultimately expected to vest, it has been reduced for estimated forfeitures. SFAS 123(R) requires forfeitures to be estimated at the time of grant and revised, if necessary, in subsequent periods if actual forfeitures differ from those estimates. Forfeitures were estimated based on our historical experience. In our pro forma information required under SFAS 123 for the periods prior to October 1, 2005, we accounted for forfeitures as they occurred. If factors change and we employ different assumptions in the application of SFAS 123(R) in future periods, the compensation expense that we record under SFAS 123(R) may differ significantly from what we have recorded in the current period. As of September 29, 2006, there was $33.6 million of total unrecognized compensation expense related to stock options granted under the Omnibus Stock Plan, the 2000 Stock Option Plan, the 2005 Omnibus Stock Plan and the Amended and Restated 2005 Omnibus Stock Plan (together, the Employee Stock Plans ). This unrecognized compensation expense is expected to be recognized over a weighted average period of 1.7 years. As of September 29, 2006, there was $2.7 million of total unrecognized compensation expense related to restricted stock and deferred stock units granted under the Employee Stock Plans. This unrecognized compensation expense is expected to be recognized over a weighted average period of 8.3 years. Revenue Recognition We frequently enter into sales arrangements with customers that contain multiple elements or deliverables such as hardware, software and services. Judgments as to the allocation of the proceeds received from an arrangement to the multiple elements of the arrangement, the determination of whether any undelivered elements are essential to the functionality of the delivered elements and the appropriate timing of revenue recognition are critical in respect to these arrangements to ensure compliance with GAAP. In addition, the amount of product revenues recognized is affected by our judgments as to whether objective and reliable evidence of fair value exists for hardware products and vendor-specific objective evidence of the fair value for software products in arrangements with multiple elements. Changes to the elements in an arrangement and the ability to establish objective and reliable evidence of fair value or vendor-specific objective evidence of the fair value for those elements could affect the timing of revenue recognition. Revenue recognition also depends on the timing of shipment and is subject to customer acceptance and the readiness of customers facilities. If shipments are not made on scheduled timelines or if the products are not accepted by the customer in a timely manner, our reported revenues may differ materially from expectations. Allowance for Doubtful Accounts Credit evaluations are undertaken for all major sale transactions before shipment is authorized. Normal payment terms usually require payment of a small portion of the total amount due upon signing of the purchase order contract, a significant amount upon transfer of risk of loss and the remaining amount upon completion of the installation. On a quarterly basis, we evaluate aged items in the accounts receivable aging report and provide an allowance in an amount we deem adequate for doubtful accounts. If our evaluation of our customers financial conditions does not reflect the future ability to collect outstanding receivables, additional provisions may be needed and our future operating results could be negatively impacted. 47 Table of Contents Inventories Our inventories include high technology parts and components that may be specialized in nature or subject to rapid technological obsolescence. We have programs to minimize the required inventories on hand and we regularly review inventory quantities on hand and adjust for excess and obsolete inventory based primarily on historical usage rates and our estimates of product demand and production. Actual demand may differ from our estimates, in which case we may have understated or overstated the provision required for obsolete and excess inventory, which would have an impact on our operating results. Goodwill and Intangible Assets Goodwill is initially recorded when the purchase price paid for a business acquisition exceeds the estimated fair value of the net identified tangible and intangible assets acquired. The majority of companies that we have acquired have not had significant identified tangible assets and, as a result, a significant portion of the purchase price has been typically allocated to intangible assets and goodwill. Our future operating performance will be impacted by the future amortization of these acquired intangible assets and potential impairment charges related to goodwill if indicators of impairment exist. As a result of business acquisitions, the allocation of the purchase price to goodwill and intangible assets could have a significant impact on our future operating results. The allocation of the purchase price of the acquired companies to goodwill and intangible assets requires us to make significant estimates and assumptions, including estimates of future cash flows expected to be generated by the acquired assets and the appropriate discount rate for these cash flows. Should conditions be different from management estimates at the time of the acquisition, material write-downs of intangible assets and/or goodwill may be required, which would adversely affect our operating results. We will continue to make assessments of impairment on an annual basis in the fourth quarter of our fiscal years or more frequently if indicators of potential impairment arise. In fiscal years 2006 and 2005, we performed such evaluations and found no impairment. Warranty Obligations We warrant most of our products for a specific period of time, usually one year, against material defects. We provide for the estimated future costs of warranty obligations in cost of revenues when the related revenues are recognized. The accrued warranty costs represent our best estimate at the time of sale of the total costs that we will incur to repair or replace product parts that fail while still under warranty. The amount of accrued estimated warranty costs obligation for established products is primarily based on historical experience as to product failures adjusted for current information on repair costs. For new products, estimates will include historical experience of similar products, as well as reasonable allowance for start-up expenses. Actual warranty costs could differ from the estimated amounts. On a quarterly basis, we review the accrued balances of our warranty obligations and update the historical warranty cost trends. If we were required to accrue additional warranty cost in the future, it would negatively impact our operating results. Environmental Matters We are subject to a variety of environmental laws around the world regulating the handling, storage, transport and disposal of hazardous materials that do or may create increased costs for some of our operations. Environmental remediation liabilities are recorded when environmental assessments and/or remediation efforts are probable and the costs of these assessments or remediation efforts can be reasonably estimated, in accordance with Statement of Financial Accounting Standards No. 5, Accounting for Contingencies, and the American Institute of Certified Public Accountants, Statement of Position 96-1, Environmental Remediation Liabilities. The accrued environmental costs represent our best estimate as to the total costs of remediation and the time period over which these costs will be 48 Table of Contents incurred. On a quarterly basis, we review these accrued balances. If we were required to accrue additional environmental remediation costs in the future, it would negatively impact our operating results. Defined Benefit and Post-Retirement Benefit Plans We sponsor four defined benefit pension plans in Germany, Japan, Switzerland and the United Kingdom covering the employees who meet the applicable eligibility requirements. We do not have any defined benefit pension plan in the United States. Several statistical and other factors that attempt to anticipate future events are used in calculating the expense and liability related to those plans for which the benefit is actuarially determined. These factors include assumptions about the discount rate, expected return on plan assets, rate of future compensation increases and healthcare cost increases, which we determine within certain guidelines. In addition, we also use subjective factors, such as withdrawal and mortality rates, to calculate the expense and liability. The actuarial assumptions we use are long-term assumptions and may differ materially from actual experience in the short-term due to changing market and economic conditions and changing participant demographics. These differences may have a significant impact on the amount of pension expense we recorded. The expected rates of return on the various defined benefit pension plans assets are based on the asset allocation of each plan and the long-term projected return of those assets. The discount rate enables us to state expected future cash flows at a present value on the measurement date. The discount rates used for defined benefit plans in all countries are based on high quality AA-rated corporate bonds with durations corresponding to the expected durations of the benefit obligations. In countries where the corporate bond market is not sufficiently representative at longer durations, the discount rate also takes into account the yield of long-term government bonds corresponding to the duration of the benefit obligations and the difference between the yield curve on high quality corporate fixed-income investments and government fixed-income investment. A lower discount rate increases the present value of benefit obligations. Taxes on Earnings We are subject to taxes on earnings in both the United States and numerous foreign jurisdictions. As a global taxpayer, significant judgments and estimates are required in evaluating our tax positions and determining our provision for taxes on earnings. The calculation of our tax liabilities involves addressing uncertainties in the application of complex tax regulations. We maintain reserves for potential tax contingencies arising in the jurisdictions in which we do business. Such reserves are based on our assessment of the likelihood of an unfavorable outcome and the potential loss from such contingencies, and may be adjusted from time to time in light of changing facts and circumstances. These reserves are maintained until such time as the matter is settled or the statutory period for adjustment has passed. Adjustments could be required in the future if we determine that our reserves for tax contingencies are inadequate. The provision for taxes on earnings includes the effect of changes to these reserves that are considered appropriate. In addition, the carrying value of our net deferred tax assets assumes that we will be able to generate sufficient future taxable earnings in certain tax jurisdictions to utilize these deferred tax assets. Should we conclude it is more likely than not that we will be unable to recover our net deferred tax assets in these tax jurisdictions, a valuation allowance would be recorded and our tax provision would increase in the period in which we make such a determination. Earnings derived from our international regions are generally taxed at rates lower than U.S. rates. Our effective rate is impacted by existing tax laws in both the United States and in the respective countries in which our international subsidiaries are located. In addition, a decrease in the percentage of our total earnings from our international regions, or a change in the mix of international regions among particular 49 Table of Contents tax jurisdictions, could increase our effective tax rate. Also, our current effective tax rate does not assume U.S. taxes on undistributed profits of certain foreign subsidiaries. These earnings could become subject to incremental foreign withholding or U.S. federal and state taxes should they either be deemed or actually remitted to the United States. Results of Operations Fiscal Year Our fiscal year is the 52- or 53-week period ending on the Friday nearest September 30. Fiscal year 2006 comprised the 52-week period ended on September 29, 2006. Fiscal year 2005 comprised the 52-week period ended on September 30, 2005 and fiscal year 2004 was the 53-week period ended on October 1, 2004. On June 14, 2004, our Board of Directors declared a two-for-one stock split in the form of a 100% stock dividend. The distribution of the shares was made on July 30, 2004 to stockholders of record as of June 30, 2004. Unless otherwise stated, all references to the number of shares and per share amounts of our common stock have been retroactively restated to reflect the increased number of shares resulting from the two-for-one split. Discussion of Financial Data for Fiscal Years ended 2006, 2005 and 2004 Total Revenues Revenues by sales classification Fiscal Years (Dollars in millions) 2006 % Change 2005 % Change 2004 Product $ 1,342 16 % $ 1,162 10 % $ 1,059 Service Contracts and Other 256 16 % 221 25 % 177 Total Revenues $ 1,598 16 % $ 1,383 12 % $ 1,236 Product as a percentage of total revenues 84 % 84 % 86 % Service Contracts and Other as a percentage of total revenues 16 % 16 % 14 % Revenues by region North America $ 807 11 % $ 730 5 % $ 693 Europe 450 17 % 385 20 % 319 Asia 255 23 % 208 16 % 179 Rest of world 86 44 % 60 35 % 45 Total International(1) 791 21 % 653 20 % 543 Total $ 1,598 16 % $ 1,383 12 % $ 1,236 North America as a percentage of total revenues 51 % 53 % 56 % International as a percentage of total revenues 49 % 47 % 44 % (1) We consider international revenues to be revenues outside of North America. Total revenues increased in fiscal years 2006 and 2005 over the respective prior years primarily due to increases in Oncology Systems revenues in each year, although X-ray Products business segment and the Other category also contributed to the increases. Increase in total revenues in fiscal years 2006 and 2005 over the prior year periods was primarily due to the growth in product revenues, and to a lesser extent, increase in service contracts and other revenues. Service contracts and other revenues grew less in fiscal year 2006 from fiscal year 2005 than in fiscal year 50 Table of Contents 2005 from fiscal year 2004. Oncology Systems service contracts revenues continued to comprise the vast bulk of total service contracts and other revenues, as well as being the primary contributor to the increase in total service contracts and other revenues, in each of fiscal years 2006 and 2005 over the respective prior years. International revenue growth exceeded the North American revenue growth in fiscal years 2006 and 2005 over the respective prior years. North American revenue growth in fiscal year 2006 over fiscal year 2005 was higher than the North American revenue growth in fiscal year 2005 over fiscal year 2004. Oncology Systems revenue growth was the primary contributor to the increases in revenues in all geographic regions in fiscal years 2006 and 2005, although X-ray Products revenue growth also contributed to the revenue increase in all regions. Oncology Systems Revenues Revenues by sales classification Fiscal Years (Dollars in millions) 2006 % Change 2005 % Change 2004 Product $ 1,088 16 % $ 942 9 % $ 867 Service Contracts(1) 248 16 % 214 25 % 172 Total Oncology Systems $ 1,336 16 % $ 1,156 11 % $ 1,039 Product as a percentage of Oncology Systems revenues 81 % 81 % 83 % Service Contracts as a percentage of Oncology Systems revenues 19 % 19 % 17 % Oncology Systems revenues as a percentage of total revenues 84 % 84 % 84 % (1) Revenues from service contracts represent revenues from fixed-term service contracts and labor cost services. This excludes revenues from spare parts sold by our service department. Oncology Systems total revenues in fiscal year 2006 increased 16% from fiscal year 2005, primarily due to increase in product revenues. The increase in Oncology Systems product revenues in fiscal year 2006 from fiscal year 2005 was primarily due to higher sales volume of accessory products that enable IMRT and IGRT (including our OBI) and our Trilogy linear accelerators, and to a lesser extent, higher sales volume of our software and brachytherapy products. The increase in service contracts revenues in fiscal year 2006 from fiscal year 2005 was primarily driven by the increase in sophistication of our products and the success of our software products which generate annual maintenance contracts and renewals. However, service contracts revenues in fiscal year 2006 grew at a lower rate and in absolute amount than fiscal year 2005. The lower growth rate in fiscal year 2006 over fiscal year 2005 was primarily due to the unusually high growth of the radiotherapy equipment service business of Mitsubishi Electric Co., or MELCO, in fiscal year 2005, from which we derived the first full year of revenue since the acquisition of MELCO radiotherapy equipment service business in February 2004. The majority of the 11% growth in total revenues for Oncology Systems business segment in fiscal year 2005 over fiscal year 2004 came from increased product revenues. The increase from Oncology Systems product revenues from fiscal year 2004 to fiscal year 2005 was primarily driven by higher sales volumes of our new accessory products that enable IMRT and IGRT, including our OBI and PortalVision products, which was stronger in the second half of fiscal year 2005. In addition, higher sales volume of our linear accelerators, including the Trilogy accelerators, contributed to a significant portion of Oncology Systems product revenues growth. Service contracts revenues grew faster than product revenues for fiscal year 2005 over fiscal year 2004. Service contracts revenues increased in fiscal year 2005 over fiscal year 2004 primarily due to the increase in sophistication of our products and the success of our software products which generate annual maintenance contracts and renewals. The acquisition of MELCO Service Business also contributed to the growth in service contracts revenues in fiscal year 2005. 51 Table of Contents Revenues by region Fiscal Years (Dollars in millions) 2006 % Change 2005 % Change 2004 North America $ 705 10 % $ 643 4 % $ 621 Europe 404 18 % 344 20 % 285 Asia 148 28 % 116 24 % 93 Rest of world 79 47 % 53 35 % 40 Total International 631 23 % 513 23 % 418 Total Oncology Systems $ 1,336 16 % $ 1,156 11 % $ 1,039 North America as a percentage of Oncology Systems revenues 53 % 56 % 60 % International as a percentage of Oncology Systems revenues 47 % 44 % 40 % All of our geographic regions contributed to the increase in Oncology Systems revenues for fiscal years 2006 and 2005 over the respective prior years. Oncology Systems continued to benefit from strong cyclical demand in the international regions that started a few years ago driven by the adoption of IMRT and the underserved medical needs outside of the United States after several years of very slow international revenue growth. In fiscal year 2006, our North American region returned to the normal long-term growth pattern of 10% to 15% due to growth in demand for our new products for IGRT. In fiscal year 2005, Oncology Systems revenues from North American region grew modestly at 4% after several years of strong revenue growth. We believe that the rapid adoption rate of IMRT was the primarily driver for the strong revenue growth in the earlier periods. By fiscal year 2005, as IMRT had become more of an established treatment technology and prior to growth in demand for IGRT products, we experienced the inevitable lower growth rate in fiscal year 2005 in the market for radiotherapy capital equipment, particularly equipment for IMRT. The offsetting cycle of higher and lower growth between the international and North American regions is a historical pattern that we continue to experience and is consistent with the net orders growth patterns discussed more fully in the Net Orders . North American revenues increased 10% in fiscal year 2006 compared to fiscal year 2005, primarily due to the higher sales volume of accessory products that enable IGRT (including our OBI) and our Trilogy linear accelerators. Revenues in North America grew a modest 4% in fiscal year 2005 over fiscal year 2004 due to the slowdown in the market for products that enable IMRT. International Oncology Systems revenues grew 23% in both fiscal years 2006 and 2005 over their respective prior years, primarily due to the increases in accessory products (including products that enable IGRT and IMRT and software products), as well as service contracts revenues, driven by the underserved medical needs in Europe and Asia. The growth in international revenues in fiscal year 2005 over fiscal year 2004 was also due in part to (i) increased revenues from the radiotherapy equipment service business of MELCO, (ii) the acquisition of Sigma Micro Informatique Conseil, and (iii) the relative weakness of the U.S. dollar for most of fiscal year 2005 that effectively made our pricing more competitive with our foreign competitors. 52 Table of Contents X-ray Products Revenues Revenues by region Fiscal Years (Dollars in millions) 2006 % Change 2005 % Change 2004 North America $ 88 19 % $ 74 29 % $ 57 Europe 28 4 % 27 26 % 22 Asia 105 20 % 88 7 % 82 Rest of world 7 17 % 6 38 % 4 Total International 140 16 % 121 12 % 108 Total X-ray Products $ 228 17 % $ 195 18 % $ 165 North America as a percentage of X-ray Products revenues 38 % 38 % 35 % International as a percentage of X-ray Products revenues 62 % 62 % 65 % X-ray Products revenues as a percentage of total revenues 14 % 14 % 13 % X-ray Products revenues increased by 17% and 18% in fiscal years 2006 and 2005, over the respective prior years. All of our geographic regions contributed to the increase in X-ray Products revenues for fiscal years 2006 and 2005. The growth in X-ray Products revenues in fiscal year 2006 over the prior year was primarily driven by higher sales volume of our flat panel detectors to our OEM customers in Asia and North America, and to a lesser extent, increased sales volumes of our high power, anode grounded CT scanning tubes primarily to one OEM customer and X-ray tubes used in security screening. The growth in X-ray Products revenues in fiscal year 2005 over fiscal year 2004 was primarily driven by higher sales volume of our flat panel detectors in North America, as well as increased sales volume of our high power, anode grounded CT scanning tubes primarily to one OEM customer. Other Revenues Revenues by sales classification Fiscal Years (Dollars in millions) 2006 % Change 2005 % Change 2004 Product $ 26 3 % $ 25 (4 )% $ 26 Service Contracts and Other 8 19 % 7 27 % 6 Total Other $ 34 6 % $ 32 1 % $ 32 Other revenues as a percentage of total revenues 2 % 2 % 3 % For our Other category, which is now comprised of SIP and GTC, revenues increased 6% for fiscal year 2006 over fiscal year 2005, primarily due to higher sales volume of our Linatron products to our OEM customers for cargo screening and border protection. The 1% increase of revenues in fiscal year 2005 over fiscal year 2004 was attributable to higher service contracts revenues due to a higher installed base of our Linatron products, partially offset by a slight decrease in product sales volume of SIP products for cargo screening than in fiscal year 2004. Orders and revenues for our SIP products may be unpredictable as government agencies may place larger orders with our OEM customers in a short time period and then may not place any orders for a long time period thereafter. 53 Table of Contents Gross Margin Fiscal Years (Dollars in millions) 2006 % Change 2005 % Change 2004 Dollar by segment Oncology Systems $ 573 12 % $ 512 14 % $ 449 X-ray Products 80 18 % 67 19 % 56 Other 10 (26 )% 14 12 % 13 Gross margin $ 663 12 % $ 593 14 % $ 518 Percentage by segment Oncology Systems 42.9 % 44.3 % 43.2 % X-ray Products 34.9 % 34.6 % 34.3 % Total Company 41.5 % 42.9 % 41.9 % Total gross margin decreased by 1.4 percentage points in fiscal year 2006 compared to fiscal year 2005 due primarily to a decrease in gross margin in the Oncology Systems business segment and the inclusion of share-based compensation expense in connection with our adoption of SFAS 123(R), partially offset by a slight increase in X-ray Products gross margin. In fiscal year 2005, both of our business segments and the Other category contributed to the one percentage point increase in total gross margin from fiscal year 2004, although the increase in total gross margin was primarily due to an increase in the Oncology Systems gross margin. Total gross margin of 42.9% in fiscal year 2005 was the highest achieved annual gross margin since we became a standalone medical systems company in 1999. Total product gross margin was 41.2% in fiscal year 2006, compared to 43.0% and 42.9% in fiscal years 2005 and 2004, respectively. Total service contracts and other gross margin was 43.4% in fiscal year 2006, compared to 42.3% and 36.6% in fiscal years 2005 and 2004, respectively. Oncology Systems gross margin decreased in fiscal year 2006 compared to the prior year, primarily due to a decrease in product gross margin to 42.7% in fiscal year 2006 from 44.7% in fiscal year 2005, partially offset by increase in service contracts gross margin to 44.1% in fiscal year 2006 from 42.3% in fiscal year 2005. The decrease in product gross margin was primarily due to: (i) higher ramp-up costs and higher proportion of revenue associated with our new products for IGRT; (ii) share-based compensation expense of $5.1 million recorded in fiscal year 2006 in the Oncology Systems segment in connection with our adoption of SFAS 123(R); and (iii). a continuing mix shift towards a higher proportion of international revenues which typically have lower gross margins than revenues from North America. The improvement in service contracts gross margin was due primarily to higher volumes and growth in higher margin software maintenance contracts in Oncology Systems. Oncology Systems gross margin increased by 1.1 percentage points in fiscal year 2005 from fiscal year 2004. Oncology Systems product gross margin increased slightly to 44.7% in fiscal year 2005 from 44.5% in fiscal year 2004 due primarily to higher average selling price, lower product costs, lower warranty costs as a result of improved product engineering and design and partially offset by continuing shift to lower margin international revenues. Service contracts gross margin in Oncology Systems showed strong performance and increased significantly to 42.3% in fiscal year 2005 compared to 36.6% in fiscal year 2004 due primarily to higher volumes and growth in higher margin software maintenance contracts in Oncology Systems. X-ray Products gross margin in fiscal year 2006 increased slightly by 0.3 percentage points from fiscal year 2005. The gain in gross margin resulting from increased sales of our higher gross margin flat panel detectors was significantly offset by product mix shift toward lower gross margin X-ray tube products and increased share-based compensation expense of $1.4 million in the X-ray Products segment. X-ray Products gross margin in fiscal year 2005 also increased slightly by 0.3 percentage points from fiscal year 2004 due to significant gross margin gains from the increasing sales volume of our flat panel detectors, 54 Table of Contents partially offset by higher raw material costs and manufacturing costs associated with X-ray tube. We believe that the gross margin in X-ray Products segment will be positively impacted if a higher proportion of X-ray Products revenues are derived from flat panel detectors. Research and Development Fiscal Years (Dollars in millions) 2006 % Change 2005 % Change 2004 Research and development $ 100 22 % $ 82 14 % $ 72 As a percentage of total revenues 6 % 6 % 6 % We have maintained our research and development expenses at 6% of total revenues, in line with our revenue growth. The $18 million increase in research and development expenses for fiscal year 2006 was driven by increased spending of $11 million in Oncology Systems, $4 million in the Other category and $3 million in X-ray Products. Our research and development efforts in Oncology Systems in fiscal year 2006 were focused on the development of next generation products and accessories, specifically our next generation linear accelerator, other technology such as IGRT, our Monte Carlo and dose calculation algorithms for our treatment planning software products and our new electronic health records within our information management software. We anticipate that we will continue to devote significant resources to research and development in the future. The $11 million increase in research and development expenses in Oncology Systems for fiscal year 2006 compared to fiscal year 2005 was attributable primarily to: (a) increased employee headcount, materials costs and consulting expenses totaling $10.5 million for the development of our next generation linear accelerator products and (b) increased share-based compensation expense of $2.0 million recorded in fiscal year 2006. These increases were partially offset by favorable foreign currency impact of $0.9 million in fiscal year 2006 resulting from the relatively strong U.S. dollar for our foreign operations as the research and development expenses are translated into U.S. dollars. The $3 million increase in X-ray Products was due to: (a) increased expenses totaling $2.7 million for new research and development projects related to both X-ray tubes and flat panel detectors and (b) share-based compensation expense of $0.7 million recorded in fiscal year 2006. The $4 million increase in the Other category was primarily due to: (a) increased expenses totaling $2.0 million for research and development of the Linatron product line and (b) share-based compensation expense of $1.6 million recorded in fiscal year 2006. The $10 million increase in research and development expenses for fiscal year 2005 over fiscal year 2004 was primarily driven by increased spending of $9.1 million in Oncology Systems. The increase in absolute dollars in research and development expenses in Oncology Systems for fiscal year 2005 compared to fiscal year 2004 was attributable primarily to: a) increased employee headcount, materials costs and consulting expenses of $6.1 million in total; b) increased expenses of $1.0 million related to the new projects from the acquisition of Sigma Micro; and c) increased expenses of $1.0 million resulting from the relatively weak U.S. dollar in most of fiscal year 2005 for our foreign operations as the research and development expenses are translated into U.S. dollars. Selling, General and Administrative Fiscal Years (Dollars in millions) 2006 % Change 2005 % Change 2004 Selling, general and administrative $ 254 23 % $ 206 9 % $ 189 As a percentage of total revenues 16 % 15 % 15 % Our selling, general and administrative expenses have remained relatively in line with our revenue growth, despite the share-based compensation expense we recorded in fiscal year 2006 in connection with our adoption of SFAS 123(R) in fiscal year 2006. The $48 million increase in selling, general and 55 Table of Contents administrative expenses for fiscal year 2006 compared to fiscal year 2005 was primarily attributable to: (a) increased share-based compensation expense of $28.7 million recorded for fiscal year 2006, (b) increased employee-related expenses of $14.9 million resulting from an increase in employee headcount and other associated costs in Oncology Systems and corporate headquarters to support our growing business activities, (c) increased professional fees of $2.7 million largely driven by information technology projects and (d) decreased income on equity investment in dpiX Holding of $2.0 million (see Note 4 Related Party Transactions in Notes to the Consolidated Financial Statements) and (e) increased fees of $1.5 million related to certain non-employee related commission arrangements. These increases were partially offset by (i) a gain on balance sheet hedging of $3.1 million, (ii) a decrease in accounting fees of approximately $1.7 million primarily due to the unusually high expenses in fiscal year 2005 related to compliance with the required documentation and testing of internal control over financial reporting as mandated by the Sarbanes-Oxley Act of 2002 and (iii) favorable foreign currency translation impact of $1.7 million resulting from the relatively strong U.S. dollar for our foreign operations as the selling, general and administrative expenses are translated into U.S. dollars. The increase in selling, general and administrative expenses for fiscal year 2005 compared to fiscal year 2004 was attributable primarily to: a) increased net employee-related expenses of $7.0 million, which included an increase of $13.8 million resulting from an increase in employee headcount in Oncology Systems, corporate headquarters and X-ray Products to support our growing business activities, partially offset by a $6.8 million decrease in employee and management incentive plans; b) increased incremental expenses of $4.5 million related to compliance with the required documentation and testing of internal control over financial reporting as mandated by the Sarbanes-Oxley Act of 2002; c) increased operating expenses of $2.9 million related to acquisitions; d) increased expenses of $2.6 million related to our information systems and e) increased expenses of $1.8 million resulting from the relatively weak U.S. dollar in most of fiscal year 2005 for our foreign operations as the selling, general and administrative expenses are translated into U.S. dollars. These increases were partially offset by (i) increased income on equity investment in dpiX Holding of $3.4 million and (ii) decreased fees of $2.6 million related to certain commission arrangements. Interest Income, Net Fiscal Years (Dollars in millions) 2006 % Change 2005 % Change 2004 Interest income, net $ 9.3 178 % $ 3.4 157 % $ 1.3 The increase in interest income, net in fiscal year 2006 compared to fiscal year 2005 was attributable to an increase in interest rates in fiscal year 2006. The increase in interest income, net in fiscal year 2005 compared to fiscal year 2004 was attributable to an increase in interest rates in fiscal year 2005 over fiscal year 2004, partly offset by decreases in the levels of cash, cash equivalents and marketable securities between fiscal years 2004 and 2005. Taxes on Earnings Fiscal Years 2006 Change 2005 Change 2004 Effective tax rate 24 % (9 )% 33 % (2 )% 35 % The decrease in the effective tax rates in fiscal year 2006 from fiscal year 2005 was primarily due to tax benefits related to (i) the repatriation of foreign earnings under the American Jobs Creation of 2004 (the Jobs Creation Act ), which resulted in a decrease in our effective tax rate of approximately four percentage points, (ii) a deferred tax asset adjustment for certain prior years state and federal temporary differences, which resulted a decrease in our effective tax rate of approximately two 56 Table of Contents percentage points, (iii) the reduction of reserves for potential tax contingencies as a result of the lapse of the statute of limitations in certain domestic jurisdictions, which resulted in a one percentage point decrease in our effective tax rate and a shift in the geographic mix of earnings towards countries with lower tax rates, which resulted in a decrease in our effective tax rate of approximately three percentage points in fiscal year 2006 over fiscal year 2005. The Jobs Creation Act introduced a special one-time dividends received deduction on the repatriation of foreign earnings. During fiscal year 2006, we repatriated approximately $128 million in foreign earnings pursuant to the Jobs Creation Act. We had previously recorded a deferred tax liability of approximately $17 million for taxes for the eventual repatriation of a portion of our foreign earnings. Under the Jobs Creation Act, our tax liability for repatriation of the approximately $128 million in foreign earnings is expected to be $5 million. Therefore, we recorded a net tax benefit of approximately $12 million. We also recorded a net tax benefit of $7.2 million in fiscal year 2006 related to adjustments of certain prior years state and federal temporary differences. In addition, a tax benefit of approximately $3 million recorded in fiscal year 2006 was related to the reduction of reserves for potential tax contingencies as a result of the lapse of the statute of limitations in certain domestic jurisdictions. The decrease in effective tax rate in fiscal year 2005 from fiscal year 2004 was primarily due to a shift of earnings towards countries with lower statutory rates. In general, our effective income tax rate differs from the U.S. federal statutory rate largely as a result of foreign income taxed at rates lower than the U.S. federal rate, state income taxes and, the extraterritorial income exclusion. Our future effective tax rate could be adversely affected by earnings being lower than anticipated in countries where we have lower statutory rates and higher than anticipated in countries where we have higher statutory rates, by changes in the valuation of our deferred tax assets or liabilities, or changes in tax laws or interpretations thereof. Net Earnings Per Diluted Share Fiscal Years 2006 % Change 2005 % Change 2004 Net earnings per diluted share $ 1.81 21 % $ 1.50 27 % $ 1.18 The increase in earnings per diluted share in fiscal year 2006 from fiscal year 2005 can be attributed to the increase in total revenues, the reduction in effective tax rate and the reduction in outstanding shares of common stock due to stock repurchases. Net earnings per diluted share increased in fiscal year 2006 from fiscal year 2005 by $0.31. These results include incremental share-based compensation expenses of $0.20 per diluted share related to our adoption of SFAS 123(R). The incremental share-based compensation expenses were partially offset by a one-time tax benefit of $0.09 per diluted share related to the repatriation of foreign earnings under the Jobs Creation Act, a net tax benefit of $0.05 per diluted share related adjustments of certain prior years state and federal temporary differences and a $0.01 per diluted share related to the release of a reserve for certain contingencies associated with the sale of our Electron Device Business in 1995, which was classified as earnings from discontinued operations, net of taxes, in the Consolidation Statement of Earnings. The increase in earnings per diluted share in fiscal year 2005 from fiscal year 2004 can be attributed to the increase in total revenues, improvements in gross margins, the reduction in effective tax rate and the reduction in outstanding shares of common stock due to stock repurchases. 57 Table of Contents Net Orders Total Net Orders (by segment and region) Fiscal Years (Dollars in millions) 2006 % Change 2005 % Change 2004 Oncology Systems: North America $ 861 19 % $ 722 3 % $ 700 Total International 674 6 % 633 31 % 483 Total Oncology Systems $ 1,535 13 % $ 1,355 15 % $ 1,183 X-ray Products: North America $ 111 45 % $ 76 28 % $ 59 Total International 131 3 % 128 3 % 125 Total X-ray Products $ 242 19 % $ 204 11 % $ 184 Other: $ 43 33 % $ 32 4 % $ 31 Total Net Orders $ 1,820 14 % $ 1,591 14 % $ 1,398 The increase in our total net orders for fiscal year 2006 over fiscal year 2005 was primarily due to the 13% increase in Oncology Systems net orders. In fiscal year 2006, North American Oncology Systems net orders grew 19% from fiscal year 2005 compared to 3% and 11% in fiscal years 2005 and 2004, respectively, from the respective prior fiscal years. The growth in North American net orders reflected increased demand for our new accessory products that enable IGRT (including our OBI) and for the Trilogy linear accelerators. We believe Oncology Systems is experiencing its strongest growth in North America as this region adopts IGRT technology. After several years of strong growth driven by the rapid adoption of IMRT technology, international net orders increased modestly by 6% in fiscal year 2006, compared to 31%, 36% and 30% in fiscal years 2005, 2004 and 2003 over the respective year earlier periods. Consistent with what we saw in North America, we expect rates of growth to lower following a rapid IMRT adoption cycle and as IMRT becomes an established treatment methodology in the international regions. We are however also beginning to see, to a limited extent, demand for our new accessory products that enable IGRT (including our OBI) as these international regions enter the initial stages of adoption of IGRT. We expect that IGRT will continue to be one of the main contributors to net orders and revenues growth in our Oncology Systems business segment, with North America ahead of international regions in the timing of adoption. We continue to believe that Oncology Systems business segment can sustain global long-term growth of 10% to 15% due to fundamental market factors for growth in the radiation therapy market that we believe have remained unchanged. In any given period, however, orders growth in either North America or international regions, or both, could be outside of this range. The actual timing of sales and revenue recognition will vary significantly based on the delivery requirements of individual orders and the readiness of individual customer sites for installation of our products and are usually shorter for some types of orders, such as upgrades ( i.e. the addition of new features or accessories to existing equipment). Thus, orders in any quarter or period are not necessarily directly correlated to the level of sales or revenues in any particular future quarter or period. Moreover, as the overall mix of net orders includes a greater proportion of software products and newly introduced Oncology Systems products, which typically have longer time from order to completion of installation, the average time period within which orders convert into sales could lengthen and our deferred revenues may increase and margins may fall. The net orders growth in Oncology Systems also benefited from the growing demand of our software products for treatment planning and information management and our brachytherapy products. X-ray Products have relatively short turn around from net orders to shipments. X-ray Products net orders increased by 19% for fiscal year 2006 compared to fiscal year 2005 due to continuing robust demand for our flat panel detectors. After years of investment in flat panel technology, the flat panel 58 Table of Contents detector product line has become a significant contributor to our X-ray Products business segment. We believe the flat panel detector product line will continue to experience high growth as flat panel detectors which enable filmless X-ray imaging replace traditional X-ray products in many medical applications. Net orders in the Other category, comprised of SIP and GTC, increased by 33% in fiscal year 2006 compared to fiscal year 2005 primarily due to a substantial increase in orders from OEM customers for our Linatron X-ray accelerators for cargo screening and border protection. While we are optimistic about the long-term potential of our SIP business and encouraged by the increased interest in our products, use of this technology in security cargo screening and border protection is in its early stages and governmental agencies have provided limited public information about plans for adopting such technologies. Orders for our SIP products may be unpredictable as governmental agencies may place larger orders with our OEM customers in a short time period and then may not place any orders for a long time period thereafter. The actual timing of sales and revenue recognition will vary significantly as it is difficult to predict our customer delivery and acceptance schedules. Thus, orders in any quarter or period are not necessarily directly correlated to the level of sales or revenues in any particular future quarter or period. Backlog At September 29, 2006, we had a backlog of $1.4 billion, an increase of 19% compared to September 30, 2005. Our Oncology Systems backlog at September 29, 2006 increased by 18% from September 30, 2005, including a 27% increase for North America and a 6% increase for international regions. Liquidity and Capital Resources Liquidity is the measurement of our ability to meet potential cash requirements, including ongoing commitments to repay borrowings, acquire businesses and fund continuing operations. Our sources of cash include operations, stock option exercises and employee stock purchases, borrowings and interest income. Our cash usage is actively managed on a daily basis to ensure the maintenance of sufficient funds to meet our needs. Cash, Cash Equivalents and Marketable Securities The following table summarizes our cash, cash equivalents and marketable securities: (In millions) September 29, 2006 September 30, 2005 Increase/ (Decrease) Cash, cash equivalents and marketable securities: Cash and cash equivalents $ 272 $ 243 $ 29 Marketable securities 94 139 (45 ) Total $ 366 $ 382 $ (16 ) The net decrease in cash and cash equivalents and marketable securities during fiscal year 2006 was primarily a result of using cash and cash proceeds from maturities of marketable securities for the repurchase of common stock of $271 million, capital expenditures of $41 million, investment in dpiX Holding of $12 million for the construction of a manufacturing facility in Colorado, employee tax payments of $8 million against 162,288 withheld shares in connection with restricted performance share awards and restricted common stock vested, contribution of $5 million to the trust assets of our deferred compensation plan, which invests in corporate-owned life insurance contracts. All of these decreases were significantly offset by $202 million cash generated from operating activities, $74 million of cash provided by the issuance of common stock related to stock option exercises and employee stock purchases and $52 million of cash provided by the excess tax benefits from share-based compensation. 59 Table of Contents At September 29, 2006, we had approximately $191 million or 52% of total cash, cash equivalents and marketable securities in the United States. Approximately $175 million or 48% of total cash, cash equivalents and marketable securities was held abroad and could be subject to additional taxation if it were repatriated to the United States. In fiscal year 2006, we repatriated $128 million in foreign earnings pursuant to the Jobs Creation Act. Our tax liability for repatriation of the $128 million in foreign earnings was $5 million. Cash Flows Fiscal Years (In millions) 2006 2005 2004 Net cash flow provided by (used in): Operating activities $ 202 $ 252 $ 234 Investing activities (12 ) 52 (36 ) Financing activities (156 ) (195 ) (142 ) Effects of exchange rate changes on cash and cash equivalents (5 ) 1 (3 ) Net increase in cash and cash equivalents $ 29 $ 110 $ 53 Our primary cash inflows and outflows for fiscal years 2006, 2005 and 2004 were as follows: We generated net cash from operating activities of $202 million in fiscal year 2006, compared to $252 million and $234 million in fiscal years 2005 and 2004, respectively. In connection with our adoption of SFAS 123(R) in fiscal year 2006, we reported $52 million of excess tax benefits from shared based compensation as cash provided by financing activities, which was previously reported as cash provided by operating activities in fiscal years 2005 and 2004. The $50 million decrease in net cash from operating activities during fiscal year 2006 from 2005 was driven by a net change of $38 million in operating assets and liabilities (working capital items) and a net decrease in non-cash items of $51 million, partially offset by an increase in net earnings of $39 million. The major contributors to the net change in working capital items in fiscal year 2006 were accounts receivable, inventories, accrued expenses, deferred revenues and advance payments from customers. Accounts receivables increased due to higher revenues in fiscal year 2006 compared to the prior year and the continuing shift to a higher proportion of international deliveries, which typically have a longer collection cycle than North America and a longer period from shipment to revenue recognition. Inventories increased due to the continuing shift to a higher proportion of international deliveries, which typically have a longer period from shipment to cost recognition, as well as due to anticipated customer demands for both Oncology Systems and X-ray Products business segments. Accrued expenses increased primarily due to increase in income taxes payable. The increase in income taxes payable was the result of lower estimated tax payments made during fiscal year 2006. Deferred revenues increased due to increasing revenue recognition deferrals related to timing of completion of installation of our Oncology Systems products and our growing sales of new Oncology Systems products, as well as the higher proportion of our Oncology Systems business represented by international revenues with the accompanying longer period from shipment to revenue recognition. Advance payments from customers increased primarily due to increased orders. 60 Table of Contents The $18 million increase in cash flow from operating activities from fiscal years 2004 to 2005 was a result of an increase in net earnings of $39 million, partially offset by a net decrease of $13 million in non-cash items, net, due primarily to the decrease in tax benefits from employee stock option exercises and a net change of approximately $8 million in operating assets and liabilities (working capital items). The major contributors to the change in working capital items in fiscal year 2005 were accounts receivable, deferred revenues and inventories. Accounts receivable and inventories increased primarily due to the continuing shift to a higher proportion of international deliveries, which typically have a longer collection cycle than North America and a longer period from shipment to cost recognition. The increase in inventories was also due to anticipated customer demands for both Oncology Systems and X-ray Products. The increase in deferred revenues resulted from increasing revenue recognition deferrals related to timing of completion of installation of our software products and our growing sales of new products, as well as the higher international proportion of our Oncology Systems business with the accompanying longer period from shipment to revenue recognition. We expect that cash provided by operating activities may fluctuate in future periods as a result of a number of factors, including fluctuations in our operating results, timing of product shipments, accounts receivable collections, inventory management, and the timing of tax and other payments. For additional discussion, see Risk Factors in Item 1A. Investing activities used $12 million of net cash in fiscal year 2006, provided $52 million in fiscal year 2005 and used $36 million in fiscal year 2004. Our net proceeds from maturities of marketable securities were $45 million and $121 million, $67 million during fiscal years 2006, 2005 and 2004, respectively. Cash used for purchases of property, plant and equipment was $41 million in fiscal year 2006, compared to $44 million and $24 million in fiscal years 2005 and 2004, respectively. We also invested $12 million in dpiX Holding for the construction of a manufacturing facility in Colorado. We did not acquire any businesses during fiscal year 2006, compared to using cash of $12 million and $72 million in fiscal years 2005 and 2004, respectively, for that purpose. Financing activities used net cash of $156 million in fiscal year 2006 compared to $195 million and $142 million in fiscal years 2005 and 2004, respectively. In fiscal year 2006, we used $271 million for the repurchase of common stock, $8 million (the value of withheld shares) for employees taxes due when restricted performance share awards and restricted common stock vested and $3 million for repayment of bank borrowings. These uses were partially offset by cash proceeds of $74 million from employee stock option exercises and employee stock purchases and $52 million in excess tax benefits from share-based compensation. In fiscal year 2005, we used $227 million for repurchases of common stock and $5 million for repayment of bank borrowings and received proceeds of $38 million from stock option exercises and employee stock purchases. In fiscal year 2004, we used $202 million for repurchases of common stock and received $46 million in proceeds from stock option exercises and employee stock purchases. We expect our capital expenditures, which typically represent construction and/or purchases of facilities, manufacturing equipment, office equipment and furniture and fixtures, will be approximately 4% of revenues in fiscal year 2007. Our liquidity is affected by many factors, some of which result from the normal ongoing operations of our business and some of which arise from uncertainties and conditions in the United States and global economies. Although our cash requirements will fluctuate as a result of the shifting influences of these factors, we believe that existing cash and cash equivalents and cash to be generated from operations will be sufficient to satisfy anticipated commitments for capital expenditures and other cash requirements through fiscal year 2007. We currently anticipate that we will continue to utilize our strong liquidity and cash flows from operations to repurchase our common stock, make strategic acquisitions, invest in the growth of our business and invest in systems and processes. 61 Table of Contents Days Sales Outstanding Trade accounts receivable days sales outstanding, or DSO, were 94 days at September 29, 2006 compared to 82 days at September 30, 2005. Our accounts receivable and DSO are primarily impacted by timing of product shipments, collections performance and payment terms. The increase in DSO for fiscal year 2006 over fiscal year 2005 was related to our growing sales of new products and the continuing shift to a higher proportion of international sales, which typically have a longer collection cycle than North America. Stock Repurchase Program During fiscal years 2006, 2005 and 2004, we paid $271 million, $227 million and $202 million, respectively, to repurchase 5,395,100 shares, 5,960,000 shares and 5,576,000 shares, respectively, of our common stock under various Board of Directors authorizations. All shares that have been repurchased have been retired. As of September 29, 2006, 1,500,000 shares of our common stock remained available for repurchase under an authorization that expires on December 31, 2006. On November 20, 2006, we announced that our Board of Directors had approved the repurchase of an additional 4.5 million shares of our common stock over the period prior to September 28, 2007. Contractual Obligations The following summarizes our contractual obligations as of September 29, 2006 and the effect such obligations are expected to have on our liquidity and cash flows in future periods: Payments Due By Period (In millions) Fiscal Year 2007 Fiscal Years 2008 - 2009 Fiscal Years 2010 - 2011 Beyond Total Long term debt(1) $ 7.9 $ 17.0 $ 14.5 $ 17.9 $ 57.3 Interest obligation on long term debt 3.8 5.9 3.5 1.6 14.8 Operating Leases(2) 11.5 15.9 8.1 6.1 41.6 Mandatorily redeemable instrument(3) 12.1 12.1 Investment in dpiX Holding(4) 24.5 24.5 Total $ 59.8 $ 38.8 $ 26.1 $ 25.6 $ 150.3 (1) At September 29, 2006, we had long term debt of $57.3 million. Long-term debt, including current maturities, decreased $2.7 million from September 30, 2005 due to principal repayments of $2.7 million. The fixed interest rates on the outstanding debt on this date ranged from 6.70% to 7.58% with a weighted average interest rate of 6.88%. As of September 29, 2006, land and buildings with a carrying amount of $9.9 million were pledged as collateral against certain loans we assumed related to purchases of land and buildings in Las Vegas. The remaining unsecured loan agreements contain a covenant that requires us to pay prepayment penalties if we elect to pay off this debt before the maturity dates and the market interest rate is lower than the fixed interest rates of the debt at the time of repayment. It also contains covenants that limit future borrowings and cash dividend payments and require us to maintain specified levels of working capital and operating results. During fiscal years 2004, 2005 and 2006, the Company was in compliance with all restrictive covenants of the unsecured term loan agreements. (2) We lease office space and have entered into other lease commitments in North America as well as various locations in Europe, Asia, Australia and Latin America. Operating leases include future minimum lease payments under all our noncancelable operating leases as of September 29, 2006. (3) Following a decision by Mitsubishi Electric Co., or MELCO, to exit the radiotherapy equipment and service business and its desire to do so in a nondisruptive manner with an established radiotherapy equipment service provider, we entered into two separate transactions with MELCO contemporaneously whereby (i) we purchased MELCO radiotherapy equipment service business 62 Table of Contents to service MELCO existing customers and (ii) we formed a three-year joint venture, or JVA, in Japan with MELCO that was effective as of February 3, 2004. The joint venture was accomplished through MELCO purchase on February 3, 2004, of a 35% ownership interest in our Japanese subsidiary, VMS KK, for 1.4 billion Japanese Yen, or US$13.5 million. At the end of the JVA period, MELCO is required to unconditionally sell and we are required to unconditionally repurchase MELCO 35% ownership interest in VMS KK at the original price (1.4 billion Japanese Yen). The Company has accounted for MELCO 35% ownership interest as a mandatorily redeemable financial instrument, which is included in Accrued expenses and Other long-term liabilities in the Consolidated Balance Sheets, as of September 29, 2006 and September 30, 2005, respectively. The mandatorily redeemable financial instrument amounted to US$12.1 million and US$12.5 million as of September 29, 2006 and September 30, 2005, respectively. In addition, MELCO is also eligible for a contingent earn out payment at the end of the JVA period, which represents 100% of the net profits or losses of the radiotherapy equipment service business during the three-year JVA period. For the period from February 2, 2004 to September 29, 2006, net profits for the radiotherapy equipment service business totaled approximately $3.6 million, which would be payable to MELCO at the end of the JVA period assuming the business did not generate any future profits and losses. For further discussion regarding these two transactions with MELCO, see Note 2 Balance Sheet Components and Note 8 Commitments and Contingencies of the Notes to the Consolidated Financial Statements. (4) As of September 29, 2006, through an investment in a consortium, dpiX Holding LLC, or dpiX Holding, we held an indirect ownership interest of 38.4% in dpiX LLC, or dpiX. In March 2006, we and the other member of dpix Holding agreed in principle to invest an aggregate of $92 million in dpiX Holding for dpiX to acquire and construct a manufacturing facility in Colorado to increase its production capacity. The members contributions for this facility are based on their percentage of ownership interest in dpiX Holding. As of September 29, 2006, we had contributed approximately $12 million to dpiX Holding related to this manufacturing facility and expect to invest an additional $25 million over the next 12 months. For further discussion regarding these transactions, see Note 4 Related Party Transactions of the Notes to the Consolidated Financial Statements. Total debt as a percentage of total capital decreased to 8.0% at September 29, 2006 compared to 9.9% at September 30, 2005 largely due to the increases in retained earnings and capital in excess of par value during fiscal year 2006. The ratio of current assets to current liabilities decreased to 1.80 to 1 at September 29, 2006 from 1.87 to 1 at September 30, 2005. Contingencies We are subject to a variety of environmental laws around the world regulating the handling, storage, transport and disposal of hazardous materials that do or may create increased costs for some of our operations. Although we follow procedures that we consider appropriate under existing regulations, these procedures can be costly and we cannot completely eliminate the risk of contamination or injury from these materials, and, in the event of such an incident, we could be held liable for any damages that result. In addition, we could be assessed fines or penalties for failure to comply with environmental laws and regulations. These costs, and any future violations or liability under environmental laws or regulations, could have a material adverse effect on our business. In addition, we may be required to incur significant additional costs to comply with future changes in existing environmental laws and regulations or new laws and regulations. For example, several countries, including many in the European Union, or EU, are requiring medical equipment manufacturers to bear some or all of the cost of product disposal at the end of the products useful life, thus creating increased costs for our operations. The EU has also adopted a directive that may require the adoption of 63 Table of Contents restrictions on the use of some hazardous substances in certain of our products sold in the EU. This directive could create increased costs for our operations. From the time we began operating, we handled and disposed of hazardous materials and wastes following procedures that were considered appropriate under regulations, if any, existing at the time. We also hired companies to dispose of wastes generated by our operations. The U.S. Environmental Protection Agency, or EPA, or third parties have named us as a potentially responsible party, or PRP, under the Comprehensive Environmental Response Compensation and Liability Act of 1980, as amended, or CERCLA, at eight sites where we, as Varian Associates, Inc., are alleged to have shipped such wastes for recycling or disposal, and as a PRP we may have an obligation to reimburse the EPA or other third parties for cleanup costs at these sites. In addition, we are overseeing environmental cleanup projects and, as applicable, reimbursing third parties for cleanup activities under the direction of, or in consultation with, federal, state and/or local agencies at certain current VMS or former Varian Associates, Inc. facilities (including facilities disposed of in connection with our sale of our Electron Devices business during 1995 and the sale of our thin film systems business during 1997). Under the terms of the agreement governing the distribution of the shares, or the spin-offs, of Varian, Inc., or VI, and Varian Semiconductor Equipment Associates, Inc., or VSEA, by us in 1999, VI and VSEA are each obligated to indemnify us for one-third of these environmental cleanup costs (after adjusting for any insurance proceeds realized or tax benefits recognized by us). As described below, we have accrued a total of $15.5 million at September 29, 2006 to cover our liabilities for these cleanup projects. Various uncertainties make it difficult to estimate the likelihood or cost of certain third-party claims, project management costs and legal costs at all of the sites and facilities. In addition, for these eight sites and one of these facilities, various uncertainties make it difficult to assess the likelihood and scope of further cleanup activities or to estimate the future costs of such activities. As of September 29, 2006, we nonetheless estimated that our future exposure (net of VI and VSEA indemnification obligations) for these cleanup costs, third-party claims, project management costs and legal costs ranged in the aggregate from $3.6 million to $7.2 million. The time frames over which these cleanup project costs are estimated vary, ranging from one year to 14 years as of September 29, 2006. We believe that no amount in the foregoing range of estimated future costs is more probable of being incurred than any other amount in such range and therefore accrued $3.6 million as of September 29, 2006. The amount accrued has not been discounted to present value due to the uncertainties that make it difficult to develop a best estimate of future costs. As to all other facilities, we have gained sufficient knowledge to better estimate the scope and costs of future cleanup activities based upon formal agreements with other parties defining our future liabilities or formal cleanup plans that have either been approved by or completed in accordance with the requirements of the state or federal environmental agency with jurisdiction over the facility. As of September 29, 2006, we estimated that the our future exposure (net of VI and VSEA indemnification obligations) for the cleanup costs at these facilities, and reimbursements of third-party claims for these facilities, ranged in the aggregate from $9.8 million to $36.4 million. The time frames over which these cleanup project costs are estimated vary with each facility, ranging from 2 years to 30 years as of September 29, 2006. As to each of these facilities, management determined that a particular amount within the range of estimated costs was a better estimate of the future environmental liability than any other amount within the range, and that the amount and timing of these future costs were reliably determinable. The best estimate within the range was $17.7 million at September 29, 2006. We accordingly accrued $11.9 million, which represents our best estimate of the future costs of $17.7 million discounted at 4%, net of inflation. 64 Table of Contents At September 29, 2006, our reserve for environmental liabilities, based upon future environmental related costs estimated as of that date, was calculated as follows: (In millions) Recurring Costs Non-Recurring Costs Total Anticipated Future Costs Fiscal Years: 2007 $ 0.7 $ 1.1 $ 1.8 2008 0.6 1.2 1.8 2009 0.7 0.6 1.3 2010 0.6 0.5 1.1 2011 0.6 0.4 1.0 Thereafter 11.6 2.7 14.3 Total costs $ 14.8 $ 6.5 21.3 Less imputed interest (5.8 ) Reserve amount $ 15.5 Recurring costs include expenses for such tasks as ongoing operation, maintenance and monitoring of cleanup while non-recurring costs include expenses for such tasks as soil excavation and treatment, injection/monitoring well installation and other costs for soil and groundwater in situ treatment by injection, ground and surface water treatment system construction, soil and groundwater investigation, certain governmental agency costs required to be reimbursed by us, governmental agency response costs (including agency costs required to be reimbursed by the responding company), treatment system and monitoring well removal and closure, and costs to defend against and settle pending and anticipated third-party claims. When we developed the estimates above, we considered the financial strength of other potentially responsible parties. These amounts are, however, only estimates and may be revised in the future as we get more information on these projects. We may also spend more or less than these estimates. Based on current information, we believe that our reserves are adequate, but as the scope of our obligations becomes more clearly defined, these reserves (and the associated indemnification obligations of VI and VSEA) may be modified and related charges/credits against earnings may be made. We receive certain cash payments in the form of settlements and judgments from defendants, our insurers and other third parties from time to time. We have also reached an agreement with an insurance company under which the insurance company has agreed to pay a portion of our past and future environmental-related expenditures, and we therefore had included a $3.0 million receivable in Other assets at September 29, 2006. We believe that this receivable is recoverable because it is based on a binding, written settlement agreement with a solvent and financially viable insurance company and the insurance company has in the past paid the claims that we have made. Our present and past facilities have been in operation for many years, and over that time in the course of those operations, these facilities have used substances, that are or might be considered hazardous, and we have generated and disposed of wastes, that are or might be considered hazardous. Therefore, it is possible that additional environmental issues may arise in the future that we cannot now predict. We are also involved, from time to time, in other legal proceedings, claims and government inspections or investigations, arising in the ordinary course of our business. Such matters are subject to many uncertainties and outcomes are not predictable with assurance. We accrue amounts that we believe are adequate to address any liabilities related to legal proceedings and other loss contingencies that we believe will result in a probable loss. While there can be no assurances as to the ultimate outcome of any legal proceeding or other loss contingency involving us, management does not believe any pending matter will be resolved in a manner that would have a material adverse effect on our consolidated 65 Table of Contents financial position, results of operations or cash flows. However, it is possible that a legal or other proceeding brought against us could have such an impact. Off-Balance Sheet Arrangements In conjunction with the sale of our products in the ordinary course of business, we provide standard indemnification of business partners and customers for losses suffered or incurred for patent, copyright or any other intellectual property infringement claims by any third parties with respect to our products. The term of these indemnification arrangements is generally perpetual. The maximum potential amount of future payments we could be required to make under these agreements is unlimited. As of September 29, 2006, we have not incurred any costs since the spin-offs to defend lawsuits or settle claims related to these indemnification arrangements. We have entered into indemnification agreements with our directors and officers that may require us to indemnify our directors and officers against liabilities that may arise by reason of their status or service as directors or officers, and to advance their expenses incurred as a result of any legal proceeding against them as to which they could be indemnified. Generally, the maximum obligation under such indemnifications is not explicitly stated and, as a result, the overall amount of these obligations cannot be reasonably estimated. Recent Accounting Pronouncements In May 2005, the FASB issued SFAS No. 154, Accounting Changes and Error Corrections, or SFAS 154, a replacement of APB No. 20, Accounting Changes , and SFAS No. 3, Reporting Accounting Changes in Interim Financial Statements . SFAS 154 changes the requirements for accounting for and reporting a change in accounting principle. Previously, most voluntary changes in accounting principles required recognition via a cumulative effect adjustment within the net income of the period of the change. SFAS 154 requires retrospective application to prior periods financial statements unless it is impracticable to determine either the period-specific effects or the cumulative effect of the change. SFAS 154 is effective for us in the first quarter of fiscal year 2007. We do not believe the adoption of SFAS 154 will have a material effect on our consolidated financial position, results of operations or cash flows. In July 2006, the FASB issued Interpretation No. 48, Accounting for Uncertainty in Income Taxes an interpretation of FASB Statement No. 109 , or SFAS 109. This interpretation clarifies the accounting for uncertainty in income taxes recognized in an enterprise financial statements in accordance with SFAS 109 . This interpretation is effective for us in the first quarter of fiscal year 2008. We are evaluating the impact of the adoption of this statement on our consolidated financial position, results of operations or cash flows. In September 2006, the FASB issued SFAS No. 157, Fair Value Measurements , or SFAS 157. SFAS 157 defines fair value, establishes a framework for measuring fair value in generally accepted accounting principles, and expands disclosures about fair value measurements. SFAS 157 is effective for financial statements issued for fiscal years beginning after November 15, 2007. We are currently assessing the impact that SFAS 157 may have on our consolidated financial position, results of operations or cash flows. In September 2006, the FASB issued SFAS No. 158, Employer Accounting for Defined Benefit Pension and Other Postretirement Plans an amendment of FASB Statements No. 87, 88, 106 and 132(R) , or SFAS 158. SFAS 158 requires us to (a) recognize a plan funded status in the statement of financial position, (b) measure a plan assets and its obligations that determine its funded status as of the end of the employer fiscal year and (c) recognize changes in the funded status of a defined postretirement plan in the year in which the changes occur through other comprehensive income. The requirement to recognize the funded status of a defined benefit plan and the disclosure requirements are effective for us in fiscal year ending September 28, 2007. Based on the funded status of our plan obligations disclosed in 66 Table of Contents Note 9 of the Notes to the Consolidated Financial Statements, the estimated impact of adopting SFAS 158 would have been a decrease in September 29, 2006 total assets of approximately $3 million, an increase in total liabilities of approximately $18 million and a reduction in stockholders equity of approximately $21 million, excluding impact of taxes. There would have been no impact on our September 29, 2006 Consolidated Statements of Earnings or Cash Flows. The actual impact of the implementation of SFAS 158 on the September 28, 2007 financial statements will differ due to changes in economic assumptions such as discount rates, measurement of fair values of plan assets, and other changes in actuarial assumptions that will occur in connection with our next measurement date on September 28, 2007. In September 2006, the SEC issued SAB No. 108, Considering the Effects of Prior Year Misstatements when Quantifying Misstatements in Current Year Financial Statements , or SAB 108, to address diversity in practice in quantifying financial statement misstatements. SAB 108 requires the quantification of misstatements based on their impact on both the balance sheet and the income statement to determine materiality. The guidance provides for a one-time cumulative effect adjustment to correct for misstatements that were not deemed material under a company prior approach but are material under the SAB 108 approach. SAB 108 is effective for our fourth quarter of fiscal year ending September 28, 2007. We are assessing the potential impact that SAB 108 may have on our consolidated financial position, results of operations or cash flows.
