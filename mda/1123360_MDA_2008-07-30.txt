ITEM 7 MANAGEMENT S DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS OF FINANCIAL CONDITION AND RESULTS OF OPERATIONS The following discussion and analysis contains forward-looking statements about our plans and expectations of what may happen in the future. Forward-looking statements are based on a number of assumptions and estimates that are inherently subject to significant risks and uncertainties, and our results could differ materially from the results anticipated by our forward-looking statements as a result of many known and unknown factors, including but not limited to those discussed in Item 1A Risk Factors of this report. See also Cautionary Notice Regarding Forward-Looking Statements located above Item 1 Business. You should read the following discussion and analysis in conjunction with Item 6 Selected Financial Data and Item 8 Financial Statements and Supplementary Data appearing elsewhere in this annual report. Business We are a leading payment processing and consumer money transfer company. As a high-volume processor of electronic transactions, we enable merchants, multinational corporations, financial institutions, consumers, government agencies and other profit and non-profit business enterprises to facilitate payments to purchase goods and services or further other economic goals. Our role is to serve as an intermediary in the exchange of information and funds that must occur between parties so that a payment transaction or money transfer can be completed. We were incorporated in Georgia as Global Payments Inc. in September 2000, and we spun-off from our former parent company on January 31, 2001. Including our time as part of our former parent company, we have provided transaction processing services since 1967. We market our products and services throughout the United States, Canada, Europe and the Asia-Pacific region. We operate in two business segments, merchant services and money transfer, and we offer various products through these segments. Our merchant services segment targets customers in many vertical industries including financial institutions, government, professional services, restaurants, universities, utilities, gaming, retail and health care. Our money transfer segment primarily targets immigrants in the United States and Europe. See Note 11 in the notes to consolidated financial statements for additional segment information. Our offerings in the merchant services segment provide merchants, independent sales organizations, or ISOs, and financial institutions with credit and debit card transaction processing, as well as check-related services. We use two basic business models to market our merchant services offerings. One model, referred to as direct merchant services, features a salaried and commissioned sales force, ISOs and independent sales representatives, all of whom sell our end-to-end services directly to merchants. Our other model, referred to as indirect merchant services, provides the same basic products and services as direct merchant services, primarily to financial institutions and a limited number of ISOs on an unbundled basis, that in turn resell our products and services to merchants. We also offer sales, installation, and servicing of ATM and point of sale, or POS, terminals and selected card issuing services, which are components of indirect merchant services, through Global Payments Europe, s.r.o., formerly known as MUZO, which is our subsidiary based in the Czech Republic. Our direct merchant services are marketed in the United States, Canada, and throughout the Asia-Pacific region, while our indirect merchant services are marketed in the United States, Canada, and Europe. Through our acquisition of HSBC Merchant Services in the United Kingdom on June 30, 2008, we will be offering direct merchant services in the United Kingdom. Direct merchant services revenue is generated on services primarily priced as a percentage of transaction value, whereas indirect merchant services revenue is generated on services primarily priced on a specified amount per transaction. In both merchant services models, we also charge for other processing fees unrelated to the number of transactions or the transaction value. Our money transfer segment provides money transfer services. A majority of the revenue derived from our money transfer offering consists of our electronic money transfer services marketed under our DolEx brand to 28 Table of Contents Index to Financial Statements first and second generation Latin Americans living in the United States. This consumer segment regularly transfers money to family and friends living in Latin America. Following the Europhil acquisition in December 2004, we expanded our money transfer origination locations into Europe and our settlement locations to Morocco, the Philippines, Romania, Poland and other new destinations. Money transfer revenue is earned on fees charged to customers based on the nature and amount of the transaction performed on the customers behalf and is recognized at the time of funds transfer. We also earn money transfer revenue on the difference between the retail exchange rate quoted at the time when the money transfer transaction is requested and the wholesale exchange rate at the time when the currency is purchased. This revenue is recognized when the money transfer transaction is processed through the settlement system and the funds are available to the beneficiary, as this is the point in time when the amount of revenue is determinable. Our products and services are marketed through a variety of distinct sales channels that include a dedicated direct sales force, ISOs, an internal telesales group, retail outlets, trade associations, alliance bank relationships and financial institutions. Executive Overview In the year ended May 31, 2008, or fiscal 2008, revenue increased 20% to $1,274.2 million from $1,061.5 million in the year ended May 31, 2007, or fiscal 2007. This revenue growth was primarily due to growth in our merchant services channels. Consolidated operating income was $251.4 million for fiscal 2008, compared to $218.1 million for fiscal 2007, which resulted in a decrease in operating margin to 19.7% for fiscal 2008 from 20.5% for fiscal 2007. Net income increased $19.8 million, or 14%, to $162.8 million in fiscal 2008 from $143.0 million in the prior year, resulting in a $0.26 increase in diluted earnings per share to $2.01 in fiscal 2008 from $1.75 in fiscal 2007. Merchant services segment revenue increased $201.5 million or 22% to $1,130.6 million in fiscal 2008 from $929.1 million in fiscal 2007. Merchant services segment operating income increased 13% to $293.0 million in fiscal 2008 from $259.7 million in fiscal 2007, with operating margins of 25.9% and 27.9% for fiscal 2008 and 2007, respectively. Money transfer segment revenue increased $11.2 million or 8% to $143.6 million in fiscal 2008 from $132.4 million in fiscal 2007. Money transfer segment operating income decreased 6% to $13.6 million in fiscal 2008 from $14.5 million in fiscal 2007, with operating margins of 9.5% and 10.9% for fiscal years 2008 and 2007, respectively. The consolidated operating income amounts reflect restructuring and other charges of $1.3 million and $3.1 million in fiscal 2008 and fiscal 2007, respectively. These charges primarily relate to employee termination benefits, fixed asset abandonment and facility closure costs due to facility consolidations and the elimination of redundant activities. Acquisitions During fiscal 2008, we acquired a portfolio of merchants that process Discover transactions and the rights to process Discover transactions for our existing and new merchants. As a result of this acquisition, we will now process Discover transactions similarly to how we currently process Visa and MasterCard transactions. The purpose of this acquisition was to offer merchants a single point of contact for Discover, Visa and MasterCard card processing. During fiscal 2008, we acquired a majority of the assets of Euroenvios Money Transfer, S.A. and Euroenvios Conecta, S.L., which we collectively refer to as LFS Spain. LFS Spain consisted of two privately-held corporations engaged in money transmittal and ancillary services from Spain to settlement locations primarily in Latin America. The purpose of the acquisition was to further our strategy of expanding our customer base and market share by opening additional branch locations. 29 Table of Contents Index to Financial Statements During fiscal 2008, we acquired a series of money transfer branch locations in the United States. The purpose of these acquisitions was to increase the market presence of our DolEx-branded money transfer offering. Facility Consolidations and Conversions In March 2007, we decided to consolidate our technical support center located in St. Louis, Missouri into our operations center in Owings Mills, Maryland. We believe this consolidation will improve our customer service by allowing us to provide our customers with a single point of contact in one physical location. This consolidation resulted in staff reduction, fixed asset abandonment and facility closure costs and was completed during our second quarter of fiscal 2008. During fiscal 2008, as part of our ongoing strategy to integrate our acquisitions into our existing systems, we completed the conversion of our Hong Kong and Macau merchant portfolio away from HSBC Asia and onto our back-end operating platform. Share Repurchase Program On April 5, 2007, our Board of Directors approved a share repurchase program that authorized the purchase of up to $100 million of Global Payments stock in the open market or as otherwise may be determined by us, subject to market conditions, business opportunities, and other factors. Under this authorization, we repurchased 2.3 million shares of our common stock during fiscal 2008 at a cost of $87.0 million, or an average of $37.85 per share, including commissions. As of May 31, 2008, we had $13.0 million remaining under our current share repurchase authorization. No amounts were repurchased during fiscal 2007. Subsequent Events On June 17, 2008, we entered into a purchase agreement with HSBC Bank plc, or HSBC UK, to obtain an interest in a newly formed limited partnership that will provide payment processing services to merchants in the United Kingdom and Internet merchants globally. The new partnership will operate under the name HSBC Merchant Services. On June 30, 2008, we completed the transaction and paid HSBC UK $439 million in cash to acquire a 51% majority ownership in the partnership. We will manage the day-to-day operations of the partnership, will control all major decisions and, accordingly, will consolidate the partnership financial results for accounting purposes effective with the closing date. HSBC UK retained ownership of the remaining 49% and contributed its existing merchant acquiring business in the United Kingdom to the partnership. In addition, HSBC UK entered into a ten-year marketing alliance with the partnership in which HSBC UK will refer customers to the partnership for payment processing services in the United Kingdom. On June 23, 2008, we entered into a new five year, $200 million term loan to fund a portion of the acquisition. We funded the remaining purchase price with excess cash and our existing credit facilities. See Note 16 in the notes to the consolidated financial statements for a more detailed discussion of the terms of the acquisition. 30 Table of Contents Index to Financial Statements Results of Operations Fiscal Year Ended May 31, 2008 Compared to Fiscal Year Ended May 31, 2007 The following table shows key selected financial data for the fiscal years ended May 31, 2008 and 2007, this data as a percentage of total revenues, and the changes between fiscal years in dollars and as a percentage of fiscal 2007. 2008 % of Revenue (1) 2007 % of Revenue (1) Change % Change (dollar amounts in thousands) Revenues: Domestic direct $ 687,065 54 % $ 558,026 53 % $ 129,039 23 % Canada 267,249 21 224,570 21 42,679 19 Asia-Pacific 72,367 6 48,449 5 23,918 49 Central and Eastern Europe 59,778 5 51,224 5 8,554 17 Domestic indirect and other 44,150 3 46,873 4 (2,723 ) (6 ) Merchant services 1,130,609 89 929,142 88 201,467 22 Domestic 119,019 9 115,416 11 3,603 3 Europe 24,601 2 16,965 2 7,636 45 Money transfer 143,620 11 132,381 12 11,239 8 Total revenues $ 1,274,229 100 % $ 1,061,523 100 % $ 212,706 20 % Consolidated operating expenses: Cost of service $ 475,612 37.3 % $ 414,837 39.1 % $ 60,775 15 % Sales, general and administrative 545,941 42.8 425,509 40.1 120,432 28 Restructuring and other 1,317 0.1 3,088 0.3 (1,771 ) (57 ) Operating income $ 251,359 19.7 % $ 218,089 20.5 % $ 33,270 15 % Operating income for segments: Merchant services $ 293,030 $ 259,670 $ 33,360 13 % Money transfer 13,635 14,476 (841 ) (6 ) Corporate (53,989 ) (52,969 ) (1,020 ) (2 ) Restructuring and other (1,317 ) (3,088 ) 1,771 57 Operating income $ 251,359 $ 218,089 $ 33,270 15 % Operating margin for segments: Merchant services segment 25.9 % 27.9 % (2.0 )% Money transfer segment 9.5 % 10.9 % (1.4 )% (1) Percentage amounts may not sum to the total due to rounding. Revenues We derive our revenues from three primary sources: charges based on volumes and fees for services, charges based on transaction quantity, and equipment sales, leases and service fees. Revenues generated by these areas depend upon a number of factors, such as demand for and price of our services, the technological competitiveness of our product offerings, our reputation for providing timely and reliable service, competition within our industry, and general economic conditions. In fiscal 2008, revenue increased 20% to $1,274.2 million compared to the prior year comparable period. We attribute this revenue growth primarily to our merchant services channels. We intend to continue to grow our domestic and international presence, build our ISO sales channel, increase customer satisfaction, assess 31 Table of Contents Index to Financial Statements opportunities for profitable growth through acquisitions, pursue enhanced products and services for our customers, and leverage our existing business model. We expect our fiscal 2009 consolidated revenues to range from $1,620 million to $1,675 million, reflecting growth of 27% to 31% over fiscal 2008. This range includes the partial year impact of our June 30, 2008 acquisition of HSBC Merchant Services in the United Kingdom. Merchant Services Segment Revenue from our merchant services segment for fiscal 2008 increased by $201.5 million or 22% to $1,130.6 million compared to the prior year comparable period. We have continued to grow our domestic direct merchant channel by adding small and mid-market merchants in diversified vertical markets, primarily through our ISOs. For fiscal 2008, our credit and debit card processed transactions grew 26% and our revenue grew 23% for this channel compared to the prior year period. In fiscal 2008 compared to the prior year comparable period, our domestic direct credit card average dollar value of transaction, or average ticket, decreased in the mid single digit percentage range, due to a shift toward smaller merchants added through our ISOs. Offsetting this decline in average ticket was a mid single digit percentage increase in our average discount revenue per dollar value volume, or spread, in fiscal 2008 compared to the prior year comparable period. Our spread was favorably impacted by the shift towards smaller merchants added through our ISOs. Smaller merchants tend to have lower average tickets and higher spreads than larger merchants. Aside from the impact of changes in our average ticket and spread, the remaining difference between our transaction growth and revenue growth was due to our service fees, equipment fees and check-related services. The total of this revenue grew at a lesser rate than our credit and debit card transaction growth. For fiscal 2008, our Canadian direct credit and debit card processed transactions grew 3%, with overall Canadian revenue growth of 19% compared to the prior year period. The difference between our transaction growth and revenue growth was primarily due to a favorable Canadian currency exchange rate and a positive impact from changes in the Canadian market interchange structure implemented in April 2008, offset by the unfavorable impact of non-recurring card association incentive revenue realized during fiscal 2007. Our Asia-Pacific merchant services revenue for fiscal 2008 increased 49% compared to the prior year period. This growth was due to enhancing our sales force, industry expansion and strategic pricing initiatives. Also contributing to the growth is the impact of reporting a full year of results in fiscal 2008 compared to a partial year in fiscal 2007. We completed the purchase of our ownership in HSBC Asia-Pacific merchant acquiring business on July 24, 2006, and began operating in this channel at that time. Our Central and Eastern European merchant services revenue for fiscal 2008 increased 17% compared to the prior year period, largely due to a favorable Czech currency exchange rate, the impact of our Diginet acquisition and growth in credit and debit card processed transactions of 11%. Revenue growth was offset by the loss of a major customer which deconverted at the end of fiscal 2007, in addition to the impact of price reductions granted on contract renewals. We experienced continued and expected declines in our domestic indirect and other channel during fiscal 2008, with a decline in revenue of 6% compared to the prior year comparable period. We attributed this revenue decline to the industry consolidation of financial institutions and competitive pricing pressures. Money Transfer Segment For fiscal 2008, revenue from our money transfer segment increased 8% to $143.6 million compared to the prior year comparable period. Our domestic money transfer channel relates to all revenue originating from the money transfer branches that we operate in the United States, which may include money transfers to destinations both inside and outside 32 Table of Contents Index to Financial Statements of the United States. For fiscal 2008, our domestic money transfer channel transactions grew 7% and revenue increased 3%, compared to the prior year comparable period. The growth in transactions was driven primarily by same store sales growth and acquired branch locations. We decreased our domestic branch footprint to 793 domestic branches for fiscal 2008, compared to 875 branch locations in fiscal 2007. On a sequential basis, our domestic branch footprint as of May 31, 2008 decreased by 32 locations compared to our domestic branch footprint as of February 29, 2008. This decrease in domestic branches was the result of the closure of underperforming locations, partially offset by branch acquisitions and, to a lesser extent, new branch openings. The difference between our domestic transaction growth and revenue growth was primarily due to lower pricing. We believe that fewer immigrants may be coming to the United States due to increased immigration legislation and enforcement, a downturn in the United States housing market, and an improving Mexican economy, which may be contributing to a competitive pricing environment. We have a significant amount of goodwill and other indefinite-lived intangible assets associated with this business. Although we currently believe that these unfavorable trends are temporary, if they either worsen or continue for longer than we expect, or if any future adverse trends arise in the operating performance of this business, the carrying amount of these intangible assets may be impacted. In contrast with the unfavorable pricing trends for the full fiscal 2008 year, recent trends have improved. For the three months ended May 31, 2008, we achieved 13% revenue growth in this business. This growth reflected a significant improvement in operating performance compared to the nine months ended February 29, 2008, primarily due to stabilized pricing. Our European money transfer channel relates to all revenue generated from the money transfer branches that we operate in Europe, which may include money transfers to destinations both inside and outside of Europe. In Europe, we increased our branch footprint to 90 locations for fiscal 2008, compared to 68 locations in fiscal 2007, primarily through our acquisition of LFS Spain. For fiscal 2008, our European money transfer revenue grew 45%, primarily due to acquired and new branch locations, which resulted in transaction growth of 34%. Revenues for fiscal 2008 were also impacted by a favorable year-over-year currency exchange rate. Consolidated Operating Expenses Cost of service consists primarily of the following costs: operational-related personnel, including those who monitor our transaction processing systems and settlement; assessments and other fees paid to card associations; transaction processing systems, including third-party services such as the costs of settlement channels for money transfer services; transition services paid to HSBC in the Asia-Pacific market; network telecommunications capability, depreciation and occupancy costs associated with the facilities performing these functions; amortization of intangible assets; and provisions for operating losses. Cost of service increased 15% to $475.6 million for fiscal 2008 compared to the prior year comparable period. As a percentage of revenue, cost of service decreased to 37.3% of revenue for fiscal 2008 from 39.1% in fiscal 2007. For fiscal 2008, the decline in cost of service as a percentage of revenue was related to our revenue growth and the related economies of scale benefits. The growth in cost of service expenses was primarily due to the following factors: the addition of our Asia-Pacific channel; costs associated with our money transfer segment; the weakening of the United States dollar compared to the currencies of Canada, the Czech Republic, and Spain; increased losses in our check guarantee service offering; and increases in variable processing expenses associated with our revenue growth, primarily assessment fees paid to card associations. Sales, general and administrative expenses consists primarily of salaries, wages and related expenses paid to sales personnel, non-revenue producing customer support functions and administrative employees and management, commissions to independent contractors and ISOs, advertising costs, other selling expenses, share-based compensation expenses and occupancy of leased space directly related to these functions. 33 Table of Contents Index to Financial Statements Sales, general and administrative expenses increased 28% to $545.9 million compared to the prior year comparable period. As a percentage of revenue, these expenses increased to 42.8% for fiscal 2008 compared to 40.1% in fiscal 2007. The increases in sales, general and administrative expenses were primarily due to growth in commission payments to ISOs resulting from the increased revenue in this sales channel. The ISO channel generally has a dilutive effect on our operating margin compared to our other channels due to the ongoing commission payments to the ISOs. The ISO commission model differs from our other sales channels where the commissions are primarily paid for only a twelve-month period. The addition of our new Asia-Pacific channel also contributed to the increases in sales, general and administrative expenses due to the investment in the regional sales force and infrastructure. Lastly, the weakening of the United States dollar compared to the currencies of Canada, the Czech Republic and Spain also increased these expenses. Offsetting the increases in sales, general and administrative expenses was the favorable impact of a non-recurring, non-cash operating tax item of $7.0 million that was recognized in fiscal 2008. During fiscal 2008, we determined that an accrued liability relating to a contingent operating tax matter was no longer deemed to be probable. We made this determination as a result of consultation with outside legal counsel and further analysis of applicable legislation. As such, we released the related liability. See Taxes under Note 13 in the notes to the consolidated financial statements for additional details. Operating Income and Operating Margin for Segments For the purpose of discussing segment operations, management refers to operating income as calculated by subtracting segment direct expenses from segment revenue. Overhead and shared expenses, including share-based compensation costs, are not allocated to the segments operations; they are reported in the caption Corporate. Similarly, references to operating margin regarding segment operations mean segment operating income divided by segment revenue. Merchant Services Segment Operating income in the merchant services segment increased 13% to $293.0 million for fiscal 2008 compared to the prior year comparable period. The operating margin was 25.9% and 27.9% for fiscal 2008 and fiscal 2007, respectively. This operating margin decline was primarily due to the growth of our ISO channel, the ongoing investments in our Asia-Pacific channel, the customer attrition and pricing pressure in our Central and Eastern European channel, increased losses in our check guarantee service offering, and the prior year non-recurring card association incentive revenue in Canada. Offsetting this decline in operating margin was the impact of the operating tax item discussed above. Lastly, due to strengthened foreign currencies compared to the United States dollar, we received a benefit during fiscal 2008 of $42.1 million in revenue and $0.15 in diluted earnings per share, most of which relates to our merchant services segment. Money Transfer Segment Operating income in the money transfer segment decreased 6% to $13.6 million for fiscal 2008 compared to the prior year comparable period. This decrease resulted in an operating margin of 9.5% for fiscal 2008, compared to 10.9% in the prior year comparable period. This operating margin decline was primarily due to the increased price competition discussed above and our use of a fixed-cost, branch model at the point of sale. In addition, we incurred costs associated with the closure of underperforming locations, such as lease termination fees and fixed asset write-offs. In contrast with the operating margin decline for the full fiscal 2008 year, recent trends have improved. For the three months ended 34 Table of Contents Index to Financial Statements May 31, 2008, we achieved operating income growth of 116% in this segment compared to the prior year comparable period, and our operating margin improved to 18.6% compared to 10.2% in the prior year comparable period. These strong results were primarily due to stabilized pricing, the closure of underperforming branch locations, and economies of scale benefits resulting from our fixed cost model. Corporate Our corporate expenses primarily include costs associated with our Atlanta headquarters, insurance, employee incentive programs, Board of Directors fees, share-based compensation, and certain corporate staffing areas, including finance, accounting, legal, human resources, marketing, and executive. Our corporate costs increased 2% to $54.0 million for fiscal 2008 compared to $53.0 million for fiscal 2007. These increases were primarily due to higher employee incentive program expenses, offset by lower share-based compensation costs. Restructuring and Other Charges During the fourth quarter of fiscal 2007, we committed to plans to close two locations and consolidate their functions into existing locations, which is consistent with our strategy to leverage infrastructure and consolidate operations. These restructuring plans required staff reduction and facility closure costs and were completed during our second quarter of fiscal 2008. We recorded restructuring charges of $1.3 million in fiscal 2008. We recorded restructuring and other charges of $3.1 million in fiscal 2007. Consolidated Operating Income Consolidated operating income increased 15% to $251.4 million for fiscal 2008 compared to the prior year comparable period. This change resulted in an operating margin of 19.7% for fiscal 2008 compared to 20.5% in the prior year comparable period. Consolidated Other Income/Expense, Net Other income and expense consists primarily of interest income and interest expense. Interest and other income, net increased to $10.0 million in fiscal 2008 compared to $8.2 million in the prior year comparable period. This improvement was largely due to higher interest income due to higher cash balances. Provision for Income Taxes In fiscal 2008, our effective tax rate, reflected as the provision for income taxes divided by income before income taxes, including the effect of minority interest, increased to 35.6% from 34.1% in fiscal 2007. This increase was primarily due to favorable one-time tax benefit items in the prior year comparable period related to income tax statute expirations and certain tax planning initiatives. Minority Interest, Net of Tax Minority interest, net of tax decreased to $8.1 million for fiscal 2008 compared to $9.9 million in the prior year comparable period. This decrease primarily related to our investment in our Asia-Pacific channel, offset by growth in our Comerica Bank alliance. Net Income and Diluted Earnings Per Share Net income increased 14% to $162.8 million in fiscal 2008 compared to the prior year comparable period. This growth resulted in a 15% increase in diluted earnings per share to $2.01 in fiscal 2008 compared to the prior year comparable period. We expect diluted earnings per share to range from $2.20 to $2.30 for fiscal 2009. 35 Table of Contents Index to Financial Statements New Accounting Pronouncements In September 2006, the Financial Accounting Standards Board issued Statement of Financial Accounting Standards No. 157, Fair Value Measurements ( FAS 157 ). This statement defines fair value, establishes a framework for measuring fair value in generally accepted accounting principles, and expands disclosures about fair value measurements. Companies are required to implement FAS 157 for the first financial statements issued for fiscal years beginning after November 15, 2007 for financial assets and liabilities, as well as for any other assets and liabilities that are carried at fair value on a recurring basis. In November 2007, the Financial Accounting Standards Board granted a one year deferral for the implementation of FAS 157 for non-financial assets and liabilities. The adoption of FAS 157 on June 1, 2008 is not expected to have a material impact on our consolidated balance sheet or consolidated statement of income, but the implementation of FAS 157 will require additional disclosures. In February 2007, the Financial Accounting Standards Board issued Statement of Financial Accounting Standards No. 159, The Fair Value Option for Financial Assets and Financial Liabilities Including an Amendment of FASB Statement No. 115 ( FAS 159 ). This statement permits us to choose to measure many financial instruments and certain other items at fair value. Upon adoption of FAS 159 on June 1, 2008, we will not elect the fair value option for any financial instrument we do not currently report at fair value. In December 2007, the Financial Accounting Standards Board issued Statement of Financial Accounting Standards No. 141 (Revised) Business Combinations ( FAS 141R ). This statement establishes principles and requirements for how we recognize and measure in our financial statements the identifiable assets acquired, the liabilities assumed, and any noncontrolling interest in the acquiree. In addition, this standard establishes principles and requirements for how we recognize and measure the goodwill acquired in the business combination or gain from a bargain purchase, and how we determine what information to disclose to enable financial statement users to evaluate the nature and financial effects of the business combination. FAS 141R will become effective for us for business combinations in which the acquisition date is on or after June 1, 2009. In December 2007, the Financial Accounting Standards Board issued Statement of Financial Accounting Standards No. 160, Noncontrolling Interests in Consolidated Financial Statements ( FAS 160 ). This statement applies to the accounting for noncontrolling interests (currently referred to as minority interest) in a subsidiary and for the deconsolidation of a subsidiary. FAS 160 will become effective for us on June 1, 2009. As further described in Note 13 and 16 of the consolidated financial statements, we have minority interest that includes redemption provisions that are not solely within our control, commonly referred to as a redeemable minority interest. At the March 12, 2008 meeting of the FASB Emerging Issues Task Force ( EITF ), certain revisions occurred to EITF Topic No. D-98, Classification and Measurement of Redeemable Securities ( Topic D-98 ). These revisions clarified that Topic D-98 applies to redeemable minority interests and requires that its provision be applied no later than the effective date of FAS 160. While we are still evaluating the impact on our consolidated financial statements of FAS 160, we have determined that, upon adoption of this standard and in conjunction with the provisions of Topic D-98, an adjustment for the then fair value of redeemable minority interests will be required. This adjustment will ultimately increase the carrying value of redeemable minority interests to the redemption value with a corresponding charge to equity. Under Topic D-98, we will have a choice of either accreting redeemable minority interest to its redemption value over the redemption period or recognizing changes in the redemption value immediately as they occur. We are currently evaluating the recognition and measurement provisions of Topic D-98, and we have not yet concluded which measurement method we will apply. 36 Table of Contents Index to Financial Statements Fiscal Year Ended May 31, 2007 Compared to Fiscal Year Ended May 31, 2006 The following table shows key selected financial data for the fiscal years ended May 31, 2007 and 2006, this data as a percentage of total revenues, and the changes between fiscal years in dollars and as a percentage of fiscal 2006. 2007 % of Revenue (1) 2006 % of Revenue (1) Change % Change (dollar amounts in thousands) Revenues: Domestic direct $ 558,026 53 % $ 481,273 53 % $ 76,753 16 % Canada 224,570 21 208,126 23 16,444 8 Asia-Pacific 48,449 5 48,449 Central and Eastern Europe 51,224 5 47,114 5 4,110 9 Domestic indirect and other 46,873 4 51,987 6 (5,114 ) (10 ) Merchant services 929,142 88 788,500 87 140,642 18 Domestic 115,416 11 109,067 12 6,349 6 Europe 16,965 2 10,489 1 6,476 62 Money transfer 132,381 12 119,556 13 12,825 11 Total revenues $ 1,061,523 100 % $ 908,056 100 % $ 153,467 17 % Consolidated operating expenses: Cost of service $ 414,837 39.1 % $ 358,020 39.4 % $ 56,817 16 % Sales, general and administrative 425,509 40.1 347,070 38.2 78,439 23 Restructuring and other 3,088 0.3 1,878 0.2 1,210 64 Operating income $ 218,089 20.5 % $ 201,088 22.1 % $ 17,001 8 % Operating income for segments: Merchant services $ 259,670 $ 224,221 $ 35,449 16 % Money transfer 14,476 18,741 (4,265 ) (23 ) Corporate (52,969 ) (39,996 ) (12,973 ) (32 ) Restructuring and other (3,088 ) (1,878 ) (1,210 ) (64 ) Operating income $ 218,089 $ 201,088 $ 17,001 8 % Operating margin for segments: Merchant services segment 27.9 % 28.4 % (0.5 )% Money transfer segment 10.9 % 15.7 % (4.8 )% (1) Percentage amounts may not sum to the total due to rounding. Revenues We derive our revenues from three primary sources: charges based on volumes and fees for services, charges based on transaction quantity, and equipment sales, leases and service fees. Revenues generated by these areas depend upon a number of factors, such as demand for and price of our services, the technological competitiveness of our product offerings, our reputation for providing timely and reliable service, competition within our industry, and general economic conditions. In fiscal 2007, revenue increased 17% to $1,061.5 million from $908.1 million for fiscal 2006. We attribute this revenue growth primarily to our domestic direct and new Asia-Pacific merchant services channels. Merchant Services Segment Revenue from our merchant services segment for fiscal 2007 increased by $140.6 million or 18% to $929.1 million from $788.5 million for fiscal 2006. 37 Table of Contents Index to Financial Statements We have continued to grow our domestic direct merchant services channel by adding small and mid-market merchants in diversified vertical markets, primarily through our ISOs. For fiscal 2007, our credit and debit card processed transactions grew 25% and our revenue grew 16% for this channel compared to the prior year. The difference between our transaction growth and revenue growth was primarily a result of a mid single digit percentage decline compared to the prior year in our domestic direct credit card average dollar value of transaction, or average ticket, due to a shift toward smaller merchants added through our ISOs. Our average discount revenue per dollar value volume, or spread, was constant compared to the prior year and, therefore, did not impact the difference between our transaction growth and revenue growth. Our spread was favorably impacted by the shift towards smaller merchants added through our ISOs. Smaller merchants tend to have lower average tickets and higher spreads than larger merchants. This favorable impact on spread was offset by pricing compression relating to merchants added through our direct sales force. Aside from the decline in average ticket described above, the remaining difference between our transaction growth and revenue growth was due to our domestic direct revenue that is not based on the amount of transactions or average ticket described above. This type of revenue includes service fees, equipment fees and check-related services. The total of this revenue grew at a lesser rate than our credit and debit card transaction growth. For fiscal 2007, our Canadian direct credit and debit card processed transactions grew 4%, with overall Canadian revenue growth of 8% compared to the prior year. Our Canadian transaction growth was largely offset by mid single digit percentage declines in our average credit card spread, compared to the prior year. Our revenue growth for fiscal 2007 was primarily due to a favorable Canadian currency exchange rate and card association incentive revenue relating to various programs being implemented in the Canadian market. These card association incentives are not recurring in nature. Our Asia-Pacific merchant services revenue for fiscal 2007 was $48.4 million. We completed the purchase of our ownership in HSBC Asia merchant acquiring business on July 24, 2006, and began operating in this channel at that time. Our Central and Eastern European merchant services revenue for fiscal 2007 increased 9% compared to the prior year period, largely due to a favorable Czech currency exchange rate, the impact of our Diginet acquisition and growth in credit and debit card processed transactions of 15%. These factors were partially offset by the impact of price reductions granted on contract renewals. The deconversion process of the large customer that announced its intention to deconvert prior to the completion of our MUZO acquisition was substantially completed during fiscal 2007. We experienced continued and expected declines in our domestic indirect and other channel, with a 4% year-over-year decline in credit and debit card transactions processed and a 10% decline in revenue for fiscal 2007. We attributed these revenue declines to the industry consolidation of financial institutions and competitive pricing pressures. Money Transfer Segment For fiscal 2007, our domestic money transfer channel transactions grew 18% and revenue grew 6%, compared to fiscal 2006. The growth in transactions was driven primarily by same store sales growth and an increasing domestic branch footprint resulting in 875 domestic branches as of May 31, 2007, compared to 835 domestic branch locations as of May 31, 2006. The difference between our transaction growth and our revenue growth was due to lower pricing compared to the prior year, which was consistent with our strategy of price leadership. During fiscal 2007, we experienced a highly competitive pricing environment. Our fiscal 2007 revenue was also negatively impacted by one of our landlords entering the money transfer business and competing with us. As a result, we exited those locations, opened new locations nearby, and responded to aggressive price competition from this landlord to pursue the existing customer base. 38 Table of Contents Index to Financial Statements In Europe, we ended fiscal 2007 with 68 branch locations, compared to 40 locations as of May 31, 2006. For fiscal 2007, our European money transfer revenue grew 62%, with transaction growth of 73%. This growth was largely due to new branch locations compared to the prior year. Consolidated Operating Expenses Cost of service consists primarily of the following costs: operational-related personnel, including those who monitor our transaction processing systems and settlement; assessments and other fees paid to card associations; transaction processing systems, including third-party services such as the costs of settlement channels for money transfer services; transition services paid to HSBC in the Asia-Pacific market; network telecommunications capability, depreciation and occupancy costs associated with the facilities performing these functions; amortization of intangible assets; and provisions for operating losses. Cost of service increased 16% to $414.8 million for fiscal 2007 compared to $358.0 million in fiscal 2006. As a percentage of revenue, cost of service decreased to 39.1% of revenue for fiscal 2007 from 39.4% in fiscal 2006. In fiscal 2007, the decline in cost of service as a percentage of revenue was partially related to our revenue growth and the related economies of scale benefits. In addition, this decline was related to several cost factors, including savings from exiting our shared service agreement with our former parent company and a decline in year-over-year operating costs from our domestic and Canadian customer service and back-office centers, including our Dallas facility that we closed in November 2005. In addition, during the quarter ended August 31, 2005, we recognized an impairment loss of $2.2 million in connection with the MUZO trademark, which is included in cost of service in the accompanying consolidated statement of income for fiscal 2006. Sales, general and administrative expenses consists primarily of salaries, wages and related expenses paid to sales personnel, non-revenue producing customer support functions and administrative employees and management, commissions to independent contractors and ISOs, advertising costs, other selling expenses, share-based compensation expenses and occupancy of leased space directly related to these functions. Sales, general and administrative expenses increased by $78.4 million or 23% to $425.5 million for fiscal 2007 from $347.1 million for fiscal 2006. As a percentage of revenue, these expenses increased to 40.1% for fiscal 2007 compared to 38.2% for fiscal 2006. The increases in sales, general and administrative expenses were primarily due to growth in commission payments to ISOs resulting from the increased revenue in this sales channel. The ISO channel generally has a dilutive effect on our operating margin compared to our other channels due to the ongoing commission payments to the ISOs. The ISO commission model differs from our other sales channels where the commissions are primarily paid for only a twelve-month period. The addition of our new Asia-Pacific channel also contributed to the increases in sales, general and administrative expenses due to the investment in the regional sales force and infrastructure. In addition, sales, general and administrative expenses increased for fiscal 2007 compared to fiscal 2006 as a result of our adoption, using the modified prospective method, of Statement of Financial Accounting Standards No. 123 (revised 2004): Share-based Payment , or FAS 123R, on June 1, 2006. The total share-based compensation cost that has been included in sales, general and administrative expenses for our share-based awards and option plans was $15.2 million for fiscal 2007. The total share-based compensation cost that has been included in sales, general and administrative expenses for our share-based awards and option plans was $2.8 million for fiscal 2006. During fiscal 2007, we recognized $12.4 million in incremental employee stock option expense as a result of FAS 123R. 39 Table of Contents Index to Financial Statements Operating Income and Operating Margin for Segments For the purpose of discussing segment operations, management refers to operating income as calculated by subtracting segment direct expenses from segment revenue. Overhead and shared expenses, including share-based compensation costs, are not allocated to the segments operations; they are reported in the caption Corporate. Similarly, references to operating margin regarding segment operations mean segment operating income divided by segment revenue. Merchant Services Segment Operating income in the merchant services segment increased 16% to $259.7 million for fiscal 2007 compared to $224.2 million for fiscal 2006. This change resulted in an operating margin of 27.9% for fiscal 2007, compared to 28.4% for fiscal 2006. Our operating margin decreased for fiscal 2007 primarily due to the increases in ISO commission payments and the addition of, and our investment in, our new Asia-Pacific channel, offset by merchant services revenue growth and the cost of service savings discussed above. Money Transfer Segment Operating income in the money transfer segment decreased 23% to $14.5 million for fiscal 2007 compared to $18.7 million for fiscal 2006. This decrease resulted in an operating margin of 10.9% for fiscal 2007, compared to 15.7% for fiscal 2006. This operating margin decline was primarily due to the increased price competition discussed above and our use of a fixed-cost, branch-owned model at the point of sale. Corporate Our corporate expenses primarily include costs associated with our Atlanta headquarters, insurance, employee incentive programs, Board of Directors fees, and certain corporate staffing areas, including finance, accounting, legal, human resources, marketing, and executive. For fiscal 2007, corporate also includes expenses associated with our share-based compensation. Our corporate costs increased 32% to $53.0 million for fiscal 2007 compared to $40.0 million for fiscal 2006. These increases are primarily due to share-based compensation costs related to our implementation of FAS 123R, as described above. Restructuring and Other Charges During the fourth quarter of fiscal 2007, we committed to plans to close two locations and consolidate their functions into existing locations, which is consistent with our strategy to leverage infrastructure and consolidate operations. These restructuring plans will required staff reduction and facility closure costs and were completed during our second quarter of fiscal 2008. We recorded restructuring and other charges of $3.1 million in fiscal 2007. In fiscal 2006, we incurred $1.9 million in restructuring charges in connection with our 2005 restructuring plans. Consolidated Operating Income Consolidated operating income increased $17.0 million or 8% to $218.1 million for fiscal 2007 compared to $201.1 million for fiscal 2006. This change resulted in an operating margin of 20.5% for fiscal 2007 compared to 22.1% for fiscal 2006. Consolidated Other Income/Expense, Net Other income and expense consists primarily of interest income and interest expense. Interest and other income increased $7.8 million to $8.2 million for fiscal 2007 compared to $0.4 million for fiscal 2006. This improvement was largely due to higher interest income due to higher cash balances and investment rates. 40 Table of Contents Index to Financial Statements Provision for Income Taxes In fiscal 2007, our tax rate, reflected as the provision for income taxes divided by income before income tax and minority interest, decreased to 32.4% from 33.5% in fiscal 2006. The changes in our effective tax rate are due to tax planning initiatives and the impact of international growth. Minority Interest, Net of Tax Minority interest, net of tax increased $1.4 million to $9.9 million for fiscal 2007 compared to $8.5 million for fiscal 2006. This increase was due to our new HSBC merchant acquiring acquisition in the Asia-Pacific region. Net Income and Diluted Earnings Per Share Net income increased $17.5 million or 14% to $143.0 million for fiscal 2007 from $125.5 million for fiscal 2006. This increase resulted in a $0.22 increase in diluted earnings per share to $1.75 for fiscal 2007 compared to $1.53 for fiscal 2006. Liquidity and Capital Resources Cash flow generated from operations provides us with a significant source of liquidity to meet our needs. For fiscal 2008, we had cash and cash equivalents totaling $456.1 million. For fiscal 2008, our cash and cash equivalents included $131.6 million related to Merchant reserves. While this cash is not restricted and can be used in our general operations, we do not intend to use it, as we believe that designating this cash to collateralize Merchant reserves strengthens our fiduciary standing with our member sponsors and is in accordance with the guidelines set by the card associations. See Cash and cash equivalents under Note 1 in the notes to the consolidated financial statements for additional details. Net cash provided by operating activities increased $81.3 million to $272.4 million for fiscal 2008 from $191.1 million in fiscal 2007. The increase in cash flow from operating activities was primarily due to the increases in net income of $19.8 million and cash provided by changes in working capital of $57.1 million. The working capital change was primarily due to the change in net settlement processing assets and obligations of $52.2 million, the change in income taxes payable of $19.4 million, the change in accounts payable and accrued liabilities of $3.8 million, and the change in payables to money transfer beneficiaries of $2.5 million, partially offset by the change in accounts receivable of $15.4 million and the change in claims receivable of $3.6 million. The change in net settlement processing assets and obligations relates to timing differences, processed volume changes and exchange rate fluctuations. In addition, the change is associated with the addition of certain Asia-Pacific jurisdictions that have been converted to our back-end processing systems. See Settlement processing assets and obligations under Note 1 in the notes to the consolidated financial statements for additional details. The change in income taxes payable is attributed to the timing and amount of estimated tax payments this year compared to last year. The change in accounts payable and accrued liabilities is due to timing differences related to payments versus accruals, primarily ISO commissions, year-end bonus accruals, employee benefit payments, obligations to purchase foreign currencies, and third party processing charges. The change in payables to money transfer beneficiaries is attributed to timing differences which fluctuate with the volume and value of our money transfer transactions. The change in accounts receivable is primarily due to the timing and growth of our domestic direct revenue and foreign exchange rate variances on our accounts receivable balances. The change in claims receivable fluctuates based on the current inventory of claims relative to the character, value and age of the claims, and the rate and value of write-offs. Net cash used in investing activities decreased $53.4 million to $63.2 million in fiscal 2008 from $116.6 million in fiscal 2007 due to a decrease in business acquisition activities. During fiscal 2008, business and 41 Table of Contents Index to Financial Statements intangible asset acquisitions required $18.2 million for the acquisition of money transfer branch locations, the Discover portfolio acquisition, the LFS Spain acquisition, and a customer list and long-term merchant referral agreement in our Canadian merchant services channel. During fiscal 2007, business acquisition activity required $81.3 million for the HSBC Asia-Pacific merchant acquiring acquisition, the Diginet acquisition, and the acquisition of money transfer branches. On June 30, 2008, we completed the transaction with HSBC Bank plc in the United Kingdom and paid $439 million in cash to acquire a 51% majority ownership in the partnership. In connection with this acquisition, on June 23, 2008, we entered into a new five year, $200 million term loan agreement. We funded the remaining purchase price with excess cash and our existing credit facilities. Capital expenditures increased to $45.0 million in fiscal 2008 from $35.4 million in fiscal 2007. These expenditures primarily relate to software and infrastructure, including our next generation technology processing platform. The capital expenditures for fiscal 2008 also included spending for merchant terminals and our operating center consolidation plan that we committed to during the fourth quarter of fiscal 2007. For fiscal 2008, $76.4 million, net was used in financing activities compared to $10.9 million, net provided by financing activities in fiscal 2007. The increase in cash used in financing activities was primarily due to $87.0 million in share repurchases of our common stock during fiscal 2008. See the Executive Overview above for additional details. We believe that our current level of cash and borrowing capacity under our term loan and lines of credit described below, together with future cash flows from operations, are sufficient to meet the needs of our existing operations and planned requirements for the foreseeable future. For fiscal 2009, we do not have any material capital commitments, other than commitments under operating leases and planned expansions, including the HSBC Merchant Services acquisition in the United Kingdom. We regularly evaluate cash requirements for current operations, commitments, development activities and acquisitions, and we may elect to raise additional funds for these purposes in the future, either through the issuance of debt, equity or otherwise. Our current cash flow strategy is to pay off debt, to make planned capital investments in our business, to pursue acquisitions that meet our growth strategies, to pay dividends and repurchase our shares at the discretion of our Board of Directors, to collateralize our Merchant reserves, and to invest excess cash in investments that we believe are of high-quality and marketable in the short term. Credit Facilities In November 2006, we entered into a five year, $350 million unsecured revolving credit facility agreement with a syndicate of banks based in the United States, which we refer to as our U.S. Credit Facility. The credit agreement contains certain financial and non-financial covenants and events of default customary for financings of this nature. We complied with these covenants as of May 31, 2008. The facility expires in November 2011, and borrowings bear a variable interest rate based on a market short-term floating rate plus a margin that varies according to our leverage position. In addition, the U.S. Credit Facility allows us to expand the facility size to $700 million by requesting additional commitments from existing or new lenders. We plan to use the U.S. Credit Facility to fund future strategic acquisitions, to provide a source of working capital, and for general corporate purposes. As of both May 31, 2008 and May 31, 2007, we had no borrowings outstanding on our U.S. Credit Facility. In November 2006, we entered into an amendment to our credit facility, which we refer to as our Canadian Credit Facility, with the Canadian Imperial Bank of Commerce, or CIBC, as administrative agent and lender. The Canadian Credit Facility is a facility which consists of a line of credit of $25 million Canadian dollars, or $25.2 million United States dollars based on the May 31, 2008 exchange rate. In addition, the Canadian Credit Facility allows us to expand the size of the uncommitted facility to $50 million Canadian dollars during the peak holiday season and does not have a fixed term. The Canadian Credit Facility carries no termination date, but can be 42 Table of Contents Index to Financial Statements terminated by CIBC with advance notice. The Canadian Credit Facility has a variable interest rate based on the Canadian dollar London Interbank Offered Rate plus a margin. The Canadian Credit Facility allows us to provide certain Canadian merchants with same day value for their Visa credit card deposits. Same day value is the practice of giving merchants value for credit card transactions on the date of the applicable sale even though we receive the corresponding settlement funds from Visa Canada/International at a later date. The amounts borrowed under the Canadian Credit Facility are restricted in use to pay Canadian Visa merchants and such amounts are generally received from Visa Canada/International on the following day. Our obligations under the Canadian Credit Facility are secured by a first priority security interest in the members accounts receivable from Visa Canada/International and Interac Associates for our transactions processed through the CIBC Visa BIN and Interac debit network, the bank accounts in which the settlement funds are deposited, and by guarantees from certain of our subsidiaries. These guarantees are subordinate to any guarantees granted by such subsidiaries under our U.S. Credit Facility. The Canadian Credit Facility also contains certain financial and non-financial covenants and events of default customary for financings of this nature. We complied with these covenants as of May 31, 2008. As of both May 31, 2008 and May 31, 2007, we had no borrowings outstanding on our Canadian Credit Facility. In April 2008, we entered into a new unsecured revolving credit agreement with the National Bank of Canada, which we refer to as our NBC Credit Facility. The terms of this facility will be subject to annual review on March 31 of each year. The NBC Credit Facility is a facility which consists of a line of credit of $40 million Canadian, or $40.3 million United States dollars based on the May 31, 2008 exchange rate, and a line of credit of $5 million United States dollars. We are able to expand the size of the facility to $80 million Canadian on certain Canadian holidays. The NBC Credit Facility is subject to revision and renewal each March 31 and has a variable interest rate based on the National Bank of Canada prime rate. The NBC Credit Facility contains certain financial and non-financial covenants and events of default customary for financings of this nature. We complied with these covenants as of May 31, 2008. We will use the NBC Credit Facility to provide certain Canadian merchants with same day value for their United States and Canadian dollar MasterCard credit card transactions and debit card transactions. As of May 31, 2008, we had $0.1 million of borrowings outstanding on our NBC Credit Facility, based on the exchange rate in effect on that date. During the fiscal year 2008, our Chinese subsidiary in the Asia-Pacific region entered into a revolving credit facility to provide a source of working capital. This credit facility is denominated in Chinese Renminbi and has a variable interest rate based on the lending rate stipulated by the People Bank of China. This facility is subject to annual review up to and including June 30, 2008. As of May 31, 2008, this facility totaled $2.5 million, of which we had $0.6 million of borrowings outstanding, based on the exchange rate in effect on that date. During the fiscal year 2008, our subsidiary in Macau in the Asia-Pacific region entered into a revolving overdraft facility which allows us to fund merchants prior to receipt of corresponding settlement funds from Visa and MasterCard. This is denominated in Macau Pataca and has a variable interest rate based on the lending rate stipulated by The Hongkong and Shanghai Banking Corporation Limited, plus a margin. This facility is subject to review at any time and in any event by January 1, 2009, and subject to overriding right of withdrawal and repayment on demand. As of May 31, 2008, this facility totaled $3.8 million, of which we had $0.9 million of borrowings outstanding, based on the exchange rate in effect on that date. On June 23, 2008, we entered into a new five year, $200 million term loan agreement with a syndicate of banks in the United States. The term loan bears interest, at our election, at the prime rate or London Interbank Offered Rate plus a margin based on our leverage position. As of July 1, 2008, the interest rate on the term loan was 3.605%. The term loan calls for quarterly principal payments of $5 million beginning with the quarter 43 Table of Contents Index to Financial Statements ending August 31, 2008 and increasing to $10 million beginning with the quarter ending August 31, 2010 and $15 million beginning with the quarter ending August 31, 2011. Redeemable Minority Interest We have a redeemable minority interest associated with our Asia-Pacific merchant services channel. Global Payments Asia-Pacific Limited, or GPAP, is the entity through which we conduct our merchant acquiring business in the Asia-Pacific region. We own 56% of GPAP and HSBC Asia owns the remaining 44%. The GPAP shareholders agreement includes provisions pursuant to which HSBC Asia may compel us to purchase, at fair value, additional GPAP shares from HSBC Asia, known as the Put Option. HSBC Asia may exercise the Put Option on the fifth anniversary of the closing of the acquisition and on each anniversary thereafter. By exercising the Put Option, HSBC Asia can require us to purchase, on an annual basis, up to 15% of the total issued shares of GPAP. While not redeemable until July 2011, we estimate the maximum total redemption amount of the minority interest under the Put Option would be $87.4 million, as of May 31, 2008. Off-Balance Sheet Arrangements We have not entered into any transactions with unconsolidated entities whereby we have financial guarantees, subordinated retained interest, derivative instruments, or other contingent arrangements that expose us to material continuing risks, contingent liabilities, or other obligations under a variable interest in an unconsolidated entity that provides us with financing, liquidity, market, or credit risk support other than the guarantee products described under Critical Accounting Estimates below. Commitments and Contractual Obligations The following table summarizes our contractual obligations and commitments as of May 31, 2008: Payments Due by Future Period Total Less than 1 Year 1-3 Years 3-5 Years 5+ Years (in thousands) Operating leases (Note 13) $ 67,446 $ 22,883 $ 28,105 $ 8,642 $ 7,816 Note: This table excludes other obligations that we may have, such as employee benefit plan obligations, and other current and long term liabilities reflected in our consolidated balance sheet and the minority interest put option rights described in Note 13 and 16. We do not have any material purchase commitments as of May 31, 2008. We believe that cash flows from operations and borrowing programs will provide adequate sources of liquidity and capital resources to meet our expected long-term needs for the operation of our business and the satisfaction of these obligations and commitments. Critical Accounting Estimates In applying the accounting policies that we use to prepare our consolidated financial statements, we necessarily make accounting estimates that affect our reported amounts of assets, liabilities, revenues and expenses. Some of these accounting estimates require us to make assumptions about matters that are highly uncertain at the time we make the accounting estimates. We base these assumptions and the resulting estimates on historical information and other factors that we believe to be reasonable under the circumstances, and we evaluate these assumptions and estimates on an ongoing basis. In many instances, however, we reasonably could have used different accounting estimates and, in other instances, changes in our accounting estimates could occur from period to period, with the result in each case being a material change in the financial statement presentation 44 Table of Contents Index to Financial Statements of our financial condition or results of operations. We refer to accounting estimates of this type as critical accounting estimates. The critical accounting estimates that we discuss below are those that we believe are most important to an understanding of our consolidated financial statements. Accounting estimates necessarily require subjective determinations about future events and conditions. Therefore, the following descriptions of critical accounting estimates are forward-looking statements, and actual results could differ materially from the results anticipated by these forward-looking statements. You should read the following in conjunction with Note 1 of the notes to consolidated financial statements and the risk factors contained in Item 1A Risk Factors of this annual report. Reserve for operating losses As a part of our direct merchant credit card and debit card processing services and check guarantee services in the United States, Canada and Asia-Pacific, we experience merchant losses and check guarantee losses, which we collectively refer to as operating losses. Merchant losses occur when we are unable to collect amounts from merchant customers for any charges properly reversed by the cardholder. Check guarantee losses occur when we are unable to collect the full amount of a guaranteed check from the checkwriter. Please refer to the notes to consolidated financial statements for a further explanation of these operating losses. We process credit card transactions for direct merchants and recognize revenue based on a percentage of the gross amount charged. Our direct merchant customers have the liability for any charges properly reversed by the cardholder. In the event, however, that we are not able to collect such amount from the merchants, due to merchant fraud, insolvency, bankruptcy or any other reason, we may be liable for any such reversed charges. We require cash deposits, guarantees, letters of credit and other types of collateral by certain merchants to minimize any such contingent liability, and we also utilize a number of systems and procedures to manage merchant risk. We have, however, historically experienced losses due to merchant defaults. We account for our potential liability relating to merchant losses as guarantees. We estimate the fair value of these guarantees by adding a fair value margin to our estimate of losses. This estimate of losses is comprised of known losses and a projection of future losses based on an assumed percentage of our United States, Canadian, and Asia-Pacific direct merchant credit card and off-line debit card sales volumes processed, or processed volume. For the years ended May 31, 2008, 2007, and 2006, our processed volume was $134.7 billion, $100.1 billion, and $86.4 billion, respectively. For these same periods, we recorded provisions for merchant losses of $5.7 million, $3.1 million, and $2.7 million, respectively. As a percentage of processed volume, these charges were 0.0043%, 0.0031%, and 0.0032%, respectively, during the above periods. For these same years, we experienced actual losses of $5.2 million, $3.3 million, and $3.3 million, respectively. Since actual losses were similar to the merchant loss provisions provided above, we believe that our estimation process has been materially accurate on a historical basis. A 10% increase or decrease in our provision for merchant losses as a percentage of processed volume for the year ended May 31, 2008 would have resulted in a decrease or increase in net income of $0.4 million. Further, if our provision for merchant losses as a percentage of processed volume for our fiscal 2008 had equaled our provision for merchant losses as a percentage of processed volume of 0.0031% for the same prior year period, our net income would have increased by $1.1 million. As of May 31, 2008 and 2007, $3.4 million and $2.8 million, respectively, have been recorded for guarantees associated with merchant card processing and are included in settlement processing obligations in the accompanying consolidated balance sheets. In our check guarantee service offering, we charge our merchants a percentage of the gross amount of the check and guarantee payment of the check to the merchant in the event the check is not honored by the checkwriter bank. We have the right to collect the full amount of the check from the checkwriter but have not historically recovered 100% of the guaranteed checks. Our check guarantee loss reserve is also comprised of known losses and a projection of future losses based on an assumed percentage of the face value of our guaranteed checks. For the years ended May 31, 2008, 2007, 45 Table of Contents Index to Financial Statements and 2006, we guaranteed total check face values of $2.7 billion, $2.6 billion, and $2.5 billion, respectively. For those same periods, we recorded provisions for check guarantee losses of $23.9 million, $18.2 million, and $17.9 million, respectively. As a percentage of the total guaranteed check face value, these charges were 0.90%, 0.70%, and 0.71%, respectively, during the years mentioned above. For these same years, we experienced actual losses of $23.0 million, $18.8 million, and $16.1 million, respectively. Since actual losses were similar to the check guarantee loss provisions provided above, we believe that our estimation process has been materially accurate on a historical basis. A 10% increase or decrease in our percentage assumption for the year ended May 31, 2008 would have resulted in a decrease or increase in net income of $1.6 million. Further, if our guarantee loss as a percentage of guarantee volume for our fiscal 2008 had equaled our guarantee loss as a percentage of guarantee volume of 0.70% for the same prior year period, our net income would have increased by $3.4 million. As of May 31, 2008 and 2007, we had a check guarantee reserve of $6.1 million and $5.1 million, respectively, which is included in claims receivable, net, in the accompanying consolidated balance sheets. We derive our projected loss rate assumptions primarily based on a rolling six month analysis of historic loss activity. These assumptions, however, bear the risk of change, which may occur as a result of several qualitative factors. For merchant losses, these factors include the following: a change in the creditworthiness of our merchant customers; a change in the levels of credit card fraud affecting our merchant customers; and a change in the effectiveness of our internal credit, risk management, and collection departments. For check guarantee losses, these factors include a change in the levels of dishonored consumer checks presented to our guarantee service merchant customers and a change in the effectiveness of our internal check guarantee procedures, customer acceptance and retention policies, or collection protocols. Application of our percentage assumptions involve uncertainty regarding changes in any of the factors above, especially those that are outside of our control, such as the financial health of the United States, Canadian, and the Asia-Pacific regional economies at a regional or national level and the related impact on our customers. Goodwill and long-lived asset valuations We regularly evaluate whether events and circumstances have occurred that indicate the carrying amounts of goodwill, property and equipment, and other intangible assets may warrant revision or may not be recoverable. Goodwill and other indefinite-life intangible assets are evaluated for impairment annually by applying a fair value based test. Property and equipment and finite-lived intangible assets are evaluated for impairment when facts and circumstances indicate the carrying value of such assets may exceed their fair values. When factors indicate that these assets should be evaluated for possible impairment, we assess the potential impairment of their carrying values by determining whether the carrying value of such long-lived assets will be recovered through the future undiscounted cash flows expected from use of the asset and its eventual disposition. We completed our most recent annual goodwill and indefinite-life intangible asset impairment test as of January 1, 2008 and determined that no impairment charges were required as of that date. Other intangible assets primarily represent customer-related intangible assets (such as customer lists and merchant contracts), contract-based intangible assets (such as non-compete agreements, referral agreements and processing rights), and trademarks associated with acquisitions. Customer-related intangible assets, contract-based intangible assets and certain trademarks are amortized over their estimated useful lives of up to 30 years. The useful lives for customer-related intangible assets are determined based primarily on forecasted cash flows, which include estimates for the revenues, expenses, and customer attrition associated with the assets. The useful lives of contract-based intangible assets are equal to the terms of the agreements. The useful lives of amortizable trademarks are based on our plans to phase out the trademarks in the applicable markets. We have determined that the trademarks other than the amortizable trademarks have indefinite lives and, therefore, are not being amortized. For all periods through November 30, 2006, the straight-line method of amortization was employed for all customer-related intangible assets. On December 1, 2006, we adopted the accelerated method of amortization 46 Table of Contents Index to Financial Statements described below which is applied over the respective periods of expected cash flows for our then significant customer-related intangible assets. These particular assets reflected 90% of the carrying value of our total customer-related intangible assets as of November 30, 2006. In determining amortization expense under our accelerated method for any given period, we calculate the expected cash flows for that period that were used in determining the acquired value of the asset and divide that amount by the expected total cash flows over the estimated life of the asset. We multiply that percentage by the initial carrying value of the asset to arrive at the amortization expense for that period. In addition, if the cash flow patterns that we experience are less favorable than our initial estimates, we will adjust the amortization schedule accordingly. These cash flow patterns are derived using certain assumptions and cost allocations due to a significant amount of asset interdependencies that exist in our business. During fiscal 2008, we did not adjust the amortization schedules. We believe that our accelerated method better approximates the distribution of cash flows generated by our acquired customer relationships. We adopted this method prospectively for our existing significant customer-related intangible assets described above and intend to adopt this method for future acquisitions of customer-related intangible assets. The use of this amortization method prior to December 1, 2006 would have resulted in amortization expense that is not materially different from the amount recognized under the straight-line method used by us during the same periods. Lastly, we will continue to use the straight-line method of amortization for the certain customer-related intangible assets that reflected 10% of the carrying value of our total such assets as of November 30, 2006. For these assets, the amortization expense using a straight-line method historically resulted in, and is expected to continue to result in, amortization expense that is not materially different from the amount that would be recognized under the accelerated method of amortization described above. We continue to use the straight-line method of amortization for our contract-based intangibles and amortizable trademarks. The other assets in the accompanying consolidated balance sheets include software rights purchased in September 2001 for $5 million. These rights would allow us to perform certain processing and software support activities that are currently performed on our behalf by a third party. The other assets in the accompanying consolidated balance sheets also include software code with a carrying value of $3.1 million, which allows us to perform certain processing activities currently performed by our other processing platforms. We expect these software assets will be the foundation for two separate projects planned to perform these services internally and with a higher efficiency level. These plans are still in the initial feasibility and design phase as of May 31, 2008. If, in the future, we were to decide to abandon these plans, the value of these assets may be substantially impaired. While we believe that these assets may have a resale value, the maximum potential impairment could equal the carrying value. In our opinion, the carrying values of long-lived assets, including goodwill, property and equipment, and other intangible assets, are not impaired at May 31, 2008 and May 31, 2007. Capitalization of Internally Developed Software We develop software that is used in providing processing services to customers. Capitalization of internally developed software, primarily associated with operating platforms, occurs when we have completed the preliminary project stage, management authorizes the project, management commits to funding the project, it is probable the project will be completed and the project will be used to perform the function intended. The preliminary project stage consists of the conceptual formulation of alternatives, the evaluation of alternatives, the determination of existence of needed technology and the final selection of alternatives. Costs incurred prior to the preliminary project stage are expensed as incurred. Currently unforeseen circumstances in software development could require us to implement alternative plans with respect to a particular effort, which could result in the impairment of previously capitalized software development costs. Costs capitalized during fiscal 2008, 2007 and 2006 totaled $10.2 million, $11.0 million and $11.1 million, respectively. Internally developed software has an amortization period of 5 to 10 years. Internally developed software assets are placed into service when they are complete. 47 Table of Contents Index to Financial Statements Income Taxes The determination of our provision for income taxes requires management judgment in the use of estimates and the interpretation and application of complex tax laws. Judgment is also required in assessing the timing and amounts of deductible and taxable items. We believe our tax return positions are fully supportable; however, we establish liabilities for material tax exposures relating to deductions, transactions and other matters involving some uncertainty as to the proper tax treatment of the item. Issues raised by a tax authority may be finally resolved at an amount different than the related liability. When facts and circumstances change (including a resolution of an issue or statute of limitations expiration), these liabilities are adjusted through the provision for income taxes in the period of change. Judgment will be required to determine whether or not some portion or all of the deferred tax assets will not be realized. To the extent we determine that we will not realize the benefit of some or all of our deferred tax assets, then these deferred tax assets will be adjusted through our provision for income taxes in the period in which this determination is made. 48 Table of Contents Index to Financial Statements
