Item 7. Management Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations. Note numbers refer to the Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements in Item 8. Financial Statements and Supplementary Data. RESULTS OF OPERATIONS We discuss below the results of our operations for fiscal 2010 compared with fiscal 2009 and the results of our operations for fiscal 2009 compared with fiscal 2008. Certain prior period amounts have been reclassified to conform to the current period presentation. We discuss our cash flows and current financial condition under Capital Resources and Liquidity. Outlook Overall, we remain optimistic about the long-term prospects for the worldwide contact lens and women healthcare markets. However, recent events affecting the economy as a whole, including the uncertainty and instability of global markets driven by employment, housing and credit concerns continue to represent a risk to our forecasted performance for fiscal year 2011and beyond. We compete in the worldwide contact lens market with our spherical, toric and multifocal contact lenses offered in a variety of materials including using phosphorylcholine (PC) Technology and silicone hydrogel Aquaform technology. We believe that there will be lower contact lens wearer dropout rates as technology improves thereby enhancing the wearing experience through a combination of improved designs and materials. CooperVision is focused on greater worldwide market penetration as we roll out new products and continue to expand our presence in existing and emerging markets as well as the growth of preferred modalities such as single-use and monthly wearing options. Sales of contact lenses utilizing silicone hydrogel materials, a major product material in the industry, have grown significantly. In the past three years, CooperVision launched monthly silicone hydrogel sphere, toric and multifocal lens products under our Biofinity brand and two-week silicone hydrogel sphere and toric lens products under our Avaira brand. While we believe that we have high quality silicone hydrogel contact lens products, our future growth may be limited by our late entry into the silicone hydrogel segment of the market. For example, competitive silicone hydrogel single-use and multifocal lens products are making substantial gains in market share and represent a risk to our business. We have limited manufacturing capacity for our silicone hydrogel multifocal product and have not yet marketed a silicone hydrogel single-use product. Our ability to compete successfully with a full range of silicone hydrogel products is an important factor to achieving our projected future levels of sales growth and profitability. We are also in the process of developing a number of new contact lens products to enhance CooperVision worldwide product lines. New products planned for introduction over the next two years include additional lenses utilizing silicone hydrogel and PC Technology materials and new lens designs, including multifocal and single-use silicone hydrogel lenses. The medical device segment of the women healthcare market is highly fragmented. CooperSurgical competes based on brand awareness and market focused product offerings, with a strategy that includes identifying and acquiring selected companies and product lines that improve its existing market 37 Table of Contents THE COOPER COMPANIES, INC.

During fiscal 2010, CooperSurgical purchased the Her Option endometrial ablation product line from American Medical Systems Holdings, Inc. Her Option is an FDA approved treatment for women suffering from excessive menstrual bleeding who wish to avoid a hysterectomy. The therapy was designed for in-office use, requires minimal anesthesia and has high patient satisfaction. CooperSurgical also acquired a smoke evacuation system for use during laparoscopic procedures performed in an operating room environment. This system is marketed directly to hospitals. We intend to continue to invest in CooperSurgical business through acquisitions of companies and product lines. We believe that our cash and cash equivalents, cash flow from operating activities and existing credit facilities will fund future operations, capital expenditures, cash dividends, settlement obligations and acquisitions. In connection with the normal management of our financial liabilities, we intend to renegotiate our syndicated Senior Unsecured Revolving Line of Credit that matures on January 31, 2012, and may retire or purchase our Senior Notes through open market cash purchases, privately negotiated transactions or otherwise. Such repurchases will depend on prevailing market conditions, our liquidity requirements, contractual restrictions and other factors. The amounts involved may be material. 2010 Compared with 2009 Highlights: 2010 vs. 2009 Net sales up 7% to $1.2 billion from $1.08 billion in fiscal year 2009. Gross margin 58% of net sales up from 55%. Operating income up 27% to $189.9 million from $149.9 million. Interest expense down 17% to $36.7 million from $44.1 million. Diluted earnings per share up 10% to $2.43 from $2.21. Operating cash flow $267.7 million up 20% from $223.1 million.

AND SUBSIDIARIES Management Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations (Continued) Net Sales Cooper two business units, CVI and CSI, generate all of its sales. CooperVision (CVI) develops, manufactures and markets a broad range of contact lenses for the worldwide vision correction market. Dedicated to enhancing the contact lens experience for practitioners and patients, CooperVision specializes in lenses for astigmatism, presbyopia and ocular dryness. CooperSurgical (CSI) develops, manufactures and markets medical devices, diagnostic products and surgical instruments and accessories used primarily by gynecologists and obstetricians. Our consolidated net sales grew by $78.1 million in 2010 and $33.1 million in 2009. Net Sales Growth ($ in millions) 2010 vs. 2009 2009 vs. 2008 Business unit CVI $ 61.0 7% $ 30.5 3% CSI $ 17.1 10% $ 2.6 2% CVI Net Sales The contact lens market has two major product categories: Spherical lenses including lenses that correct near- and farsightedness uncomplicated by more complex visual defects. Toric and multifocal lenses including lenses that, in addition to correcting near- and farsightedness, address more complex visual defects such as astigmatism and presbyopia by adding optical properties of cylinder and axis, which correct for irregularities in the shape of the cornea. In order to achieve comfortable and healthy contact lens wear, products are sold with recommended replacement schedules, otherwise defined as modalities, with the primary modalities being single-use, two-week and monthly. CVI offers spherical, aspherical, toric, multifocal and toric multifocal lens products in all primary modalities. The market for conventional lenses that are replaced annually has shifted to disposable and frequently replaced lenses. Disposable lenses are designed for either daily, two-week or monthly replacement; frequently replaced lenses are designed for replacement after one to three months. Significantly, the market for commodity spherical lenses has shifted to value-added spherical lenses to alleviate dry eye symptoms as well as lenses with aspherical optical properties or higher oxygen permeable lenses such as silicone hydrogels. CVI Proclear brand aspheric, toric and multifocal contact lenses, manufactured using proprietary phosphorylcholine (PC) Technology, help enhance tissue/device compatibility and offer improved lens comfort. 39 Table of Contents THE COOPER COMPANIES, INC. AND SUBSIDIARIES Management Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations (Continued) CVI markets silicone hydrogel spherical, toric and multifocal lens products under our Biofinity and Avaira brands that are manufactured using proprietary Aquaform technology to increase oxygen transmissibility for longer wear. We believe that it is important to develop a full range of multifocal and single-use silicone hydrogel products due to increased pressure from silicone hydrogel products offered by our major competitors. In fiscal 2010, CVI introduced the following products: Avaira Toric Biofinity Multifocal Net sales growth includes increases in single-use spheres up 12% and total spheres up 9%. Total toric lenses grew 13%, including 24% growth of single-use toric lenses, and multifocal lenses grew 1%. Silicone hydrogel spherical and toric lenses grew 108% worldwide. Proclear products increased 9% driven by growth of single-use lenses. Older conventional lens products and cosmetic lenses declined 14% and 12%, respectively. CVI competes in the worldwide soft contact lens market and services three primary regions: the Americas, EMEA (Europe, Middle East and Africa) and Asia Pacific. CVI Net Sales by Region ($ in millions) 2010 2009 Growth Americas $ 432.8 $ 392.8 10% EMEA 351.8 345.1 2% Asia Pacific 185.9 171.6 8% $ 970.5 $ 909.5 7% CVI worldwide net sales grew 7% in the period-to-period comparison. Americas net sales grew 10%, primarily due to market gains of CVI silicone hydrogel spherical and toric lenses, up 104% in the period, and single-use lenses, up 35%. In our fiscal first quarter of 2010, we recorded $10.1 million of reductions to Americas net sales due to out-of-period adjustments to increase accruals for rebates that were under-accrued in fiscal 2009. EMEA net sales grew 2% in the period driven by increases in sales of silicone hydrogel lenses, up 115% and Proclear 1 Day lenses, up 28%. Net sales to the Asia Pacific region grew 8%, primarily due to sales growth of single-use spherical and toric products, up 9% and silicone hydrogel lenses, up 98%. CVI net sales growth is driven primarily through increases in the volume of lenses sold and introduction of new products, primarily silicone hydrogel lenses. While unit growth and product mix have influenced CVI sales growth, average realized prices by product have not materially influenced sales growth. 40 Table of Contents THE COOPER COMPANIES, INC. AND SUBSIDIARIES Management Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations (Continued) CSI Net Sales CSI net sales increased 10% in the period-to-period comparison to $188.0 million with organic net sales growth of 6%. Sales of products used in surgical procedures grew 18% and now represent 33% of CSI sales compared to 31% in the prior year. Women healthcare products used primarily by obstetricians and gynecologists generate 97% of CSI sales. The balance consists of sales of medical devices outside of women healthcare which CSI does not actively market. Unit growth and product mix along with increased average realized prices on disposable products have influenced organic sales growth. 2009 Compared with 2008 Highlights: 2009 vs. 2008 Net sales up 3% to $1.08 billion from $1.05 billion in fiscal year 2008. Gross margin 55% of net sales down from 58%. Operating income up 18% to $149.9 million from $127.0 million. Interest expense down to $44.1 million from $53.0 million in 2008. Diluted earnings per share up 56% to $2.21 from $1.42. Operating cash flow $223.1 million up 131% from $96.5 million.

CVI achieved 3% net sales growth primarily on growth of disposable lenses, including single-use lenses, and the sale of our silicone hydrogel lenses, Biofinity and Avaira. CSI achieved 2% net sales growth in 2009. 41 Table of Contents THE COOPER COMPANIES, INC.

Americas sales grew 1%, primarily due to market gains of CVI silicone hydrogel spherical and toric lenses, Biofinity and Avaira, PC Technology lenses and single-use lenses. EMEA sales grew 2%, driven by increases in sales of Biofinity spherical and toric lenses and PC Technology lenses, including Proclear 1 Day lenses. Sales to the Asia Pacific region grew 12%, primarily due to sales growth of single-use spherical and toric products and Biofinity lenses. Net sales growth includes increases in single-use spheres up 15%, at $185.5 million, all disposable spheres up 4% and total spheres up 3%. Silicone hydrogel spherical and toric lenses grew 92%. Single-use torics grew 71%, but total torics declined 9% primarily due to a continuing trend in the market toward silicone hydrogel toric lenses. Disposable multifocal lens sales grew 15% to $69.9 million. Older conventional lens products declined 20%, and cosmetic lenses declined 11%. Proclear products increased 6%, including Proclear 1 Day spheres up 59% and Proclear multifocal lenses up 21%. CVI sales growth is driven primarily through increases in the volume of lenses sold as the market continues to move to more frequent replacement. While unit growth and product mix have influenced CVI sales growth, average realized prices by product have not materially influenced sales growth. CSI Net Sales CSI net sales increased 2% to $170.9 million. Women healthcare products used primarily by obstetricians and gynecologists generate 96% of CSI sales. The balance are sales of medical devices outside of women healthcare which CSI does not actively market. While unit growth and product mix have influenced organic sales growth, average realized prices by product have not materially influenced organic sales growth. 42 Table of Contents THE COOPER COMPANIES, INC. AND SUBSIDIARIES Management Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations (Continued) 2010 Compared to 2009 and 2009 Compared to 2008 Cost of Sales/Gross Profit Gross Profit Percentage of Net Sales 2010 2009 2008 CVI 57% 54% 58% CSI 64% 60% 59% Consolidated 58% 55% 58% The increase in CVI gross margin is largely attributable to improvements in manufacturing efficiencies and product mix, primarily the shift to higher margin silicone hydrogel products. CVI gross margin in fiscal 2009 included costs associated with fixed asset write offs; such costs were not significant in fiscal 2010. The gross margin increase was partially offset by costs associated with the 2009 CooperVision Manufacturing restructuring plan, recorded as cost of sales, of $16.0 million for fiscal 2010 compared to $5.0 million for fiscal 2009. As discussed below, these costs are primarily severance charges and accelerated depreciation, and we expect to incur similar costs related to this manufacturing restructuring plan through the fiscal first quarter of 2011. Gross margin for fiscal 2010 reflects the increase in accruals for rebates discussed above. The increase in CSI gross margin for fiscal 2010 is largely attributable to efficiency improvements, changing product mix and to the recognition in the current year of a one-time $1.5 million settlement resolving a vendor dispute. CSI gross margin for the period also reflects higher margins on products used in surgical procedures, that now represent 33% of net sales in the current period compared to 31% in fiscal 2009. Selling, General and Administrative Expense (SGA) ($ in millions) 2010 % Net Sales 2009 % Net Sales 2008 CVI $ 343.0 35% $ 309.9 34% $ 342.5 CSI 61.6 33% 53.7 31% 57.7 Headquarters 28.5 28.0 29.1 $ 433.1 37% $ 391.6 36% $ 429.3 Consolidated SGA increased 11% in fiscal 2010 and decreased by 9% in 2009. The decrease in fiscal 2009 was primarily due to recessionary cost control measures partially offset by costs supporting increased sales levels and contact lenses used in marketing programs. The increase in CVI SGA in fiscal 2010 of 11% in absolute dollars and as a percentage of net sales is primarily due to our increased investment in sales and marketing to reach new customers and to promote our silicone hydrogel products as well as investments in infrastructure such as information technology. CVI SGA in fiscal 2009 included increased efficiencies as a result of the rationalization of distribution centers completed in fiscal 2008, decreased marketing expenses from the prior year that included several new product launches and the Critical Activity restructuring plan discussed below. 43 Table of Contents THE COOPER COMPANIES, INC. AND SUBSIDIARIES Management Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations (Continued) The 15% increase in CSI SGA in fiscal 2010 is primarily due to increased selling and marketing costs to support higher sales and anticipated further growth along with legal expenses related to business acquisitions during the period. CSI decrease in SGA in fiscal 2009 was primarily due to efficiencies from an acquisition including reduced marketing, distribution and other general and administrative costs and decreased legal and share-based compensation expenses. Corporate headquarters SGA increased 2% in fiscal 2010 primarily due to increased legal costs offset by reduced headcount, lower share-based compensation expense and audit costs. The decrease in fiscal 2009 was primarily due to the $1.9 million reduction of accrued legal costs related to our acquisition of Ocular Sciences, Inc. based on a settlement agreement reached in fiscal 2009. Research and Development Expense ($ in millions) 2010 % Net Sales 2009 % Net Sales 2008 CVI $ 29.9 3% $ 28.9 3% $ 30.7 CSI 5.4 3% 4.4 3% 4.8 $ 35.3 3% $ 33.3 3% $ 35.5 CVI research and development expense increased 3% in fiscal 2010 primarily due to investments in new technologies and clinical trials. In fiscal 2009, CVI recorded a $3.0 million in-process research and development charge related to the acquisition of certain distribution rights. Excluding the charge, CVI research and development expenditures grew 16% during fiscal 2010, as compared to the prior year period. CVI research and development activities include programs to develop disposable silicone hydrogel products and product lines utilizing PC Technology. CSI research and development expense increased 23%, primarily due to investments in new products. CSI research and development activities include the upgrade and redesign of many CSI incontinence, assisted reproductive technology and uterine manipulation products and other gynecological and obstetrical product development activities. Restructuring Costs 2009 CooperVision Manufacturing Restructuring Plan In the fiscal third quarter of 2009, CooperVision initiated a restructuring plan to relocate contact lens manufacturing from Norfolk, Virginia, and transfer part of its contact lens manufacturing from Adelaide, Australia, to existing manufacturing operations in Juana Diaz, Puerto Rico, and Hamble, UK (2009 CooperVision Manufacturing restructuring plan). This plan is intended to better utilize CVI manufacturing efficiencies and reduce its manufacturing expenses through a reduction in workforce of approximately 480 employees. CVI completed restructuring activities in Adelaide, Australia, in our fiscal third quarter of 2010 and ceased operations in Norfolk at the end of fiscal 2010. CVI expects to complete restructuring activities in Norfolk in our fiscal first quarter of 2011. 44 Table of Contents THE COOPER COMPANIES, INC. AND SUBSIDIARIES Management Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations (Continued) We estimate that the total restructuring costs under this plan will be approximately $24.3 million, with about $17.3 million associated with assets, including accelerated depreciation and facility lease and contract termination costs, and about $7 million associated with employee benefit costs, including anticipated severance payments, termination benefit costs, retention bonus payouts and other similar costs. These costs will be reported as cost of sales or restructuring costs in our Consolidated Statements of Income. In the year ended October 31, 2010, $16.1 million, including $3.3 million of employee benefits costs and $12.8 million of costs associated with assets, primarily non-cash, are reported as $16.0 million in cost of sales and $0.1 million in restructuring costs. In the year ended October 31, 2009, $5.1 million including $3.6 million of employee benefit costs and $1.5 million of non-cash costs associated with assets are reported as $5.0 million in cost of sales and $0.1 million in restructuring costs. Critical Activity Restructuring Plan In fiscal 2009, CooperVision substantially completed a global restructuring plan to focus the organization on our most critical activities, refine our work processes and align costs with prevailing market conditions (Critical Activity restructuring plan). This restructuring plan involved the assessment of all locations activities, exclusive of direct manufacturing, and changes to streamline work processes. As a result of the Critical Activity restructuring plan, a number of positions were eliminated across certain business functions and geographic regions. The total restructuring costs under this plan were $4.6 million, primarily severance and benefit costs, and were reported as cost of sales or restructuring costs in our Consolidated Statements of Income. In the fiscal year ended October 31, 2010, we reported $0.3 million in restructuring costs and in fiscal 2009, we reported $0.5 million in cost of sales and $3.8 million in restructuring costs. The Company may, from time to time, decide to pursue additional restructuring activities that involve charges in future periods. Amortization of Intangibles Amortization of intangibles was $18.1 million in 2010, $17.9 million in 2009 and $16.8 million in 2008. Amortization expense in fiscal 2009 includes a $1.5 million charge for a CSI license that no longer had value. Operating Income Operating income grew $62.9 million, or 50%, between 2008 and 2010, increasing 27% or $40.0 million in 2010 and 18% or $22.9 million in 2009.

AND SUBSIDIARIES Management Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations (Continued) The increase in operating income in the fiscal 2010 period both in absolute dollars and as a percentage of net sales was primarily due to increased gross margin dollars up 13%, partially offset by increased operating expenses up 9%. Interest Expense Interest expense decreased 17% to $36.7 million in 2010 and decreased 17% to $44.1 million in 2009, following an increase of 16% to $53.0 million in 2008. The fiscal 2010 and 2009 decreases primarily reflect decreases in our long-term borrowings used for capital expenditures and lower interest rates. The fiscal 2008 increase included the write-off of $3.0 million of unamortized costs related to the repurchase of our 2.625% Convertible Senior Debentures, and excluding such costs, interest expense increased 9% in 2008. We had $591.8 million in loans on our credit facility on October 31, 2010, compared to $764.0 million outstanding on October 31, 2009. Settlements The Company and several of its directors and officers were named in a consolidated securities class action lawsuit, the nature and status of which is described in Note 12. Commitments and Contingencies. The Company announced on May 4, 2010, that it has reached an agreement in principle and recorded a charge in our fiscal second quarter 2010 to settle the consolidated class action lawsuit for $27.0 million, which we funded into escrow in our fiscal fourth quarter of 2010. The Court granted preliminary approval of the proposed settlement on August 16, 2010, and final approval on December 13, 2010. The Company has exhausted its insurance coverage in defense of this litigation, and if the settlement were to be overturned as a result of an appeal, general and administrative expenses will increase. The Company is also a nominal defendant in shareholder derivative litigation against several current and former officers and directors of the Company. As described in Note 12. Commitments and Contingencies, an agreement in principle to settle has been reached, which is subject to court approval. This agreement would have the Company pay attorney fees of counsel to the plaintiff in an amount not to exceed $750 thousand but no other amounts. The Company recorded a charge for the settlement amount in our fiscal fourth quarter of 2010. Other (Loss) Income, Net Years Ended October 31, (In millions) 2010 2009 2008 Interest income $ $ 0.4 $ 0.3 Gain on extinguishment of debt 1.8 Foreign exchange (loss) gain (1.2 ) 7.0 0.4 Other income (expense) 0.1 (0.1 ) (0.7 ) $ (1.1 ) $ 9.1 $ 46 Table of Contents THE COOPER COMPANIES, INC. AND SUBSIDIARIES Management Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations (Continued) The fiscal 2009 foreign exchange net gain is primarily due to the U.S. dollar strengthening against other currencies and an initiative we completed in the quarter related to intercompany transactions. In December 2008, we purchased through the open market, in a privately negotiated transaction, $11.0 million in aggregate principal amount of our 7.125% Senior Notes at a discounted price of approximately $9.0 million plus accrued and unpaid interest. We also wrote off approximately $0.2 million of unamortized costs related to the Senior Notes and recorded a gain on the repurchase in other income on our Consolidated Statement of Income. The Company paid the aggregate purchase price from borrowings under its $650.0 million revolving line of credit. Provision for Income Taxes We recorded tax expense of $11.6 million for fiscal year 2010 compared to $14.3 million for fiscal year 2009 based on effective tax rates of 9.3% and 12.4% for 2010 and 2009, respectively. The decrease in the effective tax rate is driven by changes in our geographic mix of income as well as litigation settlement charges incurred in the United States during the period. Share-Based Compensation Plans The Company grants various share-based compensation awards, including stock options, performance shares, restricted stock and restricted stock units. The share-based compensation and related income tax benefit recognized in the consolidated financial statements in fiscal 2010 was $10.2 million and $3.2 million, respectively, compared to $13.0 million and $4.2 million, respectively, in fiscal year 2009. As of October 31, 2010, there was $15.1 million of total unrecognized share-based compensation cost: $5.4 million for stock options; $6.9 million for restricted stock units; and $2.8 million for performance shares. The unrecognized compensation is expected to be recognized over weighted average remaining vesting periods of 2.8 years for nonvested stock options, 2.3 years for restricted stock units and 1.8 years for performance shares. Cash received from options exercised under all share-based compensation arrangements for fiscal 2010, 2009 and 2008 was $11.1 million, $1.1 million and $6.3 million, respectively. The Company estimates the fair value of each stock option award on the date of grant using the Black-Scholes valuation model, which requires management to make estimates regarding expected option life, stock price volatility and other assumptions. The use of different assumptions could lead to a different estimate of fair value. The expected life of the stock option is based on the observed and expected time to post-vesting forfeiture and/or exercise. Groups of employees that have similar historical exercise behavior are considered separately for valuation purposes. If our assumption for the expected life increased by one year, the fair value of an individual option granted in fiscal 2010 would have increased by approximately $1. To determine the stock price volatility, management considers implied volatility from publicly-traded options on the Company stock at the date of grant, historical volatility and other factors. If our assumption for stock price volatility increased by one percentage point, the fair value of an individual option granted in fiscal 2010 would have increased by less than $1. 47 Table of Contents THE COOPER COMPANIES, INC. AND SUBSIDIARIES Management Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations (Continued) The Company estimates stock option forfeitures based on historical data for each employee grouping, and adjusts the rate to expected forfeitures periodically. The adjustment of the forfeiture rate will result in a cumulative catch-up adjustment in the period the forfeiture estimate is changed. These adjustments totaled $1.2 million, $2.9 million and $3.2 million in fiscal years 2010, 2009 and 2008, respectively. The Company grants performance units that provide for the issuance of common stock to certain executive officers if the Company achieves specified long-term performance goals, and vest after three years. The Company estimates the fair value of each award on the date of grant based on the current market price of our stock. The total amount of compensation expense recognized reflects our initial assumptions of the achievement of the performance goals and the estimated forfeiture rates. The Company reviews our assessment of the probability of the achievement of the performance goals each fiscal quarter. If achievement of the goals are not met or it is determined that achievement of the goals is not probable, previously recognized compensation expense is adjusted prospectively to reflect the expected achievement. If we determine that achievement of the goals will exceed the original assessment, additional compensation expense is recognized prospectively. CAPITAL RESOURCES AND LIQUIDITY 2010 Highlights Operating cash flow $267.7 million, compared to $223.1 million in fiscal 2009. Expenditures for purchases of property, plant and equipment $73.8 million, compared to $93.9 million in 2009. Total debt decreased to $611.1 million from $781.5 million in 2009. Cash payments for acquisitions totaled $32.8 million vs. $4.7 million in 2009. Comparative Statistics Years Ended October 31, ($ in millions) 2010 2009 Cash and cash equivalents $ 3.6 $ 3.9 Total assets $ 2,525.0 $ 2,551.9 Working capital $ 291.8 $ 328.5 Total debt $ 611.1 $ 781.5 Stockholders equity $ 1,666.8 $ 1,540.3 Ratio of debt to equity 0.37:1 0.51:1 Debt as a percentage of total capitalization 27% 34% Working Capital The decrease in working capital in fiscal 2010 was primarily due to decreases in inventories and prepaid expenses and other current assets along with increases in accounts payable and short-term debt. The decrease in working capital was partially offset by an increase in accounts receivable. 48 Table of Contents THE COOPER COMPANIES, INC. AND SUBSIDIARIES Management Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations (Continued) Operating Cash Flows Cash flow provided by operating activities continued as Cooper major source of liquidity, totaling $267.7 million in fiscal 2010 and $223.1 million in 2009. Operating cash flow increased primarily due to higher net income and the reduction of inventory arising from higher sales volumes. At the end of fiscal 2010, Cooper inventory months on hand (MOH) were 5.4 compared to 6.3 at fiscal year-end 2009. Our days sales outstanding (DSO) increased to 57 days at October 31, 2010, from 55 days at October 31, 2009. Based on our experience and knowledge of our customers and our analysis of inventoried products and product levels, we believe that our accounts receivable and inventories are recoverable. Investing Cash Flows The cash outflow of $106.6 million from investing activities in fiscal 2010 was for capital expenditures of $73.8 million primarily to improve manufacturing capacity and payments of $32.8 million related to acquisitions. Financing Cash Flows The cash outflow of $161.6 million from financing activities in fiscal 2010 was driven by the $182.5 million net repayments of long-term debt, including the capital lease, along with dividends on our common stock of $2.7 million. The outflow was partially offset by proceeds from short-term debt of $12.1 million and $11.5 million from the exercise of stock options and related tax benefit. Risk Management Most of our operations outside the United States have their local currency as their functional currency. We are exposed to risks caused by changes in foreign exchange, principally our British pound sterling, euro, Japanese yen and Canadian dollar-denominated debt and receivables, and from operations in foreign currencies. We have taken steps to minimize our balance sheet exposure. Although we enter into foreign exchange agreements with financial institutions to reduce our exposure to fluctuations in foreign currency values relative to our debt or receivables obligations, these hedging transactions do not eliminate that risk entirely. We are also exposed to risks associated with changes in interest rates, as the interest rate on our Senior Unsecured Revolving Line of Credit varies with the London Interbank Offered Rate. Our significant increase in debt following the acquisition of Ocular has significantly increased the risk associated with changes in interest rates. We have decreased this interest rate risk by hedging a portion of variable rate debt effectively converting that portion to fixed rate debt for varying periods through May 2011. For additional detail, see Item 1A. Risk Factors and Note 1 and Note 7 to the consolidated financial statements. On January 31, 2007, Cooper entered into a $650 million syndicated Senior Unsecured Revolving Line of Credit (Revolver) and $350 million aggregate principal amount of 7.125% senior notes due 2015 of which $339 million are outstanding (see Note 6 to the consolidated financial statements). KeyBank led the Revolver refinancing, and the Revolver matures on January 31, 2012. 49 Table of Contents THE COOPER COMPANIES, INC. AND SUBSIDIARIES Management Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations (Continued) In connection with the normal management of our financial liabilities, we intend to renegotiate the Revolver, and we may retire or purchase our Senior Notes through open market cash purchases, privately negotiated transactions or otherwise. Such repurchases will depend on prevailing market conditions, our liquidity requirements, contractual restrictions and other factors. The amounts involved may be material. OFF BALANCE SHEET ARRANGEMENTS None. CONTRACTUAL OBLIGATIONS AND COMMERCIAL COMMITMENTS As of October 31, 2010, we had the following contractual obligations and commercial commitments: Payments Due by Period (In millions) Total 2011 2012 & 2013 2014 & 2015 2016 & Beyond Contractual obligations: Long-term debt $ 592.0 $ $ 252.8 $ 339.0 $ 0.2 Interest payments 110.1 28.7 49.2 32.2 Operating leases 170.6 28.6 45.3 25.3 71.4 Total contractual obligations 872.7 57.3 347.3 396.5 71.6 Commercial commitments: Stand-by letters of credit 0.1 0.1 Total $ 872.8 $ 57.4 $ 347.3 $ 396.5 $ 71.6 The expected future benefit payments for pension plans through 2020 are disclosed in Note 11. Employee Benefits. Inflation and Changing Prices Inflation has had no appreciable effect on our operations in the last three fiscal years. New Accounting Pronouncements On November 1, 2009, the Company adopted the Financial Accounting Standards Board (FASB) issued Staff Position No. APB 14-1, Accounting for Convertible Debt Instruments that may be Settled in Cash Upon Conversion (FSP APB 14-1), now included within FASB Accounting Standards Codification 470 (ASC 470), Debt with Conversion and Other Options . ASC 470-20 requires that the liability and equity components of convertible debt instruments that may be settled in cash upon conversion (including partial cash settlement) be separately accounted for in a manner that reflects an issuer nonconvertible debt borrowing rate. As a result, the liability component would be recorded at a discount reflecting its below market coupon interest rate, and the liability component would be accreted to its par value over its expected life, with the rate of interest that reflects the market rate at issuance being reflected in the results of operations. 50 Table of Contents THE COOPER COMPANIES, INC. AND SUBSIDIARIES Management Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations (Continued) This change in methodology affects the calculations of net income and earnings per share but does not increase the cash interest payments. The convertible senior debentures that the Company issued in fiscal 2003 and subsequently repurchased in fiscal 2008 are within the scope of ASC 470-20 and retrospective application to all periods presented is required. Therefore, prior year amounts reflect the cumulative effect adjustment made to the opening retained earnings of fiscal year 2006 as presented in Item 6. Selected Financial Data. The Company has adjusted its reported results in its Consolidated Statement of Income for the year ended October 31, 2008 and its Consolidated Balance Sheet as of October 31, 2009 as follows: Consolidated Statement of Income for the year ended October 31, 2008 As Reported Adjustments As Adjusted (In thousands) Interest expense $ 50,784 $ 2,245 $ 53,029 Provision for income taxes $ 10,731 $ (725 ) $ 10,006 Net income $ 65,476 $ (1,520 ) $ 63,956 Basic earnings per share $ 1.46 $ (0.04 ) $ 1.42 Diluted earnings per share $ 1.43 $ (0.01 ) $ 1.42 Consolidated Balance Sheet at October 31, 2009 As Reported Adjustments As Adjusted (In thousands) Additional paid-in capital $ 1,053,662 $ 9,627 $ 1,063,289 Retained earnings $ 500,078 $ (9,627 ) $ 490,451 On November 1, 2009, the Company adopted ASC Subtopic 350-30-35-5A, Accounting for Defensive Intangible Assets . ASC 350-30-35-5A applies to defensive intangible assets, which are acquired intangible assets that an entity does not intend to actively use but does intend to prevent others from obtaining access to the asset. ASC 350-30-35-5A requires an entity to account for defensive intangible assets as a separate unit of accounting. Defensive intangible assets should not be included as part of the cost of an entity existing intangible assets because the defensive intangible assets are separately identifiable. Defensive intangible assets must be recognized at fair value in accordance with ASC 805 Business Combinations and ASC 820 Fair Value Measurement and Disclosure . ASC 350-30-35-5A is effective prospectively for intangible assets acquired in fiscal years beginning after December 15, 2008, or our fiscal year 2010. The adoption of this guidance did not have a material impact on our consolidated financial statements. On November 1, 2009, the Company adopted the deferred portions of FASB ASC 820, Fair Value Measurements and Disclosures , for its non financial assets and liabilities that are recognized at fair value on a nonrecurring basis, including long-lived assets, goodwill, other intangible assets and exit liabilities. This guidance defines fair value, establishes a framework for measuring fair value under 51 Table of Contents THE COOPER COMPANIES, INC. AND SUBSIDIARIES Management Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations (Continued) generally accepted accounting principles and expands disclosures about fair value measurements. This guidance applies whenever other accounting guidance requires or permits assets or liabilities to be measured at fair value, but does not expand the use of fair value to new accounting transactions. The adoption of this guidance did not have a material impact on our consolidated financial statements. In January 2010, the FASB issued Accounting Standards Update (ASU) 2010-06, which amends ASC 820, Fair Value Measurements and Disclosures : Improving Disclosures about Fair Value Measurements . ASU 2010-06 amends ASC 820 to add new requirements for disclosures about (1) the different classes of assets and liabilities measured at fair value, (2) the valuation techniques and inputs used, (3) the activity in level 3 fair value measurements and (4) the transfers between levels 1, 2 and 3 fair value measurements. ASU 2010-06 is effective for the first reporting period beginning after December 15, 2009, except for the requirement to provide the Level 3 activity of purchases, sales, issuances and settlements on a gross basis, which will be effective for fiscal years beginning after December 15, 2010, and for interim periods within those fiscal years. In the period of initial adoption, entities will not be required to provide the amended disclosures for any previous periods presented for comparative purposes. However, those disclosures are required for periods ending after initial adoption. The Company does not anticipate the adoption of ASU 2010-06, which is partially effective for the Company for the fiscal year beginning on November 1, 2010, will have a material impact on our consolidated financial statements. In February 2010, the FASB issued ASU 2010-09, Subsequent Events (Topic 855): Amendments to Certain Recognition and Disclosure Requirements. This amendment removes the requirement for an SEC filer to disclose a date through which subsequent events have been evaluated in both issued and revised financial statements. Revised financial statements include financial statements revised as a result of either correction of an error or retrospective application of U.S. GAAP. The amendment in the ASU was effective for the Company upon issuance (February 24, 2010). As this guidance relates to removing a disclosure, its adoption had no effect on the consolidated financial statements. On August 1, 2010, the Company adopted ASU No. 2010-11, which is included in the Codification under ASC 815, Derivatives and Hedging . The amended guidance clarifies the scope exception for embedded credit derivative features related to the transfer of credit risk in the form of subordination of one financial instrument to another. The amendments address how to determine which embedded credit derivative features, including those in collateralized debt obligations and synthetic collateralized debt obligations, are considered to be embedded derivatives that should not be analyzed for potential bifurcation and separate accounting as well as under which circumstances embedded credit derivative features would not qualify for the scope exception and would be subject to potential bifurcation and separate accounting. The adoption of this guidance did not have a material impact on our consolidated financial statements. On October 31, 2010, the Company adopted a new accounting standard under ASC 715-20, Compensation Retirement Benefits , that requires additional disclosures about the major categories of plan assets and concentrations of risk for an employer plan assets of a defined benefit pension or other postretirement plan, as well as disclosure of fair value levels, similar to the disclosure 52 Table of Contents THE COOPER COMPANIES, INC. AND SUBSIDIARIES Management Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations (Continued) requirements of the fair value measurements accounting standard (See Note 11). As this guidance only requires enhanced disclosures, which the Company has provided, its adoption did not have a material impact on the consolidated financial statements. Estimates and Critical Accounting Policies Management estimates and judgments are an integral part of financial statements prepared in accordance with accounting principles generally accepted in the United States of America (GAAP). We believe that the critical accounting policies described in this section address the more significant estimates required of management when preparing our consolidated financial statements in accordance with GAAP. We consider an accounting estimate critical if changes in the estimate may have a material impact on our financial condition or results of operations. We believe that the accounting estimates employed are appropriate and resulting balances are reasonable; however, actual results could differ from the original estimates, requiring adjustment to these balances in future periods. Revenue recognition We recognize product net sales, net of discounts, returns, and rebates in accordance with related accounting standards and SEC Staff Accounting Bulletins. As required by these standards, we recognize revenue when it is realized or realizable and earned, based on terms of sale with the customer, where persuasive evidence of an agreement exists, delivery has occurred, the seller price is fixed and determinable and collectability is reasonably assured. For contact lenses as well as CSI medical devices, diagnostic products and surgical instruments and accessories, this primarily occurs upon product shipment, when risk of ownership transfers to our customers. We believe our revenue recognition policies are appropriate in all circumstances, and that our policies are reflective of our customer arrangements. We record, based on historical statistics, estimated reductions to revenue for customer incentive programs offered including cash discounts, promotional and advertising allowances, volume discounts, contractual pricing allowances, rebates and specifically established customer product return programs. The Company records taxes collected from customers on a net basis, as these taxes are not included in net sales. Allowance for doubtful accounts Our reported balance of accounts receivable, net of the allowance for doubtful accounts, represents our estimate of the amount that ultimately will be realized in cash. We review the adequacy and adjust our allowance for doubtful accounts on an ongoing basis, using historical payment trends and the age of the receivables and knowledge of our individual customers. However, if the financial condition of our customers were to deteriorate, additional allowances may be required. While estimates are involved, bad debts historically have not been a significant factor given the diversity of our customer base, well established historical payment patterns and the consistent healthcare needs of patients regardless of the economic environment. Net realizable value of inventory In assessing the value of inventories, we make estimates and judgments regarding aging of inventories and other relevant issues potentially affecting the saleable condition of products and estimated prices at which those products will sell. On an ongoing basis, we review the carrying value of our inventory, measuring number of months on hand and other indications of salability. We reduce the value of inventory if there are indications that the carrying value is greater than market, resulting in a new, lower-cost basis for that inventory. Subsequent changes in facts and circumstances do not result in the restoration or increase in that newly 53 Table of Contents THE COOPER COMPANIES, INC. AND SUBSIDIARIES Management Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations (Continued) established cost basis. While estimates are involved, historically, obsolescence has not been a significant factor due to long product dating and lengthy product life cycles. We target to keep, on average, five to seven months of inventory on hand to maintain high customer service levels given the complexity of our contact lens and women healthcare product portfolios. Valuation of goodwill We account for goodwill and evaluate our goodwill balances and test them for impairment in accordance with related accounting standards. We no longer amortize goodwill. We test goodwill for impairment annually during the fiscal third quarter and when an event occurs or circumstances change such that it is reasonably possible that impairment may exist. We performed our annual impairment test in our fiscal third quarter 2010, and our analysis indicated that we had no impairment of goodwill. The goodwill impairment test is a two-step process. Initially, we compare the book value of net assets to the fair value of each reporting unit that has goodwill assigned to it. If the fair value is determined to be less than the book value, a second step is performed to compute the amount of the impairment. A reporting unit is the level of reporting at which goodwill is tested for impairment. Our reporting units are the same as our business segments CVI and CSI reflecting the way that we manage our business. The fair value of our reporting units is determined using either the income or the market valuation approach or a combination thereof. Under the income approach, specifically the discounted cash flow method, the fair value of the reporting unit is based on the present value of estimated future cash flows that the reporting unit is expected to generate over its remaining life. Under the market approach, the value of the reporting unit is based on an analysis that compares the value of the reporting unit to values of publicly traded companies in similar lines of business. For the current year, management determined the fair value of our reporting units using the income valuation approach. In the application of the income approach, the Company is required to make estimates of future operating trends and judgments on discount rates and other variables. Actual future results related to assumed variables could differ from these estimates. Discount rates are based on a weighted average cost of capital, which represents the average rate a business must pay its providers of debt and equity capital. We used discount rates that are the representative weighted average cost of capital for each of our reporting units, with consideration given to the current condition of the global economy. The discount rates used in the current year are about 200 basis points higher than those used in our analysis for fiscal year 2009 reflecting the current condition of the United States and the global economy. The Company determines net sales forecasts based on our best estimate of near term net sales expectations and long-term projections which include review of published independent industry analyst reports. As a sensitivity analysis, a 100 basis point reduction in the assumed net sales growth beginning in fiscal 2010 and extending through the valuation period would decrease the excess amount of the estimated fair value of each reporting unit over the carrying value but would not cause a change in the results of our impairment testing that indicated that we had no impairment of goodwill. Goodwill impairment analysis and measurement is a process that requires significant judgment. If our common stock price trades below book value per share, there are changes in market conditions or a future downturn in our business, or a future annual goodwill impairment test indicates an 54 Table of Contents THE COOPER COMPANIES, INC. AND SUBSIDIARIES Management Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations (Continued) impairment of our goodwill, the Company may have to recognize a non-cash impairment of its goodwill that could be material, and could adversely affect our results of operations in the period recognized and also adversely affect our total assets, stockholders equity and financial condition. Business combinations We routinely consummate business combinations. Results of operations for acquired companies are included in our consolidated results of operations from the date of acquisition. In fiscal 2009 and prior periods, we allocated the purchase price of acquisitions based on our estimates and judgments of the fair value of net assets purchased, direct acquisition costs incurred and intangibles other than goodwill. In fiscal 2010, based on the FASB revision to the accounting standard for business combinations, we now recognize separately from goodwill, the identifiable assets acquired, including acquired in-process research and development, the liabilities assumed, and any noncontrolling interest in the acquiree generally at the acquisition date fair values as defined by accounting standards related to fair value measurements. As of the acquisition date, goodwill is measured as the excess of consideration given, generally measured at fair value, and the net of the acquisition date fair values of the identifiable assets acquired and the liabilities assumed. Direct acquisition costs are now expensed as incurred. Income taxes We account for income taxes under the asset and liability method. Deferred tax assets and liabilities are recognized for the future tax consequences attributable to differences between the financial statement carrying amounts of existing assets and liabilities and their respective tax bases, and for tax losses and tax credit carryforwards. Deferred tax assets and liabilities are measured using enacted tax rates expected to apply to taxable income in the years in which those temporary differences are expected to be recovered or settled. The effect on deferred tax assets and liabilities of a change in tax rates is recognized in income in the period that includes the enactment date. In assessing the realizability of deferred tax assets, management considers whether it is more likely than not that some portion or all of the deferred tax assets will not be realized. As part of the process of preparing our consolidated financial statements, we must estimate our income tax expense for each of the jurisdictions in which we operate. This process requires significant management judgments and involves estimating our current tax exposures in each jurisdiction including the impact, if any, of additional taxes resulting from tax examinations as well as judging the recoverability of deferred tax assets. To the extent recovery of deferred tax assets is not likely based on our estimation of future taxable income in each jurisdiction, a valuation allowance is established. Tax exposures can involve complex issues and may require an extended period to resolve. Frequent changes in tax laws in each jurisdiction complicate future estimates. To determine the tax rate, we are required to estimate full-year income and the related income tax expense in each jurisdiction. We update the estimated effective tax rate for the effect of significant unusual items as they are identified. Changes in the geographic mix or estimated level of annual pre-tax income can affect the overall effective tax rate, and such changes could be material. Regarding accounting for uncertainty in income taxes, we recognize the benefit from a tax position only if it is more likely than not that the position would be sustained upon audit based solely on the technical merits of the tax position. We measure the income tax benefits from the tax positions that are recognized, assess the timing of the derecognition of previously recognized tax benefits and classify and disclose the liabilities within the consolidated financial statements for any 55 Table of Contents THE COOPER COMPANIES, INC. AND SUBSIDIARIES Management Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations (Continued) unrecognized tax benefits based on the guidance in the interpretation of ASC 740 Accounting for Income Taxes . The interpretation also provides guidance on how the interest and penalties related to tax positions may be recorded and classified within our Consolidated Statement of Income and presented in the Consolidated Balance Sheet. We classify interest and penalties related to uncertain tax positions as additional income tax expense. Share-Based Compensation The Company grants various share-based compensation awards, including stock options, performance shares, restricted stock and restricted stock units. Under fair value recognition provisions, share-based compensation expense is measured at the grant date based on the fair value of the award and is recognized as expense over the vesting period. Determining the fair value of share-based awards at the grant date requires judgment, including estimating Cooper stock price volatility, employee stock option exercise behaviors and employee option forfeiture rates. The expected life of the share-based awards is based on the observed and expected time to post-vesting forfeiture and/or exercise. Groups of employees that have similar historical exercise behavior are considered separately for valuation purposes. In determining the expected volatility, management considers implied volatility from publicly-traded options on the Company stock at the date of grant, historical volatility and other factors. The risk-free interest rate is based on the continuous rates provided by the U.S. Treasury with a term equal to the expected life of the award. The dividend yield is based on the projected annual dividend payment per share, divided by the stock price at the date of grant. As share-based compensation expense recognized in our Consolidated Statements of Income is based on awards ultimately expected to vest, the amount of expense has been reduced for estimated forfeitures. Forfeitures are estimated at the time of grant, based on historical experience, and revised, if necessary, in subsequent periods if actual forfeitures differ from those estimates. If factors change and the Company employs different assumptions in the application of the fair value recognition provisions, the compensation expense that it records in future periods may differ significantly from what it has recorded in the current period. 56 Table of Contents
