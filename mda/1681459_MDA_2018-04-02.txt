ITEM 7. MANAGEMENT S DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS OF FINANCIAL CONDITION AND RESULTS OF OPERATIONS Executive Overview We are a global leader in oil and gas projects, technologies, systems and services. We have manufacturing operations worldwide, strategically located to facilitate efficient delivery of these products, technologies, systems and services to our customers. We report our results of operations in the following segments: Subsea, Onshore/Offshore and Surface Technologies. Management determination of the Company reporting segments was made on the basis of our strategic priorities and corresponds to the manner in which our Chief Executive Officer reviews and evaluates operating performance to make decisions about resource allocations to each segment. A description of our products and services and annual financial data for each segment can be found in Part I, Item 1, Business and Note 22 to our consolidated financial statements in Part II, Item 8 of this Annual Report on Form 10-K. A discussion and analysis of our consolidated results of operations and the results of operations of each of our segments for the years ended December 31, 2017, 2016 and 2015 follows. We focus on economic- and industry-specific drivers and key risk factors affecting our business segments as we formulate our strategic plans and make decisions related to allocating capital and human resources. The results of our segments are primarily driven by changes in capital spending by oil and gas companies, which largely depend upon current and anticipated future crude oil and natural gas demand, production volumes, and consequently, commodity prices. We use crude oil and natural gas prices as an indicator of demand. Additionally, we use both onshore and offshore rig count as an indicator of demand, which consequently influences the level of worldwide production activity and spending decisions. We also focus on key risk factors when determining our overall strategy and making decisions for capital allocation. These factors include risks associated with the global economic outlook, product obsolescence and the competitive environment. We address these risks in our business strategies, which incorporate continuing development of leading edge technologies and cultivating strong customer relationships. Our Subsea segment is primarily affected by trends in deepwater oil and natural gas production. Our Onshore/Offshore segment is affected by commodity prices, population growth and demand for natural gas. Our Subsea and Onshore/Offshore segments benefit through the construction of petrochemical and fertilizer plants, and requirements for new liquefied natural gas facilities, respectively. Our Surface Technologies segment is primarily affected by trends in land-based and shallow water oil and natural gas production, including trends in shale production. We have developed close working relationships with our customers. Our results reflect our ability to build long-term alliances with oil and natural gas companies,and to provide solutions for their needs in a timely and cost-effective manner. We believe that by closely working with our customers, we enhance our competitive advantage, improve our operating results and strengthen our market positions. As we evaluate our operating results, we consider business segment performance indicators like segment revenue, operating profit and capital employed, in addition to the level of inbound orders and order backlog. A significant proportion of our revenue is recognized under the percentage of completion method of accounting. Cash receipts from such arrangements typically occur at milestones achieved under stated contract terms. Consequently, the timing of revenue recognition is not always correlated with the timing of customer payments. We aim to structure our contracts to receive advance payments that we typically use to fund engineering efforts and inventory purchases. Working capital (excluding cash) and net (debt) cash are therefore key performance indicators of cash flows. In each of our segments, we serve customers from around the world. During 2017, approximately 90% of our total sales were recognized outside of the United States. We evaluate international markets and pursue opportunities that fit our technological capabilities and strategies. Business Outlook Overall Outlook The price of crude oil recovered in 2017 when compared to the prior year, and the price has been steadily increased throughout the last six months of the year. Nonetheless, the oil and gas industry continues to experience the overall impacts of the steep decline in crude oil prices that were experienced in prior years and there are some lingering uncertainties in the crude oil price outlook. Despite OPEC implementation of a cap on crude oil production in 2017, ongoing uncertainty in the crude oil price outlook remains due to concerns about the effectiveness and duration of both concurrent OPEC and non-OPEC production cuts, the impact of additional production capacity entering the market due to expanding U.S. shale production, the associated impact on worldwide production, and continued high inventory levels. The sustainability of the 2017 crude oil price recovery and business activity levels is dependent on a number of variables, but many analysts continue to believe the market corrections necessary to address the worldwide oversupply of crude oil are in place and are contributing to sustainable industry improvement. As long-term demand continues to rise and production continues to naturally decline, we believe commodity prices should demonstrate an ongoing ability for continued improvement, increasing both our cash flows and the confidence of our customers to increase their investments in new sources of oil and natural gas production. We 34 witnessed such improvements as we exited 2017 as customers globally were proceeding with final investment decisions at an improved pace over 2015 and 2016. Subsea The impact of the low crude oil price environment over the last two years led many of our customers to reduce their capital spending plans or defer new deep-water projects. We began to reduce our workforce and adjust manufacturing capacity to align our operations with the anticipated decreases in activity in 2016 due to delayed Subsea project inbound orders, and to mitigate the impact to operating margins. We continued such actions in 2017 and we have been realizing the benefits from these restructuring actions by attaining more cost-effective manufacturing. We expect to continue to take additional actions in 2018 as Company activity continues to slow in the near-term, but we are mindful that increased market activity levels are likely to be experienced in 2018 as a result of the improved industry economic environment, which will likely lead to increased order activity going forward. The operational improvements and cost reductions made in 2016, combined with additional actions taken in 2017, have protected operating margins in 2017, while still providing us with the capability to respond to the market recovery that we believe has commenced. We also recognize the need to continue to invest in our people to ensure that we preserve the core competencies and capabilities that delivered strong results in 2017 and will be necessary for continued success during the market recovery. Our customers are continuing to take aggressive actions to improve their project economics and to capitalize upon the improved commodity price environment and we are monitoring customer activity in the context of these improved oil and gas prices. There continues to be risk of project sanctioning delays in the current environment, however, as described above, project economics have improved considerably, and consequently, many offshore discoveries could be developed economically at today crude oil prices. Accordingly, we continue to work closely with our customers and believe that with our unique business model we can further reduce their project break-even levels by offering cost-effective approaches to their project developments, including customer acceptance of integrated business models to help achieve the cost-reduction goals and accelerate achievement of first oil. In the long term, we continue to believe that deepwater development will remain a significant part of our customers portfolios. However, further delays in project sanctions in the near term would unfortunately lead us to take further aggressive actions to ensure our cost base is aligned with the evolving market outlook. Onshore/Offshore The Offshore market faces many of the same constraints as the Subsea business due to lingering industry challenges to improve project economics. Meanwhile, Onshore market activity continues to provide a tangible set of opportunities, and in particular for natural gas projects as natural gas continues to take a larger share of global energy demand. Activity in LNG is fueled by the potential for sustained modest natural gas prices, representing an important opportunity set for our business. We remain confident that the industry will make further LNG investments in the near to intermediate term. We also see opportunities for refining and petrochemical projects. As Onshore market activity levels remain stable, it provides our business with the opportunity to remain actively engaged in and pursue front-end engineering studies that provide the platform for early engagement with clients, which can significantly de-risk project execution. Market opportunities for downstream front-end engineering studies and full EPC projects are most prevalent in the Middle East, Africa and Asia markets in LNG, refining and petrochemicals. Surface Technologies While North America rig count and operating activity have steadily improved since the fall of 2016, the recovery has been somewhat constrained to certain oil and gas producing basins that have the ability to generate acceptable returns. The market recovery began in late 2016 in North America and continued throughout 2017. To our benefit, we have experienced sustained stronger demand for pressure control equipment driven by this increased activity. The pace of improvement is likely to slow in 2018 with expectations of more moderate rig count growth compared to 2017. However, our restructuring actions that were taken in 2016 and 2017 have reduced costs and allowing us to capture the economic benefits of the higher activity levels. Activity in our international surface business has been strengthening, but continues to experience some impact of competitive pricing pressure that began in 2016. Pricing has stabilized and in some geographies improved, but we have not yet witnessed a material recovery. We expect this competitive pricing environment to continue and to have some negative impact on operating margins into the first half of 2018, with the benefit of improved pricing beginning to materialize in the second half of 2018. Pro Forma Results of Operations Unaudited supplemental pro forma results of operations for the year ended December 31, 2016 present consolidated information as if (i) the Merger and (ii) the consolidation of legal onshore/offshore contract entities that own and account for the design, engineering and construction of the Yamal had been completed as of January 1, 2016. The pro forma results do not include any potential synergies, cost savings or other expected benefits of these transactions. Accordingly, the pro forma results should not be considered indicative of the results that would have occurred if the transactions had been consummated as of January 1, 2016, nor are they indicative of future results. Refer to Note 2 and Note 14 to our consolidated financial statements included in Part II, Item 8 of this Annual Report on Form 10-K for further information related to the Merger and Yamal, respectively. Due to the size of the aforementioned transactions relative to the size of historical results of operations and for purposes of comparability, management discussion of the consolidated and segment results of operations are provided on the basis of 35 comparing actual results of operations for the year ended December 31, 2017 to pro forma results of operations for the year ended December 31, 2016. Actual results for the years ended December 31, 2016 and 2015 represent Technip only. 36 CONSOLIDATED RESULTS OF OPERATIONS Year Ended December 31, Change (In millions, except percentages) 2017 2016 Pro Forma** 2016 2015 2017 vs. 2016 Pro Forma 2016 vs. 2015 Revenue $ 15,056.9 $ 19,068.8 $ 9,199.6 $ 11,471.9 $ (4,011.9 ) (21)% $ (2,272.3 ) (20)% Costs and expenses: Cost of sales 12,524.6 16,382.5 7,630.0 9,975.1 (3,857.9 ) (24) (2,345.1 ) (24) Selling, general and administrative expense 1,060.9 1,229.9 572.6 689.6 (169.0 ) (14) (117.0 ) (17) Research and development expense 212.9 219.5 105.4 95.5 (6.6 ) (3) 9.9 10 Impairment, restructuring and other expense 191.5 443.6 343.0 438.1 (252.1 ) (57) (95.1 ) (22) Merger transaction and integration costs 101.8 137.8 92.6 (36.0 ) (26) 92.6 * Total costs and expenses 14,091.7 18,413.3 8,743.6 11,198.3 (4,321.6 ) (23) (2,454.7 ) (22) Other income (expense), net (25.9 ) 12.1 6.5 (102.9 ) (38.0 ) (314) 109.4 106 Income from equity affiliates 55.6 10.9 117.7 51.0 44.7 410 66.7 131 Net interest expense (315.2 ) (29.1 ) (28.8 ) (71.2 ) (286.1 ) (983) 42.4 60 Income before income taxes 679.7 649.4 551.4 150.5 30.3 5 400.9 266 Provision for income taxes 545.5 284.7 180.3 136.5 260.8 92 43.8 32 Income from continuing operations 134.2 364.7 371.1 14.0 (230.5 ) (63) 357.1 * Income (loss) from discontinued operations, net of income taxes (10.1 ) 10.1 100 Net income 134.2 354.6 371.1 14.0 (220.4 ) (62) 357.1 * Less: net income (loss) attributable to noncontrolling interests (20.9 ) 23.6 22.2 0.4 (44.5 ) (189) 21.8 * Net income attributable to TechnipFMC plc $ 113.3 $ 378.2 $ 393.3 $ 14.4 $ (264.9 ) (70)% 378.9 * _______________________ * Not meaningful ** Refer to Pro Forma Results of Operations above for further information related to the presentation of and transactions included in pro forma results for the year ended December 31, 2016. 2017 Compared With 2016 Pro Forma Revenue Revenue decreased $4.0 billion in 2017 compared to the prior-year period on a pro forma basis, primarily resulting from a sharp decline in Subsea activities in the Europe and Africa region due to lower order activity during 2015 and 2016, resulting in a lower backlog of business coming into 2017. The decrease was also attributable to the completion of several projects, combined with lower Subsea vessel utilization. Revenue also decreased across all Onshore/Offshore businesses year-over-year on a pro forma basis, primarily driven by lower levels of project backlog coming into 2017 for the Middle East, North America and South America regions. Gross profit 37 Gross profit (revenue less cost of sales) increased as a percentage of sales to 16.8% in 2017, from 14.1% in the prior-year on a pro forma basis. The improvement in gross profit as a percentage of sales was primarily due to the reduction of cost of sales year-over-year on a pro forma basis as a result of the realization of cost reduction opportunities on certain projects, a lower overall cost structure due to cost reduction and synergy initiatives, the successful progression of several major projects with strong economic performance. and the benefit of a better product and service mix. Selling, general and administrative expense Selling, general and administrative expense decreased $169.0 million year-over-year on a pro forma basis, resulting from lower headcount across all reporting segments, due in part to the benefit of Merger synergies and decreased sales commissions due to the reduced revenue. Impairment, restructuring and other expense Impairment, restructuring and other expense decreased by $252.1 million year-over-year on a pro forma basis. Impairment, restructuring and other expense for 2017 included $157.2 million of restructuring expense and $34.3 million of impairment expense. In the comparable periods, on a pro forma basis, we have implemented restructuring plans across our segments to reduce costs and better align our workforce with anticipated activity levels. Thus, we previously incurred significant restructuring expenses in 2016 on a pro forma basis. In 2017 we continued to align our capacity to expected operating activity levels for 2018 and beyond and we were also negatively impacted by Hurricane Harvey, as a result of which we incurred expenses of $10.9 million due to lost productivity. Merger transaction and integration costs We incurred merger transaction and integration costs of $101.8 million during 2017 due to the Merger. A significant portion of the expenses recorded in the period are related to transaction and leased facility termination fees, with a lower portion but still material related to integration activities pertaining to combining the two legacy companies. Refer to Note 2 to our consolidated financial statements included in Part II, Item 8 of this Annual Report on Form 10-K for further information related to the Merger. Other income (expense), net Other income (expense), net, primarily reflects foreign currency gains and losses. These include gains and losses associated with the remeasurement of net cash positions as well as foreign currency derivatives. During 2017, we incurred $40.1 million of additional net foreign exchange losses compared to 2016. Net interest expense The increase in interest expense was due to the changes in the fair value of a mandatorily redeemable financial liability. During the year ended December 31, 2017, we revalued the liability to reflect current expectations about the obligation and recognized a loss of $293.7 million . Refer to Note 21 for further information regarding the fair value measurement assumptions of the mandatorily redeemable financial liability and related changes in its fair value. Provision for income taxes Our income tax provisions for 2017 and 2016 on a historical basis reflected effective tax rates of 80.3% and 32.7% , respectively . The year-over-year increase in the effective tax rate was primarily due to increases in our valuation allowance due to additional losses generated during the year for which no tax benefit is expected to be realized and an unfavorable change in actual country mix of earnings. In addition, due to U.S. legislation passed in the fourth quarter of 2017, we incurred a one-time deemed repatriation transition tax of $148.7 million and an unfavorable tax provision impact of $18.9 million from the revaluation of the U.S. deferred individual tax assets and liabilities. 2016 Compared With 2015 Revenue Revenues decreased $2,272.3 million compared to the prior-year period, primarily resulting from the Onshore/Offshore segment, which contributed $1,602.2 million to the overall decrease. Onshore/Offshore activities sharply decreased across all geographical areas, specifically Asia Pacific, the Americas and the Middle East. The Subsea segment decreased by $670.1 million , mainly due to decreased activities in the North Sea, which was not fully offset by increased activities in other geographic regions. Gross profit 38 Gross profit (revenue less cost of sales) increased as a percentage of sales to 17.1% in 2016, from 13.0% in the prior-year. The improvement in gross profit was primarily due to a more favorable project mix year-over-year. The components of cost of sales with the largest year-over-year decrease were purchase and construction subcontracting costs for projects and payroll costs. Selling, general and administrative expense Selling, general and administrative expense decreased by $117.0 million year-over-year due to the reduction of total employee headcount and the cessation of non-essential activities. Impairment, restructuring and other expense Impairment, restructuring and other expense decreased by $95.1 million year-over-year. Beginning in 2015, we implemented restructuring plans across our businesses to reduce costs and better align our workforce with anticipated activity levels, which included asset impairments, lease overhangs, appropriate amounts for disputes with some clients, closure costs of subsidiaries and additional amounts on ongoing projects. A significant portion of the restructuring plan was implemented in 2015, giving rise to the decrease in restructuring expense year-over-year. Merger transaction and integration costs We incurred merger transaction and integration costs of $92.6 million primarily during the fourth quarter of 2016 due to the Merger. Refer to Note 2 to our consolidated financial statements included in Part II, Item 8 of this Annual Report on Form 10-K for further information related to the Merger. Other income (expense), net Other income (expense), net, primarily reflects foreign currency gains and losses. These include gains and losses associated with the remeasurement of net cash positions as well as foreign currency derivatives. During 2016, we incurred $123.3 million of additional net foreign exchange gains compared to 2015. The increase was partially offset by net losses from the disposal of assets. Net interest expense The decrease in net interest expense was primarily due to an increase in interest income as well as a slight reduction in other borrowings and bank overdrafts during 2016. Provision for income taxes Our income tax provisions for 2016 and 2015 reflected effective tax rates of 32.7% and 90.6% , respectively . The year-over-year decrease in the effective tax rate was primarily due to decreases in our valuation allowance due to lower losses generated in 2016 for which no tax benefit is expected to be realized and a favorable change in the actual country mix of earnings. 39 OPERATING RESULTS OF BUSINESS SEGMENTS Segment operating profit is defined as total segment revenue less segment operating expenses. Certain items have been excluded in computing segment operating profit and are included in corporate items. Refer to Note 22 to our consolidated financial statements included in Part II, Item 8 of this Annual Report on Form 10-K for further information. We report our results of operations in U.S. dollars; however, our earnings are generated in various currencies worldwide. In order to provide worldwide consolidated results, the earnings of subsidiaries functioning in their local currencies are translated into U.S. dollars based upon the average exchange rate during the period. While the U.S. dollar results reported reflect the actual economics of the period reported upon, the variances from prior periods include the impact of translating earnings at different rates.

Refer to Note 2 to our consolidated financial statements included in Part II, Item 8 of this Annual Report on Form 10-K for further information related to the Merger. 2017 Compared With 2016 Pro Forma Subsea revenue decreased $3.3 billion year-over-year on a pro forma basis primarily due to lower overall activity in the Europe, Africa and North America regions as a result of the reduced backlog from 2015 and 2016. Additionally, the decrease in revenue was attributable to the completion of several projects during the first nine months of 2017 and lower vessel utilization year-over-year on a pro forma basis primarily due to high vessel campaigns in Africa and Asia in the prior year that did not continue into the current year at similar levels. Subsea operating profit as a percent of revenue decreased year-over-year on a pro forma basis due to lower revenue in our Subsea projects business across most Subsea regions. 2016 Compared With 2015 Subsea revenue decreased $670.1 million year-over-year primarily due to decelerating activity in the North Sea after completion of some key projects such as B yla and Sn hvit in Norway. In the Middle East, increased activity was driven by Rashid C in Dubai, United Arab Emirates, while in Asia Pacific activity was driven by the ramp-up of Jangkrik in Indonesia. Meanwhile, Subsea revenues increased in Brazil, primarily due to high-technology supply contracts for the Lula Alto and Iracema Sul pre-salt fields, whereas activity remained stable in the Americas. Subsea operating profit as a percentage of revenue decreased year-over-year primarily a result of a reduced group fleet activity in the North Sea during 2016, despite more offshore operations in West Africa, Asia Pacific and the Middle East during that same period. Meanwhile, manufacturing plants operated at a slightly lower level of activity during 2016 compared to 2015. 40 Onshore/Offshore Year Ended December 31, Favorable/(Unfavorable) (In millions, except %) 2017 2016 Pro Forma 2016 2015 2017 vs. 2016 Pro Forma 2016 vs. 2015 Revenue $ 7,904.5 $ 8,690.0 $ 3,349.1 $ 4,951.3 $ (785.5 ) (9)% $ (1,602.2 ) (32)% Operating profit (loss) $ 810.9 $ 184.5 $ 34.1 $ (313.3 ) $ 626.4 340% $ 347.4 111% Operating profit (loss) as a percent of revenue 10.3 % 2.1 % 1.0 % (6.3 )% 8.2 pts. 7.3 pts. 2017 Compared With 2016 Pro Forma Onshore/Offshore revenue decreased $785.5 million year-over-year. The decrease in revenue was attributable to lower activity in North America, due to the delivery of several projects in 2016 and early 2017, as well as reduced activity in Yamal, partially offset by increases projects in Prelude FLNG and the Middle East. Operating profit and operating profit as a percentage of revenue for the year ended 2017 were both favorable compared to the year ended 2016 on a pro forma basis in comparison and both benefited by successful progression of several major projects, including Yamal and Prelude FLNG, and the successful resolution of certain contract disputes. In addition, the year-over-year performances were favorably impacted by a decrease of $209.7 million related to impairment, restructuring and other expense. 2016 Compared With 2015 Onshore/Offshore revenue decreased $1.6 billion year-over-year. The decrease was sharp across most of the geographic areas primarily as a result of some key projects nearing completion, such as SK 316 and Malikai in Malaysia and Ethylene XXI in Mexico. Elsewhere, revenues were driven by the Juniper project in Trinidad and the Duslo ammoniac plant in Slovakia. Operating profit in the year ended 2016 compared to the year ended 2015 was favorably impacted by a decrease of $113.2 million related to impairment, restructuring and other severance charges. Onshore/Offshore operating profit as a percentage of revenue increased year-over-year primarily due to considerable progress on Yamal as well as cost-saving measures across the segment. Surface Technologies (2) Year Ended December 31, Favorable/(Unfavorable) (In millions, except %) 2017 (1) 2016 Pro Forma 2017 vs. 2016 Pro Forma Revenue $ 1,274.6 $ 1,252.2 $ 22.4 2% Operating profit (loss) $ 82.7 $ (122.0 ) $ 204.7 168% Operating profit (loss) as a percent of revenue 6.5 % (9.7 )% 16.2 pts. _______________________ (1) Due to the Merger, there were 11.5 months included in the year ended 2017 for legacy FMC Technologies, compared with twelve months in 2016. Refer to Note 2 to our consolidated financial statements included in Part II, Item 8 of this Annual Report on Form 10-K. (2) Prior to the Merger, we reported our business in two segments, Subsea and Onshore/Offshore. As a result of the Merger and the addition of FMC Technologies, we began reporting our business in three segments. As such, actual results of operations for 2016 and 2015 do not include Surface Technologies. 2017 Compared With 2016 Pro Forma Surface Technologies revenue increased $22.4 million year-over-year on a pro forma basis. Lower revenue in our surface international, measurement solutions, and loading systems businesses year-over-year on a pro forma basis was more than offset by revenue increase in our surface Americas business. The increase for surface Americas was driven primarily by a higher rig count, which had a positive impact on our flowline and well service pump revenues. Surface Technologies operating profit as a percent of revenue increased year-over-year on a pro forma basis and was driven primarily by increased volume in flowline and well service pump products in our surface Americas business, and a $48.8 million decrease in impairment, restructuring and other severance charges. Corporate Items 41 Year Ended December 31, Favorable/(Unfavorable) (In millions, except %) 2017 2016 Pro Forma 2016 2015 2017 vs. 2016 Pro Forma 2016 vs. 2015 Corporate expense $ (359.2 ) $ (366.6 ) $ (185.9 ) $ (331.9 ) $ 7.4 2% $ 146.0 44% 2017 Compared With 2016 Pro Forma Corporate expense decreased by $7.4 million year-over-year on a pro forma basis. The decrease is primarily attributable to a reduction of business combination transaction and integration costs of $34.4 million in 2017 compared to 2016 on a pro forma basis. 2016 Compared With 2015 Corporate expense decreased by $146.0 million year-over-year primarily due to cost-saving measures instituted at the corporate level. Inbound Orders and Order Backlog Inbound orders Inbound orders represent the estimated sales value of confirmed customer orders received during the reporting period. Inbound Orders Year Ended December 31, (In millions) 2017 2016 Subsea $ 5,143.6 $ 2,384.9 Onshore/Offshore 3,812.9 3,689.0 Surface Technologies 1,239.8 Total inbound orders $ 10,196.3 $ 6,073.9 Order backlog Order backlog is calculated as the estimated sales value of unfilled, confirmed customer orders at the reporting date.

Order backlog for Subsea at December 31, 2017, increased by $1.3 billion from December 31, 2016 primarily due to the Merger. Subsea backlog of $6.2 billion at December 31, 2017, was composed of various subsea projects, including Petrobras pipelay support vessel and pre-salt tree awards; the Eni S.pA. Coral project; Total Kaombo; VNG Fenja; the Mellitah Oil & Gas B.V. Bahr Essalam project; the Woodside Energy Ltd. Greater Enfield project; Statoil Peregrino Phase II; BP Shah Deniz; and Shell Appomattox. Onshore/Offshore. Onshore/Offshore order backlog at December 31, 2017, decreased by $3.7 billion compared to December 31, 2016 . Onshore/Offshore backlog of $6.4 billion was composed of various projects, including Yamal; Emirates National Oil Company Jebel Ali refinery expansion; Total Martin Linge; JSC Sibur Holding Zapsib-2; Eni Ghana onshore receiving gas terminal; the ADNOC Offshore (previously ADMA-OPCO) Umm Lulu Phase 2 project; and Shell Prelude FLNG. Liquidity and Capital Resources Most of our cash is managed centrally and flowed through centralized bank accounts controlled and maintained by TechnipFMC domestically and in foreign jurisdictions to best meet the liquidity needs of our global operations. The majority of cash held by subsidiaries of our U.S. domiciled companies could be repatriated to the United States. Under current U.S. law, as amended by the Tax Cuts and Jobs Act (TCJA), signed into law on December 22, 2017, any such repatriation to the U.S. in the form of a dividend would be eligible for a 100% dividend received deduction and therefore would not be subject to U.S. federal income tax. We expect to meet the continuing funding requirements of our global operations with cash generated by such operations and our existing revolving credit facility. 42 Net (Debt) Cash Net (debt) cash, is a non-GAAP financial measure reflecting cash and cash equivalents, net of debt. Management uses this non-GAAP financial measure to evaluate our capital structure and financial leverage. We believe net debt, or net cash, is a meaningful financial measure that may assist investors in understanding our financial condition and recognizing underlying trends in our capital structure. Net (debt) cash should not be considered an alternative to, or more meaningful than, cash and cash equivalents as determined in accordance with GAAP or as an indicator of our operating performance or liquidity. The following table provides a reconciliation of our cash and cash equivalents to net (debt) cash, utilizing details of classifications from our consolidated balance sheets. (In millions) December 31, 2017 December 31, 2016 Cash and cash equivalents $ 6,737.4 $ 6,269.3 Short-term debt and current portion of long-term debt (77.1 ) (683.6 ) Long-term debt, less current portion (3,777.9 ) (1,869.3 ) Net cash $ 2,882.4 $ 3,716.4 The gross change in the debt and cash components of our net (debt) cash position was primarily due to the Merger. Refer to Note 2 to our consolidated financial statements included in Part II, Item 8 of this Annual Report on Form 10-K for further information related to the Merger. Cash Flows Cash flows for each of the years in the three-year period ended December 31, 2017, were as follows: Year Ended December 31, (In millions) 2017 2016 2015 Cash provided by operating activities $ 210.7 $ 493.8 $ 700.3 Cash provided (required) by investing activities 1,250.0 3,110.5 (335.1 ) Cash required by financing activities (1,054.8 ) (534.6 ) (127.2 ) Effect of exchange rate changes on cash and cash equivalents 62.2 21.6 (320.6 ) Increase (decrease) in cash and cash equivalents $ 468.1 $ 3,091.3 $ (82.6 ) Operating cash flows During 2017, we generated $210.7 million in cash flows from operating activities, which was a $283.1 million decrease compared to 2016. Our cash flows from operating activities in 2016 were $206.5 million lower than 2015. The decrease in cash provided by operating activities in 2017 was due to the change in accounts payables and advance payments and billings in excess of costs slightly offset by the change in trade receivables, net and costs in excess of billings. The year-over-year decrease in 2016 was due to the change in trade receivables, net and costs in excess of billings. Our working capital balances can vary significantly depending on the payment and delivery terms on key contracts in our portfolio of projects. Investing cash flows Investing activities provided $1.3 billion in 2017 primarily due to the Merger. Refer to Note 2 to our consolidated financial statements included in Part II, Item 8 of this Annual Report on Form 10-K for further information related to the Merger. Cash provided by investing activities in 2016 was $3.1 billion , primarily reflecting cash acquired through an acquisition. Refer to Note 8 to our consolidated financial statements included in Part II, Item 8 of this Annual Report on Form 10-K for further information related to the acquisition and consolidation of legal onshore/offshore contract entities that own and account for Yamal. Our cash requirements for investing activities in 2015 were $335.1 million , primarily reflecting capital expenditures. Financing cash flows Financing activities used $1.1 billion in 2017. The increase of $520.2 million in cash required for financing activities was primarily due to a decrease in proceeds from the issuance of long-term debt in 2016, an increase in settlements on mandatorily redeemable liability, and an increase in payments of taxes withheld on share-based compensation, offset by increased borrowings of our commercial paper during 2017. Financing activities used $534.6 million in 2016. The increase of $407.4 million in cash required for financing activities from 2015 was driven by the increase in net repayments of $59.1 million long-term debt as well as $186.8 million of treasury share purchases during 2016. Debt and Liquidity Total borrowings at December 31, 2017 and 2016, comprised the following: 43 (In millions) December 31, 2017 December 31, 2016 Revolving credit facility $ $ Bilateral credit facilities Commercial paper 1,450.4 210.8 Synthetic bonds due 2021 502.4 431.8 Convertible bonds due 2017 524.5 3.45% Senior Notes due 2022 500.0 5.00% Notes due 2020 239.9 210.8 3.40% Notes due 2022 179.9 158.1 3.15% Notes due 2023 155.9 137.0 3.15% Notes due 2023 149.9 131.8 4.00% Notes due 2027 89.9 79.1 4.00% Notes due 2032 119.9 105.4 3.75% Notes due 2033 119.9 105.4 Bank borrowings 332.5 452.1 Other 28.2 20.3 Unamortized debt issuance costs and discounts (13.8 ) (14.2 ) Total borrowings $ 3,855.0 $ 2,552.9 The following is a summary of our revolving credit facility at December 31, 2017: (In millions) Description Amount Debt Outstanding Commercial Paper Outstanding (a) Letters of Credit Unused Capacity Maturity Five-year revolving credit facility $ 2,500.0 $ $ 1,450.4 $ $ 1,049.6 January 2022 ______________________________ (a) Under our commercial paper program, we have the ability to access up to $1.5 billion and 1.0 billion of financing through our commercial paper dealers. Our available capacity under our revolving credit facility is reduced by any outstanding commercial paper. Committed credit available under our revolving credit facility provides the ability to issue our commercial paper obligations on a long-term basis. We had $1,450.4 million of commercial paper issued under our facility at December 31, 2017. As we had both the ability and intent to refinance these obligations on a long-term basis, our commercial paper borrowings were classified as long-term debt in the accompanying consolidated balance sheets at December 31, 2017. Our revolving credit facility contains customary covenants as defined by the credit facility agreement which includes a financial covenant requiring that our total capitalization ratio not exceed 60% at the end of any financial quarter. The facility agreement also contains covenants restricting our ability and our subsidiaries ability to incur additional liens and indebtedness, enter into asset sales, make certain investments. As of December 31, 2017, we were in compliance with all restrictive covenants under our revolving credit facility. Refer to Note 13 and Note 14 to our consolidated financial statements included in Part II, Item 8 of this Annual Report on Form 10-K for further information related to our credit facility and our mandatorily redeemable liability, respectively. Credit Risk Analysis Valuations of derivative assets and liabilities reflect the fair value of the instruments, including the values associated with counterparty risk. These values must also take into account our credit standing, thus including in the valuation of the derivative instrument the value of the net credit differential between the counterparties to the derivative contract. Our methodology includes the impact of both counterparty and our own credit standing. Adjustments to our derivative assets and liabilities related to credit risk were not material for any period presented. We use the income approach as the valuation technique to measure the fair value of foreign currency derivative instruments on a recurring basis. This approach calculates the present value of the future cash flow by measuring the change from the derivative contract rate and the published market indicative currency rate, multiplied by the contract notional values. Credit risk 44 is then incorporated by reducing the derivative fair value in asset positions by the result of multiplying the present value of the portfolio by the counterparty published credit spread. Portfolios in a liability position are adjusted by the same calculation; however, a spread representing our credit spread is used. Our credit spread, and the credit spread of other counterparties not publicly available are approximated by using the spread of similar companies in the same industry, of similar size and with the same credit rating. At this time, we have no credit-risk-related contingent features in our agreements with the financial institutions that would require us to post collateral for derivative positions in a liability position . Additional information about credit risk is incorporated herein by reference to Note 21 to our consolidated financial statements included in Part II, Item 8 of this Annual Report on Form 10-K. Outlook Historically, we have generated our liquidity and capital resources primarily through operations and, when needed, through our credit facility. We have $1,049.6 million of capacity available under our revolving credit facility that we expect to utilize if working capital needs temporarily increase. The volatility in credit, equity and commodity markets creates some uncertainty for our business. However, management believes, based on our current financial condition, existing backlog levels and current expectations for future market conditions, that we will continue to meet our short- and long-term liquidity needs with a combination of cash on hand, cash generated from operations and access to capital markets. While we will continue to reach payment milestones on our projects, we expect our consolidated operating cash flow in 2018 to decrease as a result of the negative impact of the decline in commodity prices and the corresponding impact the industry downturn has had on our overall business in terms of the number of new projects awarded and the payment terms and conditions of such project awards during 2016 and 2017. Consequently, any payment deferrals or discounts on pricing granted to clients in prior years may adversely affect our results of operations and cash flows in 2018 and beyond. We project spending approximately $300 million in 2018 for capital expenditures, largely on expenditures in our subsea service business. However, projected capital expenditures for 2018 does not include any contingent capital that may be needed to respond to a contract award. We implemented a U.K. court-approved reduction of our capital, which completed on June 29, 2017, in order to create distributable profits to support the payment of future dividends or future share repurchases. Our board of directors authorized $500 million for the repurchase of shares which was executed over the remainder of 2017 and will be completed in 2018. Also, on October 25, 2017, it was announced that our Board of Directors authorized and declared an initial quarterly cash dividend of $0.13 per ordinary share. During 2018, we expect to make contributions of approximately $19.9 million to our pension plans. Actual contribution amounts are dependent upon plan investment returns, changes in pension obligations, regulatory environments and other economic factors. We update our pension estimates annually during the fourth quarter or more frequently upon the occurrence of significant events. Additionally, we expect to make payments of approximately $5.3 million to our U.S. Non-Qualified Defined Benefit Pension Plan during 2018. Contractual Obligations The following is a summary of our contractual obligations at December 31, 2017 : Payments Due by Period (In millions) Contractual obligations Total payments Less than 1 year 1-3 years 3 -5 years After 5 years Debt (a) $ 3,855.0 $ 77.1 $ 1,972.9 $ 1,179.0 $ 626.0 Interest on debt (a) 409.4 62.6 125.2 96.5 125.1 Operating leases (b) 1,783.6 347.2 556.4 302.9 577.1 Purchase obligations (c) 5,263.4 4,140.2 912.8 11.7 198.7 Pension and other post-retirement benefits (d) 25.2 25.2 Unrecognized tax benefits (e) 96.3 96.3 Other contractual obligations (f) $ 312.0 $ 69.7 $ 151.6 $ 70.0 $ 20.7 Total contractual obligations $ 11,744.9 $ 4,818.3 $ 3,718.9 $ 1,660.1 $ 1,547.6 ______________________________ 45 (a) Our available debt is dependent upon our compliance with covenants, including negative covenants related to liens and our total capitalization ratio. Any violation of covenants or other events of default, which are not waived or cured, or changes in our credit rating could have a material impact on our ability to maintain our committed financing arrangements. Due to our intent and ability to refinance commercial paper obligations on a long-term basis under our revolving credit facility and the variable interest rates associated with these debt instruments, only interest on our Senior Notes is included in the table. During 2017 , we paid $50.3 million for interest charges, net of interest capitalized. (b) In 2014 we entered into construction and operating lease agreements to finance the construction of manufacturing and office facilities located in Houston, TX. In January 2016, construction of the facilities was completed and the operating lease commenced. Upon expiration of the lease term in September 2021, we have the option to renew the lease, purchase the facilities or re-market the facilities on behalf of the lessor, including certain guarantees of residual value under the re-marketing option. (c) In the normal course of business, we enter into agreements with our suppliers to purchase raw materials or services. These agreements include a requirement that our supplier provide products or services to our specifications and require us to make a firm purchase commitment to our supplier. As substantially all of these commitments are associated with purchases made to fulfill our customers orders, the costs associated with these agreements will ultimately be reflected in cost of sales on our consolidated statements of income. (d) We expect to contribute approximately $ 19.9 million to our international pension plans during 2018. Required contributions for future years depend on factors that cannot be determined at this time. Additionally, we expect to contribute $5.3 million to our U.S. Non-Qualified Defined Benefit Pension Plan in 2018. (e) It is reasonably possible that $96.3 million of liabilities for unrecognized tax benefits will be settled during 2018, and this amount is reflected in income taxes payable in our consolidated balance sheet as of December 31, 2017 . Although unrecognized tax benefits are not contractual obligations, they are presented in this table because they represent demands on our liquidity. (f) Other contractual obligations represent a mandatorily redeemable financial liability. In the fourth quarter of 2016, we obtained voting control interests in legal onshore/offshore contract entities which own and account for the design, engineering and construction of the Yamal LNG plant. Prior to the amendments of the contractual terms that provided us with voting interest control, we accounted for these entities under the equity method of accounting based on our previously held interests in each of these entities. A mandatorily redeemable financial liability of $174.8 million was recognized as of December 31, 2016 to account for the fair value of the non-controlling interests. During the year ended December 31, 2017 we revalued the liability to reflect current expectations about the obligation. Refer to Note 22 for further information regarding the fair value measurement assumptions of the mandatorily redeemable financial liability and related changes in its fair v alue. Other Off-Balance Sheet Arrangements The following is a summary of other off-balance sheet arrangements at December 31, 2017: Amount of Commitment Expiration per Period (In millions) Other off-balance sheet arrangements Total amount Less than 1 year 1-3 years 3-5 years After 5 years Letters of credit and bank guarantees (a) $ 4,566.4 $ 2,174.4 $ 2,164.4 $ 185.1 $ 42.5 Surety bonds (a) 37.2 29.7 7.5 Total other off-balance sheet arrangements $ 4,603.6 $ 2,204.1 $ 2,171.9 $ 185.1 $ 42.5 ______________________________ (a) As collateral for our performance on certain sales contracts or as part of our agreements with insurance companies, we are liable under letters of credit, surety bonds and other bank guarantees. Our ability to generate revenue from certain contracts is dependent upon our ability to obtain these off-balance sheet financial instruments. These off-balance sheet financial instruments may be renewed, revised or released based on changes in the underlying commitment. Historically, our commercial commitments have not been drawn upon to a material extent; consequently, management believes it is not reasonably likely there will be material claims against these commitments. However, should these financial instruments become unavailable to us, our operations and liquidity could be negatively impacted. Critical Accounting Estimates The preparation of financial statements in conformity with GAAP requires management to make certain estimates, judgments and assumptions about future events that affect the reported amounts of assets and liabilities at the date of the financial statements, the reported amounts of revenue and expenses during the periods presented and the related disclosures in the accompanying notes to the financial statements. Management has reviewed these critical accounting estimates with the Audit Committee of our Board of Directors. We believe the following critical accounting estimates used in preparing our financial statements address all important accounting areas where the nature of the estimates or assumptions is material due to the levels of subjectivity and judgment necessary to account for highly uncertain matters or the susceptibility of such matters to change. 46 See Note 1 to our consolidated financial statements included in Part II, Item 8 of this Annual Report on Form 10-K for a description of our significant accounting policies. Percentage of Completion Method of Accounting We recognize revenue on construction-type projects using the percentage of completion method of accounting whereby revenue is recognized as work progresses on each contract. There are several acceptable methods under GAAP of measuring progress toward completion. Most frequently, we use the ratio of costs incurred to date to total estimated contract costs at completion to measure progress toward completion. We also use alternative methods including physical progress or others depending on the type of project. We execute contracts with our customers that clearly describe the equipment, systems and/or services that we will provide and the amount of consideration we will receive. After analyzing the drawings and specifications of the contract requirements, our project engineers estimate total contract costs based on their experience with similar projects and then adjust these estimates for specific risks associated with each project, such as technical risks associated with a new design. Costs associated with specific risks are estimated by assessing the probability that conditions arising from these specific risks will affect our total cost to complete the project. After work on a project begins, assumptions that form the basis for our calculation of total project cost are examined on a regular basis and our estimates are updated to reflect the most current information and management best judgment. Revenue recognized using the percentage of completion method of accounting was approximately 79.0%, 84.9% and 83.9% of total revenue recognized for the years ended December 31, 2017, 2016 and 2015, respectively. A significant portion of our total revenue recognized under the percentage of completion method of accounting relates to our Onshore/Offshore and Subsea segments, primarily for the entire range of onshore facilities, fixed and floating offshore oil and gas facilities and subsea exploration and production equipment projects that involve the design, engineering, manufacturing, construction, and assembly of complex, customer-specific systems. Total estimated contract cost affects both the revenue recognized in a period as well as the reported profit or loss on a project. The determination of profit or loss on a contract requires consideration of contract revenue, change orders and claims, less costs incurred to date and estimated costs to complete. Profits are recognized based on the estimated project profit multiplied by the percentage complete. Adjustments to estimates of contract revenue, total contract cost, or extent of progress toward completion are often required as work progresses under the contract and as experience is gained, even though the scope of work required under the contract may not change. The nature of accounting for contracts under the percentage of completion method of accounting is such that refinements of the estimating process for changing conditions and new developments are continuous and characteristic of the process. Consequently, the amount of revenue recognized using the percentage of completion method of accounting is sensitive to changes in our estimates of total contract costs. For each contract in progress at December 31, 2017, a 1% increase or decrease in the estimated margin earned on each contract would have increased or decreased total revenue and pre-tax income by $194.6 million for the year ended December 31, 2017. The total estimated contract cost in the percentage of completion method of accounting is a critical accounting estimate because it can materially affect revenue and profit and requires us to make judgments about matters that are uncertain. There are many factors, including, but not limited to, the ability to properly execute the engineering and design phases consistent with our customers expectations, the availability and costs of labor and material resources, productivity and weather, that can affect the accuracy of our cost estimates, and ultimately, our future profitability. Changes in these factors may result in revisions to costs and income, and their effects are recognized in the period in which the revisions are determined. These factors are routinely evaluated on a project by project basis throughout the project term, and the impact of corresponding revisions in management estimates of contract value, contract cost and contract profit are recorded as necessary in the period in which the revisions are determined. Our operating profit for the year ended December 31, 2017 was positively impacted by approximately $378.4 million, as a result of changes in contract estimates related to projects that were in progress at December 31, 2016. During the year ended December 31, 2017, we recognized favorable changes in our estimates which had an impact on our margin in the amounts of $325 million and $53.4 million in our Onshore/Offshore and Subsea segment s, respectively. The changes in contract estimates are attributed to better than expected performance throughout our execution of our projects. Accounting for Income Taxes Our income tax expense, deferred tax assets and liabilities, and reserves for uncertain tax positions reflect management best assessment of estimated future taxes to be paid. We are subject to income taxes in the United Kingdom and numerous foreign jurisdictions. Significant judgments and estimates are required in determining our consolidated income tax expense. In determining our current income tax provision, we assess temporary differences resulting from differing treatments of items for tax and accounting purposes. These differences result in deferred tax assets and liabilities, which are recorded in our 47 consolidated balance sheets. When we maintain deferred tax assets, we must assess the likelihood that these assets will be recovered through adjustments to future taxable income. To the extent, we believe recovery is not likely, we establish a valuation allowance. We record a valuation allowance to reduce the asset to a value we believe will be recoverable based on our expectation of future taxable income. We believe the accounting estimate related to the valuation allowance is a critical accounting estimate because it is highly susceptible to change from period to period, requires management to make assumptions about our future income over the lives of the deferred tax assets, and finally, the impact of increasing or decreasing the valuation allowance is potentially material to our results of operations. Forecasting future income requires us to use a significant amount of judgment. In estimating future income, we use our internal operating budgets and long-range planning projections. We develop our budgets and long-range projections based on recent results, trends, economic and industry forecasts influencing our segments performance, our backlog, planned timing of new product launches and customer sales commitments. Significant changes in our judgment related to the expected realizability of a deferred tax asset results in an adjustment to the associated valuation allowance. As of December 31, 2017, we believe that it is not more likely than not that we will generate future taxable income in certain jurisdictions in which we have cumulative net operating losses and, therefore, we have provided a valuation allowance against the related deferred tax assets. The calculation of our income tax expense involves dealing with uncertainties in the application of complex tax laws and regulations in numerous jurisdictions in which we operate. We recognize tax benefits related to uncertain tax positions when, in our judgment, it is more likely than not that such positions will be sustained on examination, including resolutions of any related appeals or litigation, based on the technical merits. We adjust our liabilities for uncertain tax positions when our judgment changes as a result of new information previously unavailable. Due to the complexity of some of these uncertainties, their ultimate resolution may result in payments that are materially different from our current estimates. Any such differences will be reflected as adjustments to income tax expense in the periods in which they are determined. We are currently evaluating provisions of United States and French tax reform enacted in December 2017. In the fourth quarter of 2017, we recorded a provision to income taxes for our preliminary assessment of the impact of tax reform. As we do not have all the necessary information to analyze all income tax effects of tax reform, this is a provisional amount which we believe represents a reasonable estimate of the accounting implications of this tax reform. We will continue to evaluate tax reform and adjust the provisional amounts as additional information is obtained. The ultimate impact of tax reform may differ from our provisional amounts due to changes in our interpretations and assumptions, as well as additional regulatory guidance that may be issued. We expect to complete our detailed analysis no later than the fourth quarter of 2018. For further information, see Note 17 to the consolidated financial statements. Accounting for Pension and Other Post-retirement Benefit Plans Our pension and other post-retirement (health care and life insurance) obligations are described in Note 18 to our consolidated financial statements included in Part II, Item 8 of this Annual Report on Form 10-K. The determination of the projected benefit obligations of our pension and other post-retirement benefit plans are important to the recorded amounts of such obligations on our consolidated balance sheet and to the amount of pension expense in our consolidated statements of income. In order to measure the obligations and expense associated with our pension benefits, management must make a variety of estimates, including discount rates used to value certain liabilities, expected return on plan assets set aside to fund these costs, rate of compensation increase, employee turnover rates, retirement rates, mortality rates and other factors. We update these estimates on an annual basis or more frequently upon the occurrence of significant events. These accounting estimates bear the risk of change due to the uncertainty and difficulty in estimating these measures. Different estimates used by management could result in our recognition of different amounts of expense over different periods of time. Due to the specialized and statistical nature of these calculations which attempt to anticipate future events, we engage third-party specialists to assist management in evaluating our assumptions as well as appropriately measuring the costs and obligations associated with these pension benefits. The discount rate and expected long-term rate of return on plan assets are primarily based on investment yields available and the historical performance of our plan assets, respectively. These measures are critical accounting estimates because they are subject to management judgment and can materially affect net income. The discount rate affects the interest cost component of net periodic pension cost and the calculation of the projected benefit obligation. The discount rate is based on rates at which the pension benefit obligation could be effectively settled on a present value basis. Discount rates are derived by identifying a theoretical settlement portfolio of long-term, high quality ( AA rated) corporate bonds at our determination date that is sufficient to provide for the projected pension benefit payments. A single discount rate is determined that results in a discounted value of the pension benefit payments that equate to the market value of the selected bonds. The resulting discount rate is reflective of both the current interest rate environment and the pension distinct liability characteristics. Significant changes in the discount rate, such as those caused by changes in the yield curve, the 48 mix of bonds available in the market, the duration of selected bonds and the timing of expected benefit payments, may result in volatility in our pension expense and pension liabilities. The expected long-term rate of return on plan assets is a component of net periodic pension cost. Our estimate of the expected long-term rate of return on plan assets is primarily based on the historical performance of plan assets, current market conditions, our asset allocation and long-term growth expectations. The difference between the expected return and the actual return on plan assets is amortized over the expected remaining service life of employees, resulting in a lag time between the market performance and its impact on plan results. Holding other assumptions constant, the following table illustrates the sensitivity of changes in the discount rate and expected long-term return on plan assets on pension expense and the projected benefit obligation: (In millions, except basis points) Increase (Decrease) in 2017 Pension Expense Before Income Taxes Increase (Decrease) in Projected Benefit Obligation at December 31, 2017 25 basis point decrease in discount rate $ (0.1 ) $ 62.9 25 basis point increase in discount rate $ $ (59.0 ) 25 basis point decrease in expected long-term rate of return on plan assets $ 3.1 $ 25 basis point increase in expected long-term rate of return on plan assets $ (3.1 ) $ The actuarial assumptions and estimates made by management in determining our pension benefit obligations may materially differ from actual results as a result of changing market and economic conditions and changes in plan participant assumptions. While we believe the assumptions and estimates used are appropriate, differences in actual experience or changes in plan participant assumptions may materially affect our financial position or results of operations. Determination of Fair Value in Business Combinations Accounting for the acquisition of a business requires the allocation of the purchase price to the various assets acquired and liabilities assumed at their respective fair values. The determination of fair value requires the use of significant estimates and assumptions, and in making these determinations, management uses all available information. If necessary, we have up to one year after the acquisition closing date to finalize these fair value determinations. For tangible and identifiable intangible assets acquired in a business combination, the determination of fair value utilizes several valuation methodologies including discounted cash flows which has assumptions with respect to the timing and amount of future revenue and expenses associated with an asset. The assumptions made in performing these valuations include, but are not limited to, discount rates, future revenues and operating costs, projections of capital costs, and other assumptions believed to be consistent with those used by principal market participants. Due to the specialized nature of these calculations, we engage third-party specialists to assist management in evaluating our assumptions as well as appropriately measuring the fair value of assets acquired and liabilities assumed. Business combinations are described in Note 2 to our consolidated financial statements included in Part II, Item 8 of this Annual Report on Form 10-K. Inventory Valuation Inventory is recorded at the lower of cost or net realizable value. We evaluate the components of inventory on a regular basis for excess and obsolescence. We record the decline in the carrying value of estimated excess or obsolete inventory as a reduction of inventory and as an expense included in cost of sales in the period in which it is identified. Our estimate of excess and obsolete inventory is a critical accounting estimate because it is highly susceptible to change from period to period. In addition, the estimate requires management to make judgments about the future demand for inventory. In order to quantify excess or obsolete inventory, we begin by preparing a candidate listing of the components of inventory that have a quantity on hand in excess of usage within the most recent two-year period. The list is reviewed with sales, engineering, production and materials management personnel to determine whether the list of potential excess or obsolete inventory items is accurate. As part of this evaluation, management considers whether there has been a change in the market for finished goods, whether there will be future demand for on-hand inventory items and whether there are components of inventory that incorporate obsolete technology. Finally, an assessment is made of our historical usage of inventory previously written off as excess or obsolete, and a further adjustment to the estimate is made based on this historical experience. As a result, our estimate of excess or obsolete inventory is sensitive to changes in assumptions about future usage of inventory. Factors that could materially impact our estimate include changes in crude oil prices and its effect on the longevity of the current industry downturn, which would impact the demand for our products and services, as well as changes in the pattern of demand for the products that we offer. We believe our inventory valuation reserve is adequate to properly value potential excess and obsolete inventory as of December 31, 2017, however, any significant changes to the factors mentioned above could lead our estimate to 49 change. Refer to Note 6 to our consolidated financial statements included in Part II, Item 8 of this Annual Report on Form 10-K for additional information related to inventory valuation adjustments recorded during 2017. Impairment of Long-Lived and Intangible Assets Long-lived assets, including vessels, property, plant and equipment, identifiable intangible assets being amortized and capitalized software costs are reviewed for impairment whenever events or changes in circumstances indicate the carrying amount of the long-lived asset may not be recoverable. The carrying amount of a long-lived asset is not recoverable if it exceeds the sum of the undiscounted cash flows expected to result from the use and eventual disposition of the asset. If it is determined that an impairment loss has occurred, the loss is measured as the amount by which the carrying amount of the long-lived asset exceeds its fair value. The determination of future cash flows as well as the estimated fair value of long-lived assets involves significant estimates on the part of management. Because there usually is a lack of quoted market prices for long-lived assets, fair value of impaired assets is typically determined based on the present values of expected future cash flows using discount rates believed to be consistent with those used by principal market participants, or based on a multiple of operating cash flow validated with historical market transactions of similar assets where possible. The expected future cash flows used for impairment reviews and related fair value calculations are based on judgmental assessments of future productivity of the asset, operating costs and capital decisions and all available information at the date of review. If future market conditions deteriorate beyond our current expectations and assumptions, impairments of long-lived assets may be identified if we conclude that the carrying amounts are no longer recoverable. Impairment of Goodwill Goodwill represents the excess of cost over the fair market value of net assets acquired in business combinations. Goodwill is not subject to amortization but is tested for impairment on an annual basis at a reporting level unit, or more frequently if impairment indicators arise. We have established October 31 as the date of our annual test for impairment of goodwill. We identify a potential impairment by comparing the fair value of the applicable reporting unit to its net book value, including goodwill. If the net book value exceeds the fair value of the reporting unit, we measure the impairment by comparing the carrying value of the reporting unit to its fair value. Reporting units with goodwill are tested for impairment using a quantitative impairment test. When using the quantitative impairment test, determining the fair value of a reporting unit is judgmental in nature and involves the use of significant estimates and assumptions. We estimate the fair value of our reporting units using a discounted future cash flow model. The majority of the estimates and assumptions used in a discounted future cash flow model involve unobservable inputs reflecting management own assumptions about the assumptions market participants would use in estimating the fair value of a business. These estimates and assumptions include revenue growth rates and operating margins used to calculate projected future cash flows, discount rates and future economic and market conditions. Our estimates are based upon assumptions believed to be reasonable, but which are inherently uncertain and unpredictable and do not reflect unanticipated events and circumstances that may occur. A lower fair value estimate in the future for any of our reporting units could result in goodwill impairments. Factors that could trigger a lower fair value estimate include sustained price declines of the reporting unit products and services, cost increases, regulatory or political environment changes, changes in customer demand, and other changes in market conditions, which may affect certain market participant assumptions used in the discounted future cash flow model based on internal forecasts of revenues and expenses over a specified period plus a terminal value (the income approach). The income approach estimates fair value by discounting each reporting unit estimated future cash flows using a weighted-average cost of capital that reflects current market conditions and the risk profile of the reporting unit. To arrive at our future cash flows, we use estimates of economic and market assumptions, including growth rates in revenues, costs, estimates of future expected changes in operating margins, tax rates and cash expenditures. Future revenues are also adjusted to match changes in our business strategy. We believe this approach is an appropriate valuation method. The risk-adjusted discount rate applied to our future cash flows under the income approach was 10.8% . The excess of fair value over carrying amount for our reporting units ranged from approximately 15% to in excess of 200% of the respective carrying amounts. Refer to Note 11 to our consolidated financial statements included in Part II, Item 8 of this Annual Report on Form 10-K for additional information related to goodwill impairment testing during 2017. Other Matters On March 28, 2016, FMC Technologies received an inquiry from the U.S. Department of Justice ("DOJ") related to the DOJ's investigation of whether certain services Unaoil S.A.M. provided to its clients, including FMC Technologies, violated the U.S. Foreign Corrupt Practices Act ("FCPA"). On March 29, 2016 Technip S.A. also received an inquiry from the DOJ related to Unaoil. We are cooperating with the DOJ's investigations and, with regard to FMC Technologies, a related investigation by the U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission. 50 In late 2016, Technip S.A. was contacted by the DOJ regarding its investigation of offshore platform projects awarded between 2003 and 2007, performed in Brazil by a joint venture company in which Technip S.A. was a minority participant, and we have also raised with DOJ certain other projects performed by Technip S.A. subsidiaries in Brazil between 2002 and 2013. The DOJ has also inquired about projects in Ghana and Equatorial Guinea that were awarded to Technip S.A. subsidiaries in 2008 and 2009, respectively. We are cooperating with the DOJ in its investigation into potential violations of the FCPA in connection with these projects and have also contacted the Brazilian authorities and are cooperating with their investigation concerning the projects in Brazil. Certain of the government investigations have identified issues relating to potential non-compliance with applicable laws and regulations, including the FCPA and Brazilian law, related to these historic matters. U.S. authorities have a broad range of civil and criminal sanctions under the FCPA and other laws and regulations, which they may seek to impose against corporations and individuals in appropriate circumstances including, but not limited to, fines, penalties and modifications to business practices and compliance programs. These authorities have entered into agreements with, and obtained a range of sanctions against, numerous public corporations and individuals arising from allegations of improper payments whereby civil and/or criminal penalties were imposed. Recent civil and criminal settlements have included fines of tens or hundreds of millions of dollars, deferred prosecution agreements, guilty pleas, and other sanctions, including the requirement that the relevant corporation retain a monitor to oversee its compliance with the FCPA. Brazilian authorities also have a range of sanctions available to them and have recently imposed substantial fines on corporations for anti-corruption violations. Any of these remedial measures, if applicable to us, as well as potential customer reaction to such remedial measures, could have a material adverse impact on our business, results of operations, and financial condition.
