In 2010, we changed our fiscal year end to September 30 from December 31. We made this change to better align our financial reporting period, as well as our annual planning and budgeting process, with our business cycle, particularly the cable broadcast year. This Annual Report on Form 10-K reports our financial results for the year ended September 30, 2011 (our first full fiscal year since the change), the nine-month transition period from January 1, 2010 through September 30, 2010 and the year ended December 31, 2009. For purposes of comparison, we have included the unaudited financial results for the year ended September 30, 2010 (which reflects our combined results for the quarter ended December 31, 2009 and the nine-month transition period from January 1, 2010 through September 30, 2010) and nine months ended September 30, 2009. See Note 19 to our Consolidated Financial Statements for additional information. We manage our operations through two reporting segments: Media Networks and Filmed Entertainment . Our measure of segment performance is adjusted operating income (loss). We define adjusted operating income (loss) for our segments as operating income (loss), less equity-based compensation and certain other items identified as affecting comparability, including restructuring charges and asset impairment, when applicable ( Factors Affecting Comparability ). Equity-based compensation is excluded from our segment measure of performance since it is set and approved by the Compensation Committee of Viacom Board of Directors in consultation with corporate executive management, and is included as a component of consolidated adjusted operating income. We use consolidated adjusted operating income, adjusted net earnings from continuing operations attributable to Viacom and adjusted diluted earnings per share ( EPS ) from continuing operations, as applicable, among other measures, to evaluate our actual operating performance and for planning and forecasting of future periods. We believe that the adjusted results provide relevant and useful information for investors because they clarify our actual operating performance, make it easier to compare Viacom results with those of other companies and allow investors to review performance in the same way as our management. Since these are not measures of performance calculated in accordance with generally accepted accounting principles ( GAAP ), they should not be considered in isolation of, or as a substitute for operating income, net earnings from continuing operations attributable to Viacom and diluted EPS as indicators of operating performance and they may not be comparable to similarly titled measures employed by other companies. For a reconciliation of our adjusted measures and discussion of the items affecting comparability refer to the section entitled Factors Affecting Comparability . Media Networks Our Media Networks segment, which includes brands such as MTV, VH1, CMT, Logo, Nickelodeon, Nick Jr., TeenNick, Nicktoons, Nick at Nite, Neopets, COMEDY CENTRAL, TV Land, Spike TV, Tr3s, BET, CENTRIC, AddictingGames and Shockwave, provides entertainment content and related branded products for consumers in targeted demographics attractive to advertisers, content distributors and retailers. We create, acquire and distribute programming and other content to our audiences across multiple platforms, which allows them to engage with our content how and where they want to view and interact with it: on television, online and on mobile devices and through a variety of consumer products. Our Media Networks segment generates revenues principally in three categories: (i) the sale of advertising time related to our content and associated marketing services, (ii) affiliate fees from cable television operators, 37 Table of Contents Management Discussion and Analysis of Results of Operations and Financial Condition (continued) direct-to-home satellite television operators, digital distributors and mobile networks and (iii) ancillary revenues, which include consumer products licensing, brand licensing, home entertainment sales of our programming, television syndication and casual gaming. Our advertising revenues may be affected by the strength of advertising markets and general economic conditions and may fluctuate depending on the success of our programming, as measured by viewership, at any given time. Advertising revenues may also fluctuate due to seasonal variations, typically being highest in the first quarter of our fiscal year. Our affiliate agreements with cable and satellite operators are generally multi-year carriage agreements with set rate increases that provide us with a reasonably stable source of revenues. The amount of the fees we receive is generally a function of the number of subscribers and the rates we receive per subscriber. Expirations of our affiliate agreements are staggered. Digital distribution agreements typically cover a large amount of programming and provide for various dates upon which each program becomes available for distribution on the digital platform. Revenue from these arrangements is recognized upon program availability and will fluctuate quarterly depending on the availability of the programs licensed. Digital distribution agreements are generally for a shorter term than carriage agreements with traditional cable and satellite operators. Our ancillary revenues vary based on consumer spending, the popularity of our programming, volume of content available for sale during a particular period and acceptance of our or our partners products. Media Networks segment expenses consist of operating expenses, selling, general and administrative ( SG&A ) expenses and depreciation and amortization. Operating expenses comprise costs related to original and acquired programming, including programming amortization, expenses associated with the manufacturing and distribution of home entertainment products and consumer products licensing, participation fees and other costs of sales. SG&A expenses consist primarily of employee compensation, marketing, research and professional service fees and facility and occupancy costs. Depreciation and amortization expenses reflect depreciation of fixed assets, including transponders financed under capital leases, and amortization of finite-lived intangible assets. In December 2010, we completed the sale of Harmonix Music Systems, Inc. ( Harmonix ), a developer of music-based games, including the Rock Band franchise. Accordingly, the results of operations of Harmonix, which were previously included in the Media Networks segment are presented as discontinued operations in all periods presented. Filmed Entertainment Our Filmed Entertainment segment produces, finances and distributes motion pictures and other entertainment content under the Paramount Pictures, Paramount Vantage, Paramount Classics, Insurge Pictures, MTV Films, and Nickelodeon Movies brands. Paramount also acquires films for distribution and has distribution relationships with third parties, including DreamWorks Animation SKG, Inc. ( DreamWorks Animation ). In fiscal year 2011, Paramount distributed the final two theatrical titles under its distribution arrangement with MVL Productions LLC ( Marvel ), now a subsidiary of The Walt Disney Company. In general, motion pictures produced, acquired and/or distributed by our Filmed Entertainment segment are exhibited theatrically domestically and internationally, followed by their release in various windows on DVD and Blu-ray, video-on-demand, subscription video-on-demand, pay and basic cable television, broadcast television and syndicated television, and, in some cases, by other exhibitors such as airlines and hotels (the distribution windows ). In fiscal year 2011, the Filmed Entertainment segment theatrically released in domestic and/or 38 Table of Contents Management Discussion and Analysis of Results of Operations and Financial Condition (continued) international markets Transformers: Dark of the Moon, Super 8, True Grit and Rango , among others. Paramount also distributed Marvel Thor and Captain America: The First Avenger and DreamWorks Animation Kung Fu Panda 2 and Megamind. Our Filmed Entertainment segment generates revenues worldwide principally from: (i) the theatrical release and/or distribution of motion pictures, (ii) home entertainment, which includes sales of DVD, Blu-ray and other products relating to the motion pictures we release theatrically and direct-to-DVD, as well as certain other programming, including content we distribute on behalf of third parties, (iii) television and digital license fees paid worldwide by third parties for film exhibition rights during the various other distribution windows and through digital distributors and (iv) ancillary revenues from providing production services to third parties, primarily at Paramount studio lot, licensing of its brands for consumer products and theme parks, distribution of content specifically developed for digital platforms and game distribution. Revenues from motion picture theatrical releases tend to be cyclical with increases during the summer months and around holidays, particularly in the first quarter of our fiscal year. The theatrical success of a motion picture is a significant factor in determining the revenues it is likely to generate in home entertainment sales and licensing fees during the various other distribution windows. Our home entertainment revenues may also be affected by the number, timing and mix of home entertainment releases in any given period, consumer tastes and consumption habits, the prominence given by distributors and retailers to our releases compared to those of our competitors, and by overall economic conditions, including consumer preference for rental or purchase and trends in discretionary spending. The industry continues to experience softness in the DVD market as a result of several factors, including the maturation of the standard definition DVD format, the emergence of various digital distribution platforms and weakness in the overall economy. We continue to focus on our inventory and supply chain management by carefully managing initial and replenishment shipments on home entertainment new releases, shelf space needs for catalog titles and other promotional and operating strategic initiatives. The output term of Paramount agreement with DreamWorks Animation expires on the later of the delivery of 13 qualified animated motion pictures and December 31, 2012, subject to earlier termination under certain limited circumstances. Paramount has distributed 11 DreamWorks Animation films under the agreement and expects to distribute the last two films under the current agreement in fiscal year 2012. In October 2010, Paramount and Marvel amended the arrangement under which Paramount distributes certain of Marvel self-produced feature films on a worldwide basis. Paramount transferred to Marvel substantially all of its worldwide distribution rights to The Avengers and all of its worldwide distribution rights to Iron Man 3 , in exchange for aggregate minimum guaranteed payments to Paramount of $115 million and the right for Paramount to receive certain contingent consideration. Paramount retained its distribution rights to Thor and Captain America: The First Avenger, which were released in fiscal year 2011, and to the previously released Iron Man and Iron Man 2 . Filmed Entertainment segment expenses consist of operating expenses, SG&A expenses and depreciation and amortization. Operating expenses principally include the amortization of film costs of our released feature films (including participations accrued under our third-party distribution arrangements), print and advertising expenses and other distribution costs. We incur marketing costs before and throughout the theatrical release of a film and, to a lesser extent, other distribution windows. Such costs are incurred to generate public interest in our films and are expensed as incurred; therefore, we typically incur losses with respect to a particular film prior to and during the film theatrical exhibition and profitability may not be realized until well after a film theatrical release. 39 Table of Contents Management Discussion and Analysis of Results of Operations and Financial Condition (continued) Therefore, the results of the Filmed Entertainment segment can be volatile as films work their way through the various distribution windows. SG&A expenses include employee compensation, facility and occupancy costs, professional service fees and other overhead costs. Depreciation and amortization expense includes depreciation of fixed assets and amortization of finite-lived intangible assets. RESULTS OF OPERATIONS Year ended September 30, 2011 vs. 2010 Consolidated Results of Operations Our summary consolidated results of operations are presented below for the years ended September 30, 2011 and 2010. As previously noted, the year ended September 30, 2010 reflects our unaudited combined results for the quarter ended December 31, 2009 and the nine-month transition period from January 1, 2010 through September 30, 2010. Year Ended September 30, Better/(Worse) (in millions, except per share amounts) 2011 2010 $ % Revenues $ 14,914 $ 13,356 $ 1,558 12 % Operating income 3,710 3,348 362 11 Adjusted operating income 3,854 3,408 446 13 Net earnings from continuing operations attributable to Viacom 2,146 1,899 247 13 Adjusted net earnings from continuing operations attributable to Viacom 2,247 1,841 406 22 Diluted EPS from continuing operations 3.61 3.11 0.50 16 Adjusted diluted EPS from continuing operations $ 3.78 $ 3.02 $ 0.76 25 % See the section entitled Factors Affecting Comparability for a reconciliation of our adjusted measures to our reported results. Revenues Worldwide revenues increased $1.558 billion, or 12%, to $14.914 billion in the year ended September 30, 2011. Media Networks contributed $814 million of the increase reflecting higher advertising and affiliate revenues. Filmed Entertainment contributed $770 million of the increase, principally reflecting higher theatrical and ancillary revenues, partially offset by lower home entertainment revenues. Operating Income Adjusted operating income increased $446 million, or 13%, to $3.854 billion in the year ended September 30, 2011. Media Networks adjusted operating income increased $467 million, principally reflecting the increased revenues, partially offset by increased expenses. Filmed Entertainment was substantially flat. Adjusted results for the year ended September 30, 2011 exclude the impact of $144 million of restructuring charges, principally related to workforce reductions, while the adjusted results for the year ended September 30, 2010 exclude the impact of a $60 million asset impairment. Including the impact of the current year restructuring charges and prior year asset impairment, operating income increased $362 million, or 11%, in the year ended September 30, 2011. See the section entitled Segment Results of Operations for a more in-depth discussion of the revenues, expenses and adjusted operating income for each of the Media Networks and Filmed Entertainment segments. Net Earnings from Continuing Operations Attributable to Viacom Adjusted net earnings from continuing operations attributable to Viacom increased $406 million, or 22%, in the year ended September 30, 2011, principally due to the increase in tax-effected adjusted operating income 40 Table of Contents Management Discussion and Analysis of Results of Operations and Financial Condition (continued) described above and higher equity income principally due to EPIX generating equity income this year as compared with losses in the prior year. Our effective income tax rate was 34.3% in the year ended September 30, 2011, as compared with 35.9% in the year ended September 30, 2010, excluding the impact of discrete items. The reduction in this year effective rate is principally due to a change in mix of domestic and international income. Adjusted diluted EPS from continuing operations increased $0.76 per diluted share to $3.78. Including the impact of the current year restructuring charges, loss on extinguishment of debt and discrete tax benefits, and prior year asset impairment and discrete tax benefits, net earnings from continuing operations attributable to Viacom increased $247 million, or 13%, in the year ended September 30, 2011. Diluted EPS from continuing operations increased $0.50 per diluted share to $3.61. See the section entitled Factors Affecting Comparability for a reconciliation of our adjusted measures to our reported results. Discontinued Operations, Net of Tax The loss from discontinued operations in both years was principally related to Harmonix. The $10 million loss in 2011 principally reflects the loss on the disposal of Harmonix and the Harmonix operating loss for the period through the date of sale, partially offset by the related tax benefit. The $351 million loss in 2010 principally reflects a $230 million impairment loss on Harmonix goodwill and other charges of approximately $30 million, principally related to unamortized development costs and other assets associated with legacy versions of the Rock Band game. Segment Results of Operations Transactions between reportable segments are accounted for as third-party arrangements for the purposes of presenting segment results of operations. Typical intersegment transactions include the purchase of advertising by the Filmed Entertainment segment on Media Networks properties and the purchase of Filmed Entertainment feature films exhibition rights by Media Networks .

Domestic revenues were $1.598 billion in the nine months ended September 30, 2010, a decline of $328 million, or 17%. International revenues were substantially flat at $1.764 billion in the nine months ended September 30, 2010, with a 3-percentage point favorable impact from foreign exchange on international revenues. Theatrical Worldwide theatrical revenues increased $55 million, or 4%, to $1.283 billion in the nine months ended September 30, 2010, principally driven by the strength of our 2010 releases. During the nine months ended September 30, 2010, we released nine films, including Shrek Forever After , Iron Man 2 , How to Train Your Dragon, The Last Airbender and Shutter Island, as compared to thirteen films in 2009. Domestic theatrical revenues decreased 11% reflecting the particularly strong domestic performance of Transformers: Revenge of the Fallen and Star Trek in 2009, while international theatrical revenues increased 23%. Foreign exchange had a 5-percentage point favorable impact on international theatrical revenues. Home Entertainment Worldwide home entertainment revenues decreased $405 million, or 30%, to $951 million in the nine months ended September 30, 2010. The decrease principally reflects fewer releases as compared with 2009. During the nine months ended September 30, 2010, we released five titles, including Iron Man 2 and Shutter Island , as compared to twelve titles in the nine months ended September 30, 2009. Also contributing to the decline were lower catalog sales and lower revenues from other third-party distribution arrangements. Domestic and international home entertainment revenues decreased 32% and 28%, respectively, with a 3-percentage point favorable impact from foreign exchange on international home entertainment revenues. Television License Fees Worldwide television license fees were flat at $938 million in the nine months ended September 30, 2010, with an increase in syndication revenues offset by a decrease in pay and network TV revenues reflecting the number and mix of available titles in each window. Ancillary Ancillary revenues increased $21 million, or 12%, to $190 million for the nine months ended September 30, 2010, principally due to higher digital revenues. Expenses Filmed Entertainment segment expenses decreased $423 million, or 11%, to $3.324 billion in the nine months ended September 30, 2010. The reduction in total expenses is principally due to fewer theatrical and home entertainment releases. Operating Operating expenses decreased $458 million, or 14%, to $2.888 billion in the nine months ended September 30, 2010. Distribution and other costs, principally print and advertising expenses, decreased by $333 million, or 20%, primarily related to the fewer number of theatrical and home entertainment releases as well as cost savings initiatives. Film costs declined $125 million, or 7%, primarily reflecting lower amortization of film costs due to the number and mix of current releases. Selling, General and Administrative SG&A increased $41 million, or 13%, to $367 million in the nine months ended September 30, 2010, principally driven by the timing of incentive compensation costs and severance costs associated with headcount reductions. 47 Table of Contents Management Discussion and Analysis of Results of Operations and Financial Condition (continued) Adjusted Operating Income Adjusted operating income was $38 million in the nine months ended September 30, 2010 compared with an adjusted operating loss of $56 million in the comparable period of 2009, principally reflecting the improved profitability of our 2010 releases. Year ended December 31, 2009 vs. 2008 Consolidated Results of Operations Our summary consolidated results of operations are presented below for the years ended December 31, 2009 and 2008. Year Ended December 31, Better/(Worse) (in millions, except per share amounts) 2009 2008 $ % Revenues $ 13,257 $ 13,947 $ (690 ) (5 )% Operating income 3,045 2,562 483 19 Adjusted operating income 3,138 3,016 122 4 Net earnings from continuing operations attributable to Viacom 1,678 1,257 421 33 Adjusted net earnings from continuing operations attributable to Viacom 1,646 1,515 131 9 Diluted EPS from continuing operations 2.76 2.01 0.75 37 Adjusted diluted EPS from continuing operations $ 2.71 $ 2.42 $ 0.29 12 % See the section entitled Factors Affecting Comparability for a reconciliation of our adjusted measures to our reported results. Revenues Worldwide revenues for the year ended December 31, 2009 decreased $690 million, or 5%, to $13.257 billion. Filmed Entertainment contributed $551 million of the decrease primarily driven by declines in theatrical and home entertainment revenues, partially offset by an increase in television and ancillary revenues. The decrease in feature film revenues reflects fewer films released in 2009 as compared to 2008 and the decrease in home entertainment revenues principally results from the number and mix of titles released in 2009 compared to 2008. Media Networks contributed $152 million of the decrease reflecting declines in advertising and ancillary revenues, partially offset by an increase in affiliate fees. Operating Income Adjusted operating income increased $122 million, or 4%, to $3.138 billion in 2009 driven by a $144 million increase at Filmed Entertainment, partially offset by an $8 million decrease at Media Networks . The increase at Filmed Entertainment principally reflects the success of certain 2009 releases, including Transformers: Revenge of the Fallen, Star Trek and Paranormal Activity , partially offset by fewer distributed films. The decrease at Media Networks principally reflects lower advertising revenues, partially offset by an increase in affiliate revenues. Both segments benefited from lower costs in 2009 as a result of restructurings and other cost savings initiatives. Operating income increased $483 million, or 19%, to $3.045 billion in 2009 reflecting lower restructuring and other charges as discussed in Factors Affecting Comparability . See the section entitled Segment Results of Operations for a more in depth discussion of the revenues, expenses and operating income for each of the Media Networks and Filmed Entertainment segments. Net Earnings from Continuing Operations Attributable to Viacom Adjusted net earnings from continuing operations attributable to Viacom increased $131 million, or 9%, in 2009 reflecting the increase in tax-effected adjusted operating income, a decrease in Interest expense, net due to lower 48 Table of Contents Management Discussion and Analysis of Results of Operations and Financial Condition (continued) average debt outstanding, and lower foreign exchange losses and costs associated with our receivables securitization programs, both of which are included in Other items, net. Adjusted diluted EPS from continuing operations increased $0.29 per diluted share from $2.42 in 2008 to $2.71 in 2009. Adjusted results exclude the impact of certain items identified as affecting comparability, including a loss on extinguishment of debt in 2009, investment impairments in 2008, and restructuring and other charges and discrete tax benefits in both periods. See the section entitled Factors Affecting Comparability for a reconciliation of our adjusted measures to our reported results. Net earnings from continuing operations attributable to Viacom increased $421 million, or 33%, in 2009. Diluted EPS from continuing operations increased $0.75 per diluted share from $2.01 in 2008 to $2.76 in 2009. Discontinued Operations, Net of Tax The loss from discontinued operations, net of tax was $67 million and $6 million in the year ended December 31, 2009 and 2008, respectively, principally reflecting losses related to Harmonix.

Declines in advertising and ancillary revenues were partially offset by an increase in affiliate fees. Domestic revenues decreased to $6.705 billion, a decline of $14 million. International revenues decreased to $1.221 billion, a decline of $138 million, or 10%, including a 5-percentage point negative impact from foreign exchange. Advertising Worldwide advertising revenues decreased $317 million, or 7%, to $4.405 billion in 2009. Domestic advertising revenue decreased 6%, while international advertising revenues decreased 14%, with foreign exchange negatively impacting international growth by 5 percentage points. In 2009, global economic conditions had a negative impact on the advertising market and our revenues, although the advertising market strengthened in the second half of 2009. 49 Table of Contents Management Discussion and Analysis of Results of Operations and Financial Condition (continued) Affiliate Fees Worldwide affiliate fees increased $281 million, or 11%, to $2.901 billion in 2009. Domestic affiliate fees increased 12% and international affiliate fees increased 3%, principally due to rate and subscriber growth. International affiliate revenues include 8 percentage points of negative impact from foreign exchange. Ancillary Worldwide ancillary revenues decreased $116 million, or 16%, to $620 million in 2009. The decrease is primarily driven by lower home entertainment and consumer products revenues. Domestic and international ancillary revenues declined 12% and 22%, respectively. International ancillary revenues also included a 2-percentage point negative impact from foreign exchange. Expenses Media Networks segment expenses decreased $144 million, or 3%, to $4.737 billion in 2009. The reduction in total expenses includes lower employee compensation and other cost benefits principally resulting from the actions taken in connection with restructurings and other initiatives. These decreases were partially offset by costs related to our continued investment in programming. Operating Operating expenses increased $19 million, or 1%, to $2.689 billion in 2009. Programming costs increased $60 million, or 3%, primarily reflecting an increase in costs of $139 million, or 6%, due to our continued investment in programming, partially offset by $79 million of savings attributable to programming abandonments taken in connection with our 2008 restructuring. Distribution and other expenses decreased $41 million, or 11%. Selling, General and Administrative SG&A decreased $142 million, or 7%, to $1.844 billion in 2009, principally due to lower employee compensation costs and other cost savings initiatives, principally resulting from the 2008 restructuring action described in the Factors Affecting Comparability section. Depreciation and Amortization Depreciation and amortization decreased $21 million, or 9%, to $204 million in 2009, due to lower capital lease depreciation expense and lower overall capital spending. Adjusted Operating Income Adjusted operating income decreased $8 million to $3.189 billion in 2009. The decrease principally reflects lower advertising and ancillary revenues, partially offset by higher affiliate revenues and the cost savings from restructurings. 50 Table of Contents Management Discussion and Analysis of Results of Operations and Financial Condition (continued) Filmed Entertainment Year Ended December 31, Better/(Worse) (in millions) 2009 2008 $ % Revenues by Component Theatrical $ 1,321 $ 1,714 $ (393 ) (23 )% Home entertainment 2,501 2,724 (223 ) (8 ) Television license fees 1,383 1,333 50 4 Ancillary 277 262 15 6 Total revenues by component $ 5,482 $ 6,033 $ (551 ) (9 )% Expenses Operating $ 4,652 $ 5,344 $ 692 13 % Selling, general & administrative 479 479 - - Depreciation & amortization 105 108 3 3 Total expenses $ 5,236 $ 5,931 $ 695 12 % Adjusted Operating Income $ 246 $ 102 $ 144 NM NM - Not Meaningful Revenues Worldwide revenues decreased $551 million, or 9%, to $5.482 billion in 2009. Declines in theatrical and home entertainment revenues were partially offset by an increase in television and ancillary revenues. Domestic revenues decreased to $2.942 billion, a decline of $300 million, or 9%. International revenues decreased to $2.54 billion, a decline of $251 million, or 9%, including a 5-percentage point negative impact from foreign exchange. Theatrical Worldwide theatrical revenues decreased $393 million, or 23%, to $1.321 billion in 2009, principally driven by a smaller slate of films. During 2009, we released twenty films, including Transformers: Revenge of the Fallen , Star Trek , G.I. Joe: The Rise of Cobra, Paranormal Activity and DreamWorks Animation Monsters vs. Aliens compared to twenty-four films released in 2008, which included Indiana Jones and the Kingdom of the Crystal Skull , Marvel Iron Man and DreamWorks Animation Kung Fu Panda and Madagascar 2: Escape to Africa. Domestic theatrical revenues decreased 8%, and international theatrical revenues decreased 36%. Foreign exchange had a 9-percentage point negative impact on international theatrical revenues. Home Entertainment Worldwide home entertainment revenues decreased $223 million, or 8%, to $2.501 billion in 2009. Decreased revenues principally reflect the number and mix of titles released in 2009 versus 2008. Domestic and international home entertainment revenues decreased 12% and 3%, respectively, with a 3-percentage point negative impact from foreign exchange on international revenues. The DVD market continued to be negatively affected by global economic conditions throughout most of 2009, with strengthening seen in the fourth quarter of the calendar year relative to our major release titles. Television License Fees Worldwide television license fees increased $50 million, or 4%, to $1.383 billion in 2009, principally reflecting higher Pay TV fees driven by the number and mix of available titles. Ancillary Ancillary revenues increased $15 million, or 6%, to $277 million in 2009 due to higher digital and merchandising revenues. 51 Table of Contents Management Discussion and Analysis of Results of Operations and Financial Condition (continued) Expenses Filmed Entertainment segment expenses decreased $695 million, or 12%, to $5.236 billion in 2009. The reduction in total expenses principally reflects our reduced film slate and lower costs associated with third party distribution agreements. Operating Operating expenses decreased $692 million, or 13%, to $4.652 billion in 2009. Distribution and other expenses decreased $487 million, or 19%, primarily related to the reduced number of theatrical releases, lower home entertainment expenses and cost savings initiatives. Film costs decreased $205 million, or 7%. The decrease was primarily due to lower participation costs associated with third party distribution arrangements, partially offset by higher amortization of certain film costs. Selling, General and Administrative SG&A was substantially flat at $479 million in 2009. The benefits from our cost savings initiatives contributed to containing SG&A costs. Depreciation and Amortization Depreciation and amortization decreased $3 million, or 3%, to $105 million in 2009. Adjusted Operating Income Adjusted operating income increased $144 million to $246 million in 2009. The increase principally reflects the success of certain 2009 releases, including Transformers: Revenge of the Fallen, Star Trek and Paranormal Activity and cost savings from restructurings and other initiatives, partially offset by fewer distributed films. FACTORS AFFECTING COMPARABILITY The consolidated financial statements as of and for the years ended September 30, 2011 and 2010, the nine months ended September 30, 2010 and 2009 and the years ended December 31, 2009 and 2008 reflect our results of operations, financial position and cash flows reported in accordance with U.S. GAAP. Results for the aforementioned periods, as discussed in the section entitled Overview , have been affected by certain items identified as affecting comparability. The following tables reconcile our adjusted measures to our reported results for the years ended September 30, 2011 and 2010, the nine months ended September 30, 2010 and 2009, and the years ended December 31, 2009 and 2008.

Restructuring Restructuring charges are reflected within Restructuring in the Consolidated Statement of Earnings. 2011 In the quarter ended September 30, 2011, we reviewed our cost structure and took certain actions to combine and increase the efficiency of various functions across the organization, resulting in a restructuring charge of $130 million. The restructuring plan includes workforce reductions and other exit activities across the Company operations, which are well under way. As a result of these initiatives we expect annual savings of approximately $140 million, the benefit of which will phase in through fiscal year 2013. We expect that the restructuring plan will be substantially completed by September 30, 2012 and involve cash payments of approximately $120 million, a majority of which is expected to be paid in fiscal 2012. In the quarter ended June 30, 2011, the Media Networks segment incurred employee separation costs, including accelerated vesting of certain equity-based compensation awards, of $14 million. The following table presents the components of the 2011 restructuring charges by segment: 2011 Restructuring Charges (in millions) Media Networks Filmed Entertainment Total Severance charges $ 84 $ 39 $ 123 Lease termination and other exit costs 7 14 21 September 30, 2011 $ 91 $ 53 $ 144 2009 In 2009, we took actions resulting in severance charges of $16 million in the Media Networks segment and $17 million in the Filmed Entertainment segment. 2008 In 2008, to better align our organization and cost structure with changing economic conditions, we undertook a strategic review of our businesses which resulted in $454 million of charges. In addition to broad adverse 54 Table of Contents Management Discussion and Analysis of Results of Operations and Financial Condition (continued) economic conditions, the strategic review considered the emergence of sustained softness in the advertising market and ratings issues at certain channels in the Media Networks segment, and the Filmed Entertainment segment decision to reduce its future film slate. As a result of these initiatives we saved approximately $200 million in the year ended December 31, 2009. Approximately half of the savings from the restructuring charges were principally comprised of workforce reductions and were realized via lower compensation costs primarily included as a component of Selling, general and administrative expenses in our Consolidated Statement of Earnings. The following table presents the components of the 2008 restructuring and other charges by segment: 2008 Restructuring and Other Charges (in millions) Media Networks Filmed Entertainment Corporate Total Severance and lease termination costs $ 71 $ 29 $ 3 $ 103 Programming and film inventory 286 19 - 305 Asset impairments and other 32 14 - 46 December 31, 2008 $ 389 $ 62 $ 3 $ 454 See Note 11 to our Consolidated Financial Statements for additional information regarding these actions. Extinguishment of Debt 2011 In 2011, we conducted a cash tender offer to repurchase a portion of the $1.5 billion aggregate principal of our 6.25% Senior Notes due 2016. Our repurchase of $582 million of principal at a purchase price of $1,153.50 per $1,000 pursuant to the tender offer resulted in a pre-tax extinguishment loss of $87 million. 2009 In 2009, we conducted a cash tender offer to repurchase a substantial portion of the $1.5 billion aggregate principal of our 5.75% Senior Notes due 2011. Our repurchase of $1.307 billion of principal at a purchase price of $1,061.25 per $1,000 pursuant to the tender offer resulted in a pre-tax extinguishment loss of $84 million. Asset Impairment 2009 In 2009, we recorded a $60 million non-cash impairment charge in the Media Networks segment related to certain broadcast licenses held by a 32%-owned consolidated entity. The impact to Net earnings attributable to Viacom was a reduction of $19 million, with the remaining $41 million allocated to the noncontrolling interest. 2008 In 2008, we recognized non-cash investment impairment charges of $27 million. Discrete Tax Items Our effective income tax rate was 34.3% and 35.9% for the year ended September 30, 2011 and 2010, respectively, excluding the impact of discrete items. In 2011, discrete tax benefits of $52 million, taken together with the impact of restructuring charges and the 2011 loss on extinguishment of debt, contributed 1.6 percentage points of net tax benefit, which reconciles to the reported rate of 32.7%. In 2010, discrete tax benefits of $77 million, taken together with the impact of asset impairment, contributed 2.0 percentage points of tax benefit, which reconciles to the reported effective tax rate of 33.9%. The discrete tax benefits in both periods were principally due to reserve releases resulting from effectively settled audits. The benefit in 2010 also reflects the disposition of certain assets. 55 Table of Contents Management Discussion and Analysis of Results of Operations and Financial Condition (continued) Our effective income tax rate was 36.1% for the nine months ended September 30, 2010 and 2009, excluding the impact of discrete items. In 2010, discrete tax benefits of $27 million contributed 1.5 percentage points of tax benefit, which reconciles to the reported rate of 34.6%. In 2009, discrete tax benefits of $74 million contributed 5.4 percentage points of tax benefit, which reconciles to the reported rate of 30.7%. The benefit in the nine months ended September 30, 2010 principally reflects tax benefits from the disposition of certain assets. The benefit in the nine months ended September 30, 2009 principally reflects reserve releases resulting from effectively settled audits and the recognition of certain previously unrecognized capital losses from international operations. Our effective income tax rate was 35.9% and 35.5% in the year ended December 31, 2009 and 2008, respectively, excluding the impact of discrete items. In 2009, discrete tax benefits of $124 million, taken together with the impact of restructuring charges, asset impairment and the 2009 loss on extinguishment of debt, contributed 4.4 percentage points of tax benefit, which reconciles to the reported rate of 31.5%. In 2008, discrete tax benefits of $55 million, taken together with the impact of restructuring and other charges, contributed 2.8 percentage points of tax benefit, which reconciles to the reported rate 32.7%. The discrete taxes in each period were principally due to reserve releases resulting from effectively settled audits. The benefit in 2009 also reflects the recognition of certain previously unrecognized capital losses from international operations. LIQUIDITY AND CAPITAL RESOURCES Liquidity Sources and Uses of Cash Our primary source of liquidity is cash provided through the operations of our businesses. Our principal uses of cash in operations include the creation of new programming and film content, acquisitions of third-party content, and interest and tax payments. We also use cash for capital expenditures, acquisitions of businesses, quarterly cash dividends and discretionary share repurchases under our stock repurchase program, as deemed appropriate. Our cash flows from operations, together with our $2.0 billion revolving credit facility, provide us with adequate resources to fund our anticipated ongoing cash requirements. We have and may continue to access external financing from time to time depending on our cash requirements, assessments of current and anticipated market conditions and after-tax cost of capital. Our access to capital markets can be impacted by factors outside our control, including economic conditions; however, we believe that our strong cash flows and balance sheet, our credit facility and our credit rating will provide us with adequate access to funding given our expected cash needs. Any new borrowing cost would be affected by market conditions and short and long-term debt ratings assigned by independent rating agencies. Cash Flows Cash and cash equivalents increased by $184 million in the year ended September 30, 2011 and $539 million in the nine months ended September 30, 2010, and decreased $494 million in the year ended December 31, 2009. The net change in cash and cash equivalents was attributable to the following: Cash Flows (in millions) Year Ended September 30, Nine Months Ended September 30, Year Ended December 31, 2011 2010 2010 2009 2009 2008 Cash provided by operations $ 2,644 $ 1,566 $ 1,147 $ 732 $ 1,151 $ 2,036 Net cash flow used in investing activities (227) (325) (168) (117) (274) (571) Net cash flow used in financing activities (2,227) (655) (436) (1,169) (1,388) (1,555) Effect of exchange rates on cash and cash equivalents (6) 2 (4) 11 17 (38) Net change in cash and cash equivalents $ 184 $ 588 $ 539 $ (543) $ (494) $ (128) 56 Table of Contents Management Discussion and Analysis of Results of Operations and Financial Condition (continued) Operating Activities Cash provided by operations was $2.644 billion for the year ended September 30, 2011, an increase of $1.078 billion compared with the same period in 2010. The increase principally reflects the comparison against a $775 million reduction in securitized receivables in 2010 and higher income, partially offset by increased production spending at the Filmed Entertainment segment, as well as the payment of the premium on our 2011 debt extinguishment. In addition, cash used in discontinued operations was $21 million in fiscal 2011 as compared with cash provided by discontinued operations of $121 million in the prior year, principally due to a full year of activity in the prior year as compared with three months in the current year. The Media Networks segment consistently generates a significant percentage of our cash flow from operating activities. Advertising time is generally purchased by large media buying agencies and our affiliate fees are principally earned from cable and satellite television operators. The Filmed Entertainment segment operational results and ability to generate cash flow from operations substantially depend on the number and timing of films in development and production, the level and timing of print and advertising costs and the public response to our theatrical film and home entertainment releases. Our cash flow from operations tends to fluctuate seasonally as a result of timing of cash payments and collections, typically being highest in the first quarter of our fiscal year. Cash provided by operations was $1.147 billion for the nine months ended September 30, 2010, an increase of $415 million compared with the nine months ended September 30, 2009. The increase principally reflects the increase in earnings, lower pension contributions, lower print and advertising expenses and the comparison against a $175 million reduction in securitized receivables and an $84 million payment of a premium on debt extinguishment in 2009, partially offset by higher income tax payments. Cash tax payments increased during the period primarily as a result of prior year tax benefits associated with our 2008 restructuring and other charges, the expiration at December 31, 2009 of certain Federal income tax benefits related to programming and film investment and increased pre-tax earnings. Cash provided by operations was $1.151 billion for the year ended December 31, 2009, a decrease of $885 million compared with 2008. The decrease was primarily due to a $950 million reduction in securitized receivables, increased pension contributions, severance payments and payment of a premium on our 2009 debt extinguishment, partially offset by lower payments for production spending, income taxes and interest. Investing Activities Cash used in investing activities was $227 million for the year ended September 30, 2011, compared with $325 million in the same period in 2010. The decrease is principally due to lower spending on acquisitions and investments. In fiscal year 2011, cash used in investing activities included $72 million related to acquisitions and investments principally reflecting an investment in a European television programmer. In the prior year, the $154 million related to acquisitions and investments principally related to the acquisition of Teenage Mutant Ninja Turtles and investment in EPIX. In general, our segments require relatively low levels of capital expenditures in relation to our annual cash flow from operations which contributes to our ability to generate cash flow for future investment in our content and business operations, which we expect to be able to maintain over time. Cash used in investing activities was $168 million for the nine months ended September 30, 2010, compared with $117 million in the nine months ended September 30, 2009. The increase is primarily due to increased spending on capital expenditures and investments, principally related to Viacom 18 and EPIX, partially offset by cash acquired from DW Funding. 57 Table of Contents Management Discussion and Analysis of Results of Operations and Financial Condition (continued) Cash used in investing activities was $274 million for the year ended December 31, 2009, compared with $571 million in 2008. The decrease was primarily due to lower spending on acquisitions and investments in 2009, as well as lower spending on capital expenditures. In 2009, cash used in investing activities included $133 million related to acquisitions and investments and $139 million in capital expenditures. In 2008, cash used in investing activities included $283 million of capital expenditures, principally related to improvements to certain new and existing facilities (including approximately $100 million related to New York real estate facilities), $146 million related to acquisitions and investments and a $150 million earn-out payment related to our 2006 acquisition of Harmonix, which is reflected in discontinued operations. Financing Activities Cash used in financing activities was $2.227 billion for the year ended September 30, 2011, compared with $655 million in the same period in 2010. The net outflow was primarily driven by share repurchases and dividends. During the year ended September 30, 2011, we repurchased 55.7 million shares for an aggregate price of $2.5 billion, of which $2.45 billion of repurchases had settled as of September 30, 2011, and paid $417 million in dividends. Our commercial paper borrowings of $423 million, taken together with the net impact of our issuance of $1.0 billion of senior notes, repurchase of $582 million principal amount of our 6.25% Senior Notes due 2016 and repayment of the remaining $193 million principal amount of our 5.75% Senior Notes due on April 30, 2011, contributed a partially offsetting inflow. In the prior year, cash used in financing activities was driven by the repayment of long-term debt and commercial paper borrowings. Cash used in financing activities was $436 million for the nine months ended September 30, 2010, compared with $1.169 billion for the nine months ended September 30, 2009. The net outflow in 2010 was primarily driven by the repayment of DW Funding debt and the dividends paid. The net outflow in 2009 was primarily driven by $750 million in payments related to the maturity of our floating rate senior notes which came due in the second quarter of 2009 and a decrease in amounts outstanding under our revolving credit facility. In 2009, we issued a total of $1.4 billion of senior notes and used the proceeds to repurchase $1.307 billion outstanding principal of our 5.75% Senior Notes due 2011. Cash used in financing activities was $1.388 billion for the year ended December 31, 2009. The net outflow was primarily driven by the maturity of our $750 million floating rate senior notes and the decrease in amounts outstanding under our revolving credit facility. We did not repurchase any shares under our stock repurchase program during 2009. Cash used in financing activities was $1.555 billion for the year ended December 31, 2008. The net outflow was principally driven by $1.266 billion of share repurchases under our stock repurchase program and net payments of $280 million on the outstanding balances related to our credit facility, commercial paper and other debt obligations. 58 Table of Contents Management Discussion and Analysis of Results of Operations and Financial Condition (continued) Capital Resources Capital Structure and Debt At September 30, 2011, total debt was $7.365 billion, an increase of $613 million from $6.752 billion at September 30, 2010. The increase in debt reflects the impact of new issuances and commercial paper borrowings, partially offset by repayments. Debt (in millions) September 30, 2011 2010 Senior notes and debentures $ 6,536 $ 6,320 Commercial paper 423 - Capital leases and other obligations 406 432 Total debt $ 7,365 $ 6,752 Senior Notes and Debentures During the year, we took advantage of favorable market conditions to lengthen the maturities and reduce the weighted-average borrowing cost of our public debt. We issued a total of $1.0 billion of senior notes with maturities of six and ten years. In February, we issued $500 million aggregate principal amount of 4.5% Senior Notes due 2021 at a price equal to 98.320% of the principal amount. We used the net proceeds from this offering of $488 million to conduct a cash tender offer to repurchase a portion of the $1.5 billion aggregate principal of our 6.25% Senior Notes due 2016 at a weighted-average purchase price of $1,153.50 per $1,000 of principal. Our repurchase of $582 million of principal pursuant to the tender offer resulted in a pre-tax extinguishment loss of $87 million. In March, we issued $500 million aggregate principal amount of 3.5% Senior Notes due 2017 at a price equal to 99.139% of the principal amount. We used the net proceeds from this offering for general corporate purposes, including the repayment of the remaining $193 million principal amount of our 5.75% Senior Notes due on April 30, 2011 and the repurchase of shares under our stock repurchase program. Our outstanding senior notes and debentures provide for certain covenant packages typical for an investment grade company. There is one acceleration trigger for certain of the senior notes and debentures in the event of a change in control under certain specified circumstances coupled with ratings downgrades due to the change in control. At September 30, 2011 and 2010, the total unamortized net discount related to the fixed rate senior notes and debentures was $32 million and $23 million, respectively. We anticipate that future debt maturities will be funded with cash and cash equivalents, cash flows from operating activities and future access to capital markets, including our revolving credit facility. There can be no assurance that we will be able to access capital markets on terms and conditions that will be acceptable to us. Credit Facility On October 8, 2010, we terminated our $3.25 billion revolving facility due December 2010 and entered into a $2.0 billion revolving credit facility, which matures in October 2013. There were no amounts outstanding under our credit facility at September 30, 2011 and 2010. The primary purpose of the facility is to fund short-term liquidity needs and to support commercial paper borrowings. Borrowing rates under the facility are determined at the time of each borrowing and are based generally on LIBOR plus a margin ranging from 0.75% to 2.0% based on our public debt rating. A facility fee is paid based on the total amount of the commitments. The facility contains typical covenants for an investment grade company and one financial covenant that requires our interest coverage, calculated as operating income before depreciation and amortization divided by interest expense (defined by the credit agreement), for the most recent four consecutive fiscal quarters, to be at least 3.0x, which we met at September 30, 2011. 59 Table of Contents Management Discussion and Analysis of Results of Operations and Financial Condition (continued) Commercial Paper At September 30, 2011, the outstanding commercial paper of $423 million had a weighted average interest rate of 0.41% and a weighted average maturity of less than 30 days. There were no amounts outstanding as of September 30, 2010. Current Portion of Debt Amounts classified in the current portion of debt consist of the portion of capital leases payable in the next twelve months. Securitization Facilities In April 2010, we terminated our accounts receivable securitization programs because we had access to sufficient sources of liquidity at better terms. Film Financing Arrangements Historically we have entered into film financing arrangements that involve the sale of a partial copyright interest in a film to third-party investors. Since the investors typically have the risks and rewards of ownership proportionate to their ownership in the film, we generally record the amounts received for the sale of copyright interest as a reduction of the cost of the film and related cash flows are reflected in net cash flow from operating activities. We also have agreements with third parties, including other studios, to co-finance certain of our motion pictures. Stock Repurchase Program On June 9, 2010, our Board of Directors authorized an increase in the funds available to purchase Class B common stock under the Company stock repurchase program to $4.0 billion from the existing remaining capacity of $1.275 billion. During the year ended September 30, 2011, we repurchased 55.7 million shares under the program for an aggregate price of $2.5 billion. From October 1, 2011 through November 9, 2011, we repurchased an additional 6.5 million shares for an aggregate price of $276 million. On November 9, 2011, our Board of Directors authorized an increase in the funds available under the program to $10.0 billion, leaving $7.2 billion of remaining capacity. There were no repurchases during the nine months ended September 30, 2010 and year ended December 31, 2009. Commitments and Contingencies Our commitments primarily consist of programming and talent commitments, operating and capital lease arrangements, and purchase obligations for goods and services. These arrangements result from our normal course of business and represent obligations that may be payable over several years. Additionally, we are subject to a redeemable put option, payable in a foreign currency, with respect to an international subsidiary, which is classified as Redeemable noncontrolling interest in the Consolidated Balance Sheets. The put option expires in January 2016. See Note 16 to our Consolidated Financial Statements for additional information related to the redeemable noncontrolling interest. In the course of our business, the Company both provides and receives the benefit of indemnities that are intended to allocate certain risks associated with business transactions. Similarly, we may remain contingently liable for various obligations of a business that has been divested in the event that a third party does not live up to its obligations under an indemnification agreement. Further, we may from time to time agree to pay additional consideration to the sellers of a business depending on the performance of the business during a period following the closing. 60 Table of Contents Management Discussion and Analysis of Results of Operations and Financial Condition (continued) Guarantees Leases We have certain indemnification obligations with respect to leases associated with the previously discontinued operations of Famous Players and Blockbuster. In addition, we have certain indemnities provided by the acquirer of Famous Players. At September 30, 2011, these lease commitments, substantially all of which relate to Famous Players, amounted to approximately $600 million. The amount of lease commitments varies over time depending on expiration or termination of individual underlying leases, or of the related indemnification obligation, and foreign exchange rates, among other things. We may also have exposure for certain other expenses related to the leases, such as property taxes and common area maintenance. We have recorded a liability of approximately $200 million with respect to such obligations. Based on our consideration of financial information available to us, the lessees historical performance in meeting their lease obligations and the underlying economic factors impacting the lessees business models, we believe our accrual is sufficient to meet any future obligations. Other We have indemnification obligations with respect to letters of credit and surety bonds primarily used as security against non-performance in the normal course of business. The outstanding letters of credit and surety bonds at September 30, 2011 were $60 million and are not recorded on the balance sheet. The Company and its venture partner each have a commitment to guarantee up to $55 million of bank debt of Viacom 18. There were no borrowings outstanding at September 30, 2011 subject to this guarantee. We also have a remaining funding commitment of $15 million as of September 30, 2011. Legal Matters Litigation is inherently uncertain and always difficult to predict. However, based on our understanding and evaluation of the relevant facts and circumstances, we believe that the legal matters described below and other litigation to which we are a party are not likely, in the aggregate, to have a material adverse effect on our results of continuing operations, financial position or operating cash flows. In March 2007, we filed a complaint in the United States District Court for the Southern District of New York against Google Inc. ( Google ) and its wholly-owned subsidiary YouTube, alleging that Google and YouTube violated and continue to violate the Company copyrights. We are seeking both damages and injunctive relief. In March 2010, we and Google filed motions for summary judgment, and in June 2010, Google motion was granted. The District Court decision has been appealed to the U.S. Court of Appeals for the Second Circuit and oral argument was heard in October 2011. We believe we have a meritorious appeal. In September 2007, Brantley, et al. v. NBC Universal, Inc., et al., was filed in the United States District Court for the Central District of California against us and several other program content providers on behalf of a purported nationwide class of cable and satellite subscribers. The plaintiffs also sued several major cable and satellite program distributors. Plaintiffs allege that separate contracts between the program providers and the cable and satellite operator defendants providing for the sale of programming in specific tiers each unreasonably restrain trade in a variety of markets in violation of the Sherman Act. In June 2011, the Court of Appeals for the Ninth Circuit affirmed the District Court decision dismissing, with prejudice, the plaintiff third amended complaint. The plaintiffs filed a petition for a rehearing of the case by the full Court of Appeals and oral argument was heard in October 2011. On October 31, 2011, the Court of Appeals withdrew its decision in light of the subsequent death of one of the judges on the panel. Another judge of the court will replace the deceased judge. In light of this development, the motion for a rehearing before the entire court was dismissed as moot. We believe the plaintiffs position in this litigation is without merit and intend to continue to vigorously defend this lawsuit. 61 Table of Contents Management Discussion and Analysis of Results of Operations and Financial Condition (continued) Our 2006 acquisition agreement with Harmonix Music Systems, Inc. ( Harmonix ), a developer of music-based games, including the Rock Band franchise, provided that to the extent financial results exceeded specific contractual targets against a defined gross profit metric for the calendar years 2007 and 2008, former Harmonix shareholders would be eligible for incremental earn-out payments. In 2008, we paid $150 million, subject to adjustment, under this earn-out agreement related to 2007 performance. The final amount of the earn-out related to 2007 and 2008 performance has not yet been determined and a private dispute resolution process before an accounting expert is expected to conclude in the first quarter of fiscal year 2012. Our position in the dispute resolution process is that approximately $130 million of the earlier $150 million payment was not earned and that no payment is owed with respect to 2008 performance. The shareholder representative has claimed that we owe an additional $700 million with respect to 2007 and 2008 performance. We strongly disagree with the position of the shareholder representative and have filed a lawsuit in the Court of Chancery for the State of Delaware against certain of the former Harmonix shareholders seeking a refund of a substantial portion of the $150 million payment. Accordingly, we have not recorded a reserve as of September 30, 2011. In December 2010, the shareholder representative filed a lawsuit in the Court of Chancery for the State of Delaware seeking the release of approximately $13 million, which is being held in escrow to secure the shareholder representative indemnification obligations to us under the acquisition agreement and damages in respect of certain other claims. In May 2011, we filed a motion to dismiss the portion of the shareholder representative amended complaint that relates to the other claims and a decision is pending. We believe the shareholder representative position in this proceeding is without merit and are vigorously defending this lawsuit. Contractual Obligations Our contractual obligations include amounts reflected on our balance sheet, as well as off-balance sheet arrangements. At September 30, 2011, our significant contractual obligations, including payments due for the next five fiscal years and thereafter, were as follows: Contractual Obligations (in millions) Total Less than 1 year 1-3 years 3-5 years After 5 years Off-balance Sheet Arrangements Programming and talent commitments (1) $ 1,228 $ 439 $ 483 $ 234 $ 72 Operating leases (2) 975 199 337 197 242 Purchase obligations (3) 835 430 288 98 19 On-Balance Sheet Arrangements Capital lease obligations (4) 220 32 53 51 84 Debt 7,219 566 685 1,168 4,800 Interest payments 6,788 384 768 681 4,955 Other long-term obligations (5) $ 2,954 $ 1,669 $ 913 $ 347 $ 25 (1) Programming and talent commitments include $1.011 billion relating to media networks programming and $217 million for talent contracts. (2) Includes long-term non-cancelable operating lease commitments for office space, equipment, transponders, studio facilities and vehicles. (3) Purchase obligations include agreements to purchase goods or services that are enforceable and legally binding and that specify all significant terms, including open purchase orders. (4) Includes capital leases for satellite transponders. (5) Other long-term obligations principally consist of participations, residuals and programming obligations for content that is available for airing. Note: Not included in the amounts above are payments which may result from our defined benefit pension plans of $441 million, unrecognized tax benefits of $274 million, including interest and penalties, $15 million of funding commitments to joint ventures, interest payments to be made under our credit facility, $152 million of redeemable noncontrolling interest and lease guarantees of approximately $600 million. The amount and timing of payments with respect to these items are subject to a number of uncertainties such that we are unable to make sufficiently reliable estimations of future payments. We do expect to make contributions of approximately $45 million in fiscal 2012 to our pension plans. 62 Table of Contents Management Discussion and Analysis of Results of Operations and Financial Condition (continued) MARKET RISK We are exposed to market risk related to foreign currency exchange rates and interest rates. We use or expect to use derivative financial instruments to modify exposure to risks from fluctuations in foreign currency exchange rates and interest rates. In accordance with our policy, we do not use derivative instruments unless there is an underlying exposure, and we do not hold or enter into financial instruments for speculative trading purposes. Foreign Exchange Risk We conduct business in various countries outside the United States, resulting in exposure to movements in foreign exchange rates when translating from the foreign local currency to the U.S. Dollar. In order to economically hedge anticipated cash flows and foreign currency balances in such currencies as the British Pound, the Australian Dollar, the Euro, the Japanese Yen, and the Canadian Dollar, foreign currency forward contracts are used. The change in fair value of non-designated contracts is included in current period earnings as part of Other items, net . Additionally, from time to time we enter into forward contracts to hedge future production costs or programming obligations or hedge the foreign currency exposure of a net investment in a foreign operation. We manage the use of foreign exchange derivatives centrally. The notional value of all foreign exchange contracts was $89 million and $150 million at September 30, 2011 and 2010, respectively. In 2011, $5 million related to net investments in foreign operations, $7 million related to expected foreign currency net cash flows and $77 million related to programming obligations. In 2010, $94 million related to net investments in foreign operations, $13 million related to expected foreign currency net cash flows and $43 million related to programming obligations. Interest Rate Risk A portion of our interest expense is exposed to movements in short-term rates. Also, interest expense for future long-term debt issues is exposed to movements in long-term rates. Interest rate hedges may be used to modify both of these exposures. At September 30, 2011, the notional value of all interest rate hedges was $500 million. There were no interest rate hedges outstanding at September 30, 2010. Since the majority of our debt is fixed rate, we do not expect that a 1% increase or decrease in the level of interest rates would have a material impact on our Consolidated Financial Statements. Viacom has issued senior notes and debentures that, at September 30, 2011, had an outstanding balance of $6.5 billion and an estimated fair value of $7.3 billion. A 1% increase or decrease in the level of interest rates, respectively, would decrease or increase the fair value of the senior notes and debentures by approximately $570 million and $670 million. Credit Risk We continually monitor our positions with, and credit quality of, our customers and the financial institutions which are counterparties to our financial instrument agreements. We are exposed to credit loss in the event of nonpayment by our customers and nonperformance by the counterparties to our financial instrument agreements. However, we do not anticipate nonperformance by the counterparties to our financial instrument agreements and we believe our allowance for doubtful accounts is sufficient to cover any anticipated nonpayment by our customers. 63 Table of Contents Management Discussion and Analysis of Results of Operations and Financial Condition (continued) CRITICAL ACCOUNTING POLICIES AND ESTIMATES The preparation of our financial statements in conformity with accounting principles generally accepted in the United States requires management to make estimates, judgments and assumptions that affect the amounts reported in the consolidated financial statements and accompanying notes. On an ongoing basis, we evaluate our estimates, which are based on historical experience and on various other assumptions that we believe are reasonable under the circumstances. The result of these evaluations forms the basis for making judgments about the carrying values of assets and liabilities and the reported amount of expenses that are not readily apparent from other sources. Actual results may differ from these estimates under different assumptions. An appreciation of our critical accounting policies, those that are considered by management to require significant judgment and use of estimates and that could have a significant impact on our financial statements, is necessary to understand our financial results. Unless otherwise noted, we applied our critical accounting policies and estimation methods consistently in all material respects and for all periods presented, and have discussed such policies with our Audit Committee. Film Accounting Revenue Recognition Revenue we earn in connection with the exhibition of feature films by our Filmed Entertainment segment is recognized in accordance with the accounting guidance for producers or distributors of films. Our Filmed Entertainment segment principally earns revenue from the exhibition of feature film content based upon theatrical exhibition, home entertainment and various television markets (e.g., network, pay, syndication, basic cable). We recognize revenue from theatrical distribution of motion pictures upon exhibition. We recognize revenue from home entertainment product sales, net of anticipated returns, including rebates and other incentives, upon the later of delivery or the date that these products are made widely available for sale by retailers. We recognize revenue from the licensing of feature films and original programming for exhibition in television markets upon availability for airing by the licensee. We recognize revenue for video-on-demand and similar pay-per-view arrangements as the feature films are exhibited based on end-customer purchases as reported by the distributor. Original Production and Film Costs We capitalize original production, including original programming and feature film costs, on a title-specific basis, as Inventory, net in the Consolidated Balance Sheets. We use an individual-forecast-computation method to amortize the costs over the applicable title life cycle based upon the ratio of current period to estimated remaining total gross revenues ( ultimate revenues ) for each title. We expense advertising costs as they are incurred and expense manufacturing costs, such as DVD manufacturing costs, on a unit-specific basis when we recognize the related revenue. Our estimate of ultimate revenues for feature films includes revenues from all sources that are estimated to be earned within ten years from the date of a film initial theatrical release. For acquired film libraries, our estimate of ultimate revenues is for a period within 20 years from the date of acquisition. Prior to the release of a feature film and throughout its life, we estimate the ultimate revenues based on the historical performance of similar content, as well as incorporating factors of the content itself, including, but not limited to, the expected number of theaters and markets in which the original content will be released, the genre of the original content and the past box office performance of the lead actors and actresses. We believe the most sensitive factor affecting our estimate of ultimate revenues for films intended for theatrical release is domestic theatrical exhibition, as subsequent markets have historically exhibited a high correlation to domestic theatrical performance. Upon a film release and determination of domestic theatrical performance, our estimates of revenues from succeeding windows and markets are revised based on historical relationships and an analysis of current market trends. The 64 Table of Contents Management Discussion and Analysis of Results of Operations and Financial Condition (continued) most sensitive factor affecting our estimates for films subsequent to their initial release is the extent of home entertainment sales achieved. In addition to theatrical performance, home entertainment sales vary based on a variety of factors including demand for our titles, the volume and quality of competing home entertainment products, marketing and promotional strategies, as well as economic conditions. For original programming, capitalized program costs are amortized over the projected useful life of the programming, depending on genre and historical experience, beginning with the month of initial exhibition. The most sensitive factor affecting ultimate revenues is the program rating. Program ratings, which are an indication of audience acceptance, directly impact the level of advertising revenues we will be able to generate during the airing of the programming. Poor ratings may result in abandonment of a program, which would require the immediate write-off of any unamortized production costs. The estimate of ultimate revenues impacts the timing of original production cost amortization. Upon a film initial release we update our estimate of ultimate revenues based on expected future and actual results. We also review and revise estimates of ultimate revenue and participation costs as of each reporting date to reflect the most current available information. If estimates for a film are revised, the difference between amortization expense determined using the new estimate and any amounts previously expensed during that fiscal year are charged or credited to our Consolidated Statements of Earnings in the quarter in which the estimates are revised. If we believe that the release of our content will not be or has not been favorably received, then we would assess whether the fair value of such content is less than the unamortized portion of its capitalized costs and, if need be, recognize an impairment charge for the amount by which the unamortized capitalized costs exceed the fair value. We utilize the individual-film-forecast-computation method (adjusted to incorporate revenue and related costs, including future exploitation costs, if any, expected to occur in periods beyond 10 years from the date of the film initial release) to develop the cash flows which are subsequently discounted to compute the fair value of a film at each reporting period. The discount rate utilized takes into account the time value of money as well as a risk premium. The risk premium reflects the uncertainties of realizing the expected cash flows of a film title which is impacted by a film title position within its product life cycle. Acquired Programming Rights We report an asset and liability for the rights acquired and obligations incurred at the commencement of the licensing period when the cost of the programming is known or reasonably determinable, the program material has been accepted and the programming is available for airing. We record the transaction using the gross liability provision. The asset is amortized to operating expenses over the license period or projected useful life of the programming, if shorter, commencing upon availability. Determining factors used in estimating the useful life of programming includes the expected number of future airings, which may differ from the contracted number of airings, the length of the license period and expected future revenues to be generated from the programming. The cost basis of acquired programming is the capitalized cost of each program and is equal to the cost of the programming pursuant to the license agreement less the cumulative amortization recorded for the program. Capitalized costs of rights to program materials are reported in our Consolidated Balance Sheets at the lower of unamortized cost or estimated net realizable value. We evaluate net realizable value of acquired rights programming quarterly on a daypart basis. A daypart is defined as an aggregation of programs broadcast during a particular time of day or an aggregation of programs of a similar type. We aggregate similar programming based on the specific demographic targeted by each respective program service. Net realizable value is determined by estimating advertising revenues to be derived from the future airing of the programming within the daypart as well as an allocation of affiliate fee revenue to programming. An impairment charge may be necessary if our estimates of future cash flows of similar programming are insufficient or if programming is abandoned. 65 Table of Contents Management Discussion and Analysis of Results of Operations and Financial Condition (continued) Revenue Recognition Gross versus Net Revenue Recognition We earn and recognize revenues where we act as distributor on behalf of third parties. In such cases, determining whether revenue should be reported on a gross or net basis is based on management assessment of whether we act as the principal or agent in the transaction. To the extent we act as the principal in a transaction, we report revenues on a gross basis. Determining whether we act as principal or agent in a transaction involves judgment and is based on an evaluation of whether we have the substantial risks and rewards of ownership under the terms of an arrangement. Our most significant distribution arrangements are in connection with certain exclusive distribution rights to and home video fulfillment services for the animated feature films produced by DreamWorks Animation, the distribution agreement with CBS and our continuing distribution relationship with Marvel for the films we theatrically distributed. Under the terms of these agreements, we generally are responsible for all out-of-pocket costs, primarily comprised of distribution and marketing costs. For the provision of distribution services, we generally retain a fee based upon a percentage of gross receipts and recover expended distribution and marketing costs on a title-by-title basis prior to any participation payments to the contracting parties of the films, except as pertains to certain contractually agreed upon advance payments, if applicable. As primary obligor, revenue and related distribution and marketing costs for these arrangements are presented on a gross basis. Sales Returns, Allowances and Uncollectible Accounts In accordance with the accounting guidance related to revenue recognition when a right of return exists, revenue allowances are recorded to adjust amounts originally invoiced to the estimated net realizable value of a particular product. Upon the sale of home entertainment products to wholesalers and retailers, we record a reduction of revenue for the impact of estimated future returns, rebates and other incentives ( estimated returns ). In determining estimated returns, we consider numerous sources of qualitative and quantitative evidence including forecasted sales data, customers rights of return, units shipped and units remaining at retail, historical return rates for similar product, current economic trends, competitive environment, promotions and sales strategies. Forecasted sales data is determined by comparing a particular release to product that has similar characteristics where applicable, such as franchise, genre, box office levels and release patterns, using regression analysis, decay rates and other tools. Based on the results of this analysis and the sales strategies to be used for the release, we reserve an appropriate percentage of each dollar of product revenue on a title taking into consideration the qualitative and quantitative factors described above. Forecasted sales data is reviewed and updated throughout each quarter, and, with respect to home entertainment product, is consistent with the projections of ultimate revenues used in applying the individual-forecast-computation method to amortize our film costs. Accordingly, a change in forecasted sales affects both the revenue allowance and related expenses. Actual sell-through data is reviewed as it becomes available against the forecasted sales data to ensure that estimates continue to be consistent with actual sales performance. Our estimate of future returns affects reported revenue and operating income. If we underestimate the impact of future returns in a particular period, then we may record less revenue and related expenses in later periods when returns exceed the estimated amounts. If we overestimate the impact of future returns in a particular period, then we may record additional revenue and related expenses in later periods when returns are less than estimated. An incremental change of 1% in our estimated sales returns rate (i.e., provisions for returns divided by gross sales of related product) for home entertainment products would have a $27 million impact on our total revenue for the year ended September 30, 2011. This revenue impact would be partially offset by a corresponding impact on related expenses depending on the margin associated with a specific film and other factors. In computing our sales returns rate, sales include home entertainment revenues of our Filmed Entertainment and Media Networks segments. Home entertainment revenues of our Media Networks segment are included within Media Networks ancillary revenues. 66 Table of Contents Management Discussion and Analysis of Results of Operations and Financial Condition (continued) We also continually evaluate accounts receivable and establish judgments as to their ultimate collectability. Judgments and estimates involved include an analysis of specific risks on a customer-by-customer basis for larger accounts and an analysis of actual historical write-off experience in conjunction with the length of time the receivables are past due. Using this information, management reserves an amount that is estimated to be uncollectible. An incremental change of 1% in our allowance for uncollectible accounts relative to our trade accounts receivables would have a $21 million impact on our operating results for the year ended September 30, 2011. Provision for Income Taxes As a global entertainment content company, we are subject to income taxes in the United States and foreign jurisdictions where we have operations. Significant judgment is required in determining our annual provision for income taxes and evaluating our income tax positions. Our tax rates are affected by many factors, including our global mix of earnings, legislation, acquisitions and dispositions, as well as the tax characteristics of our income. In determining our income tax provisions on a jurisdiction basis, we are required to make judgments on the need to record deferred tax assets and liabilities, including the realizability of deferred tax assets. A valuation allowance for deferred tax assets is established if it is more likely than not that a deferred tax asset will not be realized. In evaluating uncertain tax positions, we make determinations of the application of complex tax rules, regulations and practices. We evaluate our uncertain tax positions quarterly based on many factors including, but not limited to, new facts, changes in tax law and information received from regulators. A change in any one of these factors could change our evaluation of an existing uncertain tax position, resulting in the recognition of an additional charge or benefit to our income tax provision in the period. As such, going forward, our effective tax rate may fluctuate. Additionally, our income tax returns are routinely audited and settlements of issues raised in these audits sometimes affect our tax provisions. The resolution of audit issues and income tax positions taken may take extended periods of time due to the length of examinations by tax authorities and the possible extension of statutes of limitations. A 1% change in our effective rate, excluding discrete items, would result in additional income tax expense of approximately $32 million for the year ended September 30, 2011. We permanently reinvest the earnings of substantially all of our foreign subsidiaries outside the United States. We do not provide for U.S. taxes on earnings of our foreign subsidiaries for which the earnings are permanently reinvested. Fair Value Measurements The performance of fair value measurements is an integral part of the preparation of financial statements in accordance with GAAP. Fair value is defined as the price that would be received to sell the asset or paid to transfer the liability in an orderly transaction between market participants. Selection of the appropriate valuation technique, as well as determination of assumptions, risks and estimates used by market participants in pricing the asset or liability requires significant judgment. Although we believe that the inputs used in our valuation techniques are reasonable, a change in one or more of the inputs could result in an increase or decrease in the fair value of certain assets and certain liabilities. Either instance would have an impact on both our Consolidated Balance Sheet and Consolidated Statement of Earnings. Provided below are those instances where the determination of fair value could have the most significant impact on our financial condition or results of operations: Goodwill . Goodwill at September 30, 2011 relates to our reporting units Music and Logo ($2.0 billion), Nickelodeon ($2.9 billion), Entertainment ($1.8 billion), BET Networks ($2.7 billion) and Paramount ($1.6 billion). In September 2011, the Financial Accounting Standards Board issued new guidance that permits 67 Table of Contents Management Discussion and Analysis of Results of Operations and Financial Condition (continued) an entity to first assess qualitative factors to determine whether it is necessary to perform the two-step annual goodwill impairment test. If an entity believes, as a result of its qualitative assessment, that it is more-likely-than-not that the fair value of a reporting unit is greater than its carrying amount, the quantitative impairment test is not required. The guidance is effective for goodwill impairment tests performed for fiscal years beginning after December 15, 2011 with early adoption permitted. We adopted the new guidance for our August 31, 2011 annual goodwill impairment test. Based on our qualitative assessment, including but not limited to, consideration of macroeconomic conditions, industry and market conditions, cost factors, cash flows, changes in key Company personnel and our share price, we were not required to perform the two-step goodwill impairment test for any of our reporting units. Under the accounting rules in effect in 2010 and 2009, we were required to perform the annual quantitative impairment test. The first step of a quantitative goodwill impairment test is to identify a potential impairment by comparing the fair value of a reporting unit with its carrying amount. The second step, if necessary, compares the implied fair value of the reporting unit goodwill with the carrying amount of that goodwill. The implied fair value of goodwill is determined in the same manner as the amount of goodwill recognized in a business combination. The estimates of fair value of a reporting unit were determined based on a discounted cash flow analysis. A discounted cash flow analysis requires us to make various judgmental assumptions, including assumptions about the timing and amount of future cash flows, growth rates and discount rates. Given the inherent uncertainty in determining these assumptions, actual results may differ from those used in our valuations. The assumptions about future cash flows and growth rates were based on the budget and long-term business plans of each operating segment. Such assumptions took into account numerous factors including historical experience, anticipated economic conditions, advertising sales and ratings trends, terms of affiliate license arrangements and anticipated terms of renewals, projected costs for production and programming, number and expected financial performance of films expected to be produced and distributed each year and changes in the reporting unit cost structures. Discount rate assumptions for each reporting unit took into account our assessment of the risks inherent in the future cash flows of the respective reporting unit and our weighted-average cost of capital. We also reviewed marketplace data to assess the reasonableness of our computation of Viacom overall weighted average cost of capital and, when available, the discount rates utilized for each of our reporting units. Discontinued Operations In connection with our 2010 goodwill impairment test, we recorded a $230 million goodwill impairment charge related to Harmonix. The estimated fair value of Harmonix was determined using a discounted cash flow analysis. Significant assumptions reflected in the analysis include the estimated future cash flows of the business and discount rate. A one percentage point change in the perpetual growth rate or discount rate would not have resulted in a significant change in the goodwill impairment charge. Finite-Lived Intangible Assets. In determining whether finite-lived intangible assets (e.g., customer lists, film libraries) are impaired, the accounting rules do not provide for an annual impairment test. Instead, they require that a triggering event occur before testing an asset for impairment. Once a triggering event has occurred, the impairment test employed is based on whether the intent is to hold the asset for continued use or to hold the asset for sale. If the intent is to hold the asset for continued use, first a comparison of undiscounted future cash flows against the carrying value of the asset is performed. If the carrying value exceeds the undiscounted cash flows, the asset would be written down to the discounted fair value. If the intent is to hold the asset for sale, to the extent the carrying value is greater than the asset value, an impairment loss is recognized for the difference. 68 Table of Contents Management Discussion and Analysis of Results of Operations and Financial Condition (continued) Significant judgments in this area involve determining whether a triggering event has occurred, the determination of the cash flows for the assets involved and the discount rate to be applied in determining fair value. OTHER MATTERS Related Parties National Amusements Inc. ( NAI ), directly and through a wholly-owned subsidiary, is the controlling stockholder of both Viacom and CBS Corporation ( CBS ). Sumner M. Redstone, the controlling shareholder, Chairman and Chief Executive Officer of NAI, serves as our Executive Chairman and Founder and as the Executive Chairman and Founder of CBS. Shari Redstone, who is Sumner Redstone daughter, is the President and a director of NAI, and serves as non-executive Vice Chair of the Board of Directors of both Viacom and CBS. George Abrams, one of our directors, serves on the boards of both NAI and Viacom, and Frederic Salerno, another of our directors, serves on the boards of both Viacom and CBS. Philippe Dauman, our President and Chief Executive Officer, also serves on the boards of both NAI and Viacom. Transactions between Viacom and related parties are overseen by our Governance and Nominating Committee. Viacom and NAI Related Party Transactions NAI licenses films in the ordinary course of business for its motion picture theaters from all major studios, including Paramount. Paramount earned revenues from NAI in connection with these licenses in the aggregate amounts of approximately $44 million in 2011, $21 million in 2010 and $34 million in 2009. Viacom and CBS Corporation Related Party Transactions In the ordinary course of business, we are involved in transactions with CBS and its various businesses that result in the recognition of revenues and expenses by Viacom. Transactions with CBS are settled in cash. Paramount earns revenues and recognizes expenses associated with the distribution of certain television products into the home entertainment market on behalf of CBS. Under the terms of the agreement, Paramount is entitled to retain a fee based on a percentage of gross receipts and is generally responsible for all out-of-pocket costs which are recoupable together with any advance amounts paid, prior to any participation payments to CBS. In connection with this agreement, Paramount made payments of $50 million in the quarter ended March 31, 2011, and $100 million in each of the quarters ended March 31, 2010 and 2009. Paramount also earns revenues from CBS through leasing of studio space and licensing of certain film products. Additionally, the Media Networks segment recognizes advertising revenues from CBS. The Media Networks segment purchases television programming from CBS. The cost of such purchases is initially recorded as acquired program rights inventory and amortized over the estimated period that revenues will be generated. Both of our segments recognize advertising expenses related to the placement of advertisements with CBS. 69 Table of Contents Management Discussion and Analysis of Results of Operations and Financial Condition (continued) The following table summarizes the transactions with CBS as included in our consolidated financial statements. CBS Related Party Transactions (in millions) Year Ended September 30, 2011 Nine Months Ended September 30, 2010 Year Ended December 31, 2009 Consolidated Statements of Earnings Revenues $ 341 $ 244 $ 406 Operating expenses $ 434 $ 318 $ 504 September 30, 2011 2010 Consolidated Balance Sheets Accounts receivable $ 6 $ 9 Other assets 1 1 Total due from CBS $ 7 $ 10 Accounts payable $ 1 $ 4 Participants share and residuals, current 162 227 Program rights obligations, current 73 100 Program rights obligations, noncurrent 243 263 Other liabilities 37 39 Total due to CBS $ 516 $ 633 Agreements with CBS Corporation In connection with the separation, we and CBS entered into a Separation Agreement, a Transition Services Agreement and a Tax Matters Agreement, as well as certain other agreements to govern the terms of the separation and certain of the ongoing relationships between CBS and us after the separation. These related party arrangements are more fully described below. Indemnification Obligations. Pursuant to the Separation Agreement, each company indemnified the other company and the other company officers, directors and employees for any losses arising out of its failure to perform or discharge any of the liabilities it assumed pursuant to the Separation Agreement, including with respect to certain legal matters, its businesses as conducted as of the date of the separation and its breaches of shared contracts. Limitations on Certain Acquisitions. Subject to limited exceptions, the Separation Agreement provides that none of Viacom, any subsidiary of Viacom or any person that is controlled by Viacom after the separation will own or acquire an interest in a radio or television broadcast station, television broadcast network or daily newspaper, if such ownership or acquisition would (i) cause CBS, any subsidiary of CBS or any entity controlled by CBS after the date of the separation to be in violation of U.S. federal laws limiting the ownership or control of radio broadcast stations, television broadcast stations and/or television broadcast networks or (ii) limit in any manner at any time under such laws CBS ability to acquire additional interests in a radio or television broadcast station and/or television broadcast network. These restrictions will terminate when none of Mr. Redstone, NAI, NAIRI or any of their successors, assigns or transferees are deemed to have interests in both CBS and Viacom that are attributable under applicable U.S. federal laws. The Separation Agreement also provides that neither Viacom, any subsidiary of Viacom or any person controlled by Viacom nor CBS, any subsidiary of CBS or any person controlled by CBS will acquire any asset, enter into any agreement or accept or agree to any condition that purports to bind, or subjects to a legal order, the other company, its subsidiaries or any person it controls without such other party written consent. 70 Table of Contents Management Discussion and Analysis of Results of Operations and Financial Condition (continued) Tax Matters The Tax Matters Agreement sets forth Viacom responsibilities with respect to, among other things, liabilities for federal, state, local and foreign income taxes for periods before and including the merger, the preparation and filing of income tax returns for such periods, disputes with taxing authorities regarding income taxes for such periods and indemnification for income taxes that would become due if the merger were taxable. Viacom is generally responsible for federal, state and local, and foreign income taxes for periods before the merger relating to Viacom respective businesses. Income tax liabilities relating to discontinued operations and previously disposed businesses have been allocated in accordance with the principles applicable under the Separation Agreement for liabilities relating to those operations and businesses. Other income tax liabilities, including items that do not specifically relate to either business, will be shared equally. Viacom and CBS will generally be jointly responsible for managing any dispute relating to income taxes for which both parties may be responsible. The Tax Matters Agreement also provides that, depending on the event, Viacom may have to indemnify CBS, or CBS may have to indemnify Viacom, for some or all of the taxes resulting from the transactions related to the merger and the distribution of Viacom common stock if the merger and distribution do not qualify as tax-free under Sections 355 and 368 of the Code. Other Related Party Transactions In the ordinary course of business, we are involved in related party transactions with equity investees, principally related to investments in unconsolidated variable interest entities as more fully described in Note 3 to our Consolidated Financial Statements. These related party transactions principally relate to the provision of advertising services, licensing of film and programming content, distribution of films and provision of certain administrative support services, for which the impact on our Consolidated Financial Statements is as follows: Other Related Party Transactions (in millions) Year Ended September 30, 2011 Nine Months Ended September 30, 2010 Year Ended December 31, 2009 Consolidated Statements of Earnings Revenues $ 239 $ 168 $ 375 Operating expenses $ 83 $ 53 $ 207 Selling, general and administrative $ (16 ) $ (24 ) $ - September 30, 2011 2010 Consolidated Balance Sheets Accounts receivable $ 88 $ 88 Other assets 2 9 Total due from other related parties $ 90 $ 97 Accounts payable $ 32 $ 26 Other liabilities 10 29 Total due to other related parties $ 42 $ 55 All other related party transactions are not material in the periods presented. 71 Table of Contents
