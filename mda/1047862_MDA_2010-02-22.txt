(b) Represents inter-company and parent company accounting. See Results of Operations, below. Con Edison net income for common stock in 2009 was $868 million or $3.16 a share ($3.14 on a diluted basis). Net income for common stock in 2008 and 2007 was $1,196 million or $4.38 a share ($4.37 on a diluted basis) and $929 million or $3.49 a share ($3.47 on a diluted basis), respectively. See Results of Operations Summary, below. For segment financial information, see Note N to the financial statements in Item 8 and Results of Operations, below. Results of Operations Summary Net income for the years ended December 31, 2009, 2008 and 2007 was as follows: (Millions of Dollars) 2009 2008 2007 CECONY $ 781 $ 783 $ 844 O&R 43 44 46 Competitive energy businesses(a) 59 73 58 Other(b) (15 ) 22 (23 ) Total continuing operations 868 922 925 Discontinued operations(c) 274 4 Con Edison $ 868 $ 1,196 $ 929 (a) Includes $19 million, $(59) million and $(5) million of net after-tax mark-to-market gains/(losses) in 2009, 2008 and 2007, respectively. In 2008, also includes $131 million after-tax from the gain on sale of Con Edison Development ownership interests in electricity generating plants. See Note U to the financial statements in Item 8. (b) Consists of inter-company and parent company accounting. In 2008, also includes $30 million of after-tax net income related to the resolution of Con Edison legal proceeding with Northeast Utilities. See Results of Operations, below. (c) Represents the discontinued operations of certain of Con Edison Development ownership interests in electricity generating plants. See Note U to the financial statements in Item 8. 45 Table of Contents The Companies results of operations for 2009, as compared with 2008, reflect changes in the Utilities rate plans (including additional revenues designed to recover increases in certain operations and maintenance expenses, depreciation and property taxes, interest charges and the impact of revenue decoupling mechanisms), a regulatory reserve in December 2009 relating to the NYSPSC review of capital spent during the period April 2005 through March 2008, and the operating results of the competitive energy businesses (including net mark-to-market effects). The results of operations for 2009 as compared with 2008 include a higher allowed return for the second, third and fourth quarters of 2009, offset in part by a lower allowed electric return on common equity for CECONY for the first quarter of 2009. Operations and maintenance expenses were higher in 2009 compared with 2008 reflecting primarily higher costs, which are generally reflected in rates, such as pension and other postretirement benefits and uncollectible accounts that were offset in part by austerity initiatives reflecting the general economic downturn. Depreciation and property taxes were higher in 2009 compared with 2008 reflecting primarily the impact from increased capital expenditures and higher property tax rates. Results of operations for 2008 include the gain on the sale of ownership interests in electricity generating plants, the impact of discontinued operations and resolution of litigation with Northeast Utilities. The following table presents the estimated effect on earnings per share and net income for common stock for 2009 as compared with 2008 and 2008 as compared with 2007, resulting from these and other major factors: 2009 vs. 2008 2008 vs. 2007 Earnings per Share Net Income (Millions of Dollars) Earnings per Share Net Income (Millions of Dollars) CECONY Rate plans, primarily to recover increases in certain costs $ 1.28 $ 351 $ 0.63 $ 169 Resolution of deferred tax amortization petition in 2007 and other tax matters (0.08 ) (22 ) Operations and maintenance expense (0.62 ) (169 ) (0.44 ) (117 ) Long Island City power outage reserve in 2008 0.05 14 0.04 10 2005 2008 capital expenditure reserve (0.05 ) (14 ) Depreciation and property taxes (0.55 ) (151 ) (0.22 ) (59 ) Net interest expense (0.14 ) (38 ) (0.07 ) (19 ) Other (includes dilutive effect of new stock issuances) 5 (0.16 ) (23 ) Total CECONY (0.03 ) (2 ) (0.30 ) (61 ) Orange and Rockland Utilities (1 ) (0.01 ) (2 ) Competitive energy businesses Earnings excluding net mark-to-market effects, gain on the sale of ownership interests in electricity generating plants and discontinued operations 0.15 39 (0.24 ) (62 ) Net mark-to-market effects 0.29 78 (0.20 ) (54 ) Gain on the sale of ownership interests in electricity generating plants and discontinued operations (1.49 ) (405 ) 1.48 401 Total competitive energy businesses (1.05 ) (288 ) 1.04 285 Northeast Utilities litigation settlement (0.11 ) (30 ) 0.11 30 Other, including parent company expenses (0.03 ) (7 ) 0.05 15 Total variations $ (1.22 ) $ (328 ) $ 0.89 $ 267 See Results of Operations below for further discussion and analysis of results of operations. Risk Factors The Companies businesses are influenced by many factors that are difficult to predict, and that involve uncertainties that may materially affect actual operating results, cash flows and financial condition. See Risk Factors in Item 1A. 46 Table of Contents Application of Critical Accounting Policies The Companies financial statements reflect the application of their accounting policies, which conform to accounting principles generally accepted in the United States of America. The Companies critical accounting policies include industry-specific accounting applicable to regulated public utilities and accounting for pensions and other postretirement benefits, contingencies, long-lived assets, derivative instruments, goodwill and leases. Accounting for Regulated Public Utilities The Utilities are subject to the accounting rules for regulated operations and the accounting requirements of the FERC and state public utility regulatory authorities having jurisdiction. The accounting rules for regulated operations specify the economic effects that result from the causal relationship of costs and revenues in the rate-regulated environment and how these effects are to be accounted for by a regulated enterprise. Revenues intended to cover some costs may be recorded either before or after the costs are incurred. If regulation provides assurance that incurred costs will be recovered in the future, these costs would be recorded as deferred charges or regulatory assets under the accounting rules. If revenues are recorded for costs that are expected to be incurred in the future, these revenues would be recorded as deferred credits or regulatory liabilities under the accounting rules. The Utilities principal regulatory assets and liabilities are listed in Note B to the financial statements in Item 8. The Utilities are each receiving or being credited with a return on all regulatory assets for which a cash outflow has been made. The Utilities are each paying or being charged with a return on all regulatory liabilities for which a cash inflow has been received. The regulatory assets and liabilities will be recovered from customers, or applied for customer benefit, in accordance with rate provisions approved by the applicable public utility regulatory commission. In the event that regulatory assets of the Utilities were no longer probable of recovery (as required by the accounting rules), these regulatory assets would be charged to earnings. At December 31, 2009, the regulatory assets for Con Edison and CECONY were $7,304 million and $6,694 million, respectively. Accounting for Pensions and Other Postretirement Benefits The Utilities provide pensions and other postretirement benefits to substantially all of their employees and retirees. Con Edison competitive energy businesses also provide such benefits to certain of their employees. The Companies account for these benefits in accordance with the accounting rules for retirement benefits. In addition, the Utilities apply the accounting rules for regulated operations to account for the regulatory treatment of these obligations (which, as described in Note B to the financial statements in Item 8, reconciles the amounts reflected in rates for the costs of the benefit to the costs actually incurred). In applying these accounting policies, the Companies have made critical estimates related to actuarial assumptions, including assumptions of expected returns on plan assets, discount rates, health care cost trends and future compensation. See Notes A, E and F to the financial statements in Item 8 for information about the Companies pension and other postretirement benefits, the actuarial assumptions, actual performance, amortization of investment and other actuarial gains and losses and calculated plan costs for 2009, 2008 and 2007. The cost of pension and other postretirement benefits in future periods will depend on actual returns on plan assets, assumptions for future periods, contributions and benefit experience. Con Edison and CECONY current estimates for 2010 are increases, compared with 2009, in their pension and other postretirement benefits cost of $181 million and $178 million, respectively. The discount rates used to determine 2010 pension and other postretirement benefit accounting costs are 6.05 percent and 5.95 percent, respectively, and the expected return on plan assets (tax-exempt assets for postretirement benefit accounting costs) is 8.50 percent. 47 Table of Contents The discount rate for determining the present value of future period benefit payments is determined using a model to match the durations of highly-rated (Aa and Aaa, by Moody s) corporate bonds with the projected stream of benefit payments. In determining the health care cost trend rate, the Companies review actual recent cost trends and projected future trends. The following table illustrates the effect on 2010 pension and other postretirement costs of changing the critical actuarial assumptions discussed above, while holding all other actuarial assumptions constant: (Millions of Dollars) Actuarial Assumption Change in Assumption Pension Other Postretirement Benefits Total Increase in accounting cost: Discount rate Con Edison (0.25 )% $ 30 $ 5 $ 35 CECONY (0.25 )% $ 28 $ 4 $ 32 Expected return on plan assets Con Edison (0.25 )% $ 19 $ 3 $ 22 CECONY (0.25 )% $ 18 $ 2 $ 20 Health care trend rate Con Edison 1.00 % $ 3 $ 3 CECONY 1.00 % $ (2 ) $ (2 ) Increase in projected benefit obligation: Discount rate Con Edison (0.25 )% $ 297 $ 47 $ 344 CECONY (0.25 )% $ 279 $ 41 $ 320 Health care trend rate Con Edison 1.00 % $ 15 $ 15 CECONY 1.00 % $ (7 ) $ (7 ) A 5.0 percentage point variation in the actual annual return in 2010, as compared with the expected annual asset return of 8.50 percent, would change pension and other postretirement benefit costs for both Con Edison and CECONY by approximately $17 million and $16 million, respectively, in 2011. Pension benefits are provided through a pension plan maintained by Con Edison to which CECONY, O&R and the competitive energy businesses make contributions for their participating employees. Pension accounting by the Utilities includes an allocation of plan assets. The Companies policy is to fund their pension and other postretirement benefit accounting costs to the extent tax deductible, and for the Utilities, to the extent these costs are recovered under their rate agreements. The Companies were not required to make cash contributions to the pension plan in 2009 under funding regulations and tax laws. However, CECONY, O&R and Con Edison competitive energy businesses made discretionary contributions to the plan in 2009 of $257 million, $40 million and $1 million, respectively, and expect to make discretionary contributions in 2010 for CECONYand O&R of $391 million and $36 million, respectively. See Expected Contributions in Notes E and F to the financial statements in Item 8. Accounting for Contingencies The accounting rules for contingencies apply to an existing condition, situation or set of circumstances involving uncertainty as to possible loss that will ultimately be resolved when one or more future events occur or fail to occur. Known material contingencies, which are described in the notes to the financial statements, include the Utilities responsibility for hazardous substances, such as asbestos, PCBs and coal 48 Table of Contents tar that have been used or generated in the course of operations (Note G); certain tax matters (Notes J and L); and other contingencies (Note H). In accordance with the accounting rules, the Companies have accrued estimates of losses relating to the contingencies as to which loss is probable and can be reasonably estimated and no liability has been accrued for contingencies as to which loss is not probable or cannot be reasonably estimated. The Utilities generally recover costs for asbestos lawsuits, workers compensation and environmental remediation pursuant to their current rate plans. Changes during the terms of the rate plans to the amounts accrued for these contingencies would not impact earnings. Accounting for Long-Lived Assets The accounting rules for property, plant and equipment require that certain long-lived assets must be tested for recoverability whenever events or changes in circumstances indicate their carrying amounts may not be recoverable. The carrying amount of a long-lived asset is deemed not recoverable if it exceeds the sum of the undiscounted cash flows expected to result from the use and eventual disposition of the asset. Under the accounting rules an impairment loss is recognized if the carrying amount is not recoverable from such cash flows, and exceeds its fair value, which approximates market value. Accounting for Goodwill In accordance with the accounting rules for goodwill and other intangibles, Con Edison is required to test goodwill for impairment annually. See Note K to the financial statements in Item 8. Goodwill is tested for impairment using a two-step approach. The first step of the goodwill impairment test compares the estimated fair value of a reporting unit with its carrying value, including goodwill. If the estimated fair value of a reporting unit exceeds its carrying value, goodwill of the reporting unit is considered not impaired. If the carrying value exceeds the estimated fair value of the reporting unit, the second step is performed to measure the amount of impairment loss, if any. The second step requires a calculation of the implied fair value of goodwill. Goodwill was $416 million at December 31, 2009. The most recent test, which was performed during the first quarter of 2009, did not require any second-step assessment and did not result in any impairment. The company most significant assumptions surrounding the goodwill impairment test relate to the estimates of reporting unit fair values. The company estimated fair values based primarily on discounted cash flows and on market values for a proxy group of companies. Accounting for Derivative Instruments The Companies apply the accounting rules for derivatives and hedging to their derivative financial instruments. The Companies use derivative financial instruments to hedge market price fluctuations in related underlying transactions for the physical purchase and sale of electricity and gas and interest rate risk on certain debt securities. The Utilities are permitted by their respective regulators to reflect in rates all reasonably incurred gains and losses on these instruments. See Financial and Commodity Market Risks, below and Note O to the financial statements in Item 8. Where the Companies are required to make mark-to-market estimates pursuant to the accounting rules, the estimates of gains and losses at a particular period end do not reflect the end results of particular transactions, and will most likely not reflect the actual gain or loss at the conclusion of a transaction. Substantially all of the estimated gains or losses are based on prices supplied by external sources such as the fair value of exchange traded futures and options and the fair value of positions for which price quotations are available through or derived from brokers or other market sources. Accounting for Leases The Companies apply the accounting rules for leases and other related pronouncements to their leasing transactions. See Note J to the financial statements in Item 8 for information about Con Edison Development Lease In/Lease Out or LILO transactions, a disallowance of tax losses by the IRS and a favorable court decision in the company litigation with the IRS. In accordance with the accounting rules, 49 Table of Contents Con Edison accounted for the two LILO transactions as leveraged leases. Accordingly, the company investment in these leases, net of non-recourse debt, is carried as a single amount in Con Edison consolidated balance sheet and income is recognized pursuant to a method that incorporates a level rate of return for those years when net investment in the lease is positive, based upon the after-tax cash flows projected at the inception of the leveraged leases. Liquidity and Capital Resources The Companies liquidity reflects cash flows from operating, investing and financing activities, as shown on their respective consolidated statement of cash flows and as discussed below. The principal factors affecting Con Edison liquidity are its investments in the Utilities, the dividends it pays to its shareholders and the dividends it receives from the Utilities and cash flows from financing activities discussed below. The principal factors affecting CECONY liquidity are its cash flows from operating activities, cash used in investing activities (including construction expenditures), the dividends it pays to Con Edison and cash flows from financing activities discussed below. The Companies generally maintain minimal cash balances and use short-term borrowings to meet their working capital needs and other cash requirements. The Companies repay their short-term borrowings using funds from long-term financings and operating activities. The Utilities cost of capital, including working capital, is reflected in the rates they charge to their customers. Each of the Companies believes that it will be able to meet its reasonably likely short-term and long-term cash requirements. See The Companies Require Access to Capital Market to Satisfy Funding Requirements and The Companies Also Face Other Risks That Are Beyond Their Control in Item 1A, Application of Critical Accounting Policies Accounting for Contingencies, above, and Utility Regulation in Item 1. Changes in the Companies cash and temporary cash investments resulting from operating, investing and financing activities for the years ended December 31, 2009, 2008 and 2007 are summarized as follows: Con Edison (Millions of Dollars) 2009 2008 Variance 2009 vs. 2008 2007 Variance 2008 vs. 2007 Operating activities $ 2,466 $ 640 $ 1,826 $ 1,566 $ (926 ) Investing activities (2,360 ) (1,071 ) (1,289 ) (2,086 ) 1,015 Financing activities 80 295 (215 ) 636 (341 ) Net change 186 (136 ) 322 116 (252 ) Balance at beginning of period 74 210 (136 ) 94 116 Balance at end of period $ 260 $ 74 $ 186 $ 210 $ (136 ) CECONY (Millions of Dollars) 2009 2008 Variance 2009 vs. 2008 2007 Variance 2008 vs. 2007 Operating activities $ 2,222 $ 1,036 $ 1,186 $ 1,251 $ (215 ) Investing activities (2,108 ) (2,448 ) 340 (2,021 ) (427 ) Financing activities (20 ) 1,328 (1,348 ) 844 484 Net change 94 (84 ) 178 74 (158 ) Balance at beginning of period 37 121 (84 ) 47 74 Balance at end of period $ 131 $ 37 $ 94 $ 121 $ (84 ) 50 Table of Contents Cash Flows from Operating Activities The Utilities cash flows from operating activities reflect principally their energy sales and deliveries and cost of operations. The volume of energy sales and deliveries is dependent primarily on factors external to the Utilities, such as growth of customer demand, weather, market prices for energy, economic conditions and measures that promote energy efficiency. Under the revenue decoupling mechanisms in CECONY electric and gas rate plans and O&R New York electric and gas rate plans, changes in delivery volumes from levels assumed when rates were approved may affect the timing of cash flows but not net income. See Note B to the financial statements in Item 8. The prices at which the Utilities provide energy to their customers are determined in accordance with their rate agreements. In general, changes in the Utilities cost of purchased power, fuel and gas may affect the timing of cash flows but not net income because the costs are recovered in accordance with rate agreements. See Recoverable Energy Costs in Note A to the financial statements in Item 8. Net income is the result of cash and non-cash (or accrual) transactions. Only cash transactions affect the Companies cash flows from operating activities. Principal non-cash charges include depreciation and deferred income tax expense. Principal non-cash credits include amortizations of certain net regulatory liabilities, net derivative losses and the 2008 pre-tax gain on the sale of Con Edison Development ownership interests in electricity generating plants. Non-cash charges or credits may also be accrued under the revenue decoupling mechanisms in CECONY current electric and gas rate plans and O&R New York electric and gas rate plans. See Rate Agreements CECONY Electric and O&R Electric in Note B to the financial statements in Item 8. In March 2009, CECONY adopted unbilled revenue accounting which had the non-cash effect of increasing an accrued unbilled revenue receivable, within other current assets on the consolidated balance sheet, and regulatory liabilities. See Note A to the financial statements in Item 8. In September 2009, the Companies applied $109 million of a $160 million deposit paid to the IRS in 2007 to pay tax liabilities, and related interest, with respect to the timing of deductions of certain construction related costs. See Note L to the financial statements in Item 8. Net cash flows from operating activities in 2009 for Con Edison and CECONY were $1,826 million and $1,186 million higher, respectively, than in the 2008 period. The increases in net cash flows reflect the January 2008 semi-annual payment and July 2008 annual payment of CECONY New York City property taxes, compared with a semi-annual payment in July 2009. The Company achieved a 1.5 percent reduction in its New York City property taxes for the fiscal year ending June 30, 2009 by prepaying the annual tax amount in July 2008. The increase is offset by the effect of changes in commodity prices on cash collateral requirements under the Companies derivative instruments. For Con Edison, the increase also reflects the 2008 payment of income taxes on the gain on the sale of Con Edison Development ownership interests in electricity generating plants. Net cash flows from operating activities in 2008 for Con Edison and CECONY were $926 million and $215 million lower, respectively, than in the 2007 period. The decreases reflect primarily the July 2008 prepayment, by CECONY, of its annual New York City property taxes in the amount of $915 million. By prepaying this annual amount as opposed to paying in semi-annual installments, CECONY received a 1.5 percent reduction in its New York City property taxes. Con Edison decrease also reflects the 2008 payment of income taxes, which includes the taxes on the gain on the sale of Con Edison Development ownership interests in electricity generating plants. The decreases also reflect higher cash collateral paid due to lower commodity prices associated with the Companies derivative transactions. Con Edison and CECONY decrease is offset by lower rate case amortizations and the reconciliation of Net T&D in 2008 when compared with 2007. The change in net cash flows also reflects the timing of payments for and recovery of energy costs. This timing issue is reflected within changes to accounts receivable customers, recoverable energy costs and accounts payable balances. 51 Table of Contents The changes in regulatory assets principally reflects changes in deferred pension costs in accordance with the accounting rules for retirement benefits and changes in future federal income taxes associated with increased removal costs. See Notes A, B and E to the financial statements in Item 8. Cash Flows Used in Investing Activities Net cash flows used in investing activities for Con Edison were $1,289 million higher in 2009 compared with the 2008 period. The increase reflects primarily the absence of, in 2009, proceeds from the sale of Con Edison Development ownership interests in electricity generating plants in 2008, offset in part by decreased construction expenditures in 2009. Net cash flows used in investing activities for CECONY were $340 million lower in 2009 compared with the 2008 period reflecting primarily decreased construction expenditures and the repayment of loans by O&R. See Note S to the financial statements in Item 8. Net cash flows used in investing activities in 2008 for Con Edison were $1,015 million lower than in 2007. The decrease reflects primarily the proceeds from the sale of Con Edison Development ownership interests in electricity generating plants in 2008, offset in part by increased utility construction expenditures. Net cash flows used in investing activities for CECONY was $427 million higher in 2008 than in 2007, reflecting primarily increased utility construction expenditures in 2008. From time to time, CECONY lends funds to O&R for periods of not more than 12 months. CECONY outstanding loans to O&R amounted to $113 million at December 31, 2008. There were no outstanding loans to O&R at December 31, 2009. See Note S to the financial statements in Item 8. Cash Flows from Financing Activities Net cash flows from financing activities in 2009 for Con Edison and CECONY were $215 million and $1,348 million lower, respectively, than in 2008. In 2008, cash flows from financing activities for Con Edison were $341 million lower than in 2007 and for CECONY were $484 million higher in 2008 than in 2007. Con Edison cash flows from financing activities for the years ended December 31, 2009 and 2007, reflect the issuance through public offerings of 5 million and 11 million Con Edison common shares resulting in net proceeds of $213 million and $558 million, respectively. Most of the 2009 proceeds were invested by Con Edison in CECONY. The 2007 proceeds were invested by Con Edison in CECONY ($518 million) and O&R (and $40 million), respectively. For CECONY, cash flows from financing activities in 2008 also reflect a $752 million capital contribution from Con Edison. Cash flows from financing activities for 2009, 2008 and 2007 also reflect the issuance of Con Edison common shares through its dividend reinvestment and employee stock plans (2009: 2.4 million shares for $68 million, 2008: 1.7 million shares for $42 million, 2007: 3.6 million shares for $121 million). In addition, as a result of the stock plan issuances, cash used to pay common stock dividends was reduced by $48 million in 2009, $21 million in 2008 and $38 million in 2007. Net cash flows from financing activities during the years ended December 31, 2009, 2008 and 2007 also reflect the following CECONY transactions: 2009 Issued $275 million 5.55% 5-year debentures, $475 million 6.65% 10-year debentures and $600 million 5.50% 30-year debentures, the proceeds of which were used to redeem in advance of maturity $105 million 7.10% debentures and $75 million 6.90% debentures due 2028, to repay short-term borrowings and for other general corporate purposes; and Redeemed at maturity $275 million 4.70% 5-year debentures and $200 million 7.15% 10-year debentures. 2008 Issued $600 million 5.85% 10-year debentures, $600 million 6.75% 30-year debentures and $600 million 7.125% 10-year debentures, the proceeds of which were used to repay short-term borrowings and for other general corporate purposes; and 52 Table of Contents Redeemed at maturity $180 million 6.25% 10-year debentures and $100 million 6.15% 10-year debentures. 2007 Issued $525 million 6.30% 30-year debentures, the proceeds of which were used for general corporate purposes; and Redeemed at maturity $330 million 6.45% 10-year debentures. In 2008, Con Edison issued $326 million of unsecured notes in exchange for a like amount of secured project debt (see Note Q to the financial statements in Item 8) and redeemed at maturity $200 million 3.625% 5-year debentures. In 2007, Con Edison issued commercial paper and used available cash balances to redeem in advance of maturity $325 million 7.25% 40-year Public Income NotES. Con Edison net cash flows from financing activities also include O&R financings. In 2009, O&R issued $60 million 4.96% 10-year debentures and $60 million 6.00% 30-year debentures, the proceeds of which were used to redeem (in January 2010) $45 million 7.00% debentures due 2029, to repay short-term debt and for other general corporate purposes. In 2008, O&R issued $50 million 6.15% 10-year debentures. The net proceeds received from the issuance in 2008 were used for general corporate purposes, including repayment of short-term debt. In 2007, O&R New Jersey subsidiary redeemed at maturity $20 million 7.125% First Mortgage Bonds. Cash flows from financing activities of the Companies also reflect commercial paper issuance (included on the consolidated balance sheets as Notes payable ). The commercial paper amounts outstanding at December 31, 2009, 2008 and 2007 and the average daily balances for 2009, 2008 and 2007 for Con Edison and CECONY were as follows: 2009 2008 2007 (Millions of Dollars, except Weighted Average Yield) Outstanding at December 31 Daily average Outstanding at December 31 Daily average Outstanding at December 31 Daily average Con Edison $ $ 277 $ 363 $ 517 $ 840 $ 340 CECONY $ $ 169 $ 253 $ 380 $ 555 $ 151 Weighted average yield % 0.4 % 2.4 % 3.4 % 5.5 % 5.3 % Common stock issuances and external borrowings are sources of liquidity that could be affected by changes in credit ratings, financial performance and capital market conditions.

Other Changes in Assets and Liabilities The following table shows changes in certain assets and liabilities at December 31, 2009, compared with December 31, 2008. (Millions of Dollars) Con Edison 2009 vs. 2008 Variance CECONY 2009 vs. 2008 Variance Assets Accrued unbilled revenue $ 448 $ 413 Other current assets 162 47 Deferred derivative losses current (147 ) (143 ) Regulatory asset Unrecognized pension and other postretirement costs (1,130 ) (1,076 ) Liabilities Regulatory liability Net unbilled revenue deferrals 91 91 Regulatory liability Refundable energy costs-unbilled 44 39 Pension and retiree benefits (1,148 ) (1,081 ) 53 Table of Contents Accrued Unbilled Revenue Asset and Regulatory Liabilities In March 2009, CECONY began recording unbilled electric, gas and steam revenues in accordance with a NYSPSC order. See Note A to the financial statements in Item 8. Other Current Assets Other current assets increased $162 million and $47 million for Con Edison and CECONY, respectively, at December 31, 2009 compared with December 31, 2008. The increases reflect the Company reclassification from noncurrent assets of the deposit with the IRS. See Note L to the financial statements in Item 8. Deferred Derivative Losses Deferred derivative losses decreased $147 million and $143 million for Con Edison and CECONY, respectively, at December 31, 2009 compared with December 31, 2008. Although forward short-term electric and gas commodity prices are lower at December 31, 2009 compared with December 31, 2008, the change is due primarily to the impact of the maturity of certain contract positions, which were outstanding at December 31, 2008 and the timing of entering into new positions in 2009. Regulatory Asset Unrecognized Pension and Other Postretirement Costs and Pension and Retiree Benefits The decrease in regulatory assets and pension and retiree benefits liability reflects primarily an increase in the fair value of the companies retirement plan and other postretirement benefit plan assets including the funding of the plan. See Notes B, E and F to the financial statements in Item 8. Capital Requirements and Resources For information about capital requirements, contractual obligations and capital resources, see Capital Requirements and Resources in Item 1. Regulatory Matters For Information about the Utilities rate plans and other regulatory matters affecting the Companies, see Utility Regulation in Item 1 and Note B to the financial statements in Item 8. Financial and Commodity Market Risks The Companies are subject to various risks and uncertainties associated with financial and commodity markets. The most significant market risks include interest rate risk, commodity price risk, credit risk and investment risk. Interest Rate Risk The interest rate risk relates primarily to variable rate debt and to new debt financing needed to fund capital requirements, including the construction expenditures of the Utilities and maturing debt securities. Con Edison and its businesses manage interest rate risk through the issuance of mostly fixed-rate debt with varying maturities and through opportunistic refinancing of debt. Con Edison and CECONY estimate that at December 31, 2009, a 10 percent variation in interest rates applicable to its variable rate debt would not result in a material change in annual interest expense. Under CECONY current electric rate plan and O&R current New York gas rate plan, variations to long-term debt costs are reconciled to levels reflected in rates. Under CECONY current steam rate plan and O&R current New York electric rate plan, variations in variable tax-exempt debt interest expense are reconciled to the level set in rates. In addition, from time to time, Con Edison and its businesses enter into derivative financial instruments to hedge interest rate risk on certain debt securities. See Interest Rate Swaps in Note O to the financial statements in Item 8. Commodity Price Risk Con Edison commodity price risk relates primarily to the purchase and sale of electricity, gas and related derivative instruments. The Utilities and Con Edison competitive energy businesses have risk management strategies to mitigate their related exposures. See Note O to the financial statements in Item 8. Con Edison estimates that, as of December 31, 2009, a 10 percent decline in market prices would result in a decline in fair value of $129 million for the derivative instruments used by the Utilities to hedge purchases of electricity and gas, of which $104 million is for CECONY and $25 million is for O&R. Con Edison expects that any such change in fair value would be 54 Table of Contents largely offset by directionally opposite changes in the cost of the electricity and gas purchased. In accordance with provisions approved by state regulators, the Utilities generally recover from customers the costs they incur for energy purchased for their customers, including gains and losses on certain derivative instruments used to hedge energy purchased and related costs. See Recoverable Energy Costs in Note A to the financial statements in Item 8. Con Edison competitive energy businesses use a value-at-risk (VaR) model to assess the market risk of their electricity and gas commodity fixed-price purchase and sales commitments, physical forward contracts and commodity derivative instruments. VaR represents the potential change in fair value of instruments or the portfolio due to changes in market factors, for a specified time period and confidence level. These businesses estimate VaR across their electricity and natural gas commodity businesses using a delta-normal variance/covariance model with a 95 percent confidence level. Since the VaR calculation involves complex methodologies and estimates and assumptions that are based on past experience, it is not necessarily indicative of future results. VaR for transactions associated with hedges on generating assets and commodity contracts, assuming a one-day holding period, for the years ended December 31, 2009, and 2008, respectively, was as follows: (Millions of Dollars) 2009 2008 95% Confidence Level, One-Day Holding Period Average for the period $ 1 $ 2 High 2 3 Low Credit Risk The Companies are exposed to credit risk related to transactions entered into primarily for the various energy supply and hedging activities by the Utilities and the competitive energy businesses. Credit risk relates to the loss that may result from a counterparty nonperformance. The Companies use credit policies to manage this risk, including an established credit approval process, monitoring of counterparty limits, netting provisions within agreements and collateral or prepayment arrangements, credit insurance and credit default swaps. The Companies measure credit risk exposure as the replacement cost for open energy commodity and derivative positions plus amounts owed from counterparties for settled transactions. The replacement cost of open positions represents unrealized gains, net of any unrealized losses where the company has a legally enforceable right of setoff. The Utilities had $26 million of credit exposure in connection with energy supply and hedging activities, net of collateral, at December 31, 2009, of which $4 million was with investment grade counterparties and $22 million was with commodity exchange brokers. Con Edison competitive energy businesses had $150 million of credit exposure in connection with energy supply and hedging activities, net of collateral, at December 31, 2009, of which $118 million was with investment grade counterparties and $32 million was with commodity exchange brokers or independent system operators. Investment Risk The Companies investment risk relates to the investment of plan assets for their pension and other postretirement benefit plans. See Application of Critical Accounting Policies Accounting for Pensions and Other Postretirement Benefits, above. The Companies current investment policy for pension plan assets includes investment targets of 65 percent equities and 35 percent fixed income and other securities. At December 31, 2009, the pension plan investments consisted of 67 percent equity and 33 percent fixed income and other securities. Environmental Matters For information concerning climate change, environmental sustainability, potential liabilities arising from laws and regulations protecting the environment and other environmental matters, see Environmental Matters in Item 1 and Note G to the financial statements in Item 8. 55 Table of Contents Impact of Inflation The Companies are affected by the decline in the purchasing power of the dollar caused by inflation. Regulation permits the Utilities to recover through depreciation only the historical cost of their plant assets even though in an inflationary economy the cost to replace the assets upon their retirement will substantially exceed historical costs. The impact is, however, partially offset by the repayment of the Companies long-term debt in dollars of lesser value than the dollars originally borrowed. Material Contingencies For information concerning potential liabilities arising from the Companies material contingencies, see Application of Critical Accounting Policies Accounting for Contingencies, above, and Notes B, G, H, J and L to the financial statements in Item 8. Results of Operations Results of operations reflect, among other things, the Companies accounting policies (see Application of Critical Accounting Policies, above) and rate plans that limit the rates the Utilities can charge their customers (see Utility Regulation in Item 1). Under the revenue decoupling mechanisms currently applicable to CECONY electric and gas businesses and O&R electric and gas businesses in New York, the Utilities delivery revenues generally will not be affected by changes in delivery volumes from levels assumed when rates were approved. Revenues for CECONY steam business and O&R businesses in New Jersey and Pennsylvania are affected by changes in delivery volumes resulting from weather, economic conditions and other factors. See Note B to the financial statements in Item 8. The Companies results of operations for 2009, as compared with 2008, reflect changes in the Utilities rate plans (including additional revenues designed to recover increases in certain operations and maintenance expenses, depreciation and property taxes, interest charges and the impact of revenue decoupling mechanisms), a regulatory reserve in December 2009 relating to the NYSPSC review of capital spent during the period April 2005 through March 2008, and the operating results of the competitive energy businesses (including net mark-to-market effects). The results of operations for 2009 as compared with 2008 include a higher allowed return for the second, third and fourth quarters of 2009, offset in part by a lower allowed electric return on common equity for CECONY for the first quarter of 2009. Operations and maintenance expenses were higher in 2009 compared with 2008 reflecting primarily higher costs, which are generally reflected in rates, such as pension and other postretirement benefits and uncollectible accounts that were offset in part by austerity initiatives reflecting the general economic downturn. Depreciation and property taxes were higher in 2009 compared with 2008 reflecting primarily the impact from increased capital expenditures and higher property tax rates. Results of operations for 2008 include the gain on the sale of ownership interests in electricity generating plants, the impact of discontinued operations and resolution of litigation with Northeast Utilities. For additional information about major factors affecting earnings, see Results of Operations Summary, above. In general, the Utilities recover on a current basis the fuel, gas purchased for resale and purchased power costs they incur in supplying energy to their full-service customers (see Recoverable Energy Costs in Note A and Regulatory Matters in Note B to the financial statements in Item 8). Accordingly, such costs do not generally affect the Companies results of operations. Management uses the term net revenues (operating revenues less such costs) to identify changes in operating revenues that may affect the Companies results of operations. Management believes that, although net revenues may not be a measure determined in accordance with accounting principles generally accepted in the United States of America, the measure facilitates the analysis by management and investors of the Companies results of operations. A discussion of the results of operations by principal business segment for the years ended December 31, 2009, 2008 and 2007 follows. For additional business segment financial information, see Note N to the financial statements in Item 8. 56 Table of Contents Year Ended December 31, 2009 Compared with Year Ended December 31, 2008 The Companies results of operations (which were discussed above under Results of Operations Summary ) in 2009 compared with 2008 were: CECONY O&R Competitive Energy Businesses and Other(a) Con Edison(b) (Millions of Dollars) Increases (Decreases) Amount Increases (Decreases) Percent Increases (Decreases) Amount Increases (Decreases) Percent Increases (Decreases) Amount Increases (Decreases) Percent Increases (Decreases) Amount Increases (Decreases) Percent Operating revenues $ (388 ) (3.7 )% $ (101 ) (10.2 )% $ (62 ) (2.9 )% $ (551 ) (4.1 )% Purchased power (602 ) (18.9 ) (105 ) (24.2 ) (266 ) (12.5 ) (973 ) (16.9 ) Fuel (157 ) (23.8 ) N/A N/A (3 ) Large (160 ) (24.1 ) Gas purchased for resale (181 ) (18.1 ) (23 ) (14.5 ) (5 ) (35.7 ) (209 ) (17.8 ) Operating revenues less purchased power, fuel and gas purchased for resale (net revenues) 552 9.9 27 6.8 212 Large 791 13.2 Other operations and maintenance 249 12.9 25 11.3 22 22.0 296 13.1 Depreciation and amortization 72 10.7 2 5.0 74 10.3 Taxes, other than income taxes 182 14.0 1 2.3 (2 ) (12.5 ) 181 13.3 Gain on sale of ownership interests in electricity generating plants N/A N/A N/A N/A (261 ) Large (261 ) Large Operating income 49 2.9 (1 ) (1.1 ) (69 ) (43.1 ) (21 ) (1.1 ) Other income less deductions 17 Large (1 ) (33.3 ) (66 ) Large (50 ) (61.7 ) Net interest expense 61 12.4 6 25.0 67 12.3 Income from continuing operations, before taxes 5 0.4 (2 ) (2.9 ) (141 ) (71.2 ) (138 ) (9.5 ) Incomes taxes 7 1.8 2 8.3 (90 ) (87.4 ) (84 ) (16.0 ) Income from discontinued operations, net of tax(c) N/A N/A N/A N/A (274 ) Large (274 ) Large Net income for common stock $ (2 ) (0.3 )% $ (1 ) (2.3 )% $ (325 ) (88.1 )% $ (328 ) (27.4 )% (a) Includes inter-company and parent company accounting.

CECONY electric operating revenues decreased $204 million in 2009 compared with 2008 due primarily to lower purchased power ($563 million) and fuel costs ($129 million), offset in part by the 2009 electric rate plan ($368 million, which among other things, reflected a 10.0 percent return on common equity, effective April 2009, as compared with the 9.1 percent return previously reflected in rates) and an accrual for the revenue decoupling mechanism ($124 million). Effective April 2008, CECONY revenues from electric sales are subject to a revenue decoupling mechanism, as a result of which delivery revenues generally are not affected by changes in delivery volumes from levels assumed when rates were approved. Other electric operating revenues generally reflect changes in regulatory assets and liabilities in accordance with the revenue decoupling mechanism and other provisions of the company rate plans. See Note B to the financial statements in Item 8. Electric delivery volumes in CECONY service area decreased 2.8 percent in 2009 compared with 2008. After adjusting for variations, principally weather and billing days, electric delivery volumes in CECONY service area decreased 1.7 percent in 2009 compared with 2008, reflecting the impact of lower average normalized use per customer. CECONY electric purchased power costs decreased $563 million in 2009 compared with 2008 due to a decrease in unit costs ($480 million) and purchased volumes ($83 million). Electric fuel costs decreased $129 million in 2009 compared with 2008 due to lower unit costs ($88 million) and sendout volumes from the company electric generating facilities ($41 million). 58 Table of Contents CECONY electric operating income increased $35 million in 2009 compared with 2008. The increase reflects primarily higher net revenues ($488 million, due primarily to the electric rate plan, including the collection of a surcharge for a New York State assessment and the recovery of higher pension expense), offset by higher operations and maintenance costs ($216 million, due primarily to the surcharge for a New York State assessment ($108 million), higher pension expense ($80 million) and higher write-offs of uncollectible accounts ($11 million)), taxes other than income taxes ($171 million, principally property taxes) and depreciation ($66 million). Gas CECONY results of gas operations for the year ended December 31, 2009 compared with the year ended December 31, 2008 is as follows: Twelve Months Ended (Millions of Dollars) December 31, 2009 December 31, 2008 Variation Operating revenues $ 1,701 $ 1,839 $ (138 ) Gas purchased for resale 818 999 (181 ) Net revenues 883 840 43 Operations and maintenance 281 261 20 Depreciation and amortization 98 90 8 Taxes, other than income taxes 195 186 9 Gas operating income $ 309 $ 303 $ 6 CECONY gas sales and deliveries, excluding off-system sales, in 2009 compared with 2008 were: Thousands of dths Delivered Revenues in Millions Twelve Months Ended Twelve Months Ended Description December 31, 2009 December 31, 2008 Variation Percent Variation December 31, 2009 December 31, 2008 Variation Percent Variation Residential 39,749 40,195 (446 ) (1.1 )% $ 808 $ 850 $ (42 ) (4.9 )% General 28,245 28,748 (503 ) (1.7 ) 421 482 (61 ) (12.7 ) Firm transportation 48,671 43,245 5,426 12.5 266 202 64 31.7 Total firm sales and transportation 116,665 112,188 4,477 4.0 1,495 1,534 (39 ) (2.5 ) Interruptible sales 8,225 11,220 (2,995 ) (26.7 ) 75 138 (63 ) (45.7 ) NYPA 37,764 44,694 (6,930 ) (15.5 ) 4 4 Generation plants 68,157 74,082 (5,925 ) (8.0 ) 34 55 (21 ) (38.2 ) Other 18,297 20,004 (1,707 ) (8.5 ) 39 30 9 30.0 Other operating revenues 54 78 (24 ) (30.8 ) Total 249,108 262,188 (13,080 ) (5.0 )% $ 1,701 $ 1,839 $ (138 ) (7.5 )% CECONY gas operating revenues decreased $138 million in 2009 compared with 2008 due primarily to a decrease in gas purchased for resale costs ($181 million), offset in part by the 2008 gas rate plan ($59 million). CECONY revenues from gas sales are subject to a weather normalization clause and a revenue decoupling mechanism as a result of which delivery revenues are generally not affected by changes in delivery volumes from levels assumed when rates were approved. Other gas operating revenues generally reflect changes in regulatory assets and liabilities in accordance with the company rate plans. See Note B to the financial statements in Item 8. CECONY sales and transportation volumes for firm customers increased 4.0 percent in 2009 compared with 2008. After adjusting for variations, principally weather and billing days, firm gas sales and transportation volumes in the company service area increased 2.4 percent in 2009, reflecting primarily new business and transfers of interruptible customers to firm service, offset in part by lower average normalized use per customer. 59 Table of Contents CECONY purchased gas cost decreased $181 million in 2009 compared with 2008 due to lower unit costs ($152 million) and sendout volumes ($29 million). CECONY gas operating income increased $6 million in 2009 compared with 2008. The increase reflects primarily higher net revenues ($43 million), offset by higher operations and maintenance expense ($20 million, due primarily to a surcharge for a New York State assessment ($15 million)), taxes other than income taxes ($9 million, principally property taxes) and depreciation ($8 million). Steam CECONY results of steam operations for the year ended December 31, 2009 compared with the year ended December 31, 2008 is as follows: Twelve Months Ended (Millions of Dollars) December 31, 2009 December 31, 2008 Variation Operating revenues $ 661 $ 707 $ (46 ) Purchased power 54 93 (39 ) Fuel 256 284 (28 ) Net revenues 351 330 21 Operations and maintenance 171 158 13 Depreciation and amortization 59 61 (2 ) Taxes, other than income taxes 82 80 2 Steam operating income $ 39 $ 31 $ 8 CECONY steam sales and deliveries in 2009 compared with 2008 were: Millions of Pounds Delivered Revenues in Millions Twelve Months Ended Twelve Months Ended Description December 31, 2009 December 31, 2008 Variation Percent Variation December 31, 2009 December 31, 2008 Variation Percent Variation General 786 785 1 0.1 % $ 28 $ 23 $ 5 21.7 % Apartment house 5,962 6,614 (652 ) (9.9 ) 165 186 (21 ) (11.3 ) Annual power 16,269 16,577 (308 ) (1.9 ) 446 468 (22 ) (4.7 ) Other operating revenues 22 30 (8 ) (26.7 ) Total 23,017 23,976 (959 ) (4.0 )% $ 661 $ 707 $ (46 ) (6.5 )% CECONY steam operating revenues decreased $46 million in 2009 compared with 2008 due primarily to lower purchased power ($39 million) and fuel costs ($28 million), offset in part by the net change in rates under the steam rate plan ($27 million). Other steam operating revenues generally reflect changes in regulatory assets and liabilities in accordance with the company rate plans. See Note B to the financial statements in Item 8. Steam sales and delivery volumes decreased 4.0 percent in 2009 compared with 2008. After adjusting for variations, principally weather and billing days, steam sales and deliveries decreased 4.1 percent in 2009, reflecting the impact of lower average normalized use per customer. CECONY steam purchased power costs decreased $39 million in 2009 compared with 2008 due to a decrease in unit costs ($44 million), offset by an increase in purchased volumes ($5 million). Steam fuel costs decreased $28 million in 2009 compared with 2008 due to lower sendout volumes ($18 million) and unit costs ($10 million). Steam operating income increased $8 million in 2009 compared with 2008. The increase reflects primarily higher net revenues ($21 million) and lower depreciation ($2 million), offset by higher operations and maintenance expense ($13 million, due primarily to a surcharge for a New York State assessment ($5 million) and higher production expense ($6 million)) and taxes other than income taxes ($2 million, principally property taxes). 60 Table of Contents Taxes Other Than Income Taxes At over $1 billion, taxes other than income taxes remain one of CECONY largest operating expenses. The principal components of, and variations in, taxes other than income taxes were: (Millions of Dollars) 2009 2008 Increase/ (Decrease) Property taxes $ 1,135 $ 955 $ 180 (a) State and local taxes related to revenue receipts 282 283 (1 ) Payroll taxes 59 57 2 Other taxes 10 9 1 Total $ 1,486 (b) $ 1,304 (b) $ 182 (a) Property taxes increased $180 million reflecting primarily higher capital investments and New York City property tax rates. (b) Including sales tax on customers bills, total taxes other than income taxes, billed to customers in 2009 and 2008 were $1,866 million and $1,684 million, respectively. Income Taxes Income taxes increased $7 million in 2009 compared with 2008 due primarily to higher taxable income in the 2009 period. Other Income (Deductions) Other income (deductions) increased $17 million in 2009 compared with 2008 due primarily to higher income from the Deferred Income Plan returns in 2009. The Deferred Income Plan returns are also reflected in higher operations and maintenance expense. Net Interest Expense Net interest expense increased $61 million in 2009 compared with 2008 due primarily to new debt issuances in 2009 and late in 2008, offset in part by lower principal amounts of and rates on commercial paper outstanding in 2009.

Effective July 2008, O&R New York electric delivery revenues are subject to a revenue decoupling mechanism, as a result of which, delivery revenues are generally not affected by changes in delivery volumes from levels assumed when rates were approved. O&R electric sales in New Jersey and Pennsylvania are not part of a decoupling mechanism, and as a result, they do impact revenues. Other electric operating revenues generally reflect changes in regulatory assets and liabilities in accordance with the company electric rate plan. See Note B to the financial statements in Item 8. Electric delivery volumes in O&R service area decreased 5.6 percent in 2009 compared with 2008. After adjusting for weather variations and unbilled volumes, electric delivery volumes in O&R service area decreased 3.9 percent in 2009 compared with 2008, reflecting the impact of lower average normalized use per customer. Electric operating income decreased $4 million in 2009 compared with 2008. The decrease reflects primarily higher operations and maintenance expense ($22 million), due primarily to higher demand management program expenses ($7 million), a surcharge for a New York State assessment ($5 million) and higher pension expense ($4 million)), taxes other than income taxes ($1 million, principally property taxes) and depreciation ($1 million), offset by higher net revenues ($20 million). Gas O&R results of gas operations for the year ended December 31, 2009 compared with the year ended December 31, 2008 is as follows: Twelve Months Ended (Millions of Dollars) December 31, 2009 December 31, 2008 Variation Operating revenues $ 242 $ 258 $ (16 ) Gas purchased for resale 136 159 (23 ) Net revenues 106 99 7 Operations and maintenance 54 51 3 Depreciation and amortization 12 11 1 Taxes, other than income taxes 12 12 Gas operating income $ 28 $ 25 $ 3 62 Table of Contents O&R gas sales and deliveries, excluding off-system sales, in 2009 compared with 2008 were: Thousands of dths Delivered Revenues in Millions Twelve Months Ended Twelve Months Ended Description December 31, 2009 December 31, 2008 Variation Percent Variation December 31, 2009 December 31, 2008 Variation Percent Variation Residential 7,811 8,068 (257 ) (3.2 )% $ 132 $ 142 $ (10 ) (7.0 )% General 1,750 1,816 (66 ) (3.6 ) 27 30 (3 ) (10.0 ) Firm transportation 10,905 10,471 434 4.1 51 45 6 13.3 Total firm sales and transportation 20,466 20,355 111 0.5 210 217 (7 ) (3.2 ) Interruptible sales 4,502 5,409 (907 ) (16.8 ) 21 27 (6 ) (22.2 ) Generation plants 1,346 2,327 (981 ) (42.2 ) 2 4 (2 ) (50.0 ) Other 953 1,007 (54 ) (5.4 ) Other gas revenues 9 10 (1 ) (10.0 ) Total 27,267 29,098 (1,831 ) (6.3 )% $ 242 $ 258 $ (16 ) (6.2 )% O&R gas operating revenues decreased $16 million in 2009 compared with 2008 due primarily to the decrease in gas purchased for resale in 2009 ($23 million). Effective November 2009, O&R New York gas delivery revenues became subject to a revenue decoupling mechanism. Sales and transportation volumes for firm customers increased 0.5 percent in 2009 compared with 2008. After adjusting for weather and other variations, total firm sales and transportation volumes increased 0.2 percent in 2009 compared with 2008. O&R New York revenues from gas sales are subject to a weather normalization clause that moderates, but does not eliminate, the effect of weather-related changes on net income. Gas operating income increased $3 million in 2009 compared with 2008. The increase reflects primarily higher net revenues ($7 million), offset by higher operations and maintenance costs ($3 million) and depreciation ($1 million). Taxes Other Than Income Taxes Taxes, other than income taxes, increased $1 million in 2009 compared with 2008. The principal components of taxes, other than income taxes, were: (Millions of Dollars) 2009 2008 Increase/ (Decrease) Property taxes $ 28 $ 27 $ 1 State and local taxes related to revenue receipts 12 12 Payroll taxes 5 5 Total $ 45 (a) $ 44 (a) $ 1 (a) Including sales tax on customers bills, total taxes other than income taxes, billed to customers in 2009 and 2008 were $77 million and $78 million, respectively. Income Taxes Income taxes increased $2 million in 2009 compared with 2008. Other Income (Deductions) Other income (deductions) decreased $1 million in 2009 compared with 2008 due primarily to lower interest income in 2009. Net Interest Expense Net interest expense was the same in 2009 compared with 2008. Competitive Energy Businesses The competitive energy businesses earnings from continuing operations decreased $14 million in 2009 compared with 2008 due primarily to the after-tax gain on the sale of Con Edison Development ownership interests in electricity generating plants in 2008 ($131 million), offset in part by after-tax mark-to-market gains in 2009 versus mark-to-market losses in 2008 ($78 million) and higher retail electricity margins in 2009. Operating revenues decreased $48 million in 2009 compared with 2008, due primarily to lower electric wholesale and retail revenues and the sale of Con Edison Development ownership interests in electricity generating plants in 2008. Electric wholesale revenues decreased $312 million in 2009 as compared with 2008, due to lower sales volumes ($261 million) and 63 Table of Contents unit prices ($51 million). Electric retail revenues decreased $26 million, due to lower per unit prices ($187 million), offset by higher sales volume ($161 million). Electric retail revenues decreased 2 percent in 2009 as compared with 2008, due to lower electricity prices, while gross margins increased significantly due primarily to the sale of higher margin contracts, lower costs and higher volumes. Net mark-to-market gains increased $131 million in 2009 as compared with 2008 due primarily to higher prices on electric and natural gas contracts, of which $296 million in gains are reflected in revenues and $165 million in losses are reflected in purchased power costs. The competitive energy businesses no longer have revenues from the sale of electricity from owned generation projects due to the sale of ownership interests in electricity generating plants in the second quarter of 2008. These revenues were $21 million in 2008 (see Note U to the financial statements in Item 8). Other revenues increased $15 million in 2009 as compared with 2008 due primarily to higher sales of energy efficiency services. Operating expenses excluding income taxes decreased $240 million in 2009 compared with 2008, due primarily to decreased purchased power ($253 million), net of a $165 million increase in purchased power costs for mark-to-market losses, gas purchased for resale ($5 million) and fuel costs ($3 million) and taxes other than income taxes ($3 million), offset in part by higher operations and maintenance costs ($23 million). Income taxes decreased $62 million in 2009 as compared with 2008, due primarily to income taxes related to the sale of Con Edison Development ownership interests in electricity generating plants in 2008 ($130 million), offset in part by higher income due to mark-to-market gains and higher earnings from electric retail sales. Discontinued Operations Net income from discontinued operations was $274 million lower in 2009 compared with 2008, reflecting the 2008 sale of Con Edison Development ownership interests in electricity generating plants. See Note U to the financial statements in Item 8. Other For Con Edison, Other also includes the receipt of $30 million after-tax for a litigation settlement with Northeast Utilities in 2008 and inter-company eliminations relating to operating revenues and operating expenses. 64 Table of Contents Year Ended December 31, 2008 Compared with Year Ended December 31, 2007 The Companies results of operations (which were discussed above under Results of Operations Summary ) in 2008 compared with 2007 were: CECONY O&R Competitive Energy Businesses and Other(a) Con Edison(b) (Millions of Dollars) Increases (Decreases) Amount Increases (Decreases) Percent Increases (Decreases) Amount Increases (Decreases) Percent Increases (Decreases) Amount Increases (Decreases) Percent Increases (Decreases) Amount Increases (Decreases) Percent Operating revenues $ 539 5.5 % $ 55 5.9 % $ (131 ) (5.7 )% $ 463 3.5 % Purchased power 171 5.7 49 12.8 101 5.0 321 5.9 Fuel 72 12.2 N/A N/A (33 ) (91.7 ) 39 6.3 Gas purchased for resale 21 2.1 (7 ) (4.2 ) (15 ) (51.7 ) (1 ) (0.1 ) Operating revenues less purchased power, fuel and gas purchased for resale (net revenues) 275 5.2 13 3.4 (184 ) (90.2 ) 104 1.8 Other operations and maintenance 157 8.8 19 9.4 3 3.1 179 8.6 Depreciation and amortization 79 13.3 2 5.3 (9 ) (64.3 ) 72 11.2 Taxes, other than income taxes 41 3.2 2 4.8 (2 ) (11.1 ) 41 3.1 Gain on sale of ownership interests in electricity generating plants(c) N/A N/A N/A N/A 261 Large 261 Large Operating income (2 ) (0.1 ) (10 ) (9.7 ) 85 Large 73 4.0 Other income less deductions (20 ) (55.6 ) 3 Large 55 Large 38 Large Net interest expense 34 7.4 (6 ) (17.6 ) (1 ) (4.0 ) 27 5.2 Income from continuing operations, before taxes (56 ) (4.5 ) (1 ) (1.4 ) 141 Large 84 6.2 Income taxes 5 1.3 1 4.3 81 Large 87 19.9 Gain on sale of ownership interests in electricity generating plants, net of tax(c) N/A N/A N/A N/A 270 Large 270 Large Income from discontinued operations, net of tax (c) N/A N/A N/A N/A Net income for common stock $ (61 ) (7.2 )% $ (2 ) (4.3 )% $ 330 Large $ 267 28.7 % (a) Includes inter-company and parent company accounting.

O&R electric operating revenues increased $62 million in 2008 compared with 2007 due primarily to increased recoverable purchased power costs ($49 million) and the impact of the electric rate plan that went into effect July 1, 2008 ($8 million). Effective July 2008, O&R revenues from electric sales are subject to a revenue decoupling mechanism, as a result of which, revenues are generally not affected by changes in delivery volumes from levels assumed when rates were approved. Other electric operating revenues generally reflect changes in regulatory assets and liabilities in accordance with the company electric rate plan. See Note B to the financial statements in Item 8. Electric delivery volumes in O&R service area decreased 0.1 percent in 2008 compared with 2007. After adjusting for weather variations and unbilled volumes, electric delivery volumes in O&R service area decreased 1.0 percent in 2008 compared with 2007. Electric operating income decreased by $8 million in 2008 compared with 2007. The decrease reflects primarily higher operations and maintenance expense ($19 million, due primarily to higher maintenance costs ($6 million), pension expense ($4 million) and demand management program expenses ($3 million)), depreciation ($1 million) and taxes other than income taxes ($1 million, principally property taxes), offset by higher net revenues ($13 million). Gas O&R results of gas operations for the year ended December 31, 2008 compared with the year ended December 31, 2007 is as follows: Twelve Months Ended (Millions of Dollars) December 31, 2008 December 31, 2007 Variation Operating revenues $ 258 $ 265 $ (7 ) Gas purchased for resale 159 166 (7 ) Net revenues 99 99 Operations and maintenance 51 51 Depreciation and amortization 11 10 1 Taxes, other than income taxes 12 11 1 Gas operating income $ 25 $ 27 $ (2 ) 70 Table of Contents O&R gas sales and deliveries, excluding off-system sales, in 2008 compared with 2007 were: Thousands of dths Delivered Revenues in Millions Twelve Months Ended Twelve Months Ended Description December 31, 2008 December 31, 2007 Variation Percent Variation December 31, 2008 December 31, 2007 Variation Percent Variation Residential 8,068 8,768 (700 ) (8.0 )% $ 142 $ 152 $ (10 ) (6.6 )% General 1,816 2,066 (250 ) (12.1 ) 30 34 (4 ) (11.8 ) Firm transportation 10,471 10,248 223 2.2 45 39 6 15.4 Total firm sales and transportation 20,355 21,082 (727 ) (3.4 ) 217 225 (8 ) (3.6 ) Interruptible sales 5,409 5,983 (574 ) (9.6 ) 27 25 2 8.0 Generation plants 2,327 4,552 (2,225 ) (48.9 ) 4 3 1 33.3 Other 1,007 1,044 (37 ) (3.5 ) Other gas revenues 10 12 (2 ) (16.7 ) Total 29,098 32,661 (3,563 ) (10.9 )% $ 258 $ 265 $ (7 ) (2.6 )% O&R gas operating revenues decreased $7 million in 2008 compared with 2007 due primarily to the decrease in gas purchased for resale in 2008 ($7 million). Sales and transportation volumes for firm customers decreased 3.4 percent in 2008 compared with 2007, reflecting the impact of the weather in 2008. After adjusting for weather and other variations, total firm sales and transportation volumes were the same in 2008 compared with 2007. O&R revenues from gas sales are subject to a weather normalization clause that moderates, but does not eliminate, the effect of weather-related changes on net income. Gas operating income decreased by $2 million in 2008 compared with 2007. The decrease reflects primarily higher depreciation ($1 million) and taxes other than income taxes ($1 million, principally state and local taxes). Taxes Other Than Income Taxes Taxes, other than income taxes, increased $2 million in 2008 compared with 2007. The principal components of taxes, other than income taxes, were: (Millions of Dollars) 2008 2007 Increase/ (Decrease) Property taxes $ 27 $ 25 $ 2 State and local taxes related to revenue receipts 12 13 (1 ) Payroll taxes 5 4 1 Total $ 44 (a) $ 42 (a) $ 2 (a) Including sales tax on customers bills, total taxes other than income taxes, billed to customers in 2008 and 2007 were $78 million and $71 million, respectively. Income Taxes Income taxes increased $1 million in 2008 compared with 2007. Other Income (Deductions) Other income (deductions) increased $3 million in 2008 compared with 2007 due primarily to higher interest income in 2008. Net Interest Expense Net interest expense decreased $6 million in 2008 compared with 2007 due primarily to interest accrued for the potential repayment of tax benefits from the timing of tax deductions of certain construction related costs in 2007 (see Note L to the financial statements in Item 8). Competitive Energy Businesses The competitive energy businesses earnings from continuing operations increased $15 million in 2008 compared with 2007 due primarily to a $131 million gain on the sale of Con Edison Development ownership interests in electricity generating plants, offset by lower net income from generation projects, lower gross margins from electric wholesale and retail sales and mark-to-market losses. Income from continuing operations reflects a pre-tax gain of $261 million and income taxes of $130 million, related to the sale of Con Edison Development ownership interests in generating plants. 71 Table of Contents Operating revenues decreased $108 million in 2008 compared with 2007, due primarily to decreased electric generation and retail revenues. Revenue from the sale of electricity from the competitive energy businesses generation facilities decreased $87 million in 2008 as compared with 2007 due to the sale of Con Edison Development ownership interests in generating plants during the second quarter of 2008. Electric retail revenues decreased $54 million in 2008 as compared with 2007, due primarily to lower sales volumes ($181 million), offset by higher unit prices ($127 million). Electric retail revenues decreased 4 percent from 2007 to 2008 and gross margins decreased primarily due to lower volumes and lower per unit margins. Electric wholesale revenues increased $76 million, due primarily to higher per unit prices ($104 million), offset by lower sales volume ($28 million). Electric wholesale revenues increased by 9 percent from 2007 to 2008 and gross margin decreased primarily due to lower volumes and lower per unit margins. Net mark-to-market losses increased $91 million in 2008 as compared with 2007 due primarily to lower prices on electric and natural gas contracts, which were economic hedges for retail obligations (but were not accounted for as cash flow hedges). Other revenues increased $47 million in 2008 as compared with 2007 due primarily to energy services revenue. Operating expenses excluding income taxes increased $69 million in 2008 compared with 2007, reflecting increased purchased power costs ($125 million) and other operations and maintenance costs ($3 million), offset in part by lower depreciation ($9 million), fuel costs ($33 million), gas purchased for resale costs ($14 million) and taxes other than income taxes ($3 million). Other income decreased $12 million in 2008 as compared with 2007 due primarily to an impairment charge on investments in electric generating plants ($4 million) in 2008 and a gain from the sale of Con Edison Development interest in Everpower Wind LLC in 2007 ($6 million). Income taxes increased $56 million in 2008 as compared with 2007, due primarily to the sale of Con Edison Development ownership interests in generating plants. Discontinued Operations Net income from discontinued operations was the same in 2008 compared with 2007. See Note U to the financial statements in Item 8. Other For Con Edison, Other also includes the receipt of $30 million after-tax for a litigation settlement with Northeast Utilities in the nine months ended September 30, 2008 and inter-company eliminations relating to operating revenues and operating expenses. 72 Table of Contents
