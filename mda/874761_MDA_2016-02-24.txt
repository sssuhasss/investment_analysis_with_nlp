ITEM 7. MANAGEMENT'S DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS OF FINANCIAL CONDITION AND RESULTS OF OPERATIONS Key Topics in Management's Discussion and Analysis Our discussion covers the following: Strategic Performance and Overview of 2015 Results Review of Consolidated Results of Operations SBU Performance Analysis Key Trends and Uncertainties Capital Resources and Liquidity Overview of 2015 Results and Strategic Performance In 2015, we faced tough macroeconomic headwinds, including up to 30% devaluation in some of our key currencies, including the Brazilian Real, Colombian Peso and Euro. We also saw more than 40% declines in oil and natural gas prices, which have an impact on our businesses in the Dominican Republic, Ohio and Northern Ireland. Additionally, Brazil's GDP continued to contract. Despite these continuing challenging conditions, we did what we are good at adapted to the changes in circumstances and took actions to mitigate their impact on our businesses and on our financial results. We successfully executed on our strategy and achieved the majority of our objectives by: delivering Proportional Free Cash Flow of $1,241 million , up 39% compared to 2014, and Adjusted EPS of $1.22 ; prudently allocating our capital; and advancing select platform expansion projects across our portfolio. Management's Strategic Priorities Management is focused on the following priorities: 78 Reducing complexity: By exiting businesses and markets where we do not have a competitive advantage, we are simplifying our portfolio and reducing risk. During 2015, we announced or closed $787 million in equity proceeds from the sales or sell-downs of seven businesses. Leveraging our platforms: We are focusing our growth on platform expansions in markets where we already operate and have a competitive advantage to realize attractive risk-adjusted returns. We currently have 5,620 MW under construction, representing $7 billion in total capital expenditures, with 85% of AES' $1.2 billion in equity already funded. We expect the majority of these projects to come on-line through 2018. Beyond the projects we currently have under construction, we will continue to advance select projects from our development pipeline. Performance excellence: We strive to be the low-cost manager of a portfolio of assets and to derive synergies and scale from our businesses. In November, we launched a $150 million cost reduction and revenue enhancement initiative. This initiative will include overhead reductions, procurement efficiencies and operational improvements. We expect to achieve at least $50 million in savings in 2016, ramping up to $150 million, including modest revenue enhancements, in 2018. Expanding access to capital: We are building strategic partnerships at the project and business level. Through these partnerships, we aim to optimize our risk-adjusted returns in our existing businesses and growth projects. By selling down portions of certain businesses, we can adjust our global exposure to commodity, fuel, country and other macroeconomic risks. Partial sell-downs of our assets can also serve to highlight or enhance the value of businesses in our portfolio. Allocating capital in a disciplined manner: Our top priority is to maximize risk-adjusted returns to our shareholders, which we achieve by investing our discretionary cash and recycling the capital we receive from asset sales and strategic partnerships. In 2015, we generated substantial cash by executing on our strategy, which we allocated in line with our capital allocation framework: Used $345 million to prepay and refinance Parent debt; returned $757 million to shareholders through share repurchases and quarterly dividends; increased our quarterly dividend by 10%, to $0.11 per share, beginning in the first quarter of 2016; invested $114 million in our subsidiaries, largely for projects that are currently under construction. 2015 Strategic Performance Earnings Per Share and Proportional Free Cash Flow Results in 2015 (in millions, except per share amounts) Years Ended December 31, 2015 2014 2013 Diluted earnings per share from continuing operations $ 0.44 $ 1.09 $ 0.38 Adjusted earnings per share (a non-GAAP measure) (1) 1.22 1.30 1.29 Net cash provided by operating activities 2,134 1,791 2,715 Proportional Free Cash Flow (a non-GAAP measure) (1) 1,241 891 1,271 _____________________________ (1) See reconciliation and definition under Non-GAAP Measures. Diluted earnings per share from continuing operations decreased by 60% to $0.44 primarily due to higher impairment expense and lower gains from sales of businesses, partially offset by lower debt extinguishment expense. Adjusted EPS, a non-GAAP measure, decreased by 6% to $1.22 primarily due to the devaluation of foreign currencies in Latin America and Europe, the impact of lower commodity prices in certain markets, and lower demand in Brazil. These negative impacts were partially offset by a 5% reduction in shares outstanding, lower Parent interest expense, improved hydrological conditions in Panama, and contributions from new businesses, including Mong Duong in Vietnam. Net cash provided by operating activities increased by 19% to $2.1 billion primarily due to the timing of collections in the Dominican Republic as well as increases at the Parent Company primarily driven by lower interest payments and lower payments for capital expenditures, partially offset by collections on lower margins resulting from economic slowdown, timing of energy purchases and higher interest payments in Brazil. Proportional free cash flow increased by 39% to $1.2 billion primarily due to the timing of collections in the Dominican Republic as well as increases at the Parent Company primarily driven by lower interest payments and lower payments for maintenance capital expenditures. Safe Operations Safety is our first value and a top priority. We consistently analyze and evaluate our safety performance in order to capture lessons learned and strengthen mitigation plans that improve our safety performance. 79 Review of Consolidated Results of Operations Years Ended December 31, 2015 2014 2013 % Change 2015 vs. 2014 % Change 2014 vs. 2013 Results of operations (in millions, except per share amounts) Revenue: US SBU $ 3,593 $ 3,826 $ 3,630 -6 % 5 % Andes SBU 2,489 2,642 2,639 -6 % % Brazil SBU 4,666 6,009 5,015 -22 % 20 % MCAC SBU 2,353 2,682 2,713 -12 % -1 % Europe SBU 1,191 1,439 1,347 -17 % 7 % Asia SBU 684 558 550 23 % 1 % Corporate and Other 31 15 7 107 % 114 % Intersegment eliminations (44 ) (25 ) (10 ) -76 % -150 % Total Revenue 14,963 17,146 15,891 -13 % 8 % Operating Margin: US SBU 621 699 668 -11 % 5 % Andes SBU 618 587 533 5 % 10 % Brazil SBU 600 742 871 -19 % -15 % MCAC SBU 543 541 543 % % Europe SBU 303 403 415 -25 % -3 % Asia SBU 149 76 169 96 % -55 % Corporate and Other 33 53 25 -38 % 112 % Intersegment eliminations (1 ) (13 ) 23 92 % -157 % Total Operating Margin 2,866 3,088 3,247 -7 % -5 % General and administrative expenses (196 ) (187 ) (220 ) 5 % -15 % Interest expense (1,436 ) (1,471 ) (1,482 ) -2 % -1 % Interest income 524 365 275 44 % 33 % Loss on extinguishment of debt (186 ) (261 ) (229 ) -29 % 14 % Other expense (65 ) (68 ) (76 ) -4 % -11 % Other income 83 124 125 -33 % -1 % Gain on sale of businesses 29 358 26 -92 % NM Goodwill impairment expense (317 ) (164 ) (372 ) 93 % -56 % Asset impairment expense (285 ) (91 ) (95 ) 213 % -4 % Foreign currency transaction gains (losses) 105 11 (22 ) 855 % 150 % Other non-operating expense (128 ) (129 ) -100 % -1 % Income tax expense (465 ) (419 ) (343 ) 11 % 22 % Net equity in earnings of affiliates 105 19 25 453 % -24 % INCOME FROM CONTINUING OPERATIONS 762 1,176 730 -35 % 61 % Income (loss) from operations of discontinued businesses 27 (27 ) -100 % 200 % Net loss from disposal and impairments of discontinued operations (56 ) (152 ) -100 % -63 % NET INCOME 762 1,147 551 -34 % 108 % Noncontrolling interests: (Income) from continuing operations attributable to noncontrolling interests (456 ) (387 ) (446 ) 18 % -13 % Loss from discontinued operations attributable to noncontrolling interests 9 9 -100 % % NET INCOME ATTRIBUTABLE TO THE AES CORPORATION $ 306 $ 769 $ 114 -60 % 575 % AMOUNTS ATTRIBUTABLE TO THE AES CORPORATION COMMON STOCKHOLDERS: Income from continuing operations, net of tax $ 306 $ 789 $ 284 -61 % 178 % Loss from discontinued operations, net of tax (20 ) (170 ) -100 % -88 % Net income $ 306 $ 769 $ 114 -60 % 575 % Net cash provided by operating activities $ 2,134 $ 1,791 $ 2,715 19 % -34 % DIVIDENDS DECLARED PER COMMON SHARE $ 0.41 $ 0.25 $ 0.17 64 % 47 % _____________________________ NM Not meaningful Components of Revenue, Cost of Sales and Operating Margin Revenue includes revenue earned from the sale of energy from our utilities and the production of energy from our generation plants, which are classified as regulated and non-regulated on the Consolidated Statements of Operations, respectively. Revenue also includes the gains or losses on derivatives associated with the sale of electricity. Cost of sales includes costs incurred directly by the businesses in the ordinary course of business. Examples include electricity and fuel purchases, O&M costs, depreciation and amortization expense, bad debt expense and recoveries, general administrative and support costs (including employee-related costs directly associated with the operations of the business). Cost of sales also includes the gains or losses on derivatives (including embedded derivatives other than foreign currency embedded derivatives) associated with the purchase of electricity or fuel. Operating margin is defined as revenue less cost of sales. 80 Consolidated Revenue and Operating Margin Executive Summary (in millions) Year Ended December 31, 2015 Consolidated Revenue Revenue decrease d $2.2 billion , or 13% , to $15.0 billion in 2015 compared to $17.1 billion in 2014 . This decrease was primarily driven by unfavorable FX impacts of $2.5 billion , primarily in Brazil ($2.2 billion) and Colombia ($179 million). Additionally, there were lower volumes at the US Utilities, primarily at DPL, and outages, milder weather, and lower demand at IPL. Finally, there were lower prices in the Dominican Republic and El Salvador (primarily resulting from lower pass-through costs). These decreases were partially offset by higher tariffs at Eletropaulo and Sul (including higher pass-through costs), the reversal of a contingent regulatory liability at Eletropaulo, higher capacity prices at DPL, and the commencement of principal operations at Mong Duong in April 2015. Consolidated Operating margin Operating margin decrease d $222 million , or 7% , to $2.9 billion in 2015 compared to $3.1 billion in 2014 . This decrease was driven by unfavorable FX impacts of $368 million , primarily in Brazil ($235 million) and Colombia ($83 million). In addition, Brazil was impacted by lower demand, lower hydrology, and higher fixed costs and the Dominican Republic was impacted by lower commodities and lower availability. These decreases were partially offset by the impact of higher tariffs in Brazil as discussed above, lower spot prices on energy purchases at Tiet , higher generation and lower energy purchases driven by improved hydrological conditions in Panama, higher prices at Chivor driven by a strong El Ni o, and higher availability at Gener and Masinloc. Year Ended December 31, 2014 Consolidated Revenue Revenue increase d $1.3 billion , or 8% , to $17.1 billion in 2014 compared to $15.9 billion in 2013. This increase was driven by higher tariffs (primarily pass-through costs) at the Brazil Utilities and at IPL, higher spot prices at Tiet , and regulatory retail rate increases at DPL. These increases were partially offset by unfavorable FX impacts of $752 million , primarily in Brazil ($630 million), Argentina ($69 million) and Colombia ($30 million). Consolidated Operating Margin Operating margin decrease d $159 million , or 5% , to $3.1 billion in 2014 compared to $3.2 billion in 2013. This decrease was driven by unfavorable FX impacts of $124 million , primarily in Brazil ($97 million). In addition, margins were negatively impacted by higher fixed costs at Eletropaulo, lower hydrology and higher spot purchase prices Tiet , and lower availability at Kilroot, Maritza, and Masinloc. These decreases were partially offset by higher tariffs and a non-recurring 2013 charge related to the recognition of a contingent regulatory liability at Eletropaulo, and higher generation volumes and prices at Chivor. See Item 7. SBU Performance Analysis of this Form 10-K for additional discussion and analysis of operating results for each SBU. Consolidated Results of Operations Other General and administrative expenses General and administrative expenses include expenses related to corporate staff functions and/or initiatives, executive management, finance, legal, human resources and information systems, as well as global development costs. General and administrative expenses increase d $9 million , or 5% , to $196 million in 2015 from 2014 primarily due to increased business development costs and employee-related costs partially offset by decreased professional fees. General and administrative expenses decrease d $33 million , or 15% , to $187 million in 2014 from 2013 primarily due to lower employee-related costs and business development costs. 81 Interest expense Interest expense decrease d $35 million , or 2% , to $1.4 billion in 2015 from $1.5 billion in 2014 . The decrease was primarily attributable to lower interest expense of $63 million at the Parent Company due to a reduction in debt principal, and a $64 million reversal of interest expense previously recognized on a contingent regulatory liability at Eletropaulo. These decreases were partially offset by an increase at Mong Duong as the plant commenced operations in the first half of 2015 and ceased capitalizing interest, as well as the impact of the 2014 contingent interest reversal at Sul discussed below. Interest expense decrease d $ 11 million , or 1% , to $1.5 billion in 2014 from $1.5 billion in 2013 . This decrease was primarily attributable to lower interest expense of $53 million at the Parent Company due to a reduction in debt principal, and a $48 million reversal of contingent interest accruals associated with disputed purchased energy obligations at Sul for which it was determined, based on developments during the second quarter of 2014, that the likelihood of an unfavorable outcome for the payment of interest on the disputed obligation was no longer probable. These decreases were partially offset by income of $34 million in the prior year resulting from the ineffectiveness on derivative interest rate swaps accounted for as cash flow hedges at Puerto Rico, and higher interest expense of $24 million at Gener due to an increase in debt principal. Interest income Interest income increase d $159 million , or 44% , to $524 million in 2015 from $365 million in 2014 . The increase was primarily due to interest income of $114 million recognized in 2015 on the financing element of the service concession arrangement at Muong Duong, as well as an increase of $54 million at Eletropaulo and Sul resulting from higher interest rates and an increase in regulatory assets. Interest income increase d $90 million , or 33% , to $365 million in 2014 from $275 million in 2013 . The increase was primarily due to interest income of $59 million recognized on FONINVEMEM III receivables in Argentina, which satisfied the criteria for revenue recognition in the fourth quarter of 2014, as well as an increase of $23 million at Eletropaulo resulting from higher interest rates and an increase in regulatory assets. See Note 7 Financing Receivables included in Item 8. Financial Statements and Supplementary Data of this Form 10-K for further information. Loss on extinguishment of debt Loss on extinguishment of debt was $186 million for the year ended December 31, 2015 . This loss was primarily related to expense of $105 million, $22 million, and $19 million recognized on debt extinguishments at the Parent Company, IPL, and the Dominican Republic, respectively. Loss on extinguishment of debt was $261 million for the year ended December 31, 2014 . This loss was primarily related to expense of $193 million, $31 million, and $20 million recognized on debt extinguishments at the Parent Company, DPL, and Gener, respectively. Loss on extinguishment of debt was $229 million for the year ended December 31, 2013. This was primarily related to debt extinguishments at the Parent Company and at Masinloc. See Note 12 Debt included in Item 8. Financial Statements and Supplementary Data of this Form 10-K for further information. Other income and expense Other income was $83 million , $124 million , and $125 million for the years ended December 31, 2015 , 2014 , and 2013 , respectively. Other expense was $65 million , $68 million , and $76 million for the years ended December 31, 2015 , 2014 , and 2013 , respectively. See Note 20 Other Income and Expense included in Item 8. Financial Statements and Supplementary Data of this Form 10-K for further information. Gain on sale of businesses Gain on sale of businesses was $29 million for the year ended December 31, 2015 , which was primarily related to the sale of Armenia Mountain. Gain on sale of businesses was $358 million for the year ended December 31, 2014 , which was primarily related to the sale of 45% of the Company's interest in Masinloc, as well as the sale of U.K. Wind (Operating Projects). Gain on disposal and sale of investments for the year ended December 31, 2013 was $26 million , which was primarily related to the sale of our remaining 20% interest in Cartagena as well as the sale of our 10% equity interest in Trinidad Generation Unlimited. See Note 8 Investments in and Advances to Affiliates, Note 16 Equity, and Note 24 Dispositions and Held-For-Sale Businesses included in Item 8. Financial Statements and Supplemental Data of this Form 10-K for further information. Goodwill impairment expense The Company recognized goodwill impairment expense of $317 million , $164 million , and $372 million for the years 82 ended December 31, 2015 , 2014 , and 2013 , respectively. See Note 10 Goodwill and Other Intangible Assets included in Item 8. Financial Statements and Supplementary Data of this Form 10-K for further information. Asset impairment expense The Company recognized asset impairment expense of $285 million , $91 million and $95 million for the years ended December 31, 2015 , 2014 , and 2013 , respectively. See Note 21 Asset Impairment Expense included in Item 8. Financial Statements and Supplementary Data of this Form 10-K for further information. Income tax expense Income tax expense increase d $46 million , or 11% , to $465 million in 2015 . The Company's effective tax rates were 41% and 27% for the years ended December 31, 2015 and 2014 , respectively. The net increase in the 2015 effective tax rate was due, in part, to the current year nondeductible impairment of goodwill at our U.S. utility, DPL and Chilean withholding taxes offset by the release of valuation allowance at certain of our businesses in Brazil, Vietnam and the U.S. Further, the 2014 rate was impacted by the items described below. Income tax expense increase d $76 million , or 22% , to $419 million in 2014 . The Company's effective tax rates were 27% and 33% for the years ended December 31, 2014 and 2013 , respectively. The net decrease in the 2014 effective tax rate was due, in part, to the 2014 sale of approximately 45% of the Company's interest in Masin AES Pte Ltd., which owns the Company's business interests in the Philippines, and the 2014 sale of the Company's interests in four U.K. wind operating projects. Neither of these transactions gave rise to income tax expense. Further, the 2014 effective tax rate benefited from the release of valuation allowance against U.S. capital loss carryforwards and a change in tax status at a subsidiary operating in the Dominican Republic. Offsetting these items is the unfavorable impact of Chilean income tax law reform enacted in the third quarter of 2014. See Note 16 Equity for additional information regarding the sale of approximately 45% of the Company's interest in Masin-AES Pte Ltd. See Note 24 Dispositions and Held-for-Sale Businesses for additional information regarding the sale of the Company's interests in four U.K wind operating projects. Our effective tax rate reflects the tax effect of significant operations outside the U.S., which are generally taxed at rates lower than the U.S. statutory rate of 35%. A future proportionate change in the composition of income before income taxes from foreign and domestic tax jurisdictions could impact our periodic effective tax rate. The Company also benefits from reduced tax rates in certain countries as a result of satisfying specific commitments regarding employment and capital investment. See Note 22 Income Taxes for additional information regarding these reduced rates. Foreign currency transaction gains (losses) Foreign currency transaction gains (losses) in millions were as follows: Years Ended December 31, 2015 2014 2013 Argentina $ 124 $ 66 $ 2 Colombia 29 17 6 United Kingdom 11 12 2 Philippines 8 11 (10 ) Brazil (6 ) (4 ) (12 ) Mexico (6 ) (14 ) Chile (18 ) (30 ) (20 ) AES Corporation (31 ) (34 ) 5 Other (6 ) (13 ) 5 Total (1) $ 105 $ 11 $ (22 ) ___________________________________________ (1) Includes gains of $247 million , $172 million and $60 million on foreign currency derivative contracts for the years ended December 31, 2015 , 2014 and 2013 , respectively. The Company recognized a net foreign currency transaction gain of $105 million for the year ended December 31, 2015 primarily due to gains of: $124 million in Argentina, due to the favorable impact from foreign currency derivatives related to government receivables, partially offset by losses from the devaluation of the Argentine Peso associated with U.S. Dollar denominated debt, and losses at Termoandes (a U.S. Dollar functional currency subsidiary) primarily associated with cash and accounts receivable balances in local currency, $29 million in Colombia, primarily due to the depreciation of the Colombian Peso, positively impacting Chivor (a U.S. Dollar functional currency subsidiary) due to liabilities denominated in Colombian Pesos, $11 million in the United Kingdom, primarily due to the depreciation of the Pound Sterling, resulting in gains at Ballylumford Holdings (a U.S. Dollar functional currency subsidiary) associated with intercompany notes payable 83 denominated in Pound Sterling, and These gains were partially offset by losses of: $31 million at The AES Corporation primarily due to decreases in the valuation of intercompany notes receivable denominated in foreign currency, resulting from the weakening of the Euro and British Pound during the year, partially offset by gains related to foreign currency option purchases, and $18 million in Chile primarily due to the devaluation of the Chilean Peso at Gener (a U.S. Dollar functional currency subsidiary) from working capital denominated in Chilean Pesos, partially offset by gains on foreign currency derivatives. The Company recognized a net foreign currency transaction gain of $11 million for the year ended December 31, 2014 primarily due to gains of: $66 million in Argentina, due to the favorable impact from foreign currency derivatives related to government receivables, partially offset by losses from the devaluation of the Argentine Peso associated with U.S. Dollar denominated debt, and losses at Termoandes (a U.S. Dollar functional currency subsidiary) primarily associated with cash and accounts receivable balances in local currency, and the purchase of Argentine sovereign bonds, $17 million in Colombia, primarily due to a 23% depreciation of the Colombian Peso, positively impacting Chivor (a U.S. Dollar functional currency subsidiary) due to liabilities denominated in Colombian Pesos, primarily income tax payable and accounts payable, $12 million in the United Kingdom, primarily due to a 6% depreciation of the Pound Sterling, resulting in gains at Ballylumford Holdings (a U.S. Dollar functional currency subsidiary) associated with intercompany notes payable denominated in Pound Sterling, and gains related to foreign currency derivatives, and $11 million in the Philippines, primarily due to amortization of frozen embedded derivatives and a 4% appreciation of the Philippine Peso against the U.S. Dollar, resulting in a revaluation of cash accounts, customer receivables, and deferred tax asset. These gains were partially offset by losses of: $34 million at The AES Corporation primarily due to decreases in the valuation of intercompany notes receivable denominated in foreign currency, resulting from the weakening of the Euro and British Pound during the year, partially offset by gains related to foreign currency option purchases, $30 million in Chile primarily due to a 16% devaluation of the Chilean Peso, resulting in a $39 million loss at Gener (a U.S. Dollar functional currency subsidiary) from working capital denominated in Chilean Pesos, primarily cash, accounts receivable and VAT receivables, partially offset by income of $9 million on foreign currency derivatives, and $14 million in Mexico, primarily due to a 13% devaluation of the Mexican Peso, resulting in a loss at TEGTEP and Merida (U.S. Dollar functional currency subsidiaries) from working capital denominated in Pesos (primarily cash, recoverable tax, and VAT). The Company recognized a net foreign currency transaction loss of $22 million for the year ended December 31, 2013 primarily due to losses of: $20 million in Chile, primarily due to a 9% weakening of the Chilean Peso, resulting in losses at Gener (a U.S. Dollar functional currency subsidiary) associated with net working capital denominated in Chilean Pesos, mainly cash, accounts receivables and tax receivables, partially offset by gains related to foreign currency derivatives, $12 million in Brazil, primarily due to a 15% weakening of the Brazilian Real resulting in losses mainly associated with U.S. Dollar denominated liabilities, and $10 million in the Philippines (a U.S. Dollar functional currency subsidiary beginning in 2013), primarily due to the 8% weakening of the Philippine Peso, resulting in revaluation of cash accounts, customer receivables and deferred tax assets. Other non-operating expense Other non-operating expense was zero , $128 million and $129 million for the years ended December 31, 2015 , 2014 and 2013 , respectively. See Note 9 Other Non-Operating Expense included in Item 8. Financial Statements and Supplementary Data of this Form 10-K for further information. Net equity in earnings of affiliates Net equity in earnings of affiliates increase d $86 million , or 453% , to $105 million in 2015 from $19 million in 2014 . The increase was primarily due to the 2015 restructuring of Guacolda in Chile, which increased the Company's equity investment and resulted in additional equity earnings, as well as the 2014 impairment at Elsta discussed below. 84 Net equity in earnings of affiliates decrease d $6 million to $19 million in 2014 from $25 million in 2013 . The decrease was primarily a result of an asset impairment charge at Elsta due to long lived assets that were determined to not be recoverable of which our share was $41 million. These items were partially offset by a $22 million lower loss recognized at Entek on an embedded foreign currency derivative and a $19 million increase as a result of the sale of equity interests in SRP. See Note 8 Investments in and Advances to Affiliates included in Item 8. Financial Statements and Supplementary Data of this Form 10-K for further information. Income from continuing operations attributable to noncontrolling interests Income from continuing operations attributable to noncontrolling interests increase d $69 million , or 18% , to $456 million in 2015 from $387 million in 2014 as a result of: an increase at Mong Duong due to commencement of operations in the current year, an increase at Gener primarily due to the restructuring of Guacolda, an increase at Masinloc due to increased earnings and the 2014 sale of a noncontrolling interest in that business Partially offset by a decrease at Buffalo Gap III resulting from the asset impairment expense allocation to the tax equity partner, and a decease at Eletropaulo resulting from unfavorable foreign exchange and lower demand. Income from continuing operations attributable to noncontrolling interests decrease d $59 million , or 13% , to $387 million in 2014 from $446 million in 2013 as a result of: a decrease at Tiet due to lower earnings resulting from poor hydrology and increased prices for purchased energy, a decrease at Uruguaiana due to a favorable arbitration settlement in 2013, and a decrease at Panama related to poor hydrology. Loss from discontinued operations Total loss from discontinued operations was zero , $29 million , and $179 million for the years ended December 31, 2015 , 2014 and 2013 , respectively. See Note 23 Discontinued Operations included in Item 8. Financial Statements and Supplementary Data of this Form 10-K for further information. Net income attributable to The AES Corporation Net income attributable to The AES Corporation decrease d $463 million to $306 million in 2015 from $769 million in 2014 . The key drivers of the decrease included: Higher impairment expense Lower gains from the sale of businesses These increases were partially offset by: Lower debt extinguishment expense Net income attributable to The AES Corporation increased $655 million to $769 million in 2014 from $114 million in 2013 . The key drivers of the increase included: Higher gains from the sale of businesses Lower impairment expense Lower general and administrative expenses SBU Performance Analysis Non-GAAP Measures Adjusted Operating Margin, Adjusted PTC, Adjusted EPS, and Proportional Free Cash Flow are non-GAAP supplemental measures that are used by management and external users of our consolidated financial statements such as investors, industry analysts and lenders. Adjusted Operating Margin Operating Margin is defined as revenue less cost of sales. Cost of sales includes costs incurred directly by the businesses in the ordinary course of business, such as Electricity and fuel purchases; O&M costs; Depreciation and amortization expense; Bad debt expense & recoveries; General administrative & support costs at the businesses; and Gains or losses on derivatives associated with the purchase and sale of electricity or fuel. We define Adjusted Operating Margin as Operating Margin, adjusted for the impact of noncontrolling interests, excluding 85 unrealized gains or losses related to derivative transactions. The GAAP measure most comparable to Adjusted Operating Margin is Operating Margin. We believe that Adjusted Operating Margin better reflects the underlying business performance of the Company. Factors in this determination include the impact of noncontrolling interests, where AES consolidates the results of a subsidiary that is not wholly-owned by the Company, as well as the variability due to unrealized derivatives gains or losses. Adjusted Operating Margin should not be construed as an alternative to Operating Margin, which is determined in accordance with GAAP. Adjusted PTC and Adjusted EPS We define Adjusted PTC as pretax income from continuing operations attributable to The AES Corporation excluding gains or losses due to (a) unrealized gains or losses related to derivative transactions, (b) unrealized foreign currency gains or losses, (c) gains or losses due to dispositions and acquisitions of business interests, (d) losses due to impairments, and (e) costs due to the early retirement of debt. Adjusted PTC reflects the impact of noncontrolling interests and excludes the items specified in the definition above. In addition to the revenue and cost of sales reflected in Operating Margin, Adjusted PTC includes the other components of our income statement, such as General and administrative expense in the corporate segment, as well as business development costs; Interest expense and interest income; Other expense and other income; Realized foreign currency transaction gains and losses; and Net equity in earnings of affiliates. We define Adjusted EPS as diluted earnings per share from continuing operations excluding gains or losses due to (a) unrealized gains or losses related to derivative transactions, (b) unrealized foreign currency gains or losses, (c) gains or losses due to dispositions and acquisitions of business interests, (d) losses due to impairments, and (e) costs due to the early retirement of debt. The GAAP measure most comparable to Adjusted PTC is income from continuing operations attributable to The AES Corporation. The GAAP measure most comparable to Adjusted EPS is diluted earnings per share from continuing operations. We believe that Adjusted PTC and Adjusted EPS better reflect the underlying business performance of the Company and are considered in the Company's internal evaluation of financial performance. Factors in this determination include the variability due to unrealized gains or losses related to derivative transactions, unrealized foreign currency gains or losses, losses due to impairments and strategic decisions to dispose of or acquire business interests or retire debt, which affect results in a given period or periods. In addition, for Adjusted PTC, earnings before tax represents the business performance of the Company before the application of statutory income tax rates and tax adjustments, including the effects of tax planning, corresponding to the various jurisdictions in which the Company operates. Adjusted PTC and Adjusted EPS should not be construed as alternatives to income from continuing operations attributable to The AES Corporation and diluted earnings per share from continuing operations, which are determined in accordance with GAAP.

AES owns 100% of its businesses in the US with the exception of IPL with ownership of 85% beginning in February 2015 and 75% beginning in April 2015. AES owned 100% of IPL prior to February 2015. Adjusted PTC decrease d $85 million driven by the decrease of $113 million in Adjusted Operating Margin described above and a decrease in the Company's share of earnings under the HLBV allocation of noncontrolling interest at Buffalo Gap, partially offset by IPL due to lower interest expense related to the impact of the sell down and increased AFUDC, and DPL due to lower interest expense. Proportional Free Cash Flow decreased $55 million , which includes the $113 million decrease in Adjusted Operating Margin as described above as well as a $22 million increase in maintenance and non-recoverable capital expenditures, partially offset by the collection of previously deferred storm costs, a one-time payment in 2014 to terminate an unfavorable coal contract, higher collections and the timing of inventory payments at DPL. Cash was also favorably impacted by the timing of collections and payments for energy at IPL as well as a reduction in interest payments. 88 Fiscal year 2014 versus 2013 Operating margin increase d by $31 million , or 5% , which was driven primarily by the following: U.S. Generation Increased availability at Hawaii $ 11 Increased market prices at Laurel Mountain 8 Completion of the Tait energy storage project in September 2013 8 Other (1 ) Total US Generation Increase 26 IPL Higher wholesale margin 14 Lower fixed costs, primarily due to lower pension expense 11 Other (1 ) Total IPL Increase 24 DPL Impact from the timing of outages, resulting in higher purchased power and related costs, lower gas availability and higher demand during the peak of cold weather in Q1 2014, as well as increased customer switching to third party CRES providers (71 ) Higher rates resulting from increased retail prices, lower fuel costs, and higher capacity prices 57 Other (5 ) Total DPL Decrease (19 ) Total US SBU Operating Margin Increase $ 31 Adjusted Operating Margin increase d $27 million due to the drivers above, excluding the impact of unrealized derivative gains and losses. AES owned 100% of its businesses in the US in 2014, so there is no adjustment for noncontrolling interests. Adjusted PTC increase d $5 million driven by net gains of $53 million recognized resulting from the early termination of the PPA and coal supply contract at Beaver Valley during the first quarter of 2013, largely offset by an increase of $27 million in Adjusted Operating Margin described above as well as an increase in the Company's share of earnings under the HLBV allocation of noncontrolling interest at Buffalo Gap and Armenia Wind of $13 million and settlements at Laurel Mountain of $6 million. Proportional Free Cash Flow decreased $43 million driven by the one-time cash receipt in 2013 upon the early termination of the PPA at Beaver Valley as well as the timing of legal settlements at Laurel Mountain as described above. Additionally, cash was unfavorably impacted by the timing of payments at IPL for energy, maintenance and inventory and a one-time payment at DPL in the fourth quarter of 2014 to terminate an unfavorable coal contract. These unfavorable impacts were partially offset by the $27 million increase in Adjusted Operating Margin as described above, a $ 51 million reduction in maintenance capital expenditures, primarily at our Utility businesses, as well as the timing of fuel payments and a reduction in interest payments at DPL. ANDES SBU A summary of Operating Margin, Adjusted Operating Margin, Adjusted PTC, and Proportional Free Cash Flow ($ in millions) is as follows: For the Years Ended December 31, 2015 2014 2013 $ Change 2015 vs. 2014 $ Change 2014 vs. 2013 % Change 2015 vs. 2014 % Change 2014 vs. 2013 Operating Margin $ 618 $ 587 $ 533 $ 31 $ 54 5 % 10 % Noncontrolling Interests Adjustment (152 ) (143 ) (131 ) Adjusted Operating Margin $ 466 $ 444 $ 402 $ 22 $ 42 5 % 10 % Adjusted PTC $ 482 $ 421 $ 353 $ 61 $ 68 14 % 19 % Proportional Free Cash Flow $ 224 $ 176 $ 188 $ 48 $ (12 ) 27 % -6 % 89 Fiscal year 2015 versus 2014 Including the unfavorable impact of foreign currency translation and remeasurement of $87 million , operating margin increase d $31 million , or 5% , which was driven primarily by the following: Gener Higher margins associated to Nueva Renca Plant tolling agreement $ 26 Higher volume of energy sales mainly related to higher availability 21 Other (2 ) Total Gener Increase 45 Argentina Higher rates driven by an annual price review and additional contributions introduced by Resolution 482 49 Higher fixed costs primarily driven by higher inflation and by higher maintenance cost (45 ) Unfavorable FX remeasurement impacts (4 ) Other 4 Total Argentina Increase 4 Chivor Unfavorable FX remeasurement impacts (83 ) Higher rates driven by a strong El Ni o impact on prices 60 Higher volume of energy sales mainly associated to higher generation 12 Other (7 ) Total Chivor Decrease (18 ) Total Andes SBU Operating Margin Increase $ 31 Adjusted Operating Margin increase d $22 million for the year due to the drivers above, adjusted for the impact of noncontrolling interests. AES owned 71% of Gener and Chivor prior to sell down effective December 2015 which resulted in ownership of 67%. AES Argentina is owned 100%. The Alto Maipo and Cochrane plants under construction are owned 40%. Adjusted PTC increase d $61 million , driven by a restructuring of Guacolda in Chile which increased our equity investment and resulted in additional equity in earnings of $46 million, realized FX gains, lower interest expense at Chivor and the increase of $22 million in Adjusted Operating Margin described above. This was partially offset by lower equity earnings at Guacolda of $16 million (excluding restructuring impact above) mainly driven by a 2014 gain on sale of a transmission line. Proportional Free Cash Flow increased $48 million , primarily driven by higher VAT refunds at Cochrane and Alto Maipo, the timing of non-recurring maintenance collections at Alicura, a decrease in interest payments as well as a $17 million net reduction in maintenance and non-recoverable environmental capital expenditures. Excluding the $22 million collection delay resulting from the various resolutions passed by the Argentine government (as discussed in Note 7 Financing Receivables ), Adjusted Operating Margin decreased by $4 million due to the drivers discussed above. Additionally, cash flow was negatively impacted by higher tax payments and lower collections from contract customers at Chivor as well as a one-time swap termination payment at Ventanas. Fiscal year 2014 versus 2013 Including the unfavorable impact of foreign currency translation and remeasurement of $14 million , operating margin for 2013 increase d $54 million , or 10% , which was driven primarily by the following: Chivor Higher generation, higher spot and contract prices, and higher ancillary services $ 72 Higher maintenance costs (12 ) Unfavorable FX impacts (9 ) Other 4 Total Chivor Increase 55 Argentina Higher rates as a result of the impact of Resolution 529 30 Higher generation and availability 13 Higher fixed costs driven by higher inflation (27 ) Unfavorable FX impacts (5 ) Other (3 ) Total Argentina Increase 8 Gener Lower contract prices, spot prices in the SADI, and lower Energy Plus margin (32 ) Lower availability (9 ) Contributions from Ventanas IV, which commenced operations in March 2013 10 Lower fixed costs, primarily lower maintenance and salaries 19 Other 3 Total Gener Decrease (9 ) Total Andes SBU Operating Margin Increase $ 54 90 Adjusted Operating Margin increase d $42 million for the year due to the drivers above, adjusted for the impact of noncontrolling interests.

Adjusted PTC increase d $68 million driven by the increase of $42 million in Adjusted Operating Margin described above, and a net benefit of $45 million related to FONINVEMEM interest income on receivables in 2014 and 2013, partially offset by realized FX losses at Gener as well as non-recurring equity tax reversal of $8 million at Chivor in 2013. Proportional Free Cash Flow decreased $12 million driven by an increase in interest payments, higher payments for VAT at our Cochrane plant, a one-time swap termination payment at Angamos as well as a $3 million net increase in maintenance and non-recoverable environmental capital expenditures. These unfavorable impacts were partially offset by the $42 million increase in Adjusted Operating Margin as described above as well a reduction in tax payments at Chivor and Gener.

Adjusted PTC decrease d $151 million , driven by the decrease of $99 million in Adjusted Operating Margin described above, a reversal of $47 million in contingent interest accruals in 2014 as well as higher debt and interest rates in 2015 at Sul. These results were partially offset by favorable net interest income recognized on receivables at Eletropaulo and Sul. Proportional Free Cash Flow decreased $42 million , which includes the $99 million decrease in Adjusted Operating Margin as described above as well as an increase in interest payments, partially offset by the timing of energy purchases and regulatory charges, lower tax payments as well as a $25 million reduction in maintenance capital expenditures. 91 Fiscal year 2014 versus 2013 Including the unfavorable impact of foreign currency translation of $97 million , operating margin decrease d $129 million , or 15% , which was driven primarily by the following: Tiet Net impact of lower hydrology, which led to lower generation and an increase in energy purchases at higher prices, partially offset by higher spot sales in the first half of 2014 due to lower contracted volumes of energy sold $ (252 ) Unfavorable FX impacts (58 ) Other (5 ) Total Tiet Decrease (315 ) Uruguaiana Extinguishment of a liability based on a favorable arbitration decision in the second quarter of 2013, partially offset by higher generation in 2014 during the period of temporary restart of operations (53 ) Other 2 Total Uruguaiana Decrease (51 ) Eletropaulo Non-recurring 2013 charge related to the recognition of a contingent regulatory liability related to potential customer refunds 198 Higher rates driven by a higher tariff 124 Higher volumes 46 Higher fixed costs and depreciation, primarily related to personnel and pension costs (133 ) Unfavorable FX impacts (28 ) Total Eletropaulo Increase 207 Sul Higher volumes and rates 52 Higher fixed costs and depreciation (11 ) Unfavorable FX impacts (10 ) Total Sul Increase 31 Other Business Drivers (1 ) Total Brazil SBU Operating Margin Decrease $ (129 ) Adjusted Operating Margin decreased $36 million primarily due to the drivers discussed above, adjusted for the impact of noncontrolling interests.

Proportional Free Cash Flow decreased $103 million , which includes the $36 million decrease in Adjusted Operating Margin as described above with the exception of the non-recurring 2013 charge related to potential customer refunds as that balance was not fully paid. The Brazil SBU was also unfavorably impacted by an increase in tax payments at Sul and Eletropaulo, the timing of collections of regulatory assets and settlement of regulatory liabilities at Eletropaulo and an increase in interest payments at Sul as noted above. These decreases were partially offset by a $19 million reduction in maintenance capital expenditures as well as the timing of energy purchases at Tiet .

Adjusted PTC increased $13 million , driven by the increase in Adjusted Operating Margin of $10 million described above. Proportional Free Cash Flow decreased $152 million primarily due to a one-time settlement received in 2013 at the Dominican Republic resulting from a fuel contract amendment, an increase in tax payments, as well as the timing of energy purchases at Panama, partially offset by the $10 million increase in Adjusted Operating Margin as described above.

Adjusted PTC decreased $113 million , driven primarily by the decrease of $97 million in Adjusted Operating Margin described above and by higher depreciation and unfavorable FX impact from Elsta as well as unfavorable impact due to the reversal of a liability in 2014 in Kazakhstan. These results partially offset by lower interest expenses in Bulgaria. Proportional Free Cash Flow increased $41 million , which is primarily driven by higher collections at Maritza and Kavarna in Bulgaria, IPP4 in Jordan and at Ballylumford, partially offset by the $97 million decrease in Adjusted Operating Margin as described above.

Proportional Free Cash Flow decreased $148 million , which includes the $19 million decrease in Adjusted Operating Margin as described above as well as the loss of cash flow resulting from the sale of our businesses in Cameroon and the Ukraine. Cash was also unfavorably impacted by the timing of collections at Maritza, Ballylumford and Jordan as well as pension plan contributions at Kilroot. These drivers were partially offset by an increase in dividends received at Elsta, our equity method investment in the Netherlands.

AES also owns 90% of Kelanitissa and 51% of Mong Duong. Adjusted PTC increase d $50 million , driven by the increase of $19 million in Adjusted Operating Margin described above, and the additional net impact of $28 million at Mong Duong due to a component of service concession revenue recognized as interest income, net of higher interest expense as interest is no longer capitalized. See Note 1 General and Summary of Significant Accounting Policies in Part II. Item 8. Financial Statements and Supplementary Data for further information regarding the accounting for service concession arrangements. Proportional Free Cash Flow increased $5 million , driven by the collection of service concession revenue at Mong Duong noted above (which is not included in operating margin) as well as the $19 million increase in Adjusted Operating Margin, but excluding the retrospective adjustment to energy prices as described above. These favorable drivers were partially offset by the timing of collections at Masinloc which were negatively impacted by our sell-down of ownership interest in 2014. Fiscal year 2014 versus 2013 Operating margin decrease d $93 million , or 55% , which was driven primarily by the following: Masinloc Lower plant availability $ (33 ) Net decrease from lower spot sales, partially offset by higher volumes (21 ) Philippine market operator's adjustment in the first quarter of 2014 to retrospectively recalculate energy prices related to an unprecedented increase in spot energy prices in November and December 2013 (15 ) Higher maintenance costs (4 ) Other (6 ) Total Masinloc Decrease (79 ) Kelanitissa Impact of the step-down in the contracted PPA price (17 ) Total Kelanitissa Decrease (17 ) Other Business Drivers 3 Total Asia SBU Operating Margin Decrease $ (93 ) 95 Adjusted Operating Margin decreased $108 million due to the drivers above adjusted for the impact of noncontrolling interests and excluding unrealized gains on derivatives.

Adjusted PTC decreased $96 million , driven by the decrease of $108 million in Adjusted Operating Margin described above, partially offset by the impact of lower proportional interest expense at Masinloc and gains on foreign currency. Proportional Free Cash Flow decreased $19 million , which includes the $108 million decrease in Adjusted Operating Margin as described above, excluding the retrospective adjustment to energy prices, partially offset by the timing of collections and payments for coal at Masinloc as well as a decrease in payments for interest and taxes. Key Trends and Uncertainties During 2016 and beyond, we expect to face the following challenges at certain of our businesses. Management expects that improved operating performance at certain businesses, growth from new businesses and global cost reduction initiatives may lessen or offset their impact. If these favorable effects do not occur, or if the challenges described below and elsewhere in this section impact us more significantly than we currently anticipate, or if volatile foreign currencies and commodities move more unfavorably, then these adverse factors (or other adverse factors unknown to us) may impact our operating margin, net income attributable to The AES Corporation and cash flows. We continue to monitor our operations and address challenges as they arise. For the risk factors related to our business, see Item 1. Business and Item 1A. Risk Factors of this Form 10-K. Operational Sensitivity to Dry Hydrological Conditions Our hydroelectric generation facilities are sensitive to changes in the weather, particularly the level of water inflows into generation facilities. Since 2013, dry hydrological conditions in Panama, Brazil, Colombia and Chile have presented challenges for our businesses in these markets. Low rainfall and water inflows have caused reservoir levels to be below historical levels, reduced generation output, and increased prices for electricity. If hydrological conditions do not improve and our hydroelectric generation facilities cannot generate sufficient energy to meet contractual arrangements, we may need to purchase energy to fulfill our obligations, which could have a material adverse impact on our results of operations. According to the National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration ("NOAA") a strong El Ni o has been declared and is forecasted through the spring of 2016. According to local hydrological forecasts in Panama, below historical average inflows are expected to persist through the dry season of 2016 (ending in April). The effects of the El Ni o phenomena could potentially intensify the dry hydrology conditions during this period. AES Panama has to purchase energy on the spot market to fulfill its contract obligations when its generation output is below contract levels. However, with declines in oil prices the cost of purchasing replacement power is reduced. In addition, lower hydrology results in less energy available to sell in the spot market after fulfilling contract obligations. We expect this trend to continue through the dry season of 2016, which will continue to impact our results of operations. The El Ni o brought some relief to the dry conditions in Brazil as it brought rain to the South and Southeast regions. The Southeast region has a significant portion of the country's reservoir capacity. At the beginning of 2016, we expect the system operator in Brazil to continue to pursue a more conservative reservoir management strategy to recover the reservoirs. Higher inflows are expected along with an impact on reservoir level recovery and lower spot prices. AES Sul, which is in the South of Brazil, could be negatively impacted by higher hydrology causing floods and other damage which could disrupt service and require emergency repairs. Additionally, higher hydrology could reduce the need for demand to provide irrigation services during the warm season. Impacts in Colombia are uncertain since it will depend strongly upon the behavior pattern of the El Ni o and can lead to better hydrology for just the area where our plant, Chivor, is located or the country as a whole. More extreme behavior can have an opposite impact and leave the Chivor basin dryer but the remainder of the country with better hydrology. In the case of Chile, the hydrological year starts in April, and given that the El Ni o phenomenon is not highly correlated with hydrological conditions in Chile, projection are made considering the average of all hydrological conditions. For the first quarter 2016, projections are made considering 2015 snowpack information which shows hydrological condition lower than average. The exact behavior pattern and strength of El Ni o cannot be definitively known at this time and therefore the impacts could vary from those described above. Even if rainfall and water inflows return to historical averages, in some cases high market prices and low generation could persist until reservoir levels are fully recovered. Macroeconomic and Political During the past few years, economic conditions in some countries where our subsidiaries conduct business have deteriorated. Global economic conditions remain volatile and could have an adverse impact on our businesses in the event these 96 recent trends continue. Brazil In Brazil, economic conditions remain unfavorable, as indicated by such factors as a negative GDP growth for 2015 and expectation for the same in 2016 and flat for 2017, higher interest rates and inflation, and increasing unemployment. As a consequence, our distribution businesses have experienced a decline in demand. If these economic conditions persist or worsen, there could be a material impact on our businesses and AES's results of operations, particularly in our distribution businesses in Brazil, AES Sul and AES Eletropaulo. In the case of AES Sul, at December 31, 2015, debt in the amount of $333 million is classified as current due to a failure to meet required debt covenants related to earnings for two consecutive quarters. This default is primarily due to the economic conditions noted above, an increase in regulatory assets due to sector charges and higher priced energy purchases, increase in delinquency rates, and higher costs due to unfavorable hydrology in Brazil and severe weather conditions, particularly in AES Sul's service area. AES Sul is in negotiations with its creditors and has obtained a waiver for a period of two months, that ends in February 2016, when the Company expects to close the renegotiation of the whole debt, involving extending the debt maturities and additional equity contributions of approximately $75 million. Following the debt renegotiations, the Company will assess all strategic alternatives for AES Sul. If the negotiation is unsuccessful, we may face a loss of earnings and/or cash flows from Sul and may have to provide loans or equity to support the business, and/or restructure the business, any of which could have a material impact on the Company. In addition, AES Sul has recorded net deferred tax assets ("DTA") of $133 million relating primarily to net operating loss carryforwards, which are not subject to expiration. Realization is dependent on generating sufficient taxable income. Although realization is not assured, management believes it is more likely than not that all of the DTA will be realized. The amount of DTA that is considered realizable, however, could be reduced in the near term if estimates of future taxable income are reduced. Argentina In November 2015, Argentina held presidential elections in which centrist candidate Mauricio Macri was elected president. During his campaign, Mauricio Macri emphasized that energy would be a key factor in the government's agenda and that a long-term state policy would be required to address the country's energy crisis. Also, the elected President signed, together with the opposition candidates, a statement of commitment addressed to the previous administration, that included several guidelines to reactivate the sector including the implementation of a strategic long-term energy plan, that a fair and reasonable customer tariffs be set for generation, transport and distribution costs, as well as reductions in subsidies and the introduction of a social tariff. In line with these statements, the Energy and Mining Minister published Resolution 6/2016 and 7/2016 in January 2016 that outlines planned increases to the end consumers of energy that will be effective starting on February 1, 2016. These resolutions contemplate an increase in tariffs of up to 300% for energy pass-through, grant Distribution Value Added ("DVA") increases for Distribution Companies, provide a regulatory framework for an Integral Tariff Review and introduce subsidies for low income consumers. These increases are intended to lessen the burden on the government to subsidize the energy industry. In 2001, Argentina defaulted on its public debt, when it stopped making payments of approximately $100 billion of debt amid a deep economic crisis. In 2005 and 2010, Argentina restructured its defaulted bonds into new securities valued at about 33 cents on the dollar. Between the two transactions, 93% of the bondholders agreed to exchange their defaulted bonds for new bonds. The remaining 7% did not accept the restructured deal. Since then, a certain group of the "hold-out" bondholders have been in judicial proceedings with Argentina regarding payment and the U.S. District Court ruled that Argentina would need to make payments to such hold-out bondholders according to the original applicable terms. Despite intense negotiations with the hold-out bondholders through the U.S. District Court appointed Special Master, on July 30, 2014 the parties failed to reach a settlement agreement and consequently (as referred by S&P and Fitch ratings) Argentina fell into a selective default resulting from failure to make interest payments on its Discount Bonds maturing in December 2033. The new administration started conversations to negotiate a solution with the bondholders which could resolve this situation and let Argentina return to the credit markets in the near future. Although this situation remains unresolved, it has not caused any significant changes that impact our current exposures, and the long-term receivables in Argentina for the plants that commenced commercial operations in 2010 are being actively collected. For further information, see Note 7 Financing Receivables in Item 8. Financial Statements and Supplementary Data of the 2015 Form 10-K. Bulgaria Our investments in Bulgaria rely on long-term PPAs with NEK, the state-owned electricity public supplier and energy trading company. NEK is facing some liquidity issues and has been delayed in making payments under the PPAs with Maritza and St. Nikola. In August 2015, the ninth amendment of Maritza's PPA was executed under which Maritza and NEK would reduce the capacity payment to Maritza under the PPA by 14% through the PPA Term, without impacting the energy price component. In exchange, NEK would pay Maritza its overdue receivables. The amendment will become effective upon full payment of the overdue receivables by NEK, which is expected in 2016. For the period October through December 2015, NEK paid a total of $64 million, which is $16 million more than payments received in the previous year. As of December 31, 2015, Maritza's total outstanding receivables were $351 million , of which $44 million were current and $307 million were overdue. Total receivables increased by $89 million from $262 million in December 31, 2014. See additional background within Part I. Item 1 Business Our Organization and Segments Europe Bulgaria Regulatory Framework. 97 As of June 30, 2015, we concluded that the HTA signed with NEK in April is considered an indicator of an impairment of the long-lived assets in Bulgaria for Maritza. Therefore, a test of recoverability was performed and management believes the carrying amount of the asset groups was recoverable as of June 30, 2015. Management does not believe that an indicator of an impairment existed as of December 31, 2015. As of December 31, 2015, Maritza had long-lived assets of $1.2 billion and total debt of $559 million . Long-lived assets for St. Nikola were $210 million and total debt of $140 million . Unless and until a complete and binding resolution is in place, there remains a risk that we may still face a loss of earnings and/or cash flows from the affected businesses (or be unable to exercise remedies for a breach of the PPA) and may have to provide loans or equity to support affected businesses or projects, restructure them, write down their value and/or face the possibility that these projects cannot continue operations or provide returns consistent with our expectations, any of which could have a material impact on the Company. Puerto Rico Our subsidiaries in Puerto Rico have long term PPAs with PREPA, a state-owned entity. Due to the ongoing economic situation in the country, PREPA faces significant financial challenges. On June 28, 2014, the Puerto Rico Public Corporation Debt Enforcement and Recovery Act (the "Recovery Act") was signed into law, which allows public corporations, including PREPA, to adjust their debts. As a result of this event, on July 6, 2014, PREPA entered into a Forbearance Agreement with its lenders in order to permit an opportunity for negotiation of a possible financial restructuring of PREPA. In February 2015, the negotiating position of PREPA was weakened when the federal court deemed the Recovery Act unconstitutional. Despite this setback, PREPA managed to extend the expiration of the Forbearance Agreement several times, achieving in December of 2015 certain preliminary restructuring agreements, called Restructuring Support Agreements ("RSAs"), with most of the bondholders and bank lenders, which involved reductions of capital and interest rates and options to either convert existing credits to term loans or to exchange their principal for new securitized bonds. The RSA is conditional to a series of future related milestones, the more important being the passing of a bill that would allow an increase in tariffs. There has been no adverse impacts to AES Puerto Rico due to PREPA's financial challenges. AES Puerto Rico's receivables balance as of December 31, 2015 is $65 million , of which $21 million was overdue. Subsequent to December 31, 2015 , the full overdue amount has been collected. If the situation declines, there could be a material impact on the Company. Macroeconomic and Political Conclusion If economic conditions deteriorate further, it could affect the prices we receive for the electricity we generate or transmit. Utility regulators or parties to our generation contracts may seek to lower our prices based on prevailing market conditions pursuant to PPAs, concession agreements or other contracts as they come up for renewal or reset. In addition, rising fuel and other costs coupled with contractual price or tariff decreases could restrict our ability to operate profitably in a given market. Each of these factors, as well as those discussed above, could result in a decline in the value of our assets including those at the businesses we operate, our equity investments and projects under development and could result in asset impairments that could be material to our operations. We continue to monitor our projects and businesses. Foreign Exchange and Commodities Our businesses are exposed to and proactively manage market risk. Our primary market risk exposure is to the price of commodities, particularly electricity, oil, natural gas, coal and environmental credits. In 2015, there were more than 40% declines in oil and natural gas prices, which have an impact on our businesses in the Dominican Republic, Ohio and Northern Ireland. Since we operate in multiple countries and as such are subject to volatility in exchange rates at varying degrees at the subsidiary level and between our functional currency, the U.S. Dollar, and currencies of the countries in which we operate. In 2015, we had significant devaluations in the Argentine Peso, Brazilian Real, Colombian Peso, and Kazakhstan Tenge, which had a significant impact on our 2015 results. In 2016, our results could be materially impacted if the U.S. Dollar continues to appreciate. For additional information, refer to Item 7A. Quantitative and Qualitative Disclosures About Market Risk. Impairments Long-lived Assets During the year ended December 31, 2015 , the Company recognized asset impairments of $285 million . See Note 21 Asset Impairment Expense in this Form 10-K for further information. Additionally, in the third quarter of 2015, the Company tested the recoverability of its long-lived assets at Ballylumford in Northern Ireland and Buffalo Gap I and II. Impairment indicators were identified at Ballylumford, primarily based on an unfavorable capacity reduction proposed by the Utility regulator in Northern Ireland, and at Buffalo Gap, based on a decline in forward power curves coupled with the near term expiration of favorable contracted cash flows. As of September 30, 2015, the Company determined that the carrying amount of the long-lived asset groups at Ballylumford and Buffalo Gap I and II, which totaled $92 million and $371 million, respectively, were recoverable, and no impairment expense was recognized. Buffalo Gap 98 I and II have PPAs that will expire at the end of 2021 and 2017, respectively. Once the PPAs expire, the entire installed capacity of Buffalo Gap will be exposed to the volatility of energy prices in the ERCOT market which could adversely affect revenues. No impairment indicators were identified in the fourth quarter of 2015. Events or changes in circumstances that may necessitate further recoverability tests and potential impairments of long-lived assets may include, but are not limited to, adverse changes in the regulatory environment, unfavorable changes in power prices or fuel costs, increased competition due to additional capacity in the grid, technological advancements, declining trends in demand, or an expectation that it is more likely than not that the asset will be disposed of before the end of its previously estimated useful life. Goodwill During 2015 , the Company recognized total goodwill impairment expense of $317 million , which resulted from the annual goodwill impairment test performed in the fourth quarter of 2015 at its DP&L reporting unit ("DP&L"). As of December 31, 2015 , there was no remaining goodwill balance at DP&L. See Note 10 Goodwill and Other Intangible Assets in Item 8. Financial Statements and Supplementary Data for further information. The Company currently has no reporting units considered to be "at risk." A reporting unit is considered "at risk" when its fair value is not higher than its carrying amount by more than 10%. The Company monitors its reporting units at risk of Step 1 failure on an ongoing basis. It is possible that the Company may incur goodwill impairment charges at any reporting units containing goodwill in future periods if adverse changes in their business or operating environments occur. Capital Resources and Liquidity Overview As of December 31, 2015 , the Company had unrestricted cash and cash equivalents of $1.3 billion , of which $400 million was held at the Parent Company and qualified holding companies. The Company also had $484 million in short term investments, held primarily at subsidiaries. In addition, we had restricted cash and debt service reserves of $860 million . The Company also had non-recourse and recourse aggregate principal amounts of debt outstanding of $15.8 billion and $5.0 billion , respectively. Of the approximately $2.5 billion of our current non-recourse debt, $1.5 billion was presented as such because it is due in the next twelve months and $1.0 billion relates to debt considered in default due to covenant violations. The defaults are not payment defaults, but are instead technical defaults triggered by failure to comply with other covenants and/or other conditions such as (but not limited to) failure to meet information covenants, complete construction or other milestones in an allocated time, meet certain minimum or maximum financial ratios, or other requirements contained in the non-recourse debt documents of the Company. We expect such current maturities will be repaid from net cash provided by operating activities of the subsidiary to which the debt relates or through opportunistic refinancing activity or some combination thereof. None of our recourse debt matures within the next twelve months. From time to time, we may elect to repurchase our outstanding debt through cash purchases, privately negotiated transactions or otherwise when management believes that such securities are attractively priced. Such repurchases, if any, will depend on prevailing market conditions, our liquidity requirements and other factors. The amounts involved in any such repurchases may be material. We rely mainly on long-term debt obligations to fund our construction activities. We have, to the extent available at acceptable terms, utilized non-recourse debt to fund a significant portion of the capital expenditures and investments required to construct and acquire our electric power plants, distribution companies and related assets. Our non-recourse financing is designed to limit cross default risk to the Parent Company or other subsidiaries and affiliates. Our non-recourse long-term debt is a combination of fixed and variable interest rate instruments. Generally, a portion or all of the variable rate debt is fixed through the use of interest rate swaps. In addition, the debt is typically denominated in the currency that matches the currency of the revenue expected to be generated from the benefiting project, thereby reducing currency risk. In certain cases, the currency is matched through the use of derivative instruments. The majority of our non-recourse debt is funded by international commercial banks, with debt capacity supplemented by multilaterals and local regional banks. Given our long-term debt obligations, the Company is subject to interest rate risk on debt balances that accrue interest at variable rates. When possible, the Company will borrow funds at fixed interest rates or hedge its variable rate debt to fix its interest costs on such obligations. In addition, the Company has historically tried to maintain at least 70% of its consolidated long-term obligations at fixed interest rates, including fixing the interest rate through the use of interest rate swaps. These efforts apply to the notional amount of the swaps compared to the amount of related underlying debt. Presently, the Parent Company's only material un-hedged exposure to variable interest rate debt relates to indebtedness under its senior secured credit facility and floating rate senior unsecured notes due 2019. On a consolidated basis, of the Company's $15.8 billion of total non-recourse debt outstanding as of December 31, 2015 , approximately $3.8 billion bore interest at variable rates that were not subject to a derivative instrument which fixed the interest rate. In addition to utilizing non-recourse debt at a subsidiary level when available, the Parent Company provides a portion, or in certain instances all, of the remaining long-term financing or credit required to fund development, construction or acquisition of a particular project. These investments have generally taken the form of equity investments or intercompany loans, which are subordinated to the project's non-recourse loans. We generally obtain the funds for these investments from our cash flows from operations, proceeds from the sales of assets and/or the proceeds from our issuances of debt, common stock and other securities. Similarly, in certain of our businesses, the Parent Company may provide financial guarantees or other credit support for the benefit of counterparties who have entered into contracts for the purchase or sale of electricity, equipment or other services with our subsidiaries or lenders. In such circumstances, if a business defaults on its payment or supply obligation, the Parent Company will be responsible for the business' obligations up to the amount provided for in the relevant guarantee or other credit support. At December 31, 2015 , the Parent Company had provided outstanding financial and performance-related guarantees or other credit support commitments to or for the benefit of our businesses, which were limited by the terms of the agreements, of approximately $396 million in aggregate (excluding those collateralized by letters of credit and other obligations discussed below). As a result of the Parent Company's below investment grade rating, counterparties may be unwilling to accept our general unsecured commitments to provide credit support. Accordingly, with respect to both new and existing commitments, the Parent Company may be required to provide some other form of assurance, such as a letter of credit, to backstop or replace our credit support. The Parent Company may not be able to provide adequate assurances to such counterparties. To the extent we are required and able to provide letters of credit or other collateral to such counterparties, this will reduce the amount of credit available to us to meet our other liquidity needs. At December 31, 2015 , we had $62 million in letters of credit outstanding, provided under our senior secured credit facility, and $32 million in cash collateralized letters of credit outstanding outside of 99 our senior secured credit facility. These letters of credit operate to guarantee performance relating to certain project development activities and business operations. During the year ended December 31, 2015 , the Company paid letter of credit fees ranging from 0.2% to 2.5% per annum on the outstanding amounts. We expect to continue to seek, where possible, non-recourse debt financing in connection with the assets or businesses that we or our affiliates may develop, construct or acquire. However, depending on local and global market conditions and the unique characteristics of individual businesses, non-recourse debt may not be available on economically attractive terms or at all. If we decide not to provide any additional funding or credit support to a subsidiary project that is under construction or has near-term debt payment obligations and that subsidiary is unable to obtain additional non-recourse debt, such subsidiary may become insolvent, and we may lose our investment in that subsidiary. Additionally, if any of our subsidiaries lose a significant customer, the subsidiary may need to withdraw from a project or restructure the non-recourse debt financing. If we or the subsidiary choose not to proceed with a project or are unable to successfully complete a restructuring of the non-recourse debt, we may lose our investment in that subsidiary. Many of our subsidiaries depend on timely and continued access to capital markets to manage their liquidity needs. The inability to raise capital on favorable terms, to refinance existing indebtedness or to fund operations and other commitments during times of political or economic uncertainty may have material adverse effects on the financial condition and results of operations of those subsidiaries. In addition, changes in the timing of tariff increases or delays in the regulatory determinations under the relevant concessions could affect the cash flows and results of operations of our businesses. Long-Term Receivables As of December 31, 2015 , the Company had approximately $296 million and $63 million of accounts receivable classified as Noncurrent assets other and Current assets Accounts receivable , respectively, related to certain of its generation businesses in Argentina and the U.S. and its utility businesses in Brazil. The noncurrent portion primarily consists of accounts receivable in Argentina that, pursuant to amended agreements or government resolutions, have collection periods that extend beyond December 31, 2016 , or one year from the latest balance sheet date. The majority of Argentinian receivables have been converted into long-term financing for the construction of power plants. See Note 7 Financing Receivables included in Item 8.

The proportionate share of cash flows and related adjustments attributable to noncontrolling interests in our subsidiaries comprise the proportional adjustment factor presented in the reconciliation below. Upon the Company's adoption of the accounting guidance for service concession arrangements effective January 1, 2015, capital expenditures related to service concession assets that would have been classified as investing activities on the Consolidated Statement of Cash Flows are now classified as operating activities. See Note 1 General and Summary of Significant Accounting Policies of this Form 10-K for further information on the adoption of this guidance. Beginning in the quarter ended March 31, 2015, the Company changed the definition of Proportional Free Cash Flow to exclude the cash flows for capital expenditures related to service concession assets that are now classified within net cash provided by operating activities on the Consolidated Statement of Cash Flows. The proportional adjustment factor for these capital expenditures is presented in the reconciliation below. We also exclude environmental capital expenditures that are expected to be recovered through regulatory, contractual or other mechanisms. An example of recoverable environmental capital expenditures is IPL's investment in MATS-related environmental upgrades that are recovered through a tracker. See Item 1. US SBU IPL Environmental Matters for details of these investments. The GAAP measure most comparable to proportional free cash flow is cash flows from operating activities. We believe that proportional free cash flow better reflects the underlying business performance of the Company, as it measures the cash generated by the business, after the funding of maintenance capital expenditures, that may be available for investing or repaying debt or other purposes. Factors in this determination include the impact of noncontrolling interests, where AES consolidates the results of a subsidiary that is not wholly-owned by the Company. The presentation of free cash flow has material limitations. Proportional free cash flow should not be construed as an alternative to cash from operating activities, which is determined in accordance with GAAP. Proportional free cash flow does not represent our cash flow available for discretionary payments because it excludes certain payments that are required or to which we have committed, such as debt service requirements and dividend payments. Our definition of proportional free cash flow may not be comparable to similarly titled measures presented by other companies. Calculation of Proportional Free Cash Flow (in millions) 2015 2014 2013 2015/2014 Change 2014/2013 Change Net Cash Provided by Operating Activities $ 2,134 $ 1,791 $ 2,715 $ 343 $ (924 ) Add: capital expenditures related to service concession assets (1) 165 165 Adjusted Operating Cash Flow 2,299 1,791 2,715 508 (924 ) Less: proportional adjustment factor on operating cash activities (2) (3) (558 ) (359 ) (834 ) (199 ) 475 Proportional Adjusted Operating Cash Flow 1,741 1,432 1,881 309 (449 ) Less: proportional maintenance capital expenditures, net of reinsurance proceeds (2) (449 ) (485 ) (535 ) 36 50 Less: proportional non-recoverable environmental capital expenditures (2) (4) (51 ) (56 ) (75 ) 5 19 Proportional Free Cash Flow $ 1,241 $ 891 $ 1,271 $ 350 $ (380 ) (1) Service concession asset expenditures excluded from proportional free cash flow non-GAAP metric. (2) The proportional adjustment factor, proportional maintenance capital expenditures (net of reinsurance proceeds) and proportional non-recoverable environmental capital expenditures are calculated by multiplying the percentage owned by noncontrolling interests for each entity by its corresponding consolidated cash flow metric and are totaled to the resulting figures. For example, Parent Company A owns 20% of Subsidiary Company B, a consolidated subsidiary. Thus, Subsidiary Company B has an 80% noncontrolling interest. Assuming a consolidated net cash flow from operating activities of $100 from Subsidiary B, the proportional adjustment factor for Subsidiary B would equal $80 (or $100 x 80%). The Company calculates the proportional adjustment factor for each consolidated business in this manner and then sums these amounts to determine the total proportional adjustment factor used in the reconciliation. The proportional adjustment factor may differ from the proportion of income attributable to noncontrolling interests as a result of (a) non-cash items which impact income but not cash and (b) AES' ownership interest in the subsidiary where such items occur. (3) Includes proportional adjustment amount for service concession asset expenditures of $84 million for the year ended December 31, 2015 . The Company adopted service concession accounting effective January 1, 2015. (4) Excludes IPL's proportional recoverable environmental capital expenditures of $205 million , $163 million and $110 million for the years December 31, 2015 , 2014 and 2013 , respectively. 104 Operating Cash Flow and Proportional Free Cash Flow Analysis (1) Operating Cash Flow by SBU Proportional Free Cash Flow by SBU 2015 2014 2013 2015/2014 Change 2014/2013 Change 2015 2014 2013 2015/2014 Change 2014/2013 Change US $ 845 $ 830 $ 924 $ 15 $ (94 ) $ 591 $ 646 $ 689 $ (55 ) $ (43 ) Andes 462 359 373 103 (14 ) 224 176 188 48 (12 ) Brazil 136 316 866 (180 ) (550 ) (29 ) 13 116 (42 ) (103 ) MCAC 705 370 550 335 (180 ) 498 281 433 217 (152 ) Europe 339 292 486 47 (194 ) 238 197 345 41 (148 ) Asia 15 105 111 (90 ) (6 ) 87 82 101 5 (19 ) Corporate (368 ) (481 ) (595 ) 113 114 (368 ) (504 ) (601 ) 136 97 Total SBUs $ 2,134 $ 1,791 $ 2,715 $ 343 $ (924 ) $ 1,241 $ 891 $ 1,271 $ 350 $ (380 ) (1) Operating cash flow and proportional free cash flow as presented above include the effect of intercompany transactions with other segments except for interest, tax sharing, charges for management fees and transfer pricing.

Parent Free Cash Flow (a non-GAAP measure) The Company defines Parent Free Cash Flow as dividends and other distributions received from our operating businesses less certain cash costs at the Parent Company level, primarily interest payments, overhead, and development costs. Parent Free Cash Flow is used to fund shareholder dividends, share repurchases, growth investments, recourse debt repayments, and other uses by the Parent Company. Refer to Item 1 Business Overview for further discussion of the Parent Company's capital allocation strategy. Parent Company Liquidity The following discussion of Parent Company Liquidity has been included because we believe it is a useful measure of the liquidity available to The AES Corporation, or the Parent Company, given the non-recourse nature of most of our indebtedness. Parent Company Liquidity as outlined below is a non-GAAP measure and should not be construed as an alternative to cash and cash equivalents which are determined in accordance with GAAP, as a measure of liquidity. Cash and cash equivalents are disclosed in the consolidated statements of cash flows. Parent Company Liquidity may differ from similarly titled measures used by other companies. The principal sources of liquidity at the Parent Company level are dividends and other distributions from our subsidiaries, including refinancing proceeds; proceeds from debt and equity financings at the Parent Company level, including availability under our credit facility; and proceeds from asset sales. Cash requirements at the Parent Company level are primarily to fund interest; principal repayments of debt; construction commitments; other equity commitments; common stock repurchases; acquisitions; taxes; Parent Company overhead and development costs; and dividends on common stock. 110 The Company defines Parent Company Liquidity as cash available to the Parent Company plus available borrowings under existing credit facility. The cash held at qualified holding companies represents cash sent to subsidiaries of the Company domiciled outside of the U.S.. Such subsidiaries have no contractual restrictions on their ability to send cash to the Parent Company. Parent Company Liquidity is reconciled to its most directly comparable U.S. GAAP financial measure, Cash and cash equivalents , at December 31, 2015 and 2014 as follows: Parent Company Liquidity (in millions) 2015 2014 Consolidated cash and cash equivalents $ 1,262 $ 1,539 Less: Cash and cash equivalents at subsidiaries 862 1,032 Parent and qualified holding companies' cash and cash equivalents 400 507 Commitments under Parent credit facility 800 800 Less: Letters of credit under the credit facilities (62 ) (61 ) Borrowings available under Parent credit facilities 738 739 Total Parent Company Liquidity $ 1,138 $ 1,246 The Company paid dividends of $0.40 per share to its common stockholders during the year ended December 31, 2015 . While we intend to continue payment of dividends and believe we will have sufficient liquidity to do so, we can provide no assurance that we will continue to pay dividends, or if continued, the amount of such dividends. Recourse Debt Our recourse debt at year-end was approximately $5.0 billion and $5.3 billion in 2015 and 2014 , respectively. See Note 12 Debt in Item 8. Financial Statements and Supplementary Data of this Form 10-K for additional detail. While we believe that our sources of liquidity will be adequate to meet our needs for the foreseeable future, this belief is based on a number of material assumptions, including, without limitation, assumptions about our ability to access the capital markets (see Key Trends and Uncertainties Global Economic Conditions ), the operating and financial performance of our subsidiaries, currency exchange rates, power market pool prices, and the ability of our subsidiaries to pay dividends. In addition, our subsidiaries' ability to declare and pay cash dividends to us (at the Parent Company level) is subject to certain limitations contained in loans, governmental provisions and other agreements. We can provide no assurance that these sources will be available when needed or that the actual cash requirements will not be greater than anticipated. See Item 1A. Risk Factors The AES Corporation is a holding company and its ability to make payments on its outstanding indebtedness, including its public debt securities, is dependent upon the receipt of funds from its subsidiaries by way of dividends, fees, interest, loans or otherwise, of this Form 10-K. Various debt instruments at the Parent Company level, including our senior secured credit facility, contain certain restrictive covenants. The covenants provide for among other items limitations on other indebtedness, liens, investments and guarantees; limitations on dividends, stock repurchases and other equity transactions; restrictions and limitations on mergers and acquisitions, sales of assets, leases, transactions with affiliates and off-balance sheet and derivative arrangements; maintenance of certain financial ratios; and financial and other reporting requirements. As of December 31, 2015 , we were in compliance with these covenants at the Parent Company level. Non-Recourse Debt While the lenders under our non-recourse debt financings generally do not have direct recourse to the Parent Company, defaults thereunder can still have important consequences for our results of operations and liquidity, including, without limitation: reducing our cash flows as the subsidiary will typically be prohibited from distributing cash to the Parent Company during the time period of any default; triggering our obligation to make payments under any financial guarantee, letter of credit or other credit support we have provided to or on behalf of such subsidiary; causing us to record a loss in the event the lender forecloses on the assets; and triggering defaults in our outstanding debt at the Parent Company. For example, our senior secured credit facility and outstanding debt securities at the Parent Company include events of default for certain bankruptcy related events involving material subsidiaries. In addition, our revolving credit agreement at the Parent Company includes events of default related to payment defaults and accelerations of outstanding debt of material subsidiaries. Some of our subsidiaries are currently in default with respect to all or a portion of their outstanding indebtedness. The total non-recourse debt classified as current in the accompanying Consolidated Balance Sheets amounts to $2.5 billion . The portion of current debt related to such defaults was $1.0 billion at December 31, 2015 , all of which was non-recourse debt related to four subsidiaries Maritza, Sul, Kavarna, and Sogrinsk. See Note 12 Debt in Item 8. Financial Statements and Supplementary Data of this Form 10-K for additional detail. None of the subsidiaries that are currently in default are subsidiaries that met the applicable definition of materiality under AES' corporate debt agreements as of December 31, 2015 in order for such defaults to trigger an event of default or permit acceleration under AES' indebtedness. However, as a result of additional dispositions of assets, other significant reductions in asset carrying values or other matters in the future that may impact our financial position and results of operations or the financial position of the individual subsidiary, it is possible that one or more of these subsidiaries could fall within the definition of a "material subsidiary" and thereby upon an acceleration trigger an event of default and possible acceleration of the indebtedness under the Parent Company's outstanding debt securities. A material subsidiary is defined in the Company's senior secured revolving credit facility as any business that contributed 20% or more of the Parent Company's total cash distributions from businesses for the four most recently completed fiscal quarters. As of December 31, 2015 , none of the defaults listed above individually or in the aggregate results in or is at risk of triggering a cross-default under the recourse debt of the Company. 111 Contractual Obligations and Parent Company Contingent Contractual Obligations A summary of our contractual obligations, commitments and other liabilities as of December 31, 2015 is presented in the table below, which excludes any businesses classified as discontinued operations or held-for-sale (in millions): Contractual Obligations Total Less than 1 year 1-3 years 3-5 years More than 5 years Other Footnote Reference (5) Debt Obligations (1) $ 20,807 $ 2,529 $ 2,562 $ 3,624 $ 12,092 $ 12 Interest Payments on Long-Term Debt (2) 7,897 1,233 2,131 1,552 2,981 n/a Capital Lease Obligations (3) 147 14 23 20 90 13 Operating Lease Obligations (3) 1,291 77 157 159 898 13 Electricity Obligations (3) 37,594 2,623 5,078 5,717 24,176 13 Fuel Obligations (3) 5,253 1,120 1,367 625 2,141 13 Other Purchase Obligations (3) 9,383 1,332 2,128 1,528 4,395 13 Other Long-Term Liabilities Reflected on AES' Consolidated Balance Sheet under GAAP (4) 696 220 35 406 35 n/a Total $ 83,068 $ 8,928 $ 13,666 $ 13,260 $ 47,179 $ 35 (1) Includes recourse and non-recourse debt presented on the Consolidated Balance Sheet. See Note 12 Debt to the Consolidated Financial Statements included in Item 8 Financial Statements and Supplementary Data of this Form 10-K which provides additional disclosure regarding these obligations. These amounts exclude capital lease obligations which are included in the capital lease category, see (3) below. (2) Interest payments are estimated based on final maturity dates of debt securities outstanding at December 31, 2015 and do not reflect anticipated future refinancing, early redemptions or new debt issuances. Variable rate interest obligations are estimated based on rates as of December 31, 2015 . (3) See Note 13 Commitments to the Consolidated Financial Statements included in Item 8 of this Form 10-K for further information. (4) These amounts do not include current liabilities on the Consolidated Balance Sheet except for the current portion of uncertain tax obligations. Noncurrent uncertain tax obligations are reflected in the "Other" column of the table above as the Company is not able to reasonably estimate the timing of the future payments. In addition, the amounts do not include: (1) regulatory liabilities (See Note 11 Regulatory Assets and Liabilities ), (2) contingencies (See Note 14 Contingencies ), (3) pension and other post retirement employee benefit liabilities (see Note 15 Benefit Plans ) or (4) any taxes (See Note 22 Income Taxes ) except for uncertain tax obligations, as the Company is not able to reasonably estimate the timing of future payments. See the indicated notes to the Consolidated Financial Statements included in Item 8 of this Form 10-K for additional information on the items excluded. Derivatives (See Note 6 Derivative Instruments and Hedging Activities ) and incentive compensation are excluded as the Company is not able to reasonably estimate the timing or amount of the future payments. (5) For further information see the note referenced below in Item 8. Financial Statements and Supplementary Data of this Form 10-K. The following table presents our Parent Company's contingent contractual obligations as of December 31, 2015 : Contingent contractual obligations ($ in millions) Amount Number of Agreements Maximum Exposure Range for Each Agreement Guarantees and commitments $ 369 14 $1 - 53 Asset sale related indemnities (1) 27 1 27 Cash collateralized letters of credit 32 4 $1 - 15 Letters of credit under the senior secured credit facility 62 7 <$1 - 29 Total $ 490 26 (1) Excludes normal and customary representations and warranties in agreements for the sale of assets (including ownership in associated legal entities) where the associated risk is considered to be nominal. As of December 31, 2015 , the Company had no commitments to invest in subsidiaries under construction and to purchase related equipment that were not included in the letters of credit disclosed above. We have a diverse portfolio of performance-related contingent contractual obligations. These obligations are designed to cover potential risks and only require payment if certain targets are not met or certain contingencies occur. The risks associated with these obligations include change of control, construction cost overruns, subsidiary default, political risk, tax indemnities, spot market power prices, sponsor support and liquidated damages under power sales agreements for projects in development, in operation and under construction. In addition, we have an asset sale program through which we may have customary indemnity obligations under certain assets sale agreements. While we do not expect that we will be required to fund any material amounts under these contingent contractual obligations beyond 2015 , many of the events which would give rise to such obligations are beyond our control. We can provide no assurance that we will be able to fund our obligations under these contingent contractual obligations if we are required to make substantial payments thereunder. 112 Critical Accounting Policies and Estimates The Consolidated Financial Statements of AES are prepared in conformity with U.S. GAAP, which requires the use of estimates, judgments and assumptions that affect the reported amounts of assets and liabilities at the date of the financial statements and the reported amounts of revenue and expenses during the periods presented. AES' significant accounting policies are described in Note 1 General and Summary of Significant Accounting Policies to the Consolidated Financial Statements included in Item 8 of this Form 10-K. An accounting estimate is considered critical if the estimate requires management to make assumptions about matters that were highly uncertain at the time the estimate was made; different estimates reasonably could have been used; or the impact of the estimates and assumptions on financial condition or operating performance is material. Management believes that the accounting estimates employed are appropriate and the resulting balances are reasonable; however, actual results could materially differ from the original estimates, requiring adjustments to these balances in future periods. Management has discussed these critical accounting policies with the Audit Committee, as appropriate. Listed below are the Company's most significant critical accounting estimates and assumptions used in the preparation of the Consolidated Financial Statements. Income Taxes We are subject to income taxes in both the U.S. and numerous foreign jurisdictions. Our worldwide income tax provision requires significant judgment and is based on calculations and assumptions that are subject to examination by the Internal Revenue Service and other taxing authorities. The Company and certain of its subsidiaries are under examination by relevant taxing authorities for various tax years. The Company regularly assesses the potential outcome of these examinations in each tax jurisdiction when determining the adequacy of the provision for income taxes. Accounting guidance for uncertainty in income taxes prescribes a more likely than not recognition threshold. Tax reserves have been established, which the Company believes to be adequate in relation to the potential for additional assessments. Once established, reserves are adjusted only when there is more information available or when an event occurs necessitating a change to the reserves. While the Company believes that the amounts of the tax estimates are reasonable, it is possible that the ultimate outcome of current or future examinations may be materially different than the reserve amounts. Because we have a wide range of statutory tax rates in the multiple jurisdictions in which we operate, any changes in our geographical earnings mix could materially impact our effective tax rate. Furthermore, our tax position could be adversely impacted by changes in tax laws, tax treaties or tax regulations or the interpretation or enforcement thereof and such changes may be more likely or become more likely in view of recent economic trends in certain of the jurisdictions in which we operate. As an example, new tax laws were enacted in February 2016 in Chile which will increase the statutory income tax rate for most of our Chilean businesses from 25% to 25.5% in 2017 and to 27% for 2018 and future years. Accordingly, in 2016 our net Chilean deferred tax liabilities will be remeasured to the new rates. The remeasurement amount and other potential future impacts of the changes in tax law may be material to continuing operations. The Company's provision for income taxes could be adversely impacted by changes to the U.S. taxation of earnings of our foreign subsidiaries. Since 2006, the Company has benefited from the Controlled Foreign Corporation look-through rule, originally enacted in the TIPRA of 2005, subject to five temporary extensions, including the most recent five year retroactive extension enacted on December 18, 2015 in the H.R.2029 - Consolidated Appropriations Act, 2016. There can be no assurance that this provision will continue to be extended beyond December 31, 2019. Further, the U.S. is considering corporate tax reform that may significantly change the U.S. international tax rules and corporate tax rates. Our expected effective tax rate could increase by amounts that may be material to the Company should such reforms be enacted. In addition, U.S. income taxes and foreign withholding taxes have not been provided on undistributed earnings for certain of our non-U.S. subsidiaries to the extent such earnings are considered to be indefinitely reinvested in the operations of those subsidiaries. Deferred tax assets and liabilities are recognized for the future tax consequences attributable to differences between the financial statement carrying amounts of the existing assets and liabilities, and their respective income tax bases. The Company establishes a valuation allowance when it is more likely than not that all or a portion of a deferred tax asset will not be realized. Sales of Noncontrolling Interests The accounting for a sale of noncontrolling interests under the accounting standards depends on whether the sale is considered to be a sale of in-substance real estate (as opposed to an equity transaction), where the gain (loss) on sale would be recognized in earnings rather than within stockholders' equity. If management's estimation process determines that there is no significant value beyond the in-substance real estate, the gain (loss) on the sale of the noncontrolling interest is recognized in earnings. However, if it is determined that significant value likely exists beyond the in-substance real estate, the gain (loss) on the sale of the noncontrolling interest would be recognized within stockholders' equity. In-substance real estate is comprised of land plus improvements and integral equipment. The determination of whether property, plant and equipment is integral equipment is based on the significance of the costs to remove the equipment from its existing location (including the cost of repairing damage resulting from the removal), combined with the decrease in the fair 113 value of the equipment as a result of those removal activities. When the combined total of removal costs and the decrease in fair value of the equipment exceeds 10% of the fair value of the equipment, the equipment is considered integral equipment. The accounting standards specifically identify power plants as an example of in-substance real estate. Where the consolidated entity in which noncontrolling interests have been sold contains in-substance real estate, management estimates the extent to which the total fair value of the assets of the entity is represented by the in-substance real estate and whether significant value exists beyond the in-substance real estate. This estimation considers all qualitative and quantitative factors relevant for each sale and, where appropriate, includes making quantitative estimates about the fair value of the entity and its identifiable assets and liabilities (including any favorable or unfavorable contracts) by analogy to the accounting standards on business combinations. As such, these estimates may require significant judgment and assumptions, similar to the critical accounting estimates discussed below for impairments and fair value. Impairments Our accounting policies on goodwill and long-lived assets are described in detail in Note 1 General and Summary of Significant Accounting Policies , included in Item 8 of this Form 10-K. The Company makes considerable judgments in its impairment evaluations of goodwill and long-lived assets; however, the fair value determination is typically the most judgmental part in an impairment evaluation. The Company determines the fair value of a reporting unit or a long-lived asset (asset group) by applying the approaches prescribed under the fair value measurement accounting framework. Generally, the market approach and income approach are most relevant in the fair value measurement of our reporting units and long-lived assets; however, due to the lack of available relevant observable market information in many circumstances, the Company often relies on the income approach. The Company may engage an independent valuation firm to assist management with the valuation. The decision to engage an independent valuation firm considers all relevant facts and circumstances, including a cost-benefit analysis and the Company's internal valuation knowledge of the long-lived asset (asset group) or business. The Company develops the underlying assumptions consistent with its internal budgets and forecasts for such valuations. Additionally, the Company uses an internal discounted cash flow valuation model (the "DCF model"), based on the principles of present value techniques, to estimate the fair value of its reporting units or long-lived assets under the income approach. The DCF model estimates fair value by discounting our internal budgets and cash flow forecasts, adjusted to reflect market participant assumptions, to the extent necessary, at an appropriate discount rate. Management applies considerable judgment in selecting several input assumptions during the development of our internal budgets and cash flow forecasts. Examples of the input assumptions that our budgets and forecasts are sensitive to include macroeconomic factors such as growth rates, industry demand, inflation, exchange rates, power prices and commodity prices. Whenever appropriate, management obtains these input assumptions from observable market data sources (e.g., Economic Intelligence Unit) and extrapolates the market information if an input assumption is not observable for the entire forecast period. Many of these input assumptions are dependent on other economic assumptions, which are often derived from statistical economic models with inherent limitations such as estimation differences. Further, several input assumptions are based on historical trends which often do not recur. The input assumptions most significant to our budgets and cash flows are based on expectations of macroeconomic factors which have been volatile recently. It is not uncommon that different market data sources have different views of the macroeconomic factor expectations and related assumptions. As a result, macroeconomic factors and related assumptions are often available in a narrow range; however, in some situations these ranges become wide and the use of a different set of input assumptions could produce significantly different budgets and cash flow forecasts. A considerable amount of judgment is also applied in the estimation of the discount rate used in the DCF model. To the extent practical, inputs to the discount rate are obtained from market data sources (e.g., Bloomberg, Capital IQ, etc.). The Company selects and uses a set of publicly traded companies from the relevant industry to estimate the discount rate inputs. Management applies judgment in the selection of such companies based on its view of the most likely market participants. It is reasonably possible that the selection of a different set of likely market participants could produce different input assumptions and result in the use of a different discount rate. Fair value of a reporting unit or a long-lived asset (asset group) is sensitive to both input assumptions to our budgets and cash flow forecasts and the discount rate. Further, estimates of long-term growth and terminal value are often critical to the fair value determination. As part of the impairment evaluation process, management analyzes the sensitivity of fair value to various underlying assumptions. The level of scrutiny increases as the gap between fair value and carrying amount decreases. Changes in any of these assumptions could result in management reaching a different conclusion regarding the potential impairment, which could be material. Our impairment evaluations inherently involve uncertainties from uncontrollable events that could positively or negatively impact the anticipated future economic and operating conditions. Further discussion of the impairment charges recognized by the Company can be found within Note 10 Goodwill and Other Intangible Assets, Note 21 Asset Impairment Expense and Note 9 Other Non-Operating Expense to the Consolidated Financial Statements included in Item 8 of this Form 10-K. 114 Fair Value Fair Value Hierarchy The Company uses valuation techniques and methodologies that maximize the use of observable inputs and minimize the use of unobservable inputs. Where available, fair value is based on observable market prices or parameters or derived from such prices or parameters. Where observable prices are not available, valuation models are applied to estimate the fair value using the available observable inputs. The valuation techniques involve some level of management estimation and judgment, the degree of which is dependent on the price transparency for the instruments or market and the instruments' complexity. To increase consistency and enhance disclosure of the fair value of financial instruments, the fair value measurement standard includes a fair value hierarchy to prioritize the inputs used to measure fair value into three categories. An asset or liability's level within the fair value hierarchy is based on the lowest level of input significant to the fair value measurement, where Level 1 is the highest and Level 3 is the lowest. For more information regarding the fair value hierarchy, see Note 1 General and Summary of Significant Accounting Policies included in Item 8 of this Form 10-K. Fair Value of Financial Instruments A significant number of the Company's financial instruments are carried at fair value with changes in fair value recognized in earnings or other comprehensive income each period. The Company makes estimates regarding the valuation of assets and liabilities measured at fair value in preparing the Consolidated Financial Statements. These assets and liabilities include short and long-term investments in debt and equity securities, included in the balance sheet line items Short-term investments and Other assets (Noncurrent) , derivative assets, included in Other current asset s and Other assets (Noncurrent) and derivative liabilities, included in Accrued and other liabilities (current) and Other long-term liabilities . Investments are generally fair valued based on quoted market prices or other observable market data such as interest rate indices. The Company's investments are primarily certificates of deposit, government debt securities and money market funds. Derivatives are valued using observable data as inputs into internal valuation models. The Company's derivatives primarily consist of interest rate swaps, foreign currency instruments, and commodity and embedded derivatives. Additional discussion regarding the nature of these financial instruments and valuation techniques can be found in Note 4 Fair Value included in Item 8 of this Form 10-K. Fair Value of Nonfinancial Assets and Liabilities Significant estimates are made in determining the fair value of long-lived tangible and intangible assets (i.e., property, plant and equipment, intangible assets and goodwill) during the impairment evaluation process. In addition, the majority of assets acquired and liabilities assumed in a business combination are required to be recognized at fair value under the relevant accounting guidance. In determining the fair value of these items, management makes several assumptions as discussed in the Impairments section above. Accounting for Derivative Instruments and Hedging Activities We enter into various derivative transactions in order to hedge our exposure to certain market risks. We primarily use derivative instruments to manage our interest rate, commodity and foreign currency exposures. We do not enter into derivative transactions for trading purposes. In accordance with the accounting standards for derivatives and hedging, we recognize all derivatives as either assets or liabilities in the balance sheet and measure those instruments at fair value except where derivatives qualify and are designated as "normal purchase/normal sale" transactions. Changes in fair value of derivatives are recognized in earnings unless specific hedge criteria are met. Income and expense related to derivative instruments are recognized in the same category as that generated by the underlying asset or liability. See Note 6 Derivative Instruments and Hedging Activities included in Item 8 of this Form 10-K for further information on the classification. The accounting standards for derivatives and hedging enable companies to designate qualifying derivatives as hedging instruments based on the exposure being hedged. These hedge designations include fair value hedges and cash flow hedges. Changes in the fair value of a derivative that is highly effective and is designated and qualifies as a fair value hedge, are recognized in earnings as offsets to the changes in fair value of the exposure being hedged. The Company has no fair value hedges at this time. Changes in the fair value of a derivative that is highly effective and is designated as and qualifies as a cash flow hedge, are deferred in accumulated other comprehensive income and are recognized into earnings as the hedged transactions occur. Any ineffectiveness is recognized in earnings immediately. For all hedge contracts, the Company provides formal documentation of the hedge and effectiveness testing in accordance with the accounting standards for derivatives and hedging. The fair value measurement accounting standard provides additional guidance on the definition of fair value and defines fair value as the price that would be received to sell an asset or paid to transfer a liability in an orderly transaction between market participants at the measurement date, or exit price. The fair value measurement standard requires the Company to consider and reflect the assumptions of market participants in the fair value calculation. These factors include nonperformance risk (the risk that the obligation will not be fulfilled) and credit risk, both of the reporting entity (for liabilities) and of the counterparty (for assets). Due to the nature of the Company's interest rate swaps, which are typically associated with non-recourse debt, credit risk for AES is evaluated at the subsidiary level rather than at the Parent Company level. Nonperformance 115 risk on the Company's derivative instruments is an adjustment to the initial asset/liability fair value position that is derived from internally developed valuation models that utilize observable market inputs. As a result of uncertainty, complexity and judgment, accounting estimates related to derivative accounting could result in material changes to our financial statements under different conditions or utilizing different assumptions. As a part of accounting for these derivatives, we make estimates concerning nonperformance, volatilities, market liquidity, future commodity prices, interest rates, credit ratings (both ours and our counterparty's), and future exchange rates. Refer to Note 4 Fair Value included in Item 8 of this Form 10-K for additional details. The fair value of our derivative portfolio is generally determined using internal valuation models, most of which are based on observable market inputs including interest rate curves and forward and spot prices for currencies and commodities. The Company derives most of its financial instrument market assumptions from market efficient data sources (e.g., Bloomberg, Reuters and Platt's). In some cases, where market data is not readily available, management uses comparable market sources and empirical evidence to derive market assumptions to determine a financial instrument's fair value. In certain instances, the published curve may not extend through the remaining term of the contract and management must make assumptions to extrapolate the curve. Specifically, where there is limited forward curve data with respect to foreign exchange contracts, beyond the traded points the Company utilizes the purchasing power parity approach to construct the remaining portion of the forward curve using relative inflation rates. Additionally, in the absence of quoted prices, we may rely on "indicative pricing" quotes from financial institutions to input into our valuation model for certain of our foreign currency swaps. These indicative pricing quotes do not constitute either a bid or ask price and therefore are not considered observable market data. For individual contracts, the use of different valuation models or assumptions could have a material effect on the calculated fair value. Regulatory Assets Management continually assesses whether the regulatory assets are probable of future recovery by considering factors such as applicable regulatory changes, recent rate orders applicable to other regulated entities and the status of any pending or potential deregulation legislation. If future recovery of costs ceases to be probable, any asset write-offs would be required to be recognized in operating income. Consolidation The Company has recently entered into several transactions whereby the Company sells an interest in its controlled subsidiaries and/or equity method investments. In connection with each transaction, the Company must determine whether the sale of the interest impacts the Company's consolidation conclusion by first determining whether the transaction should be evaluated under the variable interest model or the voting model. In determining which consolidation model applies to the transaction, the Company is required to make judgments about how the entity operates, the most significant of which are whether (i) the entity has sufficient equity to finance its activities, (ii) the equity holders, as a group, have the characteristics of a controlling financial interest, and (iii) whether the entity has non-substantive voting rights. If the entity is determined to be a variable interest entity, the most significant judgment in determining whether the Company must consolidate the entity is whether the subsidiary, including its related parties and de facto agents, collectively have power and benefits. If AES is determined to have power and benefits, the entity will be consolidated by AES. Alternatively, if the entity is determined to be a voting model entity, the most significant judgments involve determining whether the non-AES shareholders have substantive participating rights. The assessment of shareholder rights and whether they are substantive participating rights requires significant judgment since the rights provided under shareholders' agreements may include selecting, terminating, and setting the compensation of management responsible for implementing the subsidiary's policies and procedures, establishing operating and capital decisions of the entity, including budgets, in the ordinary course of business. On the other hand, if shareholder rights are only protective in nature (referred to as protective rights) then such rights would not overcome the presumption that the owner of a majority voting interest shall consolidate its investee. Significant judgment is required to determine whether minority rights represent substantive participating rights or protective rights that do not affect the evaluation of control. While both represent an approval or veto right, a distinguishing factor is the underlying activity or action to which the right relates. Pension and Other Postretirement Plans Effective January 1, 2016 the Company will apply a disaggregated discount rate approach for determining service cost and interest cost for its defined benefit pension plans and post-retirement plans in the U.S. and U.K. Refer to Note 1 General and Summary of Significant Accounting Policies included in Item 8 of this Form 10-K for further information.
