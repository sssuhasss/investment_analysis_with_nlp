Introduction Dominion is a fully integrated energy company headquartered in Richmond, Virginia. Our strategy is to be a leading provider of electricity, natural gas and related services to customers in the energy intensive Northeast, Mid-Atlantic and Midwest regions of the United States. This area represents about a quarter of the nation landmass, but accounts for approximately 40 percent of energy consumed. Our diversified portfolio of assets includes approximately: 28,100 megawatts of generation capacity; 7,800 miles of interstate natural gas transmission, gathering and storage pipeline; 6,000 miles of electric transmission lines; 6.3 trillion cubic feet equivalent of proved gas and oil reserves; and an underground natural gas storage system with 950 billion cubic feet of capacity, the nation largest. Our businesses are managed through four primary operating segments: Dominion Delivery, Dominion Energy, Dominion Generation and Dominion Exploration & Production. The contributions to net income by our primary operating segments are determined based on a measure of profit that we believe represents the segments core earnings. As a result, certain specific items attributable to those segments are not included in profit measures evaluated by management in assessing segment performance or allocating resources among the segments. Those specific items are reported in the Corporate segment. Dominion Delivery includes our regulated electric and gas distribution and customer service business, as well as non - - 19 Table of Contents regulated retail energy marketing operations. Electric distribution operations serve residential, commercial, industrial and governmental customers in Virginia and northeastern North Carolina. Gas distribution operations serve residential, commercial and industrial gas sales and transportation customers in Ohio, Pennsylvania and West Virginia. Nonregulated retail energy marketing operations include the marketing of gas, electricity and related products and services to residential, industrial and small commercial customers in the Northeast, Mid-Atlantic and Midwest. Revenue provided by electric and gas distribution operations is based primarily on rates established by state regulatory authorities and state law. The profitability of these businesses is dependent on their ability, through the rates they are permitted to charge, to recover costs and earn a reasonable return on their capital investments. Variability relates largely to changes in volumes, which are primarily weather sensitive, and changes in the cost of routine maintenance and repairs (including labor and benefits). Income from retail energy marketing operations varies in connection with changes in weather and commodity prices as well as the acquisition and loss of customers. Dominion Energy includes our tariff-based electric transmission, natural gas transmission pipeline and storage businesses and the Cove Point liquefied natural gas (LNG) facility. It also includes certain natural gas production located in the Appalachian basin and producer services, which consist of aggregation of gas supply, market-based services related to gas transportation and storage, associated gas trading and the prior year results of certain energy trading activities exited in December 2004. The electric transmission business serves Virginia and northeastern North Carolina and on May 1, 2005, became a member of PJM Interconnection, LLC (PJM), a regional transmission organization (RTO). As a result, we integrated our control area into the PJM energy markets. The gas transmission pipeline and storage business serves Dominion gas distribution businesses and other customers in the Northeast, Mid-Atlantic and Midwest. Revenue provided by regulated electric and gas transmission operations and the LNG facility is based primarily on rates approved by the Federal Energy Regulatory Commission (FERC). The profitability of these businesses is dependent on their ability, through the rates they are permitted to charge, to recover costs and earn a reasonable return on their capital investments. Variability results from changes in rates, the demand for services, which is primarily weather dependent, and operating and maintenance expenditures (including labor and benefits). Earnings from Dominion Energy nonregulated businesses are subject to variability associated with changes in commodity prices. Dominion Energy nonregulated businesses use physical and financial arrangements to attempt to hedge this price risk. Certain hedging and trading activities may require cash deposits to satisfy collateral requirements. Variability also results from changes in operating and maintenance expenditures (including labor and benefits). Dominion Generation includes the generation operations of our electric utility and merchant fleet as well as energy marketing and risk management activities associated with the optimization of our generation assets. Our generation mix is diversified and includes coal, nuclear, gas, oil, hydro and purchased power. The generation facilities of our electric utility fleet are located in Virginia, West Virginia and North Carolina. The generation facilities of our merchant fleet are located in Connecticut, Illinois, Indiana, Massachusetts, Ohio, Pennsylvania, Rhode Island, West Virginia and Wisconsin. Dominion Generation earnings result from the generation and sale of electricity. Due to 2004 deregulation legislation, revenues for serving Virginia jurisdictional retail load are based on capped rates through 2010 and fuel costs for the utility fleet, including power purchases, are subject to fixed rate recovery provisions until July 1, 2007, when a one-time prospective adjustment will be made effective through December 2010. Changes in our utility operating costs, particularly with respect to fuel and purchased power, relative to costs used to establish the rates, will impact Dominion Generation earnings. Variability in earnings provided by the merchant fleet relates to changes in market-based prices received for electricity and the demand for electricity, which is primarily weather driven. Variability also results from changes in the cost of fuel consumed, labor and benefits and the timing, duration and costs of scheduled and unscheduled outages. Dominion Exploration & Production (E&P) includes our gas and oil exploration, development and production business. Operations are located in several major producing basins in the lower 48 states, including the outer continental shelf and deepwater areas of the Gulf of Mexico, and Western Canada. Dominion E&P generates income from the sale of natural gas and oil we produce from our reserves. Variability relates primarily to changes in commodity prices, which are market-based, and production volumes, which are impacted by numerous factors including drilling success, timing of development projects and external factors such as storm-related damage caused by hurricanes. We attempt to manage commodity price volatility by hedging a substantial portion of our expected production. These hedging activities may require cash deposits to satisfy collateral requirements. We attempt to mitigate the financial impact of storm-related delays in production by maintaining business interruption insurance for our offshore operations. Our business interruption insurance covers delays caused by damage to both our production facilities and to third-party facilities downstream. Corporate includes the operations of our corporate, service company and other operations (including unallocated debt), corporate-wide enterprise commodity risk management and optimization services, the remaining assets of DCI, which are in the process of being divested, the net impact of our discontinued telecommunications operations that were sold in May 2004 and specific items attributable to our operating segments that are excluded from the profit measures evaluated by management in assessing segment performance or allocating resources among the segments. Accounting Matters Critical Accounting Policies and Estimates We have identified the following accounting policies, including certain inherent estimates, that as a result of the judgments, uncertainties, uniqueness and complexities of the underlying accounting standards and operations involved, could result in material changes to our financial condition or results of operations under different conditions or using different assumptions. We have discussed the development, selection and disclosure of each of these policies with our Audit Committee. Accounting for derivative contracts at fair value We use derivative contracts such as futures, swaps, forwards, options and financial transmission rights to buy and sell energy- related commodities and to manage our commodity and financial markets risks. Derivative contracts, with certain exceptions, are subject to fair value accounting and are reported on our 20 Table of Contents Consolidated Balance Sheets at fair value. Accounting requirements for derivatives and related hedging activities are complex and may be subject to further clarification by standard-setting bodies. Fair value is based on actively quoted market prices, if available. In the absence of actively quoted market prices, we seek indicative price information from external sources, including broker quotes and industry publications. If pricing information from external sources is not available, we must estimate prices based on available historical and near-term future price information and use of statistical methods. For options and contracts with option-like characteristics where pricing information is not available from external sources, we generally use a modified Black-Scholes Model that considers time value, the volatility of the underlying commodities and other relevant assumptions. We use other option models under special circumstances, including a Spread Approximation Model, when contracts include different commodities or commodity locations and a Swing Option Model, when contracts allow either the buyer or seller the ability to exercise within a range of quantities. For contracts with unique characteristics, we estimate fair value using a discounted cash flow approach deemed appropriate in the circumstances and applied consistently from period to period. If pricing information is not available from external sources, judgment is required to develop the estimates of fair value. For individual contracts, the use of different valuation models or assumptions could have a material effect on the contract estimated fair value. For cash flow hedges of forecasted transactions, we must estimate the future cash flows of the forecasted transactions, as well as evaluate the probability of occurrence and timing of such transactions. Changes in conditions or the occurrence of unforeseen events could require discontinuance of hedge accounting or could affect the timing of the reclassification of gains and/or losses on cash flow hedges from accumulated other comprehensive income (loss) (AOCI) into earnings. Use of estimates in goodwill impairment testing As of December 31, 2005, we reported $4.3 billion of goodwill on our Consolidated Balance Sheet, a significant portion of which resulted from the acquisition of Consolidated Natural Gas Company (CNG) in 2000. Substantially all of this goodwill is allocated to our Generation, Transmission, Delivery and Exploration & Production reporting units. In April of each year, we test our goodwill for potential impairment, and perform additional tests more frequently if impairment indicators are present. The 2005 and 2004 annual tests did not result in the recognition of any goodwill impairment, as the estimated fair values of our reporting units exceeded their respective carrying amounts. In 2003, impairment charges of $78 million were recognized as a result of interim tests conducted for certain DCI subsidiaries and our discontinued telecommunications business. We estimate the fair value of our reporting units by using a combination of discounted cash flow analyses, based on our internal five-year strategic plan, and other valuation techniques that use multiples of earnings for peer group companies and analyses of recent business combinations involving peer group companies. These calculations are dependent on subjective factors such as our estimate of future cash flows, the selection of appropriate discount and growth rates, and the selection of peer group companies and recent transactions. These underlying assumptions and estimates are made as of a point in time; subsequent modifications, particularly changes in discount rates or growth rates inherent in our estimates of future cash flows, could result in a future impairment of goodwill. Although we have consistently applied the same methods in developing the assumptions and estimates that underlie the fair value calculations, such as estimates of future cash flows, and based those estimates on relevant information available at the time, such cash flow estimates are highly uncertain by nature and may vary significantly from actual results. If the estimates of future cash flows used in the 2005 annual test had been 10% lower, the resulting fair values would have still been greater than the carrying values of each of those reporting units, indicating no impairment was present. Use of estimates in long-lived asset impairment testing Impairment testing for an individual or group of long-lived assets or intangible assets with definite lives is required when circumstances indicate those assets may be impaired. When an asset carrying amount exceeds the undiscounted estimated future cash flows associated with the asset, the asset is considered impaired to the extent that the asset fair value is less than its carrying amount. Performing an impairment test on long-lived assets involves our judgment in areas such as identifying circumstances indicating an impairment may exist, identifying and grouping affected assets and developing the undiscounted and discounted estimated future cash flows (used to estimate fair value in the absence of market-based value) associated with the asset, including the selection of an appropriate discount rate. Although our cash flow estimates are based on relevant information available at the time the estimates are made, estimates of future cash flows are, by nature, highly uncertain and may vary significantly from actual results. For example, estimates of future cash flows would contemplate factors such as the expected use of the asset, including future production and sales levels, and expected fluctuations of prices of commodities sold and consumed. In 2005, we tested a group of gas and steam turbines held for future development with a carrying amount of $187 million for impairment. The results of our analysis indicated that these assets were not impaired. In 2004, we did not test any significant long-lived assets or asset groups for impairment as no circumstances arose that indicated an impairment may exist. In 2003, reflecting a significant revision in long-term expectations for potential growth in telecommunications service revenue, we approved a strategy to sell our interest in the telecommunications business. In connection with this change in strategy, we tested the network assets to be sold for impairment, using the revised long-term expectations for potential growth. Our assets were determined to be substantially impaired and were written down to fair value. We sold our telecommunications business in 2004. Asset retirement obligations We recognize liabilities for the expected cost of retiring tangible long-lived assets for which a legal obligation exists. These asset retirement obligations (AROs) are recognized at fair value as incurred, and are capitalized as part of the cost of the related tangible long-lived assets. In the absence of quoted market prices, we estimate the fair value of our AROs using present value techniques, in which we make various assumptions including estimates of the amounts and timing of future cash flows associated with retirement activities, credit-adjusted risk free rates and cost escalation rates. AROs currently reported on our Consolidated Balance Sheets were measured during a period of historically low interest rates. The impact on measurements of new AROs, using different rates in the future, may be significant. In the future, if we revise any assumptions used to calculate the fair value of existing AROs, we will adjust the carrying amount of 21 Table of Contents both the ARO liability and related long-lived asset. We record accretion expense, increasing the ARO liability, with the passage of time. In 2005, 2004 and 2003, we recognized $102 million, $91 million and $86 million, respectively, of accretion expense, and expect to incur $124 million in 2006. A significant portion of our AROs relate to the future decommissioning of our nuclear facilities. At December 31, 2005, nuclear decommissioning AROs, which are reported in the Dominion Generation segment, totaled $1.7 billion, representing approximately 77% of our total AROs. Based on their significance, the following discussion of critical assumptions inherent in determining the fair value of AROs relates to those associated with our nuclear decommissioning obligations. We obtain from third-party experts periodic site-specific base year cost studies in order to estimate the nature, cost and timing of planned decommissioning activities for our utility nuclear plants. We use internal and external cost studies for our merchant nuclear facilities based on similar methods. These cost studies are based on relevant information available at the time they are performed; however, estimates of future cash flows for extended periods are by nature highly uncertain and may vary significantly from actual results. In addition, these cost estimates are dependent on subjective factors, including the selection of cost escalation rates, which we consider to be a critical assumption. We determine cost escalation rates, which represent projected cost increases over time, due to both general inflation and increases in the cost of specific decommissioning activities, for each of our nuclear facilities. The use of alternative rates would have been material to the liabilities recognized. For example, had we increased the cost escalation rate by 0.5%, the amount recognized as of December 31, 2005 for our AROs related to nuclear decommissioning would have been $343 million higher. Employee benefit plans We sponsor noncontributory defined benefit pension plans and other postretirement benefit plans for eligible active employees, retirees and qualifying dependents. The costs of providing benefits under these plans are dependent, in part, on historical information such as employee demographics, the level of contributions made to the plans and earnings on plan assets. Assumptions about the future, including the expected rate of return on plan assets, discount rates applied to benefit obligations and the anticipated rate of increase in health care costs and participant compensation, also have a significant impact on employee benefit costs. The impact on pension and other postretirement benefit plan obligations associated with changes in these factors is generally recognized in our Consolidated Statements of Income over the remaining average service period of plan participants rather than immediately. The selection of expected long-term rates of return on plan assets, discount rates and medical cost trend rates are critical assumptions. We determine the expected long-term rates of return on plan assets for pension plans and other postretirement benefit plans by using a combination of: Historical return analysis to determine expected future risk premiums; Forward-looking return expectations derived from the yield on long-term bonds and the price earnings ratios of major stock market indices; Expected inflation and risk-free interest rate assumptions; and Investment allocation of plan assets. The strategic target asset allocation for our pension fund is 45% U.S. equity securities, 8% non-U.S. equity securities, 22% debt securities and 25% other, such as real estate and private equity investments. Assisted by an independent actuary, we develop assumptions, which are then compared to the forecasts of other independent investment advisors to ensure reasonableness. An internal committee selects the final assumptions. We calculated our pension cost using an expected return on plan assets assumption of 8.75% for 2005, 2004 and 2003. We calculated our 2005 other postretirement benefit cost using an expected return on plan assets assumption of 8.00% compared to 7.79% and 7.78% for 2004 and 2003, respectively. The rate used in calculating other postretirement benefit cost is lower than the rate used in calculating pension cost because of differences in the relative amounts of various types of investments held as plan assets and because other postretirement benefit activity, unlike the pension activity, was partially taxable in 2004 and 2003. Discount rates are determined from analyses performed by a third-party actuarial firm of AA/Aa rated bonds with cash flows matching the expected payments to be made under our plans. The discount rate used to calculate 2005 pension and other postretirement benefit costs was 6.00% compared to the 6.25% and 6.75% discount rates used to calculate 2004 and 2003 pension and other postretirement benefit costs, respectively. Lower long-term bond yields were the primary reason for the decline in the discount rate from 2004 to 2005. The medical cost trend rate assumption is established based on analyses performed by a third-party actuarial firm of various factors including the specific provisions of our medical plans, actual cost trends experienced and projected, and demographics of plan participants. Our medical cost trend rate assumption as of December 31, 2005 is 9.00% and is expected to gradually decrease to 5.00% in later years. The following table illustrates the effect on cost of changing the critical actuarial assumptions previously discussed, while holding all other assumptions constant: Increase in Net Periodic Cost Actuarial Assumption Change in Assumption Pension Benefits Other Postretirement Benefits (millions) Discount rate (0.25)% $14 $ 7 Rate of return on plan assets (0.25)% 10 2 Healthcare cost trend rate 1% N/A 26 In addition to the effects on cost, a 0.25% decrease in the discount rate would increase our projected pension benefit obligation by $138 million and would increase our accumulated postretirement benefit obligation by $53 million. Accounting for regulated operations The accounting for our regulated electric and gas operations differs from the accounting for nonregulated operations in that we are required to reflect the effect of rate regulation in our Consolidated Financial Statements. Specifically, our regulated businesses record assets and liabilities that nonregulated companies would not report under accounting principles generally accepted in the United States of America. When it is probable that regulators will permit the recovery of current costs through future rates charged to customers, we defer these costs as regulatory assets that otherwise would be expensed by nonregulated companies. Likewise, we recognize regulatory liabilities when it is probable that regulators will require customer refunds through future rates and when revenue is collected from customers for expenditures that are not yet 22 Table of Contents incurred. Regulatory assets are amortized into expense and regulatory liabilities are amortized into income over the recovery period authorized by the regulator. We evaluate whether or not recovery of our regulatory assets through future regulated rates is probable and make various assumptions in our analyses. The expectations of future recovery are generally based on orders issued by regulatory commissions or historical experience, as well as discussions with applicable regulatory authorities. If recovery of regulatory assets is determined to be less than probable, the regulatory asset will be written off and an expense will be recorded in the period such assessment is made. We currently believe the recovery of our regulatory assets is probable. See Notes 2 and 14 to our Consolidated Financial Statements. Accounting for gas and oil operations We follow the full cost method of accounting for gas and oil exploration and production activities prescribed by the Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC). Under the full cost method, all direct costs of property acquisition, exploration and development activities are capitalized and subsequently depreciated using the units-of-production method. The depreciable base of costs includes estimated future costs to be incurred in developing proved gas and oil reserves, as well as capitalized asset retirement costs, net of projected salvage values. Capitalized costs in the depreciable base are subject to a ceiling test prescribed by the SEC. The test limits capitalized amounts to a ceiling the present value of estimated future net revenues to be derived from the production of proved gas and oil reserves assuming period-end pricing adjusted for cash flow hedges in place. We perform the ceiling test quarterly, on a country-by-country basis, and would recognize asset impairments to the extent that total capitalized costs exceed the ceiling. In addition, gains or losses on the sale or other disposition of gas and oil properties are not recognized, unless the gain or loss would significantly alter the relationship between capitalized costs and proved reserves of natural gas and oil attributable to a country. Our estimate of proved reserves requires a large degree of judgment and is dependent on factors such as historical data, engineering estimates of proved reserve quantities, estimates of the amount and timing of future expenditures to develop the proved reserves, and estimates of future production from the proved reserves. Our estimated proved reserves as of December 31, 2005 are based upon studies for each of our properties prepared by our staff engineers and reviewed by Ryder Scott Company, L.P. Calculations were prepared using standard geological and engineering methods generally accepted by the petroleum industry and in accordance with SEC guidelines. Given the volatility of natural gas and oil prices, it is possible that our estimate of discounted future net cash flows from proved natural gas and oil reserves that is used to calculate the ceiling could materially change in the near-term. The process to estimate reserves is imprecise, and estimates are subject to revision. If there is a significant variance in any of our estimates or assumptions in the future and revisions to the value of our proved reserves are necessary, related depletion expense and the calculation of the ceiling test would be affected and recognition of natural gas and oil property impairments could occur. See Notes 2 and 29 to our Consolidated Financial Statements. Income taxes Judgment and the use of estimates are required in developing the provision for income taxes and reporting of tax-related assets and liabilities. The interpretation of tax laws involves uncertainty, since tax authorities may interpret them differently. We establish liabilities for tax-related contingencies in accordance with Statement of Financial Accounting Standards (SFAS) No. 5, Accounting for Contingencies, and review them in light of changing facts and circumstances. Ultimate resolution of income tax matters may result in favorable or unfavorable impacts to net income and cash flows and adjustments to tax-related assets and liabilities could be material. In addition, deferred income tax assets and liabilities are provided, representing future effects on income taxes for temporary differences between the bases of assets and liabilities for financial reporting and tax purposes. We evaluate quarterly the probability of realizing deferred tax assets by reviewing a forecast of future taxable income and the availability of tax planning strategies that can be implemented, if necessary, to realize deferred tax assets. Failure to achieve forecasted taxable income or successfully implement tax planning strategies may affect the realization of deferred tax assets. Other Accounting Standards During 2005, 2004 and 2003, we were required to adopt several new accounting standards, the requirements of which are discussed in Note 3 to our Consolidated Financial Statements. The adoption of Financial Accounting Standards Board (FASB) Interpretation No. 46 (revised December 2003), Consolidation of Variable Interest Entities. (FIN 46R) on December 31, 2003 with respect to special purpose entities, affected the comparability of our 2005 and 2004 Consolidated Statements of Income to 2003 as follows: We were required to consolidate certain variable interest lessor entities through which we had financed and leased several new power generation projects, as well as our corporate headquarters and aircraft. In 2005 and 2004, our Consolidated Statements of Income reflect depreciation expense on the net property, plant and equipment and interest expense on the debt associated with these entities, whereas in 2003 the lease payments to these entities were reflected as rent expense in other operations and maintenance expense. In addition, under FIN 46R, we report as long-term debt our junior subordinated notes held by five capital trusts, rather than the trust preferred securities issued by those trusts. As a result, in 2005 and 2004 we reported interest expense on the junior subordinated notes rather than preferred distribution expense on the trust preferred securities. Clearinghouse During the fourth quarter of 2004, we performed an evaluation of our Dominion Clearinghouse (Clearinghouse) trading and marketing operations, which resulted in a decision to exit certain energy trading activities and instead focus on the optimization of our assets. In January 2005 in connection with the reorganization, commodity derivative contracts held by the Clearinghouse were assessed to determine if they contribute to the optimization of our assets. As a result of this review, certain commodity derivative contracts previously designated as held for trading purposes are now held for non-trading purposes. Under our derivative income statement classification policy described in Note 2 to our Consolidated Financial Statements, all changes in fair value, including amounts realized upon settlement, related to 23 Table of Contents the reclassified contracts were previously presented in operating revenue on a net basis. Upon reclassification as non-trading, all unrealized changes in fair value and settlements related to those derivative contracts that are financially settled are now reported in other operations and maintenance expense. The statement of income related amounts for those reclassified derivative sales contracts that are physically settled are now presented in operating revenue, while the statement of income related amounts for physically settled purchase contracts are reported in operating expenses. Crude Oil Buy/Sell Arrangements We enter into buy/sell and related agreements primarily as a means to reposition our offshore Gulf of Mexico crude oil production to more liquid marketing locations onshore. We typically enter into either a single or a series of buy/sell transactions in which we sell our crude oil production at the offshore field delivery point and buys similar quantities at Cushing, Oklahoma for sale to third parties. We are able to enhance profitability by selling to a wide array of refiners and/or trading companies at Cushing, one of the largest crude oil markets in the world, versus restricting sales to a limited number of refinery purchasers in the Gulf of Mexico. Under the primary guidance of EITF Issue No. 99-19, Reporting Revenue Gross as a Principal versus Net as an Agent , we present the sales and purchases related to our crude oil buy/sell arrangements on a gross basis in our Consolidated Statements of Income. These transactions require physical delivery of the crude oil and the risks and rewards of ownership are evidenced by title transfer, assumption of environmental risk, transportation scheduling and counterparty nonperformance risk. Amounts currently shown on a gross basis in our Consolidated Statements of Income are summarized below. Year Ended December 31, 2005 2004 2003 (millions) Sale activity included in operating revenue $377 $290 $181 Purchase activity included in operating expenses (1) 362 271 163 (1) Included in other energy-related commodity purchases In September 2005, the FASB ratified the EITF consensus on Issue No. 04-13, Accounting for Purchases and Sales of Inventory with the Same Counterparty , that will require buy/sell and related agreements to be presented on a net basis in our Consolidated Statements of Income if they are entered into in contemplation of one another. This new guidance is required to be applied to all new arrangements entered into, and modifications or renewals of existing arrangements, for reporting periods beginning April 1, 2006. We are currently assessing the impact that this new guidance may have on our income statement presentation of these transactions; however, there will be no impact on our results of operations or cash flows. See Note 4 to our Consolidated Financial Statements. Results of Operations Presented below is a summary of our consolidated results: Year Ended December 31, 2005 $ Change 2004 $ Change 2003 (millions, except EPS) Net Income $ 1,033 $ (216 ) $ 1,249 $931 $ 318 Diluted earnings per share (EPS) 3.00 (0.78 ) 3.78 2.78 1.00 Overview 2005 vs. 2004 Our 2005 results were significantly impacted by Hurricanes Katrina and Rita, which struck the Gulf Coast area in late August and late September 2005, respectively. Due to the hurricanes, our production assets in the Gulf of Mexico and, to a lesser extent, southern Louisiana were temporarily shut in. The interruption in gas and oil production resulted in a $272 million after-tax loss related to the discontinuance of hedge accounting for certain gas and oil hedges. Results were also impacted by delays in production caused by damage to third-party downstream infrastructure. Our 2005 results were also negatively impacted by increased fuel and purchased power expenses incurred by our electric utility operations primarily as a result of higher commodity prices. These negatives were partially offset by higher realized gas and oil prices for our exploration and production operations, gains on the sale of excess emissions allowances and a higher contribution from merchant generation operations primarily reflecting the benefit of two acquisitions during 2005. In January 2005, we completed the acquisition of three fossil fired power stations with generating capacity of more than 2,700 megawatts (Dominion New England) and in July 2005, we completed the acquisition of the 556-megawatt Kewaunee nuclear power station (Kewaunee). 2004 vs. 2003 Our results for 2004 improved dramatically reflecting the absence of $750 million of after-tax losses recognized in 2003 associated with our discontinued telecommunications business that we sold in May 2004. Other positive drivers included higher average realized gas and oil prices and a favorable change in the fair value of certain oil options held by our exploration and production operations. These positives were partially offset by increased fuel expenses incurred by electric utility operations as a result of the elimination of deferred fuel accounting, a loss from energy trading and marketing activities reflecting comparatively lower price volatility on natural gas option positions and the effect of unfavorable price changes on electric trading margins and an after-tax charge related to our interest in a long-term power tolling contract that was divested in 2005, in connection with our exit from certain energy trading activities. 24 Table of Contents Analysis of Consolidated Operations Presented below are selected amounts related to our results of operations: Year ended December 31, 2005 $ Change 2004 $ Change 2003 (millions) Operating Revenue $ 18,041 $4,050 $ 13,991 $1,896 $ 12,095 Operating Expenses Electric fuel and energy purchases 4,713 2,551 2,162 495 1,667 Purchased electric capacity 505 (82 ) 587 (20 ) 607 Purchased gas 3,941 1,014 2,927 752 2,175 Other energy-related commodity purchases 1,391 402 989 543 446 Other operations and maintenance 3,058 292 2,766 (181 ) 2,947 Depreciation, depletion and amortization 1,412 107 1,305 89 1,216 Other taxes 582 63 519 43 476 Other income (loss) 168 1 167 207 (40 ) Interest and related charges 991 52 939 (36 ) 975 Income tax expense 582 (118 ) 700 103 597 Income (loss) from discontinued operations, net of tax 5 20 (15 ) 627 (642 ) Cumulative effect of changes in accounting principles, net of tax (6 ) (6 ) (11 ) 11 An analysis of our results of operations for 2005 compared to 2004 and 2004 compared to 2003 follows. 2005 vs. 2004 Operating Revenue increased 29% to $18.0 billion, primarily reflecting: A $1.9 billion increase in nonregulated electric sales primarily due to a $1.1 billion increase attributable to the addition of Dominion New England and Kewaunee and a full year of commercial operations at our Fairless Energy power station (Fairless), which began operating in June 2004. The increase also reflects a $730 million increase related to the designation of certain commodity derivative contracts as held for non-trading purposes effective January 1, 2005. These contracts were previously held for trading purposes as discussed in Note 28 to our Consolidated Financial Statements. The impact of this change in classification on Operating Revenue was offset by similar changes in Other operations and maintenance expense and Electric fuel and energy purchases expense; An $863 million increase in nonregulated gas sales largely reflecting a $588 million increase from gas aggregation activities and nonregulated retail energy marketing operations primarily due to higher prices, a $110 million increase due to higher natural gas prices related to market-based services for the optimization of transportation and storage assets, partially offset by the effect of unfavorable price changes on unsettled contracts and a $110 million increase in sales of gas purchased by exploration and production operations to facilitate gas transportation and satisfy other agreements. The increases in revenue from gas aggregation activities, nonregulated retail energy marketing operations and exploration and production operations were largely offset by corresponding increases in Purchased gas expense ; A $400 million increase in other energy-related commodity sales reflecting a $276 million increase in nonutility coal sales resulting from higher coal prices ($171 million) and increased sales volumes ($105 million), an $87 million increase in sales of purchased oil by exploration and production operations and a $37 million increase in sales of emissions allowances held for resale primarily due to higher prices. This increase was largely offset by a corresponding increase in Other energy-related commodity purchases expense ; A $363 million increase in regulated electric sales reflecting a $153 million increase in sales to wholesale customers, a $99 million increase due to the impact of a comparatively higher fuel rate for non-Virginia jurisdictional customers, a $77 million increase primarily due to the impact of favorable weather on customer usage and a $59 million increase from customer growth associated with new customer connections, partially offset by a $25 million decrease due to variations in seasonal rate premiums and discounts. The increase resulting from a comparatively higher fuel rate was more than offset by an increase in Electric fuel and energy purchases expense ; and A $341 million increase in regulated gas sales primarily related to the recovery of higher gas prices. The effect of this increase was offset by a comparable increase in Purchased gas expense . Operating Expenses Electric fuel and energy purchases expense increased 118% to $4.7 billion, primarily reflecting the combined effects of: A $1.2 billion increase related to the designation of certain commodity derivative contracts as held for non-trading purposes effective January 1, 2005, which were previously held for trading purposes as discussed in Operating Revenue; A $796 million increase related to utility operations primarily resulting from higher commodity prices including purchased power and congestion costs associated with PJM; and A $556 million increase due to the addition of Dominion New England and Kewaunee and a full year of commercial operations at Fairless. Purchased electric capacity expense decreased 14% to $505 million, as a result of the termination of several long-term power purchase agreements in connection with the purchase of the related generating facilities in 2005 and 2004. Purchased gas expense increased 35% to $3.9 billion, principally resulting from a $522 million increase associated with gas aggregation activities and nonregulated retail energy marketing operations, a $305 million increase associated with regulated gas distribution operations and a $124 million 25 Table of Contents increase related to exploration and production, all of which are discussed in Operating Revenue . Other energy-related commodity purchases expense increased 41% to $1.4 billion, primarily reflecting a $263 million increase in the cost of coal purchased for resale, a $91 million increase related to purchases of oil by exploration and production operations, and a $47 million increase in emissions allowances purchased for resale, all of which are discussed in Operating Revenue . Other operations and maintenance expense increased 11% to $3.1 billion, resulting from: A $423 million loss related to the discontinuance of hedge accounting for certain gas and oil hedges resulting from an interruption of gas and oil production in the Gulf of Mexico caused by Hurricanes Katrina and Rita; A $361 million increase due to the addition of Dominion New England and Kewaunee and a full year of commercial operations at Fairless; A $193 million increase in salaries and benefits, due to higher incentive-based compensation ($106 million), wages ($43 million) and pension and medical benefits ($44 million); A $77 million charge resulting from the termination of a long-term power purchase agreement; A $75 million increase in hedge ineffectiveness expense associated with exploration and production operations, primarily due to an increase in the fair value differential between the delivery location and commodity specifications of our derivative contracts and the delivery location and commodity specifications of our forecasted gas and oil sales; A $59 million loss related to the discontinuance of hedge accounting in March 2005 for certain oil hedges primarily resulting from a delay in reaching anticipated production levels in the Gulf of Mexico, and subsequent changes in the fair value of those hedges; A $51 million charge related to credit exposure associated with the bankruptcy of Calpine Corporation; A $35 million charge related to our investment in and planned divestiture of DCI assets; These increases were partially offset by the following: A $344 million decrease related to the designation of certain commodity derivative contracts as held for non-trading purposes effective January 1, 2005, which were previously held for trading purposes as discussed in Operating Revenue ; A $186 million benefit related to financial transmission rights we received from PJM as a load-serving entity to offset the congestion costs associated with PJM spot market activity, which are included in Electric fuel and energy purchases expense ; A $139 million gain resulting from the sale of excess emissions allowances. Future sales, if any, are dependent on market liquidity and other factors; A $24 million net benefit resulting from the establishment of certain regulatory assets and liabilities in connection with the settlement of a North Carolina rate case in the first quarter of 2005; and The net impact of the following items recognized in 2004: A $184 million charge related to the sale of our interest in a long-term power tolling contract in connection with our exit from certain energy trading activities; A $96 million loss related to the discontinuance of hedge accounting for certain oil hedges resulting from an interruption of oil production in the Gulf of Mexico caused by Hurricane Ivan, and subsequent changes in the fair value of those hedges during the third quarter; A $72 million charge associated with the impairment of retained interests from mortgage securitizations and venture capital and other equity investments held by DCI; and A $71 million net charge resulting from the termination of certain long-term power purchase agreements; partially offset by A $120 million benefit due to favorable changes in the fair value of certain oil options related to exploration and production operations. Depreciation, depletion and amortization expense (DD&A) increased 8% to $1.4 billion, largely due to incremental depreciation and amortization expense resulting from our acquisition of the Dominion New England power plants and other property additions. Other taxes increased 12% to $582 million, primarily due to higher property taxes resulting from the Dominion New England power plants and higher severance taxes associated with increased commodity prices. 2004 vs. 2003 Operating Revenue increased 16% to $14.0 billion, primarily reflecting: A $684 million increase in other energy-related commodity sales reflecting a $384 million increase in nonutility coal sales resulting from higher coal prices and increased sales volumes, a $120 million increase in sales of emissions allowances held for resale due to higher prices and increased sales volumes and a $109 million increase in sales of purchased oil by exploration and production operations. This increase was largely offset by corresponding increase in Other energy-related commodity purchases expense ; A $364 million increase in nonregulated gas sales reflecting a $410 million increase in revenue from gas aggregation activities and nonregulated retail energy marketing operations, due to higher prices and increased volumes and a $61 million increase in revenue from sales of gas purchased by exploration and production operations to facilitate gas transportation and satisfy other agreements, partially offset by a $108 million decrease in revenue from energy trading and marketing activities due to comparatively lower price volatility on natural gas option positions. The increases related to gas aggregation activities, nonregulated retail energy marketing operations and exploration and production operations were largely offset by corresponding increases in Purchased gas expense ; A $304 million increase in regulated electric sales reflecting a $231 million increase due to the impact of a comparatively higher fuel rate on increased sales volumes and a $49 million increase from customer growth associated with new customer connections. The rate increase resulted from the settlement of a Virginia fuel rate case in December 2003. This increase was more than offset by an increase in Electric fuel and energy purchases expense ; A $164 million increase in regulated gas sales reflecting a $198 million increase due to higher rates for regulated gas distribution operations primarily related to the recovery of higher gas prices and a $20 million increase resulting from the return of customers from Energy Choice programs, partially offset by an $87 million decrease associated with milder weather and lower industrial sales. The effect of this net increase was largely offset by a comparable increase in Purchased gas expense; 26 Table of Contents A $133 million increase in gas and oil production revenue primarily reflecting a $97 million increase in revenue from gas production primarily due to higher average realized prices and a $36 million increase in revenue from oil production primarily reflecting higher volumes; and A $119 million increase in nonregulated electric sales reflecting a $181 million increase in revenue from nonregulated retail energy marketing operations largely due to increased volumes and a $97 million increase in revenue from merchant generation operations, largely due to the commencement of commercial operations at Fairless in June 2004, partially offset by decreased revenue at certain other stations resulting from lower output. These increases were partially offset by a $140 million decrease in revenue from energy trading and marketing activities reflecting decreased margins in electric trading due to unfavorable price movements. Operating Expenses and Other Items Electric fuel and energy purchases expense increased 30% to $2.2 billion, primarily reflecting: A $408 million increase related to regulated utility operations resulting from the combined effects of an increase in the fixed fuel rate and the elimination of fuel deferral accounting for the Virginia jurisdiction, which resulted in the recognition of fuel expenses in excess of amounts recovered in fixed fuel rates. The increase also reflects higher generation output; A $162 million increase related to nonregulated retail energy marketing operations discussed in Operating Revenue ; An $88 million increase related to merchant generation operations, largely due to the addition of Fairless, partially offset by decreased fuel expense at certain other stations resulting from lower generation output; partially offset by A $163 million decrease related to energy marketing and risk management activities. Purchased gas expense increased 35% to $2.9 billion, principally resulting from: A $357 million increase associated with gas aggregation activities and nonregulated retail energy marketing operations discussed in Operating Revenue ; A $130 million increase associated with regulated gas distribution operations discussed in Operating Revenue ; A $66 million increase from gas transmission operations due to increased gathering and extraction activities and higher gas usage; and A $58 million increase associated with exploration and production operations discussed in Operating Revenue . Other energy-related commodity purchases expense increased 122% to $989 million, primarily reflecting a $348 million increase in coal purchased for resale, a $108 million increase related to purchases of oil by our exploration and production operations and a $105 million increase in the cost of emissions allowances purchased for resale, each of which are discussed in Operating Revenue . Other operations and maintenance expense decreased 6% to $2.8 billion, resulting from: A $113 million net benefit due to favorable changes in the fair value of certain oil options related to exploration and production operations. During 2004, we effectively settled certain oil options not designated as hedges by entering into offsetting option positions that had the effect of preserving approximately $120 million in mark-to-market gains attributable to favorable changes in time value; and The impact of the following charges recognized in 2003: A $197 million charge representing incremental electric utility restoration expenses associated with Hurricane Isabel; A $108 million charge from asset and goodwill impairments associated with DCI financial services operations; A $105 million charge associated with the termination of certain long-term power purchase agreements; A $64 million charge for the restructuring of certain electric sales contracts recorded as derivative assets; A $60 million goodwill impairment associated with the purchase of the remaining interest in the telecommunications joint venture, Dominion Fiber Ventures, LLC (DFV), held by another party; A $28 million charge related to severance costs for workforce reductions; and A $22 million impairment related to CNG International (CNGI) generation assets that were sold in December 2003. These benefits were partially offset by the following charges and incremental expenses recognized in 2004: A $184 million charge related to the sale of our interest in a long-term power tolling contract; A $96 million loss related to the discontinuance of hedge accounting for certain oil hedges resulting from an interruption of oil production in the Gulf of Mexico caused by Hurricane Ivan, and subsequent changes in the fair value of those hedges during the third quarter; A $72 million charge associated with the impairment of retained interests from mortgage securitizations and venture capital and other equity investments held by DCI; A $71 million net charge associated with the termination of certain long-term power purchase agreements; An approximate $60 million increase in costs related to gas and oil production activities; An $18 million increase in reliability expenses associated with utility operations primarily due to increased tree-trimming; A $13 million increase related to salaries, wages and benefits resulting from a $60 million increase in pension and medical benefits and a $46 million increase due to wage increases and other factors, partially offset by an $89 million decrease in incentive-based compensation expense due to failure to meet targeted earnings goals; and A $10 million charge associated with the sale of our natural gas and oil assets in British Columbia, Canada. 27 Table of Contents Depreciation, depletion and amortization expense increased 7% to $1.3 billion, largely due to incremental depreciation expense resulting from property additions, including those resulting from the consolidation of certain variable interest entities as a result of adopting FIN 46R at December 31, 2003. Other taxes increased 9% to $519 million, primarily due to higher gross receipts taxes and higher severance and property taxes associated with increased commodity prices. Other income increased to $167 million from a net loss of $40 million in 2003, primarily reflecting: A $61 million increase resulting from net realized gains (including investment income) associated with nuclear decommissioning trust fund investments as opposed to net realized losses (net of investment income) in 2003; A $23 million benefit associated with the disposition of CNGI investment in Australian pipeline assets that were sold during 2004; and The impact of the following charges recognized in 2003, which did not recur in 2004: $57 million of costs associated with the acquisition of DFV senior notes; $27 million for the reallocation of equity losses between us and the minority interest owner of DFV; and A $62 million impairment of CNGI investment in Australian pipeline assets held for sale. Income tax expense Our effective tax rate decreased 3.0% to 35.6% for 2004, reflecting an increase in the valuation allowance for 2003 with no comparable increase in 2004, partially offset by increases in 2004 in utility plant differences and other factors. Loss from discontinued operations decreased to $15 million from $642 million, primarily reflecting the sale of our discontinued telecommunications operations during May 2004 and the impact of the following charges recognized in 2003: Impairment of network assets and related inventories of $566 million. We did not recognize any deferred tax benefits related to the impairment charges, since realization of tax benefits was not anticipated at the time based on our expected future tax profile. In addition, we increased the valuation allowance on deferred tax assets recognized by our telecommunications investment, resulting in a $48 million increase in deferred income tax expense; and Telecommunications operating losses of $28 million. Outlook In order to deliver results to shareholders, we are focused on maintaining operational excellence, managing generation-related fuel expenses, increasing gas and oil production and managing commodity price risk. In 2006, we believe our operating businesses will provide moderate growth in net income on a per share basis, including the impact of higher expected average shares outstanding. Positive drivers include: Continued growth in utility customers; Receipt of business interruption insurance proceeds for delays in gas and oil production caused by Hurricanes Katrina and Rita; An increase in gas and oil production and higher realized prices for gas and oil; and A full year contribution from Kewaunee. The positive drivers will be partially offset by: A potential decrease in regulated electric sales, as compared to 2005, assuming our utility service territory experiences a return to normal weather in 2006; A decrease in gains from the sale of excess emissions allowances; A full year reduction in rates charged by gas transmission operations due to a rate settlement that was effective in July 2005; Higher expected operating expenses for gas and oil production; and Increased pension and other benefits expense. Based on these projections, we estimate that cash flow from operations will increase in 2006, as compared to 2005. We believe this increase will provide sufficient cash flow to maintain or grow our current dividend to common shareholders. 28 Table of Contents Segment Results of Operations Segment results include the impact of intersegment revenues and expenses, which may result in intersegment profit or loss.

Operations are located in several major producing basins in the lower 48 states, including the outer continental shelf and deepwater areas of the Gulf of Mexico, and Western Canada. Presented below, on an after-tax basis, are the key factors impacting Dominion E&P net income contribution: 2005 vs. 2004 Increase (Decrease) Amount EPS (millions, except EPS) Operations and maintenance (1) $ (134 ) $ (0.41 ) Gas and oil production (2) (111 ) (0.34 ) Interest expense (3) (25 ) (0.08 ) Gas and oil prices 185 0.56 Business interruption insurance Hurricane Ivan 50 0.15 Other 5 0.02 Share dilution (0.06 ) Change in net income contribution $ (30 ) $ (0.16 ) (1) Reflects the impact in 2004 of favorable changes in the fair value of certain oil options, an increase in hedge ineffectiveness expense in 2005 and the discontinuance of hedge accounting for certain oil hedges in March 2005 largely resulting from delays in reaching anticipated production levels in the Gulf of Mexico, and subsequent changes in the fair value of those hedges, partially offset by a benefit reflecting the impact of a decrease in gas and oil prices on hedges that were de-designated following Hurricanes Katrina and Rita. (2) Reflects interruptions caused by Hurricanes Katrina and Rita and the sale of the majority of our natural gas and oil properties in British Columbia, Canada in December 2004. (3) Represents the combined impact of an increase in affiliate borrowings and higher interest rates, as well as prepayment penalties resulting from the early redemption of Canadian debt. 2004 vs. 2003 Increase (Decrease) Amount EPS (millions, except EPS) Gas and oil prices $ 67 $ 0.21 Business interruption insurance Hurricane Ivan 61 0.19 Gas and oil production 40 0.13 Operations and maintenance (1) 26 0.08 DD&A (2) (17 ) (0.05 ) Other 3 0.01 Share dilution (0.07 ) Change in net income contribution $ 180 $ 0.50 (1) Lower operations and maintenance expenses, primarily due to favorable changes in the fair value of certain oil options, partially offset by an increase in production costs. (2) Higher depreciation, depletion and amortization, primarily reflecting higher industry finding and development costs and increased acquisition costs. Included below are the volumes and weighted average prices associated with economic hedges in place as of December 31, 2005 by applicable time period. Prior cash flow hedges for which hedge accounting was discontinued due to production interruptions caused by Hurricanes Katrina and Rita, and for which amounts were reclassified from AOCI to earnings upon the discontinuance of hedge accounting, are excluded from the following table: Natural Gas Oil Year Hedged production (bcf) Average hedge price (per mcf) Hedged production (million bbls) Average hedge price (per bbl) 2006 219.8 $ 4.72 12.7 $ 25.25 2007 202.2 5.60 10.0 33.41 2008 54.0 6.49 5.0 49.36 31 Table of Contents Corporate Presented below are the Corporate segment after-tax results: 2005 2004 2003 (millions, except EPS amounts) Specific items attributable to operating segments $ (505) $(224) $(220) DCI operations (22) (82) (96) Telecommunications operations (1) 5 (13) (750) Other corporate operations (179) (208) (342) Total net expense (701) (527) (1,408) Earnings per share impact $(2.04) $(1.59) $(4.41) (1) $5 million, $(15) million and $(642) million are classified as discontinued operations in 2005, 2004 and 2003, respectively. Specific Items Attributable to Operating Segments 2005 We reported expenses of $505 million in the Corporate segment attributable to our operating segments. The expenses in 2005 primarily related to the impact of the following: A $556 million loss ($357 million after-tax), related to the discontinuance of hedge accounting for certain gas and oil hedges resulting from an interruption of gas and oil production in the Gulf of Mexico caused by Hurricanes Katrina and Rita, and subsequent changes in the fair value of those hedges, attributable to Dominion E&P; A $77 million ($47 million after-tax) charge resulting from the termination of a long-term power purchase agreement, attributable to Dominion Generation; and A $51 million charge related to credit exposure associated with the bankruptcy of Calpine Corporation, attributable to Dominion Generation. We have not recognized any deferred tax benefits related to the charge, since realization of tax benefits is not anticipated at this time based on our expected future tax profile. Specific Items Attributable to Operating Segments 2004 We reported net expenses of $224 million in the Corporate segment attributable to our operating segments. The net expenses in 2004 primarily related to the impact of the following: A $184 million charge ($112 million after-tax) related to the sale of our interest in a long-term power tolling contract, attributable to Dominion Generation; $96 million of losses ($61 million after-tax) related to the discontinuance of hedge accounting for certain oil hedges, resulting from an interruption of oil production in the Gulf of Mexico caused by Hurricane Ivan, and subsequent changes in the fair value of those hedges during the third quarter, attributable to Dominion E&P; and $71 million of charges ($43 million after-tax) resulting from the termination of certain long-term power purchase contracts, attributable to Dominion Generation. Specific Items Attributable to Operating Segments 2003 We reported net expenses of $220 million in the Corporate segment attributable to our operating segments. The net expenses in 2003 primarily related to the impact of the following: $21 million net after-tax benefit representing the cumulative effect of adopting new accounting principles, as described in Note 3 to our Consolidated Financial Statements, including: SFAS No. 143, Accounting for Asset Retirement Obligations: a $180 million after-tax benefit attributable to: Dominion Generation ($188 million after-tax benefit); Dominion E&P ($7 million after-tax charge); and Dominion Delivery ($1 million after-tax charge); Emerging Issues Task Force (EITF) Issue No. 02-3, Issues Involved in Accounting for Derivative Contracts Held for Trading Purposes and Contracts Involved in Energy Trading and Risk Management Activities: a $67 million after-tax charge attributable to Dominion Energy; Statement 133 Implementation Issue No. C20, Interpretation of the Meaning of Not Clearly and Closely Related in Paragraph 10(b) regarding Contracts with a Price Adjustment Feature: a $75 million after-tax charge attributable to Dominion Generation; and FIN 46R: a $17 million after-tax charge attributable to Dominion Generation; $197 million of operations and maintenance expense ($122 million after-tax), representing incremental restoration expenses associated with Hurricane Isabel, attributable primarily to Dominion Delivery; A $105 million charge ($65 million after-tax) for the termination of power purchase agreements attributable to Dominion Generation; A $64 million charge ($39 million after-tax) for the restructuring and termination of certain electric sales agreements attributable to Dominion Generation; and $26 million of severance costs ($15 million after-tax) for workforce reductions during the first quarter of 2003, attributable to: Dominion Generation ($8 million after-tax); Dominion Energy ($2 million after-tax); Dominion Delivery ($4 million after-tax); and Dominion E&P ($1 million after-tax). DCI Operations DCI net loss for 2005 decreased $60 million, primarily due to a reduction in after-tax charges associated with the impairment and divestiture of DCI investments. DCI recognized a net loss of $82 million in 2004; a decrease of $14 million as compared to 2003. The decrease primarily resulted from a $20 million reduction in after-tax charges associated with asset impairments. Telecommunications Operations We sold our telecommunications business in May 2004 to Elantic Telecom, Inc., which subsequently filed for bankruptcy. Due to the resolution of certain contingencies, we recognized an after-tax benefit of $5 million in 2005 related to the discontinued telecommunications business. The loss from our discontinued telecommunications business decreased $737 million to $13 million in 2004, primarily due to the impact of certain charges recognized during 2003, which included: $566 million associated with the impairment of network assets and related inventories. We have not recognized any deferred tax benefits related to the impairment charges, since realization of tax benefits will be dependent on our expected future tax profile; A $48 million increase in deferred tax expense as a result of an increase in the valuation allowance on deferred tax assets; Our purchase of the remaining equity interest in DFV held by another party for $62 million in December 2003, $60 million of which was recorded as goodwill and impaired; $57 million ($35 million after-tax) for the costs associated with our acquisition of DFV senior notes; and $41 million of after-tax operating losses. Other Corporate Operations The net expenses associated with other corporate operations for 2005 decreased by $29 million as compared to 2004, primarily 32 Table of Contents reflecting an increase in interest income from affiliate advances and higher income tax benefits. This was partially offset by the impact in 2004 of a $28 million after-tax benefit associated with the disposition of CNGI investment in Australian pipeline assets. The net expenses associated with other corporate operations for 2004 decreased by $134 million as compared to 2003, predominantly due to a $28 million after-tax benefit associated with the sale of CNGI investment in Australian pipeline assets in 2004, lower interest expense and the impact in 2003 of the following charges: A $22 million ($14 million after-tax) impairment related to CNGI generation assets that were sold in December 2003; A $62 million ($55 million after-tax) impairment of CNGI investment in Australian pipeline assets that were held for sale; and A $16 million ($10 million after-tax) loss representing the cumulative effect of adopting FIN 46R. Selected Information Energy Trading Activities We engage in energy trading, marketing and hedging activities to complement our integrated energy businesses and facilitate our risk management activities. As part of these operations, we enter into contracts for purchases and sales of energy-related commodities, including natural gas, electricity, oil and coal. Settlements of contracts may require physical delivery of the underlying commodity or cash settlement. We also enter into contracts with the objective of benefiting from changes in prices. For example, after entering into a contract to purchase a commodity, we typically enter into a sales contract, or a combination of sales contracts, with quantities and delivery or settlement terms that are identical or very similar to those of the purchase contract. When the purchase and sales contracts are settled either by physical delivery of the underlying commodity or by net cash settlement, we may receive a net cash margin (a realized gain), or may pay a net cash margin (a realized loss). We continually monitor our contract positions, considering location and timing of delivery or settlement for each energy commodity in relation to market price activity. A summary of the changes in the unrealized gains and losses recognized for our energy-related derivative instruments held for trading purposes during 2005 follows: Amount (millions) Net unrealized gain at December 31, 2004 $ 146 Contracts realized or otherwise settled during the period (106 ) Net unrealized gain at inception of contracts initiated during the period Changes in valuation techniques Redefinition of trading contracts (1) 2 Other changes in fair value (49 ) Net unrealized loss at December 31, 2005 $ (7 ) (1) Represents the designation of certain commodity derivative contracts as non-trading that were previously held for trading purposes as discussed in Note 28 to our Consolidated Financial Statements. The balance of net unrealized gains and losses recognized for our energy-related derivative instruments held for trading pur poses at December 31, 2005, is summarized in the following table based on the approach used to determine fair value: Maturity Based on Contract Settlement or Delivery Date(s) Source of Fair Value Less than 1 year 1-2 years 2-3 years 3-5 years In excess of 5 years Total (millions) Actively quoted (1) $ 14 $ (7 ) $ (10 ) $ 2 $ (1 ) Other external sources (2) (4 ) (1 ) $ (1 ) (6 ) Models and other valuation methods Total $ 14 $ (11 ) $ (10 ) $ 1 $ (1 ) $ (7 ) (1) Exchange-traded and over-the-counter contracts. (2) Values based on prices from over-the-counter broker activity and industry services and, where applicable, conventional option pricing models. Sources and Uses of Cash We depend on both internal and external sources of liquidity to provide working capital and to fund capital requirements. Short-term cash requirements not met by cash provided by operations are generally satisfied with proceeds from short-term borrowings. Long-term cash needs are met through sales of securities and additional long-term financing. At December 31, 2005, we had cash and cash equivalents of $146 million and $2.0 billion of unused capacity under our credit facilities. Operating Cash Flows As presented on our Consolidated Statements of Cash Flows, net cash flows from operating activities were $2.6 billion, $2.8 billion and $2.4 billion for the years ended December 31, 2005, 2004 and 2003, respectively. We believe that our operations provide a stable source of cash flow sufficient to contribute to planned levels of capital expenditures and maintain or grow the dividend on common shares. The declaration and payment of dividends are subject to the discretion of our Board of Directors and will depend upon our results of operations, financial condition, capital requirements and future prospects. Our operations are subject to risks and uncertainties that may negatively impact the timing or amounts of operating cash flow, including: Cost-recovery shortfalls due to capped base rates and fixed fuel recovery provisions in effect in Virginia for our generation operations ; The collection of business interruption insurance proceeds associated with the recovery of delayed gas and oil production due to Hurricanes Katrina and Rita; Unusual weather and its effect on energy sales to customers and energy commodity prices; Extreme weather events that could disrupt gas and oil production or cause catastrophic damage to our electric distribution and transmission systems; Exposure to unanticipated changes in prices for energy commodities purchased or sold, including the effect on derivative instruments that may require the use of funds to post collateral with counterparties; Effectiveness of our risk management activities and underlying assessment of market conditions and related factors, including energy commodity prices, basis, liquidity, volatility, counterparty credit risk, availability of generation and transmission capacity, currency exchange rates and interest rates; 33 Table of Contents The cost of replacement electric energy in the event of longer-than-expected or unscheduled generation outages; Contractual or regulatory restrictions on transfers of funds among Dominion and our subsidiaries; and Timeliness of recovery for costs subject to cost-of-service utility rate regulation. Credit Risk Exposure to potential concentrations of credit risk results primarily from our energy marketing and risk management activities and sales of gas and oil production. Presented below is a summary of our gross and net credit exposure as of December 31, 2005 for these activities. We calculate our gross credit exposure for each counterparty as the unrealized fair value of derivative contracts plus any outstanding receivables (net of payables, where netting agreements exist), prior to the application of collateral. Gross Credit Exposure Credit Collateral Net Credit Exposure (millions) Investment grade (1) $ 931 $ 143 $ 788 Non-investment grade (2) 26 26 No external ratings: Internally rated investment grade (3) 46 46 Internally rated non-investment grade (4) 343 343 Total $ 1,346 $ 143 $ 1,203 (1) Designations as investment grade are based upon minimum credit ratings assigned by Moody Investors Service (Moody s) and Standard & Poor Rating Group, a division of the McGraw-Hill Companies, Inc. (Standard & Poor s). The five largest counterparty exposures, combined, for this category represented approximately 19% of the total net credit exposure. (2) The five largest counterparty exposures, combined, for this category represented approximately 2% of the total net credit exposure. (3) The five largest counterparty exposures, combined, for this category represented approximately 4% of the total net credit exposure. (4) The five largest counterparty exposures, combined, for this category represented approximately 7% of the total net credit exposure. Investing Cash Flows During 2005, 2004 and 2003, investing activities resulted in net cash outflows of $3.4 billion, $1.2 billion, and $3.4 billion respectively. Significant investing activities for 2005 included: $1.7 billion of capital expenditures for the construction and expansion of generation facilities, environmental upgrades, purchase of nuclear fuel, construction and improvements of gas and electric transmission and distribution assets and the cost of acquiring a nonutility generating facility; $1.7 billion of capital expenditures for the purchase and development of gas and oil producing properties, drilling and equipment costs and undeveloped lease acquisitions; $877 million primarily related to the acquisition of the Dominion New England power plants and the Kewaunee power station; and $854 million for the purchase of securities; partially offset by $754 million of proceeds from the sale of securities; $595 million of proceeds from sales of gas and oil mineral rights and properties; and $234 million of proceeds from sales of excess emissions allowances. Financing Cash Flows and Liquidity We rely on banks and capital markets as significant sources of funding for capital requirements not satisfied by cash provided by the companies operations. As discussed further in the Credit Ratings section below, our ability to borrow funds or issue secu rities and the return demanded by investors are affected by the issuing company credit ratings. In addition, the raising of external capital is subject to certain regulatory approvals, including registration with the SEC and, in the case of Virginia Electric and Power Company (Virginia Power), approval by the Virginia State Corporation Commission (Virginia Commission). In December 2005, the SEC adopted rules that modify the registration, communications and offering processes under the Securities Act of 1933. The rules streamline the shelf registration process to provide registrants with more timely access to capital. Under the new rules, Dominion and Virginia Power meet the definition of a well-known seasoned issuer. This allows them to use an automatic shelf registration statement to register any offering of securities, other than those for business combination transactions. During 2005 and 2003, net cash flows from financing activities were $522 million and $853 million, respectively. During 2004 net cash used in financing activities was $1.3 billion. Significant financing activities in 2005 included: $2.3 billion from the issuance of long-term debt; $1.0 billion from the net issuance of short-term debt; $664 million from the issuance of common stock; partially offset by $2.2 billion for the repayment of long-term debt; $923 million of common dividend payments; and $276 million for the repurchase of common stock. Credit Facilities and Short-Term Debt We use short-term debt, primarily commercial paper, to fund working capital requirements, as a bridge to long-term debt financing and as bridge financing for acquisitions, if applicable. The level of our borrowings may vary significantly during the course of the year, depending upon the timing and amount of cash requirements not satisfied by cash from operations. In addition, we utilize cash and letters of credit to fund collateral requirements under our commodities hedging program. Collateral requirements are impacted by commodity prices, hedging levels and our credit quality and the credit quality of our counterparties. In May 2005, we entered into a $2.5 billion five-year revolving credit facility that replaced our $1.5 billion three-year facility dated May 2004 and our $750 million three-year facility dated May 2002. In August 2005, CNG entered into a $1.75 billion five-year facility that replaced its $1.5 billion three-year facility dated August 2004. At December 31, 2005, we had committed lines of credit totaling $4.25 billion. Although there were no loans outstanding, these lines of credit support commercial paper borrowings and letter of credit issuances. At December 31, 2005, we had the following commercial paper and letters of credit outstanding and capacity available under credit facilities: Facility Limit Outstanding Commercial Paper Outstanding Letters of Credit Facility Capacity Available (millions) Five-year revolving credit facility (1) $ 2,500 $ 1,401 $ 892 $ 207 Five-year CNG credit facility (2) 1,750 187 1,227 336 Totals $ 4,250 $ 1,588 $ 2,119 $ 543 (1) The $2.5 billion five-year credit facility was entered into in May 2005 and terminates in May 2010. This credit facility can also be used to support up to $1.25 billion of letters of credit. In February 2006, this facility was replaced by a $3.0 billion five-year credit facility that terminates in February 2011. (2) The $1.75 billion five-year credit facility is used to support the issuance of letters of credit and commercial paper by CNG to fund collateral requirements under its gas and oil hedging program. The facility was entered into in August 2005 and terminates in August 2010. In February 2006, the facility limit was reduced to $1.70 billion. 34 Table of Contents We have also entered into several bilateral credit facilities in addition to the facilities above in order to provide collateral required on derivative contracts used in our risk management strategies for merchant generation and gas and oil production operations, respectively. Collateral requirements have increased significantly in 2005 as a result of escalating commodity prices. At December 31, 2005, we had the following letter of credit facilities: Company Facility Limit Outstanding Letters of Credit Facility Capacity Remaining Facility Inception Date Facility Maturity Date (millions) CNG $ 100 $ 100 $ June 2004 June 2007 CNG 100 100 August 2004 August 2009 CNG (1) 550 550 October 2004 April 2006 CNG (2) 1,900 625 1,275 August 2005 February 2006 CNG (3) 200 200 December 2005 December 2010 Dominion Resources, Inc. 150 150 September 2005 March 2006 Dominion Resources, Inc. 200 200 August 2005 February 2006 Dominion Resources, Inc. (4) 290 290 October 2005 April 2006 $ 3,490 $ 2,015 $1,475 (1) In February 2006, the facility limit was reduced to $150 million. (2) In February 2006, CNG replaced this facility with a $1.05 billion 364-day credit facility. (3) This facility can also be used to support commercial paper borrowings. (4) In February 2006, the facility limit was reduced to $215 million. In connection with our commodity hedging activities, we are required to provide collateral to counterparties under some circumstances. Under certain collateral arrangements, we may satisfy these requirements by electing to either deposit cash, post letters of credit or, in some cases, utilize other forms of security. From time to time, we vary the form of collateral provided to counterparties after weighing the costs and benefits of various factors associated with the different forms of collateral. These factors include short-term borrowing and short-term investment rates, the spread over these short-term rates at which we can issue commercial paper, balance sheet impacts, the costs and fees of alternative collateral postings with these and other counterparties and overall liquidity management objectives. Our financial policy precludes issuing commercial paper in excess of our supporting lines of credit. At December 31, 2005, the total amount of commercial paper outstanding was $1.6 billion and the total amount of letter of credit issuances was $4.1 billion, leaving approximately $2.0 billion available for issuance. We are required to pay minimal annual commitment fees to maintain the credit facilities. In addition, these credit agreements contain various terms and conditions that could affect our ability to borrow under these facilities. They include maximum debt to total capital ratios, material adverse change clauses and cross-default provisions. All of the credit facilities include a defined maximum total debt to total capital ratio. As of December 31, 2005, the calculated ratio for our companies, pursuant to the terms of the agreements, was as follows: Company Maximum Ratio Actual Ratio (1) Dominion Resources, Inc. 65% 59% Virginia Power 65% 46% CNG 65% 55% (1) Indebtedness as defined by the bank agreements excludes certain junior subordinated notes payable to affiliated trusts and mandatorily convertible securities that are reflected as long-term debt on our Consolidated Balance Sheets. These provisions apply separately to Dominion Resources, Inc., Virginia Power and CNG (the Dominion Companies). If any one of the Dominion Companies or any of that specific company material subsidiaries fail to make payment on various debt obligations in excess of $25 million, the lenders could require that respective company to accelerate its repayment of any outstanding borrowings under the credit facility and the lenders could terminate their commitment to lend funds to that company. Accordingly, any defaults on indebtedness by CNG or any of its material subsidiaries would not affect the lenders commitment to Virginia Power. Similarly, any defaults on indebtedness by Virginia Power or any of its material subsidiaries would not affect the lenders commitment to CNG. However, any default by either CNG or Virginia Power would also affect in like manner the lenders commitment to Dominion Resources, Inc. under the joint credit agreements. Although the joint credit agreements contain material adverse change clauses, the participating lenders, under those specific provisions, cannot refuse to advance funds to any of the Dominion Companies for the repurchase of our outstanding commercial paper. Long-Term Debt During 2005, Dominion Resources, Inc. issued the following long-term debt: Type Principal Rate Maturity (millions) Senior notes $1,000 variable 2007 Senior notes 300 4.75% 2010 Senior notes 500 5.15% 2015 Senior notes 500 5.95% 2035 Total long-term debt issued $2,300 In February 2005, in connection with the acquisition of a nonutility generating facility from Panda-Rosemary LP (Rosemary), Virginia Power assumed $62 million of Rosemary 8.625% senior notes that mature in 2016. In addition, in February and April of 2005, Virginia Power issued $2 million and $6 million, respectively, of 7.25% promissory notes, which mature in 2025 and 2032, respectively, in exchange for electric distribution facilities at certain military bases in connection with their privatization. In January 2006, Virginia Power issued $450 million of 5.4% senior notes that mature in 2016 and $550 million of 6.0% senior notes that mature in 2036. Table of Contents In February 2006, Dominion Energy Brayton Point, LLC borrowed $47 million in connection with the Massachusetts Development Finance Agency issuance of its Solid Waste Disposal Revenue Bonds (Dominion Energy Brayton Point Issue) Series 2006, which mature in 2036 and bear a coupon rate of 5%, in order to finance certain improvements to our Brayton Point Station located in Somerset, Massachusetts. During 2005, we repaid $2.2 billion of long-term debt securities. Issuance of Common Stock During 2005, we received proceeds of $345 million for 5.8 million shares issued through Dominion Direct (a dividend reinvestment and open enrollment direct stock purchase plan), employee savings plans and the exercise of employee stock options. In February 2005, Dominion Direct and the Dominion employee savings plans began purchasing Dominion common stock on the open market with the proceeds received through these programs, rather than having additional new common shares issued. Repurchases of Common Stock In February 2005, we were authorized by our Board of Directors to repurchase up to the lesser of 25 million shares or $2.0 billion of our outstanding common stock. During 2005, we repurchased 3.7 million shares for approximately $276 million. Forward Equity Transaction In September 2004, we entered into a forward equity sale agreement (forward agreement) with Merrill Lynch International (MLI), as forward purchaser, relating to 10 million shares of our common stock. The forward agreement provided for the sale of two tranches of our common stock, each with stated maturity dates and settlement prices. In connection with the forward agreement, MLI borrowed an equal number of shares of our common stock from stock lenders and, at our request, sold the borrowed shares to J.P. Morgan Securities Inc. (JPM) under a purchase agreement among Dominion, MLI and JPM. JPM subsequently offered the borrowed shares to the public. We accounted for the forward agreement as equity at its initial fair value but did not receive any proceeds from the sale of the borrowed shares. The use of a forward agreement allowed us to avoid equity market uncertainty by pricing a stock offering under then existing market conditions, while mitigating share dilution by postponing the issuance of stock until funds were needed. Except in specified circumstances or events that would have required physical share settlement, we were able to elect to settle the forward agreement by means of a physical share, cash or net share settlement and were also able to elect to settle the agreement in whole, or in part, earlier than the stated maturity date at fixed settlement prices. Under either a physical share or net share settlement, the maximum number of shares that were deliverable under the terms of the forward agreement was limited to the 10 million shares specified in the two tranches. Assuming gross share settlement of all shares under the forward agreement, we would have received aggregate proceeds of approximately $644 million, based on maturity forward prices of $64.62 per share for the 2 million shares included in the first tranche and $64.34 per share for the 8 million shares included in the second tranche. We elected to cash settle the first tranche in December 2004 and paid MLI $5.8 million, representing the difference between our share price and the applicable forward sale price, multiplied by the 2 million shares. Additionally, we elected to cash settle 3 million shares of the second tranche in February 2005 and paid MLI $17.4 million. We recorded the settlement payments as a reduction to common stock in our Consolidated Balance Sheets. In April 2005, we entered into an agreement with MLI that extended the settlement date for the remaining 5 million shares of the second tranche to August 2005. In August 2005, we delivered 5 million newly issued shares of our common stock to MLI, and received proceeds of $319.7 million as final settlement of the forward agreement. Credit Ratings Credit ratings are intended to provide banks and capital market participants with a framework for comparing the credit quality of securities and are not a recommendation to buy, sell or hold securities. We believe that the current credit ratings of the Dominion Companies provide sufficient access to the capital markets. However, disruptions in the banking and capital markets not specifically related to us may affect the Dominion Companies ability to access these funding sources or cause an increase in the return required by investors. Both quantitative (financial strength) and qualitative (business or operating characteristics) factors are considered by the credit rating agencies in establishing an individual company credit rating. Credit ratings should be evaluated independently and are subject to revision or withdrawal at any time by the assigning rating organization. The credit ratings for the Dominion Companies are most affected by each company financial profile, mix of regulated and nonregulated businesses and respective cash flows, changes in methodologies used by the rating agencies and event risk, if applicable, such as major acquisitions. Credit ratings for the Dominion Companies as of February 1, 2006 follow: Fitch Moody Standard & Poor Dominion Resources, Inc. Senior unsecured debt securities BBB+ Baa1 BBB Preferred securities of affiliated trusts BBB Baa2 BB+ Commercial paper F2 P-2 A-2 Virginia Power Mortgage bonds A A2 A- Senior unsecured (including tax-exempt) debt securities BBB+ A3 BBB Preferred securities of affiliated trust BBB Baa1 BB+ Preferred stock BBB Baa2 BB+ Commercial paper F2 P-1 A-2 CNG Senior unsecured debt securities BBB+ A3 BBB Preferred securities of affiliated trust BBB Baa1 BB+ Commercial paper F2 P-2 A-2 These credit ratings reflect Standard & Poor December 2005 downgrade of its credit ratings for the Dominion Companies senior unsecured debt securities. Standard & Poor concluded that fuel expenses in excess of rate recovery at Virginia Power and delays in gas and oil production at CNG have caused a deterioration in Dominion financial performance to a level more commensurate with a BBB rating and that there will be no material improvement in Dominion credit profile before midyear 2007. In January 2006, Moody announced that it had placed the credit ratings of the Dominion Companies under review for possible downgrade, citing recent financial performance that was weaker than expected, a decline in funds from operations and higher than expected leverage. Moody review is expected to be completed within three months and will focus on the Dominion 36 Table of Contents Companies expected financial profile over the next 12-18 months. As of February 1, 2006, Fitch Ratings Ltd. (Fitch) and Standard & Poor maintain a stable outlook for their ratings of the Dominion Companies. Generally, a downgrade in an individual company credit rating would not restrict its ability to raise short-term and long-term financing as long as its credit rating remains investment grade, but it would increase the cost of borrowing. We work closely with Fitch, Moody and Standard & Poor with the objective of maintaining our current credit ratings. In order to maintain our current ratings, we may find it necessary to modify our business plans and such changes may adversely affect our growth and earnings per share. Debt Covenants As part of borrowing funds and issuing debt (both short-term and long-term) or preferred securities, the Dominion Companies must enter into enabling agreements. These agreements contain covenants that, in the event of default, could result in the acceleration of principal and interest payments; restrictions on distributions related to our capital stock, including dividends, redemptions, repurchases, liquidation payments or guarantee payments; and in some cases, the termination of credit commitments unless a waiver of such requirements is agreed to by the lenders/security holders. These provisions are customary, with each agreement specifying which covenants apply. These provisions are not necessarily unique to the Dominion Companies. Some of the typical covenants include: The timely payment of principal and interest; Information requirements, including submitting financial reports filed with the SEC to lenders; Performance obligations, audits/inspections, continuation of the basic nature of business, restrictions on certain matters related to merger or consolidation, restrictions on disposition of substantial assets; Compliance with collateral minimums or requirements related to mortgage bonds; and Limitations on liens. We monitor the covenants on a regular basis in order to ensure that events of default will not occur. As of December 31, 2005, there were no events of default under the Dominion Companies covenants. Dividend Restrictions The Public Utility Holding Company Act of 1935 (1935 Act) and related regulations issued by the SEC impose restrictions on the transfer and receipt of funds by a registered holding company from its subsidiaries, including a general prohibition against loans or advances being made by the subsidiaries to benefit the registered holding company. Under the 1935 Act, registered holding companies and their subsidiaries may pay dividends only from retained earnings, unless the SEC specifically authorizes payments from other capital accounts. Our ability to pay dividends on our common stock at declared rates was not impacted by these restrictions during 2005, 2004 and 2003. We will not be bound by the foregoing restrictions on dividends imposed by the 1935 Act after February 8, 2006, the effective date on which the 1935 Act was repealed under the Energy Policy Act of 2005. Future Cash Payments for Contractual Obligations and Planned Capital Expenditures We are party to numerous contracts and arrangements obligating us to make cash payments in future years. These contracts include financing arrangements such as debt agreements and leases, as well as contracts for the purchase of goods and serv ices and financial derivatives. Presented below is a table summarizing cash payments that may result from contracts to which we are a party as of December 31, 2005. For purchase obligations and other liabilities, amounts are based upon contract terms, including fixed and minimum quantities to be purchased at fixed or market-based prices. Actual cash payments will be based upon actual quantities purchased and prices paid and will likely differ from amounts presented below. The table excludes all amounts classified as current liabilities on our Consolidated Balance Sheets, other than current maturities of long-term debt, interest payable, and certain derivative instruments. The majority of our current liabilities will be paid in cash in 2006. Less than 1 year 1-3 years 3-5 years More than 5 years Total (millions) Long-term debt (1) $ 2,330 $ 3,661 $ 1,900 $ 9,179 $ 17,070 Interest payments (2) 1,004 1,557 1,294 7,056 10,911 Leases 131 284 238 345 998 Purchase obligations (3) : Purchased electric capacity for utility operations 441 805 718 2,536 4,500 Fuel to be used for utility operations 772 819 501 640 2,732 Fuel to be used for nonregulated operations 256 44 17 317 Production handling 54 87 36 13 190 Pipeline transportation and storage 92 145 106 93 436 Energy commodity purchases for resale (4) 1,076 283 9 1 1,369 Other 316 198 40 15 569 Other long-term liabilities (5) : Financial derivative commodities (4) 2,566 2,070 2 4,638 Other contractual obligations (6) 74 103 49 32 258 Total cash payments $ 9,112 $ 10,056 $ 4,910 $ 19,910 $ 43,988 (1) Based on stated maturity dates rather than the earlier redemption dates that could be elected by instrument holders. (2) Does not reflect our ability to defer distributions related to our junior subordinated notes payable to affiliated trusts. (3) Amounts exclude open purchase orders for services that are provided on demand, the timing of which cannot be determined. (4) Represents the summation of settlement amounts, by contracts, due from us if all physical or financial transactions among our counterparties and us were liquidated and terminated. (5) Excludes regulatory liabilities, AROs and employee benefit plan obligations that are not contractually fixed as to timing and amount. See Notes 14, 15 and 22 to our Consolidated Financial Statements. Deferred income taxes are also excluded since cash payments are based primarily on taxable income for each discrete fiscal year. (6) Includes interest rate swap agreements. Our planned capital expenditures during 2006 and 2007 are expected to total approximately $3.8 billion and $3.9 billion, respectively. These expenditures are expected to include construction and expansion of generation and LNG facilities, environmental upgrades, construction improvements and expansion of gas and electric transmission and distribution assets, purchases of nuclear fuel and expenditures to explore for and develop natural gas and oil properties. We expect to fund our capital expenditures with cash from operations and a combination of securities issuances and short-term borrowings. We may choose to postpone or cancel certain planned capital expenditures in order to mitigate the need for future debt financings. 37 Table of Contents Use of Off-Balance Sheet Arrangements Forward Equity Transaction As described in Financing Cash Flows and Liquidity Forward Equity Transaction , in September 2004 we entered into a forward equity sale agreement relating to 10 million shares of our common stock. The use of a forward agreement allowed us to avoid equity market uncertainty by pricing a stock offering under then current market conditions, while mitigating share dilution by postponing the issuance of stock until funds were needed. Guarantees We primarily enter into guarantee arrangements on behalf of our consolidated subsidiaries. These arrangements are not subject to the recognition and measurement provisions of FASB Interpretation No. 45, Guarantor Accounting and Disclosure Requirements for Guarantees, Including Indirect Guarantees of Indebtedness of Others. See Note 23 to our Consolidated Financial Statements for further discussion of these guarantees. At December 31, 2005, we have issued $37 million of guarantees to support third parties, equity method investees and employees affected by Hurricane Katrina. In addition, in 2005, we, along with two other gas and oil exploration and production companies, entered into a four-year drilling contract related to a new, ultra-deepwater drilling rig that is expected to be delivered in mid-2008. The contract has a four-year primary term, plus four one-year extension options. Our minimum commitment under the agreement is for approximately $99 million over the four-year term; however, we are jointly and severally liable for up to $394 million to the contractor if the other parties fail to pay the contractor for their obligations under the primary term of the agreement. We view this scenario as highly unlikely and have not recognized any significant liabilities related to any of these arrangements. Leasing Arrangement We have an agreement with a voting interest entity (lessor) to lease the Fairless power station in Pennsylvania, which began commercial operations in June 2004. During construction, we acted as the construction agent for the lessor, controlled the design and construction of the facility and have since been reimbursed for all project costs ($898 million) advanced to the lessor. We make annual lease payments of $53 million. The lease expires in 2013 and at that time, we may renew the lease at negotiated amounts based on original project costs and current market conditions, subject to lessor approval; purchase Fairless at its original construction cost; or sell Fairless, on behalf of the lessor, to an independent third party. If Fairless is sold and the proceeds from the sale are less than its original construction cost, we would be required to make a payment to the lessor in an amount up to 70.75% of original project costs adjusted for certain other costs as specified in the lease. The lease agreement does not contain any provisions that involve credit rating or stock price trigger events. Benefits of this arrangement include: Certain tax benefits as we are considered the owner of the leased property for tax purposes. As a result, we are entitled to tax deductions for depreciation not recognized for financial accounting purposes; and As an operating lease for financial accounting purposes, the asset and related borrowings used to finance the construction of the asset are not included on our Consolidated Balance Sheets. Although this improves measures of leverage calculated using amounts reported in our Consolidated Financial Statements, credit rating agencies view lease obligations as debt equivalents in evaluating our credit profile. Securitizations of Mortgages and Loans As of December 31, 2005, we held $285 million of retained interests from securitizations of mortgage and commercial loans completed in prior years. We did not securitize or originate any loans in 2005 or 2004. Investors in the securitization trusts have no recourse to our other assets for failure of debtors to repay principal and interest on the underlying loans when due. Therefore, our exposure to any future losses from this activity is limited to our investment in the retained interests. Future Issues and Other Matters Gas and Oil Production Due to Hurricanes Katrina and Rita, our production assets in the Gulf of Mexico and, to a lesser extent, South Louisiana were temporarily shut in. Prior to the hurricanes, these assets were producing approximately 435 million cubic feet of natural gas equivalent per day (mmcfed). We had forecasted production increases to approximately 700 mmcfed during October with the addition of four previously announced deepwater projects, plus other planned completion activity. As of mid-January 2006, our Gulf of Mexico and South Louisiana assets were producing approximately 500 mmcfed, however 330 mmcfed of this production was accomplished via temporary measures. The production delays are primarily the result of damage to third-party downstream facilities. The majority of the third-party downstream facilities are projected to become operational by the second quarter of 2006, with the remainder estimated to be on stream by year-end. We expect that the financial impacts of delays in production will be mitigated by business interruption insurance that we maintain for hurricane-related delays in natural gas and oil production. Our business interruption insurance covers delays caused both by damage to our own production facilities and by damage to third-party facilities downstream. Our policy coverage for Hurricane Katrina has a 30-day deductible period and an event limit of $700 million, while our policy for Hurricane Rita has a 45-day deductible period and an event limit of $350 million. Status of Electric Deregulation in Virginia The Virginia Electric Utility Restructuring Act (Virginia Restructuring Act) was enacted in 1999 and established a plan to restructure the electric utility industry in Virginia. The Virginia Restructuring Act addressed, among other things: capped base rates, RTO participation, retail choice, the recovery of stranded costs, and the functional separation of a utility electric generation from its electric transmission and distribution operations. Retail choice has been available to all of our Virginia regulated electric customers since January 1, 2003. We have also separated our generation, distribution and transmission functions through the creation of divisions. State regulatory requirements ensure that our generation and other divisions operate independently and prevent cross-subsidies between generation and other divisions. In 2004, the Virginia Restructuring Act and the Virginia fuel factor statute were amended. The amendments extend capped base rates to December 31, 2010, unless modified or terminated earlier under the Virginia Restructuring Act. The amendments also: Lock in our fuel factor provisions until the earlier of July 1, 2007 or the termination of capped rates under the Virginia Restructuring Act, with no adjustment for previously incurred over-recovery or under-recovery of fuel costs, thus eliminating deferred fuel accounting for the Virginia jurisdiction; Provide for a one-time adjustment of our fuel factor, effective July 1, 2007 through December 31, 2010 (unless capped 38 Table of Contents rates are terminated earlier under the Virginia Restructuring Act), with no adjustment for previously incurred over-recovery or under-recovery of fuel costs; and End wires charges on the earlier of July 1, 2007, or the termination of capped rates. Fuel prices have increased considerably since our Virginia fuel factor provisions were frozen, which has resulted in our fuel expenses being significantly in excess of our rate recovery. We expect that fuel expenses will continue to exceed rate recovery until our fuel factor is adjusted in July 2007. When our fuel factor is adjusted in July 2007, we will remain subject to the risk that fuel factor-related cost recovery shortfalls may adversely affect our margins. Conversely, we could experience a positive economic impact to the extent that we can reduce our fuel factor-related costs for our electric utility generation-related operations. We anticipate that our unhedged natural gas and oil production will act as a natural internal hedge for fuel used in electric generation. If gas and oil prices rise, it is expected that our exploration and production operations will earn greater profits that will help mitigate higher fuel costs and lower profits in our electric utility generation operations. Conversely, if gas and oil prices fall, it is expected that our electric utility generation operations will incur lower fuel costs and earn higher profits that will help mitigate lower profits in our exploration and production operations. We also anticipate that the fixed fuel rate will lessen the impact of weather on our electric utility generation operations. During periods of mild weather it is expected that our electric utility generation operations will burn less high-cost fuel because customers will use less electricity, thereby mitigating decreased revenues. Alternatively, in periods of extreme weather, our higher fuel costs from running costlier plants are expected to be mitigated by additional revenues as customers use more electricity. Other amendments to the Virginia Restructuring Act were also enacted in 2004 with respect to a minimum stay exemption program, a wires charge exemption program and the development of a coal-fired generating plant in southwest Virginia for serving default service needs. Under the minimum stay exemption program, large customers with a load of 500 kilowatts or greater would be exempt from the twelve-month minimum stay obligation under capped rates if they return to supply service from the incumbent utility at market-based pricing after they have switched to supply service with a competitive service provider. The wires charge exemption program would allow large industrial and commercial customers, as well as aggregated customers in all rate classes, to avoid paying wires charges when selecting electricity supply service from a competitive service provider by agreeing to market-based pricing upon return to the incumbent utility. For 2006, our wires charges are set at zero for all rate classes. In February 2005, we joined a consortium to explore the development of a coal-fired electric power station in southwest Virginia. Stranded costs are generation-related costs incurred or commitments made by utilities under cost-based regulation that may not reasonably be expected to be recovered in a competitive market. At December 31, 2005, our exposure to potential stranded costs included long-term power purchase contracts that could ultimately be determined to be above market; generating plants that could possibly become uneconomical in a deregulated environment; and unfunded obligations for nuclear plant decommissioning and postretirement benefits not yet recognized in the financial statements. We believe capped electric retail rates will provide an opportunity to recover our potential stranded costs, depending on market prices of electricity and other factors. Recovery of our potential stranded costs remains subject to numerous risks even in the capped-rate environment. These include, among others, exposure to long-term power purchase commitment losses, future environmental compliance requirements, changes in certain tax laws, nuclear decommissioning costs, increased fuel costs, inflation, increased capital costs and recovery of certain other items. The generation-related cash flows provided by the Virginia Restructuring Act are intended to compensate us for continuing to provide generation services and to allow us to incur costs to restructure our operations during the transition period. As a result, during the transition period, our earnings may increase to the extent that we can reduce operating costs for our utility generation-related operations. Conversely, the same risks affecting the recovery of our stranded costs, may also adversely impact our margins during the transition period. Accordingly, we could realize the negative economic impact of any such adverse event. Using cash flows from operations during the transition period, we may further alter our cost structure or choose to make additional investment in our business. Ohio Energy Choice Pilot Program In April 2005, we filed with the Public Utilities Commission of Ohio (Ohio Commission) a proposal for a two-year pilot program to improve and expand our Energy Choice Program. Under the current structure, non-Energy Choice customers purchase gas directly from us at a monthly gas cost recovery, or GCR, rate that includes true-up adjustments that can change significantly from one quarter to the next. We propose to replace the GCR with a monthly market price that eliminates those adjustments, making it easier for customers to compare and switch to competitive suppliers. A ruling on this proposal is expected by the end of the first quarter of 2006. By the end of the transition period, and subject to Ohio Commission approval, we plan to exit the gas merchant function in Ohio entirely and have all customers select an alternate gas supplier. We will continue to remain the provider of last resort in the event of default by a supplier. Energy Policy Act of 2005 (EPACT) In August 2005, the President of the United States signed EPACT. Key provisions of the Act include the following: Repeal of the 1935 Act in February 2006; Establishment of a self-regulating electric reliability organization governed by an independent board with FERC oversight; Provision for greater regulatory oversight by other federal and state authorities; Extension of the Price Anderson Act for 20 years until 2025; Provision for standby financial support and production tax credits for new nuclear plants; Grant of enhanced merger approval authority to FERC; Provision of authority to FERC for the siting of certain electric transmission facilities if states cannot or will not act in a timely manner; Grant of exclusive authority to FERC to approve applications for construction of LNG facilities; and Improvement of the process for approval and permitting of interstate pipelines. Many of the changes Congress enacted must be implemented through public notice and proposed rule making by the federal agencies affected and this process is ongoing. We will continue to evaluate the effects that EPACT may have on our business. 39 Table of Contents Common Stock Dividend Increase In February 2005, our quarterly dividend rate increased from 66.5 cents per share to 67 cents per share for an annual rate in 2005 of $2.68 per share. Our quarterly dividend rate increased again in January 2006, from 67 cents per share to 69 cents per share for an annual rate in 2006 of $2.76. Our expected cash flow and earnings should enable us to make future annual increases when our Board of Directors deems it financially prudent. The Board of Directors declares common stock dividends on a quarterly basis. Environmental Matters We are subject to costs resulting from a number of federal, state and local laws and regulations designed to protect human health and the environment. These laws and regulations affect future planning and existing operations. They can result in increased capital, operating and other costs as a result of compliance, remediation, containment and monitoring obligations. Historically, we recovered such costs arising from regulated electric operations through utility rates. However, to the extent that environmental costs are incurred in connection with operations regulated by the Virginia Commission, during the period ending December 31, 2010, in excess of the level currently included in the Virginia jurisdictional electric retail rates, our results of operations will decrease. After that date, recovery through regulated rates may be sought for only those environmental costs related to regulated electric transmission and distribution operations and recovery, if any, through the generation component of rates will be dependent upon the market price of electricity. We also may seek recovery through regulated rates for environmental expenditures related to regulated gas transmission and distribution operations. Environmental Protection and Monitoring Expenditures We incurred approximately $205 million, $132 million and $113 million of expenses (including depreciation) during 2005, 2004 and 2003, respectively, in connection with environmental protection and monitoring activities and expect these expenses to be approximately $201 million and $202 million in 2006 and 2007, respectively. In addition, capital expenditures related to environmental controls were $140 million, $94 million and $210 million for 2005, 2004 and 2003, respectively. These expenditures are expected to be approximately $307 million and $278 million for 2006 and 2007, respectively. Clean Air Act Compliance We are required by the Clean Air Act (the Act) to reduce air emissions of various air pollutants that are the by-products of fossil fuel combustion. The Act new Clean Air Interstate Rule and Clean Air Mercury Rule will require significant reductions in future SO 2 , NO X and mercury emissions from our electric generating facilities and will require capital expenditures. The Act existing SO 2 and NO X reduction programs already include: The issuance of a limited number of SO 2 emissions allowances. Each allowance permits the emission of one ton of SO 2 into the atmosphere; NO X emission limitations applicable during the ozone season months of May through September and on an annual average basis; and SO 2 and NO X allowances may be transacted with a third party. Implementation of projects to comply with these SO 2 , NO X and mercury limitations, and other state emission control programs are ongoing and will be influenced by changes in the regulatory environment, availability of allowances and emission control technology. In response to these requirements, we estimate that we will make capital expenditures at our affected generating facilities of approximately $1.1 billion during the period 2006 through 2010. Other As part of its review of our request related to the reissuance of a pollution discharge elimination permit for the Millstone Power Station, the Connecticut Department of Environmental Protection is evaluating the ecological impacts of the cooling water intake system. Until the permit is reissued, it is not possible to predict the financial impact that may result. In October 2003, the Environmental Protection Agency (EPA) and the Massachusetts Department of Environmental Protection (DEP) each issued new National Pollutant Discharge Elimination System permits for the Brayton Point Power Station. The new permits contained identical conditions that in effect require the installation of cooling towers to address concerns over the withdrawal and discharge of cooling water. In November 2003, appeals were filed with the EPA Environmental Appeals Board (EAB) and the Division of Administrative Law Appeals in Massachusetts, and both permits were stayed. In February 2006 the EAB remanded a portion of EPA permit to EPA for reconsideration. The DEP permit is still stayed pending the outcome of the EPA process. Until the remand and any resulting appeals are completed, the outcome cannot be predicted. Future Environmental Regulations The U.S. Congress is considering various legislative proposals that would require generating facilities to comply with more stringent air emissions standards. Emission reduction requirements under consideration would be phased in under a variety of periods of up to 15 years. If these new proposals are adopted, additional significant expenditures may be required. In 1997, the United States signed an international Protocol to limit man-made greenhouse emissions under the United Nations Framework Convention on Climate Change. However, the Protocol will not become binding unless approved by the U.S. Senate. Currently, the Bush Administration has indicated that it will not pursue ratification of the Protocol and has set a voluntary goal of reducing the nation greenhouse gas emission intensity by 18% over the period 2002-2012. Several legislative proposals that include provisions seeking to impose mandatory reductions of greenhouse gas emissions are under consideration in the United States Congress. The cost of compliance with the Protocol or other mandatory greenhouse gas reduction obligations could be significant. Given the highly uncertain outcome and timing of future action, if any, by the U.S. federal government on this issue, we cannot predict the financial impact of future climate change actions on our operations at this time. 40 Table of Contents Restructuring of Contracts with Nonutility Generator In October 2005, we reached an agreement in principle to restructure three long-term power purchase contracts. The restructured contracts expire between 2015 and 2017 and are expected to reduce capacity and energy payments by approximately $44 million and $6 million, respectively, over the remaining term of the contracts. The transaction became effective in February 2006 and did not result in a cash outlay or charge to earnings. Sale of Gas Distribution Subsidiaries On March 1, 2006 we entered into an agreement with Equitable Resources, Inc. to sell two of our wholly-owned regulated gas distribution subsidiaries, The Peoples Natural Gas Company and Hope Gas, Inc., for $969.6 million plus adjustments to reflect capital expenditures and changes in working capital. We expect to complete the transaction by the first quarter of 2007, subject to state regulatory approvals in Pennsylvania and West Virginia as well as approval under the federal Hart-Scott-Rodino Act.
