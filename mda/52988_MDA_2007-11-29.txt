Item 7. MANAGEMENT S DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS OF FINANCIAL CONDITION AND RESULTS OF OPERATIONS The purpose of this Management Discussion and Analysis (MD&A) is to provide an overview of the Company consolidated financial condition and results of operations as well as an analysis of the factors that caused certain key elements of our financial statements to change from one year to the next. In this MD&A, we use certain terms and abbreviations that are defined as follows: AICPA The American Institute of Certified Public Accountants (like the APB and the FASB, the accounting guidance promulgated by the AICPA are part of the authoritative accounting literature comprising generally accepted accounting principles in the U.S.). APB Accounting Principles Board. Backlog Backlog represents the total dollar amount of revenues we expect to record in the future as a result of performing work under contracts that have been awarded to us. With respect to operations and maintenance (O&M) contracts, however, we include in backlog the amount of revenues we expect to receive for only one succeeding year, regardless of the remaining life of the contract. For national government programs (other than U.S. federal O&M contracts), our policy is to include in backlog the full contract award, whether funded or unfunded, excluding option periods. SG&A expenses From our Consolidated Statements of Earnings, SG&A expenses means selling, general and administrative expenses. Operating profit From our Consolidated Statements of Earnings, operating profit means revenues, less direct costs of contracts and SG&A expenses. SFAS Statement of Financial Accounting Standards (these are accounting standards adopted by the Financial Accounting Standards Board (FASB)). Overview Net earnings in fiscal 2007 increased by $90.2 million, or 45.8%, as compared to last year, and EPS (diluted) grew by 43.3%. Contributing to the growth in net earnings was increased activity on contracts with clients in a number of industries and markets including: energy and refining-downstream; upstream oil and gas; national government programs; and chemicals and polymers. Project Services revenues increased by $933.9 million, or 32.3%, in fiscal 2007 as compared to last year. Project Services consist of engineering, design, architectural, and other home office services that typically bring higher gross margin rates as compared to our field services . Cash and cash equivalents totaled $613.4 million at September 30, 2007; an increase of $179.3 million, or 41.3%, as compared to September 30, 2006. Our net cash position (defined as cash and cash equivalents less bank debt) was $572.4 million at September 30, 2007; an increase of $230.5 million, or 67.4%, as compared to September 30, 2006. Additions to property and equipment used $64.6 million of cash and cash equivalents during fiscal 2007 as compared to $54.0 million last year. Our cash balances, combined with a borrowing capacity of $290.0 million under our long-term, unsecured revolving credit facility, provide sufficient capital resources for us to fund our on-going operations. 29 Table of Contents Critical Accounting Policies In order to understand better the changes that may occur to key elements of our financial condition and operating results, a reader of this MD&A should be aware of the critical accounting policies we apply in preparing our consolidated financial statements. The consolidated financial statements contained in this report were prepared in accordance with accounting principles generally accepted in the United States. The preparation of our consolidated financial statements and the financial statements of any business performing long-term engineering and construction-type contracts requires management to make certain estimates and judgments that affect both the entity results of operations and the carrying values of its assets and liabilities. Although our significant accounting polices are described in Note 2 of the Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements, the following discussion is intended to describe those accounting policies that are especially critical to the preparation of our consolidated financial statements. Revenue Accounting for Contracts and Use of Joint Ventures In accounting for long-term engineering and construction-type contracts, we follow the provisions of the AICPA Statement of Position 81-1 Accounting for Performance of Construction-Type and Certain Production-Type Contracts . In general, we recognize revenues at the time we provide services. Depending on the commercial terms of the contract, we recognize revenues either when costs are incurred, or using the percentage-of-completion method of accounting by relating contract costs incurred to date to the total estimated costs at completion. This method of revenue recognition requires us to prepare estimates of costs to complete contracts in progress. In making such estimates, judgments are required to evaluate contingencies such as potential variances in schedule, the cost of materials and labor, and productivity, and the impact of change orders, liability claims, contract disputes, and achievement of contractual performance standards. Many of our engineering and construction contracts provide for reimbursement of costs plus a fixed or percentage fee. In some of the markets we serve there is an increasing trend towards cost-reimbursable contracts with incentive-fee arrangements. In certain instances, we base our incentive fees on achievement of target completion dates, target costs, and/or other performance criteria. Failure to meet these targets or increases in contract costs can result in unrealized incentive fees or non-recoverable costs, which could exceed revenues recognized from the project. One such incentive-fee contract is with the U.S. Department of Energy for the Fernald Closure Project (the Fernald Project ). This contract provides for incentive fees based on schedule and cost. In addition, the terms of the contract provide that the incentive fees may not be fully billed to the DOE until the completion of the project, which we estimate to occur in fiscal 2008. At September 30, 2007 and 2006 there was $5.4 million and $40.0 million, respectively, of fees relating to the Fernald Project recognized as receivables in our Consolidated Balance Sheets. We provide for contract losses in their entirety in the period they become known, without regard to the percentage of completion. The nature of our business sometimes results in clients, subcontractors or vendors presenting claims to us for recovery of costs they incurred in excess of what they expected to incur, or for which they believe they are not contractually responsible. In those situations where a claim against us may result in additional costs to the contract, we would include in the total estimated costs of the contract (and therefore, the estimated amount of margin to be earned under the contract) an estimate, based on all relevant facts and circumstances available, of the additional costs to be incurred. Similarly, and in the normal course of business, we may present claims to our clients for costs we have incurred for which we believe we are not contractually responsible. In those situations where we have presented such claims to our clients, we include in revenues the amount of costs incurred, without profit, to the extent it is probable that the claims will result in additional contract revenue, and the amount of such additional revenue can be reliably estimated. Costs associated with unapproved change orders are included in revenues using substantially the same criteria used for claims. Certain cost-reimbursable contracts with government customers as well as certain commercial clients provide that contract costs are subject to audit and adjustment. In this situation, revenues are recorded at the time services are performed based upon the amounts we expect to realize upon completion of the contracts. In those situations where an audit indicates that we may have billed a client for costs not allowable under the terms of the contract, we estimate the amount of such nonbillable costs and adjust our revenues accordingly. 30 Table of Contents As is common in the industry, we execute certain contracts jointly with third parties through various forms of joint ventures and consortiums. For certain of these joint ventures (i.e., where we have an undivided interest in the assets and liabilities of the venture), we recognize our proportionate share of joint venture revenues, costs and operating profit in our Consolidated Statements of Earnings. For other investments in engineering and construction joint ventures, we use the equity method of accounting. Accounting for Stock Issued to Employees and Others Effective October 1, 2005, we began accounting for stock issued to employees and outside directors in accordance with the provisions of SFAS No. 123R Share-Based Payment. SFAS 123R superseded APB Opinion No. 25 Accounting for Stock Issued to Employees and requires that we measure the value of services received in exchange for an award of an equity instrument based on the grant-date fair value of the award. The computed fair value is recognized as a non-cash cost over the period the employee provides services. We use the Black-Scholes option pricing model to compute the grant date fair value of the award. The Black-Scholes model requires the use of highly subjective assumptions in order to compute the hypothetical, fair value of a stock option. Changes in these assumptions can cause drastically different values being assigned to a stock option. The value assigned to any stock options that may be awarded in the future as well as the related expense associated with any such awards will be dependent on the assumptions used. Accounting for Pension Plans In accounting for pension plans, we follow the provisions of SFAS No. 87 Employers Accounting for Pensions , and SFAS No. 158 Employers Accounting for Defined Benefit Pension and Other Postretirement Plans. SFAS 87 requires the use of assumptions and estimates in order to calculate periodic pension cost, and the value of the plans assets and liabilities. These assumptions involve discount rates, investment returns, and projected salary increases, among others. We rely on qualified actuaries to assist us in valuing the financial position of the plans, and to provide advice regarding the actuarial assumptions used. The expected rates of return on plan assets for fiscal 2007 ranged from 5.0% to 9.0%, which is unchanged from last year. We believe this range of rates reflects the long-term returns expected on the plans assets, considering projected rates of inflation, the diversification of the plans assets, and the expected real rates of market returns. The discount rates used to compute plan liabilities were changed from a range of 4.75% to 6.25% in fiscal 2006 to a range of 5.20% to 5.75% in fiscal 2007. Changes in the actuarial assumptions may have a material affect on the plans assets and liabilities, and the associated pension expense. Management, together with our actuaries, monitor trends in the marketplace within which our pension plans operate in order to assure the fairness of the actuarial assumptions used. In September 2006, the FASB issued SFAS 158. SFAS 158 requires companies to (i) recognize the funded statuses of their single-employer, defined benefit postretirement plans as assets or liabilities in their balance sheets; (ii) recognize as a component of other comprehensive income, net of tax, the gains or losses that arise during the period being reported but are not recognized as a component of periodic benefit cost under existing accounting rules; and (iii) measure defined benefit pension plan assets and obligations as of the date of the sponsor balance sheet. In fiscal 2007, we were required to initially recognize the funded statuses of our defined benefit pension plans in our consolidated balance sheet which resulted in a $45.0 million after-tax gain in accumulated other comprehensive income. The other provisions of SFAS 158 (relating to the change in measurement date of the plans assets and liabilities) is effective for fiscal years ending after December 15, 2008 (i.e., September 30, 2009 for us). The change in measurement date is not expected to have a material effect on our consolidated financial statements Accounting for Income Taxes We account for income taxes in accordance with SFAS No. 109 Accounting for Income Taxes , and other, applicable authoritative pronouncements. Judgment is required in determining our worldwide provision for income taxes. In the normal course of business, we may engage in numerous transactions every day for which the ultimate tax outcome (including the period in which the transaction will ultimately be included in taxable income or deducted as an expense) is uncertain. Additionally, the tax returns we file are subject to audit and investigation by the Internal Revenue Service, most states in the 31 Table of Contents United States, and by various government agencies representing many jurisdictions outside the United States. Our effective tax rate was 36.0% in fiscal 2007, 35.5% in fiscal 2006 and 37.2% in fiscal 2005. We routinely monitor the appropriateness of our worldwide tax rate, and we adjust our income tax expense in the period it is probable that actual results will differ from our estimates. In July 2006, the FASB issued Interpretation No. 48 Accounting for Uncertainty in Income Taxes, an Interpretation of FASB Statement No. 109 . FIN 48 clarifies the accounting for uncertainty in income taxes recognized in a company financial statements in accordance with SFAS 109. FIN 48 prescribes a recognition threshold and measurement attribute for financial statement disclosure of tax positions taken, or expected to be taken, on an entity tax return. FIN 48 also provides guidance on derecognition; classification; interest and penalties; accounting in interim periods; disclosure and transition. FIN 48 is effective for fiscal years beginning after December 15, 2006 (i.e., fiscal 2008 for us). We continue to evaluate the impact of FIN 48 but do not expect the adoption to have a material effect on our consolidated financial statements. Insurance Matters, Litigation, Claims, and Contingencies In the normal course of business, we are subject to certain contractual guarantees and litigation. The guarantees to which we are a party generally relate to project schedules and plant performance. Most of the litigation involves us as a defendant in workers compensation; personal injury; environmental; employment/labor; professional liability; and other similar lawsuits. We maintain insurance coverage for various aspects of our business and operations. We have elected, however, to retain a portion of losses that occur through the use of various deductibles, limits, and retentions under our insurance programs. This situation may subject us to some future liability for which we are only partially insured, or completely uninsured. We intend to mitigate any such future liability by continuing to exercise prudent business judgment in negotiating the terms and conditions of our contracts. In accordance with SFAS No. 5 Accounting for Contingencies , we record in our Consolidated Balance Sheets amounts representing our estimated liability relating to such claims, guarantees, litigation, and audits and investigations. We rely on qualified actuaries to assist us in determining the level of reserves to establish for insurance-related claims that are known and have been asserted against us, and for insurance-related claims that are believed to have been incurred based on actuarial analysis, but have not yet been reported to our claims administrators as of the respective balance sheet dates. We include any adjustments to such insurance reserves in our consolidated results of operations. In addition, as a contractor providing services to various agencies of the United States federal government, we are subject to many levels of audits, investigations, and claims by, or on behalf of, the U.S. federal government with respect to contract performance, pricing, costs, cost allocations, and procurement practices. Testing Goodwill for Impairment In accordance with SFAS No. 142 Goodwill and Other Intangible Assets , the amount of goodwill carried in our Consolidated Balance Sheets is tested annually for possible impairment. In conducting the impairment test, we may apply, in accordance with the provisions of SFAS 142, various valuation techniques to estimate the fair value of our reporting units. The values resulting from the application of these valuation techniques are not necessarily representative of the values we might obtain in a sale of our reporting units to a willing third party. Foreign Currencies We transact business in various currencies. The functional currency of each of our foreign operations is the currency of the local country. Consequently, and in accordance with SFAS No. 52 Foreign Currency Translation , revenues and expenses of operations outside the United States are translated into U.S. dollars using weighted-average exchange rates for the applicable period(s) being translated while the assets and liabilities of operations outside the United States are translated into U.S. dollars using period-end exchange rates. The net effect of the foreign currency translation process (translating the income statement accounts at rates that are different from those used to translate the balance sheet accounts) is included in stockholders equity as a component of accumulated other comprehensive income in the accompanying Consolidated Balance Sheets. Our net exposure to foreign currency transaction gains and losses is limited because, in general, our various operations invoice clients and satisfy their financial obligations in their respective functional currencies. In 32 Table of Contents situations where our operations incur contract costs in currencies other than their functional currencies, we strive to have a portion of the related contract revenues denominated in the same currencies as the costs. In those situations where revenues and costs are transacted in different currencies, we sometimes enter into foreign exchange contracts in order to limit our exposure to fluctuating foreign currencies. In those situations, we follow the provisions of SFAS No. 133 Accounting for Derivative Instruments and Hedging Activities in accounting for our derivative contracts. Results of Operations General Our business focuses exclusively on providing technical, professional, and construction services to a large number of industrial, commercial, and governmental clients around the world. The services we provide generally fall into four broad categories: Project Services (which includes engineering, design, architectural, and similar services); Process, Scientific, and Systems Consulting services (which includes services performed in connection with a wide variety of scientific testing, analysis, and consulting activities); Construction services (which encompasses traditional field construction services as well as modular construction activities, and includes direct-hire construction and construction management services); and Operations and Maintenance services (which includes services performed in connection with operating large, complex facilities on behalf of clients as well as services involving process plant maintenance). The scope of services we can provide our clients, therefore, ranges from consulting and conceptual design services (which are often required by clients in the very early stages of a project) to complete, single-responsibility, design-build-operate contracts. The following table sets forth our revenues by type of service for each year ended September 30 (in thousands): 2007 2006 2005 Technical Professional Services Revenues: Project Services $ 3,828,179 $ 2,894,293 $ 2,469,879 Process, Scientific, and Systems Consulting 597,116 482,344 385,700 Total Technical Professional Services Revenues 4,425,295 3,376,637 2,855,579 Field Services Revenues: Construction 2,990,177 3,239,613 1,884,066 Operations and Maintenance 1,058,498 805,020 895,356 Total Field Services Revenues 4,048,675 4,044,633 2,779,422 $ 8,473,970 $ 7,421,270 $ 5,635,001 33 Table of Contents We focus our services on clients operating in certain industry groups and markets. We believe these industry groups and markets have sufficient common needs to permit cross-utilization of our resources. The following table sets forth our revenues by these industry groups and markets for each year ended September 30 (in thousands): 2007 2006 2005 Energy & Refining Downstream (a) $ 2,520,064 $ 2,255,928 $ 1,637,675 National Government Programs 1,500,007 1,259,361 1,160,664 Chemicals and Polymers 1,238,350 1,124,254 737,872 Oil & Gas Upstream (a) 890,943 546,663 319,796 Pharmaceuticals and Biotechnology 756,178 678,989 514,836 Infrastructure 681,367 546,999 464,400 Buildings 437,122 395,190 462,147 Industrial and Other (b) 449,939 613,886 337,611 $ 8,473,970 $ 7,421,270 $ 5,635,001 (a) In prior annual reports, these amounts were combined into one category called Oil & Gas and Refining . Prior year information has been reclassified to conform to the fiscal 2007 presentation. (b) Includes projects for our clients operating in the technology and manufacturing; pulp and paper; food and consumer products; and basic resources industries, among others. Fiscal 2007 Compared to Fiscal 2006 We recorded net earnings of $287.1 million, or $2.35 per diluted share, for fiscal year ended September 30, 2007, compared to net earnings of $196.9 million, or $1.64 per diluted share for fiscal 2006. Total revenues for fiscal 2007 increased by $1.1 billion, or 14.2%, to $8.5 billion, compared to total revenues of $7.4 billion for fiscal 2006. Revenues increased among most of the industry groups and markets we serve, lead by a combined, $608.4 million increase, or 21.7%, in revenues from clients operating in the energy and refining, and the upstream oil and gas industries. Also contributing to the revenue growth in fiscal 2007 were a $240.6 million increase, or 19.1%, in revenues from projects for our national government programs clients; a $114.1 million increase, or 10.1%, in revenues from projects for our clients operating in the chemicals and polymers industries; and a $134.4 million increase, or 24.6%, in revenues from projects for our infrastructure clients. With respect to projects for our clients operating in the oil & gas and refining industries, revenue from the downstream sector grew by $264.1 million, or 11.7%, from last year. Most of this increase continues to relate to higher capital spending on projects involving the reconfiguration and expansion of existing refineries, and addressing the effects of changing crude inputs from lighter crudes to heavier crudes that contain slightly higher levels of sulfur. More recently, we have seen increased capital spending by many of our refinery clients involving projects driven by government regulations. These include projects to comply with the nonroad diesel emission and other similar standards. Revenue from the upstream sector of the oil & gas and refining industries grew by $344.3 million, or 63.0%, from last year. We continued to see a high level of spending in fiscal 2007 by our clients on oil and gas extraction projects, particularly in the oil sands area of Canada. Revenues from projects for our national government programs clients increased by $240.6 million, or 19.1%, from last year. Most of the increase was due to higher levels of revenue from the U.S. federal government relating to various aerospace and defense projects. Revenues from projects for our clients in the chemicals and polymers industries increased by $114.1 million, or 10.1%, due to continued demand to increase production capacity. Revenues from projects performed for our infrastructure clients increased by $134.4 million, or 24.6%, 34 Table of Contents from last year. Part of the increase was due to the acquisition of Edwards and Kelcey, Inc. (Edwards and Kelcey) in April 2007. Edwards and Kelcey contributed $67.2 million in revenues during fiscal 2007. The balance of the increase in infrastructure revenues was due to higher spending by clients on projects for improved roads, highways, and bridges. Included in the above increase in revenues was a $66.0 million increase in pass-through costs. Pass through costs totaled $2,746.7 million in fiscal 2007 compared to $2,680.7 million in fiscal 2006. When we are responsible for subcontract labor or third-party materials and equipment, we reflect the costs of such items in both revenues and costs. The level of pass-through costs included in revenues and costs will vary between reporting periods depending principally on the amount of procurement that clients choose to do themselves, as opposed to using our services, as well as on the normal ramping-up (and winding-down) of field services activities on construction and O&M projects. Pass through costs as a percentage of field services revenues in fiscal 2007 and 2006 were essentially unchanged. As a percentage of revenues, direct costs of contracts were 85.7% for fiscal 2007, compared to 87.4% for fiscal 2006 (for the remainder of this MD&A, we refer to this percentage relationship as the DC% ). The relationship between direct costs of contracts and revenues will fluctuate between reporting periods depending on a variety of factors including the mix of business during the reporting periods being compared as well as the level of margins earned from the various types of services provided. Generally speaking, the more procurement we do on behalf of our clients (i.e., where we purchase equipment and materials for use on projects, and/or procure subcontracts in connection with projects) and the more field services revenues we have relative to technical, professional services revenues, the higher the DC% will be. Because pass-through costs typically generate lower margins, it is not unusual for us to experience an increase or decrease in revenues relating to pass-through costs without experiencing a corresponding increase or decrease in our gross margins and operating profit. The decrease in the DC% in fiscal 2007 as compared to last year was due primarily to the increase in technical professional services revenues relative to field services revenues. Also contributing to the decrease in the DC% was a slight increase in the margin rates earned on our technical professional services revenues. SG&A expenses for fiscal 2007 increased by $136.7 million, or 21.6%, to $769.4 million, compared to $632.7 million for fiscal 2006. The increase in SG&A expenses was due almost entirely to the business growth we experienced in fiscal 2007, particularly in support of the technical professional services area of our business. Generally speaking, such services require higher labor and facilities costs in order to support those activities. Also contributing to the increase in SG&A expenses was the acquisition of Edwards and Kelcey, which contributed $22.8 million of SG&A expenses in fiscal 2007. Operating profit for fiscal 2007 increased by $140.4 million, or 46.6%, to $442.0 million, compared to $301.6 million for fiscal 2006. As a percentage of revenues, operating profit was 5.2% for fiscal 2007 compared to 4.1% in fiscal 2006. The increase in operating profit during fiscal 2007 as compared to last year was due primarily to the increase in technical professional services revenues; the improvement in our level of SG&A expenses relative to technical professional services revenues; and a slight improvement in the margin rates earned on our technical professional services revenues. Interest income for fiscal 2007 increased by $4.6 million, or 29.9%, to $19.8 million, compared to $15.2 million for fiscal 2006. The increase in interest income was due primarily to higher average cash balances on deposit during fiscal 2007 as compared to last year combined with a slight increase in the rate of interest earned on our deposits. We recorded income tax expense of $161.5 million during fiscal 2007, compared to $108.4 million during fiscal 2006. Our overall effective tax rate was 36.0% for fiscal 2007 compared to 35.5% last year. The Company overall effective tax rate for fiscal 2006 was positively affected by the favorable settlement of a matter with the U.S. Internal Revenue Service (IRS), off-set in part by provisions recorded for certain other income tax exposures. The net effect of the IRS settlement and the other income tax exposures was a net reduction of $1.5 million to the fiscal 2006 total tax expense. In the normal course of our business, we may 35 Table of Contents engage in numerous transactions for which the ultimate tax outcome (including the period in which the transaction will ultimately be included in income or deducted as an expense) is uncertain. Additionally, we file income, franchise, gross receipts and similar tax returns in many jurisdictions. Our tax returns are subject to audit and investigation by the Internal Revenue Service, most states in the United States, and by various government agencies representing many jurisdictions outside the United States. We continually monitor the appropriateness of the rate, and we adjust our income tax expense in the period it is probable that actual results will change. Fiscal 2006 Compared to Fiscal 2005 We recorded net earnings of $196.9 million, or $1.64 per diluted share, for fiscal year ended September 30, 2006, compared to net earnings of $131.6 million, or $1.12 per diluted share for fiscal 2005. Total revenues for fiscal 2006 increased by $1.8 billion, or 31.7%, to $7.4 billion, compared to total revenues of $5.6 billion for fiscal 2005. Revenues increased among most of the industry groups and markets we serve, lead by a 52.4% increase in revenues from clients operating in the chemicals and polymers markets, and a 43.2% increase in revenues from clients operating in the energy and refining-downstream industries. The increase in revenues from clients operating in the chemicals and polymers markets was driven by demand by a number of our clients to increase capacity. The increase in revenues from our clients operating in the oil & gas and refining industries was due primarily to new and continuing projects reconfiguring existing refineries in order to increase production and address the effects of changing crude inputs from lighter crudes to heavier crudes that contain slightly higher levels of sulfur. Also contributing to the increase in revenues were new awards in the oil & gas upstream market relating to oil sands extraction projects, as well as a $1,145.2 million increase in pass-through costs. The increase in pass-through costs from fiscal 2005 to 2006 was consistent with the overall increase in field services revenues. The DC% was 87.4% for fiscal 2006, compared to 85.7% for fiscal 2005. The increase in the DC% in fiscal 2006 from fiscal 2005 was due to the increase in field services activity combined with slightly lower fees from our technical professional services revenues, off-set in part by slightly higher fees from field services. We were successful in keeping SG&A growth in-line with our increased business activity during fiscal 2006. SG&A expenses during fiscal 2006 increased by $41.3 million, or 7.0%, to $632.7 million, compared to $591.4 million during fiscal 2005. Contributing to the increase in SG&A expenses was increased professional technical services activity and the effects of foreign currency translation. SG&A expense as a percentage of revenue decreased from 10.5% in fiscal 2005 to 8.5% in fiscal 2006. SG&A expense as a percentage of gross margin decreased from 73.3% in fiscal 2005 to 67.7% in fiscal 2006. Contributing to the decrease in these relationships is the result of increased field services activity, which generally requires less SG&A expense to support. Operating profit for fiscal 2006 increased by $86.7 million, or 40.3%, to $301.6 million, compared to $214.9 million during fiscal 2005. The increase in operating profit during fiscal 2006 as compared to fiscal 2005 was due to the overall increase in business activity. As a percentage of revenues, operating profit was 4.1% for fiscal 2006 compared to 3.8% in fiscal 2005. Notwithstanding the increase in the direct costs of contracts as a percentage of revenue, the Company was able to increase its operating profit by limiting the increase in SG&A expenses. Interest income increased by $10.9 million to $15.2 million during fiscal 2006, compared to $4.3 million of interest income during fiscal 2005. Included in interest income for fiscal 2006 is $3.3 million relating to the favorable settlement of a matter with the IRS (discussed below). The balance of the increase in interest income was a result of higher cash balances on deposit during fiscal 2006 as compared to fiscal 2005. Interest expense increased by $1.0 million to $7.5 million during fiscal 2006, compared to $6.5 million of interest expense during fiscal 2005. The increase in interest expense is due primarily to higher levels of borrowing by our operations outside the U.S. (in support of the growth in business) combined with slightly higher interest rates. 36 Table of Contents We recorded income tax expense of $108.4 million during fiscal 2006, compared to $77.9 million during fiscal 2005. Our overall effective tax rate was 35.5% during fiscal 2006 compared to 37.2% for fiscal 2005. The overall effective tax rate for fiscal 2006 was impacted by the favorable settlement of a matter with the IRS, off-set in part by provisions recorded for certain other income tax exposures. The net effect of the IRS settlement and the other income tax exposures was a net reduction to the Company income tax expense of $1.5 million. Impacting the overall effective tax rate for fiscal 2005 was certain stock-based compensation expense amounts relating to the Company employee stock purchase plans where no tax benefit was available to the Company. In the normal course of our business, we may engage in numerous transactions for which the ultimate tax outcome (including the period in which the transaction will ultimately be included in income or deducted as an expense) is uncertain. Additionally, we file income, franchise, gross receipts and similar tax returns in many jurisdictions. Our tax returns are subject to audit and investigation by the Internal Revenue Service, most states in the United States, and by various government agencies representing many jurisdictions outside the United States. We continually monitor the appropriateness of the rate, and we adjust our income tax expense in the period it is probable that actual results will change. Contractual Obligations The following table sets forth certain information about our contractual obligations as of September 30, 2007 (in thousands): Payments Due by Fiscal Period Total 1 Year or Less 2 - 3 Years 4 - 5 Years More than 5 Years Long-term debt obligations $ 40,450 $ $ $ 40,450 $ Operating leases (a) 557,678 111,230 179,913 138,512 128,023 Obligations under defined benefit pension plans (b) 107,852 27,188 57,682 22,982 Obligations under nonqualified deferred compensation plans (c) 73,172 5,592 11,864 12,833 42,883 Purchase obligations (d) 858,794 858,794 Total $ 1,637,946 $ 1,002,804 $ 249,459 $ 214,777 $ 170,906 (a) Assumes the Company will make end of lease term residual value guarantee payments of $35.3 million in 2011 and $38.8 million in 2015 with respect to the lease of two office buildings in Houston, Texas. (b) Assumes that future contributions will be consistent with amounts projected to be contributed in fiscal 2008, allowing for certain growth based on rates of inflation and salary increases, but limited to the amount recorded as of September 30, 2007. Actual contributions will depend on a variety of factors, including amounts required by local laws and regulations, and other funding requirements. (c) Assumes that future payments will be consistent with amounts paid in fiscal 2007, allowing for certain growth. Due to the nonqualified nature of the plans, and the fact that benefits are based in part on years of service, the payments included in the schedule were limited to the amount recorded as of September 30, 2007. (d) Represents those liabilities estimated to be under firm contractual commitments as of September 30, 2007. Backlog The following table summarizes our backlog at September 30, 2007, 2006, and 2005 (in millions): 2007 2006 2005 Technical professional services $ 6,188.5 $ 5,153.4 $ 4,329.0 Field services 7,397.3 4,624.3 4,314.0 Total $ 13,585.8 $ 9,777.7 $ 8,643.0 37 Table of Contents Because the entire value of contracts is added to backlog as soon as the contracts are awarded to us (rather than adding the contracts to backlog gradually over time), and many of our contracts require us to provide services that span over a number of fiscal quarters (and sometimes over fiscal years), we evaluate our backlog on a year-over-year basis, rather than on a sequential, quarter-over-quarter basis. Our backlog at September 30, 2007 increased by $3.8 billion, or 38.9%, to $13.6 billion from $9.8 billion at September 30, 2006. The increase in backlog during fiscal 2007 was attributable primarily to new awards from clients operating in the upstream oil & gas, and downstream energy and refining industries. In accordance with industry practice, substantially all of our contracts are subject to cancellation or termination at the discretion of the client. However, we have not experienced cancellations that have had a material effect on the reported backlog amounts. In a situation where a client terminates a contract, we would ordinarily be entitled to receive payment for work performed up to the date of termination and, in certain instances, we may be entitled to allowable termination and cancellation costs. While management uses all information available to it to determine backlog, our backlog at any given time is subject to changes in the scope of services to be provided as well as increases or decreases in costs relating to the contracts included therein. Total backlog at September 30, 2007 included approximately $2.2 billion, or 16.5% of total backlog, relating to work to be performed either directly or indirectly for the U.S. federal government and its agencies. This compares to approximately $2.2 billion, or 22.3% of total backlog, and $2.2 billion, or 25.3% of total backlog, of U.S. federal backlog at September 30, 2006 and 2005, respectively. Most of our federal contracts require that services be provided beyond one year. In general, these contracts must be funded annually (i.e., the amounts to be spent under the contract must be appropriated by the U.S. Congress to the procuring agency, and then the agency must allot these sums to the specific contracts). Subject to the factors discussed in Item 1A Risk Factors , above, we estimate that approximately $7.7 billion, or 56.5%, of total backlog at September 30, 2007 will be realized as revenues within the next fiscal year. Effects of Inflation Refer to Item 1A Risk Factors , above. Liquidity and Capital Resources We finance our operations primarily through cash provided by operations. At September 30, 2007, our principal source of liquidity consisted of $613.4 million of cash and cash equivalents, and $249.6 million of available capacity under our $290.0 million unsecured, revolving credit facility discussed below. During fiscal 2007, our cash and cash equivalents increased by $179.3 million, to $613.4 million. This compares to an increase in cash and cash equivalents of $194.2 million during fiscal 2006, and an increase of $139.8 million during fiscal 2005. During fiscal 2007, we experienced net cash inflows from operating activities of $360.9 million. Additionally, we experienced a $4.5 million increase resulting from changes in exchange rates during fiscal 2007. These inflows were offset in part by net cash outflows from investing activities and financing activities of $165.8 million and $20.3 million respectively. Our operations provided net cash of $360.9 million during fiscal 2007. This compares to net cash inflows of $223.5 million and $150.3 million during fiscal 2006 and 2005, respectively. The $137.3 million increase in cash provided by operations in fiscal 2007 as compared to fiscal 2006 was due primarily to a $90.2 million increase in net earnings, a $53.4 million increase relating to the timing of cash receipts and payments within our working capital accounts, and increases in certain non-cash items including an increase of $9.1 million in depreciation and amortization of property, equipment and improvements, and a $0.8 million increase in stock-based compensation. These increases in cash flows from operations were offset in part by the effects of a $1.2 million change in deferred income taxes, a $13.0 million change in the excess tax benefits relating to stock based compensation, and a $1.7 million decrease in amortization of intangible assets. 38 Table of Contents We used $165.8 million of cash and cash equivalents for investing activities during fiscal 2007. This compares to net cash outflow of $67.6 million and $68.3 million during fiscal 2006 and 2005 respectively. The $98.2 million increase in cash used for investing activities as compared to fiscal 2006 was due primarily to an additional $77.8 million of cash used for acquisitions of businesses. Also contributing to the increase in cash used for investing activities in fiscal 2007 as compared to fiscal 2006 was an additional $10.6 million of cash used for purchases of property and equipment, and a $10.9 million increase in miscellaneous, non-current assets. We used $88.7 million of cash for acquisitions of businesses during fiscal 2007. Included in this amount is cash used to complete the acquisitions of Edwards & Kelcey, W.H. Linder & Associates, Inc., and John F. Brown. Also included in this amount is cash used to acquire all of the minority interest of Jacobs Engineering India Pvt. Ltd. Our financing activities resulted in net cash outflows of $20.3 million during fiscal 2007. This compares to net cash inflows of $48.3 million and $60.7 million during fiscal 2006 and 2005, respectively. The $68.6 million decrease in cash flows from financing activities during fiscal 2007 as compared to fiscal 2006 was due primarily to a more aggressive strategy in fiscal 2007 of paying-down debt which resulted in an additional use of cash of $46.2 million in fiscal 2007 as compared to last year. Also contributing to the increase in cash used for financing activities was a $40.7 million change in other deferred liability accounts (relating primarily to accrued pension liabilities). These uses of cash were off-set in part by a $13.0 million increase in the excess tax benefits relating to stock based compensation, and a $5.3 million increase in cash from issuances of common stock through our stock option and stock-purchase plans. We believe we have adequate liquidity and capital resources to fund our operations and service our debt for the foreseeable future. We had $613.4 million in cash and cash equivalents at September 30, 2007, compared to $434.1 million at September 30, 2006. Our consolidated working capital position at September 30, 2007 was $1.0 billion, compared to $776.8 million at September 30, 2006. We have a long-term, unsecured revolving credit facility providing up to $290.0 million of debt capacity, under which only $40.5 million was utilized at September 30, 2007 in the form of direct borrowings. We believe that the capacity, terms and conditions of our long-term revolving credit facility is adequate for our working capital and general business requirements. New Accounting Pronouncements In addition to SFAS 158 and FIN 48 (discussed above), readers of this MD&A should be aware of the following new accounting pronouncements: In September 2006, the FASB issued Statement of Financial Accounting Standards No. 157 Fair Value Measurements . SFAS 157 provides a common definition of fair value and establishes a framework to make the measurement of fair value in generally accepted accounting principles more consistent and comparable. SFAS 157 also requires expanded disclosures to provide information about the extent to which fair value is used to measure assets and liabilities, the methods and assumptions used to measure fair value, and the effect of fair value measures on earnings. SFAS 157 is effective for the Company 2009 fiscal year, although early adoption is permitted. The Company is currently assessing the potential effect of SFAS 157 on its financial statements.
