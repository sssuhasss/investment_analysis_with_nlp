BUSINESS OVERVIEW Air Products and Chemicals, Inc. is a world-leading Industrial Gases company celebrating 75 years of operation. The Company core Industrial Gases business provides atmospheric and process gases and related equipment to manufacturing markets, including refining and petrochemical, metals, electronics, and food and beverage. Air Products is also the world leading supplier of liquefied natural gas process technology and equipment. The Company Materials Technologies business serves the semiconductor, polyurethanes, cleaning and coatings, and adhesives industries. With operations in over 50 countries, in 2015 we had sales of $9.9 billion, assets of $17.4 billion, and a worldwide workforce of approximately 19,700 employees. Effective 1 October 2014, we began operating under a new organizational structure that is aligned with the regional nature of the industrial gases business. We began reporting our results under the following seven new segments: Industrial Gases Americas, Industrial Gases EMEA (Europe, Middle East, and Africa), Industrial Gases Asia, Industrial Gases Global, Materials Technologies, Energy-from-Waste, and Corporate and other. The financial statements and analysis that follow discuss our results based on these operations. Prior year segment information has been restated to conform with the fiscal year 2015 presentation. Refer to Note 26, Business Segment and Geographic Information, to the consolidated financial statements for additional details on our reportable business segments and segment reorganization beginning in fiscal year 2015. 22 Table of Contents 2015 IN SUMMARY In 2015, we made significant progress in focusing on our core industrial gases business, we reorganized the Company into a more decentralized structure, including realignment of our businesses into new reporting segments, and announced our intention to spin-off the Materials Technologies business by September 2016. We also began changing our culture, improved our focus on safety, implemented a more rigorous capital review process, delivered on our cost reduction targets, and aligned employee rewards to performance at the business unit level. These changes drove increased profitability as we delivered earnings per share growth of 28% and increased operating margin by 450 basis points (bp) to 17.2%, despite significant unfavorable currency impacts. On a non-GAAP basis, earnings per share growth increased 14% and operating margin increased by 310 bp to 19.0%. Highlights for 2015 Sales of $9,894.9 decreased 5%, or $544.1. Underlying sales growth of 3% was more than offset by unfavorable currency and lower energy contractual cost pass-through to customers. Sales increased 2% from higher volumes in Industrial Gases Asia and Materials Technologies and 1% from improved pricing in Industrial Gases Americas and Materials Technologies. Operating income of $1,699.1 increased 28%, or $370.9. On a non-GAAP basis, operating income of $1,884.0 increased 14%, or $227.5, with higher volumes, favorable price, and lower costs driven by restructuring, partially offset by unfavorable currency. Adjusted EBITDA of $2,974.9 increased 8%, or $210.1, primarily due to higher volumes, higher pricing, and favorable cost performance. Income from continuing operations of $1,277.9 increased 29%, or $290.8, and diluted earnings per share from continuing operations of $5.88 increased 28%, or $1.29. On a non-GAAP basis, income from continuing operations of $1,427.0 increased 15%, or $184.0, and diluted earnings per share from continuing operations of $6.57 increased 14%, or $.79. A summary table of changes in diluted earnings per share, including a non-GAAP reconciliation, is presented below. We increased our quarterly dividend by 5% from $.77 to $.81 per share. This represents the 33 rd consecutive year that we have increased our dividend payment. For a discussion of the challenges, risks, and opportunities on which management is focused, refer to our 2016 Outlook below. 23 Table of Contents Changes in Diluted Earnings per Share Attributable to Air Products 2015 2014 Increase (Decrease) Diluted Earnings per Share Net income $5.88 $4.61 $1.27 Income (Loss) from discontinued operations .02 (.02 ) Income from Continuing Operations GAAP Basis $5.88 $4.59 $1.29 Business restructuring and cost reduction actions .71 .04 .67 Pension settlement loss .06 .02 .04 Goodwill and intangible asset impairment charge 1.27 (1.27 ) Business separation costs .03 .03 Gain on previously held equity interest (.05 ) (.05 ) Gain on land sales (.13 ) (.13 ) Loss on early retirement of debt .07 .07 Chilean tax rate change .10 (.10 ) Tax election benefit (.24 ) .24 Income from Continuing Operations Non-GAAP Basis $6.57 $5.78 $.79 Operating income (after-tax) Underlying business Volume .50 Price/raw materials .37 Costs/other .33 Currency (.41 ) Operating Income .79 Other (after-tax) Equity affiliates income .01 Interest expense .08 Income tax rate (.01 ) Noncontrolling interests (.02 ) Average shares outstanding (.06 ) Total Change in Diluted Earnings per Share from Continuing Operations Non-GAAP Basis $.79 2016 OUTLOOK For 2016, we intend to remain focused on key actions we can control to continue to improve cash flow and drive earnings growth. We intend to accomplish this by bringing new projects on-stream, realizing full year benefits of our fiscal year 2015 cost reduction actions, and continued operational improvement actions. We expect overall economic growth to be modest in 2016, which may limit opportunities for underlying growth. Additionally, we expect lower LNG results due to delays in customer investment decisions. We expect to complete the separation of our Materials Technologies segment via a spin-off into a standalone company to be distributed to shareholders by September 2016. The above guidance should be read in conjunction with the section entitled Forward-Looking Statements. 24 Table of Contents RESULTS OF OPERATIONS Discussion of Consolidated Results 2015 2014 2013 Sales $9,894.9 $10,439.0 $10,180.4 Operating income GAAP Basis 1,699.1 1,328.2 1,324.4 Operating margin GAAP Basis 17.2% 12.7% 13.0% Equity affiliates income 154.5 151.4 167.8 Non-GAAP Basis Adjusted EBITDA 2,974.9 2,764.8 2,640.9 Adjusted EBITDA margin 30.1% 26.5% 25.9% Operating income 1,884.0 1,656.5 1,566.1 Operating margin 19.0% 15.9% 15.4% Sales % Change from Prior Year 2015 2014 Underlying business Volume 2% 2% Price 1% % Energy and raw material cost pass-through (3)% 1% Currency (5)% % Total Consolidated Change (5)% 3% 2015 vs. 2014 Sales of $9,894.9 decreased 5%, or $544.1. Underlying sales were up 3% from higher volumes of 2% and higher pricing of 1%. Volumes increased primarily from new plant on-streams in Industrial Gases Asia and growth in Materials Technologies. The favorable pricing was primarily driven by price increases in the Industrial Gases Americas and Materials Technologies segments. Currency unfavorably impacted sales by 5% and lower energy and raw material contractual cost pass-through to customers decreased sales by 3%. 2014 vs. 2013 Sales of $10,439.0 increased 3%, or $258.6. Underlying business increased 2%, primarily due to higher volumes in the Materials Technologies and Industrial Gases Americas segments, partially offset by the exit of our polyurethane intermediates (PUI) business which reduced sales by 1%. Higher energy and raw material contractual cost pass-through to customers increased sales by 1%. Currency was flat as the impacts from a stronger Euro were offset by a weaker Chilean Peso. Operating Income and Margin 2015 vs. 2014 On a GAAP basis, operating income of $1,699.1 increased 28%, or $370.9. Current year operating income included a charge for business reorganization and cost reduction actions of $207.7, a pension settlement loss of $21.2, business separation costs of $7.5, gain on land sales of $33.6, and a gain of $17.9 on revaluing a previously held equity interest upon purchase of our partner shares. Prior year operating income included a goodwill and intangible asset charge of $310.1, a business restructuring and cost reduction charge of $12.7, and a pension settlement loss of $5.5. Operating margin of 17.2% increased 450 bp. On a non-GAAP basis, operating income of $1,884.0 increased 14%, or $227.5. The increase was primarily due to higher volumes of $144, favorable pricing net of energy and fuel costs of $105, and favorable cost performance across most segments of $94, partially offset by unfavorable currency of $115. Costs were lower as benefits from our cost reduction actions of approximately $170 and lower maintenance expense of $33 were offset by higher incentive compensation of approximately $100 due to improved results. Non-GAAP operating margin of 19.0% increased 310 bp due to favorable costs, higher volumes, and higher pricing. 25 Table of Contents 2014 vs. 2013 On a GAAP basis, operating income of $1,328.2 increased $3.8. Operating income in 2014 was reduced by $310.1 for a goodwill and intangible asset impairment charge, $12.7 for a business reorganization and cost reduction charge, and $5.5 for pension settlement losses. Operating income in 2013 was reduced by a charge of $231.6 for a business restructuring and cost reduction charge and $10.1 for advisory costs. On a non-GAAP basis, operating income of $1,656.5 increased 6%, or $90.4. The increase in operating income was primarily due to higher volumes of $140, partially offset by lower recovery of raw material costs in pricing of $29 and higher operating costs of $9. Operating income in 2013 included $10 for gains from the sale of assets and investments. Adjusted EBITDA We define Adjusted EBITDA as income from continuing operations (including noncontrolling interests) excluding certain disclosed items, which the Company does not believe to be indicative of underlying business trends, before interest expense, income tax provision, and depreciation and amortization expense. We believe Adjusted EBITDA provides a useful metric for management to assess operating performance. 2015 vs. 2014 Adjusted EBITDA of $2,974.9 increased $210.1, or 8%, due to higher volumes, higher pricing, and favorable costs. Adjusted EBITDA margin of 30.1% increased 360 bp. 2014 vs. 2013 Adjusted EBITDA of $2,764.8 increased $123.9, or 5%, primarily due to the increase in volumes. Equity Affiliates Income 2015 vs. 2014 Income from equity affiliates of $154.5 increased $3.1, primarily due to higher volumes and favorable cost performance in our Industrial Gases Asia and Industrial Gases Americas affiliates. 2014 vs. 2013 Income from equity affiliates of $151.4 decreased $16.4, due to higher costs from maintenance outages and an unfavorable arbitration award, unfavorable currency impacts, and weaker oil field services volume in Mexico. Cost of Sales and Gross Margin 2015 vs. 2014 Cost of sales of $6,944.1 decreased $690.5, or 9%, primarily due to a favorable currency impact of $368, lower energy costs of $313, and lower operating costs of $102, partially offset by costs attributable to higher sales volumes of $92. Operating costs included favorable impacts from cost reduction actions of $48 and lower other costs, including maintenance, of $115, partially offset by higher incentive compensation of $61. Gross margin of 29.8% increased 290 bp, primarily due to lower costs of 120 bp, higher price, net of raw materials, of 100 bp, and higher volumes of 80 bp. 2014 vs. 2013 Cost of sales of $7,634.6 increased $162.5, primarily due to higher energy costs of $104, higher operating costs, including maintenance, of $72, and an unfavorable currency impact of $24, partially offset by favorable volume mix of $37. Gross margin of 26.9% increased 30 bp, primarily due to favorable volume mix of 100 bp and higher price, net of raw materials, of 20 bp, partially offset by higher operating costs of 90 bp. Selling and Administrative Expense 2015 vs. 2014 Selling and administrative expense of $941.7 decreased $117.6, or 11%, primarily due to the benefits of our cost reduction actions of $122 and favorable currency effects of $62, partially offset by higher costs of $66, driven by higher incentive compensation. Selling and administrative expense as a percent of sales decreased to 9.5% from 10.1%. 2014 vs. 2013 Selling and administrative expense of $1,059.3 decreased $7.0, or 1%, as productivity, including the benefits of recent cost reduction actions, and favorable currency effects more than offset other cost increases. Selling and administrative expense as a percent of sales decreased to 10.1% from 10.5%. 26 Table of Contents Research and Development 2015 vs. 2014 Research and development expense of $138.8 decreased $2.6, or 2%. Fiscal year 2015 and 2014 research and development expense as a percent of sales was 1.4%. 2014 vs. 2013 Research and development expense of $141.4 increased $7.7, or 6%, primarily due to lower government grants and other cost increases. Research and development expense as a percent of sales increased to 1.4% from 1.3%. Business Restructuring and Cost Reduction Actions We recorded charges in 2015, 2014, and 2013 for business restructuring and cost reduction actions. The charges for these actions are excluded from segment operating income. Business Realignment and Reorganization On 18 September 2014, we announced plans to reorganize the Company, including realignment of our businesses in new reporting segments and other organizational changes, effective as of 1 October 2014, which resulted in the largest transformational change in the history of the Company. As a result of this reorganization, we have incurred ongoing severance and other charges. In fiscal year 2015, we recognized an expense of $207.7 ($153.2 after-tax, or $.71 per share). Severance and other benefits totaled $151.9 and related to the elimination of approximately 2,000 positions. Asset and associated contract actions totaled $55.8 and related primarily to a plant shutdown in the Corporate and other segment and the exit of product lines within the Industrial Gases Global and Materials Technologies segments. During the fourth quarter of 2014, an expense of $12.7 ($8.2 after-tax, or $.04 per share) was incurred relating to the elimination of approximately 50 positions. 2013 Plan During the fourth quarter of 2013, we recorded an expense of $231.6 ($157.9 after-tax, or $.74 per share) reflecting actions to better align our cost structure with current market conditions. The charge included asset and contract actions that primarily related to the Electronics Materials business due to continued weakness in the photovoltaic (PV) and light-emitting diode (LED) markets. In addition, the charge included severance, benefits, and other contractual obligations primarily related to our Industrial Gases businesses and corporate functions in response to weaker than expected conditions in Europe and Asia, reorganization of our operations and functional areas, and senior executive changes. Refer to Note 5, Business Restructuring and Cost Reduction Actions, to the consolidated financial statements for additional details on these actions. Pension Settlement Loss Certain of our pension plans provide for a lump sum benefit payment option at the time of retirement, or for corporate officers, six months after the retirement date. Pension settlements are immediately recognized when cash payments exceed the sum of the service and interest cost components of net periodic pension cost of the plan for the fiscal year. The participant vested benefit is considered fully settled upon cash payment of the lump sum. We recognized $21.2 ($13.7 after-tax, or $.06 per share), $5.5 ($3.6 after-tax, or $.02 per share) and $12.4 ($7.8 after-tax, or $.04 per share) of settlement charges in 2015, 2014, and 2013, respectively, to accelerate recognition of a portion of actuarial losses deferred in accumulated other comprehensive loss primarily related to our U.S. Supplementary Pension Plan. Goodwill and Intangible Asset Impairment Charge In July 2012, we acquired a controlling interest in the outstanding shares of Indura S.A., a Latin American industrial gases company. In connection with this acquisition, we recorded $626.2 of goodwill, which is incorporated into the Latin American reporting unit of our Industrial Gases Americas segment. During the fourth quarter of 2014, we concluded that the goodwill and indefinite-lived intangible assets (primarily acquired trade names) associated with this reporting unit were impaired and recorded a noncash impairment charge of $310.1 ($275.1 attributable to Air Products after-tax, or $1.27 per share). Refer to the Critical Accounting Policies and Estimates section below for additional details. 27 Table of Contents Business Separation Costs On 16 September 2015, the Company announced that it intends to separate its Materials Technologies business via a spin-off. During the fourth quarter, we incurred legal and other advisory fees of $7.5 ($.03 per share). Gain on Previously Held Equity Interest On 30 December 2014, we acquired our partner equity ownership interest in a liquefied atmospheric industrial gases production joint venture in North America for $22.6 which increased our ownership from 50% to 100%. The transaction was accounted for as a business combination, and subsequent to the acquisition, the results are consolidated within our Industrial Gases Americas segment. The assets acquired, primarily plant and equipment, were recorded at their fair value as of the acquisition date. The acquisition date fair value of the previously held equity interest was determined using a discounted cash flow analysis under the income approach. During the first quarter of 2015, we recorded a gain of $17.9 ($11.2 after-tax, or $.05 per share) as a result of revaluing our previously held equity interest to fair value as of the acquisition date. Advisory Costs During the fourth quarter of 2013, we incurred legal and other advisory fees of $10.1 ($6.4 after-tax, or $.03 per share) in connection with our response to the rapid acquisition of a large position in shares of our common stock by Pershing Square Capital Management LLC and its affiliates. Other Income (Expense), Net Items recorded to other income (expense), net arise from transactions and events not directly related to our principal income earning activities. The detail of other income (expense), net is presented in Note 24, Supplemental Information, to the consolidated financial statements. 2015 vs. 2014 Other income (expense), net of $47.3 decreased $5.5. The current year includes a gain of $33.6 ($28.3 after-tax, or $.13 per share) resulting from the sale of two parcels of land. The gain was partially offset by unfavorable foreign exchange impacts and lower gains on other sales of assets and emissions credits. No other individual items were significant in comparison to the prior year. 2014 vs. 2013 Other income (expense), net of $52.8 decreased $17.4, primarily due to higher gains from the sale of a number of small assets and investments, higher government grants, and a favorable commercial contract settlement in 2013. Otherwise, no individual items were significant in comparison to 2013. Interest Expense 2015 2014 2013 Interest incurred $152.6 $158.1 $167.6 Less: Capitalized interest 49.1 33.0 25.8 Interest Expense $103.5 $125.1 $141.8 2015 vs. 2014 Interest incurred decreased $5.5. The decrease was driven by the impact of a stronger U.S. dollar on the translation of foreign currency interest of $12, partially offset by a higher average debt balance of $7. The change in capitalized interest was driven by a higher carrying value in construction in progress. 2014 vs. 2013 Interest incurred decreased $9.5. The decrease was primarily due to a lower average interest rate on the debt portfolio which reduced interest by $13, partially offset by a higher average debt balance which increased interest by $6. The change in capitalized interest was driven by a higher carrying value in construction in progress. Loss on early retirement of debt In September 2015, we made a payment of $146.6 to redeem 3,000,000 Unidades de Fomento ( UF ) Series E 6.30% Bonds due 22 January 2030 that had a carrying value of $130.0 and resulted in a net loss of $16.6 ($14.2 after-tax, or $.07 per share). 28 Table of Contents Effective Tax Rate The effective tax rate equals the income tax provision divided by income from continuing operations before taxes. Refer to Note 23, Income Taxes, to the consolidated financial statements for details on factors affecting the effective tax rate. 2015 vs. 2014 On a GAAP basis, the effective tax rate was 24.0% and 27.0% in 2015 and 2014, respectively. The effective tax rate was higher in the prior year primarily due to the goodwill impairment charge of $305.2, which was not deductible for tax purposes, and the Chilean tax reform enacted in September 2014 which increased income tax expense by $20.6. These impacts were partially offset by an income tax benefit of $51.6 associated with losses from transactions and a tax election in a non-U.S. subsidiary. Refer to Note 10, Goodwill, and Note 23, Income Taxes, to the consolidated financial statements for additional information. On a non-GAAP basis, the effective tax rate was 24.2% and 24.0% in 2015 and 2014, respectively. 2014 vs. 2013 On a GAAP basis, the effective tax rate was 27.0% and 22.8% in 2014 and 2013, respectively. As discussed above, the effective tax rate was higher in 2014 primarily due to the goodwill impairment charge and the Chilean tax rate change, which were partially offset by a tax benefit associated with losses from transactions and a tax election in a non-U.S. subsidiary. The 2013 rate included income tax benefits of $73.7 related to the business restructuring and cost reduction plan and $3.7 for the advisory costs. On a non-GAAP basis, the effective tax rate was 24.0% and 24.2% in 2014 and 2013, respectively. Discontinued Operations During the second quarter of 2012, the Board of Directors authorized the sale of our Homecare business, which has been accounted for as a discontinued operation. In 2012, we sold the majority of our Homecare business to The Linde Group and recognized a gain of $207.4. In addition, an impairment charge of $33.5 was recorded to write down the remaining business, which was primarily in the United Kingdom and Ireland, to its estimated net realizable value. In 2013, we recorded an additional charge of $18.7 to update our estimate of the net realizable value. In 2014, a gain of $3.9 was recognized for the sale of the remaining Homecare business and settlement of contingencies on the sale to The Linde Group.

Operating income of $310.4 decreased 6%, or $18.9, primarily due to lower pricing net of energy and fuel costs of $22 and higher operating costs of $21, partially offset by favorable volume mix of $22 and favorable currency impacts of $2. Operating margin decreased 10 bp from the prior year as lower pricing net of energy and fuel costs and higher operating costs, were mostly offset by favorable volume mix and lower energy contractual pass-through to customers. Equity affiliates income of $38.0 decreased $7.0 primarily due to unfavorable currency impacts and an unfavorable arbitration award. 31 Table of Contents Industrial Gases Global 2015 2014 2013 Sales $286.8 $296.0 $309.0 Operating loss (51.6 ) (57.3 ) (56.5 ) Adjusted EBITDA (35.9 ) (44.4 ) (49.6 ) 2015 vs. 2014 Sales of $286.8 decreased $9.2, or 3%, due to unfavorable currency impacts. Operating loss of $51.6 decreased 10%, or $5.7, primarily due to benefits of our recent cost reduction actions and a gain associated with the cancellation of a sale of equipment contract, partly offset by less profitable business mix, unfavorable project costs, and bad debt expense. 2014 vs. 2013 Sales of $296.0 decreased $13.0, or 4%, due to lower air separation unit (ASU) project activity. Operating loss of $57.3 increased $.8 as favorable volume mix was offset by higher operating costs.

Energy-from-Waste 2015 2014 2013 Operating loss $(10.1 ) $(12.4 ) $(9.8 ) Adjusted EBITDA (10.1 ) (12.4 ) (9.8 ) The Energy-from-Waste segment consists of two projects that are under construction in Tees Valley, United Kingdom. These projects are designed to process municipal solid waste to generate renewable power for customers under long-term contracts. Costs being expensed during project construction include land leases and commercial management. Despite technical challenges and on-stream delays, the Company remains focused on efforts to bring the first project on-stream. In November 2015, the Company suspended construction of the second project until certain design issues of the first project are understood, remediated, and can be efficiently integrated into the design of the second project. We are evaluating the incremental costs associated with idling the project, including the impact on capitalized interest. Future actions and assessments could impact the disposition of the investment. Corporate and other 2015 2014 2013 Sales $324.7 $322.2 $418.3 Operating loss (50.6 ) (77.0 ) (84.3 ) Adjusted EBITDA (37.6 ) (66.2 ) (77.8 ) 2015 vs. 2014 Sales of $324.7 increased $2.5, or 1%, primarily due to higher liquefied natural gas (LNG) project activity, mostly offset by lower helium container sales and the impact of exiting our PUI business which was completed as of the end of the first quarter of 2014. Operating loss of $50.6 decreased 34%, or $26.4, primarily due to higher LNG project activity and the benefits of our cost reduction actions. 2014 vs. 2013 Sales of $322.2 decreased $96.1, or 23%, due to the exit of our PUI business, partially offset by higher LNG project activity. Operating loss of $77.0 decreased $7.3, or 9%, from the higher LNG project activity. 33 Table of Contents RECONCILIATION OF NON-GAAP FINANCIAL MEASURES (Millions of dollars unless otherwise indicated, except for share data) The discussion of our annual results includes comparisons to non-GAAP financial measures, including Adjusted EBITDA. The presentation of non-GAAP measures is intended to enhance the usefulness of financial information by providing measures which management uses internally to evaluate our operating performance. We use non-GAAP measures to assess our operating performance by excluding certain disclosed items that we believe are not representative of our underlying business. We believe non-GAAP financial measures provide investors with meaningful information to understand our underlying operating results and to analyze financial and business trends. Non-GAAP financial measures, including Adjusted EBITDA, should not be viewed in isolation, are not a substitute for GAAP measures, and have limitations which include but are not limited to: Our measure excludes certain disclosed items, which we do not consider to be representative of underlying business operations. However, these disclosed items represent costs (benefits) to the Company. Though not business operating costs, interest expense and income tax provision represent ongoing costs of the Company. Depreciation, amortization, and impairment charges represent the wear and tear and/or reduction in value of the plant, equipment, and intangible assets which permit us to manufacture and/or market our products. Other companies may define non-GAAP measures differently than we do, limiting their usefulness as comparative measures. A reader may find any one or all of these items important in evaluating our performance. Management compensates for the limitations of using non-GAAP financial measures by using them only to supplement our GAAP results to provide a more complete understanding of the factors and trends affecting our business. In evaluating these financial measures, the reader should be aware that we may incur expenses similar to those eliminated in this presentation in the future. In 2013, we had pension settlement losses of $12.4 ($7.8 after-tax, or $.04 per share). These impacts were included in the non-GAAP operating performance measures for fiscal year 2013. Presented below are reconciliations of the reported GAAP results to the non-GAAP measures: 34 Table of Contents CONSOLIDATED RESULTS Continuing Operations Operating Operating Net Diluted Income Margin (D) Income EPS 2015 GAAP $1,699.1 17.2 % $1,277.9 $5.88 2014 GAAP 1,328.2 12.7 % 987.1 4.59 Change GAAP $370.9 450bp $290.8 $1.29 % Change GAAP 28 % 29 % 28 % 2015 GAAP $1,699.1 17.2 % $1,277.9 $5.88 Business restructuring and cost reduction actions (tax impact $54.5) 207.7 2.1 % 153.2 .71 Pension settlement loss (tax impact $7.5) 21.2 .2 % 13.7 .06 Business separation costs 7.5 .1 % 7.5 .03 Gain on previously held equity interest (tax impact $6.7) (17.9 ) (.2 )% (11.2 ) (.05 ) Gain on land sales (tax impact $5.3) (A) (33.6 ) (.4 )% (28.3 ) (.13 ) Loss on early retirement of debt (tax impact $2.4) (B) 14.2 .07 2015 Non GAAP Measure $1,884.0 19.0 % $1,427.0 $6.57 2014 GAAP $1,328.2 12.7 % $987.1 $4.59 Business restructuring and cost reduction actions (tax impact $4.5) 12.7 .1 % 8.2 .04 Pension settlement loss (tax impact $1.9) 5.5 .1 % 3.6 .02 Goodwill and intangible asset impairment charge (C) 310.1 3.0 % 275.1 1.27 Chilean tax rate change 20.6 .10 Tax election benefit (51.6 ) (.24 ) 2014 Non-GAAP Measure $1,656.5 15.9 % $1,243.0 $5.78 Change Non-GAAP Measure $227.5 310bp $184.0 $.79 % Change Non-GAAP Measure 14 % 15 % 14 % Continuing Operations Operating Operating Net Diluted Income Margin (D) Income EPS 2014 GAAP $1,328.2 12.7 % $987.1 $4.59 2013 GAAP 1,324.4 13.0 % 1,004.2 4.73 Change GAAP $3.8 (30bp ) $(17.1 ) $(.14 ) % Change GAAP (2 )% (3 )% 2014 GAAP $1,328.2 12.7 % $987.1 $4.59 Business restructuring and cost reduction actions (tax impact $4.5) 12.7 .1 % 8.2 .04 Pension settlement loss (tax impact $1.9) 5.5 .1 % 3.6 .02 Goodwill and intangible asset impairment charge (C) 310.1 3.0 % 275.1 1.27 Chilean tax rate change 20.6 .10 Tax election benefit (51.6 ) (.24 ) 2014 Non-GAAP Measure $1,656.5 15.9 % $1,243.0 $5.78 2013 GAAP $1,324.4 13.0 % $1,004.2 $4.73 Business restructuring and cost reduction actions (tax impact $73.7) 231.6 2.3 % 157.9 .74 Advisory costs (tax impact $3.7) 10.1 .1 % 6.4 .03 2013 Non-GAAP Measure $1,566.1 15.4 % $1,168.5 $5.50 Change Non-GAAP Measure $90.4 50bp $74.5 $.28 % Change Non-GAAP Measure 6 % 6 % 5 % (A) Reflected on the consolidated income statements in Other income (expense), net.

We continue to have consistent access to commercial paper markets, and cash flows from operations and financing activities are expected to meet liquidity needs for the foreseeable future. As of 30 September 2015, we had $195.7 of foreign cash and cash items compared to a total amount of cash and cash items of $206.4. If the foreign cash and cash items are needed for operations in the U.S. or we otherwise elect to repatriate the funds, we may be required to accrue and pay U.S. taxes on a significant portion of these amounts. However, since we have significant current investment plans outside the U.S., it is our intent to permanently reinvest the majority of our foreign cash and cash items outside the U.S. Current financing alternatives do not require the repatriation of foreign funds. Our cash flows from operating, investing, and financing activities from continuing operations, as reflected in the consolidated statements of cash flows, are summarized in the following table: 2015 2014 2013 Cash provided by (used for) Operating activities $2,437.8 $2,186.4 $1,553.1 Investing activities (1,599.7 ) (1,638.0 ) (1,697.0 ) Financing activities (945.4 ) (504.3 ) 115.4 Operating Activities For the year ended 2015, cash provided by operating activities was $2,437.8. Income from continuing operations of $1,277.9 reflected the write-down of long-lived assets associated with business restructuring of $47.4, a non-cash gain on the previously held equity interest of $17.9, and a loss on early retirement of debt of $16.6. Income from continuing operations is adjusted for reconciling items that include depreciation and amortization, deferred income taxes, undistributed earnings of equity affiliates, gains on sale of assets and investments, share-based compensation expense, and noncurrent capital lease receivables. Other adjustments included pension and postretirement expense of $141.4 and contributions to our pension plans of $137.5, primarily for plans in the U.S. and U.K. Management considers various factors when making pension funding decisions, including tax, cash flow, and regulatory implications. The working capital accounts were a source of cash of $218.8. The increase of payables and accrued liabilities of $157.8 includes an increase in accrued incentive compensation of $97.0. For the year ended 2014, cash provided by operating activities was $2,186.4. Income from continuing operations of $987.1 reflected the goodwill and intangible asset impairment charge of $310.1. Other adjustments included $143.2 for pension and other postretirement expense, partially offset by a use of cash of $78.2 for pension contributions. The working capital accounts were a use of cash of $246.5. Inventory was a use of cash of $23.5 primarily due to the timing of helium purchases from the U.S. Bureau of Land Management. The reduction of payables and accrued liabilities of $234.8 includes $148.5 for payments associated with projects accounted for as capital leases and $52.5 of payments related to the 2013 business restructuring and cost reduction plan. For the year ended 2013, cash provided by operating activities was $1,553.1. Income from continuing operations of $1,004.2 reflected the write-down of long-lived assets associated with business restructuring of $100.4. The other adjustments included a use of cash of $300.8 for pension contributions, partially offset by $178.2 of pension and other postretirement expense. The working capital accounts were a use of cash of $207.8. The reduction of accrued liabilities of $130.3 includes $185.8 for payments made in relation to the 2012 business restructuring and cost reduction plans, including the settlement of a long-term take-or-pay silane contract. These payments were partially offset by a $69.7 net increase to accrued liabilities for the 2013 business restructuring and cost reduction plan. Investing Activities For the year ended 30 September 2015, cash used for investing activities was $1,599.7, primarily capital expenditures for plant and equipment. On 30 December 2014, we acquired our partner equity ownership interest in a liquefied industrial gases production joint venture in North America which increased our ownership from 50% to 100%. Refer to Note 6, Business Combinations, to the consolidated financial statements for additional information. For the year ended 30 September 2014, cash used for investing activities was $1,638.0, primarily 39 Table of Contents capital expenditures for plant and equipment. For the year ended 30 September 2013, cash used for investing activities was $1,697.0, primarily capital expenditures for plant and equipment and acquisitions. Refer to the Capital Expenditures section below for additional detail. Capital Expenditures Capital expenditures are detailed in the following table: 2015 2014 2013 Additions to plant and equipment $1,614.8 $1,684.2 $1,524.2 Acquisitions, less cash acquired 34.5 224.9 Investments in and advances to unconsolidated affiliates 4.3 (2.0 ) (1.3 ) Capital Expenditures on a GAAP Basis $1,653.6 $1,682.2 $1,747.8 Capital lease expenditures (A) 95.6 202.4 234.9 Purchase of noncontrolling interests in a subsidiary (A) 278.4 .5 14.0 Capital Expenditures on a Non-GAAP Basis $2,027.6 $1,885.1 $1,996.7 (A) We utilize a non-GAAP measure in the computation of capital expenditures and include spending associated with facilities accounted for as capital leases and purchases of noncontrolling interests. Certain contracts associated with facilities that are built to provide product to a specific customer are required to be accounted for as leases, and such spending is reflected as a use of cash within cash provided by operating activities, if the arrangement qualifies as a capital lease. Additionally, the purchase of subsidiary shares from noncontrolling interests is accounted for as a financing activity in the statement of cash flows. The presentation of this non-GAAP measure is intended to enhance the usefulness of information by providing a measure that our management uses internally to evaluate and manage our expenditures. Capital expenditures on a GAAP basis in 2015 totaled $1,653.6, compared to $1,682.2 in 2014. The decrease of $28.6 was primarily due to a stronger U.S. dollar which reduced the value of foreign currency capital expenditures, partially offset by acquisitions in 2015. Additions to plant and equipment also included support capital of a routine, ongoing nature, including expenditures for distribution equipment and facility improvements. Spending in 2015 and 2014 included plant and equipment constructed to provide oxygen for coal gasification in China, hydrogen to the global market, and renewable energy in the U.K. In 2013, we completed three acquisitions with an aggregate cash use, net of cash acquired, of $224.9. In the fourth quarter, we acquired an air separation unit and integrated gases liquefier in Guiyang, China. During the third quarter, we acquired EPCO Carbondioxide Products, Inc, the largest independent U.S. producer of liquid carbon dioxide, and Wuxi Chem-Gas Company, Ltd. Refer to Note 6, Business Combinations, to the consolidated financial statements for additional details regarding the acquisitions. Capital expenditures on a non-GAAP basis in 2015 totaled $2,027.6 compared to $1,885.1 in 2014. This increase was primarily due to the purchase of the 30.5% equity interest in our Indura S.A. subsidiary from the largest minority shareholder for $277.9. Refer to Note 21, Noncontrolling Interests, to the consolidated financial statements for additional details. Additionally, capital lease expenditures of $95.6 decreased by $106.8, reflecting lower project spending. On 19 April 2015, a joint venture between Air Products and ACWA Holding entered into a 20-year oxygen and nitrogen supply agreement to supply Saudi Aramco oil refinery and power plant being built in Jazan, Saudi Arabia. Air Products owns 25% of the joint venture and expects to invest approximately $100. Air Products has also entered into a sale of equipment contract with the joint venture to engineer, procure, and construct the industrial gas facilities that will supply the gases to Saudi Aramco. Sales backlog represents our estimate of revenue to be recognized in the future on sale of equipment orders and related process technology that are under firm contracts. The sales backlog for the Company at 30 September 2015 was $1,931, compared to $520 at 30 September 2014. The increase in the sales backlog includes a new contract with one of our joint ventures in Saudi Arabia for the construction of an industrial gas facility that will supply gases to Saudi Aramco. 2016 Outlook Excluding acquisitions, capital expenditures for new plant and equipment in 2016 are expected to be between $1,500 and $1,600. A majority of the total capital expenditures is expected to be for new plants. It is anticipated that capital expenditures will be funded principally with cash from continuing operations. In addition, we intend to continue to evaluate acquisition opportunities and investments in equity affiliates. 40 Table of Contents Financing Activities For the year ended 2015, cash used for financing activities was $945.4 primarily attributable to cash used to pay dividends of $677.5 and payments for subsidiary shares from noncontrolling interest of $278.4, which was partially offset by proceeds from stock option exercises of $121.3. Our borrowings (short- and long-term proceeds, net of repayments) were a net use of cash (repayment) of $85.9 and included $284.0 of net commercial paper and other short-term debt issuances, debt proceeds from the issuance of a 1.0% Eurobond of 300 million ($335.3), repayment of a 3.875% Eurobond of 300 million ($335.9), repayment of Industrial Revenue Bonds totaling $147.2, and repayment of 3,000,000 Unidades de Fomento ( UF ) Series E 6.30% Bonds totaling $146.6. Refer to Note 15, Debt, to the consolidated financial statements for additional details. For the year ended 2014, cash used for financing activities was $504.3 primarily attributable to cash used to pay dividends of $627.7, which was partially offset by proceeds from stock option exercises of $141.6. Our borrowings (short- and long-term proceeds, net of repayments) were a net source of cash (issuance) of $1.1 and included $148.7 of net commercial paper and other short-term debt issuances, debt proceeds from the issuance of a $400 senior fixed-rate 3.35% note on 31 July 2014 and $61.0 of other, primarily international, debt issuances and debt repayments of a 3.75% Eurobond of 300 million ($401.0) in November 2013 and $207.6 of other, primarily international, debt. For the year ended 2013, cash provided by financing activities was $115.4. Our borrowings (short- and long-term proceeds, net of repayments) were a net source of cash (issuance) of $927.4 and included $437.7 of net commercial paper and other short-term debt issuances and the issuances of a 300 million ($397) 2.0% Eurobond on 7 August 2013, and a $400.0 senior fixed-rate 2.75% note on 4 February 2013, which were partially offset by the repayment of a $300.0 senior fixed-rate 4.15% note on 1 February 2013. Proceeds from stock option exercises provided cash of $226.4. The primary uses of cash were to purchase 5.7 million shares of treasury stock for $461.6 and to pay dividends of $565.6. Discontinued Operations For the year ended 2015, there were no discontinued operations. For the year ended 2014, cash used for discontinued operations was $146.6 and primarily included a payment made to the Linde Group for contingent proceeds we were obligated to return from the sale of our Homecare business. For the year ended 2013, cash provided by discontinued operations was $13.1. Refer to Note 4, Discontinued Operations, to the consolidated financial statements for additional information. Financing and Capital Structure Capital needs in 2015 were satisfied primarily with cash from operations. At the end of 2015, total debt outstanding was $5,879.0 compared to $6,118.5 at the end of 2014, and cash and cash items were $206.4 compared to $336.6 at the end of 2014. Total debt at 30 September 2015 and 2014, expressed as a percentage of total capitalization (total debt plus total equity plus redeemable noncontrolling interest), was 44.3% and 43.9%, respectively. During fiscal 2013, we entered into a five-year $2,500.0 revolving credit agreement maturing 30 April 2018 with a syndicate of banks (the 2013 Credit Agreement ), under which senior unsecured debt is available to both the Company and certain of its subsidiaries. There have been subsequent amendments to the 2013 Credit Agreement, and as of 30 September 2015, the maximum borrowing capacity was $2,690.0. The 2013 Credit Agreement provides a source of liquidity for the Company and supports its commercial paper program. This credit facility includes a financial covenant for a maximum ratio of total debt to total capitalization (total debt plus total equity plus redeemable noncontrolling interest) no greater than 70%. No borrowings were outstanding under the 2013 Credit Agreement as of 30 September 2015. Commitments totaling $119.4 are maintained by our foreign subsidiaries, of which $110.6 was borrowed and outstanding at 30 September 2015. As of 30 September 2015, we are in compliance with all of the financial and other covenants under our debt agreements. On 15 September 2011, the Board of Directors authorized the repurchase of up to $1,000 of our outstanding common stock. During fiscal year 2013, 5.7 million of our outstanding shares were purchased at a cost of $461.6. We did not purchase any of our outstanding shares during fiscal years 2015 and 2014. At 30 September 2015, $485.3 in share repurchase authorization remains. 41 Table of Contents 2016 Outlook Cash flows from operations and financing activities are expected to meet liquidity needs for the foreseeable future. We project a modest need to access the long-term debt markets in 2016, primarily to refinance maturing long-term debt. We expect that we will continue to be in compliance with all of our financial covenants. Also, we anticipate that we will continue to be able to access the commercial paper and other short-term debt markets. At 30 September, our working capital balance was ($737), primarily due to $1,929.9 of short-term borrowings and long-term debt due within the next 12 months. Maintaining the short-term borrowings balance at its current level provides flexibility in how we manage cash flows associated with the anticipated spin-off of our Materials Technologies business in 2016. Dividends Dividends are declared by the Board of Directors and are usually paid during the sixth week after the close of the fiscal quarter. During 2015, the Board of Directors increased the quarterly dividend from $.77 per share to $.81 per share. CONTRACTUAL OBLIGATIONS We are obligated to make future payments under various contracts, such as debt agreements, lease agreements, unconditional purchase obligations, and other long-term obligations. The following table summarizes our obligations as of 30 September 2015: Payments Due by Period Total 2016 2017 2018 2019 2020 Thereafter Long-term debt obligations Debt maturities $4,385 $436 $373 $428 $415 $361 $2,372 Contractual interest 501 102 84 70 69 50 126 Capital leases 3 1 1 1 Operating leases 367 66 54 46 36 27 138 Pension obligations 871 100 85 85 90 45 466 Unconditional purchase obligations 1,370 917 117 63 55 54 164 Obligation for future contribution to an equity affiliate 100 100 Total Contractual Obligations $7,597 $1,622 $714 $692 $665 $637 $3,267 Long-Term Debt Obligations The long-term debt obligations include the maturity payments of long-term debt, including current portion, and the related contractual interest obligations. Refer to Note 15, Debt, to the consolidated financial statements for additional information on long-term debt. Contractual interest is the interest we are contracted to pay on the long-term debt obligations without taking into account the interest impact of interest rate swaps related to any of this debt, which at current interest rates would slightly decrease contractual interest. We had $929 of long-term debt subject to variable interest rates at 30 September 2015, excluding fixed-rate debt that has been swapped to variable-rate debt. The rate assumed for the variable interest component of the contractual interest obligation was the rate in effect at 30 September 2015. Variable interest rates are primarily determined by interbank offer rates and by U.S. short-term tax-exempt interest rates. Leases Refer to Note 12, Leases, to the consolidated financial statements for additional information on capital and operating leases. Pension Obligations The amounts in the table above represent the current estimated cash payments to be made by us that in total equal the recognized pension liabilities. Refer to Note 16, Retirement Benefits, to the consolidated financial statements. These payments are based upon the current valuation assumptions and regulatory environment. The total accrued liability for pension benefits is impacted by interest rates, plan demographics, actual return on plan assets, continuation or modification of benefits, and other factors. Such factors can significantly impact the amount of the liability and related contributions. 42 Table of Contents Unconditional Purchase Obligations Approximately $390 of our long-term unconditional purchase obligations relate to feedstock supply for numerous HyCO (hydrogen, carbon monoxide, and syngas) facilities. The price of feedstock supply is principally related to the price of natural gas. However, long-term take-or-pay sales contracts to HyCO customers are generally matched to the term of the feedstock supply obligations and provide recovery of price increases in the feedstock supply. Due to the matching of most long-term feedstock supply obligations to customer sales contracts, we do not believe these purchase obligations would have a material effect on our financial condition or results of operations. Refer to Note 17, Commitments and Contingencies, to the consolidated financial statements for additional information on our unconditional purchase obligations. The unconditional purchase obligations also include other product supply and purchase commitments and electric power and natural gas supply purchase obligations, which are primarily pass-through contracts with our customers. In addition, purchase commitments to spend approximately $540 for additional plant and equipment are included in the unconditional purchase obligations in 2016. We also purchase materials, energy, capital equipment, supplies, and services as part of the ordinary course of business under arrangements that are not unconditional purchase obligations. The majority of such purchases are for raw materials and energy, which are obtained under requirements-type contracts at market prices. Obligation for Future Contribution to an Equity Affiliate On 19 April 2015, a joint venture between Air Products and ACWA Holding entered into a 20-year oxygen and nitrogen supply agreement to supply Saudi Aramco oil refinery and power plant being built in Jazan, Saudi Arabia. Air Products owns 25% of the joint venture and guarantees the repayment of its share of an equity bridge loan. In total, we expect to invest approximately $100 in this joint venture. As of 30 September 2015, we recorded a noncurrent liability of $67.5 for our obligation to make future equity contributions based on advances received by the joint venture under the loan. Income Tax Liabilities Noncurrent deferred income tax liabilities as of 30 September 2015 were $903.3. Tax liabilities related to unrecognized tax benefits as of 30 September 2015 were $97.5. These tax liabilities were excluded from the Contractual Obligations table, as it is impractical to determine a cash impact by year given that payments will vary according to changes in tax laws, tax rates, and our operating results. In addition, there are uncertainties in timing of the effective settlement of our uncertain tax positions with respective taxing authorities. Refer to Note 23, Income Taxes, to the consolidated financial statements for additional information. PENSION BENEFITS The Company sponsors defined benefit pension plans and defined contribution plans that cover a substantial portion of its worldwide employees. The principal defined benefit pension plans the U.S. salaried pension plan and the U.K. pension plan were closed to new participants in 2005 and were replaced with defined contribution plans. Over the long run, the shift to defined contribution plans is expected to reduce volatility of both plan expense and contributions. The fair market value of plan assets for our defined benefit pension plans as of the 30 September 2015 measurement date decreased to $3,916.4 from $4,114.6 at the end of fiscal year 2014. The projected benefit obligation for these plans was $4,787.8 and $4,738.6 at the end of the fiscal years 2015 and 2014, respectively. Refer to Note 16, Retirement Benefits, to the consolidated financial statements for comprehensive and detailed disclosures on our postretirement benefits. Pension Expense 2015 2014 2013 Pension expense $135.6 $135.9 $169.7 Special terminations, settlements, and curtailments (included above) 35.2 5.8 19.8 Weighted average discount rate 4.0 % 4.6 % 4.0 % Weighted average expected rate of return on plan assets 7.4 % 7.7 % 7.7 % Weighted average expected rate of compensation increase 3.5 % 3.9 % 3.8 % 43 Table of Contents 2015 vs. 2014 Pension expense, excluding special items, decreased from the prior year due to the impact from expected return on assets, a 40 bp reduction in the weighted average compensation increase assumption, and lower service cost and interest cost. This was partially offset by the impact of higher amortization of actuarial losses, which resulted primarily from a 60 bp decrease in weighted average discount rate. Special items of $35.2 included pension settlement losses of $21.2, special termination benefits of $8.7, and curtailment losses of $5.3. These resulted primarily from our recent business restructuring and cost reduction actions. 2014 vs. 2013 The decrease in pension expense, excluding special items, was primarily attributable to the 60 bp increase in weighted average discount rate, which resulted in lower amortization of actuarial losses. The decrease was partially offset by unfavorable impacts associated with changes in mortality assumptions. Special items of $5.8 included $5.5 for pension settlement losses and $.3 for special termination benefits, a portion of which relates to the 2013 business restructuring and cost reduction plan. 2016 Outlook In 2016, we will change the method utilized to estimate the service cost and interest cost components of net periodic benefit costs for our major defined benefit pension plans. Historically, we estimated the service cost and interest cost components using a single weighted average discount rate derived from the yield curve used to measure the benefit obligation at the beginning of the period. We will elect to use a spot rate approach for our major plans in the estimation of these components of benefit cost by applying the specific spot rates along the yield curve to the relevant projected cash flows, as we believe this provides a better estimate of service and interest costs. We consider this a change in estimate and, accordingly, will account for it prospectively starting in 2016. This change does not affect the measurement of our total benefit obligation. In 2015, we adopted the Society of Actuaries new mortality tables for the U.S. Supplementary Pension Plan when we re-measured the plan due to pension settlements and curtailment. In 2016, we will adopt the new mortality tables for all major plans. In 2016, pension expense is estimated to be approximately $80 to $100, excluding special items, which would be flat to down versus 2015 and results from a reduction of the service cost and interest cost from adoption of the spot rate approach defined above and the impact of the expected return on plan assets, partially offset by adoption of the new mortality tables. Pension settlement losses of $10 to $20 are expected, dependent on the timing of retirements. In 2016, we expect pension expense to include approximately $125 for amortization of actuarial losses compared to $120 in 2015. Net actuarial losses of $431 were recognized in accumulated other comprehensive income in 2015, primarily attributable to lower than expected actual returns on plan assets, improved mortality projections and lower discount rates. Actuarial gains/losses are amortized into pension expense over prospective periods to the extent they are not offset by future gains or losses. Future changes in the discount rate and actual returns on plan assets different from expected returns would impact the actuarial gains/losses and resulting amortization in years beyond 2016. Pension Funding Pension funding includes both contributions to funded plans and benefit payments for unfunded plans, which are primarily non-qualified plans. With respect to funded plans, our funding policy is that contributions, combined with appreciation and earnings, will be sufficient to pay benefits without creating unnecessary surpluses. In addition, we make contributions to satisfy all legal funding requirements while managing our capacity to benefit from tax deductions attributable to plan contributions. With the assistance of third party actuaries, we analyze the liabilities and demographics of each plan, which help guide the level of contributions. During 2015 and 2014, our cash contributions to funded plans and benefit payments for unfunded plans were $137.5 and $78.2, respectively. For 2016, cash contributions to defined benefit plans are estimated to be $100 to $120. The estimate is based on expected contributions to certain international plans and anticipated benefit payments for unfunded plans, which are dependent upon the timing of retirements and future cost reduction actions. Actual future contributions will depend on future funding legislation, discount rates, investment performance, plan design, and various other factors. Refer to the Contractual Obligations discussion on page 42 for a projection of future contributions. 44 Table of Contents ENVIRONMENTAL MATTERS We are subject to various environmental laws and regulations in the countries in which we have operations. Compliance with these laws and regulations results in higher capital expenditures and costs. In the normal course of business, we are involved in legal proceedings under the Comprehensive Environmental Response, Compensation, and Liability Act (CERCLA: the federal Superfund law); Resource Conservation and Recovery Act (RCRA); and similar state and foreign environmental laws relating to the designation of certain sites for investigation or remediation. Our accounting policy for environmental expenditures is discussed in Note 1, Major Accounting Policies, to the consolidated financial statements, and environmental loss contingencies are discussed in Note 17, Commitments and Contingencies, to the consolidated financial statements. The amounts charged to income from continuing operations related to environmental matters totaled $28.3, $35.1, and $37.1 in 2015, 2014, and 2013, respectively. These amounts represent an estimate of expenses for compliance with environmental laws and activities undertaken to meet internal Company standards. Future costs are not expected to be materially different from these amounts. Refer to Note 17, Commitments and Contingencies, to the consolidated financial statements for additional information. Although precise amounts are difficult to determine, we estimate that we spent $4 and $5 in 2015 and 2014, respectively, on capital projects to control pollution. Capital expenditures to control pollution in future years are estimated to be approximately $4 in both 2016 and 2017. We accrue environmental investigatory and remediation costs for identified sites when it is probable that a liability has been incurred and the amount of loss can be reasonably estimated. The potential exposure for such costs is estimated to range from $80 to a reasonably possible upper exposure of $93 as of 30 September 2015. The consolidated balance sheets at 30 September 2015 and 2014 included an accrual of $80.6 and $86.2, respectively. The accrual for the environmental obligations includes amounts for the Pace, Florida; Piedmont, South Carolina; and Pasadena, Texas, locations which were a part of previously divested chemicals businesses. Refer to Note 17, Commitments and Contingencies, to the consolidated financial statements for further details on these facilities. Actual costs to be incurred at identified sites in future periods may vary from the estimates, given inherent uncertainties in evaluating environmental exposures. Subject to the imprecision in estimating future environmental costs, we do not expect that any sum we may have to pay in connection with environmental matters in excess of the amounts recorded or disclosed above would have a material adverse impact on our financial position or results of operations in any one year. Some of our operations are within jurisdictions that have or are developing regulations governing emissions of greenhouse gases (GHG). These include existing and expanding coverage under the European Union Emissions Trading Scheme and California cap and trade scheme; mandatory reporting and reductions at manufacturing facilities in Alberta, Canada; and mandatory reporting and anticipated constraints on GHG emissions in Ontario, Canada, China, and South Korea. In addition, the U.S. Environmental Protection Agency is regulating GHG emissions for new construction and major modifications to existing facilities. At the U.S. state level, California cap and trade program rules have been officially adopted, and our compliance obligation as a hydrogen producer began 1 January 2013. We have been able to mitigate some of the costs through our contractual terms. Increased public awareness and concern may result in more international, U.S. federal, and/or regional requirements to reduce or mitigate the effects of GHG. Although uncertain, these developments could increase our costs related to consumption of electric power, hydrogen production, and fluorinated gases production. We believe we will be able to mitigate some of the potential costs through our contractual terms, but the lack of definitive legislation or regulatory requirements in some of the jurisdictions where we operate prevents accurate prediction of the long-term impact on us. Any legislation that limits or taxes GHG emissions from our facilities could impact our growth by increasing our operating costs or reducing demand for certain of our products. Regulation of GHG may also produce new opportunities for us. We continue to develop technologies to help our facilities and our customers lower energy consumption, improve efficiency, and lower emissions. We are also developing a portfolio of technologies that capture carbon dioxide from power and chemical plants before it reaches the atmosphere, enable cleaner transportation fuels, and facilitate alternate fuel source development. In addition, the potential demand for clean coal and our carbon capture solutions could increase demand for oxygen, one of our main products, and our proprietary technology for delivering low-cost oxygen. 45 Table of Contents OFF-BALANCE SHEET ARRANGEMENTS We have entered into certain guarantee agreements as discussed in Note 17, Commitments and Contingencies, to the consolidated financial statements. We are not a primary beneficiary in any material variable interest entity. Our off-balance sheet arrangements are not reasonably likely to have a material impact on financial condition, changes in financial condition, results of operations, or liquidity. RELATED PARTY TRANSACTIONS Our principal related parties are equity affiliates operating in the industrial gas business. During the third quarter of 2015, we entered into a long-term sale of equipment contract to engineer, procure, and construct industrial gas facilities for our 25% owned joint venture to serve Saudi Aramco Jazan oil refinery and power plant in Saudi Arabia. The principal terms of the agreement are consistent with those that we believe would have been negotiated at an arm length with an independent party. Sales related to this contract are included in the results of our Industrial Gases Global segment and were not material during fiscal year 2015. INFLATION We operate in many countries that experience volatility in inflation and foreign exchange rates. The ability to pass on inflationary cost increases is an uncertainty due to general economic conditions and competitive situations. It is estimated that the cost of replacing our plant and equipment today is greater than its historical cost. Accordingly, depreciation expense would be greater if the expense were stated on a current cost basis. CRITICAL ACCOUNTING POLICIES AND ESTIMATES Note 1, Major Accounting Policies, to the consolidated financial statements describes our major accounting policies. Judgments and estimates of uncertainties are required in applying our accounting policies in many areas. However, application of the critical accounting policies discussed below requires management significant judgments, often as the result of the need to make estimates of matters that are inherently uncertain. If actual results were to differ materially from the estimates made, the reported results could be materially affected. Our management has reviewed these critical accounting policies and estimates and related disclosures with our audit committee. Depreciable Lives of Plant and Equipment Net plant and equipment at 30 September 2015 totaled $9,636.9, and depreciation expense totaled $900.4 during 2015. Plant and equipment is recorded at cost and depreciated using the straight-line method, which deducts equal amounts of the cost of each asset from earnings every year over its estimated economic useful life. Economic useful life is the duration of time an asset is expected to be productively employed by us, which may be less than its physical life. Assumptions on the following factors, among others, affect the determination of estimated economic useful life: wear and tear, obsolescence, technical standards, contract life, market demand, competitive position, raw material availability, and geographic location. The estimated economic useful life of an asset is monitored to determine its appropriateness, especially in light of changed business circumstances. For example, changes in technology, changes in the estimated future demand for products, or excessive wear and tear may result in a shorter estimated useful life than originally anticipated. In these cases, we would depreciate the remaining net book value over the new estimated remaining life, thereby increasing depreciation expense per year on a prospective basis. Likewise, if the estimated useful life is increased, the adjustment to the useful life decreases depreciation expense per year on a prospective basis. The regional Industrial Gases segments have numerous long-term customer supply contracts for which we construct an on-site plant adjacent to or near the customer facility. These contracts typically have initial contract terms of 10 to 20 years. Depreciable lives of the production assets related to long-term contracts are matched to the contract lives. Extensions to the contract term of supply frequently occur prior to the expiration of the initial term. As contract terms are extended, the depreciable life of the remaining net book value of the production assets is adjusted to match the new contract term, as long as it does not exceed the remaining physical life of the asset. Our regional Industrial Gases segments also have contracts for liquid or gaseous bulk supply and, for smaller customers, packaged gases. The depreciable lives of production facilities associated with these contracts are generally 15 years. The depreciable lives of production facilities within the Materials Technologies segment, where there is not an associated long-term supply agreement, range from 10 to 15 years. These depreciable lives 46 Table of Contents have been determined based on historical experience combined with judgment on future assumptions such as technological advances, potential obsolescence, competitors actions, etc. Management monitors its assumptions and may potentially need to adjust depreciable life as circumstances change. A change in the weighted average remaining depreciable life by one year for assets associated with our regional Industrial Gases segments and Materials Technologies segment would impact annual depreciation expense as summarized below: Decrease Life Increase Life By 1 Year By 1 Year Industrial Gases Regional $38 $(33) Materials Technologies $4 $(3) Impairment of Assets Plant and Equipment Plant and equipment held for use is grouped for impairment testing at the lowest level for which there is identifiable cash flows. Impairment testing of the asset group occurs whenever events or changes in circumstances indicate that the carrying amount of the assets may not be recoverable. Such circumstances would include a significant decrease in the market value of a long-lived asset grouping, a significant adverse change in the manner in which the asset grouping is being used or in its physical condition, an accumulation of costs significantly in excess of the amount originally expected for the acquisition or construction of the long-lived asset, a history of operating or cash flow losses associated with the use of the asset grouping, or changes in the expected useful life of the long-lived assets. If such circumstances are determined to exist, an estimate of undiscounted future cash flows produced by that asset group is compared to the carrying value to determine whether impairment exists. If an asset group is determined to be impaired, the loss is measured based on the difference between the asset group fair value and its carrying value. An estimate of the asset group fair value is based on the discounted value of its estimated cash flows. Assets to be disposed of by sale are reported at the lower of carrying amount or fair value less cost to sell. The assumptions underlying the undiscounted future cash flow projections require significant management judgment. Factors that management must estimate include industry and market conditions, sales volume and prices, costs to produce, inflation, etc. The assumptions underlying the cash flow projections represent management best estimates at the time of the impairment review. Changes in key assumptions or actual conditions that differ from estimates could result in an impairment charge. We use reasonable and supportable assumptions when performing impairment reviews and cannot predict the occurrence of future events and circumstances that could result in impairment charges. In 2014, we tested the recoverability of Latin America long-lived assets and concluded they were recoverable from expected future undiscounted cash flows. In 2015, due to continued technical challenges, on-stream delays, and additional capital costs for the two projects associated with our Energy-from-Waste segment that are under construction in Tees Valley, United Kingdom, the Company evaluated different scenarios using undiscounted cash flow analysis to determine whether an indication of impairment exists. Factors specific to this asset grouping include estimating long-term efficiency, output, and on-stream reliability of the projects. The probability weighted undiscounted cash flows of the asset group exceeded the carrying value; therefore, no impairment was indicated. In November 2015, the Company suspended construction of the second project until certain design issues of the first project are understood, remediated, and can be efficiently integrated into the design of the second project. It is reasonably possible that key assumptions or actual conditions may change and result in a future impairment charge. Goodwill The acquisition method of accounting for business combinations requires us to make use of estimates and judgments to allocate the purchase price paid for acquisitions to the fair value of the net tangible and identifiable intangible assets. Goodwill represents the excess of the aggregate purchase price over the fair value of identifiable net assets of an acquired entity. Goodwill was $1,131.3 as of 30 September 2015. Disclosures related to goodwill are included in Note 10, Goodwill, to the consolidated financial statements. 47 Table of Contents We review goodwill for impairment annually in the fourth quarter of the fiscal year and whenever events or changes in circumstances indicate the need for more frequent testing. As a result of our reorganization effective 1 October 2014, we also reviewed goodwill for impairment in the first quarter of 2015 as further discussed below. The tests are done at the reporting unit level, which is defined as being equal to or one level below the operating segment for which discrete financial information is available and whose operating results are reviewed by segment managers regularly. As of 30 September 2015, we had seven business segments and thirteen reporting units. Reporting units are primarily based on products within each business segment. The majority of our goodwill is assigned to reporting units within the three regional Industrial Gases segments and the Materials Technologies segment. As part of the goodwill impairment testing, we have the option to first assess qualitative factors to determine whether it is more likely than not that the fair value of a reporting unit is less than its carrying value. If we choose not to complete a qualitative assessment for a given reporting unit, or if the initial assessment indicates that it is more likely than not that the carrying value of a reporting unit exceeds its estimated fair value, a two-step quantitative test is required. We chose to bypass the qualitative assessment and conduct quantitative testing, as further described below. The first step of the quantitative test requires that we compare the fair value of our reporting units to their carrying value, including assigned goodwill. To determine the fair value of a reporting unit, we initially use an income approach valuation model, representing the present value of estimated future cash flows. Our valuation model uses a discrete growth period and an estimated exit trading multiple. The income approach is an appropriate valuation method due to our capital-intensive nature, the long-term contractual nature of our business, and the relatively consistent cash flows generated by our reporting units. The principal assumptions utilized in our income approach valuation model include revenue growth rates, operating profit margins, discount rate, and exit multiple. Projected revenue growth rates and operating profit assumptions are consistent with those utilized in our operating plan and long-term financial planning process. The discount rate assumption is calculated based on an estimated market-participant risk-adjusted weighted-average cost of capital, which includes factors such as the risk-free rate of return, cost of debt, and expected equity premiums. The exit multiple is determined from comparable industry transactions and where appropriate, reflects expected long-term growth rates. If our initial review under the income approach indicates there may be impairment, we incorporate results under the market approach to further evaluate the existence of impairment. When the market approach is utilized, fair value is estimated based on market multiples of revenue and earnings derived from comparable publicly-traded industrial gases companies engaged in the same or similar lines of business as the reporting unit, adjusted to reflect differences in size and growth prospects. When both the income and market approach are utilized, we review relevant facts and circumstances and make a qualitative assessment to determine the proper weighting. Management judgment is required in the determination of each assumption utilized in the valuation model, and actual results could differ from the estimates. If the estimated fair value of the reporting unit is less than the carrying value, we perform the second step of the impairment test to measure the amount of impairment loss, if any. In the second step, the reporting unit fair value is allocated to all of the assets and liabilities of the reporting unit, including any unrecognized intangible assets, in an analysis that calculates the implied fair value of goodwill in the same manner as if the reporting unit were being acquired in a business combination. If the implied fair value of the reporting unit goodwill is less than the carrying value, the difference is recorded as an impairment loss. In 2014, we conducted our annual goodwill impairment testing as of 1 July 2014 and concluded that the goodwill associated with the Latin America reporting unit, previously within the Merchant Gases segment, was impaired and recorded a non-cash impairment charge of $305.2. The Latin America reporting unit is composed predominately of our Indura business with business units in Chile, Colombia, and other Latin America countries, which the Company acquired in 2012. The acquisition price in 2012 reflected the Company expectations for Indura revenue growth in Chile and across Latin America. At the time of the acquisition, the Indura business had approximately $480 in revenue and 21% EBITDA margin. We anticipated average revenue to grow at a multiple of up to two times long-term manufacturing growth, which was projected at approximately 4%. In addition, we expected additional revenue growth from the Company ability to fund increased on-site plant investment and its application technology capability. We also expected EBITDA margins to expand based on production, distribution, supply chain, and overhead synergies. Revenue growth was also anticipated to drive expanding EBITDA margins and increase future cash flows. 48 Table of Contents In 2014, economic conditions impacting our Latin America reporting unit began to weaken, including a decline in Chilean manufacturing growth, increasing inflation, weaker export demand for many commodities, and the enactment of higher tax rates in Chile. While we achieved expected cost synergies for the Indura business, we did not realize projected revenue growth primarily due to the weakening Chilean economy. Additionally, long-term manufacturing growth forecasts were reduced to 2% to 3% in Chile and other countries in which Indura operates. As a result of these events, we had lowered our growth projections to be in line with lower published growth rates, reduced our expectations for EBITDA margin expansion by approximately 600 basis points, and determined that the associated goodwill was impaired. In 2014, we conducted an additional impairment test on our reporting units that existed as of 30 September 2014 due to the reorganization of our business effective as of 1 October 2014. The fair value of all of the reporting units except Latin America substantially exceeded their carrying value at 30 September 2014. The fair value of our Latin America reporting unit exceeded its carrying value by approximately 10%. The fair value of the Latin America reporting unit was estimated based on a similar outlook and assumptions as those used for the 1 July 2014 testing, and the fair value of the reporting unit exceeded its carrying value primarily due to depreciation and amortization and the $20.6 impact of the Chilean tax rate change. During the first quarter of 2015, we conducted an impairment test based on our new reporting structure. As of 1 October 2014, we determined that the fair value of all of our new reporting units, except Latin America, substantially exceeded their carrying value, and therefore there were no indications of impairment. The Latin America reporting unit, now within the Industrial Gases Americas segment, did not change as a result of the reorganization and its fair value was based on a similar long-term outlook and assumptions as those used in the 2014 impairment testing. During the fourth quarter of 2015, we conducted our annual goodwill impairment testing noting no indications of impairment. The fair value of all of our reporting units, except for our Latin America reporting unit, continued to substantially exceed their carrying value. The fair value of our Latin America reporting unit exceeded its carrying value by approximately 10%. The excess of fair value over carrying value for our other reporting units ranged from approximately 70% to approximately 250%. Management judgement is required in the determination of each assumption utilized in the valuation model, and actual results could differ from the estimates. In order to evaluate the sensitivity of the fair value calculation on the goodwill impairment test, we applied a hypothetical 10% decrease to the fair value of these reporting units. In this scenario, the fair value of our reporting units continued to exceed their carrying value by a range of approximately 50% to 220%. As of 30 September 2015, the carrying value of the Latin America goodwill was $200.9, or approximately 1% of consolidated total assets. The reporting unit represents approximately 5% of the Company total consolidated sales. Revenue growth and EBITDA margin assumptions are two primary drivers of the fair value of our Latin America reporting unit, and these assumptions are underpinned by our expectations for long-term manufacturing growth in the region. In the event of further declines in long-term manufacturing growth projections, we may need to perform additional impairment analysis. We determined that with other assumptions held constant, a decrease in revenue growth rates of approximately 300 basis points or a decrease in EBITDA margins of approximately 200 basis points would result in the fair value of the reporting unit being equal to its carrying value, which would require that we perform step 2 of the impairment analysis to assess the need for additional goodwill impairment. The Latin America reporting unit has other material assets that include: Plant and equipment, net of $363.5, customer relationships of $172.5, and trade names and trademarks of $60.1. The trade names and trademarks are classified as indefinite-lived intangible assets. See impairment considerations for these assets within the Plant and Equipment and Intangible Assets sections of our Critical Accounting Policies and Estimates. Future events that could have a negative impact on the level of excess fair value over carrying value of the reporting units include, but are not limited to: longer-term economic weakness, decline in market share, pricing pressures, inability to successfully implement cost improvement measures, increases to our cost of capital, and changes to the structure of our business as a result of future reorganizations or divestitures of assets or businesses. Negative changes in one or more of these factors, among others, could result in additional impairment charges. We will continue to evaluate goodwill on an annual basis as of the beginning of our fourth fiscal quarter and whenever there are indicators of potential impairment, such as significant adverse changes in business climate or operating results or changes in management business outlook or strategy. 49 Table of Contents Intangible Assets Intangible assets with determinable lives at 30 September 2015 totaled $448.2 and consisted primarily of customer relationships, purchased patents and technology, and land use rights. These intangible assets are tested for impairment as part of the long-lived asset grouping impairment tests. Impairment testing of the asset group occurs whenever events or changes in circumstances indicate that the carrying amount of the assets may not be recoverable. See the impairment discussion above under Plant and Equipment for a description of how impairment losses are determined. Indefinite-lived intangible assets at 30 September 2015 totaled $60.1 and consisted of trade names and trademarks. Indefinite-lived intangibles are subject to impairment testing at least annually or more frequently if events or changes in circumstances indicate that potential impairment exists. The impairment test for indefinite-lived intangible assets encompasses calculating the fair value of the indefinite-lived intangible assets and comparing the fair value to their carrying value. If the fair value is less than the carrying value, the difference is recorded as an impairment loss. To determine fair value, we utilize the royalty savings method, a form of the income approach. This method values an intangible asset by estimating the royalties avoided through ownership of the asset. In the fourth quarter of 2014, we conducted our annual impairment test and determined that our indefinite-lived intangible assets were impaired. Refer to Note 11, Intangible Assets, to the consolidated financial statements for additional information. In the fourth quarter of 2015, we conducted our annual impairment test of indefinite-lived intangibles and found no indications of impairment. Equity Investments Investments in and advances to equity affiliates totaled $1,265.7 at 30 September 2015. The majority of our investments are non-publicly traded ventures with other companies in the industrial gas business. Summarized financial information of equity affiliates is included in Note 8, Summarized Financial Information of Equity Affiliates, to the consolidated financial statements. Equity investments are reviewed for impairment whenever events or changes in circumstances indicate that the carrying amount of the investment may not be recoverable. In the event that a decline in fair value of an investment occurs, and the decline in value is considered to be other than temporary, an impairment loss would be recognized. Management estimate of fair value of an investment is based on estimated discounted future cash flows expected to be generated by the investee. Changes in key assumptions about the financial condition of an investee or actual conditions that differ from estimates could result in an impairment charge. Income Taxes We account for income taxes under the liability method. Under this method, deferred tax assets and liabilities are recognized for the tax effects of temporary differences between the financial reporting and tax bases of assets and liabilities measured using the enacted tax rate. At 30 September 2015, accrued income taxes and net deferred tax liabilities amounted to $55.8 and $720.7, respectively. Tax liabilities related to uncertain tax positions as of 30 September 2015 were $97.5, excluding interest and penalties. Income tax expense for the year ended 30 September 2015 was $415.9. Disclosures related to income taxes are included in Note 23, Income Taxes, to the consolidated financial statements. Management judgment is required concerning the ultimate outcome of tax contingencies and the realization of deferred tax assets. Actual income taxes paid may vary from estimates, depending upon changes in income tax laws, actual results of operations, and the final audit of tax returns by taxing authorities. Tax assessments may arise several years after tax returns have been filed. We believe that our recorded tax liabilities adequately provide for these assessments. Deferred tax assets are recorded for operating losses and tax credit carryforwards. However, when we do not expect sufficient sources of future taxable income to realize the benefit of the operating losses or tax credit carryforwards, these deferred tax assets are reduced by a valuation allowance. A valuation allowance is recognized if, based on the weight of available evidence, it is considered more likely than not that some portion or all of the deferred tax asset will not be realized. The factors used to assess the likelihood of realization include 50 Table of Contents forecasted future taxable income and available tax planning strategies that could be implemented to realize or renew net deferred tax assets in order to avoid the potential loss of future tax benefits. The effect of a change in the valuation allowance is reported in the income tax expense. A 1% point increase/decrease in our effective tax rate would decrease/increase net income by approximately $17. Pension and Other Postretirement Benefits The amounts recognized in the consolidated financial statements for pension and other postretirement benefits are determined on an actuarial basis utilizing numerous assumptions. The discussion that follows provides information on the significant assumptions and expense associated with the defined benefit plans. Actuarial models are used in calculating the expense and liability related to the various defined benefit plans. These models have an underlying assumption that the employees render service over their service lives on a relatively consistent basis; therefore, the expense of benefits earned should follow a similar pattern. Several assumptions and statistical variables are used in the models to calculate the expense and liability related to the plans. We determine assumptions about the discount rate, the expected rate of return on plan assets, and the rate of compensation increase. Note 16, Retirement Benefits, to the consolidated financial statements includes disclosure of these rates on a weighted-average basis for both the domestic and international plans. The actuarial models also use assumptions about demographic factors such as retirement age, mortality, and turnover rates. We believe the actuarial assumptions are reasonable. However, actual results could vary materially from these actuarial assumptions due to economic events and different rates of retirement, mortality, and turnover. In fiscal year 2015, our mortality assumptions were aligned with the IRS mortality assumption used to determine funding valuations, with the exception of the U.S. Supplementary Pension Plan, in which we adopted the Society of Actuaries new mortality tables upon re-measurement of the plan required as a result of pension settlements and curtailments in 2015. As of 30 September 2015, our projected benefit obligation reflects the adoption of the Society of Actuaries new mortality tables for all major plans. Our mortality assumptions will differ from the IRS mortality assumptions used to determine funding valuations, as the IRS is not expected to adopt the new tables until 2017. One of the assumptions used in the actuarial models is the discount rate used to measure benefit obligations. This rate reflects the prevailing market rate for high-quality, fixed-income debt instruments with maturities corresponding to the expected timing of benefit payments as of the annual measurement date for each of the various plans. The timing and amount of the expected benefit payments are matched against the returns of high-quality corporate bonds over the same time period to determine an overall effective discount rate. The rate is used to discount the future cash flows of benefit obligations back to the measurement date. This rate will change from year-to-year based on market conditions that affect corporate bond yields. A higher discount rate decreases the present value of the benefit obligations and results in lower pension expense. A 50 bp increase/decrease in the discount rate decreases/increases pension expense by approximately $31 per year. Effective in fiscal year 2016, we will use a spot rate approach to estimate the service cost and interest cost components of net periodic benefit cost for most of our defined benefit pension plans. The expected rate of return on plan assets represents an estimate of the average rate of return to be earned by plan assets over the period that the benefits included in the benefit obligation are to be paid. The expected return on plan assets assumption is based on a weighted average of estimated long-term returns of major asset classes and the historical performance of plan assets. In determining estimated asset class returns, we take into account historical and future expected long-term returns and the value of active management, as well as the interest rate environment. Asset allocation is determined based on long-term return, volatility and correlation characteristics of the asset classes, the profiles of the plans liabilities, and acceptable levels of risk. Lower returns on the plan assets result in higher pension expense. A 50 bp increase/decrease in the estimated rate of return on plan assets decreases/increases pension expense by approximately $19 per year. We use a market-related valuation method for recognizing certain investment gains or losses for our significant pension plans. Investment gains or losses are the difference between the expected return and actual return on plan assets. The expected return on plan assets is determined based on a market-related value of plan assets. For equities, this is a calculated value that recognizes investment gains and losses in fair value related to equities over a five-year period from the year in which they occur and reduces year-to-year volatility. The market-related value for fixed income investments equals the actual fair value. Expense in future periods will be impacted as gains or losses are recognized in the market-related value of assets. 51 Table of Contents The expected rate of compensation increase is another key assumption. We determine this rate based on review of the underlying long-term salary increase trend characteristic of labor markets and historical experience, as well as comparison to peer companies. A 50 bp increase/decrease in the expected rate of compensation increases/decreases pension expense by approximately $14 per year. Loss Contingencies In the normal course of business we encounter contingencies, i.e., situations involving varying degrees of uncertainty as to the outcome and effect on us. We accrue a liability for loss contingencies when it is considered probable that a liability has been incurred and the amount of loss can be reasonably estimated. When only a range of possible loss can be established, the most probable amount in the range is accrued. If no amount within this range is a better estimate than any other amount within the range, the minimum amount in the range is accrued. Contingencies include those associated with litigation and environmental matters, for which our accounting policy is discussed in Note 1, Major Accounting Policies, to the consolidated financial statements, and particulars are provided in Note 17, Commitments and Contingencies, to the consolidated financial statements. Significant judgment is required in both determining probability and whether the amount of loss associated with a contingency can be reasonably estimated. These determinations are made based on the best available information at the time. As additional information becomes available, we reassess probability and estimates of loss contingencies. Revisions in the estimates associated with loss contingencies could have a significant impact on our results of operations in the period in which an accrual for loss contingencies is recorded or adjusted. For example, due to the inherent uncertainties related to environmental exposures, a significant increase to environmental liabilities could occur if a new site is designated, the scope of remediation is increased, or our proportionate share is increased. Similarly, a future charge for regulatory fines or damage awards associated with litigation could have a significant impact on our net income in the period in which it is recorded.
