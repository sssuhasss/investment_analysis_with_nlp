ITEM 7. MANAGEMENT'S DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS OF FINANCIAL CONDITION AND RESULTS OF OPERATIONS The following Management's Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations (MD&A) is intended to help the reader understand our results of operations and financial condition. MD&A is provided as a supplement to, and should be read in conjunction with, our audited Consolidated Financial Statements and the accompanying Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements and other disclosures included in this Annual Report on Form 10-K (including the disclosures under Item 1A, Risk Factors). Our Consolidated Financial Statements have been prepared in accordance with U.S. generally accepted accounting principles and are presented in U.S. dollars. Management Overview Gilead Sciences, Inc. (Gilead, we or us), incorporated in Delaware on June 22, 1987, is a research-based biopharmaceutical company that discovers, develops and commercializes innovative medicines in areas of unmet medical need. With each new discovery and investigational drug candidate, we strive to transform and simplify care for people with life-threatening illnesses around the world. Gilead's primary areas of focus include human immunodeficiency virus (HIV), liver diseases such as chronic hepatitis C virus (HCV) infection and chronic hepatitis B virus (HBV) infection, oncology and inflammation, and serious cardiovascular and respiratory conditions. We have operations in more than 30 countries worldwide, with headquarters in Foster City, California. We continue to add to our existing portfolio of products through our internal discovery and clinical development programs and through a product acquisition and in-licensing strategy. Our portfolio of marketed products includes Sovaldi , Atripla , Truvada , Harvoni , Complera /Eviplera , Stribild , Viread , Letairis , Ranexa , AmBisome , Zydelig , Cayston , Hepsera , Emtriva , Tybost , Vitekta and Tamiflu . We have U.S. and international commercial sales operations, with marketing subsidiaries in North and South America, Europe and Asia-Pacific. We also sell and distribute certain products through our corporate partners under royalty-paying collaborative agreements. Business Highlights During 2014, we continued to advance our product pipeline across our therapeutic areas with the goal of delivering best-in-class drugs that advance the current standard of care and/or address unmet medical needs. Highlights of our 2014 announcements include: Antiviral Program received approval from the U.S. Food and Drug Administration (FDA) in October 2014 and the European Commission in November 2014 for Harvoni (ledipasvir 90mg/sofosbuvir 400mg), the first once-daily single tablet regimen for the treatment of HCV genotype 1 infection in adults; received approval from the European Commission for Sovaldi in combination with other antiviral agents ribavirin and pegylated interferon alpha in all 28 countries of the European Union (EU) in January 2014; submitted a new drug application (NDA) to Japan Pharmaceutical and Medical Devices Agency for approval of sofosbuvir and our single tablet regimen of ledipasvir/sofosbuvir for the treatment of chronic genotype 1 HCV infection in adults; received approval from the FDA for Tybost, a pharmacokinetic enhancer that boosts blood levels of certain HIV medicines, and Vitekta, an integrase inhibitor for the treatment of HIV infection in adults without known mutations associated with resistance to elvitegravir; submitted a NDA to the FDA for approval of a single tablet regimen containing elvitegravir, cobicistat, emtricitabine and tenofovir alafenamide (E/C/F/TAF) for the treatment of HIV infection in adults; announced an expansion to our agreement with Janssen R&D Ireland Limited (Janssen) for the development and commercialization of a new single tablet regimen containing our TAF and emtricitabine, and Janssen's rilpivirine (RFTAF). We also amended our agreement with Janssen to collaborate on a single tablet regimen for HIV infection containing our TAF, emtricitabine and cobicistat and Janssen's darunavir; 56 entered into an agreement with Phenex Pharmaceuticals AG (Phenex) in December 2014 under which we acquired Phenex Farnesoid X Receptor (FXR) program comprised of small molecule FXR agonists for the treatment of liver diseases, including nonalcoholic steatohepatitis (NASH); announced non-exclusive licensing agreements with India-based generic pharmaceutical manufacturers to expand access to our chronic HCV medicines in developing countries; announced a new agreement with the Medicines Patent Pool to expand access to TAF for HIV and HBV, contingent on FDA approval. Oncology Program received approval from the FDA in July 2014 and the European Commission in September 2014 for Zydelig for the treatment of three B-cell blood cancers. Zydelig is indicated in combination with rituximab for patients with relapsed chronic lymphocytic leukemia and as a monotherapy for patients with relapsed follicular lymphoma and small lymphocytic lymphoma; entered into an exclusive license agreement with ONO Pharmaceutical Co., Ltd. (ONO), for the development and commercialization of ONO's oral Bruton's tyrosine kinase inhibitor for the treatment of B-cell malignancies and other diseases. Cardiovascular Program announced positive results from the AMBITION study (a randomized, double-blind, multicenter study of first-line combination therapy with Letairis (ambrisentan) and tadalafil in patients with pulmonary arterial hypertension), which was conducted in collaboration with GlaxoSmithKline plc. We have filed a supplemental NDA in the United States to cover the use of ambrisentan in combination with tadalafil. Outlook 2015 In 2015 , we will continue to focus on our key operating objectives which include the progression of our product pipeline and continued uptake of our commercial products. From a research and development (R&D) perspective, we will continue to invest in conducting new and ongoing clinical studies, which support both our existing products and our product candidates. We expect to move forward on a number of late-stage clinical studies for new product candidates and plan to file marketing applications for product candidates in various therapeutic areas. From a commercial perspective, we will continue to focus on supporting the uptake of our single tablet regimens for the treatment of HIV, prepare for the launch of our new single tablet regimen containing TAF in the United States and continue to promote the use of Sovaldi, Harvoni and Zydelig in the United States and Europe. We plan to further build-out and expand our international commercial infrastructure in Asia, in particular Japan, and other international markets to support the anticipated launch of Sovaldi and Harvoni in those regions. As a result of the launch of Sovaldi and Harvoni in the United States and Sovaldi in parts of Europe, our business more than doubled in 2014. While we do not expect this level of growth in 2015, we do anticipate overall net product sales growth as we expect expanded access to Sovaldi and Harvoni in the United States and the launch of Harvoni in additional European Union countries and other international markets. However, this growth is subject to a number of uncertainties. These uncertainties include the continuation of a challenging macroeconomic environment in Europe inclusive of the potential adoption of additional pricing measures to reduce healthcare spending, particularly in HCV, the potential for continued volatility in foreign currency exchange rates, the number of HCV patients treated, an increase in discounts, chargebacks and rebates due to ongoing private and public payer negotiations, a larger than anticipated shift in payer mix to more highly discounted payer segments and the regulatory approval and commercial launches of Sovaldi and Harvoni in Japan. We expect that our product pipeline investments and expanding commercial infrastructure will enable us to execute on our 2015 operating objectives. 57 2014 Financial Highlights During 2014, total revenues increased to $24.9 billion and total product sales increased to $24.5 billion , compared to $11.2 billion and $10.8 billion respectively, in 2013 , driven primarily by sales of Sovaldi and Harvoni and increased sales of our HIV single tablet regimen products, Stribild and Complera/Eviplera. Sovaldi was approved in the United States in December 2013 and in the European Union in January 2014. Sovaldi is now available in over 40 countries. Harvoni was approved in the United States in October 2014 and in the European Union in November 2014. R&D expenses increased 35% to $2.9 billion for 2014 compared to 2013 due to continued investment in the progression and expansion in our product pipeline. Selling, general and administrative (SG&A) expenses increased 76% to $3.0 billion for 2014 compared to 2013 due to increased costs to support our business expansion related primarily to liver diseases and oncology and an increase in the Branded Prescription Drug fee (the BPD fee). Net income attributable to Gilead for 2014 was $12.1 billion or $7.35 per diluted share, compared to $3.1 billion or $1.81 per diluted share in 2013 , due primarily to the launch of Sovaldi and Harvoni, partially offset by the increases in operating expenses. As of December 31, 2014, our cash, cash equivalents and marketable securities totaled $11.7 billion . During 2014, we generated $12.8 billion in operating cash flows, issued $8.0 billion in senior unsecured notes and repaid $2.3 billion in debt. Results of Operations Total Revenues Total revenues include product sales and royalty, contract and other revenues. Total revenues were $24.9 billion in 2014 , compared to $11.2 billion in 2013 and $9.7 billion in 2012 . Product sales represented 98% , 96% and 97% of total revenues in 2014 , 2013 and 2012 , respectively. Product Sales Total product sales were $24.5 billion in 2014 , compared to $10.8 billion in 2013 and $9.4 billion in 2012, driven primarily by an increase in antiviral product sales. Antiviral product sales were $22.8 billion in 2014, $9.3 billion in 2013 and $8.1 billion in 2012. The increase in antiviral product sales in 2014 was driven primarily by sales of Sovaldi and Harvoni and in 2013 was driven primarily by the continued uptake of our HIV single tablet regimen products, primarily Stribild and Complera/Eviplera. Other product sales which include Letairis, Ranexa, AmBisome and Zydelig, our first oncology product which launched in 2014, were $1.7 billion in 2014, an increase of 15% compared to $1.5 billion in 2013, an increase of 16% over other product sales of $1.3 billion in 2012. In 2014 approximately 26% of our product sales were generated outside the United States. We face exposure to adverse movements in foreign currency exchange rates, primarily in the Euro. We used foreign currency exchange contracts to hedge a percentage of our foreign currency exposure. Foreign currency exchange, net of hedges, had a favorable impact of $39 million on our 2014 revenues compared to 2013 and an unfavorable impact of $65 million on our 2013 revenues compared to 2012 . We record product sales net of estimated mandatory and supplemental discounts to government payers, in addition to discounts to private payers, and other related costs. These deductions are generally referred to as gross-to-net deductions and totaled $7.3 billion in 2014, $3.9 billion in 2013, and $3.1 billion in 2012. As a percentage of gross product sales, gross-to-net deductions were 23% in 2014, 26% in 2013 and 25% in 2012. The decline in gross-to-net deductions as a percentage of gross product sales in 2014 compared to 2013 was primarily due to change in our payer mix reflecting a higher proportion of private payers compared to the prior year given the launch of Sovaldi in December 2013 and Harvoni in October 2014. The increase in gross-to-net deductions as a percentage of gross product sales in 2013 compared to 2012 resulted primarily from changes in payer mix, while the dollar increase resulted from payer mix and a higher level of gross product sales. Product sales in the United States increased to $18.1 billion for 2014 compared to $6.6 billion in 2013 , due primarily to sales of Sovaldi and Harvoni and increases in sales of Stribild and Complera. Product sales in the United States increased 20% for 2013 compared to $5.5 billion in 2012, driven by sales growth of our single tablet regimen products, specifically Stribild and Complera as well as the launch of Sovaldi. During the fourth quarters of 2014 and 2013, we noted inventory levels at the high end of the inventory management agreement range. As we have seen in years past, we believe that inventory could draw down in the first quarter of 2015 and then track more normally with demand through the rest of 2015. Product sales in Europe increased by 54% in 2014 to $5.1 billion compared to $3.3 billion in 2013 , due primarily to sales of Sovaldi and increases in sales of Stribild and Eviplera. Product sales in Europe increased 6% in 2013 to $3.3 billion compared to $3.1 billion in 2012, driven primarily by higher underlying demand for our antiviral products, specifically Eviplera, partially offset by decreases in the average net selling price of our HIV products. Foreign currency exchange, net of 58 hedges, had a favorable impact of $72 million on our European product sales for 2014 compared to 2013 and an unfavorable impact of $55 million on our European product sales in 2013 compared to 2012. The following table summarizes the period over period changes in our product sales: (In millions, except percentages) 2014 Change 2013 Change 2012 Antiviral products: Sovaldi $ 10,283 * $ 139 * $ Atripla 3,470 (5 )% 3,648 2 % 3,574 Truvada 3,340 7 % 3,136 (1 )% 3,181 Harvoni 2,127 * * Complera/Eviplera 1,228 52 % 810 137 % 342 Stribild 1,197 122 % 539 * 58 Viread 1,058 10 % 959 13 % 849 Other antiviral 88 (21 )% 111 (20 )% 138 Total antiviral products 22,791 144 % 9,342 15 % 8,142 Other products: Letairis 595 14 % 520 27 % 410 Ranexa 510 14 % 449 20 % 373 AmBisome 388 10 % 352 1 % 346 Zydelig 23 * * Other 167 18 % 141 13 % 127 Total product sales $ 24,474 127 % $ 10,804 15 % $ 9,398 * Percentage not meaningful Antiviral Products Antiviral product sales increased by 144% in 2014 compared to 2013 and by 15% in 2013 compared to 2012 . The following is additional discussion of our results by product: HCV Products In 2014, sales of Sovaldi and Harvoni (HCV products) were $12.4 billion. HCV product sales accounted for 54% of our total antiviral product sales for the year. HCV product sales were $10.5 billion in the United States and $1.6 billion in Europe in 2014. Since the launch of Sovaldi in December 2013 and Harvoni in October 2014, more than 170,000 patients around the world have been treated with a sofosbuvir-based regimen. Atripla Atripla sales accounted for 15% , 39% and 44% of our total antiviral product sales for 2014 , 2013 and 2012 , respectively, and decreased by 5% in 2014 compared to 2013, due primarily to declines in volume as doctors prescribed newer treatments such as Complera/Eviplera and Stribild. The efavirenz component of Atripla, which has a gross margin of zero, comprised $1.3 billion , $1.4 billion and $1.3 billion of our Atripla sales in 2014 , 2013 and 2012 , respectively. A generic version of Bristol-Myers Squibb Company's Sustiva (efavirenz), a component of Atripla, was made available in Canada and Europe in 2013 and will be made available in the United States in 2017. While we have observed some pricing pressure related to the efavirenz component of our Atripla sales, we have not yet observed any meaningful splitting of the Atripla single tablet regimen. Truvada In 2014 , Truvada sales increased by 7% compared to 2013 due primarily to an increase in the average net selling price and sales volume growth in the United States. In 2013, decreases in Truvada sales were due to lower sales volume, partially offset by an increase in average net selling price. Truvada sales accounted for 15% , 34% and 39% of our total antiviral product sales for 2014 , 2013 and 2012 , respectively. Complera/Eviplera In 2014 , sales of Complera/Eviplera were $1.2 billion an increase of 52% compared to 2013. Increases in sales of Complera/Eviplera in both 2014 and 2013 were driven primarily by sales volume growth in Europe and the United States. In 2012 , Complera/Eviplera sales increased due primarily to sales volume growth in the United States. 59 Stribild In 2014, sales of Stribild were $1.2 billion , an increase of 122% compared to 2013, due primarily to increased sales volume in the United States and Europe. In 2013 and 2012, increases in sales of Stribild were driven primarily by sales volume growth in the United States. Other Products Other products which include Letairis, Ranexa, AmBisome and Zydelig, our first oncology product which launched in 2014, were $1.7 billion in 2014 compared to $1.5 billion in 2013. The increase in other product sales is due primarily to increased sales volume. Royalty, Contract and Other Revenues The following table summarizes the period over period changes in our royalty, contract and other revenues: (In millions, except percentages) 2014 Change 2013 Change 2012 Royalty, contract and other revenues $ 416 5 % $ 398 31 % $ 304 Royalty, contract and other revenues includes royalty revenues from F. Hoffman-La Roche Ltd (Roche) for sales of Tamiflu. The majority of our royalties are recognized in the quarter following the quarter in which the corresponding product sales occur. Cost of Goods Sold and Product Gross Margin The following table summarizes the period over period changes in our product sales, cost of goods sold and product gross margin: (In millions, except percentages) 2014 Change 2013 Change 2012 Total product sales $ 24,474 127 % $ 10,804 15 % $ 9,398 Cost of goods sold $ 3,788 32 % $ 2,859 16 % $ 2,471 Product gross margin 85 % 74 % 74 % Our product gross margin for 2014 increased compared to 2013 primarily due to changes in product mix, resulting from the launches of Sovaldi and Harvoni. Our product gross margin for 2013 was consistent with our product gross margin for 2012. Research and Development Expenses The following table summarizes the period over period changes in R&D expenses: (In millions, except percentages) 2014 Change 2013 Change 2012 Research and development $ 2,854 35 % $ 2,120 20 % $ 1,760 R&D expenses summarized above consist primarily of clinical studies performed by contract research organizations, materials and supplies, licenses and fees, milestone payments under collaboration arrangements, personnel costs, including salaries, benefits and stock-based compensation and overhead allocations consisting of various support and facilities-related costs. We do not track total R&D expenses by product candidate, therapeutic area or development phase. However, we manage our R&D expenses by identifying the R&D activities we anticipate will be performed during a given period and then prioritizing efforts based on scientific data, probability of successful development, market potential, available human and capital resources and other considerations. We continually review our R&D pipeline and the status of development and, as necessary, reallocate resources among the R&D portfolio that we believe will best support the future growth of our business. The following table provides a breakout of R&D expenses by major cost type: (In millions, except percentages) 2014 2013 2012 Clinical studies and outside services $ 1,688 $ 1,147 $ 828 Personnel and infrastructure expenses 900 714 686 Facilities, IT and other costs 266 259 246 Total $ 2,854 $ 2,120 $ 1,760 60 In 2014 , R&D expenses increased $734 million or 35% compared to 2013 , due primarily to an increase in clinical studies and outside services. The increase in clinical studies and outside services includes one-time items of $350 million for collaboration and acquisition related expenses and the purchase of a FDA priority review voucher and $191 million for expenses related to the progression of clinical study activity, primarily in the oncology and HIV areas. Personnel and infrastructure expenses increased $186 million to support our ongoing clinical study activity, geographic expansion and marketed product support. In 2013, R&D expenses increased $360 million or 20% compared to 2012, due primarily to a $319 million increase in clinical studies and a $28 million increase in personnel and infrastructure expenses to support the continued progression of our clinical studies, particularly Phase 3 studies in oncology, liver diseases and HIV. These increases were partially offset by a $100 million decrease in stock-based compensation expense due to the acceleration of vested stock options related to our acquisition of Pharmasset, Inc. (Pharmasset) in January 2012. In 2012, clinical studies and outside services increased $258 million compared to 2011 due to progression and expansion of our Phase 3 studies, particularly in liver diseases and oncology. Additionally, personnel expenses increased $274 million due to higher headcount to support our product pipeline and study progression. In 2015 , we expect R&D expenses to increase over 2014 to support the expansion of our clinical studies in various therapeutic areas including liver disease, HIV and oncology. Selling, General and Administrative Expenses The following table summarizes the period over period changes in SG&A expenses: (In millions, except percentages) 2014 Change 2013 Change 2012 Selling, general and administrative $ 2,983 76 % $ 1,699 16 % $ 1,461 SG&A expenses relate to sales and marketing, finance, human resources, legal and other administrative activities. Expenses are primarily comprised of facilities and overhead costs, outside marketing, advertising and legal expenses and other general and administrative costs. In 2014 , SG&A expenses increased $1.3 billion or 76% compared to 2013 due primarily to an increase in headcount-related and other expenses of $542 million to support the ongoing growth and expansion of our business, including commercial expansion related to the launches of Sovaldi and Harvoni and an increase in the BPD fee. During the third quarter of 2014, the Internal Revenues Service (IRS) issued final regulations which indicated that a manufacturer obligation to pay its portion of the BPD fee in any given calendar year is triggered by the qualifying sales in the previous year, instead of the first qualifying sale in the current calendar year. As a result of the final IRS regulations, we were required to recognize our 2014 fee of $460 million and 2013 fee of $142 million in our 2014 Consolidated Statement of Income. Our BPD fees were approximately $590 million, $110 million and $85 million in 2014, 2013 and 2012, respectively. The BPD fee is not tax deductible. In 2013 , SG&A expenses increased $238 million or 16% compared to 2012 . The increase was due primarily to a $308 million increase in headcount-related and other expenses to support the ongoing growth of our business, legal expenses and the BPD fee. This increase was partially offset by a $98 million decrease in stock-based compensation due to the acceleration of vested stock options related to our acquisition of Pharmasset in January 2012. In 2015 we expect SG&A expenses to increase compared to 2014 to support our continued build-out and expansion of our commercial infrastructure in Europe and Asia to support our products. Interest Expense In 2014 , interest expense increased to $412 million compared to $307 million in 2013 . The increase was primarily a result of the issuance of our senior unsecured notes in registered offerings in March 2014 and November 2014, offset by repayment of our senior unsecured notes due in December 2014 (the December 2014 Notes), conversion and maturity of our convertible senior notes due in May 2014 (the May 2014 Notes) and partial conversion of our convertible senior notes due in May 2016 (the May 2016 Notes). In 2013 , interest expense decreased to $307 million compared to $361 million in 2012 . The decrease was due primarily to the repayment of our convertible senior notes due in May 2013 (the May 2013 Notes), conversion of the May 2014 Notes, partial conversion of the May 2016 Notes and the repayment of revolving credit facilities. Other Income (Expense), Net Other income (expense), net was not significant for 2014. During 2013 as compared to 2012, the changes in other income (expense), net were due primarily to a $40 million loss on Greek bonds related to Greece's restructuring of its sovereign debt in the first quarter of 2012. 61 Provision for Income Taxes Our provision for income taxes was $2.8 billion , $1.2 billion and $1.0 billion in 2014 , 2013 and 2012 , respectively. The 2014 effective tax rate of 18.8% differed from the U.S. federal statutory rate of 35% due primarily to certain operating earnings from non-U.S. subsidiaries that are considered indefinitely reinvested and tax credits, partially offset by state taxes, our portion of the non-tax deductible BPD fee and amortization expense of the intangible asset related to sofosbuvir for which we receive no tax benefit. We do not provide for U.S. income taxes on undistributed earnings of our foreign operations that are intended to be indefinitely reinvested in our foreign subsidiaries. The 2013 effective tax rate of 27.3% differed from the U.S. federal statutory rate of 35% due primarily to the retroactive extension of the 2012 federal research tax credit in January 2013, the 2013 federal research tax credit and certain operating earnings from non-U.S. subsidiaries that are considered indefinitely reinvested, partially offset by state taxes, our portion of the non-tax deductible BPD fee, amortization expense of the intangible asset related to sofosbuvir and contingent consideration expense related to certain acquisitions for which we receive no tax benefit. The 2012 effective tax rate of 28.7% differed from the U.S. federal statutory rate of 35% due primarily to tax credits and certain operating earnings from non-U.S. subsidiaries that are considered indefinitely reinvested, partially offset by state taxes, the stock-based compensation expense related to the Pharmasset acquisition and contingent consideration expense related to certain acquisitions for which we receive no tax benefit. Acquisitions YM Biosciences Inc. We completed the acquisition of YM BioSciences Inc. (YM), based in Canada, for total consideration transferred of $488 million on February 8, 2013, at which time YM became a wholly-owned subsidiary of Gilead. YM was a drug development company primarily focused on advancing momelotinib, an orally administered, once-daily candidate for hematologic cancers. The fair values of acquired assets and assumed liabilities included primarily in-process research and development (IPR&D) of $363 million , goodwill of $127 million, deferred tax assets of $53 million with a full unrecognized tax benefit, deferred tax liabilities of $109 million and cash acquired of $109 million . Pro forma results of operations for the acquisition of YM have not been presented because this acquisition is not material to our consolidated results of operations. See Item 8, Note 8 Intangible Assets and Goodwill in our Consolidated Financial Statements included in this Annual Report on Form 10-K for a description of the IPR&D acquired. Pharmasset, Inc. In January 2012, we completed the acquisition of Pharmasset, a publicly-held clinical-stage pharmaceutical company committed to discovering, developing and commercializing novel drugs to treat viral infections. Pharmasset's primary focus was the development of oral therapeutics for the treatment of HCV infection. Pharmasset's lead compound, sofosbuvir (formerly referred to as GS-7977), is a nucleotide analog which, in December 2013, was approved by the FDA under the name Sovaldi, as a once-daily oral regimen for the treatment of HCV in patients with genotypes 1, 2, 3 or 4 infection, including those with hepatocellular carcinoma meeting Milan criteria (awaiting liver transplantation) and those with HCV/HIV-1 co-infection. In October 2014, Harvoni, which combines the NS5A inhibitor ledipasvir with sofosbuvir, received approval from the FDA for the treatment of chronic HCV genotype 1 infection in adults. The acquisition of Pharmasset has allowed us to advance our effort to develop all-oral regimens for the treatment of HCV. We acquired all of the outstanding shares of common stock of Pharmasset for $137 per share in cash through a tender offer and subsequent merger under the terms of an agreement and plan of merger entered into in November 2011. The aggregate cash payment to acquire all of the outstanding shares of common stock was $11.1 billion . We financed the transaction with approximately $5.2 billion in cash on hand, $3.7 billion in senior unsecured notes issued in December 2011 and $2.2 billion in bank debt issued in January 2012. The Pharmasset acquisition was accounted for as a business combination. The results of operations of Pharmasset have been included in our Consolidated Statements of Income since January 13, 2012 , the date on which we acquired approximately 88% of the outstanding shares of common stock of Pharmasset and cash consideration was transferred, and as a result, we obtained effective control of Pharmasset. The acquisition was completed on January 17, 2012, at which time Pharmasset became a wholly-owned subsidiary of Gilead and was integrated into our operations. As we do not track earnings results by product candidate or therapeutic area, we do not maintain separate earnings results for the acquired Pharmasset business. 62 The following table summarizes the components of the cash paid to acquire Pharmasset (in millions): Total consideration transferred $ 10,858 Stock-based compensation expense 194 Total cash paid $ 11,052 The $11.1 billion cash payment consisted of a $10.4 billion cash payment to the outstanding common stockholders as well as a $668 million cash payment to option holders under the Pharmasset stock option plans. The $10.4 billion cash payment to the outstanding common stockholders and $474 million of the cash payment to vested option holders under the Pharmasset stock option plans were accounted for as consideration transferred. The remaining $194 million of cash payment was accounted for as stock-based compensation expense resulting from the accelerated vesting of Pharmasset employee options immediately prior to the acquisition. The following table summarizes the acquisition date fair values of assets acquired and liabilities assumed, and the consideration transferred (in millions): Identifiable intangible assets $ 10,738 Cash and cash equivalents 107 Other assets acquired (liabilities assumed), net (43 ) Total identifiable net assets 10,802 Goodwill 56 Total consideration transferred $ 10,858 Refer to Item 8, Note 5 Acquisitions in our Consolidated Financial Statements included in this Annual Report on Form 10-K for more detailed information. Liquidity and Capital Resources We believe that our existing capital resources, supplemented by our cash flows generated from operating activities will be adequate to satisfy our capital needs for the foreseeable future. Our cash, cash equivalents and marketable securities and working capital increased significantly in 2014 compared to 2013 as we issued a total of $8.0 billion in senior unsecured notes in registered offerings in March 2014 and November 2014. The following table summarizes our cash, cash equivalents and marketable securities, our working capital and our cash flow activities as of the end of, and for each of, the periods presented: (in millions) 2014 2013 2012 As of December 31: Cash, cash equivalents and marketable securities $ 11,726 $ 2,571 $ 2,582 Working capital (1) $ 11,953 $ 590 $ 1,918 Year Ended December 31: Cash provided by (used in): Operating activities $ 12,818 $ 3,105 $ 3,195 Investing activities $ (1,823 ) $ (254 ) $ (11,846 ) Financing activities $ (3,025 ) $ (2,544 ) $ 563 (1) Certain prior period amounts have been reclassified to conform to the current presentation. Cash, Cash Equivalents and Marketable Securities Cash, cash equivalents and marketable securities totaled $11.7 billion at December 31, 2014 , an increase of $9.2 billion or 356% when compared to $2.6 billion at December 31, 2013 . During 2014 , we generated $12.8 billion in cash flows from operations; received $7.9 billion from the issuance of senior unsecured notes in registered offerings in March 2014 and November 2014; repaid $2.3 billion in debt, net of convertible note hedges; repurchased $5.3 billion of common stock; and paid approximately $4.1 billion to settle the warrants expiring in 2014 (the 2014 Warrants) related to our May 2014 Notes, which were retired in May 2014. Cash, cash equivalents and marketable securities remained relatively flat at $2.6 billion at December 31, 2013 , when compared to $2.6 billion at December 31, 2012. During 2013, we generated $3.1 billion in operating cash flows, paid $1.0 billion for warrants related to our May 2013 Notes that were settled in August 2013, repaid $1.7 billion in debt net of proceeds from convertible note hedges and utilized $379 million for the acquisition of YM, net of cash acquired. 63 Of the total cash, cash equivalents and marketable securities at December 31, 2014 , approximately $3.2 billion was generated from operations in foreign jurisdictions and is intended for use in our foreign operations. We do not rely on unrepatriated earnings as a source of funds for our domestic business as we expect to have sufficient cash flow and borrowing capacity in the United States to fund our domestic operational and strategic needs. Working Capital Working capital was $12.0 billion at December 31, 2014 . The increase of $11.4 billion from working capital as of December 31, 2013 was driven primarily by positive cash flows from operations and an increase in cash and cash equivalents due to the issuance of senior unsecured notes in March 2014 and November 2014, partially offset by cash paid to settle convertible senior notes and the 2014 Warrants, repayment of our bank debt, and repurchases of common stock. Working capital was $590 million at December 31, 2013 . The decrease of $1.3 billion from working capital as of December 31, 2012 was due to an increase in the current portion of long-term debt and other accrued liabilities, partially offset by increases in accounts receivable, inventories and cash and cash equivalents. Cash Provided by Operating Activities Cash provided by operating activities was $12.8 billion in 2014 , consisting primarily of net income of $12.1 billion , adjusted for non-cash items such as $1.1 billion of depreciation and amortization expenses, $360 million for stock-based compensation expense and $518 million of net cash outflow related to changes in operating assets and liabilities. Cash provided by operating activities was $3.1 billion in 2013 , consisting primarily of net income of $3.1 billion , adjusted for non-cash items such as $345 million of depreciation and amortization expenses and $252 million of stock-based compensation expenses. This was partially offset by $562 million of net cash outflow related to changes in operating assets and liabilities. Cash provided by operating activities was $3.2 billion in 2012 , consisting primarily of net income of $2.6 billion , adjusted for non-cash items such as $278 million of depreciation and amortization expenses, $209 million of stock-based compensation expenses, $108 million of net cash inflow related to changes in operating assets and liabilities. Cash Used in Investing Activities Cash used in investing activities in 2014 was $1.8 billion , consisting primarily of $1.2 billion in net purchases of marketable securities and $557 million in capital expenditures related to the expansion of our business. Cash used in investing activities in 2013 was $254 million , consisting primarily of $379 million used in our acquisition of YM, net of cash acquired and $190 million of capital expenditures primarily related to construction in progress associated with new facilities at our headquarters to support the ongoing growth of our business. This was partially offset by $315 million of net proceeds from sales of marketable securities. Cash used in investing activities in 2012 was $11.8 billion , consisting primarily of $10.8 billion used for our acquisition of Pharmasset, net of the stock-based compensation expense and cash acquired, $672 million of net purchases of marketable securities and $397 million of capital expenditures, related primarily to the purchase of an office building for $180 million and a $156 million increase in construction in progress associated with new facilities at our headquarters to support the ongoing growth of our business. Cash Provided by (Used in) Financing Activities Cash used in financing activities in 2014 was $3.0 billion , consisting primarily of $2.3 billion used to repay debt, net of convertible notes hedges, $5.3 billion used to repurchase common stock under our stock repurchase programs and $4.1 billion to settle the warrants related to our May 2014 Notes. These payments were primarily offset by $7.9 billion in net proceeds from the issuances of our senior unsecured notes due in April 2019 (the April 2019 Notes), senior unsecured notes due in April 2024 (the April 2024 Notes) and senior unsecured notes due in April 2044 (the April 2044 Notes, and together with the April 2019 Notes and the April 2024 Notes, the April Notes) in a registered offering for a total aggregate principal amount of $4.0 billion and from the issuances of our senior unsecured notes due in February 2020 (the February 2020 Notes), senior unsecured notes due in February 2025 (the February 2025 Notes) and senior unsecured notes due in February 2045 (February 2045 Notes, and together with the February 2020 Notes and the February 2025 Notes, the February Notes) in a registered offering for an aggregate principal amount of $4.0 billion . Cash used in financing activities in 2013 was $2.5 billion , consisting primarily of $4.4 billion used to repay debt financing which includes the maturity of our May 2013 Notes and conversions of our May 2014 Notes and May 2016 Notes, 64 $1.0 billion to settle the warrants related to our May 2013 Notes that settled in August 2013 and $582 million used to repurchase common stock under our stock repurchase program. This cash outflow was partially offset by proceeds of $2.8 billion related to our convertible note hedges. Cash provided by financing activities in 2012 was $563 million , driven primarily by net proceeds of $2.1 billion from the issuance of bank debt in conjunction with the Pharmasset acquisition, proceeds of $466 million from issuances of common stock under our employee stock plans and $214 million from proceeds received related to our convertible note hedges. The cash proceeds were partially offset by the $1.8 billion used to repay debt financing during the year and $667 million used to repurchase common stock under our stock repurchase programs. Debt and Credit Facility Debt Financing In March 2014, we issued senior unsecured notes in a registered offering for a total aggregate principal amount of $4.0 billion. We issued the April 2019 Notes for $500 million which pay interest at a fixed annual rate of 2.05% , the April 2024 Notes for $1.8 billion which pay interest at a fixed annual rate of 3.70% and the April 2044 Notes for $1.8 billion which pay interest at a fixed annual rate of 4.80%. In November 2014, we issued senior unsecured notes in a registered offering for a total aggregate principal amount of $4.0 billion . We issued the February 2020 Notes for $500 million which pay interest at a fixed annual rate of 2.35% , the February 2025 Notes for $1.8 billion which pay interest at a fixed annual rate of 3.50% and the February 2045 Notes for $1.8 billion which pay interest at a fixed annual rate of 4.50% . Bank Debt In January 2012, in conjunction with the acquisition of Pharmasset, we entered into a five-year $1.3 billion revolving credit facility credit agreement (the Five-Year Revolving Credit Agreement). In 2012, we borrowed $750 million under the Five-Year Revolving Credit Agreement upon the close of the acquisition. The Five-Year Revolving Credit Agreement contains customary representations, warranties, affirmative, negative and financial maintenance covenants and events of default. The loan bears interest at either (i) the Eurodollar Rate plus the Applicable Margin or (ii) the Base Rate plus the Applicable Margin, each as defined in the credit agreement. We may reduce the commitments and may prepay the loan in whole or in part at any time without premium or penalty. We are required to comply with certain covenants under the credit agreement and note indentures and as of December 31, 2014 , we were not in violation of any covenants. In 2013, we repaid $150 million under the Five-Year Revolving Credit Agreement. During 2014, we repaid the remaining balance of $600 million that was outstanding under the Five-Year Revolving Credit Agreement. The Five-Year Revolving Credit Agreement will terminate and all amounts owed under the agreement shall be due and payable in January 2017. Convertible Senior Notes During 2014, our May 2014 Notes matured and a portion of our May 2016 Notes (together, the May Notes) was converted. During 2014, we repaid $912 million of principal balance relating to the May Notes. We also paid $2.5 billion in cash related to the conversion spread of the May Notes, which represents the conversion value in excess of the principal amount, and received $2.5 billion in cash from the convertible note hedges related to the May Notes. During the year ended December 31, 2014 , we exercised our option to settle in cash the 2014 Warrants. As a result, we paid $4.1 billion to settle the warrants as the market value of our common stock at the time of the exercise of the warrants exceeds their strike price. There were 56 million shares of our common stock underlying the 2014 Warrants, which had a strike price of $28.38 per share and expired during the 40 trading-day period commencing August 1, 2014 and ending on September 26, 2014. Because the warrants could have been settled, at our option, in cash or shares of our common stock, and the related contracts met all of the applicable criteria for equity classification, the settlement was recorded as a reduction of additional paid-in capital in our Consolidated Balance Sheets. As of December 31, 2014, the May 2016 Notes were classified as current given that their conversion criteria had been met. As a result, the related unamortized discount of $15 million was classified as equity component of currently redeemable convertible notes on our Consolidated Balance Sheets. There are 55 million shares of our common stock underlying our warrants expiring in 2016 (the 2016 Warrants). The 2016 Warrants have a strike price of $30.05 per share and are exercisable only on their expiration date. If the market value of our common stock at the time of the exercise of the warrants exceeds their strike price, we will be required to net settle in cash or shares of our common stock, at our option, for the value of the warrants in excess of the warrant strike price. 65 Stock Repurchase Programs Under our stock repurchase program authorized in January 2011 (2011 Program), we repurchased a total of $3.3 billion or 40 million shares of common stock during 2014. In May 2014, our Board of Directors authorized a new $5.0 billion stock repurchase program (2014 Program) through open market and private block transactions pursuant to Rule 10b5-1 plans, privately negotiated transactions or other means. This new program expires three years after the completion of the 2011 Program. We began repurchases under the 2014 Program in October 2014 and repurchased a total of $2.0 billion or 19 million shares. We intend to use the additional authorization to repurchase shares opportunistically and to offset the dilution created by shares issued under employee stock plans. On February 3, 2015, we announced that our Board of Directors authorized a new $15 billion five-year share repurchase program, which we will initiate in 2015 on the completion of our 2014 Program. Long-Term Obligations The summary of our borrowings under various financing arrangements is included in Item 8, Note 10 Debt and Credit Facility in our Consolidated Financial Statements included in this Annual Report on Form 10-K. We believe our existing capital resources, supplemented by cash flows generated from our operations, will be adequate to satisfy our capital needs for the foreseeable future. Our future capital requirements will depend on many factors, including but not limited to the following: the commercial performance of our current and future products; the progress and scope of our R&D efforts, including preclinical studies and clinical trials; the cost, timing and outcome of regulatory reviews; the expansion of our sales and marketing capabilities; administrative expenses; the possibility of acquiring additional manufacturing capabilities or office facilities; the possibility of acquiring other companies or new products; costs associated with the settlement and conversion of our convertible senior notes and related warrants; the establishment of additional collaborative relationships with other companies; and costs associated with the defense, settlement and adverse results of litigation and government investigations. We may in the future require additional funding, which could be in the form of proceeds from equity or debt financings. If such funding is required, we cannot guarantee that it will be available to us on favorable terms, if at all. 66 Critical Accounting Policies, Estimates and Judgments The discussion and analysis of our financial condition and results of operations is based on our Consolidated Financial Statements, which have been prepared in accordance with U.S. generally accepted accounting principles. The preparation of these financial statements requires us to make estimates and judgments that affect the reported amounts of assets, liabilities, revenues and expenses and related disclosures. On an ongoing basis, we evaluate our estimates, including those related to revenue recognition, allowance for doubtful accounts, valuation of intangible assets and contingent consideration liabilities resulting from business combinations and our tax provision. We base our estimates on historical experience and on various other market specific and other relevant assumptions that we believe to be reasonable under the circumstances, the results of which form the basis for making judgments about the carrying values of assets and liabilities that are not readily apparent from other sources. Actual results may differ significantly from these estimates. We believe the following critical accounting policies reflect the more significant judgments and estimates used in the preparation of our Consolidated Financial Statements. Revenue Recognition Product Sales We recognize revenues from product sales when there is persuasive evidence that an arrangement exists, delivery has occurred, the price is fixed or determinable and collectability is reasonably assured. We record product sales net of estimated mandatory and supplemental discounts to government payers, in addition to discounts to private payers, and other related charges. These are generally referred to as gross-to-net deductions and are recorded in the same period the related sales occur. Government and other rebates and chargebacks represent the majority of our gross-to-net deductions and require complex and significant judgment by management. Estimates are assessed each period and updated to reflect current information. Government and Other Rebates and Chargebacks Government and other rebates and chargebacks include amounts paid to payers and healthcare providers in the United States, including Medicaid rebates, ADAPs, Veterans Administration and Public Health Service discounts, and other rebates, as well as foreign government rebates. Rebates and chargebacks are based on contractual arrangements or statutory requirements which may vary by product, by payer and individual payer plans. For qualified programs that can purchase our products through wholesalers or other distributors at a lower contractual price, the wholesalers or distributors charge back to us the difference between their acquisition cost and the lower contractual price. Our consolidated allowances for government and other chargebacks that are payable to our direct customers are classified as reductions of accounts receivable, and totaled $220 million as of December 31, 2014 and $149 million as of December 31, 2013. Our consolidated allowance for government and other rebates that will be paid to parties other than our direct customers are recorded in accrued government and other rebates on our Consolidated Balance Sheets, and totaled $2.3 billion as of December 31, 2014 and $1.0 billion as of December 31, 2013. Our allowances for government and other rebates and chargebacks are estimated based on products sold, historical utilization rates, pertinent third party industry information, estimated patient population, known market events or trends, channel inventory and/or other market data. We also take into consideration new information regarding changes in programs' regulations and guidelines that would impact the amount of the actual rebates and/or our expectations regarding future utilization rates for these programs. We believe that the methodology that we use to estimate our government and other rebates and chargebacks is reasonable and appropriate given the current facts and circumstances. However, actual results may differ significantly from our estimates. During the last three years, our actual government rebates and chargebacks claimed for prior periods have varied by less than 5% from our estimates. 67 The following table summarizes the consolidated activity in our government and other rebates and chargebacks accounts (in millions): Accrued government and other rebates and chargebacks: Balance at Beginning of Year Decrease/(Increase) to Product Sales Payments Balance at End of Year Year ended December 31, 2014: Activity related to 2014 sales $ $ 6,113 $ (3,650 ) $ 2,463 Activity related to sales prior to 2014 1,167 (109 ) (985 ) 73 Total $ 1,167 $ 6,004 $ (4,635 ) $ 2,536 Year ended December 31, 2013: Activity related to 2013 sales $ $ 3,430 $ (2,357 ) $ 1,073 Activity related to sales prior to 2013 886 (121 ) (671 ) 94 Total $ 886 $ 3,309 $ (3,028 ) $ 1,167 Allowance for Doubtful Accounts We maintain an allowance for doubtful accounts for estimated losses resulting from the inability of our customers to make required payments. This allowance is based on our analysis of several factors, including, but not limited to, contractual payment terms, historical payment patterns of our customers and individual customer circumstances, an analysis of days sales outstanding by geographic region and a review of the local economic environment and its potential impact on government funding and reimbursement practices. If the financial condition of our customers or the economic environment in which they operate were to deteriorate, resulting in an inability to make payments, additional allowances may be required. We believe that the allowance for doubtful accounts is adequate; however, significant deterioration in any of the above factors could materially change these expectations and may result in an increase to our allowance for doubtful accounts. As of December 31, 2014 and 2013 , our allowance for doubtful accounts was $31 million and $59 million, respectively. Valuation of Intangible Assets In conjunction with our business combinations, we have recorded intangible assets primarily related to IPR&D projects. We had total intangible assets of $11.1 billion as of December 31, 2014 and $11.9 billion as of December 31, 2013. The identifiable intangible assets are measured at their respective fair values as of the acquisition date. The models used in valuing these intangible assets require the use of significant estimates and assumptions including but not limited to: estimates of revenues and operating profits related to the products or product candidates; the probability of success for unapproved product candidates considering their stages of development; the time and resources needed to complete the development and approval of product candidates; the life of the potential commercialized products and associated risks, including the inherent difficulties and uncertainties in developing a product candidate such as obtaining FDA and other regulatory approvals; and risks related to the viability of and potential alternative treatments in any future target markets. We believe the fair values used to record intangible assets acquired in connection with a business combination are based upon reasonable estimates and assumptions given the facts and circumstances as of the related valuation dates. Intangible assets related to IPR&D projects are considered to be indefinite-lived until the completion or abandonment of the associated R&D efforts. If and when development is complete, which generally occurs if and when regulatory approval to market a product is obtained, the associated assets would be deemed finite-lived and would then be amortized based on their respective estimated useful lives at that point in time. During the period the assets are considered indefinite-lived, they will not be amortized but will be tested for impairment on an annual basis as well as between annual tests if we become aware of any events or changes that would indicate that it is more likely than not that the fair value of the IPR&D projects below their respective carrying amounts. The fair value of our indefinite-lived intangible assets is dependent on assumptions such as the expected timing or probability of achieving the specified milestones, changes in projected revenues or changes in discount rates. Significant judgment is employed in determining these assumptions and changes to our assumptions could have a significant impact on our results of operations in any given period. Intangible assets with finite useful lives are amortized over their estimated useful lives primarily on a straight-line basis. Intangible assets with finite useful lives are reviewed for impairment when facts or circumstances suggest that the carrying value of these assets may not be recoverable. 68 Valuation of Contingent Consideration Liabilities Resulting from Business Combinations In conjunction with our business combinations and consolidation of a variable interest entity for which we are the primary beneficiary, we have recorded contingent consideration liabilities payable upon the achievement of specified development, regulatory approval, sales-based milestone events or financial results. The contingent consideration liabilities are measured at their respective fair values as of the acquisition or initial consolidation date. The models used in valuing these contingent consideration liabilities require the use of significant estimates and assumptions including but not limited to: estimates of revenues and operating profits related to the products or product candidates; the probability of success for unapproved product candidates considering their stages of development; the time and resources needed to complete the development and approval of product candidates; the life of the potential commercialized products and associated risks, including the inherent difficulties and uncertainties in developing a product candidate such as obtaining FDA and other regulatory approvals; and risks related to the viability of and potential alternative treatments in any future target markets. W e revalue contingent consideration obligations each reporting period and record changes in their fair value in R&D expense within our Consolidated Statement of Income. Changes in the fair value of our contingent consideration liabilities can result from updates to one or multiple assumptions such as the expected timing or probability of achieving the specified milestones, changes in projected revenues or changes in discount rates. Significant judgment is employed in determining these assumptions as of the acquisition date and for each subsequent reporting period. Updates to assumptions could have a significant impact on our results of operations in any given period. Actual results may differ from estimates. We had total contingent consideration liabilities of $133 million as of December 31, 2014 and $264 million as of December 31, 2013. Tax Provision We estimate our income tax provision, including deferred tax assets and liabilities, based on significant management judgment. We evaluate the realization of all or a portion of our deferred tax assets on a quarterly basis. We record a valuation allowance to reduce our deferred tax assets to the amounts that are more likely than not to be realized. We consider future taxable income, ongoing tax planning strategies and our historical financial performance in assessing the need for a valuation allowance. If we expect to realize deferred tax assets for which we have previously recorded a valuation allowance, we will reduce the valuation allowance in the period in which such determination is first made. We are subject to income taxes in both the United States and various foreign jurisdictions including Ireland. Due to economic and political conditions, various countries are actively considering changes to existing tax laws. We cannot predict the form or timing of potential legislative changes that could have a material adverse impact on our results of operations. In addition, significant judgment is required in determining our worldwide provision for income taxes. We record liabilities related to uncertain tax positions in accordance with the guidance that clarifies the accounting for uncertainty in income taxes recognized in an enterprise's financial statements by prescribing a minimum recognition threshold and measurement attribute for the financial statement recognition and measurement of a tax position taken or expected to be taken in a tax return. We do not believe any such uncertain tax positions currently pending will have a material adverse effect on our Consolidated Financial Statements, although an adverse resolution of one or more of these uncertain tax positions in any period could have a material impact on the results of operations for that period. At December 31, 2014 and 2013 , we had total federal, state and foreign unrecognized tax benefits of $661 million and $237 million , respectively. Of the total unrecognized tax benefits, $602 million and $195 million at December 31, 2014 and 2013 , respectively, if recognized, would reduce our effective tax rate in the period of recognition. As of December 31, 2014 , we believe that it is reasonably possible that our unrecognized tax benefits will decrease by approximately $12 million in the next 12 months as we expect to have clarification from the IRS and other tax authorities regarding our uncertain tax positions. With respect to the remaining unrecognized tax benefits, we are currently unable to make a reasonable estimate as to the period of cash settlement, if any, with the respective tax authorities. We file federal, state and foreign income tax returns in many jurisdictions in the United States and abroad. For federal income tax purposes, the statute of limitations is open for 2010 and onwards. For certain acquired entities, the statute of 69 limitations is open for all years from inception due to our utilization of their net operating losses and credits carried over from prior years. For California income tax purposes, the statute of limitations is open for 2008 and onwards. Our income tax returns are audited by federal, state and foreign tax authorities. We are currently under examination by the IRS for the 2010, 2011 and 2012 tax years and by various state and foreign jurisdictions. There are differing interpretations of tax laws and regulations, and as a result, significant disputes may arise with these tax authorities involving issues of the timing and amount of deductions and allocations of income among various tax jurisdictions. We periodically evaluate our exposures associated with our tax filing positions. Branded Prescription Drug Fee We, along with other pharmaceutical manufacturers of branded drug products, are required to pay a portion of the BPD fee, which is calculated based on select government sales during each calendar year as a percentage of total industry government sales. The fee is determined by estimating our total sales to government agencies along with an assumption of the total pharmaceutical industry sales to government agencies. Our estimates are based on past history along with expectations of future branded drug sales activity by us along with other pharmaceutical companies. Judgment is employed in determining these assumptions. Updates to assumptions could have an impact on our results of operations. Adjustments to our estimates in the past have not been material. In 2014, the IRS issued final regulations related to the BPD fee which indicate that an entity's obligation to pay its portion of the BPD fee in any given calendar year is triggered by the qualifying sales in the previous year, instead of the first qualifying sale in the current calendar year. As a result of the final IRS regulations, we were required to recognize our 2014 fee of $460 million and 2013 fee of $142 million in our 2014 Consolidated Statement of Income. Our BPD fees were approximately $590 million, $110 million and $85 million in 2014, 2013 and 2012, respectively. The IRS is expected to communicate the final BPD fee amounts due for 2013 sales during the third quarter of 2015 and for 2014 sales during the third quarter of 2016. Our BPD fee accrual totaled $500 million as of December 31, 2014 and $38 million as of December 31, 2013. Off Balance Sheet Arrangements We do not have any off balance sheet arrangements as defined in Item 303(a)(4)(ii) of Regulation S-K. Contractual Obligations Our contractual obligations consist of debt obligations, operating leases, capital commitments, purchase obligations for active pharmaceutical ingredients and inventory-related items and clinical trials contracts. The following table summarizes our significant enforceable and legally binding obligations, future commitments and obligations related to all contracts that we are likely to continue regardless of the fact that certain of these obligations may be cancelable as of December 31, 2014 (in millions): Payments due by Period Contractual Obligations Total Less than one year 1-3 years 3-5 years More than 5 years Debt (1) $ 20,912 $ 453 $ 2,159 $ 1,429 $ 16,871 Operating lease obligations 302 58 102 69 73 Capital commitments (2) 399 323 76 Purchase obligations (3)(4) 2,809 2,252 296 261 Clinical trials (5) 1,207 581 453 118 55 Total $ 25,629 $ 3,667 $ 3,086 $ 1,877 $ 16,999 (1) Our debt obligations include convertible senior notes and senior unsecured notes. Interest payments are incurred and calculated based on terms of the related notes. For further information, see Item 8, Note 10 Debt and Credit Facility in our Consolidated Financial Statements included in this Annual Report on Form 10-K. (2) At December 31, 2014 , we had firm capital project commitments of approximately $399 million primarily relating to construction of new buildings. (3) At December 31, 2014 , we had firm purchase commitments related to active pharmaceutical ingredients and certain inventory-related items. These amounts include minimum purchase requirements. 70 (4) In addition to the above, we have committed to make potential future milestone payments to third parties as part of licensing, collaboration and development arrangements. Payments under these agreements generally become due and payable only upon achievement of certain developmental, regulatory and/or commercial milestones. Because the achievement of these milestones is neither probable nor reasonably estimable, such contingencies have not been recorded on our Consolidated Balance Sheets and have not been included in the table above. (5) At December 31, 2014 , we had several clinical studies in various clinical trial phases. Our most significant clinical trial expenditures are to contract research organizations (CROs). Although all of our material contracts with CROs are cancelable, we historically have not canceled such contracts. These amounts reflect commitments based on existing contracts and do not reflect any future modifications to, or terminations of, existing contracts or anticipated or potential new contracts. We had total gross unrecognized tax benefit liabilities including interest and penalties of $685 million as of December 31, 2014 . We believe that it is reasonably possible that our unrecognized tax benefits will decrease by approximately $12 million in the next 12 months as we expect to have clarification from the IRS and other tax authorities regarding our uncertain tax positions. With respect to the remaining unrecognized tax benefits, we are currently unable to make a reasonable estimate as to the period of cash settlement, if any, with the respective tax authorities. The unrecognized tax benefits were included in current and long-term income taxes payable and long-term deferred tax assets on our Consolidated Balance Sheets and have not been included in the table above. Recent Accounting Pronouncements The information required by this item is included in Item 8, Note 1 Organization and Summary of Significant Accounting Policies in our Consolidated Financial Statements included in this Annual Report on Form 10-K.
