ITEM 7 Management Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations EXECUTIVE OVERVIEW We are a global consumer foods company. We develop distinctive value-added food products and market them under unique brand names. We work continuously to improve our core products and to create new products that meet consumers evolving needs and preferences. In addition, we build the equity of our brands over time with strong consumer-directed marketing, innovative new products, and effective merchandising. We believe our brand-building strategy is the key to winning and sustaining leading share positions in markets around the globe. Our fundamental financial goal is to generate superior returns for our shareholders over the long term. We believe that increases in net sales, segment operating profit, earnings per share (EPS), free cash flow conversion, cash return to shareholders, and return on average total capital are key drivers of financial performance for our business. Our long-term growth objectives are to consistently deliver: low single-digit annual growth in net sales; mid single-digit annual growth in total segment operating profit; high single-digit annual growth in diluted EPS excluding certain items affecting comparability; improvement in adjusted return on average total capital; free cash flow conversion averaging above 95 percent of adjusted net earnings after tax; and cash return to shareholders averaging above 90 percent of free cash flow, including an attractive dividend yield. We believe that this financial performance should result in long-term value creation for shareholders. Fiscal 2016 was an important step toward returning to our long-term growth objectives. Our U.S. Retail segment improved its operating profit performance in fiscal 2016, excluding the impact of acquisitions and divestitures, primarily the North American Green Giant business (Green Giant) divestiture and 6 incremental months of results from the acquisition of Annie s, Inc. (Annie s). Net sales as reported declined 5 percentage points in fiscal 2016, which included 2 percentage points of decline from the net impact of Green Giant and Annie and 1 percentage point of decline from a 53 rd week in fiscal 2015. While net sales growth did not meet our expectations, operating profit increased 1 percent, despite the 53 rd week in fiscal 2015 and the net unfavorable impact of the Green Giant divestiture and Annie acquisition. Operating profit for the Convenience Stores and Foodservice segment increased 7 percent, driven primarily by our 6 priority product platforms. Operating results for the International segment had good growth in developed markets that was tempered by slowdowns in developing markets. International net sales as reported declined 10 percent, including 1 percentage point of decline from the divestiture of Green Giant, our Venezuela business, and our foodservice business in Argentina, but grew 3 percent on a constant-currency basis. International segment operating profit declined 15 percent and was impacted by 12 percentage points of unfavorable foreign currency exchange and slowing economic growth in China and Brazil, as well as the effect of divestitures. Our consolidated net sales for fiscal 2016 declined 6 percent to $16.6 billion, primarily driven by unfavorable foreign exchange, a 53 rd week in fiscal 2015, and the net impact of acquisitions and divestitures. On a constant-currency basis, net sales decreased 2 percent. Operating profit of $2.7 billion increased 30 percent. Total segment operating profit of $3.0 billion declined 1 percent and grew 1 percent on a constant-currency basis. Diluted EPS increased 41 percent to $2.77 per share. Adjusted diluted EPS, which excludes certain items affecting comparability of results, rose 2 percent to $2.92 per share and increased 5 percent on a constant-currency basis. Our return on average total capital was 12.9 percent, and return on adjusted average total capital increased 10 basis points to 11.3 percent. (See the Non-GAAP Measures section below for discussion of total segment operating profit, adjusted diluted EPS, constant-currency net sales growth rates, constant-currency International segment net sales growth rate, constant-currency total segment operating profit growth rate, constant-currency adjusted diluted EPS growth rate, and adjusted return on average total capital, which are not defined by generally accepted accounting principles (GAAP)). Net cash provided by operations totaled $2.6 billion in fiscal 2016 at a conversion rate of 151 percent of net earnings, including earnings attributable to redeemable and noncontrolling interests. This cash generation supported capital investments totaling $729 million, and our resulting free cash flow was $1.9 billion at a conversion rate of 17 Table of Contents 104 percent of adjusted net earnings, including earnings attributable to redeemable and noncontrolling interests. We also returned significant cash to shareholders through a 7 percent dividend increase and share repurchases totaling $607 million. Total cash returned to shareholders represented 79 percent of our free cash flow (see the Non-GAAP Measures section below for a description of our use of measures not defined by GAAP). We recorded the following achievements related to our other key operating objectives for fiscal 2016: We took steps to reshape our business portfolio to drive future growth with the divestiture of our North American Green Giant vegetable business and two smaller divestures, the Venezuela canned meat business and the foodservice dough business in Argentina. We also acquired EPIC Provisions LLC (Epic), broadening our product offerings in our U.S. natural and organic portfolio to include meat snacks, and we entered the growing Brazilian yogurt market through the acquisition of Laticinios Carolina Ltda. (Carolina). We generated strong levels of supply chain productivity savings in fiscal 2016 through our ongoing Holistic Margin Management (HMM) efforts. We also continued to execute our cost savings and organizational initiatives during the fiscal year. We expanded Project Century, an initiative to streamline our North American distribution and manufacturing network, to our International segment supply chain. We also initiated Project Compass, with a focus on increasing the agility and effectiveness of our International segment. Finally, we continued to realize benefits from Project Catalyst, a fiscal 2015 restructuring plan to increase organizational effectiveness and reduce overhead expense. In aggregate, the initiatives taken in fiscal 2015 and 2016 generated almost $350 million in cost savings during fiscal 2016. A detailed review of our fiscal 2016 performance appears below in the section titled Fiscal 2016 Consolidated Results of Operations. With strong savings in Fiscal 2016 and visibility to further savings over the next two years, we now expect our previously announced organizational restructuring and cost-reduction initiatives, including Projects Century, Catalyst, and Compass, as well as administrative cost reductions, to generate total annual savings of $600 million by fiscal 2018. We are also undertaking further efforts to prioritize investments, reduce complexity, and streamline our operations to drive profitable sales growth. As a result, we are increasing and accelerating our adjusted operating profit margin expansion target. We expect to achieve an adjusted operating profit margin of 20 percent by fiscal 2018, an increase of 400 basis points over fiscal 2015 levels. Key drivers of margin expansion over the next two years will include: Strong levels of HMM productivity gains; Continuing savings from previously announced cost-reduction initiatives; Increased efficiency and prioritization of commercial investments, including trade and consumer spending; Continuing focus on complexity reduction through SKU optimization; Further supply chain optimization; and Continued expansion of zero-based budgeting across the business. We will focus our fiscal 2017 and fiscal 2018 growth investments on our brands and platforms with the strongest profitable growth potential, including: In the U.S. Retail segment Cereal, snack bars, the natural and organic portfolio, hot snacks, Mexican products, and yogurt; Our International segment; 18 Table of Contents In the Convenience Stores and Foodservice segment Cereal, yogurt, snacks, frozen meals, biscuits, and baking mixes the segment current Focus 6 platforms. Net sales for these growth businesses, which comprise 75 percent of total company net sales and a similar proportion of operating profit, are expected to grow at a low single-digit organic rate in fiscal 2017. In our foundation businesses, which comprise the remainder of the portfolio, we will only pursue selective growth investments and will focus on reducing SKU complexity, optimizing commercial investments, and prioritizing profitable volume while making selective Consumer First investments. We expect organic net sales to decline mid single-digits for these businesses in fiscal 2017. With this focused approach, we expect: Fiscal 2017 organic net sales growth ranging from flat to down 2 percent compared to fiscal 2016, but deliver a 6 to 8 percent increase in constant-currency total segment operating profit. Fiscal 2017 adjusted operating profit margin to increase by approximately 150 basis points; and Constant-currency adjusted diluted EPS to grow 6 to 8 percent from the base of $2.92 earned in fiscal 2016. Our fiscal 2017 plans call for continued strong cash returns to shareholders. The current annualized dividend rate of $1.92 per share is up 8 percent from the annual dividend paid in fiscal 2016. Share repurchases in fiscal 2017 are expected to result in a net reduction in average diluted shares outstanding of approximately 1 to 2 percent. The foregoing non-GAAP forward-looking financial measures are not reconcilable to the equivalent GAAP measure because we cannot accurately predict the excluded variables that may impact these measures. Certain terms used throughout this report are defined in a glossary in Item 8 of this report. FISCAL 2016 CONSOLIDATED RESULTS OF OPERATIONS Fiscal 2016 had 52 weeks compared to 53 weeks in fiscal 2015. Included in fiscal 2016 is an additional month of results from Annie and Yoplait SAS (please refer to Note 1 to the Consolidated Financial Statements in Item 8 of this report). Fiscal 2016 net sales declined 6 percent to $16,563 million and decreased 2 percent on a constant-currency basis. Operating profit of $2,707 million was 30 percent higher than fiscal 2015. Total segment operating profit was $3,000 million, 1 percent lower than fiscal 2015 and 1 percent higher on a constant-currency basis. In fiscal 2016, net earnings attributable to General Mills were $1,697 million, up 39 percent from $1,221 million in fiscal 2015, and we reported diluted EPS of $2.77 in fiscal 2016, up 41 percent from $1.97 in fiscal 2015. Fiscal 2016 results include restructuring-related charges, a net gain from divestitures, and gains from the mark-to-market valuation of certain commodity positions and grain inventories. Fiscal 2015 results include restructuring-related charges, an indefinite-lived intangible asset impairment charge, tax impacts from the repatriation of historical foreign earnings, losses from the mark-to-market valuation of certain commodity positions and grain inventories, integration costs resulting from the acquisition of Annie s, and the impact of Venezuela currency devaluation. Diluted EPS excluding these items affecting comparability totaled $2.92 in fiscal 2016, up 2 percent from $2.86 in fiscal 2015. Diluted EPS excluding certain items affecting comparability on a constant-currency basis increased 5 percent compared to fiscal 2015 (see the Non-GAAP Measures section below for a description of our use of measures not defined by GAAP). 19 Table of Contents Net sales declined 6 percent to $16,563 million in fiscal 2016 from $17,630 in fiscal 2015. The components of net sales growth are shown in the following table: Fiscal 2016 vs. 2015 Contributions from volume growth (a) (3) pts Net price realization and mix 1 pt Foreign currency exchange (4) pts Net sales growth (6) pts (a) Measured in tons based on the stated weight of our product shipments. Net sales growth for fiscal 2016 included a 1 percent decrease from acquisitions and divestitures, primarily Green Giant and Annie s, reflecting 2 percentage points of decline from volume (please refer to Note 3 to the Consolidated Financial Statements in Item 8 of this report). The 53 rd week in fiscal 2015 contributed approximately 1 percentage point of net sales decline in fiscal 2016, reflecting 1 percentage point of decline from volume. Cost of sales decreased $948 million in fiscal 2016 to $10,734 million. In fiscal 2016, product mix drove a $486 million decrease in cost of sales and lower volume drove a $369 million decrease. We recorded a $63 million net decrease in cost of sales related to mark-to-market valuation of certain commodity positions and grain inventories as described in Note 7 to the Consolidated Financial Statements in Item 8 of this report, compared to a net increase of $90 million in fiscal 2015. In fiscal 2016, we recorded $78 million of restructuring charges in cost of sales compared to $60 million in fiscal 2015. We also recorded a $3 million foreign exchange loss in cost of sales in fiscal 2015 related to Venezuela currency devaluation. We also expect to incur approximately $109 million of restructuring initiative project-related cash costs and recorded $58 million of these costs in cost of sales in fiscal 2016 compared to $13 million in fiscal 2015 (please refer to Note 4 to the Consolidated Financial Statements in Item 8 of this report). Gross margin declined 2 percent in fiscal 2016 versus fiscal 2015. Gross margin as a percent of net sales of 35 percent increased 150 basis points compared to fiscal 2015. Selling, general and administrative (SG&A) expenses decreased $209 million in fiscal 2016 versus fiscal 2015 primarily due to an 8 percent decrease in advertising and media expense, and savings from Project Catalyst, Project Compass, and our other cost-management initiatives (please refer to Note 4 to the Consolidated Financial Statements in Item 8 of this report). In fiscal 2015, we recorded a $5 million charge in SG&A expenses related to Venezuela currency devaluation and $16 million of integration costs related to our acquisition of Annie s. SG&A expenses as a percent of net sales decreased 10 basis points compared to fiscal 2015. During fiscal 2016, we recorded an $148 million divestitures gain (net) from the sale of Green Giant, our subsidiary in Venezuela, and our foodservice business in Argentina (please refer to Note 3 of the Consolidated Financial Statements in Item 8 of this report). Restructuring, impairment, and other exit costs totaled $151 million in fiscal 2016 compared to $544 million in fiscal 2015. In fiscal 2015, we made a strategic decision to redirect certain resources supporting our Green Giant business in our U.S. Retail segment to other businesses within the segment. As a result, we recorded a $260 million impairment charge in fiscal 2015 related to the Green Giant brand intangible asset. 20 Table of Contents Restructuring charges recorded in restructuring, impairment, and other exit costs were $151 million in fiscal 2016 compared to $284 million in fiscal 2015. Total charges associated with our restructuring initiatives recognized in fiscal 2016 and 2015 consisted of the following: As Reported Estimated In Millions Fiscal 2016 Fiscal 2015 Future Total Savings (b) Charge Cash Charge Cash Charge Cash Charge Cash Compass $ 54.7 $ 36.1 $ $ $ 5 $ 24 $ 60 $ 60 Total Century (a) 182.6 34.1 181.8 12.0 75 120 439 166 Catalyst (7.5 ) 47.8 148.4 45.0 25 141 118 Combination of certain operational facilities 4.5 13.9 6.5 1 2 15 12 Other 0.1 (0.6 ) 0.1 Total restructuring charges (a) 229.8 122.6 343.5 63.6 81 171 655 356 Project-related costs 57.5 54.5 13.2 9.7 38 45 109 109 Restructuring charges and project-related costs $ 287.3 $ 177.1 $ 356.7 $ 73.3 $ 119 $ 216 $ 764 $ 465 Future cumulative annual savings $ 600 (a) Includes restructuring charges recorded in cost of sales of $78.4 million in fiscal 2016 and $59.6 million in fiscal 2015. (b) Cumulative annual savings estimated by fiscal 2018. Includes savings from SG&A cost reduction projects. Please refer to Note 4 to the Consolidated Financial Statements in Item 8 of this report for more information regarding our restructuring activities. Interest, net for fiscal 2016 totaled $304 million, $12 million lower than fiscal 2015, primarily driven by lower average debt balances, partially offset by changes in the mix of debt. Our consolidated effective tax rate for fiscal 2016 was 31.4 percent compared to 33.3 percent in fiscal 2015. The 1.9 percentage point decrease was primarily due to the unfavorable impact of our repatriation of historical foreign earnings in fiscal 2015, partially offset by non-deductible expenses related to the Green Giant divestiture in fiscal 2016. Our effective tax rate excluding certain items affecting comparability was 29.8 percent in fiscal 2016 compared to 30.5 percent in fiscal 2015 (see the Non-GAAP Measures section below for a description of our use of measures not defined by GAAP). After-tax earnings from joint ventures for fiscal 2016 increased to $88 million compared to $84 million in fiscal 2015 primarily driven by favorable input costs in fiscal 2016, favorable product mix for H agen-Dazs Japan, Inc. (HDJ), and lapping an impairment charge of $3 million at Cereal Partners Worldwide (CPW) in South Africa in fiscal 2015, partially offset by unfavorable foreign currency. On a constant-currency basis, after-tax earnings from joint ventures increased 12 percent (see the Non-GAAP Measures section below for a description of our use of these measures not defined by GAAP). The change in net sales for each joint venture is set forth in the following table: As Reported Constant-Currency Basis Fiscal 2016 vs. 2015 Fiscal 2016 vs. 2015 CPW (12 )% Flat HDJ Flat 5 Joint Ventures (10 )% 1 % 21 Table of Contents The components of our joint ventures net sales growth are shown in the following table: Fiscal 2016 vs. Fiscal 2015 CPW HDJ Contributions from volume growth (a) Flat 11 pts Net price realization and mix Flat (6) pts Foreign currency exchange (12) pts (5) pts Net sales growth (12) pts Flat (a) Measured in tons based on the stated weight of our product shipments. Average diluted shares outstanding decreased by 7 million in fiscal 2016 from fiscal 2015 due to share repurchases, partially offset by option exercises. FISCAL 2015 CONSOLIDATED RESULTS OF OPERATIONS Fiscal 2015 had 53 weeks compared to 52 weeks in fiscal 2014. Fiscal 2015 net sales declined 2 percent to $17,630 million and increased 1 percent on a constant-currency basis. Operating profit of $2,077 million was 30 percent lower than fiscal 2014. Total segment operating profit was $3,035 million, 4 percent lower than fiscal 2014 and 2 percent lower on a constant-currency basis. In fiscal 2015, net earnings attributable to General Mills were $1,221 million, down 33 percent from $1,824 million in fiscal 2014, and we reported diluted EPS of $1.97 in fiscal 2015, down 30 percent from $2.83 in fiscal 2014. Fiscal 2015 results include restructuring-related charges, an indefinite-lived intangible asset impairment charge, tax impacts from the repatriation of historical foreign earnings, losses from the mark-to-market valuation of certain commodity positions and grain inventories, integration costs resulting from the acquisition of Annie s, and the impact of Venezuela currency devaluation. Fiscal 2014 results include the impact of Venezuela currency devaluation, a gain on the divestiture of certain grain elevators, losses from the mark-to-market valuation of certain commodity positions and grain inventories, and restructuring charges related to our fiscal 2012 productivity and cost savings plan. Diluted EPS excluding these items affecting comparability totaled $2.86 in fiscal 2015, up 1 percent from $2.82 in fiscal 2014 (see the Non-GAAP Measures section below for a description of our use of these measures not defined by GAAP). Net sales declined 2 percent to $17,630 million in fiscal 2015 from $17,910 in fiscal 2014. The components of net sales growth are shown in the following table: Fiscal 2015 vs. 2014 Contributions from volume growth (a) (1) pt Net price realization and mix 2 pts Foreign currency exchange (3) pts Net sales growth (2) pts (a) Measured in tons based on the stated weight of our product shipments. The 53 rd week in fiscal 2015 contributed approximately 1 percentage point of net sales growth, reflecting 1 percentage point of growth from volume. Cost of sales increased $141 million in fiscal 2015 to $11,681 million. In fiscal 2015, we recorded a $90 million net increase in cost of sales related to mark-to-market valuation of certain commodity positions and grain inventories, compared to a net decrease of $49 million in fiscal 2014. In fiscal 2015, we recorded $60 million of restructuring charges in cost of sales. Product mix drove a $17 million increase in cost of sales. We also recorded a $3 million foreign exchange loss in fiscal 2015 related to Venezuela currency devaluation compared to a $23 million loss in fiscal 2014. Lower volume drove a $68 million decrease in cost of sales in fiscal 2015. We recorded $13 million of restructuring initiative project-related cash costs in cost of sales in fiscal 2015. 22 Table of Contents Gross margin declined 7 percent in fiscal 2015 versus fiscal 2014. Gross margin as a percent of net sales of 34 percent decreased 190 basis points compared to fiscal 2014. SG&A expenses decreased $146 million in fiscal 2015 versus fiscal 2014 primarily due to a 5 percent decrease in advertising and media expense, and savings from Project Catalyst and our other cost management initiatives. In fiscal 2015, we recorded a $5 million charge in SG&A expenses related to Venezuela currency devaluation compared to a $39 million charge in fiscal 2014. In addition, we recorded $16 million of integration costs in SG&A expenses in fiscal 2015 related to our acquisition of Annie s. SG&A expenses as a percent of net sales decreased 50 basis points compared to fiscal 2014. There were no divestitures in fiscal 2015. During fiscal 2014, we recorded a divestiture gain of $66 million related to the sale of certain grain elevators in our U.S. Retail segment. Restructuring, impairment, and other exit costs totaled $544 million in fiscal 2015 compared to $4 million in fiscal 2014. In fiscal 2015, we made a strategic decision to redirect certain resources supporting our Green Giant business in our U.S. Retail segment to other businesses within the segment. As a result, we recorded a $260 million impairment charge in fiscal 2015 related to the Green Giant brand intangible asset. Restructuring charges recorded in restructuring, impairment, and other exit costs were $284 million in fiscal 2015 compared to $4 million in fiscal 2014. Total charges associated with our restructuring initiatives recognized in fiscal 2015 and 2014 consisted of the following: As Reported In Millions Fiscal 2015 Fiscal 2014 Charge Cash Charge Cash Total Century (a) $ 181.8 $ 12.0 $ $ Catalyst 148.4 45.0 International 13.9 6.5 1.0 6.0 Other (0.6 ) 0.1 2.6 16.4 Total restructuring charges (a) 343.5 63.6 3.6 22.4 Project-related costs recorded in costs of sales 13.2 9.7 Restructuring charges and project-related costs $ 356.7 $ 73.3 $ 3.6 $ 22.4 (a) Includes $59.6 million of restructuring charges recorded in cost of sales during fiscal 2015. Please refer to Note 4 to the Consolidated Financial Statements in Item 8 of this report for more information regarding our restructuring activities. Interest, net for fiscal 2015 totaled $315 million, $13 million higher than fiscal 2014, primarily driven by higher average debt balances, partially offset by changes in the mix of debt. Our consolidated effective tax rate for fiscal 2015 of 33.3 percent was consistent with fiscal 2014. The 4.5 percentage point impact resulting from the repatriation of $606 million of historical foreign earnings in fiscal 2015 was offset by changes in earnings mix by country, certain favorable discrete items, and favorable state tax rate changes. Our effective tax rate excluding certain items affecting comparability was 30.5 percent in fiscal 2015 compared to 32.2 percent in fiscal 2014 (see the Non-GAAP Measures section below for a description of our use of measures not defined by GAAP). 23 Table of Contents After-tax earnings from joint ventures for fiscal 2015 decreased to $84 million compared to $90 million in fiscal 2014 primarily driven by unfavorable foreign currency exchange and an asset impairment charge of $3 million at CPW in South Africa. On a constant-currency basis, after-tax earnings from joint ventures were flat (see the Non-GAAP Measures section below for a description of our use of this measure not defined by GAAP).

RESULTS OF SEGMENT OPERATIONS Our businesses are organized into three operating segments: U.S. Retail; International; and Convenience Stores and Foodservice. In fiscal 2015, we changed how we assess segment operating performance to exclude the asset and liability remeasurement impact from hyperinflationary economies. This impact is now included in unallocated corporate items. All periods presented have been changed to conform to this presentation. The following tables provide the dollar amount and percentage of net sales and operating profit from each segment for fiscal years 2016, 2015, and 2014: Fiscal Year 2016 2015 2014 In Millions Dollars Percent of Total Dollars Percent of Total Dollars Percent of Total Net Sales U.S. Retail $ 10,007.1 60 % $ 10,507.0 60 % $ 10,604.9 59 % International 4,632.2 28 5,128.2 29 5,385.9 30 Convenience Stores and Foodservice 1,923.8 12 1,995.1 11 1,918.8 11 Total $ 16,563.1 100 % $ 17,630.3 100 % $ 17,909.6 100 % Segment Operating Profit U.S. Retail $ 2,179.0 72 % $ 2,159.3 71 % $ 2,311.5 73 % International 441.6 15 522.6 17 535.1 17 Convenience Stores and Foodservice 378.9 13 353.1 12 307.3 10 Total $ 2,999.5 100 % $ 3,035.0 100 % $ 3,153.9 100 % 24 Table of Contents Segment operating profit excludes unallocated corporate items, net gain on divestitures, and restructuring, impairment, and other exit costs because these items affecting operating profit are centrally managed at the corporate level and are excluded from the measure of segment profitability reviewed by our executive management. U.S. RETAIL SEGMENT In fiscal 2015, we realigned certain operating units within our U.S. Retail operating segment. We also changed the name of our Yoplait operating unit to Yogurt and our Big G operating unit to Cereal. Frozen Foods transitioned into Meals and Baking Products. Small Planet Foods transitioned into Snacks, Cereal, and Meals. The Yogurt operating unit was unchanged. We revised the amounts previously reported in the net sales and net sales percentage change by operating unit within our U.S. Retail segment to conform to the new operating unit structure. These realignments had no effect on previously reported consolidated net sales, operating segments net sales, operating profit, segment operating profit, net earnings attributable to General Mills, or EPS. In addition, results from the acquired Annie business are included in the Meals and Snacks operating units. Our U.S. Retail segment reflects business with a wide variety of grocery stores, mass merchandisers, membership stores, natural food chains, drug, dollar and discount chains, and e-commerce grocery providers operating throughout the United States. Our product categories in this business segment are ready-to-eat cereals, refrigerated yogurt, soup, meal kits, refrigerated and frozen dough products, dessert and baking mixes, frozen pizza and pizza snacks, grain, fruit and savory snacks, and a wide variety of organic products including meal kits, granola bars, and cereal. U.S. Retail net sales were as follows: Fiscal 2016 Fiscal 2016 vs. 2015 Percentage Change Fiscal 2015 Fiscal 2015 vs. 2014 Percentage Change Fiscal 2014 Net sales (in millions) $ 10,007.1 (5)% $ 10,507.0 (1)% $ 10,604.9 Contributions from volume growth (a) (7) pts (1) pt Net price realization and mix 2 pts Flat (a) Measured in tons based on the stated weight of our product shipments. The net impact of acquisitions and divestitures, primarily Green Giant and Annie s, decreased net sales growth by 2 percentage points in fiscal 2016, reflecting 3 percentage points of decline from volume. The 53 rd week in fiscal 2015 contributed approximately 1 percentage point of net sales decline in fiscal 2016, reflecting 2 percentage points of decline from volume. In fiscal 2015, the acquisition of Annie added 1 percentage point of net sales growth, reflecting 1 percentage point of growth from volume. The 53 rd week contributed approximately 1 percentage point of net sales growth in fiscal 2015, reflecting 1 percentage point of growth from volume. Net sales for our U.S. retail operating units are shown in the following table: Fiscal Year In Millions 2016 2015 2014 Meals (a) $ 2,393.9 $ 2,674.3 $ 2,772.4 Cereal 2,312.8 2,330.1 2,410.2 Snacks (a) 2,094.3 2,134.4 1,997.8 Baking Products 1,903.4 1,969.8 2,096.1 Yogurt and other 1,302.7 1,398.4 1,328.4 Total $ 10,007.1 $ 10,507.0 $ 10,604.9 (a) Fiscal 2016 net sales for the Meals and Snacks operating units include an additional month of results from Annie s. 25 Table of Contents U.S. Retail net sales percentage change by operating unit are shown in the following table: Fiscal 2016 vs. 2015 Fiscal 2015 vs. 2014 Meals (a) (10 )% (4 )% Yogurt (7 ) 5 Baking Products (3 ) (6 ) Snacks (a) (2 ) 7 Cereal (1 ) (3 ) Total (5 )% (1 )% (a) The impact due to an additional month of results from Annie was not material to the Meals and Snacks operating units. The impact to fiscal 2016 net sales growth for the U.S. Retail segment was not material. Segment operating profit of $2,179 million in fiscal 2016 increased $20 million, or 1 percent, from fiscal 2015. The increase was primarily driven by high levels of promotional expense in fiscal 2015, cost savings from Project Catalyst and other cost management initiatives, a decrease in media and advertising expenses, and lower supply chain costs, partially offset by the net impact of the Green Giant divestiture and Annie acquisition. Segment operating profit of $2,159 million in fiscal 2015 declined $152 million, or 7 percent, from fiscal 2014. The decrease was primarily driven by lower volume and an increase in supply chain costs, partially offset by a 6 percent reduction in media and advertising expenses. INTERNATIONAL SEGMENT Our International segment consists of retail and foodservice businesses outside of the United States. Our product categories include ready-to-eat cereals, shelf stable and frozen vegetables, meal kits, refrigerated and frozen dough products, dessert and baking mixes, frozen pizza snacks, refrigerated yogurt, grain and fruit snacks, and super-premium ice cream and frozen desserts. We also sell super-premium ice cream and frozen desserts directly to consumers through owned retail shops. Our International segment also includes products manufactured in the United States for export, mainly to Caribbean and Latin American markets, as well as products we manufacture for sale to our international joint ventures. Revenues from export activities and franchise fees are reported in the region or country where the end customer is located. International net sales were as follows: Fiscal 2016 Fiscal 2016 vs. 2015 Percentage Change Fiscal 2015 Fiscal 2015 vs. 2014 Percentage Change Fiscal 2014 Net sales (in millions) $ 4,632.2 (10)% $ 5,128.2 (5)% $ 5,385.9 Contributions from volume growth (a) 3 pts Flat Net price realization and mix Flat 6 pts Foreign currency exchange (13) pts (11) pts (a) Measured in tons based on the stated weight of our product shipments. The impact of acquisition and divestitures, primarily Green Giant, decreased net sales growth by 1 percentage point in fiscal 2016. The 53 rd week in fiscal 2015 contributed approximately 1 percentage point of net sales decline in fiscal 2016, reflecting 1 percentage point of decline from volume. The 53 rd week contributed approximately 1 percentage point of net sales growth in fiscal 2015, reflecting 1 percentage point of growth from volume. 26 Table of Contents Net sales for our International segment by geographic region are shown in the following table: Fiscal Year In Millions 2016 2015 2014 Europe (a) $ 1,998.0 $ 2,126.5 $ 2,188.8 Canada 929.5 1,105.1 1,195.3 Asia/Pacific 995.7 1,023.5 981.8 Latin America 709.0 873.1 1,020.0 Total $ 4,632.2 $ 5,128.2 $ 5,385.9 (a) Fiscal 2016 net sales for the Europe region include an additional month of results from Yoplait SAS.

(b) Fiscal 2016 percentage change in net sales as reported for the Europe region includes 3 percentage points of growth due to an additional month of results from Yoplait SAS. The impact to fiscal 2016 net sales growth for the International segment was not material. Segment operating profit for fiscal 2016 declined 15 percent to $442 million from $523 million in fiscal 2015, primarily driven by unfavorable foreign currency exchange, an increase in SG&A expenses, and the impact of the Green Giant divestiture. International segment operating profit decreased 3 percent on a constant-currency basis in fiscal 2016 compared to fiscal 2015 (see the Non-GAAP Measures section below for our use of this measure). Segment operating profit for fiscal 2015 declined 2 percent to $523 million from $535 million in fiscal 2014, primarily driven by unfavorable foreign currency exchange and higher input costs, partially offset by favorable net price realization and mix. International segment operating profit increased 9 percent on a constant-currency basis in fiscal 2015 compared to fiscal 2014 (see the Non-GAAP Measures section below for our use of this measure). CONVENIENCE STORES AND FOODSERVICE SEGMENT In our Convenience Stores and Foodservice segment our major product categories are ready-to-eat cereals, snacks, refrigerated yogurt, frozen meals, unbaked and fully baked frozen dough products, and baking mixes. Many products we sell are branded to the consumer and nearly all are branded to our customers. We sell to distributors and operators in many customer channels including foodservice, convenience stores, vending, and supermarket bakeries. Substantially all of this segment operations are located in the United States. 27 Table of Contents Convenience Stores and Foodservice net sales were as follows: Fiscal 2016 Fiscal 2016 vs. 2015 Percentage Change 2015 Fiscal 2015 vs. 2014 Percentage Change Fiscal 2014 Net sales (in millions) $ 1,923.8 (4)% $ 1,995.1 4% $ 1,918.8 Contributions from volume growth (a) (3) pts 1 pt Net price realization and mix (1) pt 3 pts Foreign currency exchange NM NM (a) Measured in tons based on the stated weight of our product shipments.

In fiscal 2015, the 53 rd week contributed approximately 2 percentage points of net sales growth, reflecting 2 percentage points of growth from volume. In fiscal 2016, segment operating profit was $379 million, up 7 percent from $353 million in fiscal 2015 primarily driven by favorable product mix and cost savings from Project Catalyst and other cost management initiatives. In fiscal 2015, segment operating profit was up 15 percent from $307 million in fiscal 2014 primarily driven by favorable net price realization and mix and higher volume. UNALLOCATED CORPORATE ITEMS Unallocated corporate items include corporate overhead expenses, variances to planned domestic employee benefits and incentives, contributions to the General Mills Foundation, asset and liability remeasurement impact of hyperinflationary economies, restructuring initiative project-related costs, and other items that are not part of our measurement of segment operating performance. This includes gains and losses from the mark-to-market valuation of certain commodity positions until passed back to our operating segments in accordance with our policy as discussed in Note 7 to the Consolidated Financial Statements in Item 8 of this report. For fiscal 2016, unallocated corporate expense totaled $289 million compared to $414 million last year. In fiscal 2016, we recorded a $63 million net decrease in expense related to mark-to-market valuation of certain commodity positions and grain inventories compared to a $90 million net increase in expense in the prior year. In addition, we recorded $78 million of restructuring charges, and $58 million of restructuring initiative project-related costs in cost of sales in fiscal 2016, compared to $60 million of restructuring charges and $13 million of restructuring initiative project-related costs in cost of sales in fiscal 2015. We recorded an $8 million foreign exchange loss related to the remeasurement of assets and liabilities of our Venezuelan subsidiary in fiscal 2015. We also recorded $16 million of integration costs resulting from the acquisition of Annie in fiscal 2015. The decrease in unallocated corporate expense also reflects cost savings from Project Catalyst and other cost management initiatives. For fiscal 2015, unallocated corporate expense totaled $414 million compared to $258 million in fiscal 2014. In fiscal 2015, we recorded a $90 million net increase in expense related to mark-to-market valuation of certain commodity positions and grain inventories compared to a $49 million net decrease in fiscal 2014. In addition, we recorded $60 million of restructuring charges and $13 million of restructuring initiative project-related costs in cost of sales in fiscal 2015. In fiscal 2015, we recorded an $8 million foreign exchange loss related to the remeasurement of assets and liabilities of our Venezuelan subsidiary compared to $62 million in fiscal 2014. We also recorded $16 million of integration costs resulting from the acquisition of Annie in fiscal 2015. Venezuela is a highly inflationary economy and as such, we remeasured the value of the assets and liabilities of our former Venezuelan subsidiary based on the exchange rate at which we expected to remit dividends in U.S. dollars from the SIMADI market. In fiscal 2015, we recorded an $8 million foreign currency exchange loss related to remeasurement. In fiscal 2016, we sold our General Mills de Venezuela CA subsidiary to a third party and exited our business in Venezuela. As a result of this transaction, we recorded a loss on the sale of $38 million pre-tax. 28 Table of Contents In fiscal 2015, we changed how we assess segment operating performance to exclude the asset and liability remeasurement impact from hyperinflationary economies. This impact is now included in unallocated corporate items. All periods presented have been changed to conform to this presentation. IMPACT OF INFLATION Our gross margin performance in fiscal 2016 reflects the impact of 2 percent input cost inflation, primarily on commodity inputs. We expect input cost inflation of 2 percent in fiscal 2017. We attempt to minimize the effects of inflation through HMM, planning, and operating practices. Our risk management practices are discussed in Item 7A of this report. LIQUIDITY The primary source of our liquidity is cash flow from operations. Over the most recent three-year period, our operations have generated $7.7 billion in cash. A substantial portion of this operating cash flow has been returned to shareholders through share repurchases and dividends. We also use cash from operations to fund our capital expenditures and acquisitions. We typically use a combination of cash, notes payable, and long-term debt to finance significant acquisitions and major capital expansions. As of May 29, 2016, we had $645 million of cash and cash equivalents held in foreign jurisdictions, which will be used to fund foreign operations and acquisitions. There is currently no need to repatriate these funds in order to meet domestic funding obligations or scheduled cash distributions. If we choose to repatriate historical earnings held in foreign jurisdictions, we intend to do so only in a tax-neutral manner. Cash Flows from Operations Fiscal Year In Millions 2016 2015 2014 Net earnings, including earnings attributable to redeemable and noncontrolling interests $ 1,736.8 $ 1,259.4 $ 1,861.3 Depreciation and amortization 608.1 588.3 585.4 After-tax earnings from joint ventures (88.4 ) (84.3 ) (89.6 ) Distributions of earnings from joint ventures 75.1 72.6 90.5 Stock-based compensation 89.8 106.4 108.5 Deferred income taxes 120.6 25.3 172.5 Tax benefit on exercised options (94.1 ) (74.6 ) (69.3 ) Pension and other postretirement benefit plan contributions (47.8 ) (49.5 ) (49.7 ) Pension and other postretirement benefit plan costs 118.1 91.3 124.1 Divestitures (gain) (148.2 ) (65.5 ) Restructuring, impairment, and other exit costs 107.2 531.1 (18.8 ) Changes in current assets and liabilities, excluding the effects of acquisitions and divestitures 258.2 214.7 (32.2 ) Other, net (105.6 ) (137.9 ) (76.2 ) Net cash provided by operating activities $ 2,629.8 $ 2,542.8 $ 2,541.0 In fiscal 2016, our operations generated $2.6 billion of cash compared to $2.5 billion in fiscal 2015. The $477 million increase in net earnings included a $96 million change in deferred income taxes and a $148 million net gain on divestitures and was also offset by a $424 million decrease in non-cash restructuring charges. The $43 million change in current assets and liabilities was primarily driven by the timing of accounts payable including the impact of longer terms offset by the timing of inventory build. We strive to grow core working capital at or below the rate of growth in our net sales. For fiscal 2016, core working capital decreased 41 percent, primarily due to an increase in accounts payable, largely driven by longer payables terms and a decrease in inventory, compared to a net sales decline of 6 percent. In fiscal 2015, core working capital decreased 13 percent, compared to a net sales decline of 2 percent, and in fiscal 2014, core working capital decreased 9 percent, compared to net sales growth of 1 percent. 29 Table of Contents In fiscal 2015, our operations generated $2.5 billion of cash, flat compared to fiscal 2014. The $247 million change in current assets and liabilities was primarily driven by the timing of trade and promotion accruals, changes in tax accruals, and changes in derivative positions. This was largely offset by lower net earnings, which included a $260 million non-cash impairment charge, $271 million of non-cash restructuring charges, and a $147 million change in net deferred income taxes.

We invested $729 million in land, buildings, and equipment in fiscal 2016, $17 million more than last year. In fiscal 2016, we received proceeds of $828 million from the divestitures of certain businesses, primarily Green Giant. In fiscal 2015, we acquired Annie for an aggregate purchase price of $809 million, net of $12 million of cash acquired. In fiscal 2015, cash used by investing activities increased by $1.0 billion from fiscal 2014. We invested $712 million in land, buildings, and equipment in fiscal 2015, $49 million more than in fiscal 2014. In fiscal 2015, we acquired Annie s. We made $102 million of investments in affiliates, primarily CPW, in fiscal 2015. In fiscal 2014, we sold certain grain elevators for $124 million in cash. We expect capital expenditures to be approximately $734 million in fiscal 2017. These expenditures will fund initiatives that are expected to fuel International growth, support innovative products, and continue HMM initiatives throughout the supply chain. 30 Table of Contents Cash Flows from Financing Activities Fiscal Year In Millions 2016 2015 2014 Change in notes payable $ (323.8 ) $ (509.8 ) $ 572.9 Issuance of long-term debt 542.5 2,253.2 1,673.0 Payment of long-term debt (1,000.4 ) (1,145.8 ) (1,444.8 ) Proceeds from common stock issued on exercised options 171.9 163.7 108.1 Tax benefit on exercised options 94.1 74.6 69.3 Purchases of common stock for treasury (606.7 ) (1,161.9 ) (1,745.3 ) Dividends paid (1,071.7 ) (1,017.7 ) (983.3 ) Addition of noncontrolling interest 17.6 Distributions to noncontrolling and redeemable interest holders (84.3 ) (25.0 ) (77.4 ) Other, net (7.2 ) (16.1 ) (14.2 ) Net cash used by financing activities $ (2,285.6 ) $ (1,384.8 ) $ (1,824.1 ) Net cash used by financing activities increased by $901 million in fiscal 2016. We had $1.4 billion less net debt issuances in fiscal 2016 than the prior year. For more information on our debt issuances and payments, please refer to Note 8 to the Consolidated Financial Statements in Item 8 of this report. During fiscal 2016, we received $172 million in proceeds from common stock issued on exercised options compared to $164 million in fiscal 2015, an increase of $8 million. During fiscal 2014, we received $108 million in proceeds from common stock issued on exercised options. In May 2014, our Board of Directors authorized the repurchase of up to 100 million shares of our common stock. Purchases under the authorization can be made in the open market or in privately negotiated transactions, including the use of call options and other derivative instruments, Rule 10b5-1 trading plans, and accelerated repurchase programs. The authorization has no specified termination date. During fiscal 2016, we repurchased 11 million shares of our common stock for $607 million. During fiscal 2015, we repurchased 22 million shares of our common stock for $1,162 million. During fiscal 2014, we repurchased 36 million shares of our common stock for $1,745 million. Dividends paid in fiscal 2016 totaled $1,072 million, or $1.78 per share, a 7 percent per share increase from fiscal 2015. Dividends paid in fiscal 2015 totaled $1,018 million, or $1.67 per share, an 8 percent per share increase from fiscal 2014 dividends of $1.55 per share. Selected Cash Flows from Joint Ventures Selected cash flows from our joint ventures are set forth in the following table: Fiscal Year Inflow (Outflow), in Millions 2016 2015 2014 Repayments from (advances to) joint ventures, net $ 63.9 $ (102.4 ) $ (54.9 ) Dividends received 75.1 72.6 90.5 31 Table of Contents CAPITAL RESOURCES Total capital consisted of the following: In Millions May 29, 2016 May 31, 2015 Notes payable $ 269.8 $ 615.8 Current portion of long-term debt 1,103.4 1,000.4 Long-term debt 7,057.7 7,575.3 Total debt 8,430.9 9,191.5 Redeemable interest 845.6 778.9 Noncontrolling interests 376.9 396.0 Stockholders equity 4,930.2 4,996.7 Total capital $ 14,583.6 $ 15,363.1 The following table details the fee-paid committed and uncommitted credit lines we had available as of May 29, 2016: In Billions Facility Amount Borrowed Amount Credit facility expiring: May 2021 $ 2.7 $ June 2019 0.2 0.1 Total committed credit facilities 2.9 0.1 Uncommitted credit facilities 0.4 0.1 Total committed and uncommitted credit facilities $ 3.3 $ 0.2 In May 2016, we entered into a $2.7 billion fee-paid committed credit facility that is scheduled to expire in May 2021. Concurrent with the execution of this credit facility, we terminated our $1.7 billion and $1.0 billion credit facilities. In June 2014, our subsidiary, Yoplait S.A.S. entered into a 200.0 million fee-paid committed credit facility that is scheduled to expire in June 2019. To ensure availability of funds, we maintain bank credit lines sufficient to cover our outstanding notes payable. Commercial paper is a continuing source of short-term financing. We have commercial paper programs available to us in the United States and Europe. We also have uncommitted and asset-backed credit lines that support our foreign operations. The credit facilities contain several covenants, including a requirement to maintain a fixed charge coverage ratio of at least 2.5 times. Certain of our long-term debt agreements, our credit facilities, and our noncontrolling interests contain restrictive covenants. As of May 29, 2016, we were in compliance with all of these covenants. We have $1,103 million of long-term debt maturing in the next 12 months that is classified as current, including $1,000 million of 5.7 percent fixed rate notes due February 2017. We believe that cash flows from operations, together with available short- and long-term debt financing, will be adequate to meet our liquidity and capital needs for at least the next 12 months. As of May 29, 2016, our total debt, including the impact of derivative instruments designated as hedges, was 78 percent in fixed-rate and 22 percent in floating-rate instruments, compared to 72 percent in fixed-rate and 28 percent in floating-rate instruments on May 31, 2015. 32 Table of Contents Return on average total capital was 12.9 percent in fiscal 2016 compared to 9.1 percent in fiscal 2015. Improvement in return on adjusted average total capital is one of our key performance measures (see the Non-GAAP Measures section below for our discussion of this measure, which is not defined by GAAP). Adjusted return on average total capital increased 10 basis points from 11.2 percent in fiscal 2015 to 11.3 percent in fiscal 2016 as fiscal 2016 earnings increased. On a constant-currency basis, adjusted return on average total capital increased 40 basis points. We also believe that our fixed charge coverage ratio and the ratio of operating cash flow to debt are important measures of our financial strength. Our fixed charge coverage ratio in fiscal 2016 was 7.40 compared to 5.54 in fiscal 2015. The measure increased from fiscal 2015 as earnings before income taxes and after-tax earnings from joint ventures increased by $642 million in fiscal 2016. Our operating cash flow to debt ratio increased 3.5 percentage points to 31.2 percent in fiscal 2016, driven by a decrease in total debt. We have a 51 percent controlling interest in Yoplait SAS and a 50 percent interest in Yoplait Marques SNC and Libert Marques S rl. Sodiaal holds the remaining interests in each of these entities. We consolidate these entities into our consolidated financial statements. We record Sodiaal 50 percent interest in Yoplait Marques SNC and Libert Marques S rl as noncontrolling interests, and its 49 percent interest in Yoplait SAS as a redeemable interest on our Consolidated Balance Sheets. These euro- and Canadian dollar-denominated interests are reported in U.S. dollars on our Consolidated Balance Sheets. Sodiaal has the ability to put all or a portion of its redeemable interest to us at fair value once per year, up to three times before December 2024. As of May 29, 2016, the redemption value of the redeemable interest was $846 million which approximates its fair value. The third-party holder of the General Mills Cereals, LLC (GMC) Class A Interests receives quarterly preferred distributions from available net income based on the application of a floating preferred return rate to the holder capital account balance established in the most recent mark-to-market valuation (currently $252 million). On June 1, 2015, the floating preferred return rate on GMC Class A Interests was reset to the sum of three-month LIBOR plus 125 basis points. The preferred return rate is adjusted every three years through a negotiated agreement with the Class A Interest holder or through a remarketing auction. We have an option to purchase the Class A Interests for consideration equal to the then current capital account value, plus any unpaid preferred return and the prescribed make-whole amount. If we purchase these interests, any change in the third-party holder capital account from its original value will be charged directly to retained earnings and will increase or decrease the net earnings used to calculate EPS in that period. OFF-BALANCE SHEET ARRANGEMENTS AND CONTRACTUAL OBLIGATIONS As of May 29, 2016, we have issued guarantees and comfort letters of $383 million for the debt and other obligations of consolidated subsidiaries, and guarantees and comfort letters of $239 million for the debt and other obligations of non-consolidated affiliates, mainly CPW. In addition, off-balance sheet arrangements are generally limited to the future payments under non-cancelable operating leases, which totaled $398 million as of May 29, 2016. As of May 29, 2016, we had invested in five variable interest entities (VIEs). None of our VIEs are material to our results of operations, financial condition, or liquidity as of and for the fiscal year ended May 29, 2016. Our defined benefit plans in the United States are subject to the requirements of the Pension Protection Act (PPA). In the future, the PPA may require us to make additional contributions to our domestic plans. We do not expect to be required to make any contributions in fiscal 2017. 33 Table of Contents The following table summarizes our future estimated cash payments under existing contractual obligations, including payments due by period: Payments Due by Fiscal Year In Millions Total 2017 2018 -19 2020 -21 2022 and Thereafter Long-term debt (a) $ 8,190.2 $ 1,103.0 $ 1,754.2 $ 1,611.6 $3,721.4 Accrued interest 90.4 90.4 Operating leases (b) 397.6 107.9 150.7 89.2 49.8 Capital leases 2.7 0.9 1.3 0.4 0.1 Purchase obligations (c) 3,082.1 1,955.9 603.7 497.4 25.1 Total contractual obligations 11,763.0 3,258.1 2,509.9 2,198.6 3,796.4 Other long-term obligations (d) 1,957.0 Total long-term obligations $ 13,720.0 $ 3,258.1 $ 2,509.9 $ 2,198.6 $3,796.4 (a) Amounts represent the expected cash payments of our long-term debt and do not include $2 million for capital leases or $31 million for net unamortized debt issuance costs, premiums and discounts, and fair value adjustments. (b) Operating leases represents the minimum rental commitments under non-cancelable operating leases. (c) The majority of the purchase obligations represent commitments for raw material and packaging to be utilized in the normal course of business and for consumer marketing spending commitments that support our brands. For purposes of this table, arrangements are considered purchase obligations if a contract specifies all significant terms, including fixed or minimum quantities to be purchased, a pricing structure, and approximate timing of the transaction. Most arrangements are cancelable without a significant penalty and with short notice (usually 30 days). Any amounts reflected on the Consolidated Balance Sheets as accounts payable and accrued liabilities are excluded from the table above. (d) The fair value of our foreign exchange, equity, commodity, and grain derivative contracts with a payable position to the counterparty was $44 million as of May 29, 2016, based on fair market values as of that date. Future changes in market values will impact the amount of cash ultimately paid or received to settle those instruments in the future. Other long-term obligations mainly consist of liabilities for accrued compensation and benefits, including the underfunded status of certain of our defined benefit pension, other postretirement benefit, and postemployment benefit plans, and miscellaneous liabilities. We expect to pay $22 million of benefits from our unfunded postemployment benefit plans and $14 million of deferred compensation in fiscal 2017. We are unable to reliably estimate the amount of these payments beyond fiscal 2017. As of May 29, 2016, our total liability for uncertain tax positions and accrued interest and penalties was $209 million. SIGNIFICANT ACCOUNTING ESTIMATES For a complete description of our significant accounting policies, see Note 2 to the Consolidated Financial Statements in Item 8 of this report. Our significant accounting estimates are those that have a meaningful impact on the reporting of our financial condition and results of operations. These estimates include our accounting for promotional expenditures, valuation of long-lived assets, intangible assets, redeemable interest, stock-based compensation, income taxes, and defined benefit pension, other postretirement benefit, and postemployment benefit plans. Promotional Expenditures Our promotional activities are conducted through our customers and directly or indirectly with end consumers. These activities include: payments to customers to perform merchandising activities on our behalf, such as advertising or in-store displays; discounts to our list prices to lower retail shelf prices; payments to gain distribution of new products; coupons, contests, and other incentives; and media and advertising expenditures. The recognition of these costs requires estimation of customer participation and performance levels. These estimates are based on the forecasted customer sales, the timing and forecasted costs of promotional activities, and other factors. Differences between estimated expenses and actual costs are recognized as a change in management estimate in a subsequent period. Our accrued trade, coupon, and consumer marketing liabilities were $564 million as of May 29, 2016, and $565 million as of May 31, 2015. Because our total promotional expenditures (including amounts classified as a reduction of revenues) are significant, if our estimates are inaccurate we would have to make adjustments in subsequent periods that could have a significant effect on our results of operations. 34 Table of Contents Valuation of Long-Lived Assets We estimate the useful lives of long-lived assets and make estimates concerning undiscounted cash flows to review for impairment whenever events or changes in circumstances indicate that the carrying amount of an asset (or asset group) may not be recoverable. Fair value is measured using discounted cash flows or independent appraisals, as appropriate. Intangible Assets Goodwill and other indefinite-lived intangible assets are not subject to amortization and are tested for impairment annually and whenever events or changes in circumstances indicate that impairment may have occurred. Our estimates of fair value for goodwill impairment testing are determined based on a discounted cash flow model. We use inputs from our long-range planning process to determine growth rates for sales and profits. We also make estimates of discount rates, perpetuity growth assumptions, market comparables, and other factors. We evaluate the useful lives of our other intangible assets, mainly brands, to determine if they are finite or indefinite-lived. Reaching a determination on useful life requires significant judgments and assumptions regarding the future effects of obsolescence, demand, competition, other economic factors (such as the stability of the industry, known technological advances, legislative action that results in an uncertain or changing regulatory environment, and expected changes in distribution channels), the level of required maintenance expenditures, and the expected lives of other related groups of assets. Intangible assets that are deemed to have definite lives are amortized on a straight-line basis, over their useful lives, generally ranging from 4 to 30 years. Our estimate of the fair value of our brand assets is based on a discounted cash flow model using inputs which include projected revenues from our long-range plan, assumed royalty rates that could be payable if we did not own the brands, and a discount rate. As of May 29, 2016, we had $12.9 billion of goodwill and indefinite-lived intangible assets. While we currently believe that the fair value of each intangible exceeds its carrying value and that those intangibles so classified will contribute indefinitely to our cash flows, materially different assumptions regarding future performance of our businesses or a different weighted-average cost of capital could result in material impairment losses and amortization expense. We performed our fiscal 2016 assessment of our intangible assets as of August 31, 2015. As of our annual assessment date, there was no impairment of any of our intangible assets as their related fair values were substantially in excess of the carrying values, except for the Mountain High and Uncle Toby brands. The excess fair value above the carrying value of these brand assets were as follows: In Millions Carrying Value Excess Fair Value Above Carrying Value Mountain High $ 35.4 20 % Uncle Toby $ 52.2 11 % Our Mountain High and Uncle Toby brands have experienced declining business performance, and we will continue to monitor these businesses. Our strategies for fiscal 2017 and fiscal 2018 will focus our growth investments on our brands and platforms with the strongest profitable growth potential. As a result, certain parts of our U.S. Retail segment could experience reduced future sales projections. We performed a sensitivity analysis for certain brand intangible assets and determined that, while not impaired as of May 29, 2016, the Progresso and Food Should Taste Good brands had risk of decreasing coverage. We will continue to monitor these businesses. Redeemable Interest In fiscal 2016, we adjusted the redemption value of Sodiaal redeemable interest in Yoplait SAS based on a discounted cash flow model. The significant assumptions used to estimate the redemption value include projected revenue growth and profitability from our long-range plan, capital spending, depreciation and taxes, foreign currency exchange rates, and a discount rate. As of May 29, 2016, the redemption value of the redeemable interest was $846 million. 35 Table of Contents Stock-based Compensation The valuation of stock options is a significant accounting estimate that requires us to use judgments and assumptions that are likely to have a material impact on our financial statements. Annually, we make predictive assumptions regarding future stock price volatility, employee exercise behavior, dividend yield, and the forfeiture rate. For more information on these assumptions, please refer to Note 11 to the Consolidated Financial Statements in Item 8 of this report. The estimated fair values of stock options granted and the assumptions used for the Black-Scholes option-pricing model were as follows: Fiscal Year 2016 2015 2014 Estimated fair values of stock options granted $7.24 $7.22 $6.03 Assumptions: Risk-free interest rate 2.4% 2.6% 2.6% Expected term 8.5 years 8.5 years 9.0 years Expected volatility 17.6% 17.5% 17.4% Dividend yield 3.2% 3.1% 3.1% The risk-free interest rate for periods during the expected term of the options is based on the U.S. Treasury zero-coupon yield curve in effect at the time of grant. An increase in the expected term by 1 year, leaving all other assumptions constant, would increase the grant date fair value by less than 1 percent. If all other assumptions are held constant, a one percentage point increase in our fiscal 2016 volatility assumption would increase the grant date fair value of our fiscal 2016 option awards by 7 percent. To the extent that actual outcomes differ from our assumptions, we are not required to true up grant-date fair value-based expense to final intrinsic values. However, these differences can impact the classification of cash tax benefits realized upon exercise of stock options, as explained in the following two paragraphs. Furthermore, historical data has a significant bearing on our forward-looking assumptions. Significant variances between actual and predicted experience could lead to prospective revisions in our assumptions, which could then significantly impact the year-over-year comparability of stock-based compensation expense. Any corporate income tax benefit realized upon exercise or vesting of an award in excess of that previously recognized in earnings (referred to as a windfall tax benefit) is presented in the Consolidated Statements of Cash Flows as a financing cash flow. The actual impact on future years financing cash flows will depend, in part, on the volume of employee stock option exercises during a particular year and the relationship between the exercise-date market value of the underlying stock and the original grant-date fair value previously determined for financial reporting purposes. Realized windfall tax benefits are credited to additional paid-in capital within the Consolidated Balance Sheets. Realized shortfall tax benefits (amounts which are less than that previously recognized in earnings) are first offset against the cumulative balance of windfall tax benefits, if any, and then charged directly to income tax expense, potentially resulting in volatility in our consolidated effective income tax rate. We calculated a cumulative amount of windfall tax benefits for the purpose of accounting for future shortfall tax benefits and currently have sufficient cumulative windfall tax benefits to absorb projected arising shortfalls, such that we do not currently expect future earnings to be affected by this provision. However, as employee stock option exercise behavior is not within our control, it is possible that significantly different reported results could occur if different assumptions or conditions were to prevail. 36 Table of Contents Income Taxes We apply a more-likely-than-not threshold to the recognition and derecognition of uncertain tax positions. Accordingly, we recognize the amount of tax benefit that has a greater than 50 percent likelihood of being ultimately realized upon settlement. Future changes in judgment related to the expected ultimate resolution of uncertain tax positions will affect earnings in the quarter of such change. For more information on income taxes, please refer to Note 14 to the Consolidated Financial Statements in Item 8 of this report. Defined Benefit Pension, Other Postretirement Benefit, and Postemployment Benefit Plans We have defined benefit pension plans covering many employees in the United States, Canada, France, and the United Kingdom. We also sponsor plans that provide health care benefits to many of our retirees in the United States, Canada, and Brazil. Under certain circumstances, we also provide accruable benefits to former and inactive employees in the United States, Canada, and Mexico, and members of our Board of Directors, including severance and certain other benefits payable upon death. Please refer to Note 13 to the Consolidated Financial Statements in Item 8 of this report for a description of our defined benefit pension, other postretirement benefit, and postemployment benefit plans. We recognize benefits provided during retirement or following employment over the plan participants active working lives. Accordingly, we make various assumptions to predict and measure costs and obligations many years prior to the settlement of our obligations. Assumptions that require significant management judgment and have a material impact on the measurement of our net periodic benefit expense or income and accumulated benefit obligations include the long-term rates of return on plan assets, the interest rates used to discount the obligations for our benefit plans, and health care cost trend rates. Expected Rate of Return on Plan Assets Our expected rate of return on plan assets is determined by our asset allocation, our historical long-term investment performance, our estimate of future long-term returns by asset class (using input from our actuaries, investment services, and investment managers), and long-term inflation assumptions. We review this assumption annually for each plan; however, our annual investment performance for one particular year does not, by itself, significantly influence our evaluation. Our historical investment returns (compound annual growth rates) for our United States defined benefit pension and other postretirement benefit plan assets were 0.7 percent, 7.8 percent, 6.6 percent, 7.4 percent, and 8.6 percent for the 1, 5, 10, 15, and 20 year periods ended May 29, 2016. On a weighted-average basis, the expected rate of return for all defined benefit plans was 8.53 percent for fiscal 2016, 8.53 percent for fiscal 2015, and 8.53 percent for fiscal 2014. During fiscal 2016, we lowered our weighted-average expected rate of return on plan assets for our principal defined benefit pension and other postretirement plans in the United States to 8.25 percent due to asset changes that decreased investment risk in the portfolio. Lowering the expected long-term rate of return on assets by 100 basis points would increase our net pension and postretirement expense by $64 million for fiscal 2017. A market-related valuation basis is used to reduce year-to-year expense volatility. The market-related valuation recognizes certain investment gains or losses over a five-year period from the year in which they occur. Investment gains or losses for this purpose are the difference between the expected return calculated using the market-related value of assets and the actual return based on the market-related value of assets. Our outside actuaries perform these calculations as part of our determination of annual expense or income. Discount Rates Our discount rate assumptions are determined annually as of the last day of our fiscal year for our defined benefit pension, other postretirement benefit, and postemployment benefit plan obligations. We work with our outside actuaries to determine the timing and amount of expected future cash outflows to plan participants and, using the Aa Above Median corporate bond yield, to develop a forward interest rate curve, including a margin to that index based on our credit risk. This forward interest rate curve is applied to our expected future cash outflows to determine our discount rate assumptions. 37 Table of Contents Our weighted-average discount rates were as follows: Defined Benefit Pension Plans Other Postretirement Benefit Plans Postemployment Benefit Plans Obligations as of May 29, 2016, and fiscal 2017 expense 4.19 % 3.97 % 2.94 % Obligations as of May 31, 2015, and fiscal 2016 expense 4.38 % 4.20 % 3.55 % Fiscal 2015 expense 4.54 % 4.51 % 3.82 % Lowering the discount rates by 100 basis points would increase our net defined benefit pension, other postretirement benefit, and postemployment benefit plan expense for fiscal 2017 by approximately $96 million. All obligation-related experience gains and losses are amortized using a straight-line method over the average remaining service period of active plan participants. Health Care Cost Trend Rates We review our health care cost trend rates annually. Our review is based on data we collect about our health care claims experience and information provided by our actuaries. This information includes recent plan experience, plan design, overall industry experience and projections, and assumptions used by other similar organizations. Our initial health care cost trend rate is adjusted as necessary to remain consistent with this review, recent experiences, and short-term expectations. Our initial health care cost trend rate assumption is 7.5 percent for retirees age 65 and over and 7.3 percent for retirees under age 65 at the end of fiscal 2016. Rates are graded down annually until the ultimate trend rate of 5.0 percent is reached in 2024 for all retirees. The trend rates are applicable for calculations only if the retirees benefits increase as a result of health care inflation. The ultimate trend rate is adjusted annually, as necessary, to approximate the current economic view on the rate of long-term inflation plus an appropriate health care cost premium. Assumed trend rates for health care costs have an important effect on the amounts reported for the other postretirement benefit plans. A one percentage point change in the health care cost trend rate would have the following effects: In Millions One Percentage Point Increase One Percentage Point Decrease Effect on the aggregate of the service and interest cost components in fiscal 2017 $ 3.1 $ (2.7) Effect on the other postretirement accumulated benefit obligation as of May 29, 2016 71.2 (63.8 ) Any arising health care claims cost-related experience gain or loss is recognized in the calculation of expected future claims. Once recognized, experience gains and losses are amortized using a straight-line method over 10 years, resulting in at least the minimum amortization required being recorded. Financial Statement Impact In fiscal 2016, we recorded net defined benefit pension, other postretirement benefit, and postemployment benefit plan expense of $163 million compared to $153 million of expense in fiscal 2015 and $140 million of expense in fiscal 2014. As of May 29, 2016, we had cumulative unrecognized actuarial net losses of $1.9 billion on our defined benefit pension plans and $72 million on our postretirement and postemployment benefit plans, mainly as the result of liability increases from lower interest rates, partially offset by recent increases in the values of plan assets. These unrecognized actuarial net losses will result in increases in our future pension and postretirement benefit expenses because they currently exceed the corridors defined by GAAP. Assumed mortality rates of plan participants are a critical estimate in measuring the expected payments a participant will receive over their lifetime and the amount of expense we recognize. On October 27, 2014, the Society of Actuaries published RP-2014 Mortality Tables and Mortality Improvement Scale MP-2014, which both reflect 38 Table of Contents improved longevity. In fiscal 2015, we adopted the change to the mortality assumptions to remeasure our defined benefit pension plans and other postretirement benefit plans obligations, which increased the total of these obligations by $437 million in fiscal 2015. In addition, these assumptions increased the fiscal 2016 expense associated with these plans by $72 million. Actual future net defined benefit pension, other postretirement benefit, and postemployment benefit plan income or expense will depend on investment performance, changes in future discount rates, changes in health care cost trend rates, and other factors related to the populations participating in these plans. RECENTLY ISSUED ACCOUNTING PRONOUNCEMENTS In March 2016, the Financial Accounting Standards Board (FASB) issued new accounting requirements for the accounting and presentation of stock-based payments. This will result in realized windfall and shortfall tax benefits upon exercise or vesting of stock-based awards being recorded in our Consolidated Statements of Earnings in addition to other presentation changes. The requirements of the new standard are effective for annual reporting periods beginning after December 15, 2016, and interim periods within those annual periods, which for us is the first quarter of fiscal 2018. Early adoption is permitted. We are in the process of analyzing the impact on our results of operations and financial position. In February 2016, the FASB issued new accounting requirements for accounting, presentation and classification of leases. This will result in most leases being capitalized as a right of use asset with a related liability on our Consolidated Balance Sheets. The requirements of the new standard are effective for annual reporting periods beginning after December 15, 2018, and interim periods within those annual periods, which for us is the first quarter of fiscal 2020. We are in the process of analyzing the impact on our results of operations and financial position. In May 2015, the FASB issued new accounting requirements for the presentation of certain investments using the net asset value, providing a practical expedient to exclude such investments from categorization within the fair value hierarchy and separate disclosure. The requirements of the new standard are effective for annual reporting periods beginning after December 15, 2015, and interim periods within those annual periods, which for us is the first quarter of fiscal 2017. We do not expect this guidance to have a material impact on our results of operations or financial position. In April 2015, the FASB issued new accounting requirements which permits reporting entities with a fiscal year-end that does not coincide with a month-end to apply a practical expedient that permits the entity to measure defined benefit plan assets and obligations using the month-end that is closest to the entity fiscal year-end and apply such practical expedient consistently to all plans. The requirements of the new standard are effective for annual reporting periods beginning after December 15, 2015, and interim periods within those annual periods, which for us is the first quarter of fiscal 2017. We do not expect this guidance to have a material impact on our results of operations or financial position. In May 2014, the FASB issued new accounting requirements for the recognition of revenue from contracts with customers. The requirements of the new standard and its subsequent amendments are effective for annual reporting periods beginning after December 15, 2017, and interim periods within those annual periods, which for us is the first quarter of fiscal 2019. We do not expect this guidance to have a material impact on our results of operations or financial position. 39 Table of Contents NON-GAAP MEASURES We have included in this report measures of financial performance that are not defined by GAAP. We believe that these measures provide useful information to investors, and include these measures in other communications to investors. For each of these non-GAAP financial measures, we are providing below a reconciliation of the differences between the non-GAAP measure and the most directly comparable GAAP measure, an explanation of why our management or the Board of Directors believes the non-GAAP measure provides useful information to investors and any additional purposes for which our management or Board of Directors uses the non-GAAP measure. These non-GAAP measures should be viewed in addition to, and not in lieu of, the comparable GAAP measure. Constant-currency Net Sales Growth Rates This measure is used in reporting to our executive management and as a component of the Board of Directors measurement of our performance for incentive compensation purposes. We believe that this measure provides useful information to investors because it provides transparency to underlying performance in our consolidated net sales by excluding the effect that foreign currency exchange rate fluctuations have on the year-to-year comparability given volatility in foreign currency exchange markets. Net sales growth rates on a constant-currency basis are calculated as follows: Fiscal 2016 2015 Percentage change in total net sales (6)% (2)% Impact of foreign currency exchange (4) pts (3) pts Percentage change in total net sales on a constant-currency basis (2)% 1% 40 Table of Contents Diluted EPS Excluding Certain Items Affecting Comparability and Related Constant-currency Growth Rate This measure is used in reporting to our executive management and as a component of the Board of Directors measurement of our performance for incentive compensation purposes. We believe that this measure provides useful information to investors because it is the profitability measure we use to evaluate earnings performance on a comparable year-over-year basis. The adjustments are either items resulting from infrequently occurring events or items that, in management judgment, significantly affect the year-over-year assessment of operating results. The reconciliation of our GAAP measure, diluted EPS, to diluted EPS excluding certain items affecting comparability and the related constant-currency growth rate follows: Fiscal Year Per Share Data 2016 2015 Change 2014 2013 2012 Diluted earnings per share, as reported $ 2.77 $ 1.97 41 % $ 2.83 $ 2.79 $ 2.35 Mark-to-market effects (a) (0.07 ) 0.09 (0.05 ) 0.10 Divestitures gain, net (b) (0.10 ) (0.06 ) Tax items (c) 0.13 (0.13 ) Acquisition integration costs (d) 0.02 0.01 0.01 Venezuela currency devaluation (e) 0.01 0.09 0.03 Restructuring costs (f) 0.26 0.35 0.01 0.02 0.10 Project-related costs (f) 0.06 0.01 Indefinite-lived intangible asset impairment (g) 0.28 Diluted earnings per share, excluding certain items affecting comparability $ 2.92 $ 2.86 2 % $ 2.82 $ 2.72 $ 2.56 Foreign currency exchange impact (3 ) Diluted earnings per share growth, excluding certain items affecting comparability, on a constant-currency basis 5 % (a) See Note 7 to the Consolidated Financial Statements in Item 8 of this report.

Total Segment Operating Profit and Related Constant-currency Growth Rate This measure is used in reporting to our executive management and as a component of the Board of Directors measurement of our performance for incentive compensation purposes. We believe that this measure provides useful information to investors because it is the profitability measure we use to evaluate segment performance. A reconciliation of total segment operating profit to operating profit, the relevant GAAP measure, is included in Note 16 to the Consolidated Financial Statements in Item 8 of this report. 41 Table of Contents Total segment operating profit growth rates on a constant-currency basis are calculated as follows: Fiscal 2016 2015 Percentage change in total segment operating profit as reported (1 ) % (4 ) % Impact of foreign currency exchange (2) pts (2 ) pts Percentage change in total segment operating profit on a constant-currency basis 1 % (2 ) % Constant-currency After-tax Earnings from Joint Ventures Growth Rates We believe that this measure provides useful information to investors because it provides transparency to underlying performance of our joint ventures by excluding the effect that foreign currency exchange rate fluctuations have on year-to-year comparability given volatility in foreign currency exchange markets.
