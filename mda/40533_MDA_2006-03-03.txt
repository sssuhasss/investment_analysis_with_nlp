ITEM 7. MANAGEMENT S DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS OF FINANCIAL CONDITION AND RESULTS OF OPERATIONS (For an overview of the company business groups, including a discussion of products and services provided, see the Business discussion contained in Part I, Item 1, of this Annual Report on Form 10-K.) MANAGEMENT OVERVIEW General Dynamics is a market leader in mission-critical information systems and technologies; land and expeditionary combat systems, armaments and munitions; shipbuilding and marine systems; and business aviation. The company is comprised of four primary business groups Information Systems and Technology, Combat Systems, Marine Systems and Aerospace and a smaller Resources group. General Dynamics primary customers are the U.S. military, other government organizations, the armed forces of allied nations, and a diverse base of corporate and individual buyers of business aircraft.The company operates in two primary markets defense and business aviation. The majority of the company revenues derive from contracts with the U.S. military. The current Administration desire to modernize U.S. military forces coupled with the U.S. military engagement in the Global War on Terrorism has driven steady Department of Defense funding increases since 2001. For fiscal year 2006, the Congress appropriated $411 billion for the Department of Defense, a 33 percent increase in funding since 2001. This amount includes $147 billion for procurement and research and development (R&D) activities, an increase of 43 percent since 2001. Procurement and R&D budgets, also known as investment accounts, provide the majority of the company revenues and, over the past several years, these budget lines have enjoyed sustained increases that demonstrate continued administration and congressional support. For fiscal year 2007, the President has requested that the Congress appropriate $439 billion for the Department of Defense, a 7 percent increase over the 2006 funding. This includes $157 billion for procurement and R&D, an increase of 7 percent over 2006 investment funds. In addition, the President 2007-2011 future year defense program (FYDP) anticipates investment funding growing at a nearly 5 percent compound annual growth rate, led by 9 percent compound annual procurement growth. During this wartime era, defense budgets have evolved to include not only the President initial budget submission, but also supplemental funds requested over the course of the fiscal year. For fiscal year 2006, the Congress has been asked to provide at least $118 billion in supplemental funding, which, if approved, will bring total defense funding for fiscal year 2006 to over $525 billion, an approximately 65 percent increase since 2001. Approximately 20 percent, or $25 billion, of the 2006 supplemental funding request is anticipated for additional investment funding. Looking ahead, the defense budget top line is expected to continue to grow, albeit at a somewhat more moderate rate. Supplemental funding to support ongoing conflicts, in part, is linked to levels of deployed troops and conflict intensity and will likely decrease with a reduction of hostilities. While this introduces some variability into the overall level of future defense spending, based on the recently approved and proposed defense budgets, the company expects the levels of funding available for its programs will likely continue to grow in 2006 and 2007. The importance of many of the companies programs to the future of the U.S. military was highlighted in the 2005 Department of Defense Quadrennial Defense Review. This strategic document emphasized some core departmental missions, including pursuing the Global War on Terrorism, enhancing homeland defense efforts and encouraging the spread of democratic institutions worldwide. The review highlighted many strategic priorities that are supported by General Dynamics products and services, including increasing special operations forces, improving intelligence-gathering capabilities, accelerating the production of littoral combat ships and increasing submarine procurement. Defense Funding 2001 2007 General Dynamics 2005 Annual Report 19 Table of Contents Internationally, many foreign governments remain committed to funding weapons and equipment modernization in the pursuit of interoperability with U.S. and allied forces and flexible capabilities for peacekeeping and regional operations. The company is committed to pursuing international opportunities presented by increased foreign demand for military hardware and information technologies. While revenue opportunities are significant, European and other foreign defense budgets are subject to the same unpredictable issues of contract award timing, defense priorities and overall fiscal spending pressures that exist in the United States. The company continues to focus on the needs of these customers and expects growing international sales, particularly in the Information Systems and Technology and Combat Systems businesses. In the business-aviation market, the Aerospace group is one of the world leading designers and manufacturers of business-jet aircraft and is a leader in the long-range and ultra-long-range, large-cabin business-jet market, as well as in the business-jet-service and product-support market. In 2005, the business-jet market continued to strengthen, reflecting an improved global economy and higher U.S. corporate earnings. To meet growing demand and maximize the company opportunities in the business-aviation market, the Aerospace group is increasing annual deliveries at a prudent production rate while focusing on margin improvement and a continual effort to bring new technology and products to market through ongoing R&D efforts. The company expects continued growth in the business-jet market, particularly as the company new mid-sized G150 model enters full-rate production in 2006. General Dynamics management is committed to creating shareholder value through ethical business practices, disciplined program management and continuous operational improvements. The company solid performance over the past 10 years is measured in its sustained revenue and earnings growth and strong cash flow. General Dynamics record as an industry leader in cash flow generation has enabled it to consistently deploy resources to enhance shareholder returns through strategic and tactical acquisitions, payment of dividends and share repurchases. CONSOLIDATED OVERVIEW Results of Operations General Dynamics net sales grew to $21.2 billion in 2005, up $2.1 billion, or 11 percent, over 2004. The company Information Systems and Technology group contributed over half of the sales increase in 2005, in large part from continued strong demand for the group tactical and strategic communications and computing products. The Combat Systems and Aerospace groups also experienced strong sales growth during the year, while sales in the Marine Systems group were consistent with 2004. Operating earnings increased 13 percent in 2005 to $2.2 billion compared with $1.9 billion in 2004. The growth in earnings resulted from the increased volume in Information Systems and Technology, Combat Systems, and Aerospace. In addition, the Aerospace group earnings increased at almost double the rate of sales in 2005 driven by a number of factors resulting from improved demand for the company business jets over the past two years. Increased earnings were offset in part by program losses in the Marine Systems group. Overall, the company operating margins increased to 10.3 percent in 2005 compared with 10.2 percent in 2004. Net sales increased 17 percent in 2004 over 2003, reaching $19.1 billion. This sales growth came from increased volume across all of the company primary business groups, and acquisitions in the Information Systems and Technology and Combat Systems groups. In 2004, operating earnings increased at twice the rate of sales growth. Earnings improved from $1.4 billion in 2003 to $1.9 billion in 2004, an increase of 35 percent. Improved performance in each of the company major business groups contributed to the growth in earnings. The Aerospace group produced substantially improved earnings on steady volume as a result of significant cost-cutting efforts and process improvements, while Marine Systems experienced fewer losses on its commercial shipbuilding programs compared with 2003. As a result, the company operating margins jumped from 8.8 percent in 2003 to 10.2 percent in 2004. 20 General Dynamics 2005 Annual Report Table of Contents The company cash flow from operating activities significantly exceeded net earnings in each of the past three years, continuing the company consistent record of generating substantial cash from operations. Net cash provided by operating activities was $2.1 billion in 2005 compared with $1.8 billion in 2004 and $1.7 billion in 2003. In addition, the company generated over $300 in cash from the sale of several non-core businesses in 2005. Over the three-year period, the company used its cash to fund acquisitions and capital expenditures, repurchase its common stock, pay dividends and reduce its outstanding debt. General and administrative (G&A) expenses as a percentage of sales were 6.2 percent in 2005 compared with 6.1 percent in 2004 and 6.6 percent in 2003. G&A was $1.3 billion in 2005, $1.2 billion in 2004 and $1.1 billion in 2003. The company expects 2006 G&A as a percent of sales to approximate the 2005 rate. In 2005, the company had income from non-operating items of $21 compared with net expense of $8 in 2004 and income of $3 in 2003. The income in 2005 consisted primarily of sales of assets. Net interest expense was $118 in 2005, a reduction of $30 from 2004. The decrease resulted from interest income generated by the company strong cash position during the year. Net interest increased to $148 in 2004 from $98 in 2003 because of a higher average borrowing balance from the company issuance of additional debt in 2003 to fund acquisitions. The company effective tax rate was 30.1 percent in 2005, 32.6 percent in 2004 and 27.3 percent in 2003. In 2005, the company favorably resolved its 1999 to 2002 audit with the Internal Revenue Service. This settlement resulted in a $66 non-cash benefit, which reduced the company 2005 tax rate by 3.1 percent. The 2003 tax rate benefited from the settlement of the 1996 to 1998 federal audit and the resolution of some outstanding state tax disputes. These events resulted in non-cash benefits in 2003 totaling $68, favorably impacting the company tax rate by 5 percent. The company anticipates an effective tax rate of approximately 34 percent in 2006 excluding the effect of potential settlements or other discrete events. For additional discussion of tax matters, see Note E to the Consolidated Financial Statements. In 2004, General Dynamics reviewed its businesses to identify operations that were not core to the company and could be divested. As a result, the company completed the sale of several small businesses in the second half of 2004 and the first quarter of 2005. The company reported net sales for all periods presented exclude the revenues associated with these businesses. Their earnings, however, are included as discontinued operations, net of income taxes, for all periods. The company received approximately $300 in cash, net of taxes, in 2005 from the sale of these businesses. For additional discussion of these divestiture activities, see Note C to the Consolidated Financial Statements. Backlog General Dynamics total backlog increased by $400 during 2005, reaching $42.4 billion at December 31. Funded backlog was $28.4 billion at year end. Significant order activity in each of the company business groups led to total new orders of $22.4 billion during the year despite a postponement of some order activity in the fourth quarter due to the delayed 2006 Department of Defense budget process. The total backlog for the company defense businesses was $34.1 billion at the end of 2005, compared with $34.9 billion at year-end 2004. The defense backlog represents the estimated remaining sales value of work to be performed under firm contracts. The funded portion of this backlog was $22.3 billion at December 31, 2005. This includes items that have been authorized and appropriated by the Congress and funded by the customer, as well as commitments by international customers that are similarly approved and funded by their governments. The unfunded backlog for the defense businesses represents firm orders for which funding has not been appropriated. While there is no guarantee that future budgets and appropriations will provide funding for a given program, the company has included in backlog only those programs that it believes are likely to receive funding. The backlog does not include work awarded under indefinite delivery, indefinite quantity (IDIQ) contracts. The total potential value of these contracts, which may be realized over the next 15 years, was approximately $6 billion as of December 31, 2005. The Aerospace group total backlog grew 18 percent in 2005, reaching a record level of $8.1 billion at December 31. The Aerospace funded backlog, an indicator of near-term demand, grew 26 percent to $5.9 billion at year end as a result of continued strong new aircraft orders in 2005. The funded backlog includes orders for which the company has definitive purchase contracts and deposits from the customer. The Aerospace unfunded backlog of $2.2 billion at December 31, 2005, consists of options to purchase new aircraft and agreements to provide future aircraft maintenance and support services. The Resources group contributed $230 to the company backlog at year-end 2005, including funded backlog of $165. General Dynamics 2005 Annual Report 21 Table of Contents REVIEW OF OPERATING SEGMENTS INFORMATION SYSTEMS AND TECHNOLOGY Results of Operations and Outlook Year Ended December 31 2005 2004 Variance Net sales $ 7,826 $ 6,722 $ 1,104 16 % Operating earnings 865 718 147 20 % Operating margin 11.1 % 10.7 % The Information Systems and Technology group sales and operating earnings increased substantially in 2005 compared with 2004. The group experienced a significant increase in activity in 2005 on its programs that provide secure communications and network systems to U.S. forces around the world. This demand is driven by both the Department of Defense and the U.S. intelligence community continuing effort to improve command-and-control and information-sharing capabilities, and the extensive deployment of U.S. forces in the Global War on Terrorism. These programs include: Intelligence Information, Command-and-Control Equipment and Enhancements (ICE2), which supports critical intelligence and command-and-control systems and networks for U.S. defense and intelligence operations worldwide; Common Hardware/Software III (CHS-3), which provides continually updated commercial and ruggedized computers, network equipment and software to the U.S. armed forces and other federal agencies worldwide; Mobile User Objective System (MUOS), which enables on-the-move satellite connectivity for U.S. and allied forces; and Cluster 5 of the Joint Tactical Radio System (JTRS), under which the group is developing small, lightweight software-defined radios for use by all branches of the U.S. military. Information Systems and Technology support of international customers command-and-control and communications needs also contributed to the significant sales volume in 2005. These programs include most notably the BOWMAN and Combat, Infrastructure and Platform (CIP) programs for the United Kingdom and the Canadian Maritime Helicopter Project (MHP). BOWMAN is a secure digital voice and data communications system for the U.K. armed forces. The related CIP program is the new digital command-and-control system for U.K. ground and joint forces. Under the MHP contract, the company is providing integrated mission systems for 28 state-of-the-art helicopters that are intended to replace Canada aging fleet of marine helicopters. Acquisitions in 2004 and 2005 contributed about 40 percent of the group 2005 sales growth. During 2005, the company completed three acquisitions to strengthen its market position MAYA Viz Ltd., in April; Tadpole Computer, Inc., in August; and Itronix Corporation in September. The company acquired Spectrum Astro, Inc., and TriPoint Global Communications Inc. in the second half of 2004. The operating results of these businesses have been included as of the respective dates of the acquisitions. The increase in sales excluding the effect of acquisitions was 10 percent. Operating margins in 2005 improved over 2004 due to the timing and mix of contract performance phases and customer deliveries, and the continued integration of acquired businesses. The company expects single-digit sales growth in the Information Systems and Technology group in 2006 with operating margins similar to the average margins achieved in 2005, though margins may fluctuate from period to period. Year Ended December 31 2004 2003 Variance Net sales $ 6,722 $ 4,848 $ 1,874 39 % Operating earnings 718 533 185 35 % Operating margin 10.7 % 11.0 % The solid growth in Information Systems and Technology in 2005 followed a significant increase in sales in 2004. The group experienced considerable growth in sales and operating earnings in 2004 due to increased volume across all areas of its business mix, including: communications products, such as the BOWMAN program for the U.K. armed forces and the Warfighter Information Network-Tactical (WIN-T) program for the U.S. Army; global mission solutions, such as the ICE2 contract for the U.S. Air Force; surveillance and reconnaissance systems; and network infrastructure and wireless systems. Acquisitions in 2003 and 2004 contributed about half of the sales growth in 2004. The group operating margins decreased in 2004 compared with 2003 from a shift in program mix and the impact of lower-margin businesses acquired in 2003. Backlog 22 General Dynamics 2005 Annual Report Table of Contents The Information Systems and Technology group finished 2005 with a total backlog of $9.4 billion, up slightly from $9.3 billion at the end of 2004. The group maintained this substantial level of backlog despite record sales volume in 2005 due to a significant amount of order activity during the year. The group funded backlog was $7 billion at December 31, 2005, approximately 75 percent of the total backlog. Unlike the company other defense businesses, the Information Systems and Technology group backlog is comprised primarily of a large number of mid-size contracts and programs as well as several large-scale, long-term programs awarded over the past few years. Several significant awards contributed to the backlog in 2005. The group received an order from the Army to integrate up to 500 Land Warrior soldier ensembles into a Stryker experimental battalion. Land Warrior uses advanced combat technology to enhance individual soldiers tactical awareness, lethality and survivability. This award is part of a contract valued at approximately $260. In 2005, the Army merged the Land Warrior and Future Force Warrior programs into one contract managed by General Dynamics to expedite the fielding of this integrated system. The group backlog at December 31, 2005, included approximately $350 for the Army Future Combat Systems (FCS) program. The Army realigned the FCS program in 2005 to expedite delivery of newly developed technologies to existing forces. In addition, the company was awarded modifications to several of its contracts under the FCS program. The group received $210 in orders in 2005, including a modification worth $154 to accelerate technology development of the program integrated computer system by two years. Combat Systems also performs work on the FCS program. Information Systems and Technology received a contract worth $170 to design, manufacture and deliver 25 12-meter antennas for an advanced radio telescope array at an international astronomy facility. The antennas are a critical element of a project intended to provide the world most sensitive, highest resolution telescope to enable scientists to observe and image galaxies, stars and planets with unprecedented clarity. The Navy awarded the group a contract with a potential value of approximately $150 through 2009 to provide fire control system production, operational support, field engineering services, training and development for the Navy Trident ballistic missile submarines. The group was awarded a contract worth over $100 to support the development of New York Statewide Wireless Network. The network is intended to improve communications and enhance coordination for state and local public safety and public service organizations responding to emergency situations across New York. Information Systems and Technology was selected to provide all site integration activities, including program and construction management and site development for all radio-access site infrastructure. The Navy awarded the group a contract to provide system integration and design agent services for the Open Architecture Track Manager. The track manager is an improved component within naval combat systems that receives and translates information to create an integrated picture of the locations and paths of aircraft, ships and submarines in the battle space. The contract has a potential value of approximately $100. In 2005, the group experienced significant demand from international customers for its communications and IT products and services. The group is a member of the team that was selected in 2005 by the U.K. Ministry of Defence for the first increment of the Defence Information Infrastructure (Future) program. The program calls for consolidation of numerous existing information networks into a single infrastructure and is a key component of the United Kingdom future military strategy. The company subcontract is worth approximately $220, with options valued at an additional $300. The group received a contract from the Royal Netherlands Navy worth approximately $115 to supply the New Integrated Marines Communications and Information Systems (NIMCIS). NIMCIS is a two-year program to equip the Royal Netherlands Marine Corps with a BOWMAN-like communications system. The group leads a team selected by the Commonwealth of Australia to serve as the preferred prime system integrator for the first phase of the Battlespace Communications System (Land) program (JP 2072). JP 2072 is intended to provide the Australian Land Force with a deployable, scalable, secure and integrated battlespace communications system that allows ground forces to exchange information across all combat elements, improving soldiers safety and their ability to accomplish their missions. The group contract has an initial value of approximately $75, and the total program has a potential value of approximately $600 if all options are exercised. The group backlog does not include approximately $4.8 billion of potential contract value awarded under IDIQ contracts. IDIQ contracts are used when a customer has not defined the exact timing and quantity of deliveries that will be required at the time the contract is executed. These agreements set forth the majority of the contractual terms, including prices, but are funded as delivery orders are placed. A significant portion of this IDIQ value represents contracts for which the company has been designated as the sole-source supplier over several years to design, develop, produce and integrate complex products and systems for the military or other government agencies. Management believes that the customers intend to fully implement these systems. However, because the value of these arrangements is subject to the customer future exercise of an indeterminate quantity of delivery orders, the company recognizes these contracts in backlog only when they are funded. In 2005, funding from customers under these IDIQ contracts contributed approximately $1.8 billion to the group backlog. Information Systems and Technology was awarded several significant IDIQ contracts during 2005, including a modification providing approximately $150 in funding for its Rescue 21 search-and-rescue communications system for the U.S. Coast Guard. The award brings the funded contract value to over $300. This IDIQ contract has a potential value of approximately $750 if all options are exercised. The Army awarded the group the Total Engineering and Integration Services (TEIS) contract, an IDIQ multiple-award contract to provide information technology engineering and technical support at customer sites worldwide. The TEIS contract has a performance period of one base year and four option years with a ceiling value of approximately $800. General Dynamics 2005 Annual Report 23 Table of Contents COMBAT SYSTEMS Results of Operations and Outlook Year Ended December 31 2005 2004 Variance Net sales $ 5,021 $ 4,407 $ 614 14 % Operating earnings 576 522 54 10 % Operating margin 11.5 % 11.8 % The Combat Systems group produced strong growth in net sales and operating earnings in 2005 compared with 2004. The largest contributor to the increase was the Stryker wheeled combat vehicle program. Volume on this program increased significantly in 2005 as the group continued production of the fourth and fifth brigades and began work on the Mobile Gun System. Demand for add-on armor spurred additional program activity. Other notable volume increases include the M1A2 Abrams tank System Enhancement Package (SEP) program, the Canadian RG-31 mine-protected personnel vehicle contract and the Saudi Arabian National Guard light armored vehicle contract. In the armaments and munitions businesses, demand increased in 2005 for reactive armor, counter-improvised explosive device (IED) systems, and large-, medium- and small-caliber ammunition. These increases were offset in part by the completion of several international combat vehicle programs in 2004, including the Ulan tracked armored vehicle program and the Australian and New Zealand light armored vehicle programs. Sales were also down in the group European business as a result of delays in the timing of customer requirements. Additionally, Combat Systems experienced a temporary decline in volume in 2005 on the Hydra-70 rocket production program, as the group transitioned to a new contract awarded during the year. Operating margins were down slightly in 2005 compared with 2004 because of a shift in product mix and the timing of deliveries in the group European business. The company expects Combat Systems to produce double-digit sales growth overall in 2006, with particularly strong growth in the group European business as the work that was deferred in 2005 is realized. Operating margins in 2006 should be consistent with the full-year 2005 margins. Year Ended December 31 2004 2003 Variance Net sales $ 4,407 $ 4,007 $ 400 10 % Operating earnings 522 443 79 18 % Operating margin 11.8 % 11.1 % The Combat Systems group net sales and operating earnings increased in 2004 compared with 2003 from increased demand for the group products in the United States and internationally. Several armored vehicle programs in the group European business contributed to the sales and earnings growth, including Leopard tanks, Ulan tracked infantry vehicles and Piranha wheeled combat vehicles. Activity also increased on the group contract to develop manned ground vehicles for the Army FCS program and in its munitions and armaments businesses. This growth was reduced by a lower volume of M1 Abrams tank upgrades and reduced deliveries on the Stryker program due to the timing of customer requirements. Operating earnings increased at almost double the rate of sales growth in 2004 because of improved performance on several of the group programs and a shift in contract mix. Backlog The Combat Systems group backlog increased 7 percent in 2005, reaching $9.3 billion at December 31. Funded backlog increased 9 percent over 2004 to $7 billion at year end. The group backlog consists primarily of long-term production contracts with scheduled deliveries through 2013. The group backlog at December 31, 2005, included approximately $1.9 billion for the Army FCS program. In 2005, Combat Systems was awarded a $282 modification to its contract for the engineering development and demonstration of a family of manned ground vehicles. The modification extends the contract through 2012. The group also received a modification valued at approximately $50 under its contract to develop the autonomous navigation system for FCS ground vehicles. Information Systems and Technology is performing additional work on the FCS program. The Combat Systems group backlog at year end also included approximately $1.2 billion for the production of Stryker wheeled combat vehicles. In 2005, the group received orders from the Army valued at approximately $1.5 billion under the Stryker program. These awards included the production of 423 vehicles to equip the fifth Stryker brigade, add-on armor sets and engineering services. Also included in the awards was an order for 99 Stryker vehicles to meet additional Army requirements and a contract for the refurbishment of 265 Stryker infantry combat vehicles returning from duty in Iraq. Under this contract, the company will service, repair and modify the Stryker vehicles, restoring them to pre-combat, like-new condition before their next deployment. 24 General Dynamics 2005 Annual Report Table of Contents In 2005, the Army also awarded the Combat Systems group two contracts worth approximately $300 to upgrade 124 M1A2 Abrams tanks to the M1A2 SEP configuration. Through this program, the company retrofits M1A2 tanks with improved electronics, command-and-control capabilities and armor enhancements that are designed to improve the tank effectiveness. Combat Systems received a contract valued at approximately $130 for the production of Towed Artillery Digitization (TAD) Digital Fire Control Systems (DFCS) for the M777 howitzer. This system provides sensors, displays, mission computers, power supplies and communication systems that support the M777 155mm howitzer used by the Army and Marines Corps. In addition, in February 2006, the group received an order worth approximately $130 from the Marine Corps to provide eight-wheeled light armored vehicles (LAV) in various configurations. The contract has a total potential value of over $300 for a total of 130 vehicles to be delivered in 2007 and 2008. Internationally, in 2005 the group finalized a contract with the Government of Portugal to produce 260 Pandur II armored combat vehicles. The contract is valued at approximately $480, and deliveries are scheduled to begin in 2007 and continue through 2009. The Combat Systems group has several international, long-term combat vehicle production contracts in backlog as of December 31, 2005. The group Leopard program is a long-term battle tank manufacturing contract for the Spanish army under license from a German company. The group backlog at the end of 2005 included over $700 for the production of 181 Leopard tanks, with deliveries scheduled through 2009. The group also produces Pizarro Advanced Infantry Fighting Vehicles for the Spanish army. The year-end backlog included $665 for the production of 212 Pizarro vehicles scheduled for delivery through 2012. In January 2006, Combat Systems received several orders for its combat vehicles from European customers, further demonstrating the appeal of these vehicles in the international market. The group was selected by the Czech Republic to produce 199 eight-wheeled Pandur II armored personnel carriers between 2007 and 2012 for the Czech army. The contract, which is expected to be finalized and added to backlog in the first half of 2006, has an option for 35 additional vehicles and is worth up to $1 billion. The Belgian government selected the group Piranha light armored vehicle for its Armored Infantry Vehicle program. The program calls for up to 242 vehicles and related logistics support and is worth approximately $600 if all options are exercised. The group also received an order from the Irish Department of Defence valued at approximately $40 for 15 Piranha vehicles. The Combat Systems group backlog at year end also included approximately $1.4 billion in armament, munitions and composite-structures programs. In 2005, the group received funding of approximately $150 for the production of Hydra-70 (70mm) rockets, motors and warheads. These orders are part of a five-year requirements contract with an estimated value of $900. The group was also awarded an initial order of $170 under a five-year contract to supply 300-500 million rounds per year of small-caliber ammunition to the U.S. armed forces. The contract has a total potential value of approximately $1.2 billion if all options are exercised. Additionally, the group received contract modifications worth approximately $90 for the production of enhanced-capability reactive armor tile sets for Army Bradley Fighting Vehicles. In February 2006, the group received an IDIQ contract from the Marine Corps with a potential value of approximately $290 to develop, design, integrate, produce and install IED Electronic Countermeasure systems. MARINE SYSTEMS Results of Operations and Outlook Year Ended December 31 2005 2004 Variance Net sales $ 4,695 $ 4,726 $ (31 ) (1 )% Operating earnings 249 292 (43 ) (15 )% Operating margin 5.3 % 6.2 % The Marine Systems group net sales remained steady in 2005 compared with 2004. Activity on the Virginia-class submarine and T-AKE combat logistics ship construction programs increased significantly in 2005. Construction is in progress on the second through seventh ships of the Virginia class and the first three of nine T-AKE ships under contract. The volume increase in these programs was offset by the completion of the Seawolf-class submarine program in 2004, decreased activity on the group commercial tanker contract, and fewer repair and engineering contracts. Program losses in 2004 and 2005 adversely affected operating earnings and margins in Marine Systems. The company continued to experience losses on its contract to build four double-hull oil tankers. In 2003 and 2004, the company recorded losses on this contract related to performance problems, schedule delays and subcontractor difficulties. In 2005, additional schedule delays and labor hour growth resulted in a loss of $50 on the program. The second and third ships were delivered in 2005, and the final ship is scheduled for delivery in the third quarter of 2006. Management does not expect any additional charges on the commercial tanker program, though risk will remain until the final ship is delivered. The group also recorded losses totaling approximately $20 in the first half of 2005 on two submarine maintenance and overhaul contracts. These losses resulted from customer-requested change orders that the group fulfilled prior to securing adequate contractual protection. The company is in negotiations with the customer to recover some of the incurred costs and does not expect to have this type of exposure on future submarine overhaul contracts. The group has also experienced cost growth on the Navy T-AKE program primarily from engineering- and design-related changes imposed by the customer. The company has submitted a formal request for equitable adjustment with the customer seeking more than $500 of additional contract payments for the rework effort and scope growth caused General Dynamics 2005 Annual Report 25 Table of Contents by these changes. The company is recording revenue at a break-even level based on the assumed recovery of a portion of this claim (see Note F to the Consolidated Financial Statements). The company is in discussions with the Navy to quantify its contractual relief for the unanticipated costs and expects the resolution of this matter to take several quarters. As of December 31, 2005, the first T-AKE was 91 percent complete, the second ship was 51 percent complete, and construction had begun on the third ship. The first ship is scheduled to be delivered in the second quarter of 2006. The company expects the Marine Systems group sales in 2006 to be similar to the 2005 volume with improving margins, assuming no further program losses. Year Ended December 31 2004 2003 Variance Net sales $ 4,726 $ 4,271 $ 455 11 % Operating earnings 292 216 76 35 % Operating margin 6.2 % 5.1 % In 2004, the group net sales increased compared with 2003 from higher volume on the Virginia-class and T-AKE programs and the conversion of Trident ballistic-missile submarines to a conventional-strike configuration (SSGN). Engineering and repair contract activity was also up in 2004. Lower volume on commercial shipbuilding contracts and mature defense production programs partially offset the growth in these programs. Operating earnings and margins improved significantly because of improved results on the group commercial shipbuilding programs in 2004 relative to 2003. Backlog The Marine Systems group backlog consists of long-term submarine and ship construction programs, as well as repair and engineering contracts. The group total backlog as of December 31, 2005, was $15.4 billion, including $8.4 billion of funded backlog. The 2005 backlog was down 8 percent from the previous year as the group continued its progress on the significant volume of awards received in 2003. The current backlog provides for shipbuilding programs through 2014. The Virginia-class submarine program is the group largest contract in backlog. The lead ship in the class was delivered in 2004, and the company backlog included $8.3 billion at December 31, 2005, for the construction of the nine additional submarines under contract. The current Navy plan calls for one submarine to be delivered per year through 2011 and two per year starting in 2012. The company is the prime contractor on this program, and construction is shared equally with its teaming partner. In 2005, the Navy awarded Marine Systems a contract worth over $100 to provide lead-yard services and research-and-development studies for Virginia-class submarines in support of the related construction contract. In January 2006, the Navy awarded the group a contract modification worth $1.3 billion that provides funding for the construction of the eighth Virginia-class submarine and advance procurement for the ninth and tenth ships. The group backlog at year-end 2005 included $2.5 billion for nine Arleigh Burke-class DDG destroyers scheduled for delivery through 2010. In 2005, the Navy awarded the company approximately $560 in funding to construct the final destroyer under contract in the DDG program. The Navy exercised two options in 2005 worth approximately $590 for the seventh and eighth ships in the T-AKE program, bringing the total contract value to $2.5 billion. The group backlog at the end of 2005 included $1.7 billion for the construction of the first eight T-AKE ships. Deliveries of these ships are scheduled through 2008. In January 2006, the Navy exercised an option worth approximately $320 for the ninth T-AKE ship, bringing the total contract value to $2.8 billion. In 2005, the Navy modified the Marine Systems group SSGN contract, adding approximately $320. Under this contract, the company is converting four Trident ballistic-missile submarines to an SSGN configuration, a multi-mission submarine optimized for tactical strike and special operations support. The 2005 awards cover the conversion of the third and fourth ships, the USS Michigan and the USS Georgia , and bring the total value of the contract to $1.3 billion. The conversion of the USS Ohio was completed in 2005. Marine Systems leads one of two teams selected for the development and construction of the Littoral Combat Ship (LCS), the Navy newest class of high-speed surface combatants. LCS ships are designed to operate in coastal areas against terrorist threats, high-speed swarm boats, mines and diesel submarines. In 2005, the Navy exercised an option worth $223 for the detailed design and construction of the LCS. The company first LCS is expected to be delivered in 2007. The group also received a seven-year contract from the Navy in 2005 worth approximately $200 for the maintenance and repair of four LSD-class and four LPD-class ships. These amphibious ships transport Marines and their combat equipment to areas throughout the world, and launch and support landing craft and helicopters during amphibious assault and other military operations. 26 General Dynamics 2005 Annual Report Table of Contents AEROSPACE Results of Operations and Outlook Year Ended December 31 2005 2004 Variance Net sales $ 3,433 $ 3,012 $ 421 14 % Operating earnings 495 393 102 26 % Operating margin 14.4 % 13.0 % Aircraft Deliveries (in units): Green 89 78 Completion 84 77 The Aerospace group net sales increased in 2005 compared with 2004 on a significant jump in new aircraft volume and higher aircraft services activity. The company delivered 11 more green units and seven more completions in 2005 than in 2004, reflecting a strong increase in demand over the past two years. Pre-owned sales declined as the group customers increasingly opt to sell their pre-owned aircraft in the market rather than trading them in with the company. The group 2005 operating earnings increased significantly over 2004. A number of factors contributed to this strong earnings growth. Earnings in new aircraft manufacturing improved due to a combination of increased deliveries, a more favorable mix of units delivered and improving pricing. Aircraft services earnings increased from the higher volume and improved cost performance. Pre-owned aircraft earnings were up substantially on three fewer deliveries as market conditions continue to improve. New aircraft orders in 2005 exceeded 2004 record level, and new aircraft pricing continued to improve during the year. Gulfstream has raised its planned production for 2006 by more than 25 percent over 2005, and the 2006 production schedule is substantially sold out. The company expects significant sales growth in the Aerospace group in 2006 with margins that approximate those achieved in 2005. The company expects a shift in mix in the group starting in 2006 due to increased production of lower-margin, mid-size aircraft with the introduction of the new G150. Year Ended December 31 2004 2003 Variance Net sales $ 3,012 $ 2,946 $ 66 2 % Operating earnings 393 218 175 80 % Operating margin 13.0 % 7.4 % Aircraft Deliveries (in units): Green 78 74 Completion 77 74 Net sales in the Aerospace group grew slightly in 2004 over 2003. Increased new aircraft sales and higher aircraft services activity were offset by lower pre-owned aircraft sales. Operating earnings and margins increased substantially in 2004 because of significant cost reductions, higher earnings on pre-owned aircraft sales and a more favorable mix of aircraft deliveries. Summary of Aircraft Statistical Information Sales contracts for new aircraft usually have two major milestones: the manufacture of the green aircraft and the aircraft completion, which includes exterior painting and installation of customer-selected interiors and optional avionics. The company records revenues when green aircraft are delivered to and accepted by the customer, and when the customer accepts final delivery of the fully outfitted aircraft. The following table summarizes key unit data for the Aerospace group orders and backlog: Year Ended December 31 2005 2004 2003 New orders 124 96 75 Options exercised 1 3 Firm orders 124 97 78 Cancellations (a) (3 ) (2 ) (12 ) Total orders 121 95 66 New options 3 Firm contracts in backlog 207 175 158 Options in backlog 100 100 103 Total aircraft in backlog 307 275 261 Completions in backlog (b) 42 39 38 (a) Excludes fractional activity, because orders are made under master agreements that the customer draws down over several years.

Backlog includes only the value of the completion effort on these aircraft. New Aircraft Book-to-Bill Ratio 2003-2005* * Represents ratio of new aircraft orders to deliveries (in units) during the year. Deliveries include 12 units in 2005, 10 units in 2004 and two units in 2003 to fractional fleet customers. General Dynamics 2005 Annual Report 27 Table of Contents Backlog The Aerospace group backlog exceeded $8 billion at the end of 2005, an increase of 18 percent over 2004. The group funded backlog grew 26 percent in 2005 to $5.9 billion at year end, representing almost 75 percent of the total backlog. The group received 124 orders in 2005, 28 percent more than the record number of orders received in 2004, excluding fractional activity. In the fourth quarter of 2005, the Aerospace group achieved a book-to-bill ratio (net orders divided by sales) greater than one for the sixth consecutive quarter. The group backlog includes aircraft deliveries through 2011. A significant portion of the group backlog is with NetJets Inc. (NetJets), a unit of Berkshire Hathaway and the leader in the fractional aircraft market. NetJets purchases the aircraft for use in its fractional ownership program. The group funded backlog at year end included $1.6 billion with NetJets, representing firm contracts for 91 aircraft, including 15 green aircraft that are scheduled for delivery in 2006. The unfunded backlog included $1.4 billion for 100 aircraft options from NetJets, constituting all of the options in backlog. NetJets also represented 69 percent of the maintenance and support services in unfunded backlog. Deliveries of aircraft to NetJets are scheduled from 2006 through 2011 and represent as little as 4 percent and as much as 11 percent of projected new aircraft sales in those years. The group remaining $4.3 billion of funded backlog at year-end 2005 consisted of contracts with a broad range of customers from a variety of industries and included approximately $470 of contracts with government customers. Scheduled Deliveries of Aerospace Funded Backlog RESOURCES The company Resources group consists of two businesses: a coal mining company and an aggregates company that supplies the construction industry. Results of Operations Year Ended December 31 2005 2004 Variance Net sales $ 269 $ 252 $ 17 7 % Operating earnings 12 19 (7 ) (37 )% The Resources group net sales increased in 2005 compared with 2004 due to higher volume in the aggregates business. Operating earnings decreased in 2005 as a result of adjustments to certain contingent liabilities based on newly available information. On March 1, 2006, the company entered into a definitive agreement to sell its aggregates business. The company expects the transaction to close in the first half of 2006. Year Ended December 31 2004 2003 Variance Net sales $ 252 $ 256 $ (4 ) (2 )% Operating earnings 19 32 (13 ) (41 )% The group net sales in 2004 decreased slightly compared with 2003 as lower volume in the coal business was largely offset by increased activity in the aggregates business. The group 2004 operating earnings were lower than 2003 because the earnings in 2003 were favorably impacted by the reduction of surface reclamation obligations in the company coal mining operations. 28 General Dynamics 2005 Annual Report Table of Contents FINANCIAL CONDITION, LIQUIDITY AND CAPITAL RESOURCES In the mid-1990s, General Dynamics embarked on a strategy of disciplined capital deployment, generating strong cash flow to enable a series of acquisitions designed to grow the company beyond its core platform businesses. These acquisitions incorporated new products and technologies and expanded the company customer base. Since 1995, the company has acquired 40 businesses at a total cost of almost $14 billion. This has resulted in a larger, more diversified company while preserving a strong balance sheet and sustained financial flexibility. General Dynamics management continues to emphasize the efficient conversion of net earnings into cash. In 2005, net cash provided by operating activities greatly exceeded net earnings for the third consecutive year. The company employed this cash to complete three niche acquisitions, continue its trend of annual dividend increases and repurchase its outstanding shares. The company ended 2005 with a cash balance of $2.3 billion, total debt of $3.3 billion and a debt-to-capital ratio of 28.8 percent. Free cash flow from operations was $1.8 billion in 2005 compared with $1.5 billion in both 2004 and 2003. Management defines free cash flow from operations as net cash provided by operating activities less capital expenditures. Management believes free cash flow from operations is a useful measure for investors, because it portrays the company ability to generate cash from its core businesses for purposes such as repaying maturing debt, funding business acquisitions, repurchasing its common stock and paying dividends. The following table reconciles the free cash flow from operations with net cash provided by operating activities, as classified on the Consolidated Statement of Cash Flows: Year Ended December 31 2005 2004 2003 Net cash provided by operating activities $ 2,056 $ 1,800 $ 1,721 Capital expenditures (279 ) (264 ) (220 ) Free cash flow from operations $ 1,777 $ 1,536 $ 1,501 Cash flows as a percentage of net earnings: Net cash provided by operating activities 141 % 147 % 171 % Free cash flow from operations 122 % 125 % 150 % Over the past 10 years, the company has generated free cash flow from operations well in excess of its net earnings during the period. With free cash flow from operations projected to approximate net earnings in 2006, the company expects to continue to generate funds in excess of its short- and long-term liquidity needs. Management believes that the company has adequate funds on hand and sufficient borrowing capacity to execute its financial and operating strategy. The following is a discussion of the company major operating, investing and financing activities for each of the three years in the period ended December 31, 2005, as classified on the Consolidated Statement of Cash Flows. Operating Activities Net cash provided by operating activities was $2.1 billion in 2005, $1.8 billion in 2004 and $1.7 billion in 2003. In each year, net earnings was the primary driver of the company cash flow. In 2005, the additional cash flow was due to a high level of customer deposits associated with the order activity in the Aerospace group and a significant inflow of customer advances in the fourth quarter in the company European business. In 2004, cash from operating activities exceeded net earnings due primarily to the timing of tax payments. In 2003, the increase in cash flow was attributable to substantial reductions in both new and pre-owned aircraft inventory in the Aerospace group and an influx of customer advances near the end of the year. Termination of A-12 Program. As discussed further in Note O to the Consolidated Financial Statements, litigation on the A-12 program termination has been ongoing since 1991. If, contrary to the company expectations, the default termination ultimately is sustained, the company and The Boeing Company could collectively be required to repay the U.S. government as much as $1.4 billion for progress payments received for the A-12 contract, plus interest, which was approximately $1.2 billion at December 31, 2005. If this were the outcome, the government contends the company would owe approximately $1.3 billion. The company after-tax cash obligation would be approximately $640. The company believes that it has sufficient resources to pay such an obligation, if required, while still retaining ample liquidity. Investing Activities Cash used in investing activities was $181 in 2005, $781 in 2004 and $3.2 billion in 2003. The primary uses of cash in investing activities were business acquisitions and capital expenditures. In 2005, these uses of cash were partially offset by proceeds from divestiture activities. Business Acquisitions. In 2005, the company completed three acquisitions for a total of approximately $275. On April 1, the company acquired MAYA Viz Ltd., of Pittsburgh, Pennsylvania. On August 16, the company acquired Tadpole Computer, Inc., of Cupertino, California. On September 2, the company acquired Itronix Corporation of Spokane, Washington. In 2004, the company completed three acquisitions at a total cost of approximately $500. On July 9, the company acquired Spectrum Astro, Inc., of Gilbert, Arizona. On September 17, the company acquired TriPoint Global Communications Inc., based in Newton, North Carolina. On November 1, the company acquired Engineering Technology Inc., of Orlando, Florida. On August 11, 2003, the company completed its acquisition of Veridian Corporation, headquartered in Arlington, Virginia, for approximately $1.5 billion in cash. On March 1, 2003, the company acquired GM Defense of London, Ontario, a business unit of General Motors Corporation, for approximately $1.1 billion in cash. The company completed several other business acquisitions in the Information Systems and Technology, Combat Systems and Aerospace groups during 2003 at a total cost of approximately $470. The company financed these acquisitions by issuing commercial paper. The company refinanced a substantial portion of its commercial paper during 2003, as discussed in Financing Activities. General Dynamics 2005 Annual Report 29 Table of Contents In the fourth quarter of 2005, General Dynamics entered into a definitive agreement to acquire Anteon International Corporation for approximately $2.2 billion, including the assumption of debt. The company intends to finance the acquisition with cash on hand and commercial paper and expects the transaction to close in the first half of 2006. Capital Expenditures. Capital expenditures were $279 in 2005, $264 in 2004 and $220 in 2003. The company expects capital expenditures of approximately $425 in 2006. The anticipated increase over 2005 relates to planned facility improvements at Gulfstream and certain projects that were delayed in 2005. The company had no material commitments for capital expenditures as of December 31, 2005. Sale of Assets. In 2005, the company completed the sales of several small, non-core businesses. The company received approximately $300 in cash, net of tax payments, from these divestiture activities. In 2004, the company sold two small, non-core businesses. The company sold its remaining real estate holdings in southern California in 2004. During 2003 and 2004, the company received a total of $40 in cash in connection with these land sales. Financing Activities Cash used by financing activities was $520 in 2005 and $904 in 2004 compared with $2 billion of cash generated in 2003. The company typical financing activities are issuances and repayments of debt, payment of dividends and repurchases of common stock. Debt Proceeds, Net. There were no material debt repayments in 2005. In 2004, the company repaid $500 of floating-rate notes that matured in September. In 2003, the company issued $3.1 billion of medium-term fixed-rate debt securities under a Form S-3 Registration Statement filed with the Securities and Exchange Commission. The proceeds of this debt were used to repay a substantial portion of the company commercial paper in 2003, which had the effect of fixing interest rates on debt that previously carried variable rates. Net repayments of commercial paper were $182 in 2004 and $529 in 2003. As of December 31, 2004 and 2005, the company had no commercial paper outstanding. The company has $2 billion in bank credit facilities that have not been drawn upon and are used to provide backup liquidity to the commercial paper program. In the second quarter of 2006, $500 of the company fixed-rate debt securities is scheduled to mature. Dividends. On March 1, 2006, the company board of directors declared an increased regular quarterly dividend of $0. 46 per share the ninth consecutive annual increase. The board had previously increased the quarterly dividend to $0.40 per share in March 2005, to $0.36 per share in March 2004 and to $0.32 per share in March 2003. Share Repurchases. During 2005, the company repurchased 3.3 million shares of its outstanding common stock in the open market at an average price of $107 per share. The company did not repurchase any shares during 2004. In 2003, the company repurchased 4.7 million shares at an average price of $64 per share. As of December 31, 2005, the company had approximately 1.2 million remaining shares authorized for repurchase. ADDITIONAL FINANCIAL INFORMATION Off-Balance Sheet Arrangements As of December 31, 2005, other than operating leases, the company had no material off-balance sheet arrangements, such as guarantees; retained or contingent interests in assets transferred to unconsolidated entities; derivative instruments indexed to the company stock and classified in shareholders equity on the Consolidated Balance Sheet; and variable interests in entities that provide financing, liquidity, market risk or credit risk support to the company or engage in leasing, hedging or research and development services with the company. Contractual Obligations The following table presents information about the company contractual obligations as of December 31, 2005: Payment Due by Period Contractual Obligations Total Amount Committed Less Than 1 Year 1-3 Years 3-5 Years More Than 5 Years Long-term debt (a) $ 4,038 $ 636 $ 914 $ 881 $ 1,607 Capital lease obligations 8 2 4 2 Operating leases 808 143 229 152 284 Purchase obligations (b) 16,078 7,546 4,786 2,147 1,599 Other long-term liabilities (c) 3,617 1,180 850 378 1,209 $ 24,549 $ 9,507 $ 6,783 $ 3,560 $ 4,699 (a) Includes scheduled interest payments. (b) Includes amounts committed under legally enforceable agreements for goods and services with defined terms as to quantity, price and timing of delivery. This amount includes $11.5 billion of purchase orders for products and services to be delivered under firm government contracts under which the company has full recourse under normal contract termination clauses. As disclosed in Note Q to the Consolidated Financial Statements, the company expects to make approximately $40 of contributions to its retirement plans in 2006. This amount has been excluded from the above amount. (c) Represents other long-term liabilities on the company Consolidated Balance Sheet, including the current portion of long-term liabilities. The projected timing of cash flows associated with these obligations is based on management estimates, which are largely based on historical experience. 30 General Dynamics 2005 Annual Report Table of Contents Commercial Commitments The following table presents information about the company commercial commitments as of December 31, 2005: Amount of Commitment Expiration by Period Commercial Commitments Total Amount Committed Less Than 1 Year 1-3 Years 3-5 Years More Than 5 Years Letters of credit* $ 1,615 $ 991 $ 235 $ 10 $ 379 Trade-in options* 570 210 360 $ 2,185 $ 1,201 $ 595 $ 10 $ 379 * See Note O to the Consolidated Financial Statements for discussion of letters of credit and aircraft trade-in options. Application of Critical Accounting Policies Management Discussion and Analysis of the company Financial Condition and Results of Operations is based on the company Consolidated Financial Statements, which have been prepared in accordance with U.S. generally accepted accounting principles (GAAP). The preparation of financial statements in accordance with GAAP requires management to make estimates and assumptions that affect the reported amounts of assets and liabilities and the disclosure of contingent assets and liabilities at the date of the financial statements, as well as the reported amounts of revenues and expenses during the reporting period. On an ongoing basis, management evaluates its estimates, including those related to long-term contracts and programs, goodwill and other intangible assets, income taxes, pensions and other post-retirement benefits, workers compensation, warranty obligations, pre-owned aircraft inventory, and contingencies and litigation. Management bases its estimates on historical experience and on various other assumptions that it believes to be reasonable under the circumstances. The results of these estimates form the basis for making judgments about the carrying values of assets and liabilities that are not readily available from other sources. Actual results may differ from these estimates under different assumptions or conditions. Management believes the following policies are critical and require the use of significant business judgment in their application: Revenue Recognition Government Contracts. The company accounts for sales and earnings under long-term government contracts and programs using the percentage-of-completion method of accounting. The company follows the guidelines of American Institute of Certified Public Accountants (AICPA) Statement of Position 81-1, Accounting for Performance of Construction-Type and Certain Production-Type Contracts , except that revisions of estimated profits on contracts are included in earnings under the reallocation method, in accordance with Accounting Principles Board Opinion No. 20, Accounting Changes , rather than the cumulative catch-up method. Under the reallocation method, the impact of revisions in estimates is recognized prospectively over the remaining contract term, while under the cumulative catch-up method such impact would be recognized immediately. If a revised estimate of contract profitability reveals an anticipated loss on the contract, the company recognizes the loss in the period it is identified. Anticipated losses cover all costs allocable to the contracts, including G&A expenses. The company estimates profit as the difference between total estimated revenue and total estimated cost of a contract and recognizes that profit over the remaining life of the contract based on either input (e.g., costs incurred) or output (e.g., units delivered) measures, as appropriate to the circumstances. The percentage-of-completion method of accounting involves the use of various estimating techniques to project costs at completion, and in some cases includes estimates of recoveries asserted against the customer for changes in specifications. These estimates involve various assumptions and projections relative to the outcome of future events over a period of several years, including future labor productivity and availability, the nature and complexity of the work to be performed, the cost and availability of materials, the impact of delayed performance, the availability and timing of funding from the customer, and the timing of product deliveries. These estimates are based on the company best judgment. A significant change in one or more of these estimates could affect the profitability of one or more of the company contracts. The company reviews its contract estimates periodically to assess revisions in contract values and estimated costs at completion and reflects changes in estimates in the current and future periods under the reallocation method. Business Aircraft. The company accounts for contracts for aircraft certified by the FAA in accordance with Statement of Position 81-1. These contracts usually provide for two major milestones: the manufacture of the green aircraft (i.e., before exterior painting and installation of customer-selected interiors and optional avionics) and its completion. The company records revenue at two points: when green aircraft are delivered to, and accepted by, the customer and when the customer accepts final delivery of the fully outfitted aircraft. General Dynamics 2005 Annual Report 31 Table of Contents The company does not recognize revenue at green delivery unless (1) a contract has been executed with the customer and (2) the customer can be expected to satisfy its obligations under the contract, as evidenced by the receipt of deposits from the customer. Pre-owned Aircraft Inventories. In connection with orders for new aircraft, the company routinely offers customers trade-in options. Under these options, if exercised, the company will accept trade-in aircraft at a predetermined price based on estimated fair value. It is the company policy to limit its investment in pre-owned aircraft inventory at any point in time to $200, unless specifically authorized. Once acquired in connection with a sale of new aircraft, the company records pre-owned aircraft at the lower of trade-in value or estimated net realizable value. The company treats any excess of the trade-in price above the net realizable value as a reduction of revenue upon the recording of the new aircraft sales transaction. The company also regularly assesses the carrying value of pre-owned aircraft in inventory and adjusts the carrying value to net realizable value when appropriate. The company determines net realizable value by using both internal and external aircraft valuation information. These valuations involve estimates and assumptions about many factors, including current market conditions, future market conditions, the age and condition of the aircraft and the availability of the aircraft in the market. These estimates are based on the company best judgment. Gross margins on sales of pre-owned aircraft can vary from quarter to quarter depending on the mix of aircraft sold and current market conditions. Commitments and Contingencies. The company is subject to litigation and other legal proceedings arising out of the ordinary course of its business or arising under provisions relating to the protection of the environment. Estimating liabilities and costs associated with these matters requires the use of judgment. The company records a charge against earnings when a liability associated with claims or pending or threatened litigation matters is probable and when the company exposure is reasonably estimable. The ultimate resolution of any exposure to the company may change as further facts and circumstances become known. Deferred Contract Costs. Certain costs incurred in the performance of the company government contracts are recorded under GAAP but are not currently allocable to contracts. Such costs include a portion of the company estimated workers compensation, other insurance-related assessments, post-retirement benefits and environmental expenses. These costs will become allocable to contracts when they are paid. As permitted by AICPA Audit and Accounting Guide, Audits of Federal Government Contractors , the company has elected to defer these costs in contracts in process until they are paid, at which time the costs are charged to contracts and recovered from the government. The company expects to recover these costs through ongoing business, including both existing backlog and probable follow-on contracts. This business base includes numerous contracts for which the company is the sole source or one of two suppliers on long-term defense programs. The company regularly assesses the probability of recovery of these costs under its current and probable follow-on contracts. This assessment requires the company to make assumptions about future contract costs, the extent of cost recovery under the company contracts and the amount of future contract activity. These estimates are based on the company best judgment. If the backlog in the future does not support the continued deferral of these costs, the profitability of the company remaining contracts could be adversely affected. Retirement Plans. The company defined-benefit pension and other post-retirement benefit costs and obligations depend on various assumptions and estimates. The key assumptions relate to discount rates used to estimate future liabilities and long-term rates of return on plan assets. The company determines the discount rate used each year based on the rate of return currently available on high-quality fixed-income investments with a maturity that is consistent with the projected benefit payout period. The company determines the long-term rate of return on assets based on historical returns and the current and expected asset allocation strategy. These estimates are based on the company best judgment, including consideration of both current and future market conditions. In the event a change in any of the assumptions is warranted, future pension and post-retirement benefit cost could increase or decrease. If the assumed long-term rate of return on pension plan assets increased or decreased by 25 basis points, the company net pension income associated with its commercial plans would have increased or decreased by approximately $3 in 2005. Likewise, had the interest rate used to discount the company projected pension obligation increased or decreased by 25 basis points, the net pension income associated with the commercial plans would have increased or decreased by approximately $1 in 2005. A 25 basis-point increase or decrease in either the rate of return on assets or the interest rate used for benefit obligations for the company post-retirement benefit plans would have decreased or increased the 2005 post-retirement benefit cost by approximately $1. The company contractual arrangements with the U.S. government provide for the recovery of contributions to the company government plans. As permitted by AICPA Audit and Accounting Guide, Audits of Federal Government Contractors , the company has elected to defer recognition of the cumulative earnings in its government plans to provide a better matching of revenues and expenses. As such, the company future income is not subject to the consequences of changes in the assumptions associated with these plans. Management believes that its judgment is applied consistently and produces financial information that fairly depicts the results of operations for all periods presented. 32 General Dynamics 2005 Annual Report Table of Contents New Accounting Standards In December 2004, the Financial Accounting Standards Board (FASB) issued Statement of Financial Accounting Standards (SFAS) No. 123 (revised 2004), Share-Based Payment, a revision of SFAS No. 123, Accounting for Stock-Based Compensation [SFAS 123(R)]. SFAS 123(R) supersedes Accounting Principles Board Opinion No. 25, Accounting for Stock Issued to Employees . SFAS 123(R) requires all share-based payments to employees, including grants of employee stock options, to be recognized in the financial statements based on their fair value. SFAS 123(R) is effective in the first quarter of 2006. Based on available information, the company expects the adoption of SFAS 123(R) to reduce its net earnings by approximately $35 to $40 in 2006. In May 2005, the FASB issued SFAS No. 154, Accounting Changes and Error Corrections, a replacement of APB Opinion No. 20, and FASB Statement No. 3 . SFAS 154 changes the requirements for accounting and reporting a change in accounting principle. The Statement requires a restatement of prior period financial statements upon adoption of a voluntary change in accounting principle rather than recording the cumulative effect of the change in net earnings in the current period. SFAS 154 is effective for the fiscal year ending December 31, 2006. The company does not expect the adoption of SFAS 154 to have a material effect on its results of operations, financial condition or cash flows.
