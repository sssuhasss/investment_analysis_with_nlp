Item 7. Management Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations. GENERAL. Our revenues and net income are derived primarily from investment advisory services provided to individual and institutional investors in our sponsored mutual funds and other managed investment portfolios. The other managed investment portfolios include separately managed accounts, subadvised funds, and other sponsored investment portfolios including common trust funds and mutual funds offered to investors outside the United States and through variable annuity life insurance plans. Investment advisory clients outside the United States account for 11% of our assets under management at December 31, 2011. We manage a broad range of U.S., international and global stock, bond, and money market mutual funds and other investment portfolios, which meet the varied needs and objectives of individual and institutional investors. Investment advisory Page 23 Table of Contents revenues depend largely on the total value and composition of assets under our management. Accordingly, fluctuations in financial markets and in the composition of assets under management affect our revenues and results of operations. BACKGROUND. U.S. equity markets ended 2011 virtually unchanged from the end of 2010 despite experiencing wide trading ranges over the course of the year. Economic and geopolitical concerns weighed heavily on markets at times during the year and contributed to high volatility. The positive momentum in equity markets in late 2010 continued into 2011 as signs of an improving U.S. economy and the release of strong corporate earnings helped lift major indexes by the end of April to new highs not seen since March 2009. Equities began to fall in May and continued to decline through the summer, as the U.S. and European economies showed signs of weakening, the European debt crisis intensified, and U.S. Congress struggled to reach an agreement on deficit reduction and raising the federal debt ceiling. The uncertainties surrounding these macro concerns combined with Standard & Poor downgrade in August of the U.S. government long-term sovereign credit rating led investors in search of less risky assets and increased selling pressure on markets through early October. Volatility in the markets continued through the end of the year, despite favorable U.S. economic data, as the bipartisan congressional super committee failed to reach a deficit reduction agreement and European leaders failed to develop a concrete plan to address their own debt crisis. In this volatile environment, the global stock indexes produced flat to negative results. The S&P 500 Index of large-cap companies in leading industries of the U.S. economy returned 2.1% in 2011, while the NASDAQ Composite Index, which is heavily weighted with technology companies, was down 1.8% (excluding dividends) and the Russell 2000, which generally reflects smaller companies, decreased 4.2%. Performance for stock markets outside the U.S. was notably worse, although a strengthening U.S. dollar decreased the magnitude of the losses in dollar terms. In 2011, the MSCI EAFE Index, which measures the performance of mostly large-cap stocks in Europe, Australasia, and the Far East, produced an 11.7% loss while the MSCI Emerging Markets Index decreased 18.2%. Despite the S&P downgrade, Treasury yields fell to historic lows in the third quarter of 2011 and prices rose as investors sought the safety of these securities in the wake of the equity market weakness, the intensifying European debt crisis, and slowing economic growth. To support the U.S. economy, the Federal Reserve announced in the third quarter of 2011 that it would keep the federal funds target rate near 0% until at least mid-2013, trade short-term Treasury holdings for longer-term issues, and resume mortgage-backed security purchases. Treasury yields ended the year below their levels at the end of 2010 as nervous global investors continued to seek out less risky investments. The yield on the benchmark 10-year U.S. Treasury at December 31, 2011, was 1.9%, a decrease of 141 basis points from the end of 2010. Bonds produced positive overall returns in 2011, as strong gains among long-term government bonds compensated for lower returns in other categories. Municipal and corporate bonds did very well, while high yield securities trailed as solid returns in the first half of 2011 were followed by flat performance in the second half of 2011 as investors sought less risky assets. For 2011, the Barclays Capital Municipal Bond Index returned 10.7%, the Barclays Capital U.S. Aggregate Index gained 7.8%, and the Credit Suisse High Yield Index was up 5.5%. A similar trend was seen in the non-U.S. bond markets though the Page 24 Table of Contents gains were limited by a stronger U.S. dollar versus other currencies. The J.P. Morgan Emerging Markets Index Plus gained 9.2% in 2011, while the Barclays Capital Global Aggregate Ex-U.S. Dollar Bond Index was up 4.4%. ASSETS UNDER MANAGEMENT. With an uncertain and volatile market environment as a backdrop, our assets under management increased $7.5 billion over the course of 2011 and ended the year at $489.5 billion. Net cash inflows from investors in 2011 of $14.1 billion were partially offset by market depreciation and distributions not reinvested of $6.6 billion. Assets under management (in billions) at the end of the year and changes over the year are detailed below. Assets under management by investment portfolio December 31 2009 2010 2011 T. Rowe Price mutual funds $ 232.7 $ 282.6 $ 289.4 Other investment portfolios 158.6 199.4 200.1 Total $ 391.3 $ 482.0 $ 489.5 Assets under management by asset class December 31 2009 2010 2011 Stock and blended asset $ 290.4 $ 360.6 $ 352.4 Fixed income portfolios 100.9 121.4 137.1 Total $ 391.3 $ 482.0 $ 489.5 Components of changes in assets under management Year ended 2009 2010 2011 Assets under management at beginning of year $ 276.3 $ 391.3 $ 482.0 Net cash inflows Sponsored mutual funds in the U.S. 12.5 13.6 11.0 Other portfolios 10.2 16.7 3.1 22.7 30.3 14.1 Net market gains (losses) and income 92.7 60.8 (5.8 ) Mutual fund distributions not reinvested (.4 ) (.4 ) (.8 ) Increase during year 115.0 90.7 7.5 Assets under management at end of year $ 391.3 $ 482.0 $ 489.5 Our 2009 and 2010 net cash inflows were sourced most significantly from third-party financial intermediaries and from institutional investors around the world, whereas net cash flows in 2011 were sourced primarily from third-party financial intermediaries. Our relative investment performance over much of this period and brand awareness contributed significantly to attracting net inflows to our firm. We incur significant expenditures to attract new investment advisory clients and additional investments from our existing clients. These efforts often involve costs that precede any future revenues that we may recognize from increases to our assets under management. Page 25 Table of Contents RESULTS OF OPERATIONS. In 2011, we changed the presentation of our consolidated statements of income. We are presenting distribution and servicing fees earned from 12b-1 plans of the Advisor, R, and VIP II classes of our sponsored mutual funds, previously included in administrative fees, as a separate line to enhance transparency of these fees. We also are presenting as a separate line the offsetting distribution and servicing costs, previously included in other operating expenses, paid to third-party financial intermediaries who source those share classes noted above. Investment income earned by our savings bank subsidiary, previously presented on its own, is being reported net of interest expense paid on savings bank deposits. The line was renamed net revenue of savings bank subsidiary and the details of this line are included in note 4 to the consolidated financial statements. All amounts for the comparable calendar years have been reclassified to conform to the 2011 presentation. 2011 versus 2010. Investment advisory revenues were up 15.9%, or $322.2 million, to $2.3 billion in 2011, as average assets under our management increased $74.5 billion to $497.1 billion. The average annualized fee rate earned on our assets under management was 47.3 basis points during 2011 compared to 48.0 basis points earned in 2010. The decrease in our average annualized fee rate is primarily a result of the $11.3 million increase in money market management fees voluntarily waived by the firm in order to maintain a positive yield for fund investors. The firm waived $36.4 million in money market fees in 2011 compared to $25.1 million in 2010. The firm expects that these fee waivers will continue in 2012. Net revenues increased $379.9 million, or 16.0%, to $2.7 billion. Operating expenses were $1.5 billion in 2011, an increase of $189.5 million, or 14.2%. Overall, net operating income for 2011 increased $190.4 million, or 18.4%, to $1.2 billion. The increase in our average assets under management and resulting advisory revenue increased our operating margin for 2011 to 44.7% from 43.8% in 2010. Net income increased $101.0 million, or 15.0%, to $773.2 million from the 2010 period. Our diluted earnings per share on our common stock increased 15.4% to $2.92 from the $2.53 earned in 2010. Revenues Investment advisory revenues earned from the T. Rowe Price mutual funds distributed in the United States were $1.6 billion in 2011, an increase of 15.3%, or $213.3 million, on higher average mutual fund assets. Average mutual fund assets in 2011 were $292.1 billion, an increase of 16.5% from the 2010 average. Mutual fund assets at December 31, 2011, were $289.4 billion, up $6.8 billion from the end of 2010. Net inflows to the mutual funds during 2011 were $11.0 billion. These net inflows include $7.5 billion that originated in our target-date retirement funds, which in turn invest in a broadly diversified portfolio of other Price funds, and automatically rebalance to maintain their specific asset allocation weightings. Net cash inflows of $6.6 billion were added to our stock and blended asset funds, $3.9 billion to our bond funds, and $.5 billion were added to our money market funds. The Overseas Stock, International Stock, New America Growth, Emerging Markets Stock, and New Income funds each added more than $1.2 billion in net inflows for a combined total of $6.8 billion. Fund net inflow amounts in 2011 are presented net of $1.4 billion that was transferred to the other investment portfolios during the year. Market depreciation and income not reinvested lowered our mutual fund assets under management by $4.2 billion in 2011. Page 26 Table of Contents Investment advisory revenues earned on the other investment portfolios that we manage increased $108.9 million, or 17.2%, to $741.4 million. Average assets in these portfolios were $205.0 billion during 2011, an increase of $33.2 billion, or 19.3%, from the 2010 year. Ending assets at December 31, 2011, were $200.1 billion, an increase of $.7 billion from the end of 2010. Net inflows into these portfolios in 2011 were $3.1 billion. We experienced strong cash inflows into our subadvised funds from third-party intermediaries, into our fixed income portfolios from institutional investors, and into our other sponsored portfolios during the year. These inflows were partially offset by outflows from our equity portfolios by a few institutional investors that were reducing risk in their portfolios in the wake of the volatile market environment experienced in 2011. Lower market valuations reduced assets under management in these portfolios by $2.4 billion. Administrative fees increased $26.9 million to $321.2 million in 2011. The increase is attributable to our mutual fund servicing activities and defined contribution recordkeeping services for the mutual funds and their investors. Changes in administrative fees are generally offset by similar changes in related operating expenses that are incurred to provide services to the funds and their investors. Distribution and servicing fees earned from 12b-1 plans of the Advisor, R, and VIP II classes of our sponsored mutual funds were $74.6 million in 2011, an increase of $31.4 million from 2010. The increase includes $7.3 million recognized on greater assets under management in these share classes, and $24.1 million earned primarily on R class shares in the last nine months of 2011 for which the comparable 2010 fees were netted against related distribution and servicing costs. The 12b-1 fees earned are offset entirely by the cost paid to third-party intermediaries who source these assets. These costs are reported as distribution and servicing costs on the face of the consolidated income statements. Operating expenses Compensation and related costs were $969.8 million, an increase of $109.4 million, or 12.7%, compared to 2010. The largest part of the increase is attributable to a $46.9 million increase in salaries and related benefits, which results from a 5.6% annual increase in our average staff size. The 2011 change also includes a $36.4 million increase in our annual variable compensation programs. Greater use of outside contractors to meet growing business demands increased our 2011 costs by $11.2 million. The remainder of the change from 2010 is attributable to higher non-cash stock-based compensation expense and other employee related costs. At December 31, 2011, we employed 5,255 associates, an increase of 4.0% from the end of 2010, to support both business growth and added capabilities. Advertising and promotion expenditures were $90.8 million, up $3.9 million, or 4.5%, compared to 2010. We currently estimate that advertising and promotion expenditures for 2012 will increase modestly from 2011 levels. We vary our level of spending based on market conditions and investor demand as well as our efforts to expand our investor base globally. Occupancy and facility costs together with depreciation expense increased $15.3 million, or 8.9%, versus 2010. The change includes the impact of placing our new technology support facility into service in February 2011, as well as the added costs to update our technology capabilities, including related maintenance programs, to meet increasing business demands. Page 27 Table of Contents Other operating expenses increased $29.5 million, or 17.5%, from 2010. The charitable contribution made to the T. Rowe Price Foundation in 2011 was higher than in 2010, and we increased our spending on professional fees, information, and other third-party services, and travel to meet increasing business demands. The increases in these costs were offset by the $16.4 million charge incurred in 2010 from the one-time contribution made to certain money market funds that did not reoccur in 2011. Non-operating investment income Our non-operating investment income, which includes interest income as well as the recognition of investment gains and losses, was down $9.8 million from the 2010 period. This decrease is primarily due to the 2010 period including $7.6 million in gains realized on the sale of certain mutual fund investments and $2.2 million recognized in early 2010 on the settlement and valuation of the forward contracts used to hedge the foreign currency exposure associated with our investment in UTI Asset Management Company Limited (UTI). The 2011 period includes $6.4 million in net earnings from our investment in UTI, an increase of $1.1 million over the earnings recognized in 2010. Provision for income taxes Our effective tax rate for 2011 is 38.2% as compared to 37.2% in 2010. The increase is primarily attributable to higher effective state tax rates as well as greater discrete tax benefits recognized in 2010 from the settlement of state income tax positions and the firm international reorganization. The firm currently estimates its effective tax rate for 2012 will be about 37.7%. 2010 versus 2009. Investment advisory revenues were up 31.1%, or $480.7 million, to $2.0 billion in 2010, as average assets under our management increased $101.3 billion to $422.6 billion. The average annualized fee rate earned on our assets under management was 48.0 basis points during 2010, virtually unchanged from the 48.1 basis points earned in 2009, including the effect of the voluntary fee waivers made to our money market funds. Net revenues increased $499.8 million, or 26.8%, to nearly $2.4 billion. Operating expenses were $1.3 billion in 2010, an increase of $164.9 million, or 14.1%. This increase includes the $16.4 million charge related to the one-time contribution made to certain of our money market funds. Overall, net operating income for 2010 increased $334.9 million, or 47.7%, to more than $1.0 billion. The increase in our average assets under management and resulting advisory revenue increased our operating margin for 2010 to 43.8% from 37.6% for 2009. We recognized non-operating investment income of $33.5 million in 2010 compared to investment losses in 2009 of $12.7 million. The 2009 year included $36.1 million in other than temporary impairment charges recognized in the first quarter on our investments in sponsored mutual funds. Net income increased $238.6 million, or 55%, to $672.2 million from the 2009 period resulting in diluted earnings per share on our common stock to increase 53% to $2.53 from the $1.65 earned in 2009. Revenues Investment advisory revenues earned from the T. Rowe Price mutual funds distributed in the United States increased 30.5%, or $326.0 million, to nearly $1.4 billion. Average mutual fund assets in 2010 were $250.8 billion, an increase of 30.8% from the 2009 average. Page 28 Table of Contents Net inflows to the mutual funds during 2010 were $13.6 billion, including $5.9 billion originating in our target-date Retirement Funds. Fund net inflow amounts in 2010 are presented net of $1.0 billion that was transferred to our target-date retirement trusts from the Retirement Funds. Our bond funds had net inflows of $7.7 billion. The New Income Fund had net inflows of $2.2 billion and the Short-Term Bond Fund added $1.4 billion. The stock and blended asset funds added $6.3 billion of net inflows, including $1.4 billion into the Value Fund. The Mid-Cap Value, Equity Income, Institutional Large-Cap Growth, and Dividend Growth funds each added more than $500 million for a combined total of $2.2 billion in net inflows. The money market funds had net outflows of $400 million. Higher market valuations and income increased fund assets by $36.3 billion. Investment advisory revenues earned on the other investment portfolios that we manage increased $154.7 million, or 32.4%, to $632.5 million. Average assets in these portfolios were $171.8 billion during 2010, an increase of $42.3 billion, or 32.7%, from the 2009 year. Net inflows primarily from institutional investors and third-party financial intermediaries were $16.7 billion, while market appreciation and income added $24.1 billion. These net inflows were invested primarily in our equity mandates, though we also saw strong demand for our fixed income strategies. Net inflows include a transfer of $1.0 billion from the target-date retirement funds. Administrative fees increased $6.5 million to $294.3 million in 2010. Increases in our mutual fund servicing and defined contribution plan revenues of $10.2 million were offset by a $3.7 million decrease in brokerage fees due to a reduction in per-trade commissions charged beginning July 1, 2010, to customers with substantial assets. Changes in administrative fees are generally offset by similar changes in related operating expenses that are incurred to provide services to the funds and their investors. Distribution and servicing fees earned from 12b-1 plans of the Advisor and R classes of our sponsored mutual fund shares were $43.2 million in 2010, an increase of $12.2 million from 2009. We recognized higher fees in 2010 on greater assets under management in these share classes. Changes in these fees are offset by an equal increase in the distribution and servicing costs paid to those third-party financial intermediaries that distribute these assets. Operating expenses Compensation and related costs, increased $87.0 million, or 11.2%, compared to 2009. The largest part of the change is attributable to a $63.9 million increase in our annual variable compensation programs. Greater use of outside contractors increased our 2010 costs by $14.1 million with the remainder of the change primarily attributable to higher other employee benefits and employee related costs. At December 31, 2010, we employed 5,052 associates, an increase of 5.2% from the end of 2009, to support both business growth and added capabilities. Advertising and promotion expenditures were up $13.7 million, or 18.7%, compared to 2009 in response to investor interest in recovering markets over the 2010 period. Distribution and servicing costs paid to third-party financial intermediaries that distribute our Advisor and R classes of mutual fund shares increased $12.2 million from 2009, as average assets under management in these classes was greater. These costs are offset by an equal increase in our distribution and servicing fees earned from 12b-1 plans of these classes, as discussed above. Page 29 Table of Contents Occupancy and facility costs together with depreciation expense increased $4.1 million, or 2.4%, versus 2009. The amount of office space occupied, and the operating costs of our facilities have all risen to meet increased business demands. These increasing business demands have also led us to upgrade our technology capabilities and related maintenance programs. Other operating expenses increased $47.9 million, or 39.7%, from 2009. This increase includes a $16.4 million charge related to the one-time contribution made to certain money market funds to offset the effects of cumulative net losses realized in recent years. The remainder of the increase relates to higher consulting fees, travel costs, and other professional services, incurred to meet increasing business demands. Non-operating investment income (loss) Our non-operating investment income activity resulted in a net gain of $33.5 million in 2010, compared to a net loss of $12.7 million in the 2009 period. This change of $46.2 million includes $36.1 million in other than temporary impairments recognized on our investments in sponsored mutual funds in 2009. The change also includes $1.3 million in more gains recognized in the 2010 period for the settlement and valuation of a series of non-deliverable forward contracts used to economically hedge the foreign currency exposure associated with the UTI acquisition price and $5.3 million in net earnings from our investment in UTI. Provision for income taxes The 2010 provision for income taxes as a percentage of pretax income is 37.2%. The 2010 income tax provision includes nonrecurring discrete benefits of .4% related to the settlement of prior years state income tax positions and .2% from the firm reorganization of its international entities, which was completed to help realize additional operational efficiencies. CAPITAL RESOURCES AND LIQUIDITY. During 2011, stockholders equity increased from $3.3 billion to $3.4 billion. We repurchased nearly 8.7 million common shares for $479.7 million in 2011 from existing cash balances and cash generated from operations. Tangible book value is $2.8 billion at December 31, 2011, and our cash and cash equivalents and our mutual fund investment holdings total nearly $1.7 billion. Given the availability of these financial resources, we do not maintain an available external source of liquidity. At December 31, 2011, we had outstanding commitments to make additional contributions totaling $42.5 million to various investment partnerships in which we have an existing investment. We presently anticipate funding 2012 property and equipment expenditures of about $100 million from our cash balances and operating cash inflows. 2011 versus 2010 . Operating activities during 2011 provided cash flows of $948.4 million, up $215.6 million from 2010, including a $101.0 million increase in net income. The increase also includes an $81.7 million change in the timing differences in the cash settlement of our income taxes, accounts receivable and accrued revenues and payables, and accrued liabilities. Page 30 Table of Contents Net cash used in investing activities totaled $165.0 million, down $111.9 million from the 2010 period. Cash flows in 2010 included $143.6 million in cash used to purchase our 26% equity interest in UTI. We spent $35.7 million less in property and equipment expenditures in 2011 compared to 2010 due to the construction of our technology support facility being substantially complete at the end of 2010. These reductions in cash used in 2011 were offset by an increase of $57.0 million in net investments made into our sponsored mutual funds compared to the 2010 period. Net cash used in financing activities was $698.6 million in 2011, up $312.5 million from the 2010 period. We increased our stock repurchases by expending $239.7 million more in 2011 compared to the 2010 year. Dividends paid during 2011 increased $39.0 million from the 2010 period due primarily to a $.04 increase in our quarterly per-share dividend. The impact of dividends paid and stock repurchases was greater in 2011, as proceeds related to our stock-based compensation plans decreased $47.8 million on reduced exercise activity. 2010 versus 2009 . Operating activities during 2010 provided cash flows of $732.8 million, up $197.2 million from 2009, including a $238.6 million increase in net income. Cash flows in 2009 also included the impact of $36.1 million in other than temporary impairments of our investments in sponsored mutual funds that did not recur in 2010. Net cash used in investing activities totaled $276.9 million, up $110.2 million from the 2009 period, primarily from the purchase of a 26% equity interest in UTI for $142.4 million plus related transaction costs incurred in the 2010 period of $1.2 million. We spent $15.9 million less in property and equipment expenditures in 2010 compared to 2009 due to the construction of our two new facilities in Owings Mills, Maryland being completed in late 2009. Net cash used in financing activities was $386.1 million in 2010, up $141.4 million from the 2009 period. We increased our stock repurchases by expending $169.0 million more in 2010 compared to the 2009 year. Dividends paid during 2010 increased $22.0 million from the 2009 period due primarily to a $.02 increase in our quarterly per-share dividend. These uses of cash were offset by $35.3 million more in cash proceeds from option exercises compared to 2009 as the higher market valuations of our common stock experienced in 2010 led employees to exercise. CONTRACTUAL OBLIGATIONS. The following table presents a summary of our future obligations (in millions) under the terms of existing operating leases and other contractual cash purchase commitments at December 31, 2011. Other purchase commitments include contractual amounts that will be due for the purchase of goods or services to be used in our operations and may be cancelable at earlier times than those indicated, under certain conditions that may involve termination fees. Because these obligations are generally of a normal recurring nature, we expect that we will fund them from future cash flows from operations. The information presented does not include operating expenses or capital expenditures that will be committed in the normal course of operations in 2012 and future years. The information also excludes the $4.7 million of uncertain tax positions discussed in Note 9 to our consolidated financial statements because it is not possible to estimate the time period in which a payment might be made to the tax authorities. Page 31 Table of Contents Total 2012 2013-14 2015-16 Later Noncancelable operating leases $ 185 $ 31 $ 63 $ 57 $ 34 Other purchase commitments 160 112 38 10 - Total $ 345 $ 143 $ 101 $ 67 $ 34 We also have outstanding commitments to fund additional contributions to investment partnerships in which we have an existing investment totaling $42.5 million at December 31, 2011. CRITICAL ACCOUNTING POLICIES. The preparation of financial statements often requires the selection of specific accounting methods and policies from among several acceptable alternatives. Further, significant estimates and judgments may be required in selecting and applying those methods and policies in the recognition of the assets and liabilities in our balance sheet, the revenues and expenses in our statement of income, and the information that is contained in our significant accounting policies and notes to consolidated financial statements. Making these estimates and judgments requires the analysis of information concerning events that may not yet be complete and of facts and circumstances that may change over time. Accordingly, actual amounts or future results can differ materially from those estimates that we include currently in our consolidated financial statements, significant accounting policies, and notes. We present those significant accounting policies used in the preparation of our consolidated financial statements as an integral part of those statements within this 2011 Annual Report. In the following discussion, we highlight and explain further certain of those policies that are most critical to the preparation and understanding of our financial statements. Other than temporary impairments of available-for-sale securities . We generally classify our investment holdings in sponsored mutual funds and the debt securities held for investment by our savings bank subsidiary as available-for-sale. At the end of each quarter, we mark the carrying amount of each investment holding to fair value and recognize an unrealized gain or loss as a component of comprehensive income within the statement of stockholders equity. We next review each individual security position that has an unrealized loss or impairment to determine if that impairment is other than temporary. In determining whether a mutual fund holding is other than temporarily impaired, we consider many factors, including the duration of time it has existed, the severity of the impairment, any subsequent changes in value, and our intent and ability to hold the security for a period of time sufficient for an anticipated recovery in fair value. Subject to the other considerations noted above, with respect to duration of time, we believe a mutual fund holding with an unrealized loss that has persisted daily throughout the six months between quarter-ends is generally presumed to have an other than temporary impairment. We may also recognize an other than temporary loss of less than six months in our statement of income if the particular circumstances of the underlying investment do not warrant our belief that a near-term recovery is possible. An impaired debt security held by our savings bank subsidiary is considered to have an other than temporary loss that we will recognize in our statement of income if the impairment is caused by a change in credit quality that affects our ability to recover our amortized cost or if we intend to sell the security or believe that it is more likely than not that we will be required to sell the security before recovering cost. Minor impairments of 5% or less are generally considered temporary. Page 32 Table of Contents Other than temporary impairments of equity method investments . We evaluate our equity method investments, including our investment in UTI, for impairment when events or changes in circumstances indicate that the carrying value of the investment exceeds its fair value, and the decline in fair value is other than temporary. Goodwill . We internally conduct, manage and report our operations as one investment advisory business. We do not have distinct operating segments or components that separately constitute a business. Accordingly, we attribute goodwill to a single reportable business segment and reporting unit our investment advisory business. We evaluate the carrying amount of goodwill in our balance sheet for possible impairment on an annual basis in the third quarter of each year using a fair value approach. Goodwill would be considered impaired whenever our historical carrying amount exceeds the fair value of our investment advisory business. Our annual testing has demonstrated that the fair value of our investment advisory business (our market capitalization) exceeds our carrying amount (our stockholders equity) and, therefore, no impairment exists. Should we reach a different conclusion in the future, additional work would be performed to ascertain the amount of the non-cash impairment charge to be recognized. We must also perform impairment testing at other times if an event or circumstance occurs indicating that it is more likely than not that an impairment has been incurred. The maximum future impairment of goodwill that we could incur is the amount recognized in our balance sheet, $665.7 million. Stock options . We recognize stock option-based compensation expense in our consolidated statement of income using a fair value based method. Fair value methods use a valuation model for shorter-term, market-traded financial instruments to theoretically value stock option grants even though they are not available for trading and are of longer duration. The Black-Scholes option-pricing model that we use includes the input of certain variables that are dependent on future expectations, including the expected lives of our options from grant date to exercise date, the volatility of our underlying common shares in the market over that time period, and the rate of dividends that we will pay during that time. Our estimates of these variables are made for the purpose of using the valuation model to determine an expense for each reporting period and are not subsequently adjusted. Unlike most of our expenses, the resulting charge to earnings using a fair value based method is a non-cash charge that is never measured by, or adjusted based on, a cash outflow. Provision for income taxes . After compensation and related costs, our provision for income taxes on our earnings is our largest annual expense. We operate in numerous states and countries through our various subsidiaries, and must allocate our income, expenses, and earnings under the various laws and regulations of each of these taxing jurisdictions. Accordingly, our provision for income taxes represents our total estimate of the liability that we have incurred in doing business each year in all of our locations. Annually, we file tax returns that represent our filing positions with each jurisdiction and settle our return liabilities. Each jurisdiction has the right to audit those returns and may take different positions with respect to income and expense allocations and taxable earnings determinations. From time to time, we may also provide for estimated liabilities associated with uncertain tax return filing positions that are subject Page 33 Table of Contents to, or in the process of, being audited by various tax authorities. Because the determination of our annual provision is subject to judgments and estimates, it is likely that actual results will vary from those recognized in our financial statements. As a result, we recognize additions to, or reductions of, income tax expense during a reporting period that pertain to prior period provisions as our estimated liabilities are revised and actual tax returns and tax audits are settled. We recognize any such prior period adjustment in the discrete quarterly period in which it is determined. NEWLY ISSUED BUT NOT YET ADOPTED ACCOUNTING GUIDANCE. In May 2011, the FASB issued amended guidance clarifying how to measure and disclose fair value. We do not believe the adoption of such amended guidance on January 1, 2012, will have a significant effect on our consolidated financial statements. We have also considered all other newly issued accounting guidance that is applicable to our operations and the preparation of our consolidated statements, including that which we have not yet adopted. We do not believe that any such guidance will have a material effect on our financial position or results of operation. FORWARD-LOOKING INFORMATION. From time to time, information or statements provided by or on behalf of T. Rowe Price, including those within this report, may contain certain forward-looking information, including information or anticipated information relating to: our revenues, net income, and earnings per share on common stock; changes in the amount and composition of our assets under management; our expense levels; our estimated effective income tax rate; and our expectations regarding financial markets, future transactions, dividends, investments, capital expenditures, and other conditions. Readers are cautioned that any forward-looking information provided by or on behalf of T. Rowe Price is not a guarantee of future performance. Actual results may differ materially from those in forward-looking information because of various factors including, but not limited to, those discussed below and in Item 1A, Risk Factors, of this Form 10-K Annual Report. Further, forward-looking statements speak only as of the date on which they are made, and we undertake no obligation to update any forward-looking statement to reflect events or circumstances after the date on which it is made or to reflect the occurrence of unanticipated events. Our future revenues and results of operations will fluctuate primarily due to changes in the total value and composition of assets under our management. Such changes result from many factors including, among other things: cash inflows and outflows in the T. Rowe Price mutual funds and other managed investment portfolios; fluctuations in global financial markets that result in appreciation or depreciation of the assets under our management; our introduction of new mutual funds and investment portfolios; and changes in retirement savings trends relative to participant-directed investments and defined contribution plans. The ability to attract and retain investors assets under our management is dependent on investor sentiment and confidence; the relative investment performance of the Price mutual funds and other managed investment portfolios as compared to competing offerings and market indexes; the ability to maintain our investment management and administrative fees at appropriate levels; competitive conditions in the mutual fund, asset management, and broader financial services sectors; and our level of success in implementing our strategy to expand our business. Our revenues are substantially dependent on fees earned under contracts with the Price funds and Page 34 Table of Contents could be adversely affected if the independent directors of one or more of the Price funds terminated or significantly altered the terms of the investment management or related administrative services agreements. Non-operating investment income (loss) will also fluctuate primarily due to the size of our investments, changes in their market valuations, and any other than temporary impairments that may arise or, in the case of our equity method investments, our proportionate share of the investee net income. Our future results are also dependent upon the level of our expenses, which are subject to fluctuation for the following or other reasons: changes in the level of our advertising expenses in response to market conditions, including our efforts to expand our investment advisory business to investors outside the United States and to further penetrate our distribution channels within the United States; variations in the level of total compensation expense due to, among other things, bonuses, stock option grants, other incentive awards, changes in our employee count and mix, and competitive factors; any goodwill or other asset impairment that may arise; fluctuation in foreign currency exchange rates applicable to the costs of our international operations; expenses and capital costs, such as technology assets, depreciation, amortization, and research and development, incurred to maintain and enhance our administrative and operating services infrastructure; unanticipated costs that may be incurred to protect investor accounts and the goodwill of our clients; and disruptions of services, including those provided by third parties, such as facilities, communications, power, and the mutual fund transfer agent and accounting systems. Our business is also subject to substantial governmental regulation, and changes in legal, regulatory, accounting, tax, and compliance requirements may have a substantial effect on our operations and results, including but not limited to effects on costs that we incur and effects on investor interest in mutual funds and investing in general, or in particular classes of mutual funds or other investments.
