Item 7. Management Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations. The following Management Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations ( MD&A ) is provided as a supplement to, and should be read in conjunction with, our audited consolidated financial statements and the accompanying notes presented in Item 8, Consolidated Financial Statements and Supplementary Data. Note references are to the notes to consolidated financial statements included in Item 8. Certain prior year amounts have been reclassified to conform to the current year presentation. All references to net earnings per share are to diluted net earnings per share. Amounts and percentages may not total due to rounding. OVERVIEW See Part 1. Item 1 for a detailed description and discussion of the company business. CarMax is the nation largest retailer of used vehicles. We operate in two reportable segments: CarMax Sales Operations and CarMax Auto Finance ( CAF ). Our CarMax Sales Operations segment consists of all aspects of our auto merchandising and service operations, excluding financing provided by CAF. Our CAF segment consists solely of our own finance operation that provides vehicle financing through CarMax stores. CarMax Sales Operations Our sales operations segment consists of retail sales of used vehicles and related products and services, such as wholesale vehicle sales; the sale of extended protection plan ( EPP ) products, which include extended service plans ( ESP ) and guaranteed asset protection ( GAP ); and vehicle repair service. GAP is designed to cover the unpaid balance on an auto loan in the event of a total loss of the vehicle or unrecovered theft. We focus on addressing the major sources of customer dissatisfaction with traditional auto retailers while maximizing operating efficiencies. We offer low, no haggle prices; a broad selection of CarMax Quality Certified used vehicles; value-added EPP products; and superior customer service. Our customers finance the majority of the retail vehicles purchased from us, and the availability of on-the-spot financing is a critical component of the sales process. We provide financing to qualified retail customers through CAF and our arrangements with several industry-leading third-party finance providers. All of the finance offers, whether by CAF or our third-party providers, are backed by a 3 day payoff option. As of February 28, 2015, we operated 144 used car stores in 73 markets, covering 47 mid-sized markets, 20 large markets and 6 small markets. We define mid-sized markets as those with television viewing populations generally between 600,000 and 3 million people. As of that date, we also conducted wholesale auctions at 62 used car stores and we operated four new car franchises. CarMax Auto Finance In addition to third-party financing providers, we provide vehicle financing through CAF, which offers financing solely to our customers in our stores. CAF allows us to manage our reliance on third-party financing providers and to leverage knowledge of our business to provide qualifying customers a competitive financing option. As a result, we believe CAF enables us to capture additional profits, cash flows and sales. After the effect of 3-day payoffs and vehicle returns, CAF financed 41 .2 % of our retail vehicle unit sales in fiscal 2015. As of February 28, 2015, CAF serviced approximately 619 ,000 customer accounts in its $ 8.46 billion portfolio of managed receivables. Management regularly analyzes CAF operating results by assessing the competitiveness of our consumer offer, profitability, the performance of the auto loan receivables including trends in credit losses and delinquencies, and CAF direct expenses. Revenues and Profitability During fiscal 2015, net sales and operating revenues increased 13.5 % , net earnings grew 21.3 % and net earnings per share increase d 26.4 %. These year-over-year comparisons benefited from the receipt of proceeds in a class action lawsuit in fiscal 2015 and a correction to our accounting related to cancellation reserves for EPP products in fiscal 2014. Excluding these items, fiscal 2015 net earnings grew 15.9% and net earnings per share increased 20.3%. Our primary source of revenue and net income is the retail sale of used vehicles. During fiscal 2015, we sold 5 82,282 used cars, representing 9 8.5 % of the total 591 , 149 vehicles we sold at retail, 8 1.8 % of our net sales and operating revenues and 67.2 % of our gross profit. Used vehicle unit sales grew 10.5%, including a 4.4% increase in comparable store used units and sales from newer stores not yet included in the comparable store base. 22 Wholesale sales are also a significant contributor to our revenues and net income. During fiscal 2015, we sold 376,186 wholesale vehicles, representing 1 4.4 % of our net sales and operating revenues and 19 .3 % of our gross profit. Wholesale vehicle unit sales grew 9.8%, reflecting improved appraisal traffic and the growth in our store base. During fiscal 2015, other sales and revenues, which include commissions earned on the sale of EPP products, service department sales and net third-party finance fees, increased 31.2%. Excluding the prior year EPP cancellation reserve correction, other sales and revenues grew 21.0%, primarily due to the growth in retail unit sales. These items represented 13.1% of our gross profit. Income from our CAF segment totaled $ 367.3 million in fiscal 2015 , up 9.3% compared with fiscal 2014 . CAF income primarily reflects the interest and fee income generated by the auto loan receivables less the interest expense associated with the debt issued to fund these receivables, a provision for estimated loan losses and direct CAF expenses. CAF income does not include any allocation of indirect costs. Liquidity Our primary ongoing sources of liquidity include funds provided by operations, proceeds from securitization transactions, and borrowings under our revolving credit facility or through other sources. During fiscal 2015, liquidity was primarily provided by $1.22 billion in net issuances of non-recourse notes payable, $627.9 million of cash and cash equivalents on hand at the start of the year, a $300 million term loan and $254.1 million of adjusted net cash provided by operations, a non-GAAP measure. This liquidity was primarily used to fund the increase in CAF auto loan receivables, the 17.5 million common shares repurchased under our share repurchase program and our store growth. In fiscal 2015, net cash used in operating activities totaled $ 968.1 million , while net cash provided by operating activities excluding the increase in se curitized auto loan receivables equaled $ 254.1 million. When considering cash provided by operating activities, management does not include increases in auto loan receivables that have been securitized with non-recourse notes payable, which are separately reflected as cash provided by financing activities. For a reconciliation of adjusted net cash provided by operations to net cash used in operating activities, the most directly comparable GAAP financial measure, see Reconciliation of Adjusted Net Cash from Operating Activities included in FINANCIAL CONDITION - Liquidity and Capital Resources. Future Outlook Over the long term, we believe the primary driver for earnings growth will be vehicle unit sales growth from both new stores and stores included in our comparable store base. We also believe that increased used vehicle unit sales will drive increased sales of wholesale vehicles and ancillary products and, over time, increased CAF income. To expand our vehicle unit sales at new and existing stores, we will need to continue delivering an unrivaled customer experience and hiring and developing the associates necessary to drive our success, while managing the risks posed by an evolving competitive environment. In addition, to support our store growth plans, we will need to continue procuring suitable real estate at favorable terms. We are still in the midst of the national rollout of our retail concept, and as of February 28, 2015, we had used car stores located in markets that comprised approximately 61% of the U.S. population. We opened 10 stores in fiscal 2013, 13 stores in fiscal 2014 and 13 stores in fiscal 2015. We currently plan to open between 13 and 16 stores in each of the next three fiscal years. In fiscal 2016, we plan to open 14 new stores and relocate one store whose lease is expiring. See Fiscal 2016 Planned Store Openings included elsewhere in MD&A for a detailed list of fiscal 2016 planned store openings. See Risk Factors, included in Part I. Item 1A of this Form 10-K for additional information about risks and uncertainties facing our Company . CRITICAL ACCOUNTING POLICIES Our results of operations and financial condition as reflected in the consolidated financial statements have been prepared in accordance with U.S. generally accepted accounting principles. Preparation of financial statements requires management to make estimates and assumptions affecting the reported amounts of assets, liabilities, revenues, expenses and the disclosures of contingent assets and liabilities. We use our historical experience and other relevant factors when developing our estimates and assumptions. We regularly evaluate these estimates and assumptions. Note 2 includes a discussion of significant accounting policies. The accounting policies discussed below are the ones we consider critical to an understanding of our consolidated financial statements because 23 their application places the most significant demands on our judgment. Our financial results might have been different if different assumptions had been used or other conditions had prevailed. Financing and Securitization Transactions We maintain a revolving securitization program composed of two warehouse facilities ( warehouse facilities ) that we use to fund auto loan receivables originated by CAF until we elect to fund them through a term securitization or alternative funding arrangement. We recognize transfers of auto loan receivables into the warehouse facilities and term securitizations as secured borrowings, which result in recording the auto loan receivables and the related non-recourse notes payable on our consolidated balance sheets. CAF income included in the consolidated statements of earnings primarily reflects the interest and fee income generated by the auto loan receivables less the interest expense associated with the debt issued to fund these receivables, a provision for estimated loan losses and direct CAF expenses . Auto loan receivables include amounts due from customers related to retail vehicle sales financed through CAF. The receivables are presented net of an allowance for estimated loan losses. The allowance for loan losses represents an estimate of the amount of net losses inherent in our portfolio of managed receivables as of the applicable reporting date and anticipated to occur during the following 12 months. The allowance is primarily based on the credit quality of the underlying receivables, historical loss trends and forecasted forward loss curves. We also take into account recent trends in delinquencies and losses, recovery rates and the economic environment. The provision for loan losses is the periodic expense of maintaining an adequate allowance. Se e Notes 2(F), 2(I) and 4 for additional inf ormation on securitizations and auto loan receivables. Revenue Recognition We recognize revenue when the earnings process is complete, generally either at the time of sale to a customer or upon delivery to a customer. As part of our customer service strategy, we guarantee the retail vehicles we sell with a 5 day, money-back guarantee. We record a reserve for estimated returns based on historical experience and trends , and results could be affected if future vehicle returns differ from historical averages. We also sell ESPs and GAP on behalf of unrelated third parties, who are the primary obligors, to customers who purchase a vehicle. The ESPs we currently offer on all used vehicles provide coverage up to 60 months (subject to mileage limitations), while GAP covers the customer for the term of their finance contract. We recognize commission revenue at the time of sale, net of a reserve for estimated contract cancellations. Periodically, we may receive additional commissions based upon the level of underwriting profits of the third parties who administer the products. These additional commissions are recognized as revenue when received. The reserve for cancellations is evaluated for each product, and is based on forecasted forward cancellation curves utilizing historical experience, recent trends and credit mix of the customer base. Our risk related to contract cancellations is limited to the commissions that we receive. Cancellations fluctuate depending on the volume of ESP and GAP sales, customer financing default or prepayment rates, and shifts in customer behavior related to changes in the coverage or term of the product. Results could be affected if actual events differ from our estimates. A 10% change in the estimated cancellation rates would have changed cancellation reserves by approximately $9.4 million as of February 28, 2015. See Note 8 for additional information on cancellation reserves. Customers applying for financing who are not approved by CAF may be evaluated by other third-party finance providers . These providers generally either pay us or are paid a fixed, pre-negotiated fee per contract. We recognize these fees at the time of sale. We collect sales taxes and other taxes from customers on behalf of governmental authorities at the time of sale. These taxes are accounted for on a net basis and are not included in net sales and operating revenues or cost of sales. Income Taxes Estimates and judgments are used in the calculation of certain tax liabilities and in the determination of the recoverability of certain deferred tax assets. In the ordinary course of business, transactions occur for which the ultimate tax outcome is uncertain at the time of the transactions. We adjust our income tax provision in the period in which we determine that it is probable that our actual results will differ from our estimates. Tax law and rate changes are reflected in the income tax provision in the period in which such changes are enacted . See Note 9 for additional information on income taxes. We evaluate the need to record valuation allowances that would reduce deferred tax assets to the amount that will more likely than not be realized. When assessing the need for valuation allowances, we consider available carrybacks, future reversals of existing temporary differences and future taxable income. Except for a valuation 24 allowance recorded for capital loss carryforwards that may not be utilized before their expiration, we believe that our recorded deferred tax assets as of February 28, 2015, will more likely than not be realized. However, if a change in circumstances results in a change in our ability to realize our deferred tax assets, our tax provision would be affected in the period when the change in circumstances occurs. In addition, the calculation of our tax liabilities involves dealing with uncertainties in the application of complex tax regulations. We recognize potential liabilities for anticipated tax audit issues in the U.S. and other tax jurisdictions based on our estimate of whether, and the extent to which, additional taxes will be due. If payments of these amounts ultimately prove to be unnecessary, the reversal of the liabilities would result in tax benefits being recognized in the period when we determine the liabilities are no longer necessary. If our estimate of tax liabilities proves to be less than the ultimate assessment, a further charge to expense would result in the period of determination.

We do not remove renovated stores from our comparable store base. Comparable store calculations include results for a set of stores that were included in our comparable store base in both the current and corresponding prior year periods. Vehicle Sales Changes Years Ended February 28 2015 2014 2013 Used vehicle units 10.5 % 17.7 % 9.7 % Used vehicle revenues 13.3 % 17.8 % 11.8 % Wholesale vehicle units 9.8 % 5.5 % 2.6 % Wholesale vehicle revenues 12.4 % 3.6 % 2.2 % Change in Used Car Store Base Years Ended February 28 2015 2014 2013 Used car stores, beginning of year 131 118 108 Store openings 13 13 10 Used car stores, end of year 144 131 118 The fiscal 2015 store openings included 10 stores in 9 new markets (1 store each in Rochester, New York; Dothan, Alabama; Spokane, Washington; Madison, Wisconsin; Lynchburg, Virginia; Tupelo, Mississippi; Reno, Nevada; and Cleveland, Ohio; and 2 stores in Portland, Oregon) and 3 stores in existing markets (Harrisburg/Lancaster, Pennsylvania; Dallas, Texas; and Raleigh, North Carolina). The Dothan, Lynchburg, and Tupelo stores are small format stores. In recent years, we have tested small format stores, which generally are located in smaller markets where the sales opportunity is below that of mid-sized and large markets. While these stores are anticipated to sell fewer vehicles compared with our stores in larger markets, they have a smaller footprint, employ fewer associates and have less overhead compared with other CarMax stores. Based on performance in our test stores, we are incorporating additional small format stores into our future store opening plans. Used Vehicle Sales Fiscal 2015 Versus Fiscal 2014. The 1 3.3 % increase in used vehicle revenues in fiscal 2015 resulted from a 10.5% increase in used unit sales and a 2.5% increase in average retail vehicle selling price . The increase in used unit sales included a 4.4 % increase in comparable store used unit sales and sales from newer stores not yet included in the comparable store base. The comparable store used unit growth reflected improved customer traffic, as well as improved conversion. Our data indicates that in our markets, we increased our share of the 0- to 10-year old used vehicle market by approximately 5% in calendar 2014. The increase in average retail vehicle selling price primarily reflected changes in our sales mix, with an increased mix of 0-to 4-year old vehicles in fiscal 2015. From 2008 through 2012, new car industry sales were at rates significantly below pre-recession levels, which affected the overall supply and acquisition costs of late-model used vehicles. As the supply of later-model used vehicles has gradually improved, our inventory mix has shifted accordingly. Fiscal 2014 Versus Fiscal 2013. The 17.8% increase in used vehicle revenues in fiscal 2014 resulted from a corresponding increase in used unit sales. The increase in unit sales included a 12.2% increase in comparable store used unit sales and sales from newer stores not yet included in the comparable store base. The comparable store used unit growth was primarily driven by improved conversion, as well as a modest increase in store traffic. We believe the 26 strong conversion reflected continued improvements in execution in our stores and an attractive credit environment experienced during fiscal 2014. Our data indicates that in our markets, we increased our share of the 0- to 10-year old used vehicle market by approximately 16 % in fiscal 2014. Wholesale Vehicle Sales Our wholesale auction prices usually reflect the trends in the general wholesale market for the types of vehicles we sell, although they can also be affected by changes in vehicle mix or the average age, mileage or condition of the vehicles bought through our appraisal process and sold in our auctions. Fiscal 2015 Versus Fiscal 2014. The 12.4 % increase in wholesale vehicle revenues in fiscal 2015 resulted from a 9.8 % increase in wholesale unit sales and a 2.2 % increase in average wholesale vehicle selling price. The wholesale unit growth reflected both an increase in the appraisal buy rate and the growth in our store base . Fiscal 2014 Versus Fiscal 2013. The 3.6% increase in wholesale vehicle revenues in fiscal 2014 resulted from a 5.5% increase in wholesale unit sales, partially offset by a 2.1% reduction in average wholesale vehicle selling price. The wholesale unit growth primarily reflected the growth in our store base, as well as an increase in the appraisal buy rate. However, we experienced a reduced mix of wholesale vehicles in our appraisal traffic that partially offset the benefit of our store growth and increased buy rate. Other Sales and Revenues Other sales and revenues include commissions on the sale of ESPs and GAP (collectively reported in EPP revenues, net of a reserve for estimated contract cancellations), service department sales and net third-party finance fees. The fixed, per-vehicle fees that we pay to the Tier 3 providers are reflected as an offset to finance fee revenues received from the Tier 2 providers . During fiscal 2014, we corrected our accounting related to cancellation reserves for ESP and GAP, with resulting increases in reserves related to activity for fiscal 2014, fiscal 2013 and fiscal 2012. The portion related to fiscal 2013 and fiscal 2012 was $19.5 million, or $0.05 per share. In the following discussions, where indicated, year-over-year comparisons exclude the portion of the correction that related to earlier fiscal years. Fiscal 2015 Versus Fiscal 2014. Excluding the prior year EPP cancellation reserve correction, other sales and revenues grew 21.0% in fiscal 2015. EPP revenue grew 11.9% excluding the prior year cancellation reserve correction , largely reflecting the increase in our retail unit sales. Net third-party finance fees improved 23.0% primarily due to a mix shift among providers, including an increase in the percentage of our retail unit sales financed by the Tier 2 providers and a reduction in the percentage financed by the Tier 3 providers. The percentage of retail vehicles financed by Tier 3 providers, combined with those financed under the previously announced CAF loan origination test, was 15.6% in fiscal 2015 compared with 18.8% in fiscal 2014. Fiscal 2014 Versus Fiscal 2013. Excluding the EPP cancellation reserve correction, ot her sales and revenues increased 1.4 % in fiscal 201 4. EPP revenue grew 12.6% excluding the cancellation reserve correction , reflecting the increase in our retail unit sales and a higher EPP penetration rate, partially offset by higher estimated cancellation reserve rates. The $26.7 million decrease in net third-party finance fees was driven by a mix shift among providers, including an increase in the percentage of our retail unit sales financed by Tier 3 providers to 1 8.8 % in fiscal 201 4 versus 1 5. 9% in fiscal 201 3 . Throughout fiscal 201 3 and for most of fiscal 201 4 , the volume and share of financing originated by the Tier 3 providers increased on a year-over-year basis, as these providers made more attractive offers to customers. In the fourth quarter of fiscal 2014, however, the Tier 3 providers moderated their credit offerings, and as a result, their share of financings for the fourth quarter was flat with fiscal 2013. 27 Gross Profit Years Ended February 28 (In millions) 2015 Change 2014 Change 2013 Used vehicle gross profit $ 1,268.5 10.9 % $ 1,143.9 17.7 % $ 971.5 New vehicle gross profit 6.0 33.8 % 4.5 (9.5) % 5.0 Wholesale vehicle gross profit 364.9 16.3 % 313.9 1.9 % 308.1 Other gross profit 248.1 33.1 % 186.5 3.7 % 179.8 Total $ 1,887.5 14.5 % $ 1,648.7 12.6 % $ 1,464.4 Gross Profit per Unit Years Ended February 28 2015 2014 2013 $ per unit (1) % (2) $ per unit (1) % (2) $ per unit (1) % (2) Used vehicle gross profit $ 2,179 10.9 $ 2,171 11.1 $ 2,170 11.1 New vehicle gross profit $ 676 2.5 $ 577 2.1 $ 630 2.4 Wholesale vehicle gross profit $ 970 17.8 $ 916 17.2 $ 949 17.5 Other gross profit $ 420 81.3 $ 349 80.2 $ 395 72.3 Total gross profit $ 3,193 13.2 $ 3,083 13.1 $ 3,214 13.4 (1) Calculated as category gross profit divided by its respective units sold, except the other and total categories, which are divided by total retail units sold. (2) Calculated as a percentage of its respective sales or revenue. Used Vehicle Gross Profit We target a dollar range of gross profit per used unit sold. The gross profit dollar target for an individual vehicle is based on a variety of factors, including its anticipated probability of sale and its mileage relative to its age; however, it is not primarily based on the vehicle selling price. Our ability to quickly adjust appraisal offers to be consistent with the broader market trade-in trends and the pace of our inventory turns reduce our exposure to the inherent continual fluctuation in used vehicle values and contribute to our ability to manage gross profit dollars per unit. We systematically mark down individual vehicle prices based on proprietary pricing algorithms in order to appropriately balance sales trends, inventory turns and gross profit achievement. Other factors that may influence gross profit include changes in our vehicle reconditioning costs, changes in the percentage of vehicles sourced directly from consumers through our appraisal process and changes in the wholesale pricing environment. Vehicles purchased directly from consumers typically generate more gross profit per unit compared with vehicles purchased at auction or through other channels. Fiscal 2015 Versus Fiscal 2014. The 10.9% increase in u sed vehicle gross profit in fiscal 2015 was driven by the corresponding increase in used unit sales. Used vehicle gross profit per unit remained consistent. Fiscal 2014 Versus Fiscal 2013. The 17.7% increase in used vehicle gross profit in fiscal 2014 was driven by the corresponding increase in used unit sales. Used vehicle gross profit per unit remained consistent. Wholesale Vehicle Gross Profit Our wholesale gross profit per unit reflects the demand for older, higher mileage vehicles, which are the mainstay of our auctions, as well as the continued strong dealer attendance and resulting high dealer-to-car ratios at our auctions. The frequency of our auctions, which are generally held weekly or bi-weekly, minimizes the depreciation risk on these vehicles. Our ability to adjust appraisal offers in response to the wholesale pricing environment is a key factor that influences wholesale gross profit. Fiscal 2015 Versus Fiscal 2014. The 16.3% increase in w holesale vehicle gross profit in fiscal 2015 reflected the combination of the 9.8 % increase in wholesale unit sales with a 5.9 % increase in wholesale gross profit per unit. 28 Fiscal 2014 Versus Fiscal 2013. The 1.9% increase in wholesale vehicle gross profit in fiscal 2014 reflected the 5.5% increase in wholesale unit sales partially offset by a 3.5% reduction in wholesale gross profit per unit. Other Gross Profit Other gross profit includes profits related to EPP revenues, net third-party finance fees and service department operations, including used vehicle reconditioning. We have no cost of sales related to EPP revenues or net third-party finance fees, as these represent commissions paid to us by certain third-party providers . Third-party finance fees are reported net of the fees we pay to third-party Tier 3 finance providers. Accordingly, changes in the relative mix of the other gross profit components can affect the composition and amount of other gross profit. The fiscal 2014 correction in accounting for EPP cancellation reserves reduced fiscal 2014 other gross profit by $19.5 million related to activity for fiscal 2013 and fiscal 2012. Fiscal 2015 Versus Fiscal 2014. Excluding the prior year EPP cancellation reserve correction, o ther gross profit increased 20.5% in fiscal 2015, consistent with the changes in other sales and revenues discussed above. Fiscal 2014 Versus Fiscal 2013. Excluding the EPP cancellation reserve correction, ot her gross profit increased 14.6 % in fiscal 201 4. This change reflected the net effects of the 12.6% increase in EPP revenues excluding the cancellation reserve correction, the $26.7 million decrease in net third-party finance fees and higher service department gross profits. The $27.3 million increase in fiscal 2014 service department gross profit primarily reflected increases in gross profit associated with used vehicle reconditioning, which benefited from strong used unit sales growth and the resulting leverage of service overhead costs. Impact of Inflation Historically, inflation has not had a significant impact on results. Profitability is primarily affected by our ability to achieve targeted unit sales and gross profit dollars per vehicle rather than by changes in average retail prices. However, increases in average vehicle selling prices benefit CAF income, to the extent the average amount financed also increases. In the years following the recession, we experienced a period of appreciation in used vehicle wholesale pricing. We believe the appreciation resulted, in part, from a reduced supply of late-model used vehicles in the market . This reduced supply was caused by the dramatic decline in new car industry sales and the associated slow down in used vehicle trade-in activity, compared with pre-recession periods. The higher wholesale values increased both our vehicle acquisition costs and our used vehicle average selling prices , which climbed from $16,291 in fiscal 2009 to $19, 897 in fiscal 2015. Selling, General and Administrative Expenses Components of SG&A Expense Years Ended February 28 (In millions except per unit data) 2015 Change 2014 Change 2013 Compensation and benefits (1) $ 730.4 11.2 % $ 656.7 12.9 % $ 581.9 Store occupancy costs 243.5 12.3 216.8 8.5 199.9 Advertising expense 122.8 9.4 112.2 5.6 106.3 Other overhead costs (2) 161.0 (5.0) 169.5 18.6 142.9 Total SG&A expenses $ 1,257.7 8.9 % $ 1,155.2 12.0 % $ 1,031.0 SG&A per retail unit $ 2,128 $ (33) $ 2,161 $ (102) $ 2,263 (1) Excludes compensation and benefits related to reconditioning and vehicle repair service, which are included in cost of sales. (2) Includes IT expenses, insurance, non-CAF bad debt, travel, preopening and relocation costs, charitable contributions and other administrative expenses. Costs for fiscal 2015 were reduced by $20.9 million in connection with the receipt of settlement proceeds in a class action lawsuit. Fiscal 2015 Versus Fiscal 2014 . SG&A expenses for fiscal 2015 were reduced by $20.9 million, or $0.06 per share, which represented our receipt of settlement proceeds in a class action lawsuit related to the economic loss 29 associated with certain Toyota vehicles. Excluding this gain, SG&A expenses grew 10.7% in fiscal 2015. This increase reflected the combination of several factors, including the 10 % increase in our store base during fiscal 201 5 (representing the addition of 13 stores) , higher variable selling costs resulting from the 4.4% increase in comparable store used unit sales , and an $11.5 million increase in share-based compensation expense, which was influenced by the 39% increase in the per share price of our common stock from February 28, 2014 to February 28, 2015. Excluding the settlement gain, SG&A per retail unit was $2,163 in fiscal 2015, similar to the fiscal 201 4 level . F iscal 2014 Versus Fiscal 2013. T he 12.0% increase in SG&A expense in fiscal 2014 reflected the 11 % increase in our store base (representing the addition of 1 3 stores) and higher variable selling costs resulting from the 12.2 % increase in comparable store used unit sales. SG&A costs were also affected by the increase in the rate of our store openings, from 10 stores in fiscal 2013 to 13 stores in fiscal 2014. SG&A per retail unit declined as our comparable store used unit sales growth generated overhead leverage . Interest Expense Fiscal 2015 Versus Fiscal 2014 . Interest expense declined to $24.5 million in fiscal 2015 versus $30.8 million in fiscal 2014. During fiscal 2015, we capitalized $8.9 million in interest costs associated with construction costs of certain facilities. Excluding the capitalized interest costs, the year-over-year increase in interest expense primarily reflected interest expense on a $300 million term loan entered into in November 2014. Fiscal 2014 Versus Fiscal 2013 . Interest expense declined to $30.8 million in fiscal 2014 versus $32.4 million in fiscal 2013. In both years, the interest related primarily to our outstanding finance and capital lease obligations. Income Taxes The effective income tax rate was 38.4 % in fiscal 2015, 38.2% in fiscal 2014 and 38.1% in fiscal 2013 . RESULTS OF OPERATIONS CARMAX AUTO FINANCE CAF income primarily reflects interest and fee income generated by CAF portfolio of auto loan receivables less the interest expense associated with the debt issued to fund these receivables, a provision for estimated loan losses and direct CAF expense s. CAF income does not include any allocation of indirect costs. Although CAF benefits from certain indirect overhead expenditures, we have not allocated indirect costs to CAF to avoid making subjective allocation decisions. Examples of indirect costs not allocated to CAF include retail store expenses and corporate expenses such as human resources, administrative services, marketing, information systems, accounting, legal, treasury and executive payroll. CAF managed portfolio is composed primarily of loans originated over the past several years. Trends in receivable growth and interest margins primarily reflect the cumulative effect of changes in the business over a multi-year period. Trends in portfolio losses and delinquencies are affected by changes in our origination strategies over time, as well as current economic conditions. Current period originations reflect current trends in both our retail sales and the CAF business, including the volume of loans originated, current interest rates charged to consumers, loan terms and average credit scores. Because we recognize CAF income over the life of the underlying auto loan, loans originated in a given fiscal period generally do not have a significant effect on that period financial results. See Note 3 for additional information on CAF income and Note 4 for information on auto loan receivables, including credit quality. 30 Components of CAF Income Years Ended February 28 (In millions) 2015 % (1) 2014 % (1) 2013 % (1) Interest margin: Interest and fee income $ 604.9 7.7 $ 548.0 8.3 $ 495.3 9.2 Interest expense (96.6) (1.2) (90.0) (1.4) (95.1) (1.8) Total interest margin 508.3 6.5 458.0 6.9 400.2 7.4 Provision for loan losses (82.3) (1.0) (72.2) (1.1) (56.2) (1.0) Total interest margin after provision for loan losses 426.0 5.4 385.8 5.8 344.0 6.4 Other income 0.1 Total direct expenses (58.7) (0.7) (49.7) (0.8) (44.7) (0.8) CarMax Auto Finance income $ 367.3 4.7 $ 336.2 5.1 $ 299.3 5.6 Total average managed receivables $ 7,859.9 $ 6,629.5 $ 5,385.5 (1) Percent of total average managed receivables . Fiscal 2015 Versus Fiscal 2014 . The 9.3% increase in CAF income resulted from the growth in CAF average managed receivables, partially offset by a lower total interest margin as a percent of average managed receivables . Average managed receivables grew 18.6% to $7.86 billion in fiscal 2015. Total interest margin, which reflects the spread between interest and fees charged to consumers and our funding costs, declined as a percentage of total average managed receivables to 6.5% in fiscal 2015 from 6.9% in fiscal 2014. This reflected the combination of (i) a gradual decline in the average contract rate charged on new loan originations in recent years with (ii) an increase in our average funding costs for more recent securitizations. Changes in the interest margin on new originations affect CAF income over time as these loans come to represent an increasing percentage of managed receivables. Rising interest rates, which affect CAF funding costs, or further competitive pressures on consumer rates could result in further compression in the interest margin on new originations. Fiscal 2014 Versus Fiscal 2013 . The 12.3% increase in CAF income resulted from the growth in CAF managed receivables, partially offset by a lower total interest margin rate. Average managed receivables grew 23.1% to $6.63 billion in fiscal 2014. Total interest margin declined to 6.9% in fiscal 2014 from 7.4% in fiscal 2013. A strategic decision made in mid-fiscal 2013 to provide more competitive finance offers contributed to both the decline in the weighted average contract rate on loan originations to 7.0% in fiscal 2014 from 7.9% in fiscal 2013, and to the decline in total interest margin. 31 CAF O rigination I nformation Years Ended February 28 (1) 2015 2014 2013 Net loans originated (in millions) $ 4,727.8 $ 4,183.9 $ 3,445.3 Vehicle units financed 243,264 218,706 179,525 Penetration rate (2) 41.2 % 40.9 % 39.4 % Weighted average contract rate 7.1 % 7.0 % 7.9 % Weighted average credit score (3) 701 702 696 Weighted average loan-to-value (LTV) (4) 94.2 93.7 94.8 Weighted average term (in months) 65.4 65.4 65.9 (1) All information relates to loans originated net of 3-day payoffs and vehicle returns. (2) Vehicle units financed as a percentage of total retail units sold. (3) The credit scores represent FICO scores, and reflect only receivables with obligors that have a FICO score at the time of application. The FICO score with respect to any receivable with co-obligors is calculated as the average of each obligor FICO score at the time of application. FICO scores are not a significant factor in our primary scoring model which relies on information from credit bureaus and other application information as discussed in Note 4. FICO is a federally registered servicemark of Fair Isaac Corporation. (4) LTV represents the ratio of the amount financed to the total collateral value, which is measured as the vehicle selling price plus applicable taxes, title and fees. Net loans originated in fiscal 2015 increased 13.0%, primarily reflecting the 13.3% growth in our retail vehicle revenues. The increase in CAF penetration rate in fiscal 2015 included the effect of an increase in loans originated in the CAF loan origination test. Net loans originated in fiscal 2014 increased 21.4%, reflecting both the 17.5% growth in our retail vehicle revenues and an increase in CAF penetration rate, which benefited from favorable responses to the change in our credit offers. Loan Origination Test. In January 2014, CAF launched a test originating loans for customers who typically would be financed by our Tier 3 finance providers. Through February 28, 2015, net loans originated in this test totaled $72.2 million, of which $63.1 million were originated in fiscal 2015. Because the loans in this test have higher loss and delinquency rates than the aggregate of the current CAF portfolio, they also have higher contract rates. The test is being funded separately from the remainder of CAF portfolio and is not included in our current securitization program. We currently plan to extend this test at a similar rate of originations while continuing to evaluate the performance of these loans. Allowance for Loan Losses Years Ended February 28 (In millions) 2015 % (1) 2014 % (1) Balance as of beginning of year $ 69.9 0.97 $ 57.3 0.97 Charge-offs (155.9) (134.3) Recoveries 85.4 74.7 Provision for loan losses 82.3 72.2 Balance as of end of year $ 81.7 0.97 $ 69.9 0.97 (1) Percent of total ending managed receivables. The allowance for loan losses represents an estimate of the amount of net losses inherent in our portfolio of managed receivables as of the applicable reporting date and anticipated to occur during the following 12 months. The 16.9% increase in the dollar amount of the allowance for loan losses as of February 28, 2015 compared with a year earlier largely reflected the growth in managed receivables. The allowance for loan losses as a percent of managed receivables remained consistent as of February 28, 2015, and February 28, 2014. 32 Loan Performance Information Years Ended February 28 (In millions) 2015 2014 2013 Net credit losses on managed receivables $ 70.5 $ 59.6 $ 42.2 Total average managed receivables $ 7,859.9 $ 6,629.5 $ 5,385.5 Net credit losses as a percentage of total average managed receivables 0.90 % 0.90 % 0.78 % Total ending managed receivables $ 8,458.7 $ 7,184.4 $ 5,933.3 Past due accounts as a percentage of ending managed receivables 2.62 % 2.58 % 2.60 % Average recovery rate 54.2 % 55.2 % 58.4 % The average recovery rate represents the average percentage of the outstanding principal balance we receive when a vehicle is repossessed and liquidated, generally at our wholesale auctions. The annual recovery rate has ranged from a low of 42% to a high of 60%, and it is primarily affected by changes in the wholesale market pricing environment. PLANNED FUTURE ACTIVITIES We plan to open between 13 and 16 stores in each of the next three fiscal years. In fiscal 2016, we plan to open 14 new stores and relocate one store whose lease is expiring. In fiscal 2016, we also plan to remodel approximately 15 older stores. We currently estimate capital expenditures will total approximately $360 million in fiscal 2016.

RECENT ACCOUNTING PRONOUNCEMENTS See Note 2( Y ) f or information on recent accounting pronouncements applicable to CarMax . 33 FINANCIAL CONDITION Liquidity and Capital Resources Our primary ongoing cash requirements are to fund our existing operations, store expansion and improvement (including capital expenditures and inventory purchases) and CAF. Since fiscal 2013, we have also elected to use cash for our share repurchase program. As a result of these activities, over the last two fiscal years, we have reduced the cash and cash equivalents we hold and, during fiscal 2015, increased our borrowings. Our primary ongoing sources of liquidity include funds provided by operations, proceeds from securitization transactions or other funding arrangements, and borrowings under our revolving credit facility or through other sources . Operating Activities . Net cash used in operating activities of $968.1 million includes increases in auto loan receivables of $1.37 billion in fiscal 2015. The majority of the increases in auto loan receivables are accompanied by increases in non-recourse notes payable, which are separately reflected as cash provided by financing activities. When considering cash provided by operating activities, management uses an adjusted measure of net cash from operating activities that offsets the changes in auto loan receivables with the corresponding changes in non-recourse notes payable. This is achieved by adding back the net cash provided from the issuance of non-recourse notes payable, which represents the increase in auto loan receivables that were securitized through the issuance of non-recourse notes payable during the period. The resulting financial measure, adjusted net cash from operating activities, is a non-GAAP financial measure. We believe adjusted net cash from operating activities is a meaningful metric for investors because it provides better visibility into the cash generated from operations. Including the increases in non-recourse notes payable, net cash provided by operating activities would have been as follows: Reconciliation of Adjusted Net Cash from Operating Activities Years Ended February 28 (In millions) 2015 2014 2013 Net cash used in operating activities $ (968.1) $ (613.2) $ (778.4) Add: Net issuance of non-recourse notes payable (1) 1,222.2 1,393.4 1,171.0 Adjusted net cash provided by operating activities $ 254.1 $ 780.2 $ 392.6 (1) Calculated using the gross issuances less payments on non-recourse notes payable as disclosed on the consolidated statement s of cash flows. As of February 28, 2015, total inventory was $ 2.09 billion, representing an increase of $ 445.5 million, or 27.1 %, compared with the balance as of the start of the fiscal year. The increase reflected a combination of factors, including an intentional build in inventories in the fall and winter of 2014 to better position us for seasonal sales opportunities, the 13 new stores opened during fiscal 2015, added inventories to support our comparable store sales growth, and below-target inventories at the start of the fiscal year. As of February 28, 2014, total inventory was $1.64 billion, representing an increase of $123.6 million, or 8 .1 %, compared with the balance as of the start of the fiscal year. The increase reflected the 13 stores opened during fiscal 2014, as well as added inventories to support our comparable store sales growth. Inventory levels were below target levels as of the end of fiscal 2014, due to disruptions in reconditioning activities caused by unusually severe weather experienced during the fourth quarter of th at fiscal year. Investing Activities . Net cash used in investing activities totaled $360.7 million in fiscal 2015, $336.7 million in fiscal 2014 and $255.3 million in fiscal 2013. Investing activities primarily consist of capital expenditures, which totaled $309.8 million in fiscal 2015, $310.3 million in fiscal 2014 and $235.7 million in fiscal 2013. Capital expenditures primarily include real estate acquisitions for planned future store openings , store construction costs and store remodeling expenses . We maintain a multi-year pipeline of sites to support our store growth, so portions of capital spending in one year may relate to stores that we open in subsequent fiscal years. We opened 13 stores in fiscal 2015, 13 stores in fiscal 2014 and 10 stores in fiscal 2013. As of February 28, 201 5 , we owned 87 and leased 57 of our 1 44 used car stores. Financing Activities . Net cash provided by financing activities totaled $728.6 million in fiscal 2015, $1.13 billion in fiscal 2014 and $1.04 billion in fiscal 2013. Included in these amounts were net increases in total non-recourse notes payable of $1.22 billion, $1.39 billion and $1.17 billion, respectively, which were used to provide the financing for the majority of the increases of $1.37 billion, $1.32 billion and $992.2 million, respectively, in auto 34 loan receivables (see Operating Activities). During fiscal 2015, we received proceeds of $300 million from a floating rate term loan entered into in November 2014. N et cash provided by financing activities was reduced by stock repurchases of $917.0 million in fiscal 2015, $307.2 million in fiscal 2014 and $203.4 million in fiscal 2013 . Total Debt and Cash and Cash Equivalents As of February 28 (In thousands) 2015 2014 Borrowings under revolving credit facility $ 10,785 $ 582 Other long-term debt 300,000 Finance and capital lease obligations 327,838 334,384 Non-recourse notes payable 8,470,629 7,248,444 Total debt $ 9,109,252 $ 7,583,410 Cash and cash equivalents $ 27,606 $ 627,901 We have a $1.0 billion unsecured revolving credit facility, which expires in August 2016. The borrowing capacity under this credit facility was increased by $300 million during fiscal 2015. Borrowings under this facility are available for working capital and general corporate purposes, and the unused portion is fully available to us. See Note 11 for additional information on the revolving credit facility. In November 2014, we entered into a $300 million floating rate term loan, due November 2017. See Note 11 for additional information on the term loan. The credit facility and term loan agreements contain representations and warranties, conditions and covenants. If these requirements were not met, all amounts outstanding or otherwise owed could become due and payable immediately and other limitations could be placed on our ability to use any available borrowing capacity. CAF auto loan receivables are primarily funded through securitization transactions. Our securitizations are structured to legally isolate the auto loan receivables, and we would not expect to be able to access the assets of our securitization vehicles , even in insolvency, receivership or conservatorship proceedings. Similarly, the investors in the non-recourse notes payable have no recourse to our assets beyond the securitized receivables, the amounts on deposit in reserve accounts and the restricted cash from collections on auto loan receivables . We do, however, continue to have the rights associated with the interest we retain in these securitization vehicles . Loans originated in the previously announced CAF loan origination test are being funded using existing working capital, and are not included in our current securitization program. The timing of principal payments on the non-recourse notes payable is based on principal collections, net of losses, on the securitized auto loan receivables. The current portion of non-recourse notes payable represents principal payments that are due to be distributed in the following period. As of February 28, 2015 , $7.48 billion of non-recourse notes payable was outstanding related to term securitizations. Thes e notes payable accrue interest predominantly at fixed rates and have scheduled maturities through September 2021 , but they may mature earlier , depending on the repayment rate of the underlying auto loan receivables. During fiscal 2015, we completed four term securitizations, funding a total of $4.15 billion of auto loan receivables. As of February 28, 2015 , $986.0 million of non-recourse notes payable was outstanding related to our warehouse facilities. We have periodically increased our warehouse facility limit over time, as our store base, sales and CAF loan originations have grown. During fiscal 2015, we increased the combined limit of our warehouse facilities by an additional $500 million. As of February 28, 2015, the combined warehouse facility limit was $2.3 billion, and unused warehouse capacity totaled $1.31 billion . Of the combined warehouse facility limit, $800 million will expire in July 2015 and $1.5 billion will expire in February 2016. The return requirements of the warehouse facility investors could fluctuate significantly depending on market conditions. At renewal, the cost, structure and capacity of the facilities could change. These changes could have a significant effect on our funding costs. See Notes 2(F) and 11 for additional information on the warehouse facilities. The securitization agreements related to the warehouse facilities include various representations and warranties, covenants and performance triggers. If these requirements are not met, we could be unable to continue to securitize 35 receivables through the warehouse facilities. In addition, warehouse facility investors could charge us a higher rate of interest and could have us replaced as servicer. Further, we could be required to deposit collections on the securitized receivables with the warehouse facility agents on a daily basis and deliver executed lockbox agreements to the warehouse facility agents. We expect that adjusted net cash provided by operations and other funding arrangements, sale-leaseback transactions and borrowings under existing, new or expanded credit facilities will be sufficient to fund CAF, capital expenditures, repurchase of stock and working capital for the foreseeable future. We anticipate that we will be able to enter into new, or renew or expand existing , funding arrangements to meet our future funding needs. However, based on conditions in the credit markets, the cost for these arrangements could be materially higher than historical levels and the timing and capacity of these transactions could be dictated by market availability rather than our requirements. Beginning i n fiscal 2013, our board of directors authorized the repurchase of our common stock. Purchases may be made in open market or privately negotiated transactions at management discretion, and the timing and amount of repurchases are determined based on share price, market conditions, legal requirements and other factors. Shares repurchased are deemed authorized but unissued shares of common stock. As of February 28, 2015, the board had authorized a total of $3.8 billion of repurchases, including $3.0 billion authorized in fiscal 2015. As of February 28, 2015, $2.37 billion was available for repurchase under the authorizations, of which $369.3 million expires on December 31, 2015 , and $2.0 billion expires on December 31, 2016. See Note 1 2 for more information on share repurchase activity. Fair Value Measurements. We report money market securities, mutual fund investments and derivative instruments at fair value.

The securitized receivables can only be used as collateral to settle obligations of these securitization vehicles. In addition, the investors in the non-recourse notes payable have no recourse to our assets beyond the securitized receivables, the amounts on deposit in reserve accounts and the restricted cash from collections on auto loan receivables. See Note 2(F). (2) Due to the uncertainty of forecasting expected variable interest rate payments, those amounts are not included in the table. See Note 11.
