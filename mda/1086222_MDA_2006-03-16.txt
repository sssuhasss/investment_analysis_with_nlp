Item 7. Management Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations Overview We primarily derive income from the sale of services to customers executing contracts with terms of one year or longer, which we refer to as recurring revenue contracts or long-term contracts. These contracts generally commit the customer to a minimum monthly level of usage with additional charges applicable for actual usage above the monthly minimum. Having a consistent and predictable base level of income is important to our financial success. Accordingly, to be successful, we must maintain our base of recurring revenue contracts by eliminating or reducing lost monthly recurring revenue due to customer cancellations or terminations and build on that base by adding new customers and increasing the number of services, features and functions our customers purchase. At the same time, we must ensure that our expenses do not increase faster than, or at the same rate as, our revenues. Accomplishing these goals requires that we compete effectively in the marketplace on the basis of price, quality and the attractiveness of our services and technology. This Management Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations should be read in conjunction with our consolidated financial statements and notes thereto which appear elsewhere in this Annual Report on Form 10-K. See Risk Factors elsewhere in this Annual Report on Form 10-K for a discussion of certain risks associated with our business. Our improved financial results in 2005 as compared to 2004 and 2003 reflect our efforts to increase our monthly recurring revenues while reducing the expenses needed to support such growth. The following sets forth, as a percentage of revenues, consolidated statements of operations data for the years indicated: 2005 2004 2003 Revenues 100 % 100 % 100 % Cost of revenues 20 22 38 Research and development 6 6 8 Sales and marketing 28 27 30 General and administrative 19 22 35 Amortization of other intangible assets 2 1 Restructuring (benefits) (5 ) Total costs and operating expenses 75 77 107 Income (loss) from operations 25 23 (7 ) Interest income 2 1 1 Interest expense (2 ) (5 ) (12 ) Other (expense) income, net 1 (Loss) gain on investments, net 1 Loss on early extinguishment of debt (3 ) (1 ) Income (loss) before (benefit) provision for income taxes 25 17 (18 ) (Benefit) provision for income taxes (91 ) 1 Net income (loss) 116 % 16 % (18 )% We were profitable for fiscal years 2005 and 2004; however, we cannot guarantee continued profitability for any period in the future. We have observed the following trends and events that are likely to have an impact on our financial condition and results of operations in the foreseeable future: During each quarter in 2005 and 2004, the dollar volume of new recurring revenue contracts exceeded the dollar volume of the contracts we lost through cancellations, terminations and non- payment. A continuation of this trend would lead to increased revenues in the future. During 2005, no customer accounted for 10% or more of our total revenues. We expect that customer concentration levels will decline compared to prior years as our customer base continues to grow. 17 Table of Contents During 2005, revenues derived from customers located outside the United States were 21% of our total revenues. We expect that the revenues from such customers as a percentage of our total revenues in 2006 will be consistent with that of 2005. During 2005, we continued to reduce our network bandwidth costs per unit by entering into new supplier contracts with lower pricing and amending existing contracts to take advantage of price reductions offered by our existing suppliers. However, due to increased traffic delivered over our network, our total bandwidth costs increased during 2005. We believe that our overall bandwidth costs will continue to increase as a result of expected higher traffic levels, partially offset by continued reductions in bandwidth costs per unit. If we do not experience lower per unit bandwidth pricing and we are unsuccessful at effectively routing traffic over our network through lower cost providers, network bandwidth costs could increase in excess of our expectations in 2006. Depreciation expense related to our network equipment increased in 2005 as compared to 2004. Due to additional equipment purchases in 2005, expected additional purchases in 2006, as well as equipment acquired with the acquisition of Speedera, we believe that depreciation expense related to our network equipment will continue to increase in 2006. We expect to continue to enhance and add functionality to our service offerings, which will increase the amount of capitalized internal-use software costs. As a result, we believe that the amortization of internal-use software development costs, which we include in cost of revenues, will slightly increase in 2006. Equity-based compensation expense increased during 2005 as compared to 2004 in connection with the acquisition of Speedera and the issuance of deferred stock units to members of our Board of Directors in 2005. Statement of Financial Accounting Standards, or SFAS, No. 123R, Share-Based Payment (revised 2004), which will be applicable to us beginning in the first quarter of 2006, will require us to record compensation expense for employee equity awards at fair value at the time of grant. We anticipate a further increase in our non-cash equity-based compensation expense, likely resulting in a significant decrease in our expected net income in the future, because we have a significant number of unvested employee options outstanding and plan to continue to grant equity-based compensation in the future. During 2005, we released substantially all of our United States and foreign deferred tax asset valuation allowance. Based upon our cumulative operating results and an assessment of our expected future results, we determined that it was more likely than not that our deferred tax assets will be realized. During 2005, the total valuation allowance release recorded as an income tax benefit in our statement of operations was $285.8 million. We expect our annualized effective tax rate in the future to significantly increase. We expect that our consolidated annualized effective tax rate in 2006 will be approximately 40%. Based on our analysis of these known trends and events, we expect to continue to generate net income on a quarterly basis during 2006; however, our future results will be affected by many factors identified below and in the section of this report entitled Risk Factors, including our ability to: increase our revenue by adding customers through long-term contracts and limiting customer cancellations and terminations; maintain the prices we charge for our services; prevent disruptions to our services and network due to accidents or intentional attacks; and maintain our network bandwidth costs and other operating expenses consistent with our revenues. As a result, there is no assurance that we will achieve our expected financial objectives, including positive net income. Application of Critical Accounting Policies and Estimates Overview Our discussion and analysis of our financial condition and results of operations are based upon our consolidated financial statements, which have been prepared in accordance with accounting principles generally 18 Table of Contents accepted in the United States of America. These principles require us to make estimates and judgments that affect the reported amounts of assets, liabilities, revenues and expenses, cash flow and related disclosure of contingent assets and liabilities. Our estimates include those related to revenue recognition, accounts receivable reserves, capitalized internal-use software costs, intangible assets and goodwill, income and other taxes, useful lives of property and equipment, restructuring accruals and contingent obligations. We base our estimates on historical experience and on various other assumptions that we believe to be reasonable under the circumstances. Actual results may differ from these estimates. For a complete description of our significant accounting policies, see Note 2 to our consolidated financial statements included in this annual report on Form 10-K. Definitions We define our critical accounting policies as those accounting principles generally accepted in the United States of America that require us to make subjective estimates about matters that are uncertain and are likely to have a material impact on our financial condition and results of operations as well as the specific manner in which we apply those principles. Our estimates are based upon assumptions and judgments about matters that are highly uncertain at the time the accounting estimate is made and applied and require us to continually assess a range of potential outcomes. Review of Critical Accounting Policies and Estimates Revenue Recognition: We recognize service revenues in accordance with the Securities and Exchange Commission Staff Accounting Bulletin No. 104, Revenue Recognition, and the Financial Accounting Standards Board s, or FASB, Emerging Issues Task Force Issue No. 00-21, Revenue Arrangements with Multiple Deliverables. Revenue is recognized only when the price is fixed or determinable, persuasive evidence of an arrangement exists, the service is performed and collectibility of the resulting receivable is reasonably assured. At the inception of a customer contract for service, we make an estimate as to that customer ability to pay for the services provided. We base our estimate on a combination of factors, including the successful completion of a credit check or financial review, our payment history with the customer and other forms of payment assurance. Upon the completion of these steps, we recognize revenue monthly in accordance with our revenue recognition policy. If we subsequently determine that collection from the customer is not reasonably assured, we record an allowance for doubtful accounts and bad debt expense for all of that customer unpaid invoices and cease recognizing revenue for continued services provided until cash is received. Changes in our estimates and judgments about whether collection is reasonably assured would change the timing of revenue or amount of bad debt expense that we recognize. We primarily derive income from the sale of services to customers executing contracts with terms of one year or longer. These contracts generally commit the customer to a minimum monthly level of usage and provide the rate at which the customer must pay for actual usage above the monthly minimum. For these services, we recognize the monthly minimum as revenue each month provided that an enforceable contract has been signed by both parties, the service has been delivered to the customer, the fee for the service is fixed or determinable and collection is reasonably assured. Should a customer usage of our service exceed the monthly minimum, we recognize revenue for such excess usage in the period of the usage. We typically charge the customer an installation fee when the services are first activated. The installation fees are recorded as deferred revenue and recognized as revenue ratably over the estimated life of the customer arrangement. We also derive income from services sold as discrete, non-recurring events or based solely on usage. For these services, we recognize revenue after an enforceable contract has been signed by both parties, the fee is fixed or determinable, the event or usage has occurred and collection is reasonably assured. We periodically enter into multi-element service arrangements. When we enter into such arrangements, each element is accounted for separately over its respective service period, provided that there is objective evidence of fair value for the separate elements. For example, objective evidence of fair value would include the price charged for the element when sold separately. If the fair value of each element cannot be objectively determined, the total value of the arrangement is recognized ratably over the entire service period to the extent that all services have begun to be provided at the outset of the period. For most multi-element service arrangements to date, the fair value 19 Table of Contents of each element has not been objectively determinable. Therefore, all revenue under these arrangements has been recognized ratably over the related service period. We also license software under perpetual and term license agreements. We apply the provisions of Statement of Position, or SOP, 97-2, Software Revenue Recognition, as amended by SOP 98-9, Modifications of SOP 97-2, Software Revenue Recognition, With Respect to Certain Transactions. As prescribed by this guidance, we apply the residual method of accounting. The residual method requires that the portion of the total arrangement fee attributable to undelivered elements, as indicated by vendor specific objective evidence of fair value, is deferred and subsequently recognized when delivered. The difference between the total arrangement fee and the amount deferred for the undelivered elements is recognized as revenue related to the delivered elements, if all other revenue recognition criteria of SOP 97-2 are met. We also sell our services through a reseller channel. Assuming all other revenue recognition criteria are met, we recognize revenue from reseller arrangements based on the reseller contracted non-refundable minimum purchase commitments over the term of the contract, plus amounts sold by the reseller to its customers in excess of the minimum commitments. These excess commitments are recognized as revenue in the period in which the service is provided. We recognize revenue from fixed-fee arrangements and software arrangements that require significant customization or modification using the percentage-of-completion method in accordance with Accounting Research Bulletin, or ARB, No. 45, Long-Term Construction-Type Contracts, and with the applicable guidance provided by SOP 81-1, Accounting for Performance of Construction-Type and Certain Production-Type Contracts. We generally recognize revenue under these arrangements based on the percentage of cost incurred to date compared to the estimated total cost to complete the project. In certain customer arrangements, we recognize revenue based on the progress made towards achieving milestones under the contract. The impact of any change in estimate is recorded prospectively from the date of the change. At the outset of a fixed-fee arrangement, if we are not able to estimate the total cost-to-complete, nor able to measure progress towards the achievement of contract milestones, we account for the arrangement using the completed-contract method of accounting. Under this method, we recognize revenue when the contract is complete and there are no remaining costs or deliverables. In the event that the estimated total cost on a fixed-fee contract indicates a loss, we will record the loss immediately. From time to time, we enter into contracts to sell our services or license our technology to unrelated companies at or about the same time we enter into contracts to purchase products or services from the same companies. If we conclude that these contracts were negotiated concurrently, we record as revenue only the net cash received from the vendor, unless both the fair values of our services delivered to the customer and of the vendor product or service we receive can be established objectively and realization of such value is believed to be probable. We may from time to time resell licenses or services of third parties. We record revenue for these transactions when we have risk of loss related to the amounts purchased from the third party and we add value to the license or service, such as by providing maintenance or support for such license or service. If these conditions are present, we recognize revenue when all other revenue recognition criteria are satisfied. Deferred revenue includes amounts billed to customers for which revenue has not been recognized. Deferred revenue primarily consists of the unearned portion of monthly billed service fees; deferred installation and activation set-up fees; amounts billed under extended payment terms; and maintenance and support fees charged under license arrangements. Accounts Receivable and Related Reserves: Trade accounts receivable are recorded at the invoiced amounts and do not bear interest. In addition to trade accounts receivable, our accounts receivable balance includes unbilled accounts that represent revenue recorded for customers that is typically billed within one month. We record reserves against our accounts receivable balance. These reserves consist of allowances for doubtful accounts, cash basis customers and service credits. Increases and decreases in the allowance for doubtful accounts are included as a component of general and administrative expenses. The reserve for cash basis customers increases as services are provided to customers where collection is no longer assured. The reserve decreases and revenue is recognized when and if cash payments are received. The 20 Table of Contents reserve for service credits increases as a result of specific service credits that are expected to be issued to customers during the ordinary course of business, as well as for billing disputes. These credits result in a reduction to revenues. Decreases to the reserve are the result of actual credits being issued to customers, causing a corresponding reduction in accounts receivable. Estimates are used in determining these reserves and are based upon our review of outstanding balances on a customer-specific, account-by-account basis. The allowance for doubtful accounts is based upon a review of customer receivables from prior sales with collection issues where we no longer believe that the customer has the ability to pay for prior services provided. We perform on-going credit evaluations of our customers. If such an evaluation indicates that payment is no longer reasonably assured for current services provided, any future services provided to that customer will result in creation of a reserve until we receive consistent payments. In addition, we reserve a portion of revenues as a reserve for service credits. Reserves for service credits are measured based on an analysis of revenue credits to be issued after the month of billing and an estimate for future credits. These credits typically relate to management estimate of the resolution of customer disputes and billing adjustments. We do not have any off-balance sheet credit exposure related to our customers. Impairment and Useful Lives of Long-Lived Assets: We review our long-lived assets, such as fixed assets and intangible assets, for impairment whenever events or changes in circumstances indicate that the carrying amount of the assets may not be recoverable. Events that would trigger an impairment review include a change in the use of the asset or forecasted negative cash flows related to the asset. When such a triggering event occurs, we compare the carrying amount of the long-lived asset to the undiscounted expected future cash flows related to the asset. If the carrying amount is greater than the sum of the undiscounted cash flows, we adjust the asset to its fair value through an impairment charge included in loss from operations. We determine fair value based upon a quoted market price or a discounted cash flow analysis. The estimates required to apply this accounting policy include forecasted usage of the long-lived assets and the useful lives of these assets and expected future cash flows. Changes in these estimates could materially impact results from operations. Restructuring Liabilities Related to Facility Leases: When we vacate a facility subject to a non-cancelable long-term lease, we record a restructuring liability for either the estimated costs to terminate the lease or the estimated costs that will continue to be incurred under the lease for its remaining term where there is no economic benefit to us. In the latter case, we measure the amount of the restructuring liability as the amount of contractual future lease payments reduced by an estimate of sublease income. To date, we have recorded a restructuring liability when our management approves and commits us to a plan to terminate a lease, the plan specifically identifies the actions to be taken, and the actions are scheduled to begin soon after management approves the plan. In accordance with SFAS No. 146, Accounting for Costs Associated with Exit or Disposal Activities, we record restructuring liabilities, discounted at the appropriate rate, for a facility lease only when we have both vacated the space and completed all actions needed to make the space readily available for sublease. As of December 31, 2005, we had $2.3 million in accrued restructuring liabilities related to vacated facilities. In 2003, we were able to renegotiate two of our previously restructured facility leases to reduce rents payable under the leases to current market rates, resulting in a reversal of previously recorded restructuring liabilities of $9.6 million. We expect that approximately $1.4 million of the amount accrued as of December 31, 2005 will be paid within 12 months. Loss Contingencies: We define a loss contingency as a condition involving uncertainty as to a possible loss related to a previous event that will not be resolved until one or more future events occur or fail to occur. Our primary loss contingencies relate to pending or threatened litigation. We record a liability for a loss contingency when we believe that it is probable that a loss has been incurred and the amount of the loss can be reasonably estimated. When we believe the 21 Table of Contents likelihood of a loss is less than probable and more than remote, we do not record a liability but we disclose material loss contingencies in the notes to the consolidated financial statements. Tax Reserves: Our provision for income taxes is comprised of a current and a deferred portion. The current income tax provision is calculated as the estimated taxes payable or refundable on tax returns for the current year. The deferred income tax provision is calculated for the estimated future tax effects attributable to temporary differences and carryforwards using expected tax rates in effect in the years during which the differences are expected to reverse. We currently have significant deferred tax assets resulting from net operating loss carryforwards, tax credit carryforwards and deductible temporary differences. Management weighs the positive and negative evidence to determine if it is more likely than not that some or all of the deferred tax assets will be realized. In the third quarter of 2005, management determined it was more likely than not that most of the deferred tax assets would be realized. This decision was based on our cumulative history of book earnings over a 12-quarter period and on projections of expected future taxable income. The tax assets estimated to be realized in future periods have been calculated by applying a blended federal and state tax rate of 39.65%, which is based upon the tax rates expected to be in effect in the periods during which the attributes are expected to be utilized. Changes in this blended rate in future periods could have a material effect on both the tax provision in the period of change as well as the net deferred tax asset carrying value. We have recorded tax reserves to address potential exposures involving our sales and use and franchise tax positions. These potential exposures result from the varying application of statutes, rules, regulations and interpretations by different jurisdictions. Our determination of the amount of these tax reserves involves assumptions based on past experiences and judgments about the interpretation of statutes, rules and regulations by taxing jurisdictions. It is possible that the cost of the ultimate resolution of these matters may be greater or less than the amount that we estimated. Accounting for Stock Options Historically, through December 31, 2005, we recognized stock option costs pursuant to Accounting Principles Board Opinion, or APB, No. 25, Accounting for Stock Issued to Employees, and related interpretations. We have disclosed the impact of expensing stock options pursuant to SFAS No. 123, Accounting for Stock-Based Compensation, in the notes to our consolidated financial statements. Effective in 2006, we will adopt the provisions of SFAS No. 123R, Share-Based Payment. Both SFAS No. 123 and 123R require management to make assumptions to determine the fair value of stock options, including the expected life of the stock options and the volatility of the underlying common stock. Changes to the assumptions may have a significant impact on the fair value of the stock options, which could have a material impact on our financial statements. Additionally, in our pro forma disclosure, we incorporate a forfeiture estimate as we recognize equity expense. Should our actual forfeitures differ from our estimates, this could have a material impact on our consolidated financial statements. Capitalized Internal-Use Software Costs: We capitalize the salaries and payroll-related costs of employees and consultants who devote time to the development of internal-use software projects. If a project constitutes an enhancement to previously developed software, we assess whether the enhancement is significant and creates additional functionality to the software, thus qualifying the work incurred for capitalization. Once the project is complete, we estimate the useful life of the internal-use software, and we periodically assess whether the software is impaired. Changes in our estimates related to internal-use software would increase or decrease operating expenses or amortization recorded during the period. Results of Operations Revenues. Total revenues increased 35%, or $73.1 million, to $283.1 million for the year ended December 31, 2005 as compared to $210.0 million for the year ended December 31, 2004. Total revenues increased 30%, or $48.8 million, to $210.0 million for the year ended December 31, 2004 as compared to $161.3 million for the year ended December 31, 2003. The increase in total revenues for 2005 as compared to 2004 was attributable to an 22 Table of Contents increase in service revenue of $74.7 million, partially offset by a reduction in software and software-related revenue of $1.6 million. The increase in total revenues for 2004 as compared to 2003 was attributable to an increase in service revenue of $49.4 million, partially offset by a reduction in software and software-related revenue of $477,000 and related party revenue of $137,000. Service revenue, which consists of revenue from our content and application delivery services, increased 36%, or $74.7 million, to $281.5 million for the year ended December 31, 2005 as compared to $206.8 million for the year ended December 31, 2004. Service revenue was $157.4 million for the year ended December 31, 2003. The increases in service revenue were primarily attributable to increases in the number of customers under recurring revenue contracts, as well as increases in traffic and additional services sold to new and existing customers and increases in the average revenue per customer. These increases are attributable to greater market acceptance of our services among new customers and improvements in our ability to sell additional features to our existing customers. Also contributing to the increases in service revenue were revenues generated from the acquisition of Speedera on June 10, 2005. As of December 31, 2005, we had 1,910 customers under recurring revenue contracts as compared to 1,310 as of December 31, 2004, and 1,126 as of December 31, 2003. For 2005 and 2004, 21% and 19%, respectively, of our total revenues was derived from our operations located outside of the United States, of which 16% and 14% of overall revenues, respectively, was derived from operations in Europe. For 2003, 16% of our total revenues was derived from our operations located outside of the United States, of which 13% of overall revenues was derived from operations in Europe. No single country accounted for 10% or more of revenues derived outside of the United States during these periods. Resellers accounted for 24% of revenues in 2005, 27% in 2004 and 25% in 2003. For 2005, no single customer accounted for 10% or more of total revenues. For 2004 and 2003, Microsoft Corporation accounted for 10% and 15%, respectively, of total revenues. Software and software-related revenue decreased 49%, or $1.6 million, to $1.6 million for the year ended December 31, 2005 as compared to $3.3 million for the year ended December 31, 2004. Software and software-related revenue was $3.7 million for the year ended December 31, 2003. Software and software-related revenue includes sales of customized software projects and technology licensing. The decreases in software and software-related revenue over the periods presented reflect a reduction in the number of customized software projects that we undertook for customers and a decrease in the number of software licenses executed with customers. We do not expect software and software-related revenue to increase as a percentage of revenues in 2006. We had no revenue from related parties during 2005 and 2004. Service and software revenue from related parties was $137,000 for the year ended December 31, 2003. Related party revenue in 2003 represented revenue from Akamai Australia, a joint venture with ES Group Ventures Pty Ltd, relating to resale commitments. In June 2003, this joint venture was terminated. We do not expect to have any revenue from related parties in 2006. Cost of Revenues. Cost of revenues includes fees paid to network providers for bandwidth and co-location of our network equipment. Cost of revenues also includes payroll and related costs and equity-related compensation for network operations personnel, cost of software licenses, depreciation of network equipment used to deliver our services and amortization of internal-use software. Cost of revenues increased 21%, or $9.5 million, to $55.7 million for the year ended December 31, 2005 as compared to $46.2 million for the year ended December 31, 2004. Cost of revenues decreased 24%, or $14.7 million, to $46.2 million for the year ended December 31, 2004 compared to $60.8 million for the year ended December 31, 2003. The increase in cost of revenues for 2005 as compared to 2004 was primarily due to an increase in aggregate bandwidth costs due to higher traffic levels and an increase in depreciation expense of network equipment as we continue to invest in our infrastructure, partially offset by reduced bandwidth costs per unit. The total cost of revenues decreased in 2004 as compared to 2003 as a result of a decline in depreciation expense of network equipment as the impact of our network assets becoming fully depreciated exceeded the depreciation from the investments we made in our network infrastructure. The decline in deprecation expense in 2004 was partially offset by an increase in total bandwidth costs due to an increase in the amount of traffic delivered. Cost of revenues during 2005, 2004 and 2003 also included credits of $1.2 million, $1.0 million and $3.0 million, respectively, as a result of settlements and renegotiations entered into in connection with billing 23 Table of Contents disputes related to bandwidth contracts. Credits of this nature may occur in the future; however, the timing and amount of future credits, if any, will vary. Cost of revenues is comprised of the following (in millions): For the Year Ended December 31, 2005 2004 2003 Bandwidth, co-location and storage fees $ 35.6 $ 27.7 $ 24.5 Payroll and related costs of network operations personnel, including equity-related compensation 3.8 3.5 2.9 Cost of software licenses 0.7 1.0 0.4 Depreciation and impairment of network equipment and amortization of internal-use software 15.6 14.0 33.0 Total cost of revenues $ 55.7 $ 46.2 $ 60.8 We have long-term purchase commitments for bandwidth usage and co-location with various networks and Internet service providers. For the years ending December 31, 2006, 2007 and 2008, the minimum commitments related to bandwidth usage and co-location services are approximately $6.0 million, $1.1 million and $409,000, respectively. We believe cost of revenues will increase in 2006. We expect to deliver more traffic on our network, which would result in higher expenses associated with the increased traffic; however, such costs are likely to be partially offset by lower bandwidth costs per unit. Additionally, we expect increases in depreciation expense related to our network equipment and amortization of internal-use software development costs, as well as an increase in payroll and payroll-related costs, as we continue to make investments in our network to service our expanding customer base. Additionally, with the impact of implementing SFAS No. 123R for the expensing of employee stock awards at fair value beginning in the first quarter of 2006, we expect significant increases in cost of revenues attributable to equity-related compensation expense. Research and Development. Research and development expenses consist primarily of payroll and related costs and equity-related compensation for research and development personnel who design, develop, test and enhance our services and our network. Research and development costs are expensed as incurred, except certain software development costs requiring capitalization. During the years ended December 31, 2005, 2004 and 2003, we capitalized software development costs of $8.5 million, $7.5 million and $7.5 million, respectively, consisting of external consulting and payroll and payroll-related costs related to the development of internal-use software used to deliver our services and operate our network. These capitalized internal-use software costs are amortized to cost of revenues over their estimated useful lives of two years. Research and development expenses increased 49%, or $5.9 million, to $18.1 million for the year ended December 31, 2005 as compared to $12.1 million for the year ended December 31, 2004. Research and development expenses decreased 6%, or $839,000, to $12.1 million for the year ended December 31, 2004 as compared to $13.0 million for the year ended December 31, 2003. The increase in 2005 as compared to 2004 was primarily due to an increase in payroll and related costs due to an increase in headcount. The decrease in 2004 as compared to 2003 was primarily due to decreases in payroll and related costs, including equity-related compensation, as a reflection of the impact of workforce reductions in prior years and a reduction in equity compensation as stock awards became fully vested. The following table quantifies the net changes in research and development expenses over periods presented (in millions): Increase (Decrease) in Research and Development Expenses 2005 to 2004 2004 to 2003 Payroll and related costs, including equity-related compensation $ 5.9 $ (0.9 ) Capitalization of internal-use software development costs and other 0.1 Total increase (decrease) $ 5.9 $ (0.8 ) 24 Table of Contents We believe that research and development expenses will increase in 2006, as we continue to increase hiring of development personnel and make investments in our core technology and refinements to our other service offerings. Additionally, with the impact of implementing SFAS No. 123R for the expensing of employee stock awards at fair value beginning in the first quarter of 2006, we expect significant increases in research and development expense attributable to equity-related compensation expense. Sales and Marketing. Sales and marketing expenses consist primarily of payroll and related costs, equity-related compensation and commissions for personnel engaged in marketing, sales and service support functions, as well as advertising and promotional expenses. Sales and marketing expenses increased 40%, or $22.2 million, to $77.9 million for the year ended December 31, 2005 as compared to $55.7 million for the year ended December 31, 2004. Sales and marketing expenses increased 17%, or $8.1 million, to $55.7 million for the year ended December 31, 2004 as compared to $47.6 million for the year ended December 31, 2003. The increase in sales and marketing expenses during these periods was primarily due to higher payroll and related costs, particularly commissions, for sales and marketing personnel due to revenue growth. Additionally, marketing and related costs increased in 2005 due to higher advertising and promotional costs as compared to 2004. The following table quantifies the net increase in sales and marketing expenses for the periods presented (in millions): Increase in Sales and Marketing Expenses 2005 to 2004 2004 to 2003 Payroll and related costs, including equity-related compensation $ 17.1 $ 5.6 Marketing and related costs 2.4 0.9 Other expense 2.7 1.6 Total net increase $ 22.2 $ 8.1 We believe that sales and marketing expenses will continue to increase in 2006 due to an expected increase in commissions on higher forecasted sales, the expected increase in hiring of sales and marketing personnel and additional expected increases in marketing costs such as advertising. Additionally, with the impact of implementing SFAS No. 123R for the expensing of employee stock awards at fair value beginning in the first quarter of 2006, we expect significant increases in sales and marketing expenses attributable to equity-related compensation expense. General and Administrative. General and administrative expenses consist primarily of the following components: payroll and related costs, including equity-related compensation and related expenses for executive, finance, business applications, network management, human resources and other administrative personnel; depreciation of property and equipment used by us internally; fees for professional services; non-income related taxes; insurance costs; the provision for doubtful accounts; and rent and other facility-related expenditures for leased properties. General and administrative expenses increased 13%, or $6.0 million, to $53.0 million for the year ended December 31, 2005 as compared to $47.1 million for the year ended December 31, 2004. General and administrative expenses decreased 18%, or $10.2 million, to $47.1 million for the year ended December 31, 2004 as compared to $57.3 million for the year ended December 31, 2003. The increase in general and administrative expenses during 2005 was primarily due to an increase in payroll and related costs as a result of headcount growth, as well as an increase in the provision for doubtful accounts. This increase was offset by a reduction in legal and consulting costs associated with the dismissal of the lawsuits between Akamai and Speedera as a result of our 25 Table of Contents acquisition of Speedera. The decrease in general and administrative expenses during 2004 was primarily due to a reduction in depreciation expense as a result of assets becoming fully depreciated, a reduction in payroll and related costs, including equity compensation, as a result of equity awards becoming fully vested and reduced rent expense due to lease restructurings in prior years. During 2005 and 2004, consulting and advisory services increased significantly compared to those in 2003 as a result of the costs associated with the evaluation of our internal controls in order to allow management to report on, and our independent auditors to attest to, our internal control over financial reporting as required by Section 404 of the Sarbanes-Oxley Act of 2002. The following table quantifies the net change in general and administrative expenses for the periods presented (in millions): Increase (Decrease) in General and Administrative Expenses 2005 to 2004 2004 to 2003 Payroll and related costs, including equity-related compensation $ 8.0 $ (8.0 ) Rent and facilities 0.3 (1.2 ) Depreciation and amortization (1.1 ) (4.7 ) Provision for doubtful accounts 1.5 (1.0 ) Consulting and advisory services (2.6 ) 4.0 Other expenses (0.1 ) 0.7 Total net increase (decrease) $ 6.0 $ (10.2 ) During the years ended December 31, 2005 and 2004, we capitalized software development costs of $718,000 and $236,000, respectively, consisting of external consulting fees and payroll and payroll-related costs associated with the development of internally-used software applications. Once the projects are completed, such costs will be amortized and included in general and administrative expenses. We expect general and administrative expenses to increase in 2006 due to increased payroll and related costs attributable to increased hiring, an increase in non-income tax expense and an increase in rent and facilities costs as we expanded our leasing of office space in 2005. These increases will be offset by an expected reduction in legal costs. Additionally, with the impact of implementing SFAS No. 123R for the expensing of employee stock awards at fair value beginning in the first quarter of 2006, we expect significant increases in general and administrative expenses attributable to equity-related compensation expense. Amortization of Other Intangible Assets. Amortization of other intangible assets consists of the amortization of intangible assets acquired in business combinations and amortization of acquired license rights. Amortization of other intangible assets increased to $5.1 million for the year ended December 31, 2005 as compared to $48,000 for the year ended December 31, 2004. Amortization of other intangible assets for the year ended December 31, 2003 was $2.2 million. The increase in amortization of other intangible assets in 2005 was due to the amortization of intangible assets from the acquisition of Speedera in June 2005. Intangible assets acquired in prior acquisitions were fully amortized in the first quarter of 2003; consequently, there was no corresponding amortization of such assets in 2004. We expect to amortize approximately $8.4 million, $7.4 million, $6.1 million, $4.8 million and $4.1 million for fiscal years 2006, 2007, 2008, 2009 and 2010, respectively, in connection with the Speedera acquisition. Restructuring (Benefits) Charges. We did not record any restructuring charges or benefits during 2005 or 2004. During the year ended December 31, 2003, we recorded net restructuring benefits of $8.5 million as a result of amendments to certain real estate leases. During the year ended December 31, 2003, we amended or terminated three long-term leases in connection with which we paid our lessors a total of $16.1 million in cash and restricted cash. As a result of these amendments to, or terminations of, long-term leases, we reversed $9.6 million of previously recorded restructuring liabilities, offset by a restructuring charge of $1.1 million for costs relating to the restructuring of a facility located in Europe. The reversals represent the difference between the previously estimated restructuring liabilities and the amounts payable under negotiated agreements for certain leased properties with the landlords thereof. We estimate the amount of restructuring liabilities associated with real estate leases based on the most recent available market data and discussions with our lessors and real estate advisors. 26 Table of Contents We do not anticipate significant restructuring charges in the future; however, we will continue to pursue modifications or settlements on our long-term leases if we believe it to be in our best interest. Interest Income. Interest income includes interest earned on invested cash balances and marketable securities. Interest income increased 98%, or $2.1 million, to $4.3 million for the year ended December 31, 2005 as compared to $2.2 million for the year ended December 31, 2004. Interest income increased 66%, or $856,000, to $2.2 million for the year ended December 31, 2004 as compared to $1.3 million for the year ended December 31, 2003. The increase in interest income in 2005 and 2004 as compared to previous years was due to an increase in our invested marketable securities period over period as we generated more cash from operations and invested the proceeds from the issuance of our 1% convertible senior notes. In 2004 and 2005, we also experienced an increase in interest rates earned on our investments. In November 2005, we received proceeds of $202.1 million from our public equity offering of 12.0 million shares of our common stock; accordingly, we expect interest income to increase in 2006. Interest Expense. Interest expense includes interest paid on our debt obligations as well as amortization of deferred financing costs. Interest expense decreased 48%, or $4.9 million, to $5.3 million for the year ended December 31, 2005 compared to $10.2 million for the year ended December 31, 2004. Interest expense decreased 44%, or $8.1 million, to $10.2 million for the year ended December 31, 2004 as compared to $18.3 million for the year ended December 31, 2003. The decrease during each of these periods was due to lower interest expense as a result of redemptions and repurchases of our 5 1 / 2 % convertible subordinated notes at various times between December 2003 and September 2005, offset by interest payable on our 1% convertible senior notes issued in December 2003 and January 2004. During 2005 and 2004, we redeemed or repurchased $56.6 million and $169.4 million, respectively, in aggregate principal amount of our 5 1 / 2 % convertible subordinated notes. As a result of these transactions, we believe that interest expense on our debt obligations, including deferred financing amortization, will not exceed $3.1 million in 2006. Other (Expense) Income, net. Other net expense represents foreign exchange gains and losses incurred during the periods presented, as well as gains and losses on legal settlements. Other net expense increased 148%, or $1.6 million, to $507,000 for the year ended December 31, 2005 as compared to other net income of $1.1 million for the year ended December 31, 2004. Other net income increased to $1.1 million for the year ended December 31, 2004 as compared to other net expense of $44,000 for the year ended December 31, 2003. Other net expense for the year ended December 31, 2005 represented $1.5 million of foreign exchange losses, offset by $1.0 million of net gains on legal settlements. Other net income of $1.1 million for the year ended December 31, 2004 represented approximately $518,000 of gains on legal settlements and $543,000 of foreign exchange gains. For the year ended December 31, 2003, other net expense of $44,000 consisted of foreign exchange losses. Other net (expense) income may fluctuate in the future based upon the movement in foreign exchange rates. (Loss) Gain on Investments, net. During the years ended December 31, 2005 and 2004, we recorded a net loss on investments of $27,000 and $69,000, respectively, on the sale of marketable securities. During 2003, we recorded a net gain of $1.6 million, of which $1.7 million related to the sale of equity investments in publicly-traded companies, offset by losses of $55,000 on investments in privately-held companies and sales of marketable securities. We do not expect significant gains or losses on investments in 2006, as we no longer hold any substantial investments in publicly or privately-held companies. Loss on Early Extinguishment of Debt. Loss on early extinguishment of debt decreased to $1.4 million for the year ended December 31, 2005 as compared to $6.8 million for the year ended December 31, 2004. Loss on early extinguishment of debt increased to $6.8 million for the year ended December 31, 2004 as compared to $2.1 million for the year ended December 31, 2003. The decrease in loss on early extinguishment of debt in 2005 is due to costs incurred in connection with our redemption of $56.6 million in principal amount of our 5 1 / 2 % convertible subordinated notes during 2005. This loss of $1.4 million consists of $889,000 in premiums above par value paid to redeem such notes and $481,000 of deferred financing costs associated with redeeming the notes prior to their maturity. During 2004 and 2003, we repurchased $169.4 million and $74.0 million, respectively, in principal amount of our 5 1 / 2 % convertible subordinated notes which resulted in a loss on early extinguishment of debt of $6.8 million and $2.1 million, respectively. 27 Table of Contents (Benefit) Provision for Income Taxes. Benefit for income taxes increased to $257.6 million for the year ended December 31, 2005 as compared to a provision for income taxes of $772,000 during the year ended December 31, 2004. Provision for income taxes increased 23%, or $143,000, to $772,000 for the year ended December 31, 2004 as compared to $629,000 for the year ended December 31, 2003. During 2005, in connection with the release of our deferred tax asset valuation allowance, we recorded an income tax benefit of $285.8 million. The provision for income taxes for each of 2004 and 2003 was primarily related to our alternative minimum tax payment obligations and income earned in foreign jurisdictions where we were profitable. As of June 30, 2005, our United States and foreign net operating losses, or NOLs, and other deferred tax assets were fully offset by a valuation allowance primarily because at the time, pursuant to SFAS No. 109, Accounting for Income Taxes, we did not have sufficient history of taxable income to conclude that it was more likely than not that we would be able to realize the tax benefits of those deferred tax assets. Based upon our cumulative history of earnings over a 12-quarter period and an assessment of our expected future results of operations, during the third quarter of 2005, we determined that it is more likely than not that we would be able to realize a substantial portion of our United States and foreign NOL carryforward tax assets prior to their expiration and other deferred tax assets. As a result, during the third quarter of 2005, we released a total of $321.8 million of our United States and foreign deferred tax asset valuation allowance. Of the $321.8 million, $258.1 million of the valuation release was recorded as an income tax benefit in our statement of operations, $61.0 million of the valuation release was attributable to stock option exercises, which was recorded as an increase in additional paid-in capital on the balance sheet, and approximately $2.7 million of the valuation release was recorded as a reduction to acquired goodwill and intangible assets. As of September 30, 2005, we had a remaining valuation allowance of $35.6 million. During the fourth quarter of 2005, the Company released the remainder of the valuation allowance, except for $6.9 million that we will maintain because the realization of certain deferred tax assets does not meet the more likely than not criterion under SFAS No. 109. This portion of the valuation allowance primarily relates to certain state NOLs with a five-year carryover period that, as of December 31, 2005, we expect will expire unused. The fourth-quarter valuation allowance release is consistent with the requirement under APB No. 28 Interim Financial Reporting, that we use an annualized effective tax rate for each interim period during the year, including current year interim periods, after a valuation allowance release has occurred. The total valuation allowance release recorded as an income tax benefit in our consolidated statement of operations for 2005 was $285.8 million. Our effective tax rate for the year ended December 31, 2005 remained relatively low before considering the deferred tax valuation allowance release as discussed above; however, our annualized effective tax rate in future periods after 2005 is expected to significantly increase. We expect that our consolidated annualized effective tax rate in 2006 will be approximately 40%. Because of the availability of the NOLs discussed above, a significant portion of our future provision for income taxes is expected to be a non-cash expense; consequently, the amount of cash paid with respect to income taxes is expected to be a relatively small portion of the total annualized tax expense during periods in which the NOLs are utilized. In determining our net deferred tax assets and valuation allowances, and projections of our future provision for income taxes, annualized effective tax rates, and cash paid for income taxes, management is required to make judgments and estimates about domestic and foreign profitability, the timing and extent of the utilization of NOL carryforwards, applicable tax rates, transfer pricing methodologies and tax planning strategies. Judgments and estimates related to our projections and assumptions are inherently uncertain; therefore, actual results could differ materially from our projections. We have recorded certain tax reserves to address potential exposures involving our sales and use and franchise tax positions. These potential tax liabilities result from the varying application of statutes, rules, regulations and interpretations by different jurisdictions. Our estimate of the value of these tax reserves reflects assumptions based on past experiences and judgments about the interpretation of statutes, rules and regulations by taxing jurisdictions. It is possible that the ultimate resolution of these matters may be greater or less than the amount that we have estimated. 28 Table of Contents Liquidity and Capital Resources To date, we have financed our operations primarily through the following transactions: private sales of capital stock and subordinated notes, which were repaid in 1999; an initial public offering of our common stock in October 1999 that provided $217.6 million after underwriters discounts and commissions; the sale in June 2000 of an aggregate of $300 million in principal amount of our 5 1 / 2 % convertible subordinated notes, which were retired in full between December 2003 and September 2005, which generated net proceeds of $290.2 million; the sale in December 2003 and January 2004 of an aggregate $200 million in principal amount of our 1% convertible senior notes, which generated net proceeds of $194.1 million; the public offering of 12.0 million shares of our common stock in November 2005, which generated net proceeds of $202.1 million; and cash generated by operations. As of December 31, 2005, cash, cash equivalents and marketable securities totaled $314.1 million, of which $4.5 million is subject to restrictions limiting our ability to withdraw or otherwise use such cash, cash equivalents and marketable securities. See Letters of Credit below. Cash provided by operating activities increased $31.6 million to $82.8 million for the year ended December 31, 2005 compared to $51.2 million for the year ended December 31, 2004. Cash provided by operating activities increased $69.2 million to $51.2 million for the year ended December 31, 2004 compared to cash used in operating activities of $18.0 million for the year ended December 31, 2003. The increase in cash provided by operating activities for each of 2005 and 2004 as compared to previous years was primarily due to increased service revenue and increases in deferred revenue. We expect that cash provided by operating activities will continue to increase as a result of an upward trend in cash collections related to higher revenues, partially offset by an expected increase in operating expenses that require cash outlays such as salaries in connection with expected increases in headcount. The timing and amount of future working capital changes and our ability to manage our days sales outstanding will also affect the future amount of cash used in or provided by operating activities. Cash used in investing activities was $183.8 million for the year ended December 31, 2005, compared to cash provided by investing activities of $9.1 million for the year ended December 31, 2004. Cash used in investing activities was $33.1 million for the year ended December 31, 2003. Cash used in investing activities for 2005 reflects net purchases of marketable securities of $149.5 million primarily related to the cash received from our equity financing in November 2005. Additionally, cash used in investing activities for 2005 includes capital expenditures of $36.2 million, consisting of the capitalization of the purchase of network infrastructure equipment and internal-use software development costs related to our current and future service offerings. These investments were offset by $1.7 million of cash acquired through the Speedera acquisition and a decrease of $202,000 in restricted investments previously held for security deposits. Cash provided by investing activities for 2004 reflects proceeds from net sales and maturities of investments of $24.1 million, offset by capital expenditures of $20.1 million. During 2004, cash provided by investing activities also included a decrease of $5.0 million in restricted cash to reflect our repurchase of $5.0 million in principal amount of our 5 1 / 2 % convertible subordinated notes in early 2004 and a decrease of $96,000 in restricted investments previously held for security deposits. Cash used in investing activities for 2003 reflects net purchases of investments of $19.3 million, an increase in restricted cash to reflect a commitment to repurchase $5.0 million in principal amount of our 5 1 / 2 % convertible subordinated notes in early 2004 and capital expenditures of $8.9 million. For 2006, we expect total capital expenditures, a component of cash used in investing activities, to be approximately the same percentage of revenues as 2005. Cash provided by financing activities was $159.1 million for the year ended December 31, 2005, compared to cash used in financing activities of approximately $131.9 million for the year ended December 31, 2004. Cash provided by financing activities was $105.2 million for the year ended December 31, 2003. Cash provided by financing activities in 2005 reflects net proceeds from our November 2005 equity offering of $202.1 million and 29 Table of Contents proceeds from issuances of common stock under our equity compensation plans of $14.5 million, offset by payments made to redeem $56.6 million in principal amount of our outstanding 5 1 / 2 % convertible subordinated notes and payments on capital lease obligations of $818,000. Cash used in financing activities in 2004 reflects payments for the repurchase of approximately $169.4 million in principal amount of our 5 1 / 2 % convertible subordinated notes and payments on our capital leases of $543,000, offset by net proceeds received from the issuance of our 1% convertible senior notes of $24.3 million and proceeds from issuances of common stock under our equity compensation plans of $13.8 million. Cash provided by financing activities in 2003 reflects net proceeds from the issuance of our 1% convertible senior notes of $169.8 million, proceeds from issuances of common stock under our equity compensation plans of $8.6 million, settlement of notes receivable for stock of $2.3 million, offset by payments for the repurchase of $74.0 million in principal amount of our 5 1 / 2 % convertible subordinated notes and payments on our capital leases of $1.4 million. Changes in cash, cash equivalents and marketable securities are dependent upon changes in working capital items such as deferred revenue, accounts payable, accounts receivable and various accrued expenses, as well as changes in our capital and financial structure, including debt repurchases and issuances, stock option exercises, sales of equity investments and similar events. The following table represents the net inflows and outflows of cash, cash equivalents and marketable securities for the periods presented (in millions): For the Year Ended December 31, 2005 2004 Cash, cash equivalents and marketable securities balance as of December 31, 2004 and 2003, respectively $ 108.4 $ 208.4 Changes in cash, cash equivalents and marketable securities: Receipts from customers 271.7 206.2 Payments to vendors (135.1 ) (91.0 ) Payments for employee payroll (90.4 ) (68.4 ) Debt repurchases (58.1 ) (169.4 ) Debt proceeds 24.3 Debt interest and premium payments (5.1 ) (18.1 ) Stock option exercises and employee stock purchase plan issuances 14.5 13.8 Equity offering proceeds 202.1 Cash acquired in business acquisition 3.9 Other 2.2 2.6 Net increase (decrease) 205.7 (100.0 ) Cash, cash equivalents and marketable securities balance as of December 31, 2005 and 2004, respectively $ 314.1 $ 108.4 We believe, based on our current business plan, that our current cash, cash equivalents and marketable securities of $314.1 million and forecasted cash flows from operations will be sufficient to meet our cash needs for working capital and capital expenditures and restructuring expenses for at least the next 24 months. If the assumptions underlying our business plan regarding future revenue and expenses change or if unexpected opportunities or needs arise, we may seek to raise additional cash by selling equity or debt securities. If additional funds are raised through the issuance of equity or debt securities, these securities could have rights, preferences and privileges senior to those accruing to holders of common stock, and the terms of such debt could impose restrictions on our operations. The sale of additional equity or convertible debt securities would also result in additional dilution to our stockholders. See Risk Factors elsewhere in this Annual Report on Form 10-K for further discussion of potential dilution. 30 Table of Contents Contractual Obligations, Contingent Liabilities and Commercial Commitments The following table presents our contractual obligations and commercial commitments as of December 31, 2005 over the next five years and thereafter (in millions): Payments Due by Period Contractual Less than 12 to 36 36 to 60 More than Obligations Total 12 Months Months Months 60 Months 1% convertible senior notes $ 200.0 $ $ $ $ 200.0 Interest on convertible notes outstanding assuming no early redemption or repurchases 56.0 2.0 4.0 4.0 46.0 Real estate operating leases 23.1 7.2 11.3 4.4 0.2 Bandwidth and co-location agreements 7.5 6.0 1.5 Vendor equipment purchase obligations 0.5 0.5 Open vendor purchase orders 3.1 3.1 Total contractual obligations $ 290.2 $ 18.8 $ 16.8 $ 8.4 $ 246.2 Letters of Credit As of December 31, 2005, we had outstanding $4.5 million in irrevocable letters of credit issued by us in favor of third-party beneficiaries, primarily related to long-term facility leases. The letters of credit are collateralized by restricted marketable securities, of which $3.8 million are classified as long-term marketable securities and $730,000 are classified as short-term marketable securities on our consolidated balance sheet dated as of December 31, 2005. The restrictions on these marketable securities lapse as we fulfill our obligations or as such obligations expire under the terms of the letters of credit. These restrictions are expected to lapse through May 2011. Off-Balance Sheet Arrangements We have entered into various indemnification arrangements with third parties, including vendors, customers, landlords, our officers and directors, stockholders of acquired companies, joint venture partners and third parties to whom and from whom we license technology. Generally, these indemnification agreements require us to reimburse losses suffered by third parties due to various events, such as lawsuits arising from patent or copyright infringement or our negligence. These indemnification obligations are considered off-balance sheet arrangements in accordance with FASB Interpretation 45, Guarantor Accounting and Disclosure Requirements for Guarantees, Including Indirect Guarantees of Indebtedness of Others. To date, we have not encountered material costs as a result of such obligations and have not accrued any liabilities related to such indemnification obligations in our financial statements. See Note 11 to our consolidated financial statements included in this annual report on Form 10-K for further discussion of these indemnification agreements. The conversion features of our 1% convertible senior notes are equity-linked derivatives. As such, we recognize these instruments as off-balance sheet arrangements. The conversion features associated with these notes would be accounted for as derivative instruments, except that they are indexed to our common stock and classified in stockholder equity. Therefore, these instruments meet the scope exception of paragraph 11(a) of SFAS No. 133, Accounting for Derivative Instruments and Hedging Activities, and are accordingly not accounted for as derivatives for purposes of SFAS No. 133. See Note 12 to our consolidated financial statements for more information. Litigation We are party to litigation which we consider routine and incidental to our business. Management does not expect the results of any of these actions to have a material adverse effect on our business, results of operations or financial condition. See Legal Proceedings elsewhere in this annual report on Form 10-K for further discussion on litigation. 31 Table of Contents Recent Accounting Pronouncements In December 2004, the FASB issued SFAS No. 123R, Share-Based Payment. Effective on January 1, 2006, we adopted the provisions of SFAS No. 123R, which requires all share-based payments to employees, including grants of stock options, to be recognized in the income statement based on their fair values as of the date of grant. The adoption of this statement will result in the expensing of the fair value of stock options granted to employees. Prior to the adoption of SFAS 123R, we disclosed the impact of expensing the fair value of stock options only in the notes to the financial statements, which is no longer permitted. See Equity-Related Compensation in Note 2 to our consolidated financial statements. SFAS No. 123R applies to new equity awards and to equity awards modified, repurchased, or canceled after the effective date of adoption. Additionally, compensation costs for the portion of awards for which the requisite service has not been rendered that are outstanding as of the effective date of adoption shall be recognized as the requisite service is rendered. The compensation cost for that portion of such awards shall be based on the grant-date fair value of those awards as calculated from the pro forma disclosures under SFAS No. 123. Changes to the grant-date fair value of equity awards granted before the effective date of this statement are precluded. The compensation cost for those earlier awards shall be attributed to periods beginning on or after the effective date of our adoption of SFAS 123R using the attribution method that was used under SFAS No. 123, which was the straight-line method. Any unearned or deferred compensation related to those earlier awards shall be written off against the appropriate equity accounts. Additionally, common stock purchased pursuant to stock options granted under our employee stock purchase plan will be expensed based upon the fair market value of the stock option. We adopted SFAS No. 123R on a modified prospective basis beginning January 1, 2006. Accordingly, the results of operations for future periods will not be comparable to our historical results of operations. The adoption of SFAS No. 123R will have a material impact on our results of operations, increasing cost of revenues, research and development, sales and marketing and general and administrative expenses. We currently estimate that adoption of the statement will reduce diluted earnings per share by approximately $0.14 in 2006; however, the amount may change based upon the number and value of additional stock option grants and forfeiture rates. We have utilized the Black-Scholes option pricing model to determine the value of our stock options. For more information on the impact of expensing stock options for the three years ended December 31, 2005, 2004 and 2003, see Equity-Related Compensation in Note 2 to our consolidated financial statements. SFAS No. 123R also changes the reporting of tax-related amounts within the statement of cash flows. The gross amount of any windfall tax benefits resulting from stock-based compensation will be reported as cash flows from financing activities. Under the indirect method of presentation of the statement of cash flows, any shortfalls resulting from the write-off of deferred tax assets will be reported in net income and classified within the change of deferred income taxes in the operating section of the statement of cash flows.
