Item 7. Management Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations Overview General Anadarko Petroleum Corporation primary line of business is the exploration, development, production, gathering, processing and marketing of natural gas, crude oil, condensate and NGLs. The Company major areas of operations are located in the United States and Algeria. The Company also has activity in China, Brazil, Venezuela, Qatar and several other countries. The Company focus is on adding high-margin oil and natural gas reserves at competitive costs and continuing to develop more efficient and effective ways of exploring for and producing oil and gas. The primary factors that affect the Company results of operations include, among other things, commodity prices for natural gas, crude oil and NGLs, production volumes, the Company ability to find additional oil and gas reserves, as well as the cost of finding reserves and changes in the levels of costs and expenses required for continuing operations. On August 10, 2006, Anadarko completed the acquisition of Kerr-McGee in an all-cash transaction totaling $16.5 billion plus the assumption of $2.6 billion debt. On August 23, 2006, Anadarko completed the acquisition of Western in an all-cash transaction totaling $4.8 billion plus the assumption of $625 million debt. Anadarko financed $22.5 billion for the acquisitions under a 364-day committed acquisition facility. In November 2006, the Company sold its wholly-owned Canadian oil and gas subsidiary, Anadarko Canada Corporation, for approximately $4.3 billion before tax. After tax proceeds from the divestiture were used to reduce debt under the acquisition facility. Unless noted otherwise, the following information relates to continuing operations and excludes the discontinued Canadian operations. See Acquisitions and Divestitures, Outlook and Discontinued Operations for additional information. During 2004, Anadarko implemented an asset realignment that resulted in the Company completing over $3 billion in pretax asset sales of certain non-core properties in the latter half of 2004 through a series of unrelated transactions. Combined, the divested properties represented about 11% of Anadarko total year-end 2003 proved reserves and about 20% of total 2004 oil and gas production. The Company used proceeds from these asset sales to reduce debt, repurchase Anadarko common stock and otherwise to have funds available for reinvestment in other strategic options. Results of Continuing Operations Selected Data millions except per share amounts 2006 2005 2004 Financial Results Revenues $ 10,187 $ 6,187 $ 5,124 Costs and expenses 5,300 2,652 2,607 Interest expense and other (income) expense 649 130 417 Income tax expense 1,442 1,332 799 Income from continuing operations $ 2,796 $ 2,073 $ 1,301 Earnings per common share diluted $ 6.02 $ 4.36 $ 2.58 Average number of common shares outstanding diluted 464 475 503 Operating Results Total proved reserves (MMBOE) 3,011 2,187 2,113 Annual sales volumes (MMBOE) 178 138 161 Capital Resources and Liquidity Cash provided by operating activities $ 5,034 $ 3,502 $ 2,743 Capital expenditures 4,594 2,943 2,510 Total debt 22,991 3,627 3,790 Stockholders equity $ 14,913 $ 11,051 $ 9,285 Debt to total capitalization ratio 61% 25% 29% 32 Table of Contents Index to Financial Statements In May 2006, the Company shareholders approved an increase in authorized shares so Anadarko could complete a two-for-one stock split to be effected in the form of a stock dividend. The distribution date was May 26, 2006 to stockholders of record on May 12, 2006. All prior period share and per share information presented on the following pages have been revised to reflect the stock split. Anadarko financial and operating results for 2006 include the operating results of Kerr-McGee and Western since the dates of their acquisition. Financial Results Continuing Operations Net Income Anadarko net income from continuing operations for 2006 totaled $2.8 billion, or $6.02 per share (diluted), compared to net income from continuing operations for 2005 of $2.1 billion, or $4.36 per share (diluted). Anadarko had net income from continuing operations in 2004 of $1.3 billion, or $2.58 per share (diluted). The increase in 2006 net income was primarily due to higher sales volumes and net realized commodity prices, partially offset by higher operating costs and expenses and higher interest expense. The higher sales volumes, operating expenses and interest expense were due primarily to the impact of operations acquired and debt incurred with the third quarter 2006 acquisitions, charges associated with impairments of certain international properties and an increase in other costs and expenses. The increase in 2005 net income compared to 2004 was primarily due to higher net realized commodity prices and lower expenses, partially offset by lower volumes associated with divestitures in late 2004. Natural gas sales, and oil and condensate sales for 2006 include $579 million and $258 million, respectively, related to the recognition of net unrealized gains on derivatives used to manage price risk. Unrealized gains (losses) related to derivatives were not material in 2005 or 2004. The majority of the unrealized gains recognized in 2006 related to derivatives assumed with the Kerr-McGee acquisition. Revenues millions 2006 2005 2004 Gas sales $ 4,186 $ 2,968 $ 2,583 Oil and condensate sales 4,601 2,703 2,022 Natural gas liquids sales 594 437 439 Gathering, processing and marketing sales 718 76 51 Other 88 3 29 Total $ 10,187 $ 6,187 $ 5,124 Anadarko total revenues for 2006 increased 65% compared to 2005 and total revenues for 2005 increased 21% compared to 2004. The increase in 2006 was primarily due to higher sales volumes and net commodity prices. The increase in 2005 was primarily due to higher net commodity prices and higher sales volumes from core oil and gas properties, partially offset by lower volumes resulting from the divestiture of non-core properties in late 2004. The Company utilizes derivative instruments to manage the risk of a decrease in the market prices for its anticipated sales of natural gas, crude oil and condensate and NGLs. This activity is referred to as price risk management. The impact of price risk management increased total revenues $1,131 million during 2006 compared to a decrease of $294 million in 2005. The impact of price risk management decreased total revenues $518 million during 2004.

During 2005, Anadarko daily sales volumes decreased 14% compared to 2004 due to lower sales volumes in the United States as a result of divestitures of non-core properties in late 2004. Sales volumes represent actual production volumes adjusted for changes in commodity inventories. Anadarko employs marketing strategies to help manage volumes and mitigate the effect of price volatility, which is likely to continue in the future. Natural Gas Sales Volumes and Average Prices 2006 2005 2004 United States (Bcf) 558 414 499 MMcf/d 1,529 1,136 1,363 Price per Mcf $ 6.14 $ 7.44 $ 5.62 Gains (losses) on derivatives $ 1.36 $ (0.28 ) $ (0.44 ) Total price per Mcf $ 7.50 $ 7.16 $ 5.18 Anadarko daily natural gas sales volumes in 2006 increased 35% compared to 2005. The increases were primarily due to higher sales volumes associated with the third quarter acquisitions and higher volumes in the Haley field of West Texas, partially offset by natural declines in east Texas and north Louisiana. The Company daily natural gas sales volumes for 2005 were down 17% compared to 2004 primarily due to the impact of divestitures in the United States in late 2004, partially offset by higher volumes associated with successful drilling onshore in the United States. Production of natural gas is generally not directly affected by seasonal swings in demand. Excluding the impact of both realized and unrealized gains and losses on derivatives, Anadarko average natural gas price for 2006 decreased 17% compared to the same period of 2005. Excluding the impact of both realized and unrealized gains and losses on derivatives, Anadarko average natural gas price for 2005 increased 32% compared to the same period of 2004. The increase in prices in 2005 is attributed to continued strong demand in North America and an active hurricane season in the Gulf of Mexico impacting supply and infrastructure. As of December 31, 2006, the Company has utilized price risk management on 36% of its anticipated natural gas wellhead sales volumes for 2007. 34 Table of Contents Index to Financial Statements Crude Oil and Condensate Sales Volumes and Average Prices 2006 2005 2004 United States (MMBbls) 39 24 32 MBbls/d 108 68 88 Price per barrel $ 59.41 $ 51.67 $ 38.71 Gains (losses) on derivatives $ 9.18 $ (7.32 ) $ (7.06 ) Total price per barrel $ 68.59 $ 44.35 $ 31.65 Algeria (MMBbls) 23 24 22 MBbls/d 64 65 61 Price per barrel $ 65.59 $ 54.38 $ 34.78 Other International (MMBbls) 8 8 8 MBbls/d 21 22 22 Price per barrel $ 48.58 $ 39.37 $ 27.91 Total (MMBbls) 70 56 62 MBbls/d 193 155 171 Price per barrel $ 60.29 $ 51.03 $ 37.12 Gains (losses) on derivatives $ 5.15 $ (3.19 ) $ (4.84 ) Total price per barrel $ 65.44 $ 47.84 $ 32.28 Anadarko daily crude oil and condensate sales volumes for 2006 were up 25% compared to the same period of 2005. The increases in 2006 were primarily due to higher sales volumes associated with the third quarter 2006 acquisitions and additional wells being tied in and put into production at the Company legacy properties in the Gulf of Mexico, partially offset by a decrease in sales volumes from Venezuela due to recent contract changes. Anadarko daily crude oil and condensate sales volumes for 2005 decreased 9% compared to 2004 due to the impact of divestitures in the United States in late 2004. These decreases were partially offset by higher volumes in the United States associated with expansion of production facilities in Alaska and successful drilling in the western states and higher volumes in Algeria. Production of oil usually is not affected by seasonal swings in demand. Excluding the impact of both realized and unrealized gains and losses on derivatives, Anadarko average crude oil price for 2006 increased 18% compared to the same period of 2005 and increased 37% for 2005 compared to the same period of 2004. The higher crude oil prices were attributed to continuing political unrest in oil exporting countries, increased worldwide demand and the impact of hurricanes in the Gulf of Mexico on oil production and infrastructure. As of December 31, 2006, the Company has utilized price risk management on 41% of its anticipated oil and condensate volumes for 2007. Natural Gas Liquids Sales Volumes and Average Prices 2006 2005 2004 Total (MMBbls) 15 13 16 MBbls/d 42 36 43 Price per barrel $ 39.58 $ 34.56 $ 27.84 Anadarko daily NGLs sales volumes in 2006 were up 17% compared to 2005, primarily due to higher sales volumes associated with the third quarter 2006 acquisitions. The Company 2005 daily NGLs sales volumes were down 16% compared to 2004, primarily due to the impact of divestitures in the United States in 2004. During 2006, average NGLs prices increased 15% compared to the same period of 2005 and increased 24% for 2005 compared to the same period of 2004. NGLs production is dependent on natural gas and NGLs prices as well as the economics of processing the natural gas to extract NGLs. NGLs sales represent revenues derived from the processing of Anadarko natural gas production. 35 Table of Contents Index to Financial Statements Gathering, Processing and Marketing Revenues millions 2006 2005 2004 Gathering and processing sales $ 538 $ 26 $ 21 Marketing sales 180 50 30 Total $ 718 $ 76 $ 51 During 2006, gathering and processing sales increased $512 million compared to the same period of 2005. The increase was due primarily to gathering and processing operations acquired with the 2006 acquisitions. During 2005, gathering and processing sales increased $5 million compared to the same period of 2004. Gathering and processing revenues represent revenues derived from gathering and processing natural gas from sources other than the Company production. Marketing sales primarily represent the revenues earned on sales of third party gas, oil and NGLs, net of purchases. Costs and Expenses millions 2006 2005 2004 Oil and gas operating $ 799 $ 400 $ 481 Oil and gas transportation and other 341 256 218 Gathering, processing and marketing 553 56 39 General and administrative 668 393 373 Depreciation, depletion and amortization 1,976 1,111 1,132 Other taxes 575 358 292 Impairments 388 78 72 Total $ 5,300 $ 2,652 $ 2,607 During 2006, Anadarko costs and expenses increased 100% compared to 2005 due to the following factors: Oil and gas operating expense increased 100% due to $253 million in operating expenses for properties acquired with the 2006 acquisitions and $146 million associated with increased workover, maintenance and repair activity in the United States, an increase in expenses in the Gulf of Mexico associated with higher volumes, and rising utility and fuel expenses as a result of higher energy costs and industry demand. Oil and gas transportation and other expenses increased 33%. Transportation expenses increased primarily due to higher volumes transported as a result of the 2006 acquisitions. Gathering, processing and marketing expenses increased $497 million. Costs associated with gathering and processing operations increased $430 million primarily due to facilities acquired with Western and Kerr-McGee. Marketing transportation and cost of product increased $67 million primarily due to higher volumes transported as a result of the 2006 acquisitions and the assumption of firm transportation contracts during the year. General and administrative (G&A) expense increased 70% due primarily to increases of $93 million related to compensation, legal and other general expenses attributed to the operations acquired from Kerr-McGee and Western, $77 million associated with rising compensation costs for legacy employees, $77 million related to severance and one-time benefits associated with Company initial post acquisition asset realignment and restructuring efforts and $28 million related to increases in general office expenses at legacy locations. Depreciation, depletion and amortization (DD&A) expense increased 78%. DD&A expense associated with oil and gas properties increased $479 million due to higher costs associated with acquiring, finding and developing oil and gas reserves, $307 million due to higher volumes associated with the acquisitions and $13 million related to higher asset retirement obligation accretion expense. Depreciation of other property and equipment increased $66 million due primarily to gathering, processing and general properties obtained with the third quarter 2006 acquisitions. The total impact of the third quarter 2006 acquisitions on DD&A expense was an increase of $706 million. 36 Table of Contents Index to Financial Statements Other taxes increased 61%. The increase includes a $103 million accrual for the estimated impact of a new Algerian exceptional profits tax. See Other Developments . The remaining increase of $114 million is primarily due to the effect of higher production volumes and higher commodity prices on production taxes. Impairments in 2006 include a $178 million loss associated with the termination of the Venezuela operating service agreement in exchange for an 18% equity interest in a new operating company, a $139 million impairment related to the decision to suspend construction of the Company Bear Head LNG project in Nova Scotia and $71 million in impairments related to exploration activities at various international locations. During 2005, Anadarko costs and expenses increased 2% compared to 2004 due to the following factors: Oil and gas operating expense decreased $81 million primarily due to the impact of properties divested in late 2004 and included $12 million associated with 2004 severance and other costs related to divestitures and reorganization efforts. Oil and gas transportation and other expenses increased 17%. The $12 million increase in transportation cost was primarily due to a change in the Company marketing strategy whereby the Company is transporting a higher percentage of its natural gas volumes to higher priced markets. Gathering, processing and marketing expenses increased 44% primarily due to higher transportation expenses and NGLs transportation, fractionation and processing costs. The $36 million increase in transportation cost was primarily due to a change in the Company marketing strategy whereby the Company is transporting a higher percentage of its natural gas volumes to higher priced markets. The $12 million increase in NGLs transportation and fractionation cost was primarily due to a change in the Company marketing strategy whereby the Company is fractionating its raw NGLs stream into the individual products in order to obtain higher sales proceeds for NGLs. Cost of product was up about $12 million primarily due to higher NGLs processing costs as a result of increased natural gas prices. These cost increases are offset by higher natural gas, NGLs, gathering, processing and marketing sales revenues. G&A expense increased 5% primarily due to an increase of $47 million in compensation, pension and other postretirement benefits expenses attributed primarily to the rising cost of attracting and retaining a highly qualified workforce, including the Company decision to provide a more performance-based compensation program to a broader base of employees. This increase also reflects the continued upward pressure on benefits expenses, including the impact of lower discount rates on estimated pension and other postretirement benefits expenses. Consulting, audit, rent and other miscellaneous expenses combined increased by $13 million. These increases were partially offset by a $28 million decrease in legal expenses and a decrease of $16 million due to 2004 severance and other costs related to divestitures and reorganization efforts. DD&A expense decreased 2%. DD&A expense includes decreases of $151 million related to lower production volumes and $8 million related to lower asset retirement obligation accretion expense, both primarily due to the impact of 2004 divested properties. These decreases were partially offset by an increase of $138 million primarily due to higher costs associated with finding and developing oil and gas reserves (including the transfer of excluded costs to the DD&A pool). Other taxes increased 23% primarily due to higher commodity prices, partially offset by the impact of properties divested in 2004. Impairments of oil and gas properties in 2005 include $35 million related to unsuccessful exploration activities in Tunisia, $30 million related to exploration activities at various international locations and $13 million related to the disposition of properties in Oman. 37 Table of Contents Index to Financial Statements Interest Expense and Other (Income) Expense millions 2006 2005 2004 Interest Expense Gross interest expense $ 730 $ 266 $ 328 Premium and related expenses for early retirement of debt 100 Capitalized interest (75 ) (60 ) (70 ) Net interest expense 655 206 358 Other (Income) Expense Interest income (47 ) (17 ) (5 ) Firm transportation keep-whole contract valuation 4 (56 ) (1 ) Operating lease settlement 63 Other 37 (3 ) 2 Total other (income) expense (6 ) (76 ) 59 Total $ 649 $ 130 $ 417 Interest Expense Anadarko gross interest expense increased 174% during 2006 compared to 2005. The increase was primarily due to an increase in debt associated with the acquisitions of Kerr-McGee and Western. Gross interest expense in 2005 decreased 19% compared to 2004 due to lower average outstanding debt. Interest expense for 2004 included $100 million of premiums and related expenses for the early retirement of debt in 2004. For additional information see Acquisitions and Divestitures and Debt below and Interest Rate Risk under Item 7a of this Form 10-K. In 2006, capitalized interest increased by 25% compared to 2005. The 2006 increase was primarily due to the higher capitalized costs that qualify for interest capitalization. In 2005, capitalized interest decreased by 14% compared to 2004. The 2005 decrease was primarily due to lower capitalized costs that qualify for interest capitalization. Other (Income) Expense For 2006, the Company had other income of $6 million compared to other income of $76 million for 2005. The decrease of $70 million was primarily due to a $60 million decrease in gains related to the effect of market values for firm transportation subject to a keep-whole agreement, a $22 million loss on an impaired equity investment and an $18 million loss related to environmental and legal reserve adjustments, partially offset by a $30 million increase in interest income. The keep-whole agreement was terminated April 1, 2006. For 2005, the Company had other income of $76 million compared to other expense of $59 million for 2004. The favorable change of $135 million was primarily due to a $63 million loss in 2004 related to an operating lease settlement for the Corpus Christi West Plant Refinery, a favorable change of $55 million related to the effect of higher market values for firm transportation subject to the keep-whole agreement and an increase in interest income of $12 million. 38 Table of Contents Index to Financial Statements Income Tax Expense millions except percentages 2006 2005 2004 Income tax expense $ 1,442 $ 1,332 $ 799 Effective tax rate 34% 39% 38% For 2006, income taxes increased 8% compared to 2005 primarily due to an increase in income before income taxes, partially offset by a decrease in state income taxes resulting from enacted Texas legislation, excess U.S. foreign tax credits and a decrease in net foreign income taxes. For 2005, income taxes increased 67% compared to 2004 primarily due to higher income before income taxes. Variances from the 35% statutory rate are caused by foreign taxes in excess of federal statutory rates, state income taxes, excess U.S. foreign tax credits and other items. Texas House Bill 3, signed into law in May 2006, eliminates the taxable capital and earned surplus components of the existing franchise tax and replaces these components with a taxable margin tax calculated on a combined basis. There will be no impact on Anadarko 2006 Texas current state income taxes as the new tax is effective for reports due on or after January 1, 2008 (based on business activity during 2007). Anadarko is required to include the impact of the law change on its deferred state income taxes in income for the period which includes the date of enactment. The adjustment, a reduction in Anadarko deferred state income taxes in the amount of approximately $69 million, net of federal benefit, was included in the 2006 tax provision. Current tax expense related to the estimated taxable gains from the 2004 divestitures was recorded during 2004 with a corresponding reduction to deferred tax expense. As a result, total income tax expense and the effective tax rate for 2004 were not impacted by the divestitures. Operating Results Acquisitions and Divestitures In August 2006, Anadarko acquired Kerr-McGee and Western in separate all-cash transactions. Anadarko initially financed $22.5 billion for the acquisitions through a 364-day committed acquisition facility with plans to repay it with proceeds from asset sales, free cash flow from operations and the issuance of equity, debt and bank financing during the term of the facility. Anadarko intends to reduce leverage significantly in 2007 through a combination of continued asset sales, retained earnings buildup, excess cash flow beyond capital expenditures and possible securities offerings. See Outlook . As of December 31, 2006, the Company has refinanced approximately $6 billion of the acquisition facility with new long-term issuances and repaid approximately $5.5 billion with divestiture proceeds and cash flow from operations. Kerr-McGee Transaction On August 10, 2006, Anadarko completed the acquisition of Kerr-McGee for $16.5 billion, or $70.50 per share, plus the assumption of $2.6 billion of debt. Kerr-McGee year-end 2005 proved reserves, excluding Gulf of Mexico shelf divestitures, totaled 898 MMBOE, of which approximately 62% was natural gas. Proved undeveloped reserves represented 30% of the total. Kerr-McGee core properties are located in the deepwater Gulf of Mexico and onshore in Colorado and Utah. They include deepwater Gulf of Mexico blocks which are supported by Kerr-McGee hub-and-spoke infrastructure. In Colorado, Kerr-McGee holds acreage in the Wattenberg natural gas play, located largely on Anadarko Land Grant holdings, where Anadarko owns the royalty interest. In Utah, Kerr-McGee holds acreage in the Uinta basin prolific Greater Natural Buttes gas play. In addition to its U.S. portfolio, Kerr-McGee produces oil and is continuing to develop and explore offshore China, has made discoveries and is pursuing the development of fields on the North Slope of Alaska and offshore Brazil, and is exploring offshore Australia, West Africa and the islands of Trinidad and Tobago. Western Transaction On August 23, 2006, Anadarko completed the acquisition of Western for $4.8 billion, or $61.00 per share, plus the assumption of $625 million of debt. Western year-end 2005 proved reserves totaled 153 MMBOE, with proved undeveloped reserves representing 57% of the total. Essentially all of the reserves are natural gas. 39 Table of Contents Index to Financial Statements Western coalbed methane properties within the Powder River basin are directly adjacent to Anadarko assets in this developing play. Anadarko expects that combining its properties with Western will accelerate the development of these natural gas resources and produce volume growth through the end of the decade, and possibly longer, with more than 12,000 identified drilling locations in inventory. The acquisition of Western also significantly increased the Company holdings in gathering and processing systems. Divestitures In November 2006, Anadarko sold its wholly-owned subsidiary, Anadarko Canada Corporation, for approximately $4.3 billion before taxes. The sale is part of a portfolio refocusing effort stemming from the acquisitions of Kerr-McGee and Western. Net proceeds from the divestiture were used to retire debt. See Discontinued Operations . On the acquisition date, Kerr-McGee other assets included approximately $1 billion of assets held for sale. The sale of these assets closed in August 2006 and the proceeds were also used to pay down debt incurred to fund the acquisitions. In November 2006, Anadarko reached an agreement to sell its interests in the Knotty Head and Big Foot oil discoveries, as well as the Big Foot North prospect in the Gulf of Mexico for $901 million. In December 2006, the Company reached an agreement to sell its Vernon and Ansley fields, located in Jackson Parish, Louisiana, for $1.6 billion. In January 2007, Anadarko signed two separate unrelated agreements to sell its interests in the Williston basin, Elk basin and Gooseberry area of the Northern Rockies for a total of $810 million, as well as an agreement to divest control of Anadarko interests in 28 Permian basin oil fields in West Texas for $1 billion. Certain of these transactions have closed and the remaining transactions are expected to close in the first half of 2007. In February 2007, Anadarko signed an agreement to sell its interests in certain natural gas properties in Oklahoma and Texas for $860 million. This agreement is expected to close during the second quarter of 2007. During February, Anadarko also closed on the sale of its Genghis Khan discovery in the deepwater Gulf of Mexico for $1.33 billion. Anadarko will use net proceeds from all of these sales to further reduce debt under the acquisition facility. During 2004, Anadarko implemented an asset realignment that resulted in the Company completing over $3 billion in pretax asset sales of certain non-core properties in the latter half of 2004 through a series of unrelated transactions. The Company used proceeds from these asset sales to reduce debt, repurchase Anadarko common stock and otherwise to have funds available for reinvestment in other strategic options. Proved Reserves Anadarko focuses on growth and profitability. Reserve replacement is the key to growth and future profitability depends on the cost of finding and developing oil and gas reserves, among other factors. Reserve growth can be achieved through successful exploration and development drilling, improved recovery or acquisition of producing properties. The following discussion of proved reserves, reserve additions and revisions and future net cash flows from proved reserves includes both continuing and discontinued operations. A breakdown of reserve information by continuing and discontinued operations is contained in the Supplemental Information under Item 8 of this Form 10-K. MMBOE 2006 2005 2004 Proved Reserves Beginning of year 2,449 2,367 2,513 Reserve additions and revisions 1,043 291 335 Sales in place (287 ) (51 ) (290 ) Production (194 ) (158 ) (191 ) End of year 3,011 2,449 2,367 Proved Developed Reserves Beginning of year 1,524 1,517 1,727 End of year 1,989 1,524 1,517 40 Table of Contents Index to Financial Statements The Company proved natural gas reserves at year-end 2006 were 10.5 Tcf compared to 7.9 Tcf at year-end 2005 and 7.5 Tcf at year-end 2004. Anadarko proved crude oil, condensate and NGLs reserves at year-end 2006 were 1.3 billion barrels compared to 1.1 billion barrels at the end of both 2005 and 2004. Crude oil, condensate and NGLs comprised about 42%, 46% and 47% of the Company proved reserves at year-end 2006, 2005 and 2004, respectively. The Company estimates of proved reserves are made using available geological and reservoir data as well as production performance data. These estimates, made by the Company engineers, are reviewed annually and revised, either upward or downward, as warranted by additional data. The available data reviewed include, among other things, seismic data, structure and isopach maps, well logs, production tests, material balance calculations, reservoir simulation models, reservoir pressures, individual well and field performance data, individual well and field projections, offset performance data, operating expenses, capital costs and product prices. Revisions are necessary due to changes in, among other things, reservoir performance, prices, economic conditions and governmental restrictions. Decreases in prices, for example, may cause a reduction in some proved reserves due to reaching economic limits sooner. Reserve Additions and Revisions During 2006, the Company added 1,043 MMBOE of proved reserves as a result of additions (purchases in place, discoveries, improved recovery and extensions) and revisions. Additions During 2006, Anadarko added 1,278 MMBOE of proved reserves. Of this amount, 1,030 MMBOE were related to purchases in place primarily associated with the acquisitions of Kerr-McGee and Western. In addition, the Company added 248 MMBOE of proved reserves primarily as a result of successful drilling in core areas onshore in the United States. During 2005, Anadarko added 314 MMBOE of proved reserves. Of this amount, 309 MMBOE were added as a result of successful drilling in the deepwater Gulf of Mexico and fields in the north Louisiana Vernon, east Texas Bossier, west Texas Haley and Canadian Wild River areas and successful improved recovery operations in Wyoming. During 2004, Anadarko added 389 MMBOE of proved reserves through successful drilling in its North American properties and the deepwater Gulf of Mexico, successful improved recovery operations in Wyoming and minor producing property acquisitions. The Company expects the majority of future reserve additions to come from infill drilling and extensions of current fields and new discoveries onshore in North America and the deepwaters of the Gulf of Mexico, as well as through improved recovery operations, purchases of proved properties in strategic areas and successful exploration in international growth areas. The success of these operations will directly impact reserve additions or revisions in the future. Revisions Total revisions in 2006 were (235) MMBOE or 9.6% of the beginning of year reserve base. Performance revisions of (136) MMBOE were related primarily to downward revisions of the Company reserves at the K2 complex in the Gulf of Mexico and adjustments in Algeria. Price revisions in 2006 of (99) MMBOE were primarily due to a significant decrease in natural gas prices since the end of 2005. Total revisions for 2005 and 2004 were (23) MMBOE and (54) MMBOE, respectively. Revisions in 2005 related primarily to the impact of government imposed limits on production in Venezuela, as well as a reduction of NGLs reserves in Algeria resulting from a change in project scope. Revisions in 2004 related primarily to performance revisions of the Company reserves at Marco Polo and other properties, partially offset by positive revisions in other areas. 41 Table of Contents Index to Financial Statements An analysis of Anadarko proved reserve revisions split between performance and price revisions and shown as a percentage of the previous year-end proved reserves is presented in the following graph. During the 10-year period 1997 - 2006, Anadarko annual reserve revisions, up or down, have been below 10% of the previous year-end proved reserve base for both types of revisions. In the aggregate, over the past decade, the average reserve revision has been a negative 1.8% and the average performance-related reserve revision has been a negative 1.1%.

In addition, sales in place included 39 MMBOE of proved reserves related to government imposed contract changes which resulted in the Company Venezuelan properties being exchanged for an equity interest in a new Venezuela operating entity. In 2005, Anadarko sold properties located in the United States, Oman and Canada representing 25 MMBOE, 25 MMBOE and 1 MMBOE of proved reserves, respectively. In 2004, Anadarko sold properties in the United States and Canada representing 226 MMBOE and 64 MMBOE of proved reserves, respectively. Proved Undeveloped Reserves To improve investor confidence and provide transparency regarding the Company reserves, Anadarko reports the status of its proved undeveloped reserves (PUDs) annually. The Company annually reviews all PUDs, with a particular focus on those PUDs that have been booked for three or more years, to ensure that there is an appropriate plan for development. Generally, onshore United States PUDs are converted to proved developed reserves within two years. Certain projects, such as improved oil recovery, arctic development, deepwater development and many international programs, often take longer, sometimes beyond five years. About 37% of the Company PUDs booked prior to 2004 are in Algeria and are being developed according to an Algerian government approved plan. The remaining PUDs booked prior to 2004 are primarily associated with Alaska and ongoing programs in the onshore United States for improved recovery. 42 Table of Contents Index to Financial Statements The following data presents the Company PUDs vintage, geographic location and percentage of total proved reserves as of December 31, 2006: STAT TABLE FOR GRAPH ON PAGE 43 Worldwide Proved Undeveloped Reserves Years from Initial Booking PUDs (MMBOE) Cumulative % of PUDs 0 595 58 % 1 87 67 % 2 73 74 % 3 132 87 % 4 9 88 % 5+ 126 100 % 0 100 200 300 400 500 600 0% 25% 50% 75% 100% Worldwide Proved Undeveloped Reserves Analysis Country PUDs (MMBOE) Percentage of Total PUDs Percentage of Total Proved Reserves United States 897 88% 30% Algeria 111 11% 4% Other International 14 1% % Total 1,022 100% 34% 43 Table of Contents Index to Financial Statements The following graph shows the change in PUDs over the last three years, detailing the changes based on the year the PUDs were originally booked.

The Company history of production growth relative to proved reserve growth is shown below. This data demonstrates the Company ability to convert proved reserves to production in a timely manner. The increase in proved reserves and production in 2006 is primarily related to the third quarter acquisitions of Kerr-McGee and Western. The decrease in proved reserves in 2004 and production in 2005 is primarily related to properties sold in 2004.

This present value was calculated based on prices at year-end held flat for the life of the reserves, adjusted for any contractual provisions. The decrease of $3.7 billion or 12% in 2006 compared to 2005 is primarily due to a significant decrease in natural gas prices and the sale of Canadian operations, partially offset by increases associated with the Kerr-McGee and Western acquisitions. See Supplemental Information under Item 8 of this Form 10-K. The present value of future net cash flows does not purport to be an estimate of the fair market value of Anadarko proved reserves. An estimate of fair value would also take into account, among other things, anticipated changes in future prices and costs, the expected recovery of reserves in excess of proved reserves and a discount factor more representative of the time value of money and the risks inherent in producing oil and gas. Gathering, Processing and Marketing Strategies Overview Anadarko supports and seeks to enhance the value of its oil and gas operations through its GPM activities. These activities provide for the gathering, processing, transportation and ultimate sale of the Company production. In addition, the GPM function provides services for third-party customers. Gathering and Processing Anadarko invests in gathering and processing facilities (midstream) to complement its oil and gas operations in regions where the Company has significant production. The Company is better able to manage both the value received for, and cost of, gathering, treating and processing natural gas through its ownership and operation of these facilities. In addition, Anadarko midstream business provides gathering, treating and processing services for third-party customers, including major and independent producers. Anadarko generates revenues in its gathering and processing activities through various fee structures that include fixed rate, percent of proceeds, or keep-whole agreements. The Company also processes gas at various third-party plants. In 2006, Anadarko significantly increased the size and scope of its midstream business through the acquisitions of Western and Kerr-McGee. With these acquisitions, Anadarko has systems in eight states (Wyoming, Colorado, Utah, New Mexico, Kansas, Oklahoma, Texas and Louisiana) located in major producing basins of the onshore United States. Marketing The Company marketing department manages sales of its natural gas, crude oil and NGLs. In marketing its production, the Company attempts to maximize realized prices while managing credit exposure. The Company sales of natural gas, crude oil, condensate and NGLs are generally made at the market prices of those products at the time of sale. In 2006, the Company also engaged in sales of greenhouse gas emission reduction credits (ERCs) derived from CO 2 injection operations in Wyoming. The Company expects additional sales of ERCs in the future. The Company also purchases natural gas, crude oil and NGLs volumes for resale primarily from partners and producers near Anadarko production. These purchases allow the Company to aggregate larger volumes, fully utilize transportation capacity, attract larger, more creditworthy customers and facilitate its efforts to maximize prices received for the Company production. The Company may also engage in trading activities for the purpose of generating profits from exposure to changes in market prices of gas, oil, condensate and NGLs. The Company does not engage in market-making practices and limits its trading activities to oil, gas and NGL commodity contracts. The Company trading risk position, typically, is a net short position that is offset by the Company natural long position as a producer. See Energy Price Risk under Item 7a of this Form 10-K. In an effort to protect the Company from commodity price risk stemming from the acquisitions of Kerr-McGee and Western, the Company has derivatives in place covering 72% and 55% of the acquired companies expected volumes on a BOE basis for 2007 and 2008, respectively. This price risk management program employs the use of three-way collars, along with certain other derivatives, intended to help ensure a return on investment while maintaining upside potential that could result from higher commodity prices. In recent years, all segments of the energy market have experienced increased scrutiny of their financial condition, liquidity and credit. This has been reflected in rating agency credit downgrades of many merchant 45 Table of Contents Index to Financial Statements energy trading companies. Anadarko has not experienced any material financial losses associated with credit deterioration of third-party purchasers; however, in certain situations the Company has declined to transact with some counterparties and changed its sales terms to require some counterparties to pay in advance or post letters of credit for purchases. Natural Gas Natural gas continues to supply a significant portion of North America energy needs and the Company believes the importance of natural gas in meeting this energy need will continue. While natural gas prices have fallen over the last year, price volatility persists due to a relatively tight supply and demand balance. Anadarko markets its natural gas production to maximize the commodity value and reduce the inherent risks of the physical commodity markets. Anadarko Energy Services Company (AESC), a wholly-owned subsidiary of Anadarko, is a marketing company offering supply assurance, competitive pricing, risk management services and other services tailored to its customers needs. The Company sells natural gas under a variety of contracts and may also receive a service fee related to the level of reliability and service required by the customer. The Company has the marketing capability to move large volumes of gas into and out of the daily gas market to take advantage of any price volatility. The Company owns a significant amount of natural gas firm transportation capacity which is used to ensure access to downstream markets and provides the opportunity to capture incremental value when pricing differentials between physical locations occur. The Company also stores some of its purchased natural gas in contracted storage facilities with the intent of selling the gas at a higher price in the future. Normally, the Company has forward contracts in place (physical delivery or financial derivative instruments) to sell the stored gas at a fixed price. In 2005 and 2004, approximately 9% and 15%, respectively, of the Company gas production was sold under long-term contracts to Duke Energy Corporation (Duke). These sales represent 4% and 7% of total revenues related to continuing operations in 2005 and 2004, respectively. As these contracts expired, the Company integrated the marketing of the natural gas previously sold to Duke into its marketing operations and sells it to various purchasers at market prices. At the end of 2006, there were no volumes remaining under the original long-term contract with Duke. Volumes sold to Duke under the long-term contracts were at market prices. Western and Kerr-McGee both have gas marketing organizations that are being incorporated into AESC. Kerr-McGee has a long-term gas sales contract with Cinergy (since acquired by Fortis). In 2006, approximately 50% of gas volumes and revenues associated with the Kerr-McGee acquisition were sold under this legacy contract. This contract is expected to be terminated in March 2007, with the associated volumes being integrated into the Company marketing operations. Crude Oil, Condensate and NGLs Anadarko crude oil, condensate and NGLs revenues are derived from production in the U.S., Algeria and other international areas. Most of the Company U.S. crude oil and NGLs production is sold under 30-day evergreen contracts with prices based on market indices and adjusted for location, quality and transportation. Oil from Algeria is sold by tanker as Saharan Blend to customers primarily in the Mediterranean area. Saharan Blend is a high quality crude that provides refiners large quantities of premium products like jet and diesel fuel. Oil from China is sold by tanker as Cao Fei Dian (CFD Blend) to customers primarily in the Far East markets. CFD Blend is a heavy sour crude oil which is sold into both the prime fuels refining market and the heavy fuel oil blend stock market. The Company also purchases and sells third-party produced crude oil, condensate and NGLs in the Company domestic and international market areas. Included in this strategy is the use of contracted NGLs storage facilities and various derivative instruments. Capital Resources and Liquidity Overview Anadarko primary sources of cash during 2006 were the issuance of debt, cash flow from operating activities and divestitures. The Company used cash primarily to fund the acquisitions of Kerr-McGee and Western, to fund its capital spending program, repurchase Anadarko common stock, pay dividends and retire debt as well as preferred stock. Anadarko primary source of cash during 2005 was cash flow from operating activities. The Company used 2005 cash flow primarily to fund its capital spending program, repurchase 46 Table of Contents Index to Financial Statements Anadarko common stock and pay dividends. In addition, the Company used $170 million of cash from the 2004 divestitures to retire debt in 2005. In 2004, the Company completed over $3 billion in various pretax asset sales. The Company used proceeds from these asset sales to reduce debt, repurchase Anadarko common stock and otherwise to have funds available for reinvestment in other strategic options. The Company funded its capital investment programs in 2004 primarily through cash flow from operating activities. Following is a discussion of significant sources and uses of cash flows during the period. Forward looking information related to the Company capital resources and liquidity are discussed in Outlook that follows. Debt At year-end 2006, Anadarko total debt was $23.0 billion compared to total debt of $3.6 billion at year-end 2005 and $3.8 billion at year-end 2004. In August 2006, the Company financed $22.5 billion under a 364-day acquisition facility in order to fund the Kerr-McGee and Western acquisitions and repay a portion of the debt assumed with the acquisitions. The variable-rate facility is based on London Interbank Offered Rate (LIBOR) and had a weighted-average interest rate of approximately 5.80% at December 31, 2006. As of December 31, 2006, the Company has refinanced approximately $6 billion of the acquisition facility with new long-term issuances (discussed below) and repaid $5.5 billion with divestiture proceeds and cash flow from operations. An aggregate principal amount of $2.1 billion of debt assumed in the Kerr-McGee acquisition remains outstanding as of December 31, 2006. In September 2006, the Company issued $5.5 billion senior notes including floating rate notes due 2009, 5.95% notes due 2016, and 6.45% notes due 2036. The net proceeds were used to repay a portion of the acquisition facility. The floating rate notes due 2009 had an average interest rate of approximately 5.76% at December 31, 2006. In October 2006, the Company received $500 million of proceeds from a private offering of Zero Coupon Senior Notes due 2036. The notes were issued with a yield to maturity of 5.24% and the holders have an option to put the notes back to the Company periodically. The net proceeds from the private offering were used to repay a portion of the acquisition facility. The Company had $182 million of commercial paper outstanding at December 31, 2006. During 2006, the Company redeemed for cash an aggregate principal amount of $122 million of debt that was outstanding as of December 31, 2005. Of this amount, $80 million was related to continuing operations. For additional information on the Company debt instruments, such as transactions during the period, years of maturity and interest rates, see Note 8 Debt and Interest Expense of the Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements under Item 8 of this Form 10-K. Cash Flow from Operating Activities Anadarko cash flow from continuing operating activities in 2006 was $5.0 billion compared to $3.5 billion in 2005 and $2.7 billion in 2004. The increase in 2006 cash flow was attributed to the impact of the acquisitions and higher commodity prices, partially offset by higher costs and expenses and slightly lower legacy sales volumes. The increase in 2005 cash flow compared to 2004 was attributed to higher net realized commodity prices, partially offset by lower sales volumes resulting from the 2004 divestitures. Excluding the impact of acquisitions and divestitures, fluctuations in commodity prices have been the primary reason for the Company short-term changes in cash flow from operating activities. Anadarko holds derivative instruments to help manage commodity price risk. Sales volume changes can also impact cash flow in the short-term, but have not been as volatile as commodity prices in prior years. Anadarko long-term cash flow from operating activities is dependent on commodity prices, reserve replacement, the level of costs and expenses required for continued operations and the level of acquisition and divestiture activity. 47 Table of Contents Index to Financial Statements Capital Expenditures The following table shows the Company capital expenditures relating to continuing operations by category. millions 2006 2005 2004 Property acquisitions Development proved $ 14,496 $ 44 $ (1 ) Exploration unproved 13,379 229 135 Development 3,079 1,959 1,919 Exploration 903 588 387 Total oil and gas costs incurred* 31,857 2,820 2,440 Less: Corporate acquisitions (27,491 ) Less: Asset retirement costs (158 ) (29 ) (47 ) Plus: Asset retirement expenditures 25 25 24 Total oil and gas capital expenditures* 4,233 2,816 2,417 Gathering, processing and marketing and other 361 127 93 Total $ 4,594 $ 2,943 $ 2,510 * Oil and gas costs incurred represent capitalized costs related to finding and developing oil and gas reserves. Capital expenditures represent actual cash outlays excluding corporate acquisitions. Anadarko capital spending increased 56% in 2006 compared to 2005. The Company capital spending increased 17% in 2005 compared to 2004. The increase in 2006 resulted primarily from an increase in exploration lease acquisitions, offshore drilling completions, development of the CBM infrastructure and capital expenditures of the acquired companies. The increase in 2005 includes higher exploration costs in the deepwater Gulf of Mexico. Additionally, both periods were impacted by rising service and material costs. The variances in the mix of oil and gas spending reflect the Company available opportunities based on the near-term ranking of projects by net asset value potential. The acquisitions in 2006 relate primarily to Kerr-McGee and Western. The acquisitions in 2005 and 2004 primarily relate to exploratory nonproducing leases. Anadarko participated in a total of 1,537 gross wells in 2006 compared to 688 gross wells in 2005 and 793 gross wells in 2004. The following table provides additional detail of the Company drilling activity in 2006 and 2005.

Common Stock Repurchase Program During 2005, a $2 billion stock buyback program announced in 2004 was completed and an additional $1 billion stock buyback program was authorized in November 2005. Shares may be repurchased either in the open market or through privately negotiated transactions. During 2006 and 2005, Anadarko purchased 2.5 million and 21.6 million shares of common stock for $0.1 billion and $0.9 billion, respectively, under these programs. The repurchase program does not obligate Anadarko to acquire any specific number of shares and may be discontinued at any time. At December 31, 2006, $636 million remained available for stock repurchases under the program authorized in 2005. Dividends In 2006, Anadarko paid $167 million in dividends to its common stockholders (nine cents per share per quarter). In 2005, Anadarko paid $170 million in dividends to its common stockholders (nine cents per share per quarter). In 2004, Anadarko paid $139 million in dividends to its common stockholders (seven cents per share per quarter). Anadarko has paid a dividend to its common stockholders continuously since becoming an independent company in 1986. The amount of future dividends for Anadarko common stock will depend on earnings, financial conditions, capital requirements and other factors, and will be determined by the Board of Directors on a quarterly basis. The covenants in the Company credit agreement provide for a maximum capitalization ratio of 75% debt, exclusive of the effect of any noncash writedowns, until September 30, 2007. After September 30, 2007, the maximum capitalization ratio is 60% debt. As of December 31, 2006, Anadarko capitalization ratio was 61%. The Company amended the credit agreement prior to closing the acquisitions to allow for a higher maximum capitalization ratio covenant to allow the Company to pay dividends consistent with past practices. Although the covenants of the agreement do not specifically restrict the payment of dividends, the Company could be limited in the amount of dividends it could pay in order to stay below the maximum capitalization ratio. Based on these covenants, retained earnings of approximately $7.6 billion were not limited as to the payment of dividends. In 2006, Anadarko also paid $3 million in preferred stock dividends. In 2005 and 2004, the Company paid $5 million in preferred stock dividends. In 2007 preferred stock dividends are expected to be $3 million. Outlook The Company goals include continuing to find or acquire high-margin oil and gas reserves at competitive prices while keeping operating costs at efficient levels. Anadarko completed the acquisitions of Kerr-McGee and Western in August 2006 in two separate all-cash transactions. These transactions required $22.5 billion of capital which was funded through a 364-day acquisition facility that matures in August 2007. The Company announced its intention to repay the borrowings under the acquisition facility with proceeds from asset sales, free cash flow from operations and the potential issuances of equity, debt and bank financing. Anadarko intends to reduce leverage significantly during 2007. In 2006, the Company repaid approximately $1 billion of borrowings with the proceeds received from the sale of the former Kerr-McGee Gulf of Mexico shelf properties. In addition, the Company issued $5.5 billion of senior notes in the public market in 2006 and also received $500 million from a private offering of senior notes in 2006, with proceeds from both debt issuances applied to the repayment of the acquisition facility. The Company also closed the sale of its wholly-owned subsidiary, Anadarko Canada Corporation, for approximately $4.3 billion pretax and further reduced the borrowings under the facility with after-tax proceeds. As of December 31, 2006, Anadarko had an aggregate principal amount of approximately $11 billion outstanding under the acquisition facility, which matures in August 2007. Anadarko has signed several additional separate and unrelated agreements with various companies for the divestiture of certain non-core properties in the Gulf of Mexico and onshore in the United States for a combined total of approximately $6.5 billion before income taxes. Certain of these agreements have closed and the remaining are expected to close in the first half of 2007. The Company expects total after-tax proceeds from the Canadian sale and the other transactions mentioned above to be about $9 billion. The Company expects to divest certain other assets by the end of 2007, with 49 Table of Contents Index to Financial Statements expected incremental after-tax proceeds totaling between $2 billion and $6 billion. The proceeds from all of these transactions are being used to reduce indebtedness. After the sales are complete, the Company expects proved reserves of the new Anadarko will be about 2.5 billion BOE, only slightly higher than at the beginning of 2006. The goal of the Kerr-McGee and Western acquisitions was to provide for a more economically efficient platform with higher and more consistent growth potential. The new portfolio is expected to be better balanced, with lower-risk U.S. onshore resource plays that help smooth out the volatility inherent in its deepwater Gulf of Mexico and international programs. The Company believes the acquisitions and subsequent portfolio restructuring will have the following key benefits: A lower-risk, more efficient portfolio of core producing properties; A large and high-quality portfolio, which should result in more consistent and predictable reserve and production performance; An expanded leasehold position, which provides access to exploration opportunities worldwide; A substantial inventory of identified prospects, which will help deliver value from the exploratory drilling program over many years to come; and Expanded technical capabilities, combining the exploration, development, project management and operational skill sets of all three companies. The Company currently expects 2007 capital spending to be approximately $4.2 billion. The Company has allocated about 69% capital spending to development activities, 16% to exploration activities, 12% to gas gathering and processing activities and the remaining 3% for capitalized interest, overhead and other items. The Company capital discipline strategy is to set capital activity at levels that are self-funding. Anadarko believes that its expected level of cash flow, and continued adherence to its capital discipline strategy, will be sufficient to fund the Company projected operational program for 2007. If capital expenditures exceed operating cash flow, funds are supplemented as needed by short-term borrowings under commercial paper, money market loans or credit agreement borrowings. To facilitate such borrowings, the Company has in place a $750 million committed credit agreement, which is supplemented by various noncommitted credit lines that may be offered by certain banks from time to time at then-quoted rates. As of December 31, 2006, the Company had no outstanding borrowings under its credit facility. It is the Company policy to limit commercial paper borrowing to levels that are fully supported by unused balances from its committed credit facilities. The Company may choose to refinance certain portions of these short-term borrowings by issuing long-term debt in the public or private debt markets. To facilitate such financings, the Company may sell securities off its shelf registration statement filed with the SEC. The Company continuously monitors its debt position and coordinates its capital expenditure program with expected cash flows and projected debt repayment schedules. The Company will continue to evaluate funding alternatives, including property sales and additional borrowings, to secure funds when needed. For additional information on factors that could impact Anadarko future results of operations, cash flows from operating activities or financial position see Risk Factors under Item 1a of this Form 10-K. Other Developments Algeria Anadarko operations in Algeria have been governed by an Agreement for Exploration and Exploitation of Liquid Hydrocarbons (PSC) that Anadarko Algeria Corporation entered into in October 1989 with Sonatrach, the national oil company of Algeria. In March 2006, Anadarko received from Sonatrach a letter purporting to give notice under the PSC that enactment of law relating to hydrocarbons triggered Sonatrach right under the PSC to renegotiate the PSC in order to re-establish the equilibrium of Anadarko and Sonatrach interests. Anadarko and Sonatrach reached an impasse over whether Sonatrach has a right to renegotiate the PSC based on this new law and have entered into a formal non-binding conciliation process under the terms of the PSC to try to resolve this dispute. At this time, Anadarko is unable to reasonably estimate what the economic impact under the PSC might be if Sonatrach is successful in modifying the PSC. 50 Table of Contents Index to Financial Statements In July 2006, the Algerian parliament approved legislation establishing an exceptional profits tax on foreign companies Algerian oil and gas production. The legislation provides that an exceptional profits tax ranges from 5% to 50% on exceptional profits whenever the monthly price of Brent crude averages over $30 per barrel, applied retroactively to production from August 1, 2006. The July 2006 legislation did not specify all the aspects necessary to quantify the tax liability, but indicated that regulations clarifying the determination of the tax would be issued in the future. In December 2006, implementing regulations were issued and Sonatrach notified the Company as to the applicable regulatory provisions. The applicable regulatory provisions provide that exceptional profits tax is imposed on gross production at rates of taxation ranging from 5% to 50% based on average daily production volumes for each calendar month. Uncertainty exists as to whether the exceptional profits tax will apply to the full value of production or only to the value of production in excess of $30 per barrel. In the fourth quarter of 2006, the Company recorded a $103 million liability for exceptional profits tax, with associated expense reflected in other taxes in the consolidated statement of income. This amount represents the Company estimate of its liability for exceptional profits tax from the law August 1, 2006 effective date through year-end 2006, based on the assumption that the tax applies only to production value in excess of $30 per barrel. If the exceptional profits tax is applied to the full value of production, the Company estimated 2006 liability for exceptional profits tax would be $190 million. The Company is not yet in a position to confirm the probable interpretation of the law, but is continuing to monitor further guidance to determine the law ultimate application to the Company. For 2007, assuming an average oil price of $60 per barrel and application of the exceptional profits tax to production value in excess of $30 per barrel, Anadarko estimated annual production tax expense for the exceptional profits tax would be $225 million. If the exceptional profits tax is applied to the full value of production rather than to the value in excess of $30 per barrel, the estimated annual expense would double. Sonatrach has notified the Company that it will begin collecting current and past exceptional profits tax in March 2007, by retaining 85% of the barrels to which Anadarko is entitled until the Company current and prior period liability for exceptional profits tax has been satisfied. Anadarko currently has 111 million barrels of proved undeveloped reserves in Algeria, the economics of which are sensitive to the exceptional profits tax. Anadarko is reviewing whether these reserves remain economic under existing development plans if the exceptional profits tax is applied to the entire production value. Assuming that the exceptional profits tax applies to the full value of production and this 111 million barrels of existing proved undeveloped Algerian reserves would then become uneconomic, based on the Company analysis, no full-cost ceiling test impairment would have been required at December 31, 2006. In response to the Algerian government imposition of the exceptional profits tax, the Company has notified Sonatrach of its disagreement with the proposed collection of the exceptional profits tax. The Company believes that the PSC provides fiscal stability through several of its provisions. At this time, the Company cannot determine the ultimate outcome of any possible negotiations or any potential recourse to conciliation or arbitration by either side. Venezuela Anadarko operations in Venezuela have been governed by an Operating Service Agreement (OSA) that was entered into in November 1993 with an affiliate of Petroleos de Venezuela, S.A. (PDVSA), the national oil company of Venezuela. Anadarko and its partner in the OSA, Petrobras Energia Venezuela (Petrobras), have conducted their OSA operations through a Venezuelan joint venture in which Petrobras acted as operator. In 2005, the Venezuelan Ministry of Energy and Petroleum announced that all OSAs concluded by PDVSA between 1992 and 1997 were subject to renegotiation. As a result, in October 2006, the OSA was converted into a new operating company, Petroritupano S.A. An affiliate of PDVSA, Corporaci n Venezolana del Petr leo, S.A. (CVP), and PDVSA have a 60% interest, Petrobras has a 22% interest, and Anadarko has an 18% interest in the new company. In October 2006, Anadarko, CVP and Petrobras executed the relevant contracts creating the aforementioned interests in the new company. The OSA terminated automatically with the creation of Petroritupano S.A. For the year ended 2006, Anadarko paid approximately $6 million of Venezuela tax related to an assessment by SENIAT, the Venezuela national tax authority, which included an increase in corporate income tax rates (67.7% for 2001 and 50% for 2002-2004) and approximately $4 million of interest and penalties related to SENIAT tax assessment. 51 Table of Contents Index to Financial Statements With the termination of the OSA in exchange for an 18% interest in the new company, Anadarko began accounting for its interest in the new company using the equity method in the fourth quarter 2006. As a result of this exchange, Anadarko recorded a loss of $178 million in the fourth quarter of 2006. With respect to these assets, Anadarko is currently analyzing its options, including a possible sale. As of December 31, 2006, less than 1% of Anadarko total assets were associated with operations located in Venezuela. Discontinued Operations In November 2006, Anadarko sold its wholly-owned subsidiary, Anadarko Canada Corporation, for approximately $4.3 billion before income taxes. Accordingly, the Canadian oil and gas operations have been classified as discontinued operations in the consolidated statements of income and cash flows and the associated assets and liabilities have been classified as held for sale in the consolidated balance sheets. As of September 30, 2006, operations in Canada had represented approximately 6% of Anadarko total assets and 9% of third quarter 2006 sales volumes. The following table summarizes selected data pertaining to discontinued operations. millions except per share amounts 2006 2005 2004 Revenues $ 717 $ 913 $ 955 Income from discontinued operations $ 330 $ 490 $ 377 Gain on disposition of discontinued operations 2,263 Income from discontinued operations before income taxes 2,593 490 377 Income tax expense 535 92 72 Income from discontinued operations, net of taxes $ 2,058 $ 398 $ 305 Earnings per common share from discontinued operations diluted $ 4.44 $ 0.84 $ 0.60 Annual sales volumes (MMBOE) 17 20 29 Cash flow provided by (used in) operating activities $ (139 ) $ 644 $ 464 Capital expenditures $ 588 $ 494 $ 580 Income from discontinued operations, net of tax, for 2006 increased 417% compared to the same period of 2005 primarily due to the gain on the sale of Canadian operations, a decrease in Canadian tax rates and higher oil prices, partially offset by an increase in Canadian taxes associated with the gain on sale and a decrease in recognized sales volumes as a result of the November 2006 sale. Income tax expense for 2006 includes a $79 million decrease related to Canadian tax rate changes. Income from discontinued operations, net of tax, for 2005 increased 30% compared to the same period of 2004 primarily due to significantly higher commodity prices, partially offset by decreases in sales volumes and costs and expenses associated with Canadian properties sold in late 2004. Under the Company 364-day term loan agreement, the Company is required to use net cash proceeds from significant dispositions to repay debt. Because the Canadian assets are subject to this requirement, approximately $58 million of interest expense related to the portion of debt that was repaid with proceeds from the sale of the Canadian operations is included in results of discontinued operations for 2006. 52 Table of Contents Index to Financial Statements Obligations and Commitments Following is a summary of the Company obligations as of December 31, 2006: Obligations by Period millions 1 Year 2-3 Years 4-5 Years Later Years Total Total debt Principal $ 11,475 $ 2,449 $ 1,625 $ 9,284 $ 24,833 Interest 1,111 1,367 1,120 8,255 11,853 Operating leases Drilling rig commitments 1,126 2,456 712 105 4,399 Production platforms 85 156 123 408 772 Other 86 137 83 38 344 Asset retirement obligations 37 61 55 897 1,050 Gathering, processing and marketing activities 211 312 206 293 1,022 Oil and gas activities 316 146 48 510 Operating Leases Operating lease obligations include several drilling rig commitments that qualify as operating leases. During 2006 and 2005, Anadarko entered into various agreements to secure the necessary drilling rigs to execute its drilling strategy over several years. A review of the Company worldwide deepwater drilling inventory, along with the tightening deepwater and onshore rig market, led Anadarko to secure the drilling rigs it needs to execute its strategy. Nearly two-thirds of the proposed contracted rig time is intended to delineate and develop discoveries, with the remainder for high potential exploration. The Company believes these rig-contracting efforts offer compelling economics and facilitate its drilling strategy. Lease payments for these drilling rig commitments, net of amounts billed to partners, will be capitalized as a component of oil and gas properties. The Company also has $1.1 billion in commitments under noncancelable operating lease agreements for production platforms and equipment, buildings, facilities and aircraft. For additional information see Note 20 Commitments of the Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements under Item 8 of this Form 10-K. Gathering, Processing and Marketing Activities Anadarko has entered into various transportation, storage and purchase agreements in order to access markets and provide flexibility for the sale of its natural gas and crude oil in certain areas. The above table includes amounts related to these commitments. During 2006, the precedent agreements the Company had entered to secure transportation of natural gas upon completion of its Bear Head LNG facility were terminated. Oil and Gas Activities As is common in the oil and gas industry, Anadarko has various long-term contractual commitments pertaining to exploration, development and production activities, which extend beyond the 2007 budget. The Company has work-related commitments for, among other things, drilling wells, obtaining and processing seismic and fulfilling rig commitments. The preceding table includes long-term drilling and work-related commitments of $510 million, comprised of $335 million in the United States, $16 million in Algeria and $159 million in other international locations. The Company also routinely enters into short-term commitments, which are included in the Company 2007 capital budget of $4.2 billion; therefore, these commitments are not included in the preceding table. 53 Table of Contents Index to Financial Statements Marketing and Trading Contracts The following tables provide information as of December 31, 2006 regarding the Company marketing and trading portfolio of physical delivery and financially settled derivative instruments. The other changes in fair value in the table below relate primarily to contracts assumed in the 2006 acquisitions. See Critical Accounting Policies and Estimates for an explanation of how the fair value for derivatives is calculated. millions Marketing and Trading Fair value of contracts outstanding as of December 31, 2005 assets (liabilities) $ 3 Contracts realized or otherwise settled during 2006 (2 ) Fair value of new contracts when entered into during 2006 2 Other changes in fair value 56 Fair value of contracts outstanding as of December 31, 2006 assets (liabilities) $ 59 Fair Value of Contracts as of December 31, 2006 Assets (Liabilities) millions Maturity less than 1 Year Maturity 1-3 Years Maturity 4-5 Years Maturity in excess of 5 Years Total Marketing and Trading Prices actively quoted $ 57 $ 2 $ $ $ 59 Both exchange and over-the-counter traded derivative instruments are subject to margin deposit requirements. Margin deposits are required of the Company whenever its unrealized losses with a counterparty exceed predetermined credit limits. Given the Company price risk management position and price volatility, the Company may be required from time to time to advance cash to its counterparties in order to satisfy these margin deposit requirements. During 2006, the Company margin deposit requirements have ranged from zero to $64 million. The Company had margin deposits of $31 million outstanding at December 31, 2006. Other In 2006, including discontinued operations, the Company made contributions of $59 million to its funded pension plans, $86 million to its unfunded pension plans and $14 million to its unfunded other postretirement benefit plans. Contributions to the funded plans increase the plan assets while contributions to unfunded plans are used for current benefit payments. In 2007, the Company expects to contribute $13 million to its funded pension plans, $50 million to its unfunded pension plans and $21 million to its unfunded other postretirement benefit plans. Future contributions to funded pension plans will be affected by actuarial assumptions, market performance and individual year funding decisions. The Company is unable to accurately predict what contribution levels will be required beyond 2007 for the pension plans; however, they are expected to be at levels similar to those made in 2006. The Company expects future payments for other postretirement benefit plans to increase above those made in 2006 due to the assumption of Kerr-McGee plans in August 2006. Anadarko is also subject to various environmental remediation and reclamation obligations arising from federal, state and local laws and regulations. As of December 31, 2006, the Company balance sheet included an $87 million liability for remediation and reclamation obligations, most of which were incurred by companies that Anadarko has acquired. The Company continually monitors the liability recorded and the remediation and reclamation process, and believes the amount recorded is appropriate. For additional information on contracts, obligations and arrangements the Company enters into from time to time, see Note 8 Debt and Interest Expense, Note 9 Financial Instruments, Note 10 Sale of Future Hard Minerals Royalty Revenues, Note 11 Asset Retirement Obligations, Note 21 Pension Plans, Other Postretirement Benefits and Employee Savings Plans and Note 22 Contingencies of the Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements under Item 8 of this Form 10-K. 54 Table of Contents Index to Financial Statements Critical Accounting Policies and Estimates Financial Statements and Use of Estimates In preparing financial statements in accordance with generally accepted accounting principles, management makes informed judgments and estimates that affect the reported amounts of assets and liabilities as of the date of the financial statements and affect the reported amounts of revenues and expenses during the reporting period. On an ongoing basis, management reviews its estimates, including those related to determination of proved reserves, litigation, environmental liabilities, income taxes and fair values. In 2006, significant estimates were also involved in accounting for business combinations. Changes in facts and circumstances may result in revised estimates and actual results may differ from these estimates. Management considers the following to be its most critical accounting policies and estimates that involve judgment and discusses the selection and development of these policies and estimates with the Company Audit Committee. Business Combinations Accounting for the acquisition of a business requires the allocation of the purchase price to the various assets and liabilities of the acquired business and recording deferred taxes for any differences between the allocated values and tax basis of assets and liabilities. Any excess of the purchase price over the amounts assigned to assets and liabilities is recorded as goodwill. In connection with Anadarko August 2006 acquisitions of Kerr-McGee and Western, the Company recorded goodwill for the excess of the purchase price over the value assigned to individual assets acquired and liabilities assumed. The Company fair value estimates for the 2006 acquisitions are subject to change as additional information becomes available and is assessed by Anadarko. Purchase Price Allocation The purchase price allocation is accomplished by recording the asset or liability at its estimated fair value. Anadarko uses all available information to make these fair value determinations, including information commonly considered by the Company engineers in valuing individual oil and gas properties and sales prices for similar assets. Estimated deferred taxes are based on available information concerning the tax basis of the acquired company assets and liabilities and carryforwards at the merger date, although such estimates may change in the future as additional information becomes known. The amount of goodwill recorded in any particular business combination can vary significantly depending upon the values attributed to assets acquired and liabilities assumed relative to the total acquisition cost. Goodwill The Company is required to assess goodwill for impairment annually, or more often as circumstances warrant. The first step of that process is to compare the fair value of the reporting unit to which goodwill has been assigned to the carrying amount of the associated net assets and goodwill. If the estimated fair value is greater than the carrying amount of the reporting unit, then no impairment loss is required. The Company completed its most recent annual goodwill impairment test, with no impairment indicated. Although Anadarko cannot predict when or if goodwill will be impaired in the future, impairment charges may occur if we are unable to replace the value of our depleting asset base or if other adverse events (for example, lower sustained oil and gas prices) reduce the fair value of the associated reporting unit. Proved Reserves Proved oil and gas reserves, as defined by SEC Regulation S-X Rule 4-10(a) (2i), (2ii), (2iii), (3) and (4), are the estimated quantities of crude oil, natural gas and NGLs that geological and engineering data demonstrate with reasonable certainty to be recoverable in future years from known reservoirs under existing economic and operating conditions, i.e., prices and costs as of the date the estimate is made. Prices include consideration of changes in existing prices provided only by contractual arrangements, but not on escalations based upon future conditions. The Company estimates of proved reserves are made using available geological and reservoir data as well as production performance data. These estimates are reviewed annually and revised, either upward or downward, as warranted by additional data. Revisions are necessary due to changes in, among other things, reservoir performance, prices, economic conditions and governmental restrictions. Decreases in prices, for example, may cause a reduction in some proved reserves due to reaching economic limits sooner. A material change in the estimated volumes of reserves could have an impact on the DD&A rate calculation and the financial statements. 55 Table of Contents Index to Financial Statements Properties and Equipment The Company uses the full cost method of accounting for exploration and development activities as defined by the SEC. Under this method of accounting, the costs of unsuccessful, as well as successful, exploration and development activities are capitalized as properties and equipment. This includes any internal costs that are directly related to exploration and development activities but does not include any costs related to production, general corporate overhead or similar activities. Gain or loss on the sale or other disposition of oil and gas properties is not recognized, unless the gain or loss would significantly alter the relationship between capitalized costs and proved reserves of oil and natural gas attributable to a country. The application of the full cost method of accounting for oil and gas properties generally results in higher capitalized costs and higher DD&A rates compared to the successful efforts method of accounting for oil and gas properties. Management is currently assessing the potential effects of converting from the full cost method to the successful efforts method of accounting for oil and gas activities. Should the Company decide to change accounting methods, financial statements for prior periods will be restated to reflect the results and balances that would have been reported had it been following the successful efforts method of accounting. Asset Retirement Obligation The initial estimated retirement obligation of properties is recognized as a liability, with an associated increase in properties and equipment. Accretion expense is recognized over the estimated productive life of the related assets. If the fair value of the estimated asset retirement obligation changes, an adjustment is recorded to both the asset retirement obligation and the asset retirement cost. Revisions in estimated liabilities can result from revisions of estimated inflation rates, escalating retirement costs and changes in the estimated timing of settling asset retirement obligations. Costs Excluded Properties and equipment include costs that are excluded from costs being depreciated or amortized. Oil and gas costs excluded represent investments in unproved properties and major development projects in which the Company owns a direct interest. These unproved property costs include nonproducing leasehold, geological and geophysical costs associated with leasehold or drilling interests and exploration drilling costs. Anadarko excludes these costs on a country-by-country basis until proved reserves are found or until it is determined that the costs are impaired. All costs excluded are reviewed at least quarterly to determine if impairment has occurred. The amount of any impairment is transferred to the capitalized costs being amortized (the DD&A pool) or a charge is made against earnings for those international operations where a reserve base has not yet been established. Impairments transferred to the DD&A pool increase the DD&A rate for that country. For international operations where a reserve base has not yet been established, an impairment requiring a charge to earnings may be indicated through evaluation of drilling results, relinquishing drilling rights or other information. Costs excluded for oil and gas properties are generally classified and evaluated as significant or individually insignificant properties. Significant properties are individually evaluated by the Company exploration and engineering staff. Nonproducing leases and geological and geophysical costs are transferred to the DD&A pool based on the progress of the Company exploration program. Exploration drilling costs are transferred to the DD&A pool upon the determination of whether proved reserves can be assigned to the properties, which is generally based on drilling results. The Company has a 10- to 12-year exploration and evaluation program for the Land Grant acreage. Costs are transferred to the DD&A pool as they are evaluated. The Land Grant mineral interests (both working and royalty interests) are owned by the Company in perpetuity. Insignificant properties are aggregated and nonproducing leases, along with related geological and geophysical costs, are transferred to the DD&A pool over a three- to five-year period based on the lease term. Exploration costs are transferred to the DD&A pool upon the determination of whether proved reserves can be assigned to the properties. Other costs excluded from depreciation represent major construction projects that are in progress. Derivative Instruments Current accounting rules require that all derivative instruments, other than those that meet specific exclusions, be recorded at fair value. Quoted market prices are the best evidence of fair value. If quotations are not available, management best estimate of fair value is based on the quoted market price of derivatives with similar characteristics or on valuation techniques. 56 Table of Contents Index to Financial Statements The Company derivative instruments are either exchange traded or transacted in an over-the-counter market. Valuation is determined by reference to readily available public data. Option fair values are based on the Black-Scholes option pricing model and verified against the applicable counterparty fair values. Derivative accounting rules require that fair value changes of derivative instruments that do not qualify for hedge accounting be reported in current period earnings, rather than in the period the derivatives are settled and/or the hedged transaction is settled. This can result in significant earnings volatility. Through the end of 2006, Anadarko applied hedge accounting to some of its commodity derivatives. Derivative accounting rules are complex, subject to interpretation in their application and interpretative guidance continues to evolve. As a result of this accounting risk, effective January 1, 2007, Anadarko discontinued hedge accounting on all existing commodity and interest rate derivatives. Such a change will not affect Anadarko reported financial position or cash flows and will not require adjustments to previously reported financial statements. Benefit Plan Obligations The Company has defined benefit pension plans and supplemental pension plans that are noncontributory and a foreign contributory defined benefit pension plan. The Company also provides certain health care and life insurance benefits for retired employees. Determination of the projected benefit obligations for the Company defined benefit pension and postretirement plans is important to the recorded amounts for such obligations on the balance sheet and to the amount of benefit expense in the income statement. This also impacts the Company decisions for amounts contributed into the plans. Accounting for pension and other postretirement benefit obligations involves numerous assumptions, the most significant of which relate to discount rate for measuring the present value of future plan obligations; expected long-term rates of return on plan assets; rate of future increases in compensation levels; and health care cost projections. Anadarko develops demographics and utilizes the work of third-party actuaries to assist in the measurement of these obligations. Discount rate The discount rate assumption used by the Company is meant to reflect the interest rate at which the pension and other postretirement obligations could effectively be settled on the measurement date. The Company currently uses a yield curve analysis, for a majority of the plans, to support the discount rate assumption. This analysis involves the creation of a hypothetical Aa spot yield curve represented by a series of high-quality, non-callable, marketable bonds, then discounts the projected cash flows from each plan at interest rates on the created curve specifically applicable to the timing of each respective cash flow. The present values of the cash flows are then accumulated, and a weighted-average discount rate is calculated by imputing the single discount rate that equates to the total present value of the cash flows. The consolidated discount rate assumption is determined by evaluation of the weighted-average discount rates determined for each of the Company significant pension and postretirement plans. The weighted-average discount rate assumption used by the Company as of December 31, 2006 was 5.75%. Expected long-term rate of return The expected long-term rate of return on assets assumption was determined using the year-end 2006 pension investment balances by category and projected target asset allocations for 2007. The expected return for each of these categories was determined by using capital market projections provided by the Company external pension consultants, with consideration of actual five-year performance statistics for investments in place. The weighted-average expected long-term rate of return on plan assets assumption used by the Company as of December 31, 2006 was 7.75%. Rate of compensation increases The Company determines this assumption based on its long-term plans for compensation increases specific to employee groups covered and expected economic conditions. The assumed rate of salary increases includes the effects of merit increases, promotions and general inflation. The weighted-average rate of increase in long-term compensation levels assumption used by the Company as of December 31, 2006 was 5.0%. Health care cost trend rate The health care cost trend assumptions are developed based on historical cost data, the near-term outlook and an assessment of likely long-term trends. For year-end 2006 measurement purposes, the Company used separate assumptions of cost increase rates for medical, prescription drugs and dental benefits 57 Table of Contents Index to Financial Statements covered by the plans. An 8% annual rate of increase in the per capita cost of covered medical benefits was assumed for 2006, decreasing gradually to 5% in 2015 and later years. For prescription drug benefits, a rate of increase of 13% in the per capita cost was assumed for 2006, decreasing gradually to 5% in 2015 and later years. For dental care costs, the Company assumed a flat rate of increase of 5%. Environmental Obligations and Other Contingencies Management makes judgments and estimates in accordance with applicable accounting rules when it establishes reserves for environmental remediation, litigation and other contingent matters. Provisions for such matters are charged to expense when it is probable that a liability has been incurred and reasonable estimates of the liability can be made. Estimates of environmental liabilities are based on a variety of matters, including, but not limited to, the stage of investigation, the stage of the remedial design, evaluation of existing remediation technologies, and presently enacted laws and regulations. In future periods, a number of factors could significantly change the Company estimate of environmental remediation costs, such as changes in laws and regulations, or changes in their interpretation or administration, revisions to the remedial design, unanticipated construction problems, identification of additional areas or volumes of contaminated soil and groundwater, and changes in costs of labor, equipment and technology. Consequently, it is not possible for management to reliably estimate the amount and timing of all future expenditures related to environmental or other contingent matters and actual costs may vary significantly from the Company estimates. The Company in-house legal counsel and environmental personnel regularly assess these contingent liabilities and, in certain circumstances, outside legal counsel or consultants are utilized. Income Taxes The amount of income taxes recorded by the Company requires the interpretation of complex rules and regulations of various taxing jurisdictions throughout the world. The Company has recognized deferred tax assets and liabilities for all significant temporary differences, operating losses and tax credit carryforwards. The Company routinely assesses the realizability of its deferred tax assets and reduces such assets by a valuation allowance if it is more likely than not that some portion or all of the deferred tax assets will not be realized. The Company routinely assesses potential tax contingencies and, if required, establishes accruals for such contingencies. The accruals for deferred tax assets and liabilities are subject to a significant amount of judgment by Company management and are reviewed and adjusted routinely based on changes in facts and circumstances. Although Company management believes its tax accruals are adequate, material changes in these accruals may occur in the future, based on the progress of ongoing tax audits, changes in legislation and resolution of pending tax matters. Recent Accounting Developments New Accounting Principles Financial Accounting Standards Board Interpretation No. 48 (FIN 48), Accounting for Uncertainty in Income Taxes an Interpretation of FASB Statement No. 109, was issued in 2006 and became effective January 1, 2007 for Anadarko. FIN 48 defines the criteria an individual tax position must meet for any part of the benefit of that position to be recognized in the financial statements. FIN 48 also provides guidance, among other things, on the measurement of the income tax benefit associated with uncertain tax positions, de-recognition, classification, interest and penalties and financial statement disclosures. In light of the acquisitions of Kerr-McGee and Western in 2006, the Company is currently evaluating the potential effects of adopting FIN 48 on its financial statements. The Company cannot reasonably determine the impact of FIN 48 on its financial statements at this time, but will complete its analysis during the first quarter of 2007. In September 2006, the FASB issued Statement of Financial Accounting Standard (SFAS) No. 157, Fair Value Measurements. SFAS No. 157 defines fair value, establishes a framework for measuring fair value and expands disclosure requirements for fair value measurements. SFAS No. 157 does not require new fair value measurements. Rather, its provisions will apply when fair value measurements are performed under other accounting pronouncements. SFAS No. 157 is effective for Anadarko in the first quarter of 2008. The Company is currently evaluating the effects of adoption on its financial statements. 58 Table of Contents Index to Financial Statements
