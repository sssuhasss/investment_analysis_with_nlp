Item 7. Management Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations The following discussion should be read together with the Consolidated Financial Statements and the Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements , which are included in this report in Item 8, and the information set forth in Risk Factors under Item 1A. Unless the context otherwise requires, the terms Anadarko and Company refer to Anadarko Petroleum Corporation and its consolidated subsidiaries. OVERVIEW Anadarko achieved its key operational objectives in 2010 by increasing sales volumes by approximately 7% year-over-year, reducing oil and gas operating expenses per unit by approximately 9% year-over-year, and adding 359 million barrels of oil equivalent (BOE) of proved reserves. Additionally, the Company continued offshore exploration and appraisal drilling success with an approximate 75% success rate and achieved first oil at the Jubilee field offshore Ghana in 3.5 years following discovery. Anadarko ended 2010 with approximately $3.7 billion cash on hand and retains the availability of its undrawn five-year $5.0 billion senior secured revolving credit facility (the $5.0 billion Facility) less $377 million in outstanding letter of credit supported by the $5.0 billion Facility, as well as additional access to credit and capital markets as needed. Management believes that the Company cash on hand, available borrowing capacity and cash flows from operations position the Company to satisfy its operational objectives and capital commitments. Mission and Strategy Anadarko mission is to deliver a competitive and sustainable rate of return to shareholders by exploring for, acquiring and developing oil and natural-gas resources vital to the world health and welfare. Anadarko employs the following strategy to achieve this mission: identify and commercialize resources; explore in high-potential, proven basins; employ a global business development approach; and ensure financial discipline and flexibility. Developing a portfolio of primarily unconventional resources provides the Company a stable base of capital-efficient, predictable and repeatable development opportunities which, in turn, positions the Company for consistent growth at competitive rates. Exploring in high-potential, proven and emerging basins worldwide provides the Company with growth opportunities. Anadarko exploration success, which includes 17 offshore discoveries in the last two years, has created value by expanding its future resource potential, while providing the flexibility to manage risk by monetizing discoveries. Anadarko global business development approach transfers core skills across the globe to assist in the discovery and development of world-class resources that are accretive to the Company performance. These resources help form an optimized global portfolio where both surface and subsurface risks are actively managed. A strong balance sheet is essential for the development of the Company assets, and Anadarko is committed to disciplined investments in its businesses to manage through commodity price cycles. Maintaining financial discipline enables the Company to capitalize on the flexibility of its global portfolio, while allowing the Company to pursue new strategic growth opportunities. 49 Table of Contents Operating Highlights Significant 2010 operating highlights include the following: Deepwater Horizon Events In April 2010, the Macondo well in the Gulf of Mexico, in which Anadarko holds a 25% non-operating leasehold interest, discovered hydrocarbon accumulations. During suspension operations, the well blew out, an explosion occurred on the Deepwater Horizon drilling rig, and the drilling rig sank, resulting in the release of hydrocarbons into the Gulf of Mexico. Eleven people lost their lives in the explosion and subsequent fire, and others sustained personal injuries. In September 2010, the Macondo well was permanently plugged. Refer to Note 2 Deepwater Horizon Events in the Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements under Item 8 of this Form 10-K for discussion and analysis of these events. Deepwater Drilling Moratorium and Other Related Matters Anadarko ceased all drilling operations in the Gulf of Mexico in accordance with the deepwater drilling moratoria (collectively, the Moratorium), which resulted in the suspension of operations of two operated deepwater wells (Lucius and Nansen) and one non-operated deepwater well (Vito). The Moratorium was lifted October 12, 2010, but the Bureau of Ocean Energy Management, Regulation and Enforcement (BOEMRE) has not approved new drilling permits. Anadarko is currently positioned to resume exploration and development drilling operations in the Gulf of Mexico, pending approvals of drilling permits and exploration and oil spill-response plans. See Note 15 Contingencies Deepwater Drilling Moratorium and Other Related Matters in the Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements under Item 8 of this Form 10-K for additional information on the Moratorium. United States Onshore The Company reallocated 7% of total 2010 budgeted capital expenditures from the Gulf of Mexico and redirected onshore United States capital expenditures to liquids-rich areas of the portfolio, including Eagleford, Bone Spring, Wattenberg and Greater Natural Buttes. The Company Rocky Mountains Region (Rockies) achieved total-year sales volumes of 276 thousand barrels of oil equivalent per day (MBOE/d), representing an 11% increase over 2009. The Company Southern and Appalachia Region achieved total-year sales volumes of 124 MBOE/d, representing a 7% increase over 2009. The Company entered into a joint-venture agreement that requires a third-party joint-venture partner to fund up to $1.5 billion of Anadarko share of future acquisition, drilling, completion, equipment and other capital expenditures to earn a 32.5% interest in Anadarko Marcellus shale assets, primarily located in north-central Pennsylvania. The Company acquired more than 80,000 net acres in the Maverick basin of southwest Texas for $93 million and increased its working interest in these properties to 75%. Gulf of Mexico The Company Gulf of Mexico total-year sales volumes were 155 MBOE/d, representing a 2% increase from 2009. The Company drilled successful sidetrack appraisal wells in the Gulf of Mexico at Lucius (50% working interest) and Vito (20% working interest). 50 Table of Contents International The Company drilled seven successful exploration wells with a 54% discovery rate. These wells included three in Mozambique, and one in each of Ghana, Indonesia, Sierra Leone and Brazil. The Company drilled five appraisal wells, four in Ghana and one in Brazil, with a 100% success rate. The Company and its partners took delivery and completed installation and commissioning of the floating production, storage and offloading vessel (FPSO) and achieved first oil at the Ghana Jubilee field in late 2010 on budget and 3.5 years following discovery. Financial Highlights Significant 2010 financial highlights include the following: Anadarko income from continuing operations attributable to common stockholders for 2010 totaled $761 million compared to a loss of $135 million in 2009. The Company generated $5.2 billion of cash flows from operations compared to $3.9 billion in 2009 and ended the year with $3.7 billion of cash on hand. To manage its liquidity and the term structure of its debt, the Company raised $2.7 billion of cash in the public debt markets, and repaid $3.0 billion of aggregate principal amount of debt scheduled to mature in 2011 and 2012, reducing scheduled 2011 and 2012 debt maturities. The Company replaced its $1.3 billion revolving credit agreement scheduled to mature in 2013 with the $5.0 billion Facility maturing in 2015, which was undrawn at December 31, 2010. 51 Table of Contents The following discussion pertains to Anadarko financial condition, results of operations and changes in financial condition. Unless noted otherwise, the following information relates to the continuing operations and any increases or decreases for the year ended December 31, 2010 refer to the comparison of the year ended December 31, 2010, to the year ended December 31, 2009. Similarly, any increases or decreases for the year ended December 31, 2009 refer to the comparison of the year ended December 31, 2009, to the year ended December 31, 2008. The primary factors that affect the Company results of operations include, among other things, commodity prices for natural gas, crude oil and natural gas liquids (NGLs), sales volumes, the Company ability to discover additional oil and natural-gas reserves, the cost of finding such reserves, and operating costs.

FINANCIAL RESULTS Income (Loss) from Continuing Operations Attributable to Common Stockholders Anadarko income from continuing operations attributable to common stockholders for 2010 totaled $761 million, or $1.52 per share (diluted), compared to a loss from continuing operations attributable to common stockholders for 2009 of $135 million, or $0.28 per share (diluted). Anadarko income from continuing operations attributable to common stockholders in 2008 was $3.2 billion, or $6.78 per share (diluted). 52 Table of Contents Sales Revenues, Volumes and Prices millions except percentages 2010 Inc/(Dec) vs. 2009 2009 Inc/(Dec) vs. 2008 2008 Natural-gas sales $ 3,420 17 % $ 2,924 (49 )% $ 5,770 Oil and condensate sales 5,592 39 4,022 (37 ) 6,425 Natural-gas liquids sales 997 86 536 (33 ) 802 Total $ 10,009 34 $ 7,482 (42 ) $ 12,997 Anadarko sales revenues for the year ended December 31, 2010, increased primarily due to higher commodity prices and increased production volumes, while sales revenues for the year ended December 31, 2009, decreased primarily due to lower commodity prices partially offset by higher production volumes, as follows: millions Natural Gas Oil and Condensate NGLs Total 2008 sales revenues $ 5,770 $ 6,425 $ 802 $ 12,997 Changes associated with sales volumes 454 155 154 763 Changes associated with prices (3,300 ) (2,558 ) (420 ) (6,278 ) 2009 sales revenues $ 2,924 $ 4,022 $ 536 $ 7,482 Changes associated with sales volumes 72 286 192 550 Changes associated with prices 424 1,284 269 1,977 2010 sales revenues $ 3,420 $ 5,592 $ 997 $ 10,009 The following table provides Anadarko sales volumes for the years ended December 31, 2010, 2009 and 2008. 2010 Inc/(Dec) vs. 2009 2009 Inc/(Dec) vs. 2008 2008 Barrels of Oil Equivalent (MMBOE except percentages) United States 209 7 % 196 9 % 179 International 26 7 24 (9 ) 27 Total 235 7 220 7 206 Barrels of Oil Equivalent per Day (MBOE/d except percentages) United States 572 7 % 537 9 % 489 International 71 7 67 (9 ) 74 Total 643 7 604 7 563 Sales volumes represent actual production volumes adjusted for changes in commodity inventories. Anadarko employs marketing strategies to minimize market-related shut-ins, maximize realized prices, and manage credit-risk exposure. For additional information, see Other (Income) Expense (Gains) Losses on Commodity Derivatives, net . Production of natural gas, crude oil and NGLs is usually not affected by seasonal swings in demand. 53 Table of Contents Natural-Gas Sales Volumes, Average Prices and Revenues 2010 Inc/(Dec) vs. 2009 2009 Inc/(Dec) vs. 2008 2008 United States Sales volumes Bcf 829 2 % 809 8 % 750 MMcf/d 2,272 2 2,217 8 2,049 Price per Mcf $ 4.12 14 $ 3.61 (53 ) $ 7.69 Natural-gas sales revenues (millions) $ 3,420 17 $ 2,924 (49 ) $ 5,770 Bcf billion cubic feet MMcf/d million cubic feet per day The Company daily natural-gas sales volumes increased 55 MMcf/d for the year ended December 31, 2010, primarily due to increased production in the Rockies of 61 MMcf/d, resulting from increased drilling in Greater Natural Buttes and the Greater Green River basins, as well as increased production in the Southern and Appalachia Region of 12 MMcf/d, associated with increased drilling in the Maverick basin, Haynesville shale and Marcellus shale. Increased natural-gas sales volumes were partially offset by natural production declines in the Gulf of Mexico of 18 MMcf/d. The Company daily natural-gas sales volumes increased 168 MMcf/d for the year ended December 31, 2009, primarily due to increased production in the Rockies of 138 MMcf/d due to positive results from dewatering coalbed methane wells and higher production uptime due to favorable weather. An increase in production in the Gulf of Mexico of 54 MMcf/d related to favorable weather conditions as compared to hurricane-related downtime experienced during 2008. Also, runtime at Independence Hub increased during 2009 as compared to 2008 when export pipeline repair work resulted in downtime. These increases in natural-gas production were partially offset by a 24 MMcf/d decrease in the Southern and Appalachia Region resulting from natural production declines experienced while drilling programs were shifted from established fields to emerging shale plays. The average natural-gas price Anadarko received increased for the year ended December 31, 2010, primarily due to an increase in demand. Anadarko average natural-gas price decreased substantially for the year ended December 31, 2009, primarily because of higher year-over-year U.S. natural-gas production and storage volumes coupled with lower United States demand for natural gas, triggered by the economic downturn in the United States. 54 Table of Contents Crude-Oil and Condensate Sales Volumes, Average Prices and Revenues 2010 Inc/(Dec) vs. 2009 2009 Inc/(Dec) vs. 2008 2008 United States Sales volumes MMBbls 48 7 % 44 10 % 40 MBbls/d 130 7 120 10 108 Price per barrel $ 74.96 28 $ 58.56 (39 ) $ 96.20 International Sales volumes MMBbls 26 7 24 (9 ) 27 MBbls/d 71 7 67 (9 ) 74 Price per barrel $ 78.52 33 $ 59.01 (38 ) $ 95.83 Total Sales volumes MMBbls 74 7 68 2 67 MBbls/d 201 7 187 2 182 Total price per barrel $ 76.22 30 $ 58.72 (39 ) $ 96.05 Oil and condensate sales revenues (millions) $ 5,592 39 $ 4,022 (37 ) $ 6,425 MMBbls million barrels MBbls/d thousand barrels per day Anadarko daily crude-oil and condensate sales volumes increased 14 MBbls/d for the year ended December 31, 2010. This increase was partially due to higher crude-oil sales volumes of 5 MBbls/d in the Gulf of Mexico as completion of repairs to third-party downstream infrastructure that was damaged during the 2008 hurricane season occurred during the third quarter of 2009. In addition, crude-oil sales volumes increased 4 MBbls/d in the Southern and Appalachia Region due to a shift in focus from drilling in dry-gas areas to drilling in liquids-rich areas and 3 MBbls/d in the Rockies due to a full year of production efficiencies related to an oil pipeline that was placed in service in mid-2009, as well as a shift in focus to liquids-rich areas. Also, Algerian crude-oil sales volumes increased 3 MBbls/d primarily due to the timing of cargo liftings. Anadarko daily crude-oil and condensate sales volumes increased 5 MBbls/d for the year ended December 31, 2009, primarily due to higher crude-oil sales volumes of 8 MBbls/d in the Gulf of Mexico and 3 MBbls/d in the Rockies. The increase in the Gulf of Mexico results from additional production that came online during the fourth quarter of 2008, and favorable weather conditions as compared to 2008, which was impacted by export pipeline repair work and hurricane-related disruptions. The increase in the Rockies relates to production efficiencies from an oil pipeline that was placed into service in mid-2009. These increases were offset by lower Algerian crude-oil sales volumes of 6 MBbls/d due to the timing of cargo liftings and variances in the Organization of Petroleum Exporting Countries (OPEC) quotas. The average crude-oil price Anadarko received increased for the year ended December 31, 2010, as a result of increased global demand. Anadarko average crude-oil price decreased for the year ended December 31, 2009, primarily due to increased spare OPEC production capacity coupled with decreased global demand, particularly in the United States, Europe and Japan as a result of the economic downturn. 55 Table of Contents Natural-Gas Liquids Sales Volumes, Average Prices and Revenues 2010 Inc/(Dec) vs. 2009 2009 Inc/(Dec) vs. 2008 2008 United States Sales volumes MMBbls 23 36 % 17 20 % 14 MBbls/d 63 36 47 20 39 Price per barrel $ 43.07 37 $ 31.42 (44 ) $ 56.11 Natural-gas liquids sales revenues (millions) $ 997 86 $ 536 (33 ) $ 802 NGLs sales represent revenues from the sale of products derived from the processing of Anadarko natural-gas production. The Company daily NGLs sales volumes increased 16 MBbls/d for the year ended December 31, 2010, primarily related to operations in the Rockies where natural-gas production increased, an additional natural-gas processing train was brought online late in the second quarter of 2009, and improved recoveries due to new processing agreements entered into late in 2009. Anadarko daily NGLs sales volumes increased 8 MBbls/d for the year ended December 31, 2009, primarily because of a new processing train placed in service during the second quarter of 2009 at the Chipeta natural-gas processing plant, increased natural-gas production in the Rockies, and improved recoveries in the Southern and Appalachia Region due to new processing agreements in the Ozona area. The average NGLs price increased for the year ended December 31, 2010, primarily due to higher crude-oil prices and sustained global petrochemical demand. For the year ended December 31, 2009, average NGLs prices decreased primarily due to decreased global petrochemical demand as a result of the economic downturn. Gathering, Processing and Marketing Margin millions except percentages 2010 Inc/(Dec) vs. 2009 2009 Inc/(Dec) vs. 2008 2008 Gathering, processing and marketing sales $ 833 14 % $ 728 (33 )% $ 1,082 Gathering, processing and marketing expenses 615 617 (23 ) 800 Margin $ 218 96 $ 111 (61 ) $ 282 For the year ended December 31, 2010, gathering, processing and marketing margin increased $107 million. The increase was primarily due to higher margins associated with natural-gas sales from inventory, an increase in processed NGLs volumes and higher NGLs prices, both of which increased margins under percent-of-proceeds and keep-whole contracts, partially offset by the absence of gas-processing margins associated with assets divested in 2009. For the year ended December 31, 2009, gathering, processing and marketing margin decreased $171 million. The decrease was primarily due to lower market prices for natural gas, NGLs and condensate, which led to reduced gas processing margins, lower margins associated with firm transportation contracts due to price differentials between supply and market areas, and unrealized losses on derivatives related to gas-storage activity, which is seasonal in nature, in that the margin realized on the future sale of stored volumes covered by these derivative instruments is expected to more than offset the recorded unrealized losses. These amounts were partially offset by increases in crude- oil and NGLs marketing margins, which were largely attributable to inventory write-downs to market value that occurred in the fourth quarter of 2008. Gains (Losses) on Divestitures and Other, net Gains on divestitures in 2010 were $29 million and related primarily to the divestiture of onshore United States oil and gas properties. Proceeds from the sale of these properties were $70 million. Gains on divestitures in 2009 were $44 million, primarily related to the sale of oil and gas properties in Qatar. Proceeds from the sale of oil and gas properties and midstream properties in 2009 were $109 million and $67 million, respectively. Gains on divestitures in 2008 were $1.2 billion, primarily related to the divestiture of certain oil and gas properties in Brazil, onshore United States and the Gulf of Mexico. Proceeds from 2008 divestitures were $2.5 billion and were used to reduce debt. 56 Table of Contents In 2008, gains (losses) on divestitures and other, net include a net $82 million ($52 million after tax) reduction related to corrections resulting from the analysis of property records after the adoption of the successful efforts method of accounting. This net amount includes a reduction of $163 million related to 2007. Management concluded that this misstatement was not material relative to 2007 interim and annual results, or to the 2008 periods, and corrected the error in the first quarter of 2008. Reversal of Accrual for DWRRA Dispute In January 2006, the Department of the Interior (DOI) issued an order (the 2006 Order) to Kerr-McGee Oil and Gas Corporation (KMOG), a subsidiary of Kerr-McGee Corporation (Kerr-McGee), to pay oil and gas royalties and accrued interest on KMOG deepwater Gulf of Mexico production associated with eight 1996, 1997 and 2000 leases, for which KMOG considered royalties to be suspended under the Deepwater Royalty Relief Act (DWRRA). KMOG successfully appealed the 2006 Order, and the DOI petition for a writ of certiorari with the United States Supreme Court was denied on October 5, 2009. Based on the U.S. Supreme Court denial of the DOI petition for review by the court, Anadarko reversed its $657 million accrued liability in the third quarter of 2009 for royalties on leases listed in the 2006 order, as well as on similar orders to pay issued in 2008 and 2009, and other deepwater Gulf of Mexico leases with similar price threshold provisions. In addition, the Company reversed its $78 million accrued liability for unpaid interest on these amounts in the third quarter of 2009. Effective October 1, 2009, royalties and interest are no longer being accrued for deepwater Gulf of Mexico leases that have royalties suspended under the DWRRA. For more information on the DWRRA dispute, see Note 15 Contingencies Deepwater Royalty Relief Act in the Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements under Item 8 of this Form 10-K. Costs and Expenses millions except percentages 2010 Inc/(Dec) vs. 2009 2009 Inc/(Dec) vs. 2008 2008 Oil and gas operating $ 830 (3 )% $ 859 (17 )% $ 1,036 Oil and gas transportation and other 816 23 664 7 621 Exploration 974 (12 ) 1,107 (19 ) 1,369 For the year ended December 31, 2010, oil and gas operating expenses decreased primarily due to decreased workover costs of $28 million in the Gulf of Mexico as a result of the Moratorium and subsequent delays in obtaining permits. For the year ended December 31, 2009, oil and gas operating expenses decreased primarily as a result of cost savings programs initiated in response to the reduction in oil prices in 2008 and 2009. Cost savings were achieved through operating efficiencies, deferral of certain workovers and vendor negotiations. These cost savings were realized primarily through lower workover costs and surface maintenance costs of $48 million and $21 million, respectively. Additional reductions were due to lower production handling costs of $54 million, primarily in the Gulf of Mexico due to repair-related pipeline downtime. In 2011, the Company expects to maintain efforts to manage costs more efficiently through its knowledge transfer initiatives and supply chain management negotiations; however, oil and gas operating expense per BOE could increase. Additionally, the costs of doing business in the Gulf of Mexico could increase due to the permit-timing delays and compliance with heightened BOEMRE regulatory requirements. For the year ended December 31, 2010, oil and gas transportation and other expenses increased due to higher gas gathering and transportation costs of $77 million and $45 million, primarily attributable to increased production in the Rockies and the Southern and Appalachia Region, respectively, and the expensing of $27 million of idle drilling rig lease payments and $19 million of rig termination fees incurred in 2010 related to deepwater drilling rigs in the Gulf of Mexico. See Note 15 Contingencies Deepwater Drilling Moratorium and Other Related Matters in the Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements under Item 8 of this Form 10-K for discussion regarding the Company decision to invoke force majeure on certain drilling rigs in the Gulf of Mexico. Partially offsetting this increase in oil and gas transportation and other expenses was $29 million of drilling rig contract termination fees incurred in 2009 as a result of low 2009 commodity prices. For the year ended December 31, 2009, oil and gas transportation and other expenses increased due to incremental transportation fees paid on increasing volumes in the Rockies of $41 million, and $29 million of drilling rig contract termination fees discussed above. These increases were partially offset by a decline in surface owner fees in the Rockies of $21 million due to lower 2009 commodity prices. 57 Table of Contents Exploration expense decreased $133 million for the year ended December 31, 2010, primarily due to a $128 million decline in dry hole expense in the United States, lower termination costs of $15 million in various international locations, and other items, partially offset by higher dry hole expense of $26 million in various other international locations, including Brazil, Ghana and Mozambique. Exploration expense for 2010 includes $46 million related to the Macondo well. Exploration expense decreased by $262 million for the year ended December 31, 2009, primarily due to lower impairments of unproved properties of $205 million and lower geological and geophysical expense of $87 million. The decrease in impairments of unproved properties related primarily to Gulf of Mexico properties partially offset by an increase in unproved property impairments in China due to the drilling of an unsuccessful well with no additional exploration plans. The decrease in geological and geophysical expense was primarily related to seismic data which was acquired and expensed in 2008 for Mozambique and Indonesia. millions except percentages 2010 Inc/(Dec) vs. 2009 2009 Inc/(Dec) vs. 2008 2008 General and administrative $ 982 % $ 983 14 % $ 866 Depreciation, depletion and amortization 3,714 5 3,532 11 3,194 Other taxes 1,068 43 746 (49 ) 1,452 Impairments 216 88 115 (48 ) 223 For the year ended December 31, 2010, general and administrative (G&A) expense decreased due to lower bonus plan expense of $67 million, offset by higher legal and consulting fees of $56 million primarily due to costs associated with the Tronox Incorporated (Tronox) bankruptcy and the Deepwater Horizon events, and higher employee-related costs of $11 million. The Company expects insurance costs to increase in 2011 as a result of higher coverage and related rates resulting from the Deepwater Horizon events that will be in effect for the full year in 2011 versus only part of 2010. In addition, the Company expects employee costs to increase primarily due to increased pension costs associated with changes in discount rates as well as increased headcount. The Company also expects legal expenses to increase in 2011 primarily due to Deepwater Horizon litigation; however, legal expenses related to Tronox are expected to decrease in 2011. See Legal Proceedings under Item 3 of this Form 10-K. For the year ended December 31, 2009, G&A expense increased primarily due to bonus plan expense. The increase was primarily related to a supplemental bonus plan, the payment of which was triggered by the Company total-shareholder-return performance relative to a group of peer companies. The performance resulted in significantly increased market value relative to the peer-group-average performance, and all non-officer employees qualified for prescribed payments under the plan. For the year ended December 31, 2010, depreciation, depletion and amortization (DD&A) increased $182 million primarily due to a $209 million increase attributable to higher production volumes and $89 million associated with depleted fields in the Gulf of Mexico, partially offset by lower DD&A rates attributable to reserve increases in the Marcellus shale and the Maverick basin. For the year ended December 31, 2009, DD&A increased $338 million primarily due to a $237 million increase attributable to higher sales volumes and an $84 million increase attributable to higher DD&A rates that were driven by higher accumulated costs associated with acquiring, finding and developing oil and gas reserves. For the year ended December 31, 2010, other taxes increased $322 million primarily due to higher commodity prices and volumes resulting in increased Algerian exceptional profits tax of $129 million, increased United States production and severance taxes of $118 million, and increased Chinese windfall profits tax of $44 million. In addition, higher assessed property values increased ad valorem taxes by $30 million. For the year ended December 31, 2009, other taxes decreased $706 million primarily due to lower commodity prices, which resulted in lower United States production and severance taxes of $343 million, lower Algerian exceptional profits tax of $269 million, lower Chinese windfall profits tax of $60 million, and lower ad valorem taxes of $32 million. 58 Table of Contents Impairments for the year ended December 31, 2010, included $145 million of oil and gas exploration and production operating segment properties located in the United States. The properties in the United States include $114 million related to a production platform that remains idle with no immediate plan for use, and for which a limited market currently exists. The platform was impaired to its estimated fair value of $25 million. Impairments for the year ended December 31, 2010, also included $61 million ($23 million net of tax) related to the Company investment in Venezuelan assets that was impaired to its estimated fair value. The Company remaining after-tax net investment in these Venezuelan assets is $70 million. Also, for 2010, impairments included $8 million of marketing operating segment impairments related to the impairment of firm transportation contracts and $2 million of midstream operating segment assets. Impairments for the year ended December 31, 2009, related to $86 million of marketing operating segment assets, $22 million of oil and gas exploration and production operating segment properties in the United States and $7 million of midstream operating segment assets. The marketing operating segment impairments related to the impairment of firm transportation contracts, caused by narrowing margins between areas connected by acquired pipelines, and LNG facility-site properties.

Also, for 2010, interest expense included losses on early retirements of debt of $86 million, resulting from the repurchase of $1.4 billion aggregate principal amount of senior notes during 2010. These increases were partially offset by increases in capitalized interest of $59 million due to higher construction-in-progress balances related to long-term capital projects. Future interest expense is expected to increase due to amortization of issuance costs related to the $5.0 billion Facility and capital lease obligations. Anadarko interest expense decreased for the year ended December 31, 2009, primarily due to the reversal of $78 million of previously accrued interest expense related to the DWRRA dispute, lower interest expense of $70 million due to the partial retirement of the Midstream Subsidiary Note and lower interest expense of $60 million due to the retirement of $1.4 billion in aggregate principal amount of Floating-Rate Notes during 2009, partially offset by interest expense of $108 million on $2.0 billion of debt issued in 2009 and $14 million primarily related to 2008 gains on early debt retirements. Also, in 2009, capitalized interest decreased $54 million due to lower capitalized costs that qualified for interest capitalization.

In December 2008 and January 2009, Anadarko entered into interest-rate swap contracts as a fixed-rate payor to mitigate the cost of potential 2011 and 2012 debt issuances. During periods of declining ten- and thirty-year U.S. Treasury yields, the fair value of this swap portfolio declines, as was the case during the year ended December 31, 2010. Conversely, when ten- and thirty-year U.S. Treasury yields rise, the fair value of this swap portfolio increases, as occurred during the year ended December 31, 2009. In 2009, the Company revised its contract terms which increased the weighted-average interest rate of the Company swap portfolio from approximately 3.25% to approximately 4.80%, resulting in a realized gain of $552 million.

The reimbursement obligation under the MSA was limited to a maximum aggregate reimbursement of $100 million. During 2010, the Company reversed its $95 million liability for this reimbursement obligation to other (income) expense, net as a result of the cancellation of the MSA by Tronox that occurred as part of Tronox bankruptcy proceedings. See Note 14 Commitments and Note 15 Contingencies in the Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements under Item 8, and Legal Proceedings under Item 3 of this Form 10-K for further discussion of events related to Tronox and this obligation. In addition, changes in foreign currency exchange rates lowered other income by $54 million (losses of $2 million in 2010 compared to gains of $52 million in 2009) for the year ended December 31, 2010, primarily attributable to cash held in escrow pending final determination of the Company Brazilian tax liability attributable to its 2008 divestiture of the Peregrino field offshore Brazil. For 2009, the increase in total other income was primarily related to changes in foreign currency exchange rates of $70 million due to cash held in escrow pending final determination of the Company Brazilian tax liability attributable to its 2008 divestiture of the Peregrino field offshore Brazil.

These amounts were partially offset by the following: U.S. income tax impact from losses and restructuring of foreign operations; and the federal manufacturing deduction and other items. The decrease from the 35% statutory rate for the year ended December 31, 2009, is primarily attributable to the following: the accrual of the Algerian exceptional profits tax; foreign tax rate differential and valuation allowance; and U.S. tax on foreign income inclusions and distributions. 61 Table of Contents These amounts were partially offset by the following: benefits associated with changes in uncertain tax positions; state income taxes, including a change in the state income tax rate expected to be in effect at the time the Company deferred state income tax liability is expected to be settled or realized; and U.S. income tax impact from losses and restructuring of foreign operations and other items. The increase from the 35% statutory rate for the year ended December 31, 2008, is primarily attributable to the following: the accrual of the Algerian exceptional profits tax; U.S. tax on foreign income inclusions and distributions; and state income taxes and other items. For additional information on income tax rates, see Note 17 Income Taxes in the Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements under Item 8 of this Form 10-K. Net Income Attributable to Noncontrolling Interests For the years ended December 31, 2010, 2009 and 2008, the Company net income attributable to noncontrolling interests of $60 million, $32 million and $23 million, respectively, primarily related to the public ownership interests in Western Gas Partners, LP (WES), a consolidated subsidiary of the Company. Public ownership of WES was 51.5%, 43.2% and 36.7% at year-end 2010, 2009 and 2008, respectively. See Note 7 Noncontrolling Interests in the Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements under Item 8 of this Form 10-K. OPERATING RESULTS Segment Analysis Adjusted EBITDAX To assess the operating results of Anadarko segments, the chief operating decision maker analyzes income (loss) from continuing operations before income taxes, interest expense, exploration expense, DD&A, impairments, and unrealized (gains) losses on derivative instruments, net, less net income attributable to noncontrolling interests (Adjusted EBITDAX). Anadarko definition of Adjusted EBITDAX, which is not a GAAP measure, excludes interest expense to allow for assessment of segment operating results without regard to Anadarko financing methods or capital structure. The Company definition of Adjusted EBITDAX also excludes exploration expense, as exploration expense is not an indicator of operating efficiency for a given reporting period. However, exploration expense is monitored by management as part of costs incurred in exploration and development activities. Similarly, DD&A and impairments are excluded from Adjusted EBITDAX as a measure of segment operating performance because capital expenditures are evaluated at the time capital costs are incurred. In addition, unrealized (gains) losses on derivative instruments, net are excluded from Adjusted EBITDAX since these unrealized (gains) losses are not considered to be a measure of asset-operating performance. Management believes that the presentation of Adjusted EBITDAX provides information useful in assessing the Company financial condition and results of operations and that Adjusted EBITDAX is a widely accepted financial indicator of a company ability to incur and service debt, fund capital expenditures and make distributions to stockholders. Adjusted EBITDAX, as defined by Anadarko, may not be comparable to similarly titled measures used by other companies. Therefore, Anadarko consolidated Adjusted EBITDAX should be considered in conjunction with net income (loss) attributable to common stockholders and other performance measures prepared in accordance with GAAP, such as operating income or cash flow from operating activities. Adjusted EBITDAX has important limitations as an analytical tool because it excludes certain items that affect net income (loss) attributable to common stockholders and net cash provided by operating activities. Adjusted EBITDAX should not be considered in isolation or as a substitute for an analysis of Anadarko results as reported under GAAP. Below is a reconciliation of consolidated Adjusted EBITDAX to income (loss) from continuing operations before income taxes. 62 Table of Contents Adjusted EBITDAX millions except percentages 2010 Inc/(Dec) vs. 2009 2009 Inc/(Dec) vs. 2008 2008 Income (loss) from continuing operations before income taxes $ 1,641 NM $ (108 ) (102 )% $ 5,368 Exploration expense 974 (12 )% 1,107 (19 ) 1,369 DD&A 3,714 5 3,532 11 3,194 Impairments 216 88 115 (48 ) 223 Interest expense 855 22 702 (4 ) 732 Unrealized (gains) losses on derivative instruments, net* (114 ) (116 ) 717 178 (922 ) Less: Net income attributable to noncontrolling interests 60 88 32 39 23 Consolidated Adjusted EBITDAX $ 7,226 20 $ 6,033 (39 ) $ 9,941 Adjusted EBITDAX by segment Oil and gas exploration and production $ 6,689 22 $ 5,463 (47 ) $ 10,332 Midstream 387 19 324 (24 ) 428 Marketing 7 106 (110 ) NM 34 Other and intersegment eliminations 143 (60 ) 356 142 (853 ) * In the fourth quarter of 2010, the Company revised the definition of Adjusted EBITDAX to exclude the impact of unrealized (gains) losses on derivative instruments, net. All prior periods have been adjusted to reflect this change. Oil and Gas Exploration and Production The increase in Adjusted EBITDAX for the year ended December 31, 2010, was primarily due to the impact of higher commodity prices and higher sales volumes, partially offset by the 2009 reversal of amounts previously accrued in connection with the DWRRA dispute. The decrease in Adjusted EBITDAX for the year ended December 31, 2009, was primarily due to the impact of lower commodity prices, partially offset by higher natural-gas sales volumes primarily in the Rockies and the reversal of amounts previously accrued in connection with the DWRRA dispute. Midstream The increase in Adjusted EBITDAX for the year ended December 31, 2010 resulted primarily from an increase in revenue due to higher prices and NGLs volumes which impacted revenues earned under the Company percent-of-proceeds and keep-whole contracts, partially offset by higher cost of product related to NGLs purchases which increased due to higher NGLs prices, and margins associated with assets divested in 2009. The decrease in Adjusted EBITDAX for the year ended December 31, 2009, resulted primarily from a decrease in revenue due to lower prices for natural gas, NGLs and condensate, which impacted revenues earned under the Company percent-of-proceeds and keep-whole contracts, partially offset by lower cost of product due to lower natural-gas and NGLs prices. Marketing Marketing earnings primarily represent the margin earned on sales of natural gas, oil and NGLs purchased from third parties. The increase in Adjusted EBITDAX for the year ended December 31, 2010, was primarily due to higher margins associated with natural-gas sales from inventory, and lower transportation costs due to lower firm transportation amortization as a result of asset impairments in 2009. The increase in Adjusted EBITDAX for the year ended December 31, 2009, was primarily due to a decrease of approximately 30% in marketed third-party volumes, and lower margins associated with firm transportation contracts due to price differentials between supply and market areas. These amounts were partially offset by higher crude-oil marketing margins, and higher NGLs marketing margins primarily due to inventory write-downs to market value taken in the fourth quarter of 2008. 63 Table of Contents Other and Intersegment Eliminations Other and intersegment eliminations consists primarily of corporate costs, realized gains and losses on derivatives and income from hard minerals investments and royalties. The decrease in Adjusted EBITDAX for the year ended December 31, 2010, was primarily due to realized gains on interest-rate swaps in 2009 partially offset by increased realized gains on commodity derivatives in 2010 and the reversal of the $95 million liability related to the reimbursement obligation that was provided by Kerr-McGee to Tronox pursuant to the terms of the MSA. The increase in Adjusted EBITDAX for the year ended December 31, 2009, was primarily due to realized gains on interest-rate swaps in 2009 and increased realized gains on commodity derivatives in 2009. Proved Reserves Anadarko is focused on growth and profitability, and reserve replacement is a key to growth. Future profitability depends partially upon commodity prices and the cost of finding and developing oil and gas reserves. Reserve growth can be achieved through successful exploration and development drilling, improved recovery or acquisition of producing properties. Additional reserve information is contained in the Supplemental Information on Oil and Gas Exploration and Production Activities (Supplemental Information) under Item 8 of this Form 10-K. MMBOE 2010 2009 2008 Proved Reserves* Beginning of year 2,304 2,277 2,431 Reserve additions and revisions 359 275 188 Sales in place (6 ) (24 ) (137 ) Production (235 ) (224 ) (205 ) End of year 2,422 2,304 2,277 Proved Developed Reserves* Beginning of year 1,624 1,600 1,625 End of year 1,673 1,624 1,600 * As required by the Securities and Exchange Commission, reserves for 2010 and 2009 are computed using the 12-month average beginning-of-month prices, and reserves for 2008 are computed using year-end prices. Reserve Additions and Revisions During 2010, the Company added 359 MMBOE of proved reserves as a result of additions (purchases in place, discoveries and extensions) and revisions. The Company expects the majority of future reserve growth to come from positive revisions associated with infill drilling and extensions of current fields and new discoveries onshore United States and the deep waters of the Gulf of Mexico, as well as through purchases of proved properties in strategic areas and successful exploration in international growth areas. The success of these operations will directly impact reserve additions or revisions in the future. Additions During 2010, Anadarko added 83 MMBOE of proved reserves primarily as a result of successful drilling in the United States. Although shale plays only represent about 2% of the Company total proved reserves, growth in the Company shale plays contributed 45 MMBOE of the total additions. The Company also acquired 1 MMBOE of proved reserves in place related to onshore domestic assets in 2010. During 2009, Anadarko added 70 MMBOE of proved reserves primarily as a result of successful drilling in the United States and international locations. The Company also acquired 32 MMBOE of proved reserves in place related to onshore domestic assets in 2009. During 2008, Anadarko added 96 MMBOE of proved reserves primarily as a result of successful drilling, and development and appraisal wells in the United States. 64 Table of Contents Revisions Total revisions in 2010 were 275 MMBOE or 12% of the beginning-of-year reserve base. The revisions included an increase of 312 MMBOE primarily related to successful infill drilling in large onshore natural-gas plays, such as the Greater Natural Buttes, Wattenberg and Pinedale fields (where the reserve bookings for the infill wells are treated as positive revisions), 77 MMBOE of revisions to prior estimates and 29 MMBOE associated with higher oil and gas prices. These positive revisions were partially offset by the transfer of 143 MMBOE of PUDs to unproved categories as a result of changes to development plans during 2010. Total revisions in 2009 were 173 MMBOE or 8% of the beginning-of-year reserve base. The revisions included an increase of 212 MMBOE primarily related to large onshore natural-gas plays, such as the Greater Natural Buttes and Pinedale fields, as a result of successful infill drilling (where the reserve bookings for the infill wells are treated as positive revisions). The revisions also include a decrease of 39 MMBOE caused by lower natural-gas prices. Total revisions in 2008 were 92 MMBOE or 4% of the beginning-of-year reserve base. The revisions included an increase of 194 MMBOE primarily related to Greater Natural Buttes, Wattenberg and Pinedale fields, as a result of successful infill drilling, and positive revisions to the Peregrino heavy-oil field, offshore Brazil, which was sold in 2008, partially offset by a decrease of 102 MMBOE related to price impacts for oil and NGLs. Sales in Place During 2010, the Company sold properties located in the United States and Egypt representing 5 MMBOE of proved developed reserves and 1 MMBOE of proved undeveloped reserves. In 2009, the Company sold properties located onshore United States representing 24 MMBOE of proved reserves. These properties were primarily in the Rockies and represented 14 MMBOE of developed properties and 10 MMBOE of undeveloped properties. In 2008, the Company sold properties located onshore United States and Brazil. The properties located in the United States represented 46 MMBOE of proved reserves with 31 MMBOE developed and 15 MMBOE undeveloped. The properties located in Brazil represented 91 MMBOE of proved undeveloped reserves. Discounted Future Net Cash Flows At December 31, 2010, the discounted (at 10%) estimated future net cash flows from Anadarko proved reserves was $21.5 billion (stated in accordance with the regulations of the Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC) and the Financial Accounting Standards Board (FASB)). These discounted future net cash flows were calculated based on the 12-month average beginning-of-month prices for the year, held flat for the life of the reserves, adjusted for any contractual provisions. For reporting periods prior to December 31, 2009, year-end prices were used for calculating discounted future net cash flows. The increase of $7.9 billion or 58% in 2010 compared to 2009 is primarily due to changes in prices and costs as well as revisions of previous quantity estimates. See Supplemental Information under Item 8 of this Form 10-K. The present value of future net cash flows does not purport to be an estimate of the fair value of Anadarko proved reserves. A fair-value estimate would also take into account, among other things, anticipated changes in future prices and costs, the expected recovery of reserves in excess of proved reserves and a discount factor more representative of the time value of money and the risks inherent in producing oil and gas. LIQUIDITY AND CAPITAL RESOURCES Overview Anadarko generates its capital needed over the long term to fund capital expenditures, debt-service obligations, and dividend payments primarily from cash flows from operating activities, and enters into debt and equity transactions to maintain the desired capital structure and finance acquisition opportunities. Liquidity may also be enhanced through asset divestitures and joint ventures that reduce future capital expenditures. Consistent with this approach, during 2010, cash flows from operating activities were the primary source for funding capital investment, while proceeds from issuing debt were used to refinance existing debt obligations. The Company continuously monitors its liquidity needs, coordinates its capital expenditure program with its expected cash flows and projected debt-repayment schedule, and evaluates available funding alternatives in light of both current and expected future conditions. During 2010, the Company further enhanced its liquidity in response to the potential exposure to future obligations related to the Deepwater Horizon events by refinancing $3.0 billion of its 2011 and 2012 scheduled maturities with longer-term debt and replacing its $1.3 billion revolving credit facility scheduled to mature in 2013 with the $5.0 billion Facility maturing in 2015, thereby significantly increasing the Company capacity for immediate access to capital. Entering into the $5.0 billion Facility, coupled with certain modifications to contracts governing the Company commodity derivative arrangements, also reduced the Company potential obligation to provide cash collateral, as discussed under Effects of Credit Rating Downgrade below. 65 Table of Contents At December 31, 2010, Anadarko 2011 and 2012 scheduled debt maturities were $289 million and $223 million, respectively, for a total of $512 million (including repayments of WES senior unsecured revolving credit facility (RCF) and the Company capital lease obligations), or $1.2 billion including the accreted value of Zero-Coupon Senior Notes (Zero Coupons) that could be put to the Company in 2012, as discussed below. The Company has a variety of funding sources available, including cash on hand of $3.7 billion at December 31, 2010, an asset portfolio that provides ongoing cash-flow-generating capacity and opportunities for liquidity enhancement through divestitures and joint-venture arrangements. In addition, the Company $5.0 billion Facility remains undrawn at December 31, 2010, providing available capacity of $4.6 billion ($5.0 billion undrawn capacity less $377 million of outstanding letters of credit supported by the $5.0 billion Facility). Management believes that the Company liquidity position, asset portfolio, and continued strong operating and financial performance provide the necessary financial flexibility to fund current operations and, based on information currently available, any potential future obligations related to the Deepwater Horizon events. However, Anadarko is currently unable to predict the ultimate impact of the Deepwater Horizon events on the Company liquidity and financial condition. See Note 2 Deepwater Horizon Events in the Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements under Item 8 of this Form 10-K. Revolving Credit Facility Borrowings under the $5.0 billion Facility will bear interest, at the Company election, at (i) the London Interbank Offered Rate (LIBOR) plus a margin ranging from 2.75% to 3.75%, based on the Company credit rating, or (ii) the greatest of (a) the JPMorgan Chase Bank prime rate, (b) the federal funds rate plus 0.50%, or (c) one-month LIBOR plus 1%, plus in each case, an applicable margin. Obligations incurred under the $5.0 billion Facility, as well as obligations Anadarko may have to certain lenders or their affiliates pursuant to certain derivative instruments as discussed in Note 9 Derivative Instruments in the Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements under Item 8 of this Form 10-K, are guaranteed by certain of the Company wholly owned domestic subsidiaries, and are secured by a perfected first-priority security interest in certain exploration and production assets located in the United States and 65% of the capital stock of certain wholly owned foreign subsidiaries. The Company incurred upfront underwriting, structuring, arrangement and other costs in connection with the $5.0 billion Facility. These costs were capitalized and will be amortized over the five-year credit commitment term. The cost of capital to the Company under the terms of the $5.0 billion Facility is greater than the cost of capital to the Company under the $1.3 billion revolving credit agreement previously in effect due to the increased size and term of the $5.0 billion Facility and then-current market conditions. For example, outstanding borrowings under the $5.0 billion Facility at December 31, 2010, would bear a LIBOR-based interest-rate margin of 2.75% as compared to a margin of 0.55% provided for under the $1.3 billion credit agreement previously in effect. Costs ultimately incurred under the $5.0 billion Facility will vary with the level of facility utilization, the ultimate borrowing terms and Anadarko corporate credit rating. Financial Covenants The $5.0 billion Facility contains various customary covenants with which Anadarko must comply, including, but not limited to, limitations on incurrence of indebtedness, liens on assets, and asset sales. Anadarko is also required to maintain, at the end of each quarter, (i) a Consolidated Leverage Ratio of no more than 4.5 to 1.0 (relative to Consolidated EBITDAX for the most recent period of four calendar quarters), (ii) a ratio of Current Assets to Current Liabilities of no less than 1.0 to 1.0, and (iii) a Collateral Coverage Ratio of no less than 1.75 to 1.0, in each case, as defined in the $5.0 billion Facility. The Collateral Coverage Ratio is the ratio of an annually redetermined value of pledged assets to outstanding loans under the $5.0 billion Facility. Additionally, to borrow from the $5.0 billion Facility, the Collateral Coverage Ratio must be no less than 1.75 to 1.0 after giving pro forma effect to the requested borrowing. The Company was in compliance with all applicable covenants at December 31, 2010, and there were no restrictions on its ability to utilize the available capacity of the $5.0 billion Facility. At December 31, 2010, the covenants contained in certain of the Company credit agreements provided for a maximum debt-to-capitalization ratio of 67%. The covenants do not specifically restrict the payment of dividends; however, the impact of dividends paid on the Company debt-to-capitalization ratio must be considered in order to ensure covenant compliance. At December 31, 2010, Anadarko was in compliance with all financial covenants. Zero-Coupon Notes In a 2006 private offering, Anadarko received $500 million of loan proceeds upon issuing the Zero Coupons maturing October 2036. The Zero Coupons have an aggregate principal amount due at maturity of $2.4 billion, reflecting a yield to maturity of 5.24%. The holder has the right to cause the Company to repay up to 100% of the then-accreted value of the Zero Coupons in October of each year starting in 2012. The accreted value of the Zero Coupons is $607 million at December 31, 2010 and will be $682 million at the next possible put date in October 2012. 66 Table of Contents The Company considers its cash-flow-generating capacity and access to additional liquidity sufficient to continue to satisfy the Company debt-service and other obligations, including the potential early repayment of the Zero Coupons if the put option is exercised by the holder. Effects of Credit Rating Downgrade As a consequence of uncertainties regarding the possible range of Anadarko potential obligations related to the Deepwater Horizon events, in June 2010, Moody lowered the Company senior unsecured credit rating from Baa3 to Ba1 and placed the Company long-term ratings under review for further possible downgrade (the credit rating downgrade), while S&P and Fitch each affirmed their BBB- rating with a negative outlook. In September 2010, Moody announced that it concluded its review and confirmed Anadarko Ba1 credit rating and changed the rating outlook to stable. As a result of the credit rating downgrade in June 2010, the Company credit thresholds with its derivative counterparties were reduced and in many cases eliminated, which would ordinarily increase the possibility that counterparties could require additional collateral when the Company net derivative trading position is a liability. However, because certain of the Company derivative counterparties are also lenders under the $5.0 billion Facility, and as such, receive security interests in specified assets of the Company, derivative-related agreements with most of these counterparties have been amended such that those counterparties require no additional collateral beyond that provided under the $5.0 billion Facility. As a result, at December 31, 2010, the Company had only $15 million of cash collateral provided as security for its derivative-contract-related obligations (compared to $105 million at December 31, 2009), and expects such future cash requirements to be relatively insignificant. The credit rating downgrade also increases the likelihood of Anadarko being required to post collateral as financial assurance of its performance under other contractual arrangements, such as pipeline transportation contracts, oil and gas sales contracts and work commitments. At December 31, 2010, $461 million of letters of credit ($377 million of which were supported by the $5.0 billion Facility) were provided as assurance of the Company performance under various contractual arrangements and commitments, compared to $339 million at December 31, 2009. WES Funding Sources Anadarko consolidated subsidiary, WES, primarily uses cash to fund its ongoing operations, make acquisitions and other capital investments, service its debt, and make distributions to equity holders. WES relies primarily on cash generated from its operating activities for funding, as well as debt or equity issuances, supplemented as needed with borrowings under its revolving credit facility. WES has committed borrowing capacity of $450 million under its RCF that extends through October 2012. The RCF is not guaranteed by Anadarko or any of its wholly owned subsidiaries. Outstanding borrowings under the RCF, which bear interest at LIBOR plus an applicable margin ranging from 2.375% to 3.250% (for a rate of 3.26% at December 31, 2010), were $49 million at December 31, 2010, with $401 million remaining borrowing capacity. The credit rating downgrade of Anadarko did not affect the availability of credit or the cost of borrowing under the WES RCF. Insurance Coverage and Other Indemnities Anadarko maintains property and casualty insurance that includes coverage for physical damage to the Company properties, blowout/control of well, restoration and redrill, sudden and accidental pollution, third-party liability, workers compensation and employers liability, and other risks. The below-stated insurance limits for blowout/control of well and for third-party liabilities are reduced proportionally to Anadarko participating interest in a venture. Some of the below-stated limits are aggregate amounts, but most policies allow for reinstatement. Anadarko insurance coverage includes deductibles which must be met prior to recovery. Additionally, the Company insurance is subject to exclusions and limitations and there is no assurance that such coverage will adequately protect the Company against liability from all potential consequences and damages. Anadarko property and casualty insurance policies renew in June of each year, with the next renewals scheduled for June 2011. In light of the Deepwater Horizon events, the Company may not be able to secure similar coverage for the same costs, if at all. Future insurance coverage for the oil and gas industry could increase in cost and may include higher deductibles or retentions. In addition, some forms of insurance may become unavailable in the future or unavailable on terms that the Company considers economically acceptable. Refer to Note 2 Deepwater Horizon Events Insurance Recoveries in the Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements under Item 8 of this Form 10-K for discussion of the Company insurance coverage applicable to the Deepwater Horizon events. 67 Table of Contents The Company current insurance coverage, which was obtained subsequent to the Deepwater Horizon events, includes physical damage to Anadarko properties on a replacement cost basis; $500 million in limit for loss of production income for the Independence Hub facility; $500 million for an offshore blowout/control of a well, restoration and redrill, and pollution from an offshore blowout ($75 million for onshore); $275 million aircraft liability; and $675 million in limit for third-party liabilities. The Company total limit is approximately $1.2 billion (which is reduced proportionally to the Company participating interest in a venture) for the negative environmental impacts of an offshore blowout. If caused by a named windstorm, there is currently no coverage for physical damage to the Company properties, loss of production income for the Independence Hub facility, blowout/control of a well, or restoration and redrill. The Company service agreements, including drilling contracts, generally indemnify Anadarko for injuries and death to employees of the service provider and subcontractors hired by the service provider as well as for property damage suffered by the service provider and its contractors. Also, these service agreements generally indemnify Anadarko for pollution originating from the equipment of any contractors or subcontractors hired by the service provider. Following is a discussion of significant sources and uses of cash flows for the three-year period ended December 31, 2010. Forward-looking information related to the Company liquidity and capital resources is discussed in Outlook that follows. Sources of Cash Operating Activities Anadarko cash flow from operating activities in 2010 was $5.2 billion compared to $3.9 billion in 2009 and $6.4 billion in 2008. The increase in cash flow from continuing operations for the year ended December 31, 2010, was primarily attributable to higher commodity prices, higher sales volumes and the impact of changes in working capital items. The decrease in cash flow from continuing operations for the year ended December 31, 2009, was primarily attributable to lower commodity prices, partially offset by higher sales volumes and realized gains on interest-rate derivatives that resulted from the Company election to revise the contractual terms of its interest-rate swap portfolio which resulted in the realization of $552 million in cash. Fluctuations in commodity prices are one of the primary sources of variability in the Company cash flows from operating activities, which Anadarko manages by entering into commodity derivative instruments. Sales-volume changes also impact cash flow, but have not been as volatile as commodity prices. Anadarko long-term cash flows from operating activities is dependent on commodity prices, sales volumes, the amount of costs and expenses required for continued operations and debt service, as well as any potential obligation to fund Deepwater Horizon event-related liabilities. Refer to Note 2 Deepwater Horizon Events in the Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements under Item 8 of this Form 10-K for discussion and analysis of these events. Investing Activities During 2010, 2009 and 2008, Anadarko received proceeds of $70 million, $176 million and $2.5 billion before income taxes, respectively, related to several property divestiture transactions. Proceeds received in 2008 relate to the divestiture and portfolio rationalization activity initiated following Anadarko corporate acquisitions completed in August 2006. In connection with the retirement of the Midstream Subsidiary Note and the associated liquidation of Trinity Associates LLC (Trinity) in 2010, Anadarko received $100 million in cash representing the return of the Company original investment in Trinity. Financing Activities During 2010, the Company received net proceeds of $2.7 billion related to the issuance of $2.8 billion in aggregate principal amount of senior notes and used the net proceeds, combined with cash on hand, to redeem $3.0 billion aggregate principal amount of 2011 and 2012 debt maturities. See Uses of Cash for further information about debt repayments. As discussed in Revolving Credit Facility above, Anadarko entered into the $5.0 billion Facility in 2010. In connection with the $5.0 billion Facility, the Company incurred upfront underwriting, structuring, arrangement and other costs totaling $172 million. No borrowings were made under the $5.0 billion Facility upon closing and through the date of filing this Form 10-K. 68 Table of Contents During 2010, Anadarko consolidated subsidiary, WES, borrowed a total of $670 million under a three-year senior unsecured term loan (the Term Loan) and RCF primarily to fund the acquisition of certain midstream assets from Anadarko. During 2010, WES issued approximately 13 million common units in two public offerings, realizing net proceeds of $338 million, which were used to repay a portion of outstanding RCF borrowings. During 2009, Anadarko raised $2.0 billion in connection with the public offering of senior notes and an additional $1.3 billion in connection with the public offering of 30 million shares of common stock. Proceeds from the offerings were used to fund the retirement of outstanding Floating Rate Notes and for general corporate purposes. During 2008, $321 million was raised in connection with the initial public offering of 20.8 million common units of its consolidated affiliate, WES. See Note 7 Noncontrolling Interest in the Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements under Item 8 of this Form 10-K. Proceeds from the offering were used to reduce debt. Uses of Cash In addition to ongoing funding of operating costs and expenses, including interest cost and taxes, Anadarko invests significant capital to acquire, explore and develop oil and natural-gas resources and midstream infrastructure, and makes debt repayments. Capital Expenditures The following table presents the Company capital expenditures by category. millions 2010 2009 2008 Property Acquisitions Exploration $ 519 $ 279 $ 405 Development 22 266 26 Exploration 1,278 1,229 1,031 Development 3,267 2,886 3,530 Total oil and gas costs incurred* 5,086 4,660 4,992 Less: Corporate acquisitions and non-cash property exchanges (37 ) (284 ) (106 ) Less: Asset retirement costs (86 ) (63 ) (263 ) Less: Geological and geophysical, exploration overhead, delay rentals expenses and other expenses (291 ) (312 ) (344 ) Less: Amortization of acquired drilling rig contract intangibles (5 ) Total oil and gas capital expenditures 4,672 4,001 4,274 Gathering, processing and marketing and other 497 557 607 Total capital expenditures* $ 5,169 $ 4,558 $ 4,881 * Oil and gas costs incurred represent costs related to finding and developing oil and gas reserves. Capital expenditures represent additions to property and equipment excluding corporate acquisitions, property exchanges and asset retirement costs. Capital expenditures and costs incurred are presented on an accrual basis. Additions to properties and equipment on the Consolidated Statements of Cash Flows include certain adjustments that give effect to the timing of actual cash payments in order to provide a cash-basis presentation. Anadarko capital spending increased 13% for the year ended December 31, 2010, primarily due to an increase in exploration lease acquisitions onshore and offshore United States, higher development drilling onshore and increased expenditures related to construction in Algeria. During 2010, the Company reallocated 7% of its total 2010 budgeted capital expenditures from the Gulf of Mexico and redirected onshore United States capital expenditures to focus on liquids-rich areas onshore United States. The Company spent approximately $200 million less than the original budgeted capital expenditures. During the first quarter of 2010, the Company entered into a joint-venture agreement that requires a third-party joint-venture partner to fund up to $1.5 billion of Anadarko share of future acquisition, drilling, completion, equipment and other capital expenditures to earn a 32.5% interest in Anadarko Marcellus shale assets, primarily located in north-central Pennsylvania. At December 31, 2010, $394 million of the total $1.5 billion obligation had been funded. 69 Table of Contents Anadarko capital expenditures decreased 7% for the year ended December 31, 2009 primarily due to declines in development drilling expenditures onshore United States and expenditures on gathering and processing facilities. These declines were partially offset by an increase in development drilling expenditures in Ghana, exploration drilling expenditures onshore United States, property acquisition costs and capital expenditures related to the Company acquisition of office buildings in The Woodlands, Texas. Property acquisitions in 2009 primarily related to exploratory non-producing leases onshore United States and proved property acquisitions related to property exchanges in the Rockies. Property acquisitions in 2008 primarily related to exploratory non-producing leases. See Outlook below for information regarding sources of cash used to fund capital expenditures for 2011. Debt Retirements and Repayments In 2010, the Company used $1.6 billion to repay the Midstream Subsidiary Note and $1.5 billion, including $86 million for early-tender premiums, to redeem senior notes scheduled to mature in 2011 and 2012. The repayments were funded with proceeds from new borrowings, as well as cash on hand. Also in 2010, WES repaid $371 million outstanding under its RCF primarily from proceeds related to its public offerings discussed in Sources of Cash . In 2009, using a portion of proceeds from new debt issuances, the Company repaid an aggregate principal amount of $1.6 billion of debt that was outstanding at December 31, 2008, including $1.4 billion in aggregate principal amount of Floating-Rate Notes due in 2009. In 2008, Anadarko repaid an aggregate principal amount of $2.4 billion of outstanding debt including the remaining balance of the variable-rate 354-day facility originally used to fund corporate acquisitions, and $580 million in aggregate principal amount of Floating-Rate Notes due September 2009. The debt repayments were funded primarily by operating cash flow and proceeds from asset divestitures. For additional information on the Company debt instruments, such as transactions during the period, years of maturity and interest rates, see Note 9 Derivative Instruments and Note 11 Debt and Interest Expense in the Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements under Item 8 of this Form 10-K. Common Stock Repurchase Program In August 2008, the Company initiated a $5 billion share-repurchase program under which shares may be repurchased either in the open market or through privately negotiated transactions. The program is authorized to extend through August 2011. The program does not obligate Anadarko to acquire any specific number of shares and may be discontinued at any time. During 2008, Anadarko purchased 10 million shares of common stock for $600 million under the program through purchases in the open market and under share-repurchase agreements. No shares were repurchased under the program in 2009 or 2010. Common Stock Dividends and Distributions to Noncontrolling WES Interest Owners In 2010, 2009 and 2008, Anadarko paid $180 million, $176 million and $170 million, respectively, in dividends to its common stockholders (nine cents per share per quarter). Anadarko has paid a dividend to its common stockholders quarterly since becoming an independent public company in 1986. The amount of future dividends for Anadarko common stock will depend on earnings, financial conditions, capital requirements, the effect a dividend payment would have on the Company compliance with relevant financial covenants contained in its debt agreements and other factors, and will be determined by the Board of Directors on a quarterly basis. Anadarko consolidated subsidiary, WES, distributed to its unitholders other than Anadarko an aggregate of $42 million, $26 million and $10 million during 2010, 2009 and 2008, respectively. WES has made quarterly distributions to its unitholders since its initial public offering in the second quarter of 2008 and has increased its distribution from $0.33 per common unit for the fourth quarter of 2009 to $0.38 per common unit for the fourth quarter of 2010. 70 Table of Contents Outlook The Company remains committed to the execution of its worldwide exploration, appraisal and development programs. The Company plans to allocate approximately 60% of its 2011 capital spending to development activities, 25% to exploration activities and 15% to gas-gathering and processing activities and other business activities. The Company expects its 2011 capital spending by area to be approximately 50% for the United States onshore region and Alaska, 10% for the Gulf of Mexico, 25% for International and 15% for Midstream and other. Anadarko believes that its expected level of operating cash flows and cash on hand at December 31, 2010, will be sufficient to fund the Company projected operational and capital programs for 2011, while continuing to meet its other obligations. However, if capital expenditures exceed operating cash flows and cash on hand, additional funding would likely be supplemented as needed through short-term borrowings under the $5.0 billion Facility, which remains undrawn at December 31, 2010 and provides available capacity of $4.6 billion ($5.0 billion undrawn capacity less $377 million of outstanding letters of credit supported by the $5.0 billion Facility), as well as asset divestitures and joint-venture arrangements. The Company continuously monitors its liquidity needs, coordinates its capital expenditure program with its expected cash flows and projected debt-repayment schedule, and evaluates available funding alternatives in light of both current and expected future conditions. In order to increase the predictability of 2011 cash flows, Anadarko has entered into strategic derivative positions, which, at December 31, 2010, cover approximately 25% and 57% of its anticipated natural-gas sales volumes and oil and condensate sales volumes, respectively, for 2011. In addition, the Company has commodity derivative positions in place for 2012. See Note 9 Derivative Instruments in the Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements under Item 8 of this Form 10-K. The Company primary emphasis is on managing near-term growth opportunities with a commitment to worldwide exploration and the continued development of large oil projects in Algeria, offshore Ghana and in the deepwater Gulf of Mexico. In response to the Deepwater Horizon events, the federal government may issue further safety and environmental laws or regulations regarding operations in the Gulf of Mexico, in addition to the regulations promulgated by the BOEMRE during 2010, which are described in greater detail in the Risk Factors under Item 1A of this Form 10-K. These additional laws and regulations, delays in the processing and approval of drilling permits and exploration and oil spill-response plans as well as possible additional actions could affect the timing of new drilling and ongoing development efforts, result in increased costs, and limit activities in certain areas of the Gulf of Mexico. Off-Balance Sheet Arrangements Anadarko may enter into off-balance sheet arrangements and transactions that can give rise to material off-balance sheet obligations. At December 31, 2010, the Company material off-balance sheet arrangements and transactions include operating lease arrangements and undrawn letters of credit. There are no other transactions, arrangements or other relationships with unconsolidated entities or other persons that are reasonably likely to materially affect Anadarko liquidity or availability of or requirements for capital resources. See Obligations and Commitments for more information regarding off-balance sheet arrangements. 71 Table of Contents Obligations and Commitments The following is a summary of the Company obligations at December 31, 2010. Obligations by Period millions 1 Year 2-3 Years 4-5 Years More than 5 Years Total Total debt Principal current borrowings $ 285 $ $ $ $ 285 Principal long-term borrowings (1) 469 775 13,007 14,251 Principal capital lease obligations (2) 4 9 12 201 226 Investee entities debt (3) 2,853 2,853 Interest on borrowings 845 1,634 1,519 8,697 12,695 Interest on capital lease obligations (2) 33 66 63 260 422 Investee entities interest (3) 44 153 266 4,321 4,784 Operating leases Drilling rig commitments 574 795 1,369 Production platforms 61 90 107 204 462 Other 92 120 58 34 304 Asset retirement obligations 42 470 118 941 1,571 Midstream and marketing activities 282 540 403 666 1,891 Oil and gas activities 880 726 81 394 2,081 Derivative liabilities (4) 42 56 165 263 Uncertain tax positions, interest and penalties (5) 24 34 58 Environmental liabilities 19 22 12 43 96 Total (6) $ 3,227 $ 5,184 $ 3,414 $ 31,786 $ 43,611 (1) This table presents the fully accreted principal amount of the Zero Coupons of $2.4 billion as coming due after 2015. While the Zero Coupons do not mature until 2036, the holder has the right to put the Zero Coupons to the Company each October beginning in 2012 at their then-accreted value. The Company could be required to repurchase 100% of the Zero Coupons at $682 million in October 2012. (2) See Note 11 Debt and Interest Expense in the Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements under Item 8 of this Form 10-K for capital lease obligations. (3) Anadarko has legal right of setoff and intends to net-settle its obligations under each of the notes payable to the investees with the distributable value of its interest in the corresponding investee. Accordingly, the investments and the obligations are presented net on the Consolidated Balance Sheets and included in other long-term liabilities other for all periods presented. These notes payable provide for a variable rate of interest, reset quarterly. Therefore, future interest payments presented in the table above are estimated using the forward LIBOR rate curve. Further, the above table does not reflect the preferred return that Anadarko receives on its investment in these entities, which is also LIBOR-based, with a lower margin than the margin on the associated notes payable. See Note 8 Investments in the Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements under Item 8 of this Form 10-K. (4) Represents Anadarko gross derivative liability after taking into account the impacts of netting margin and collateral balances deposited with counterparties. See Note 9 Derivative Instruments in the Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements under Item 8 of this Form 10-K. (5) See Note 17 Income Taxes in the Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements under Item 8 of this Form 10-K. (6) This table does not include the Company pension or postretirement benefit obligations. See Note 20 Pension Plans, Other Postretirement Benefits and Defined-Contribution Plans in the Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements under Item 8 of this Form 10-K. 72 Table of Contents Operating Leases Operating lease obligations include several deepwater drilling rig commitments totaling $1.4 billion. Anadarko continues to manage its access to rigs in order to execute its worldwide deepwater drilling strategy over the next several years. Lease payments associated with successful exploratory wells and development wells, net of amounts billed to partners, are capitalized as a component of oil and gas properties. See Note 15 Contingencies Deepwater Drilling Moratorium and Other Related Matters in the Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements under Item 8 of this Form 10-K for additional information on drilling rigs. The Company has $766 million in commitments under noncancelable operating lease agreements for production platforms and equipment, buildings, facilities, compressors and aircraft. For additional information, see Note 14 Commitments in the Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements under Item 8 of this Form 10-K. Asset Retirement Obligations Anadarko is obligated to fund the costs of disposing of long-lived assets upon their abandonment. The majority of Anadarko asset retirement obligations (AROs) relate to the plugging of wells and the related abandonment of oil and gas properties. The Company AROs are recorded at estimated fair value, measured by reference to the expected future cash outflows required to satisfy the retirement obligation discounted at the Company credit-adjusted risk-free interest rate. Revisions to estimated AROs can result from changes in retirement cost estimates, revisions to estimated inflation rates and changes in the estimated timing of abandonment. Midstream and Marketing Activities Anadarko has entered into various transportation, storage and purchase agreements in order to access markets and provide flexibility for the sale of its natural gas and crude oil in certain areas. Oil and Gas Activities Anadarko has various long-term contractual commitments pertaining to exploration, development and production activities that extend beyond 2010. The Company has work-related commitments for, among other things, drilling wells, obtaining and processing seismic and fulfilling rig commitments. The preceding table includes long-term drilling and work-related commitments of $2,081 million, comprised of $1,433 million related to the United States and $648 million related to international locations. Environmental Liabilities Anadarko is subject to various environmental-remediation and reclamation obligations arising from federal, state and local laws and regulations. At December 31, 2010, the Company balance sheet included a $96 million liability for remediation and reclamation obligations, most of which relate to companies acquired by Anadarko. The Company continually monitors the liability recorded and the remediation and reclamation process, and believes the amount recorded is appropriate. For additional information on environmental issues, see Risk Factors under Item 1A of this Form 10-K. For additional information on contracts, obligations and arrangements the Company enters into from time to time, see Note 9 Derivative Instruments, Note 11 Debt and Interest Expense, Note 14 Commitments, and Note 15 Contingencies in the Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements under Item 8 of this Form 10-K. Discontinued Operations In November 2006, Anadarko sold its wholly owned subsidiary, Anadarko Canada Corporation. The results of Anadarko Canadian operations have been classified as discontinued operations in the Consolidated Statements of Income and Consolidated Statements of Cash Flows for 2008 and primarily relate to adjustments to an indemnity obligation provided by the Company to the purchaser, as well as expenses associated with finalizing exit activities. See Note 15 Contingencies in the Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements under Item 8 of this Form 10-K. 73 Table of Contents CRITICAL ACCOUNTING ESTIMATES In preparing financial statements in accordance with GAAP, management makes informed judgments and estimates that affect the reported amounts of assets and liabilities as of the date of the financial statements and the reported amounts of revenues and expenses during the periods reported. Management reviews its estimates and related assumptions regularly, including those related to the value of properties and equipment, proved reserves, goodwill, intangible assets, asset retirement obligations, litigation reserves, environmental liabilities, pension assets and liabilities and costs, income taxes and fair values. Changes in facts and circumstances or additional information may result in revised estimates and actual results may differ from these estimates. Management considers the following to be its most critical accounting estimates that involve judgment and discusses the selection and development of these estimates with the Company Audit Committee. Oil and Gas Activities Anadarko applies the successful efforts method of accounting to account for its oil and gas activities. Under this method, acquisition costs and the costs associated with drilling exploratory wells are capitalized pending the determination of proved oil and gas reserves. Geological and geophysical costs and other costs of carrying properties such as delay rentals are expensed as incurred. Acquisition Costs Acquisition costs of unproved properties are assessed for impairment during the holding period and transferred to proved oil and gas properties to the extent the costs are associated with successful exploration activities. Significant undeveloped leases are assessed individually for impairment, based on the Company current exploration plans, and a valuation allowance is provided if impairment is indicated. For unproved oil and gas properties with individually insignificant lease acquisition costs, costs are amortized on a group basis (thereby establishing a valuation allowance) over the average lease term at rates that provide for full amortization of unsuccessful leases upon lease expiration or abandonment. Costs of expired or abandoned leases are charged against the valuation allowance, while costs of productive leases are transferred to proved oil and gas properties. Costs of maintaining and retaining unproved properties, as well as amortization of individually insignificant leases and impairment of unsuccessful leases, are included in exploration expense. Significant undeveloped leasehold costs are assessed for impairment at a lease level or resource play (for example, the Greater Natural Buttes area in the Rockies), while leasehold acquisition costs associated with prospective areas that have had limited or no previous exploratory drilling are generally assessed for impairment by major prospect area. A majority of the Company unproved property costs are associated with properties acquired in the Kerr-McGee and Western acquisitions in 2006 and to which proved developed producing reserves are also attributed. Generally, economic recovery of unproved reserves in such areas is not yet supported by actual production or conclusive formation tests, but may be confirmed by the Company continuing exploration and development programs. Another portion of the Company unproved property costs are associated with the Land Grant acreage, where the Company owns mineral interests in perpetuity and plans to continue to explore and evaluate the acreage. A change in the Company expected future plans for exploration and development could cause an impairment of the Company unproved property. Exploratory Costs Under the successful efforts method of accounting, exploratory costs associated with a well discovering hydrocarbons are initially capitalized, or suspended, pending determination of whether proved reserves can be attributed to the area as a result of drilling. At the end of each quarter, management reviews the status of all suspended exploratory drilling costs in light of ongoing exploration activities, which includes, for example, analyzing whether the Company is making sufficient progress in its ongoing exploration and appraisal efforts or, in the case of discoveries requiring government sanctioning, analyzing whether development negotiations are underway or proceeding as planned. If management determines that future appraisal drilling or development activities are unlikely to occur, associated suspended exploratory drilling costs are expensed in that period. Therefore, at any point in time, the Company may have capitalized costs on its Consolidated Balance Sheets associated with exploratory wells that may be charged to exploration expense in a future period. 74 Table of Contents Proved Reserves In December 2009, Anadarko adopted revised oil and gas reserve estimation and disclosure requirements that conform the definition of proved reserves to the SEC Modernization of Oil and Gas Reporting rules, which were issued by the SEC at the end of 2008. These rules require that the average, first-day-of-the-month price during the 12-month period preceding the end of the year, rather than the year-end price, be used when estimating reserve quantities and permit the use of reliable technologies to determine proved reserves, if those technologies have been demonstrated to result in reliable conclusions about reserve volumes. Prior-year data are presented in accordance with FASB oil and gas disclosure requirements effective during those periods; however, historical information has been reclassified to conform to the significant geographic areas required to be disclosed under the revised rules. Anadarko estimates its proved oil and gas reserves as defined by the SEC and the FASB. This definition includes crude oil, natural gas and NGLs that geological and engineering data demonstrate with reasonable certainty to be economically producible in future periods from known reservoirs under existing economic conditions, operating methods, government regulations, etc., i.e., at prices as described above and costs as of the date the estimates are made. Prices include consideration of price changes provided only by contractual arrangements, and do not include adjustments based upon expected future conditions. The Company estimates of proved reserves are made using available geological and reservoir data, as well as production performance data. These estimates are reviewed annually by internal reservoir engineers and revised, either upward or downward, as warranted by additional data. Revisions are necessary due to changes in, among other things, reservoir performance, prices, economic conditions and governmental restrictions, as well as changes in the expected recovery associated with infill drilling. Decreases in prices, for example, may cause a reduction in some proved reserves due to reaching economic limits earlier. A material adverse change in the estimated volumes of proved reserves could have a negative impact on DD&A and could result in the recognition of an impairment. Environmental Obligations and Other Contingencies Management makes judgments and estimates in accordance with applicable accounting rules when it establishes reserves for environmental remediation, litigation and other contingent matters. Provisions for such matters are charged to expense when it is probable that a liability has been incurred and reasonable estimates of the liability can be made. Estimates of environmental liabilities are based on a variety of matters, including, but not limited to, the stage of investigation, the stage of the remedial design, evaluation of existing remediation technologies, and presently enacted laws and regulations. In future periods, a number of factors could significantly change the Company estimate of environmental-remediation costs, such as changes in laws and regulations, changes in the interpretation or administration of laws and regulations, revisions to the remedial design, unanticipated construction problems, identification of additional areas or volumes of contaminated soil and groundwater, and changes in costs of labor, equipment and technology. Consequently, it is not possible for management to reliably estimate the amount and timing of all future expenditures related to environmental or other contingent matters and actual costs may vary significantly from the Company estimates. The Company in-house legal counsel and environmental personnel regularly assess these contingent liabilities and, in certain circumstances, third-party legal counsel or consultants are utilized. 75 Table of Contents Fair Value The Company estimates fair value for derivatives, long-lived assets for impairment testing, reporting units for goodwill impairment testing, assets and liabilities exchanged in non-monetary transactions, guarantees, pension plan assets, initial measurements of AROs, assets and liabilities acquired in a business combination and financial instruments that require fair-value disclosure, including cash and cash equivalents, accounts receivable, accounts payable and debt. When the Company is required to measure fair value and there is not a market-observable price for the asset or liability or a market-observable price for a similar asset or liability, the Company generally utilizes an income valuation approach. This approach is based upon management best assumptions regarding expectations of projected cash flows, and discounts the expected cash flows using a commensurate risk-adjusted discount rate. Such evaluations involve significant judgment and the results are based on expected future events or conditions, such as sales prices, estimates of future oil and gas production or throughput, development and operating costs and the timing thereof, economic and regulatory climates and other factors. The Company estimates of future net cash flows are inherently imprecise because they reflect management expectation of future conditions that are often outside of management control. However, assumptions used reflect a market participant view of long-term prices, costs and other factors, and are consistent with assumptions used in the Company business plans and investment decisions. Goodwill At December 31, 2010, the Company had $5.3 billion of goodwill recorded related to past business combinations. The Company tests goodwill for impairment annually at October 1, or more often as facts and circumstances warrant. The first step in assessing whether an impairment of goodwill is necessary is to compare the fair value of the reporting unit to which goodwill has been assigned to the carrying amount of the associated net assets and goodwill. A reporting unit is an operating segment or a component that is one level below an operating segment. Anadarko has allocated goodwill to three reporting units: oil and gas exploration and production, gathering and processing, and transportation. At December 31, 2010, these reporting units have goodwill balances of $5.2 billion, $134 million and $5 million respectively. During the second quarter of 2010, a decline in the fair value of Anadarko oil and gas exploration and production reporting unit was indicated as a result of the Deepwater Horizon events and general uncertainty arising in connection with the Moratorium and uncertain regulatory impacts. See Note 2 Deepwater Horizon Events and Note 15 Contingencies Deepwater Drilling Moratorium and Other Related Matters in the Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements under Item 8 of this Form 10-K. The Company completed an interim goodwill impairment test of the oil and gas exploration and production reporting unit at June 30, 2010, and the results of the test indicated no impairment. In addition, the Company completed its October 1, 2010, annual goodwill impairment tests with no goodwill impairment indicated. Although Anadarko cannot predict whether goodwill will be impaired in the future, and impairment charges may occur if the Company is unable to replace the value of its depleting asset base or if other adverse events (for example, lower sustained oil and gas prices) reduce the fair value of the associated reporting unit. Also, uncertainty related to the Deepwater Horizon events, difficulty or potential delays in obtaining drilling permits or other unanticipated events could trigger additional goodwill impairment tests in the near term, the results of which may have a material adverse impact on the Company results of operations. Because quoted market prices for the Company reporting units are not available, management must apply judgment in determining the estimated fair value of reporting units for purposes of performing goodwill impairment tests. Management uses all available information to make these fair-value estimates, including the present values of expected future cash flows using discount rates commensurate with the risks associated with the assets and observed for the oil and gas exploration and production reporting unit, and market multiples of earnings before interest, taxes, depreciation and amortization (EBITDA) for the gathering and processing and transportation reporting units. In estimating the fair value of its oil and gas reporting unit, the Company assumes production profiles utilized in its estimation of reserves that are disclosed in the Company supplemental oil and gas disclosures, market prices based on the forward price curve for oil and gas at the test date (adjusted for location and quality differentials), capital and operating costs consistent with pricing and expected inflation rates, and discount rates that management believes a market participant would utilize based upon the risks inherent in Anadarko operations. For the Company gathering and processing and transportation reporting units, the Company estimates fair value by applying an estimated multiple to projected 2011 EBITDA. The Company considered observable transactions in the market and trading multiples for peers in determining an appropriate multiple to apply against the Company projected EBITDA for these reporting units. 76 Table of Contents A lower fair-value estimate in the future for any of these reporting units could result in goodwill impairments. Factors that could trigger a lower fair-value estimate include sustained price declines, cost increases, regulatory or political environment changes, and other changes in market conditions such as decreased prices in market-based transactions for similar assets. Based on the Company most recent goodwill impairment tests, it was concluded that the fair value of each reporting unit substantially exceeded the carrying value of the reporting unit. Therefore, no goodwill impairment was indicated. Impairment of Assets A long-lived asset other than unproved oil and gas property is evaluated for potential impairment whenever events or changes in circumstances indicate that its carrying value may be greater than its future net undiscounted cash flows. Impairment, if any, is measured as the excess of an asset carrying amount over its estimated fair value. The Company utilizes an income approach when market information for the same or similar assets does not exist. This fair-value approach requires use of management best estimates, including asset production profiles and cost expectations, combined with inputs a market participant would use, e.g., prices and discount rates. Derivative Instruments All derivative instruments, other than those that satisfy specific exceptions, are recorded at fair value. If market quotes are not available to estimate fair value, management best estimate of fair value is based on the quoted market price of derivatives with similar characteristics or determined through industry-standard valuation techniques. The Company derivative instruments are either exchange-traded or transacted in an over-the-counter market. Valuation is determined by reference to readily available public data for similar instruments. Option fair values are measured using the Black-Scholes option-pricing model and verified by comparing a sample to market quotes for similar options. Unrealized gains or losses on derivatives are recorded to Anadarko current earnings. Benefit Plan Obligations The Company has non-contributory U.S. defined-benefit pension plans, including both qualified and supplemental plans, and a foreign contributory defined-benefit pension plan. The Company also provides certain health care and life insurance benefits for certain retired employees. Determination of the benefit obligations for the Company defined-benefit pension and postretirement plans impacts the recorded amounts for such obligations on the balance sheet and the amount of benefit expense recorded to the income statement. Accounting for pension and other postretirement benefit obligations involves many assumptions, the most significant of which are the discount rate used to measure the present value of plan benefit obligations, the expected long-term rates of return on plan assets, the rate of future increases in compensation levels of participating employees and the future level of health care costs. Discount rate The discount-rate assumption used by the Company represents an estimate of the interest rate at which the pension and other postretirement obligations could effectively be settled on the measurement date. The Company currently uses a yield-curve analysis to support the discount-rate assumption for the plans. This analysis involves the creation of a hypothetical Aa spot yield curve represented by a series of high-quality, non-callable, marketable bonds, and discounting the estimated cash flows associated with benefits to be provided under each plan using interest rates on the curve that correspond to the expected timing of payment. The present value of future plan benefits determined in this manner is then used to estimate a single plan-specific discount rate that equates such present value with the corresponding future undiscounted cash flows. Application of this method resulted in a weighted-average discount-rate assumption (weighted by the plan-level benefit obligation) at December 31, 2010, of 4.75% for pension plans and 5.25% for other postretirement plans. 77 Table of Contents Expected long-term rate of return The expected long-term rate of return on plan assets assumption was determined using the year-end 2010 pension investment balances by asset class and expected long-term asset allocation. The expected return for each asset class reflects capital-market projections formulated using a forward-looking building-block approach, while also taking into account historical return trends and current market conditions. Equity returns generally reflect long-term expectations of real earnings growth, dividend yield, and inflation. Returns on fixed-income securities are generally developed based on expected inflation, real bond yield, and risk spread (as appropriate), adjusted for the expected effect that changing yields have on the rate return. Other asset class returns are derived from their relationship to the equity and fixed income markets. Because the assumption reflects the Company expectation of average annualized return over a long time horizon, generally, it is not expected to be significantly revised from year to year, even though actual rates of investment return from year to year often experience significant volatility. To measure the net periodic pension cost for its funded pension plans for the year ended December 31, 2010, Anadarko assumed an average long-term rate of return of 7.5%. A variation in this assumption of 25 basis points would have changed the measure of 2010 net periodic pension cost by $3 million, with higher investment return assumption resulting in lower recognized expense. Rate of compensation increases The Company assumption is based on its long-term plans for compensation increases specific to covered employee groups and expected economic conditions. The assumed rate of salary increases includes the effects of merit increases, promotions and general labor cost inflation within the oil and gas industry. The benefit obligations at December 31, 2010 and 2009 reflect the weighted-average assumed rate of increase in long-term compensation levels of 5.0% annually. Health care cost trend rate The health care cost trend assumptions are developed based on historical cost data, the near-term outlook and an assessment of likely long-term trends. A 10% annual rate of increase in the per-capita cost of covered health care benefits was assumed for 2011, decreasing gradually to 5% in 2018 and beyond. Income Taxes The amount of income taxes recorded by the Company requires interpretations of complex rules and regulations of various tax jurisdictions throughout the world. The Company has recognized deferred tax assets and liabilities for temporary differences, operating losses and tax credit carryforwards. The Company routinely assesses the realizability of its deferred tax assets and reduces such assets by a valuation allowance if it is more likely than not that some portion or all of the deferred tax assets will not be realized. The Company routinely assesses potential uncertain tax positions and, if required, establishes accruals for such amounts. The accruals for deferred tax assets and liabilities, including deferred state income tax assets and liabilities, are subject to significant judgment by management and are reviewed and adjusted routinely based on changes in facts and circumstances. Although management considers its tax accruals adequate, material changes in these accruals may occur in the future, based on the progress of ongoing tax audits, changes in legislation and resolution of pending tax matters. 78 Table of Contents
