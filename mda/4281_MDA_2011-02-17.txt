Item 7. Management Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations. (dollars in millions, except per-share amounts and ingot prices; production and shipments in thousands of metric tons [kmt]) Overview Our Business Alcoa is the world leader in the production and management of primary aluminum, fabricated aluminum, and alumina combined, through its active and growing participation in all major aspects of the industry: technology, mining, refining, smelting, fabricating, and recycling. Aluminum is a commodity that is traded on the London Metal Exchange (LME) and priced daily based on market supply and demand. Aluminum and alumina represent more than 80% of Alcoa revenues, and the price of aluminum influences the operating results of Alcoa. Nonaluminum products include precision castings and aerospace and industrial fasteners. Alcoa products are used worldwide in aircraft, automobiles, commercial transportation, packaging, building and construction, oil and gas, defense, and industrial applications. 43 Table of Contents Alcoa is a global company operating in 31 countries. Based upon the country where the point of sale occurred, the U.S. and Europe generated 50% and 27%, respectively, of Alcoa sales in 2010. In addition, Alcoa has investments and operating activities in Australia, Brazil, China, Guinea, Iceland, Russia, and Saudi Arabia, all of which present opportunities for substantial growth. Governmental policies, laws and regulations, and other economic factors, including inflation and fluctuations in foreign currency exchange rates and interest rates, affect the results of operations in these countries. Management Review of 2010 and Outlook for the Future In 2009, management was faced with the challenge of preserving Alcoa future while navigating the Company through a global economic downturn that coupled an unprecedented decline in LME pricing levels (began in the second half of 2008) with a collapse in demand from aluminum product end markets. Management adopted a holistic response to this situation by initiating various actions, including: curtailing additional refinery and smelter capacity (necessitating further layoffs); reducing the quarterly common stock dividend; issuing new equity and debt instruments; optimizing Alcoa business and investment portfolio; and instituting a two-year program to achieve targets related to procurement efficiencies, overhead rationalization, and working capital improvements. All of these actions were aimed at reducing costs, improving cash levels, and preserving liquidity. Upon achieving the established performance targets in year one of this program, management continued to steer the Company through the downturn during 2010, by seeking to increase procurement efficiencies, overhead rationalization, and working capital improvements above and beyond levels that had been achieved in 2009. In addition, management set out to reduce debt and refinance long-term debt set to mature over the next three years. The following financial information reflects the results of management achievements in 2010: Sales of $21,013, a 14% increase over 2009; Selling, general administrative, and other expenses of less than $1,000, the lowest level since 1999; Income from continuing operations of $262, or $0.25 per diluted share, an improvement of $1,247 compared to 2009; Cash from operations of $2,261, highest since 2007; Capital expenditures of $1,015, a reduction of more than $600 from 2009; Cash on hand at the end of the year of $1,543, in excess of $1,000 for the second consecutive year; Reduction in total debt of $654, and $1,413 over the past two years; and Debt-to-capital ratio of 34.9%, a 380 basis point improvement for the second consecutive year. Management is projecting a 12% increase in the global consumption of primary aluminum in 2011, similar to the improvement in 2010. China, India, Brazil, and Russia are all expected to have double-digit increases in aluminum demand. Management also anticipates market conditions for aluminum products in all global end markets to improve, particularly in aerospace, automotive, and industrial gas turbine. On the cost side, energy prices and currency movements are expected to continue to be a challenge. Management has established and is committed to achieving the following specific goals in 2011: sustaining the savings realized in 2010 and 2009 from procurement, overhead, and working capital programs; generating positive cash flow from operations that will exceed capital spending; and maintaining a debt-to-capital ratio between 30% and 35%. Looking ahead over the next three-to-five years, the Company has established aggressive goals, focusing on cost reductions for the upstream operations and significant profitable growth in the midstream and downstream operations. 44 Table of Contents Results of Operations Earnings Summary Income from continuing operations attributable to Alcoa for 2010 was $262, or $0.25 per diluted share, compared with a loss from continuing operations of $985, or $1.06 per share, in 2009. The improvement of $1,247 in continuing operations was primarily due to the following: continued increases in realized prices for alumina and aluminum; ongoing net costs savings and productivity improvements across all segments; and the absence of both a charge associated with a European Commission electricity pricing matter in Italy and a loss on the sale of an equity investment; partially offset by net unfavorable foreign currency movements; higher energy costs; unfavorable changes in LIFO (last in, first out) inventories; additional depreciation charges and operating costs for growth projects; and the absence of gains on the exchange of equity interests and on the acquisition of bauxite and refinery interests. Loss from continuing operations attributable to Alcoa for 2009 was $985, or $1.06 per share, compared with income from continuing operations of $229, or $0.27 per share, in 2008. The decline of $1,214 in continuing operations was primarily due to the following: significant declines in realized prices for alumina and aluminum; large volume decreases in the midstream and downstream operations; a charge associated with a European Commission electricity pricing matter in Italy; a loss on the sale of an equity investment; charges related to 2009 restructuring programs; and higher depreciation and interest charges; all of which was partially offset by procurement and overhead cost savings across all businesses; the absence of the charges associated with 2008 restructuring programs; net favorable foreign currency movements due to a stronger U.S. dollar; favorable LIFO inventory adjustments; various discrete income tax benefits and a significant fluctuation in income taxes due to a change in the results of operations from pretax income to a pretax loss; a gain on the exchange of equity interests; a gain on the acquisition of an entity in the Republic of Suriname; and net income of various other nonoperating items. Net income attributable to Alcoa for 2010 was $254, or $0.24 per share, compared with a net loss of $1,151, or $1.23 per share, in 2009, and a net loss of $74, or $0.10 per share, in 2008. In 2010, the net income of $254 included a loss from discontinued operations of $8, and in 2009 and 2008, the net loss of $1,151 and $74 included a loss from discontinued operations of $166, and $303, respectively. In March 2009, Alcoa announced a series of operational and financial actions, which were in addition to those announced at the end of 2008, to significantly improve Alcoa cost structure and liquidity. Operational actions included procurement efficiencies and overhead rationalization to reduce costs and working capital initiatives to yield significant cash improvements. Financial actions included a reduction in the quarterly common stock dividend from $0.17 per share to $0.03 per share, which began with the dividend paid on May 25, 2009, and the issuance of 172.5 million shares of common stock and $575 in convertible notes that collectively yielded $1,438 in net proceeds. In January 2010, Alcoa announced further operational actions to not only maintain the procurement and overhead savings and working capital improvements achieved in 2009, but to improve on them throughout 2010. Also, a further reduction in capital expenditures was planned in order to achieve the level necessary to sustain operations without sacrificing the quality of Alcoa alumina and aluminum products. In late 2008, management made the decision to reduce Alcoa aluminum and alumina production in response to the then significant economic downturn. As a result of this decision, reductions of 750 kmt, or 18%, of annualized output from Alcoa global smelting system were implemented (includes previous curtailment at Rockdale, TX in June 2008). Accordingly, reductions in alumina output were also initiated with a plan to reduce production by 1,500 kmt-per-year across the global refining system. The aluminum and alumina production curtailments were completed in early 2009 as planned. Smelters in Rockdale (267 kmt-per-year) and Tennessee (215 kmt-per-year) were fully curtailed while another 268 kmt-per-year was partially curtailed at various other locations. The refinery in Point Comfort, TX was partially curtailed by approximately 1,500 kmt-per-year between the end of 2008 and the beginning of 2009 (384 kmt-per-year remains curtailed as of December 31, 2010). In mid-2009, further action became necessary resulting in the decision to fully curtail the Massena East, NY smelter (125 kmt-per-year) and partially curtail the Suralco (Suriname) refinery (480 kmt-per-year represented Alcoa World Alumina and Chemicals (AWAC) previous 55% ownership interest at the time of curtailment total curtailed is approximately 870 kmt). 45 Table of Contents In the first half of 2011, Alcoa plans to restart certain idled potlines at three smelters located in the U.S.: Massena East, NY (three potlines or 125 kmt-per-year); Wenatchee, WA (one potline or 43 kmt-per-year); and Ferndale, WA (Intalco: 36 kmt-per-year). These restarts are expected to increase Alcoa aluminum production by 137 kmt during 2011 and by 204 kmt on an annual basis thereafter and are occurring to help meet anticipated growth in aluminum demand and to meet obligations outlined in power agreements with energy providers. In June 2008, Alcoa temporarily idled half of the aluminum production (three of six operating potlines or 120 kmt) at its Rockdale smelter due to ongoing power supply issues with Rockdale onsite supplier and the uneconomical power that Alcoa was forced to purchase in the open market as a result of such issues. In September 2008, Alcoa announced it was temporarily idling the remaining three potlines, or 147 kmt, as a result of the cumulative effect of operating only half of the smelter, well-known issues regarding the cost and long-term reliability of the power supply, and overall market conditions. In 2008, the earnings impact of the idled potlines was $55 ($90 pretax). Alcoa sought damages and other relief from its power supplier through litigation (in 2010, a trial was held and the verdict resulted in no award of monetary damages to Alcoa although the Company may submit certain disputed amounts (up to $4) to accounting arbitration and may audit the books and record of its power supplier). Additionally, in conjunction with the idling of all six potlines, Alcoa recorded restructuring charges in 2008 of $31 ($48 pretax) mostly for the layoff of approximately 870 employees (see Restructuring and Other Charges below for additional information). Also in June 2008, a major gas supplier to Alcoa Western Australia refining operations (part of Alcoa of Australia) suffered a pipeline rupture and fire, which resulted in a complete shutdown of the supplier gas production operations at a certain hub and a declaration of force majeure by the supplier to all customers. The disruption in gas supply caused an immediate reduction in Alcoa of Australia production capacity and required the purchase of alternative fuel at a much higher cost than the natural gas displaced resulting in a significant negative impact on operations. As a result, shortly thereafter, Alcoa of Australia notified its own customers that it was declaring force majeure under its alumina supply contracts. During the second half of 2008, the supplier partially restored the gas supply to Alcoa of Australia (full restoration occurred in the first half of 2009). In addition, insurance recoveries of $52 were received in the second half of 2008. Net of insurance benefits, Alcoa earnings impact of the disruption in gas supply was $49 ($102 before tax and noncontrolling interest) in 2008. The Alumina segment was impacted by $33 ($47 before tax) and the remaining impact of $29 ($55 before tax) was reflected in Corporate due to Alcoa captive insurance program. In 2009, additional insurance recoveries of $24 were received, which benefited the results of Alcoa by $10 ($24 before tax and noncontrolling interest) and the Alumina segment by $17 ($24 before tax). Alcoa of Australia is part of AWAC, which is 60% owned by Alcoa and 40% owned by Alumina Limited. Sales Sales for 2010 were $21,013 compared with sales of $18,439 in 2009, an improvement of $2,574, or 14%. The increase was mainly driven by a continued rise in realized prices for alumina and aluminum, as a result of significantly higher London Metal Exchange (LME) prices, favorable pricing in the midstream operations, and sales from the smelters in Norway (acquired on March 31, 2009: increase of $332), slightly offset by the absence of sales from divested businesses (Transportation Products Europe and most of Global Foil: decrease of $175) and unfavorable mix in the downstream operations. Sales for 2009 were $18,439 compared with sales of $26,901 in 2008, a decline of $8,462, or 31%. The decrease was primarily due to a drop in realized prices for alumina and aluminum, driven by significantly lower LME prices; volume declines in the midstream and downstream operations due to continued weak end markets; unfavorable foreign currency movements, mostly the result of a weaker euro and Australian dollar; and the absence of sales from the businesses within the former Packaging and Consumer segment ($516 in 2008); all of which was slightly offset by sales from the acquired smelters in Norway (increase of $452). Cost of Goods Sold COGS as a percentage of Sales was 81.7% in 2010 compared with 91.7% in 2009. The percentage was positively impacted by the continued significant rise in realized prices for alumina and aluminum; net cost savings and productivity improvements across all segments; and the absence of a charge related to a European Commission decision on electricity pricing for smelters in Italy ($250); somewhat offset by net unfavorable foreign currency movements due to a weaker U.S. dollar; unfavorable LIFO adjustments, as a result of the considerable rise in 46 Table of Contents LME prices, and a significantly smaller reduction in LIFO inventory quantities; increases in energy costs; and higher operating costs for Brazil growth projects placed in service. COGS as a percentage of Sales was 91.7% in 2009 compared with 82.4% in 2008. The percentage was negatively impacted by significant declines in realized prices for alumina and aluminum, lower demand in the midstream and downstream operations, and a charge related to a European Commission decision on electricity pricing for smelters in Italy ($250). These items were somewhat offset by procurement and overhead cost savings across all businesses, net favorable foreign currency movements due to a stronger U.S. dollar, and positive LIFO adjustments. In 2009, Alcoa recognized $361 ($235 after-tax) in income due to the reductions in LIFO inventory quantities and the considerable drop in LME prices. Of this amount, 71% occurred in the second half of the year. Selling, General Administrative, and Other Expenses SG&A expenses were $961, or 4.6% of Sales, in 2010 compared with $1,009, or 5.5% of Sales, in 2009. The decline of $48 was mostly due to continued reductions in expenses for contractors and consultants; lower deferred compensation, as a result of a decline in plan performance; and decreases in bad debt expense and information technology expenditures. An increase in labor costs, principally due to higher annual incentive and performance compensation and employee benefits costs (employer matching savings plan contributions for U.S. salaried participants were suspended during 2009) somewhat offset the aforementioned expense reductions. SG&A expenses were $1,009, or 5.5% of Sales, in 2009 compared with $1,167, or 4.3% of Sales, in 2008. The decline of $158 was primarily due to reductions in labor costs, mainly as a result of implemented severance programs; decreases in expenses for travel, contractors and consultants, information technology, selling and marketing, and various other administrative items as part of Alcoa cost reduction initiatives; the absence of the businesses within the former Packaging and Consumer segment ($37 in 2008); and a decrease in bad debt expense; all of which was partially offset by an increase in deferred compensation, mostly the result of the plans improved performance, and an increase due to SG&A of the acquired smelters in Norway. Research and Development Expenses R&D expenses were $174 in 2010 compared with $169 in 2009 and $246 in 2008. The increase in 2010 as compared to 2009 was mainly driven by incremental increases across varying expenses necessary to support R&D activities. The decline in 2009 as compared to 2008 was principally due to the implementation of Alcoa cost reduction initiatives and the absence of the businesses within the former Packaging and Consumer segment ($3 in 2008). Provision for Depreciation, Depletion, and Amortization The provision for DD&A was $1,450 in 2010 compared with $1,311 in 2009. The increase of $139, or 11%, was principally the result of the assets placed into service during the second half of 2009 related to the Juruti bauxite mine development and S o Lu refinery expansion in Brazil, the smelters in Norway (acquired on March 31, 2009), the new Bohai (China) flat-rolled product facility, and a high-quality coated sheet line at the Samara (Russia) facility, slightly offset by the cessation in DD&A due to the decision to permanently shutdown and demolish two U.S. smelters in early 2010 (see Restructuring and Other Charges below). The provision for DD&A was $1,311 in 2009 compared with $1,234 in 2008. The increase of $77, or 6%, was mostly due to the acquired smelters in Norway and assets placed into service during 2009, including the Juruti bauxite mine and S o Luis refinery in Brazil, the new Bohai flat-rolled product facility, and a high-quality coated sheet line at the Samara facility. These increases were slightly offset as a result of the cessation of DD&A, which began in January 2009, related to the Global Foil and Transportation Products Europe businesses due to the classification of these businesses as held for sale and a reduction in DD&A as a result of the extension of depreciable lives for the majority of rolled products and hard alloy extrusions locations based upon a review, which was completed in mid-2008, of estimated useful lives ($11). 47 Table of Contents Restructuring and Other Charges Restructuring and other charges for each year in the three-year period ended December 31, 2010 were comprised of the following: 2010 2009 2008 Asset impairments $ 139 $ 54 $ 670 Layoff costs 43 186 183 Other exit costs 58 37 109 Reversals of previously recorded layoff and other exit costs (33 ) (40 ) (23 ) Restructuring and other charges $ 207 $ 237 $ 939 2010 Actions In 2010, Alcoa recorded Restructuring and other charges of $207 ($130 after-tax and noncontrolling interests), which were comprised of the following components: $127 ($80 after-tax and noncontrolling interests) in asset impairments and $46 ($29 after-tax and noncontrolling interests) in other exit costs related to the permanent shutdown and planned demolition of certain idled structures at five U.S. locations (see below); $43 ($29 after-tax and noncontrolling interests) for the layoff of approximately 830 employees (625 in the Engineered Products and Solutions segment; 75 in the Primary Metals segment; 25 in the Flat-Rolled Products segment; 15 in the Alumina segment; and 90 in Corporate); $22 ($14 after-tax) in net charges (including $12 ($8 after-tax) for asset impairments) related to divested and to be divested businesses (Automotive Castings, Global Foil, Transportation Products Europe, and Packaging and Consumer) for, among other items, the settlement of a contract with a former customer, foreign currency movements, working capital adjustments, and a tax indemnification; $2 ($2 after-tax and noncontrolling interests) for various other exit costs; and $33 ($24 after-tax and noncontrolling interests) for the reversal of prior periods layoff reserves, including a portion of those related to the Portovesme smelter in Italy due to the execution of a new power agreement. In early 2010, management approved the permanent shutdown and demolition of the following structures, each of which was previously temporarily idled for different reasons: the Eastalco smelter located in Frederick, MD (capacity of 195 kmt-per-year); the smelter located in Badin, NC (capacity of 60 kmt-per-year); an aluminum fluoride plant in Point Comfort, TX; a paste plant and cast house in Massena, NY; and one potline at the smelter in Warrick, IN (capacity of 40 kmt-per-year). This decision was made after a comprehensive strategic analysis was performed to determine the best course of action for each facility. Factors leading to this decision included current market fundamentals, cost competitiveness, other existing idle capacity, required future capital investment, and restart costs, as well as the elimination of ongoing holding costs. The asset impairments of $127 represent the write off of the remaining book value of properties, plants, and equipment related to these facilities. Additionally, remaining inventories, mostly operating supplies, were written down to their net realizable value resulting in a charge of $8 ($5 after-tax and noncontrolling interests), which was recorded in COGS. The other exit costs of $46 represent $30 ($19 after-tax and noncontrolling interests) in asset retirement obligations and $14 ($9 after-tax) in environmental remediation, both triggered by the decision to permanently shutdown and demolish these structures, and $2 ($1 after-tax and noncontrolling interests) in other related costs. As of December 31, 2010, approximately 630 of the 830 employees were terminated. The remaining terminations are expected to be completed by the end of 2011. In 2010, cash payments of $21 were made against layoff reserves related to 2010 restructuring programs. 2009 Actions In 2009, Alcoa recorded Restructuring and other charges of $237 ($151 after-tax and noncontrolling interests), which were comprised of the following components: $177 ($121 after-tax and noncontrolling interests) for the layoff of approximately 6,600 employees (2,980 in the Engineered Products and Solutions segment; 2,190 in the Flat-Rolled Products segment; 1,080 in the Primary Metals segment; 180 in the Alumina segment; and 170 in Corporate) to address the impact of the global economic downturn on Alcoa businesses and a $9 ($6 after-tax) curtailment charge due to the remeasurement of pension plans as a result of the workforce reductions; $41 ($20 after-tax) in adjustments to the Global Foil and Transportation Products Europe businesses held for sale due to unfavorable foreign currency movements for both businesses and a change in the estimated fair value for the Global Foil business 48 Table of Contents and $13 ($11 after-tax) in other asset impairments; $18 ($12 after-tax) for the write-off of previously capitalized third-party costs related to potential business acquisitions due to the adoption of changes to accounting for business combinations and net charges of $19 ($10 after-tax and noncontrolling interests) for various other items, such as accelerated depreciation and lease termination costs for shutdown facilities; and $40 ($29 after-tax and noncontrolling interests) for reversals of previously recorded layoff and other exit costs due to normal attrition and changes in facts and circumstances. As of December 31, 2010, approximately 5,500 of the 6,000 employees were terminated. The total number of employees associated with 2009 restructuring programs was updated to reflect changes in plans (e.g., the previously mentioned new power agreement at the Portovesme smelter in Italy see 2010 Activity above), natural attrition, and other factors. The remaining terminations are expected to be completed by the end of 2011. In 2010 and 2009, cash payments of $60 and $62, respectively, were made against layoff reserves related to 2009 restructuring programs. 2008 Actions In late 2008, Alcoa took specific actions to reduce costs and strengthen its portfolio, partly due to the economic downturn. Such actions included targeted reductions, curtailments, and plant closures and consolidations, which will reduce headcount by approximately 5,300, resulting in layoff charges of $138 ($98 after-tax and noncontrolling interests), asset impairments of $156 ($88 after-tax and noncontrolling interests), and other exit costs of $58 ($57 after-tax). The significant components of these actions were as follows: As a result of market conditions, the Primary Metals segment reduced production by 483 thousand metric tons (kmt) and the Alumina segment reduced production by a total of 1,500 kmt (fully implemented in early 2009; further reductions occurred later in 2009). These production curtailments as well as targeted reductions will result in the elimination of approximately 1,110 positions totaling $23 in layoff costs. Asset impairments of $116 related to these two segments were also recognized, including the write off of $84 in engineering costs related to a 1,500 kmt planned expansion of Jamalco Clarendon, Jamaica refinery. The Flat-Rolled Products segment was restructured through the following actions: Restructuring and downsizing of the Mill Products businesses in Europe and North America, resulting in severance charges of $53 for the reduction of approximately 850 positions; Alignment of production with demand at operations in Russia, through the elimination of approximately 1,400 positions resulting in severance charges of $7; The shutdown of the Foil business in Bohai, resulting in severance charges of $6 for the reduction of approximately 400 positions, asset impairments of $24, and other exits costs of $54, primarily related to lease termination costs. The Engineered Products and Solutions segment was restructured through the following actions: Exiting of the Auto Cast Wheel business, through the closure of the only remaining facility, which employed approximately 270, by June 2009 for severance costs of $2; Consolidation of operations in the Building and Construction Systems business to maximize operating efficiencies and align capacity with the decline in the commercial building and construction markets, resulting in severance charges of $6 for the elimination of approximately 400 positions; Alignment of production with demand across the Power and Propulsion business, resulting in the reduction of approximately 250 positions for a cost of $6; Optimization of the Global Hard Alloy Extrusion operations, resulting in severance charges of $13 for a headcount reduction of approximately 240 and asset impairments of $3; Other severance charges of $8 for the elimination of approximately 250 positions, asset impairments of $13, and other exit costs of $1. In order to reduce overhead serving various businesses, approximately 130 positions were eliminated at Corporate, resulting in severance charges of $14 and other exits costs of $3. 49 Table of Contents In addition to the above actions, Alcoa intends to sell its Global Foil (the Sabi nigo, Spain and Shanghai, China plants were sold in late 2009) and Transportation Products Europe (sold in 2010) businesses in order to streamline its portfolio. As a result of this decision, the assets and related liabilities of the Global Foil and Transportation Products Europe businesses were classified as held for sale. Asset impairments of $129 ($100 after-tax) and $52 ($49 after-tax) were recognized to reflect the estimated fair values of the Global Foil and Transportation Products Europe businesses, respectively. Also, Alcoa and Orkla ASA agreed to exchange their stakes in the Sapa AB and Elkem Aluminium ANS joint ventures. This portfolio action resulted in an impairment charge of $333 ($223 after-tax) to reflect the estimated fair value of Alcoa investment in Sapa AB. Earlier in 2008, Alcoa recorded $48 ($31 after-tax) in charges, which consisted of $44 ($29 after-tax) for the layoff of approximately 870 employees and related curtailment of postretirement benefits and $4 ($2 after-tax) for other exit costs, associated with the complete production curtailment of the Rockdale, TX smelter (267 kmt) due to ongoing power supply issues with Rockdale onsite supplier and the uneconomical power that Alcoa was forced to purchase in the open market as a result of such issues. Also during 2008, Alcoa recorded a loss of $43 ($32 after-tax) on the sale of its Packaging and Consumer businesses. The remaining net charges in 2008 were comprised of $1 ($1 after-tax and noncontrolling interests) for layoff related to a reduction in headcount of approximately 30, $4 for other exit costs ($6 after-tax), and $23 ($15 after-tax and noncontrolling interests) for reversals of previously recorded costs, slightly more than half of which related to the reversal of a reserve related to a shutdown facility. As of December 31, 2010, the terminations associated with 2008 restructuring programs were essentially complete. The total number of employees associated with 2008 restructuring programs was updated during 2010 to reflect changes in plans, natural attrition, and other factors resulting in terminations of approximately 6,000 (previously 6,200). In 2010 and 2009, cash payments of $12 and $112, respectively, were made against layoff reserves related to 2008 restructuring programs. Alcoa does not include Restructuring and other charges in the results of its reportable segments. The pretax impact of allocating such charges to segment results would have been as follows: 2010 2009 2008 Alumina $ 12 $ 5 $ 89 Primary Metals 145 30 94 Flat-Rolled Products (11 ) 65 273 Engineered Products and Solutions 18 64 104 Packaging and Consumer - - 45 Segment total 164 164 605 Corporate 43 73 334 Total restructuring and other charges $ 207 $ 237 $ 939 Interest Expense Interest expense was $494 in 2010 compared with $470 in 2009, resulting in an increase of $24, or 5%. The increase was principally caused by a $69 decline in interest capitalized, mainly the result of placing the Juruti and S o Lu growth projects in service during the second half of 2009; and a $14 net charge related to the early retirement of various outstanding notes ($42 in purchase premiums paid partially offset by a $28 gain for in-the-money interest rate swaps); mostly offset by a 7% lower average debt level, primarily due to the absence of commercial paper resulting from Alcoa improved liquidity position; and lower amortization expense of financing costs, principally related to the fees paid (fully amortized in October 2009) for the former $1,900 364-day senior unsecured revolving credit facility. 50 Table of Contents Interest expense was $470 in 2009 compared with $407 in 2008, resulting in an increase of $63, or 15%. The increase was primarily due to a 10% higher average debt level, mostly the result of $575 in convertible notes issued in March 2009 and increased borrowings on loans in Brazil (began in April 2008) related to the Juruti, S o Lu s, and Estreito growth projects; and a significant increase in the amortization of debt costs, mainly due to a $66 beneficial conversion option related to the convertible notes and $43 in fees paid for the $1,900 364-day senior unsecured revolving credit facility (entered into in October 2008 and expired in October 2009); both of which were slightly offset by a decrease in the weighted average interest rate of Alcoa debt portfolio. Other Expenses (Income), net Other expenses, net was $5 in 2010 compared with Other income, net of $161 in 2009. The change of $166 was mostly due to the absence of a $188 gain on the Elkem/Sapa AB exchange transaction, a $92 gain related to the acquisition of a BHP Billiton subsidiary in the Republic of Suriname, and a $22 gain on the sale of property in Vancouver, WA; net foreign currency losses; and a smaller improvement in the cash surrender value of company-owned life insurance; partially offset by the absence of both a $182 realized loss on the sale of the Shining Prospect investment and an equity loss related to Alcoa former 50% equity stake in Elkem; and a net favorable change of $25 in mark-to-market derivative contracts. Other income, net was $161 in 2009 compared with $59 in 2008. The increase of $102 was mainly the result of a $188 gain on the Elkem/Sapa AB exchange transaction; net foreign currency gains due to a stronger U.S. dollar; net gains related to the improvement in the cash surrender value of company-owned life insurance; a $92 gain related to the acquisition of a BHP Billiton subsidiary in the Republic of Suriname; and a $22 gain on the sale of property in Vancouver, WA. These positive impacts were partially offset by a $182 realized loss on the sale of the Shining Prospect investment; a decline in the value of mark-to-market derivative contracts; a decrease in equity income related to Alcoa share of the results of Elkem, Sapa AB, and Shining Prospect prior to the exchange and sale of these investments; the absence of a 2008 negotiated partial refund of an indemnification payment ($39); and an estimated loss on excess power at the Ferndale, WA smelter ($30). Income Taxes Alcoa effective tax rate was 26.9% (provision on income) in 2010 compared with the U.S. federal statutory rate of 35%. The effective tax rate differs from the U.S. federal statutory rate primarily due to foreign income taxed in lower rate jurisdictions, a $57 discrete income tax benefit for the reversal of a valuation allowance as a result of previously restricted net operating losses of a foreign subsidiary now available, a $24 discrete income tax benefit related to a Canadian provincial tax law change permitting a tax return to be filed in U.S. dollars, and a $13 net discrete income tax benefit for various other items, partially offset by a $79 discrete income tax charge as a result of a change in the tax treatment of federal subsidies received related to prescription drug benefits provided under certain retiree health care benefit plans that were determined to be actuarially equivalent to Medicare Part D and a $19 discrete income tax charge based on settlement discussions of several matters with international taxing authorities (this amount represents a decrease to Alcoa unrecognized tax benefits) . Alcoa effective tax rate was 38.3% (benefit on a loss) in 2009 compared with the U.S. federal statutory rate of 35%. The effective tax rate differs from the U.S. federal statutory rate principally due to a $12 income tax benefit related to the noncontrolling interests share of the gain associated with the acquisition of a BHP Billiton subsidiary in the Republic of Suriname and the following discrete tax items: a $71 benefit for the reorganization of an equity investment; a $34 benefit for the reversal of a valuation allowance on foreign deferred tax assets; a $31 benefit for a tax rate change (from 15% to 18%) in Iceland; a $31 benefit related to a Canadian tax law change allowing a tax return to be filed in U.S. dollars; a $10 benefit related to a change in the sale structure of two locations included in the Global Foil business than originally anticipated; and a $7 benefit related to the Elkem/Sapa AB exchange transaction. Partially offsetting these benefits were items related to smelter operations in Italy, which included a $41 valuation allowance placed on existing deferred tax assets and charges not tax benefitted as follows: $250 related to a recent decision by the European Commission on electricity pricing, $15 for environmental remediation, and $15 for layoffs. Alcoa effective tax rate was 43.2% (provision on income) in 2008 compared with the U.S. federal statutory rate of 35%. The effective tax rate differs from the U.S. federal statutory rate primarily due to the following income tax charges: $73 for the asset impairments included in the 2008 restructuring program; $28 due to a decrease in deferred 51 Table of Contents tax assets of the Iceland operations as a result of an applicable tax rate change (from 18% to 15%); a net $19 associated with the sale of the Packaging and Consumer businesses, mainly due to the allocation of sale proceeds to higher tax rate jurisdictions as opposed to the allocation previously contemplated, somewhat offset by changes in tax assumptions surrounding transaction costs and the finalization of the divestiture of certain foreign locations. These charges were partially offset by foreign income taxed in lower rate jurisdictions and a $20 discrete income tax benefit related to the filing of the 2007 U.S. income tax return. Management anticipates that the effective tax rate in 2011 will be approximately 30%. However, changes in the current economic environment, tax legislation, currency fluctuations, and the results of operations in certain taxing jurisdictions may cause this estimated rate to fluctuate. Noncontrolling Interests Net income attributable to noncontrolling interests was $138 in 2010 compared with $61 in 2009. The increase of $77 was mostly due to higher earnings at AWAC, which is owned 60% by Alcoa and 40% by Alumina Limited. The improved earnings at AWAC were attributed primarily to a continued rise in realized prices, partially offset by net unfavorable foreign currency movements due to a weaker U.S. dollar, higher depreciation expense and operating costs related to the Juruti and S o Lu growth projects placed into service in the second half of 2009, and the absence of a gain recognized on the acquisition of a BHP Billiton subsidiary in the Republic of Suriname. Net income attributable to noncontrolling interests was $61 in 2009 compared with $221 in 2008. The decline of $160 was principally due to lower earnings at AWAC, mainly driven by a significant drop in realized prices, somewhat offset by the gain related to the acquisition of a BHP Billiton subsidiary in the Republic of Suriname and the absence of the impact of the 2008 gas outage in Western Australia. Loss From Discontinued Operations Loss from discontinued operations in 2010 was $8 comprised of an additional loss of $6 ($9 pretax) related to the wire harness and electrical portion of the EES business as a result of a contract settlement with a former customer of this business and an additional loss of $2 ($4 pretax) related to the electronics portion of the EES business for the settling of working capital, which was not included in the divestiture transaction. Loss from discontinued operations in 2009 was $166 comprised of a $129 ($168 pretax) loss on the divestiture of the wire harness and electrical portion of the EES business, a $9 ($13 pretax) loss on the divestiture of the electronics portion of the EES business, and the remainder was for the operational results of the EES business prior to the divestitures. Loss from discontinued operations in 2008 was $303 comprised of asset impairments of $162 ($225 pretax) to reflect the estimated fair value of the EES business and a net operating loss of $141 ($199 pretax), which included restructuring charges of $39 ($53 pretax) for headcount reductions of approximately 6,200 and a charge of $16 ($25 pretax) for obsolete inventory. In late 2008, Alcoa reclassified the EES business to discontinued operations based on the decision to divest the business. The divestiture of the wire harness and electrical portion of the EES business was completed in June 2009 and the divestiture of the electronics portion of the EES business was completed in December 2009. The results of the Engineered Products and Solutions segment were reclassified to reflect the movement of the EES business into discontinued operations. Segment Information Alcoa operations consist of four worldwide reportable segments: Alumina, Primary Metals, Flat-Rolled Products, and Engineered Products and Solutions (the Packaging and Consumer segment no longer contains any operations as the businesses within this segment were divested during 2008). Segment performance under Alcoa management reporting system is evaluated based on a number of factors; however, the primary measure of performance is the after-tax operating income (ATOI) of each segment. Certain items such as the impact of LIFO inventory accounting; 52 Table of Contents interest expense; noncontrolling interests; corporate expense (general administrative and selling expenses of operating the corporate headquarters and other global administrative facilities, along with depreciation and amortization on corporate-owned assets); restructuring and other charges; discontinued operations; and other items, including intersegment profit eliminations and other metal adjustments, differences between tax rates applicable to the segments and the consolidated effective tax rate, the results of the soft alloy extrusions business in Brazil, and other nonoperating items such as foreign currency transaction gains/losses and interest income are excluded from segment ATOI. ATOI for all reportable segments totaled $1,424 in 2010, $(234) in 2009, and $2,199 in 2008. See Note Q to the Consolidated Financial Statements in Part II Item 8 of this Form 10-K for additional information. The following discussion provides shipments, sales, and ATOI data for each reportable segment and production data for the Alumina and Primary Metals segments for each of the three years in the period ended December 31, 2010. Alumina 2010 2009 2008 Alumina production (kmt) 15,922 14,265 15,256 Third-party alumina shipments (kmt) 9,246 8,655 8,041 Third-party sales $ 2,815 $ 2,161 $ 2,924 Intersegment sales 2,212 1,534 2,803 Total sales $ 5,027 $ 3,695 $ 5,727 ATOI $ 301 $ 112 $ 727 This segment (known as upstream operations) consists of Alcoa worldwide alumina system, including the mining of bauxite, which is then refined into alumina. Alumina is mainly sold directly to internal and external smelter customers worldwide or is sold to customers who process it into industrial chemical products. A portion of this segment third-party sales are completed through the use of agents, alumina traders, and distributors. Slightly more than half of Alcoa alumina production is sold under supply contracts to third parties worldwide, while the remainder is used internally. In 2010, alumina production increased by 1,657 kmt compared to 2009. The increase was mainly driven by the Point Comfort, TX refinery as most of the 1,500 kmt-per-year curtailment initiated between the fourth quarter of 2008 and the first quarter of 2009 has been restored. In addition, production included the continued ramp-up of the S o Lu s, Brazil refinery expansion, which began in late 2009 (the Alumina segment share is approximately 1,100 kmt-per-year) and the 45% interest in the Suralco (Suriname) refinery acquired in mid-2009. In 2009, alumina production decreased by 991 kmt compared to 2008. The reduction was mostly the result of the effects of curtailments initiated in late 2008 through early 2009, which included approximately 1,500 kmt-per-year at the Point Comfort refinery and approximately 480 kmt-per-year at the Suralco refinery (represented AWAC previous 55% ownership interest at the time of curtailment total curtailed is approximately 870 kmt). Partially offsetting the curtailments was increased production at the following refineries (all set production records in 2009): Jamalco (Jamaica), Pinjarra and Wagerup (Australia), and S o Luis, where ramp-up of the 2,100 kmt expansion began in late 2009. Production also increased due to additional capacity of approximately 600 kmt from the acquisition (total acquired was approximately 990 kmt 390 was curtailed) of BHP Billiton 45% interest in Suralco on July 31, 2009 (100% of the Suralco refinery operations were reflected in this segment beginning August 1, 2009). Third-party sales for the Alumina segment rose 30% in 2010 compared with 2009, primarily related to a 29% increase in realized prices, driven by significantly higher LME prices, coupled with a 7% increase in volumes. Third-party sales for this segment declined 26% in 2009 compared with 2008, principally due to a 35% drop in realized prices, driven by significantly lower LME prices, and unfavorable foreign currency movements due to a weaker Australian dollar, both of which were somewhat offset by an increase in volumes. 53 Table of Contents Intersegment sales for the Alumina segment climbed 44% in 2010 compared with 2009, mainly as a result of higher realized prices and an increase in demand from the Primary Metals segment. Intersegment sales for this segment dropped 45% in 2009 compared with 2008, mostly due to a drop in realized prices and a reduction in demand from the Primary Metals segment. ATOI for the Alumina segment improved $189 in 2010 compared with 2009, mostly due to the significant increase in realized prices and continued benefits of cost savings initiatives, particularly lower caustic costs. These positive impacts were partially offset by net unfavorable foreign currency movements due to a weaker U.S. dollar, particularly against the Australian dollar; higher depreciation expense and operating costs (includes the impact of a failure of a ship unloader) associated with the start-up of the Juruti bauxite mine and the S o Lu refinery expansion, both of which began in the second half of 2009; the absence of a $60 gain recognized on the acquisition of BHP Billiton interest in Suralco; and continued higher fuel oil costs. ATOI for this segment declined 85% in 2009 compared with 2008, principally due to the significant drop in realized prices; a tax settlement related to an equity investment in Brazil ($30); and an increase in depreciation expense as a result of growth projects placed into service mid-to-late 2009 in Brazil (Juruti bauxite mine and S o Luis refinery); all of which was partially offset by net procurement and overhead cost savings across most regions, net favorable foreign currency movements due to a stronger U.S. dollar, a $60 gain recognized on the acquisition of BHP Billiton interest in Suralco, and a positive impact related to the 2008 gas outage in Western Australia (absence of $69 in costs partially offset by $19 less in insurance recoveries). In 2011, productivity improvements will continue to be a focus but higher maintenance costs due to scheduled outages in Australia and Brazil are expected. Also, it is anticipated that the ramp-up of S o Lu will stabilize without additional significant, non-recurring operating costs. Primary Metals 2010 2009 2008 Aluminum production (kmt) 3,586 3,564 4,007 Third-party aluminum shipments (kmt) 2,845 3,038 2,926 Alcoa average realized price per metric ton of aluminum $ 2,356 $ 1,856 $ 2,714 Third-party sales $ 7,070 $ 5,252 $ 8,021 Intersegment sales 2,597 1,836 3,927 Total sales $ 9,667 $ 7,088 $ 11,948 ATOI $ 488 $ (612 ) $ 931 This segment (known as upstream operations) consists of Alcoa worldwide smelter system. Primary Metals receives alumina, mostly from the Alumina segment, and produces primary aluminum used by Alcoa fabricating businesses, as well as sold to external customers, aluminum traders, and commodity markets. Results from the sale of aluminum powder, scrap, and excess power are also included in this segment, as well as the results of aluminum derivative contracts and buy/resell activity. Primary aluminum produced by Alcoa and used internally is transferred to other segments at prevailing market prices. The sale of primary aluminum represents more than 90% of this segment third-party sales. Buy/resell activity refers to when this segment purchases metal from external or internal sources and resells such metal to external customers or the midstream and downstream segments in order to maximize smelting system efficiency and to meet customer requirements. At December 31, 2010, Alcoa had 878 kmt of idle capacity on a base capacity of 4,518 kmt. In 2010, idle capacity decreased 356 kmt compared to 2009 due to the restart of 32 kmt of previously curtailed production capacity at a smelter in Brazil, the decision to permanently curtail the smelters located in Frederick, MD (195 kmt-per-year) and Badin, NC (60 kmt-per-year) and one potline (40 kmt-per-year) at the smelter in Warrick, IN, and the restart of 61 kmt of previously curtailed production capacity at various smelters, slightly offset by the full curtailment of the Fusina 54 Table of Contents smelter (44 kmt-per-year) in Italy as a result of uneconomical power prices. In June 2010, Alcoa halted production at the Avil smelter (93 kmt-per-year) in Spain due to torrential flooding. Production was restarted a few months after the flood and the smelter was at full operating rate by the end of 2010. Base capacity dropped 295 kmt between December 31, 2010 and 2009 due to the previously mentioned permanent curtailments. The decision to permanently curtail these facilities was made after a comprehensive strategic analysis was performed to determine the best course of action for each facility. Factors leading to this decision included current market fundamentals, cost competitiveness, other existing idle capacity, required future capital investment, and restart costs, as well as the elimination of ongoing holding costs. At December 31, 2009, Alcoa had 1,234 kmt of idle capacity on a base capacity of 4,813 kmt. In 2009, idle capacity increased by 480 kmt compared to 2008 due to the completion of targeted curtailment reductions, including the Tennessee smelter (215 kmt-per-year), the Massena East, NY smelter (125 kmt-per-year), and 140 kmt at various other smelters, in response to the significant decline in LME prices and aluminum demand both as a result of the then global economic downturn. Base capacity rose by 282 kmt at December 31, 2009 as compared to December 31, 2008 due to the March 31, 2009 acquisition of two smelters in Norway, in which Alcoa previously held a 50% equity interest. In 2010, aluminum production increased by 22 kmt, mostly due to the smelters located in Norway, as well as a number of small increases at other smelters, but was virtually offset by the smelter curtailments in Tennessee, Massena East, and Fusina and the halted production at the Avil smelter. In 2009, aluminum production declined 443 kmt, mainly the result of the effects of smelter curtailments that began mid-2008, including the smelters in Rockdale (267 kmt-per-year), Tennessee, and Massena East, all of which was partially offset by an increase in production at the Iceland smelter (344 kmt-per-year), as this smelter was not at full capacity until April 2008, and the acquisition of the Lista (94 kmt-per-year) and Mosj en (188 kmt-per-year) smelters in Norway. Third-party sales for the Primary Metals segment climbed 35% in 2010 compared with 2009, mainly due to a 27% rise in average realized prices, driven by 31% higher average LME prices, and the acquisition of the smelters located in Norway (increase of $332), slightly offset by a decline in both buy/resell activity and volumes. Third-party sales for this segment decreased 35% in 2009 compared with 2008, mostly the result of a 32% drop in realized prices, driven by a 35% decline in LME prices, slightly offset by sales from the acquired smelters in Norway (increase of $452). Intersegment sales for the Primary Metals segment rose 41% in 2010 compared with 2009, mainly as a result of an increase in realized prices, driven by the higher LME, and an increase in buy/resell activity. Intersegment sales for this segment declined 53% in 2009 compared with 2008, mostly due to a drop in realized prices and a decline in volume due to lower demand from the midstream and downstream operations. ATOI for the Primary Metals segment improved $1,100 in 2010 compared with 2009, principally related to the significant increase in realized prices; the absence of a charge related to a European Commission decision on electricity pricing for smelters in Italy ($250); and continued benefits from cost savings initiatives, particularly coke and pitch; somewhat offset by much higher alumina and energy prices; the absence of a gain related to Alcoa acquisition of the other 50% of the smelters in Norway ($112); and net unfavorable foreign currency movements due to a weaker U.S. dollar. ATOI for this segment declined $1,543 in 2009 compared with 2008, primarily due to the significant drop in realized prices; a charge related to a European Commission decision on electricity pricing for smelters in Italy ($250); a decline in intersegment sales volume; the impact of curtailing operations; and additional power costs related to smelters in Italy as a result of the termination of the then existing power tariff structure under legislative authority of the Italian Parliament ($15); all of which was partially offset by procurement and overhead cost savings across all regions; lower costs for alumina; net favorable foreign currency movements due to a stronger U.S. dollar; and a gain related to the acquisition of two smelters in Norway ($112). In 2011, the following trends are expected to continue: pricing will follow a 15-day lag on the LME, higher energy and raw material costs, and productivity improvements. Also, Alcoa plans to restart certain idled potlines at three smelters located in the U.S.: Massena East (three potlines or 125 kmt-per-year); Wenatchee, WA (one potline or 43 kmt-per-year); and Ferndale, WA (Intalco: 36 kmt-per-year). These restarts are expected to increase Alcoa aluminum production by 137 kmt during 2011 and by 204 kmt on an annual basis thereafter and are occurring to help meet anticipated growth in aluminum demand and to meet obligations outlined in power agreements with energy providers. 55 Table of Contents Flat-Rolled Products 2010 2009 2008 Third-party aluminum shipments (kmt) 1,658 1,831 2,221 Third-party sales $ 6,277 $ 6,069 $ 8,966 Intersegment sales 180 113 218 Total sales $ 6,457 $ 6,182 $ 9,184 ATOI $ 220 $ (49 ) $ (3 ) This segment (known as midstream operations) principal business is the production and sale of aluminum plate and sheet. A small portion of this segment operations still relate to foil (most of this business was exited during 2009 and 2010 through shutdown actions and divestitures) produced from one plant in Brazil. This segment includes rigid container sheet (RCS), which is sold directly to customers in the packaging and consumer market and is used to produce aluminum beverage cans. Seasonal increases in RCS sales are generally experienced in the second and third quarters of the year. This segment also includes sheet and plate used in the aerospace, commercial transportation, building and construction, and distribution markets (mainly used in the production of machinery and equipment and consumer durables), which is sold directly to customers and through distributors. Approximately one-half of the third-party sales in this segment consist of RCS, while the other one-half of third-party sales are derived from sheet and plate and foil used in industrial markets. While the customer base for flat-rolled products is large, a significant amount of sales of RCS, sheet, and plate is to a relatively small number of customers. Third-party sales for the Flat-Rolled Products segment increased 3% in 2010 compared with 2009, principally due to better pricing and higher volumes in most key end markets, partially offset by lower volumes in the segment can sheet business, largely due to a decision in early 2010 to curtail sales to a North American customer and the absence of sales ($125 in 2009) from two foil plants (Spain and China), which were divested in late 2009. Third-party sales for this segment declined 32% in 2009 compared with 2008, primarily due to a drop in prices, attributable to unfavorable changes in the variable components of certain customer contracts, and a reduction in volumes across most businesses, both of which were mostly the result of weak end markets in Europe and North America, and unfavorable foreign currency movements due to a weaker euro and Australian dollar. ATOI for the Flat-Rolled Products segment improved $269 in 2010 compared with 2009, mainly the result of both favorable pricing and increased productivity across all businesses due to cost savings initiatives, including the operations in Russia as results turned profitable. ATOI for this segment fell $46 in 2009 compared with 2008, primarily as a result of reduced volumes across most businesses; the previously mentioned drop in prices; and an increase in depreciation expense as a result of the new coating line commissioned in Samara (Russia) and the new flat-rolled product facility in Bohai (China); all of which were mostly offset by procurement and overhead cost savings and net favorable foreign currency movements due to a stronger U.S. dollar. In 2011, the following trends are expected to continue: strengthening demand in most regions around the globe, higher energy costs, and productivity improvements. Also, improvements in product mix are anticipated as a result of the optimization of this segment portfolio. Engineered Products and Solutions 2010 2009 2008 Third-party aluminum shipments (kmt) 197 180 257 Third-party sales $ 4,584 $ 4,689 $ 6,199 ATOI $ 415 $ 315 $ 533 This segment (known as downstream operations) includes titanium, aluminum, and super alloy investment castings; forgings and fasteners; aluminum wheels; integrated aluminum structural systems; and architectural extrusions used in the aerospace, automotive, building and construction, commercial transportation, and power generation markets. These products are sold directly to customers and through distributors. Additionally, hard alloy extrusions products, which are also sold directly to customers and through distributors, serve the distribution, aerospace, automotive, and commercial transportation markets. In 2008, the Electrical and Electronic Solutions business was classified as discontinued operations; therefore, all periods presented exclude the results of this business (this business was sold during 2009). 56 Table of Contents In July 2010, Alcoa completed an acquisition of the commercial building and construction business of a privately-held company, Traco, for $77. This business, located in Cranberry, Pennsylvania, employing 650 people, is a premier manufacturer of windows and doors for the commercial building and construction market and generated sales of approximately $100 in 2009. The assets and liabilities of this business were included in the Engineered Products and Solutions segment as of the end of July 2010 and this business results of operations were included in this segment since the beginning of August 2010. Third-party sales for the Engineered Products and Solutions segment decreased 2% in 2010 compared with 2009, primarily due to unfavorable pricing and mix across all businesses; lower volumes for the fasteners, power and propulsion, and building and construction businesses; the absence of sales related to the divestiture of the Transportation Products Europe business in April 2010 (decrease of $50); and unfavorable foreign currency movements due to a weaker euro. These negative impacts were mostly offset by higher volumes in the wheels and forgings businesses and sales from the newly acquired business mentioned above ($37). Third-party sales for this segment declined 24% in 2009 compared with 2008, mostly due to lower volumes (aluminum and nonaluminum) across all businesses because of weak end markets, lower pricing in the building and construction sector, and unfavorable foreign currency movements due to a weaker euro. ATOI for the Engineered Products and Solutions segment climbed 32% in 2010 compared with 2009, mainly due to productivity improvements and cost reduction initiatives across all businesses, partially offset by unfavorable pricing and mix. ATOI for this segment fell 41% in 2009 compared with 2008, principally the result of lower volumes across all businesses and lower pricing, partially offset by procurement and overhead cost savings realized in all businesses. In 2011, improvements in key end markets, such as aerospace and commercial transportation, are anticipated, while productivity improvements are expected to continue. Packaging and Consumer 2010 2009 2008 Third-party aluminum shipments (kmt) - - 19 Third-party sales $ - $ - $ 516 ATOI $ - $ - $ 11 The businesses within this segment were sold to Rank Group Limited in 2008; therefore, this segment no longer contains any operations. Prior to the sale of these businesses, this segment included consumer, foodservice, and flexible packaging products; food and beverage closures; and plastic sheet and film for the packaging industry. The principal products in this segment included aluminum foil; plastic wraps and bags; plastic beverage and food closures; flexible packaging products; thermoformed plastic containers; and extruded plastic sheet and film. Consumer products were marketed under brands including Reynolds Wrap , Diamond , Baco , and Cut-Rite . Seasonal increases generally occurred in the second and fourth quarters of the year for such products as consumer foil and plastic wraps and bags, while seasonal slowdowns for closures generally occurred in the fourth quarter of the year. Products were generally sold directly to customers, consisting of supermarkets, beverage companies, food processors, retail chains, and commercial foodservice distributors. Reconciliation of ATOI to Consolidated Net Income (Loss) Attributable to Alcoa Items required to reconcile total segment ATOI to consolidated net income (loss) attributable to Alcoa include: the impact of LIFO inventory accounting; interest expense; noncontrolling interests; corporate expense (general administrative and selling expenses of operating the corporate headquarters and other global administrative facilities, along with depreciation and amortization on corporate-owned assets); restructuring and other charges; discontinued operations; and other items, including intersegment profit eliminations and other metal adjustments, differences between tax rates applicable to the segments and the consolidated effective tax rate, the results of the soft alloy extrusions business in Brazil, and other nonoperating items such as foreign currency transaction gains/losses and interest income. 57 Table of Contents The following table reconciles total segment ATOI to consolidated net income (loss) attributable to Alcoa: 2010 2009 2008 Total segment ATOI $ 1,424 $ (234 ) $ 2,199 Unallocated amounts (net of tax): Impact of LIFO (16 ) 235 (7 ) Interest expense (321 ) (306 ) (265 ) Noncontrolling interests (138 ) (61 ) (221 ) Corporate expense (291 ) (304 ) (328 ) Restructuring and other charges (134 ) (155 ) (693 ) Discontinued operations (8 ) (166 ) (303 ) Other (262 ) (160 ) (456 ) Consolidated net income (loss) attributable to Alcoa $ 254 $ (1,151 ) $ (74 ) The significant changes in the reconciling items between total segment ATOI and consolidated net income (loss) attributable to Alcoa for 2010 compared with 2009 consisted of: a change in the Impact of LIFO due to higher prices for alumina and metal, both of which were driven by a significant rise in LME prices, and a significantly smaller reduction in LIFO inventory quantities; an increase in Interest expense, primarily due to a decline in interest capitalized (mainly the result of placing the Juruti and S o Lu growth projects in service during the second half of 2009) and a $9 net charge related to the early retirement of various outstanding notes ($27 in purchase premiums paid partially offset by an $18 gain for in-the-money interest rate swaps), mostly offset by a 7% lower average debt level (primarily due to the absence of commercial paper resulting from Alcoa improved liquidity position) and lower amortization expense of financing costs (principally related to the fees paid (fully amortized in October 2009) for the former $1,900 364-day senior unsecured revolving credit facility); an increase in Noncontrolling interests, mainly due to higher earnings at AWAC, primarily driven by a continued rise in realized prices, partially offset by net unfavorable foreign currency movements due to a weaker U.S. dollar, higher depreciation and operating costs related to the Juruti and S o Lu growth projects placed into service in the second half of 2009, and the absence of a gain recognized on the acquisition of a BHP Billiton subsidiary in the Republic of Suriname; a decline in Corporate expense, primarily due to continued reductions in expenses for contractors and consultants, lower deferred compensation (as a result of a decline in plan performance), a decrease in bad debt expense, and a decrease in information technology expenditures, somewhat offset by an increase in labor costs (principally due to higher annual incentive and performance compensation and employee benefits costs (employer matching savings plan contributions for U.S. salaried participants were suspended during 2009)); a decrease in Restructuring and other charges, mainly due to lower layoff charges, somewhat offset by higher asset impairments and other exit costs, primarily related to the permanent shutdown and planned demolition of certain idled structures at five U.S. locations; a change in Discontinued operations, mostly the result of the absence of both a $129 loss (an additional $6 loss was recognized in 2010) on the divestiture of the wire harness and electrical portion of the EES business (June 2009) and a $9 loss on the divestiture of the electronics portion of the EES business (December 2009); and a change in Other, mainly due to a net income tax charge (includes discrete tax items) related to the difference in the consolidated effective tax rate and the estimated tax rates applicable to the segments, net foreign currency losses, the absence of a $21 favorable adjustment for the finalization of the estimated fair value of the former Sapa AB joint venture, and a smaller improvement in the cash surrender value of company-owned life insurance; partially offset by the absence of a $118 realized loss on the sale of the former Shining Prospect investment and favorable changes in mark-to-market derivative contracts. 58 Table of Contents The significant changes in the reconciling items between total segment ATOI and consolidated net loss attributable to Alcoa for 2009 compared with 2008 consisted of: a change in the Impact of LIFO due to lower prices for alumina and metal, both of which were driven by a significant drop in LME prices, and reductions in LIFO inventory quantities, which caused a partial liquidation of the lower cost LIFO inventory base; an increase in Interest expense, primarily due to a 10% higher average debt level (mostly the result of $575 in convertible notes issued in March 2009 and increased borrowings on loans in Brazil (began in April 2008) related to the Juruti, S o Lu s, and Estreito growth projects) and a significant increase in the amortization of debt costs (mainly due to a $66 beneficial conversion option related to the convertible notes and $43 in fees paid for the $1,900 364-day senior unsecured revolving credit facility (entered into in October 2008 and expired in October 2009)), both of which were slightly offset by a decrease in the weighted average interest rate of Alcoa debt portfolio; a decrease in Noncontrolling interests, principally due to lower earnings at AWAC, mainly driven by a significant drop in realized prices, somewhat offset by the gain related to the acquisition of a BHP Billiton subsidiary in the Republic of Suriname and the absence of the impact of the 2008 gas outage in Western Australia; a decline in Corporate expense, primarily due to reductions in labor costs (mainly as a result of implemented severance programs) and decreases in expenses for travel, contractors and consultants, information technology, and various other administrative items as part of Alcoa cost reduction initiatives, all of which was partially offset by an increase in deferred compensation, mostly the result of the plans improved performance; a change in Restructuring and other charges, reflecting, in 2009, $20 in adjustments to the Global Foil and Transportation Products Europe businesses held for sale due to unfavorable foreign currency movements for both businesses and a change in the estimated fair value for the Global Foil business; $12 for the write-off of previously capitalized third-party costs related to potential business acquisitions due to the adoption of changes to accounting for business combinations; and the remainder for the layoff of approximately 6,600 employees to address the impact of the global economic downturn on Alcoa businesses and a related curtailment charge due to the remeasurement of pension plans as a result of the workforce reductions, asset impairments, accelerated depreciation and lease termination costs for shutdown facilities, and reversals of previously recorded layoff and other exit costs due to normal attrition and changes in facts and circumstances; compared with, in 2008, $372 in asset impairments to reflect the estimated fair values of Alcoa investment in Sapa AB and the Global Foil and Transportation Products Europe businesses, as a result of management decision to divest these assets; a $32 loss on the sale of the Packaging and Consumer businesses; and the remainder for the layoff of approximately 6,200 employees, additional asset impairments, and other exit costs due to the global economic downturn and curtailed operations, and the reversal of previously recorded costs, slightly more than half of which related to a shutdown facility; a change in Discontinued operations, reflecting a $129 loss on the divestiture of the wire harness and electrical portion of the EES business, a $9 loss on the divestiture of the electronics portion of the EES business, and the remainder was for the operational results of the EES business prior to the divestitures in 2009, compared with asset impairments of $162 to reflect the estimated fair value of the EES business and a net operating loss of $141, which included restructuring charges of $39 for headcount reductions of approximately 6,200 and a charge of $16 for obsolete inventory, for EES in 2008; and a change in Other, mainly due to income tax benefits related to the difference in the consolidated effective tax rate and tax rates applicable to the segments, including various discrete income tax items, net foreign currency gains due to a stronger U.S. dollar, and a $21 adjustment for the finalization of the estimated fair value of the Sapa AB joint venture, all of which was partially offset by a $118 realized loss on the sale of the Shining Prospect investment and the absence of a 2008 negotiated partial refund of an indemnification payment ($24). 59 Table of Contents Environmental Matters See the Environmental Matters section of Note N to the Consolidated Financial Statements in Part II Item 8 of this Form 10-K. Liquidity and Capital Resources Alcoa takes a very disciplined approach to cash management and strengthening of its balance sheet. In 2010, management continued to face the significant challenge of maintaining this approach while providing the Company with the necessary liquidity to operate effectively as the global economy continues to recover from the economic downturn that began in 2008. In response to changes in the economic markets across the globe in the second half of 2008, management initiated the following actions to conserve cash and preserve liquidity: greater scrutiny over the daily management of Alcoa cash position; higher risk tolerance on raw materials with lower minimum order quantities and lower carrying levels; targeted headcount reductions across the globe; a global salary and hiring freeze (lifted at the beginning of 2010); suspension of the existing share repurchase program (expired in December 2010); and the addition of a new 364-day $1,900 revolving credit facility (expired in October 2009). A number of changes were also made to Alcoa capital expenditures strategy as follows: capital expenditure approval levels were lowered dramatically; growth projects were halted where it was deemed economically feasible; and all non-critical capital expenditures were stopped. Capital expenditures are deemed critical if they maintain Alcoa compliance with the law, keep a facility operating, or satisfy customer requirements if the benefits outweigh the costs. The planned sale or shutdown of various businesses contributed positively to Alcoa liquidity position in 2009. In March 2009, Alcoa announced an additional series of operational and financial actions to significantly improve the Company cost structure and liquidity. Operational actions included procurement efficiencies and overhead rationalization to reduce costs and working capital initiatives to yield significant cash improvements. Financial actions included a reduction in the quarterly common stock dividend from $0.17 per share to $0.03 per share, which began with the dividend paid on May 25, 2009, and the issuance of 172.5 million shares of common stock and $575 in convertible notes that collectively yielded $1,438 in net proceeds. In January 2010, Alcoa announced further operational actions to not only maintain the procurement and overhead savings and working capital improvements achieved in 2009, but to improve on them throughout 2010. Also, a further reduction in capital expenditures was planned in order to achieve the level necessary to sustain operations without sacrificing the quality of Alcoa alumina and aluminum products. Along with the foregoing actions, cash provided from operations and financing activities is expected to be adequate to cover Alcoa current operational and business needs. For a discussion of long-term liquidity, see Contractual Obligations and Off-Balance Sheet Arrangements. Cash from Operations Cash from operations in 2010 was $2,261 compared with $1,365 in 2009, resulting in an increase of $896, or 66%. The improvement of $896 was primarily due to significantly better operating results, partially offset by a $870 cash outflow associated with working capital. The major components of the change in working capital were as follows: a $770 increase in receivables, primarily as a result of higher sales in three of the four reportable segments and a significant rise in LME prices; a $1,473 increase in inventories, mostly due to a build-up of levels to meet anticipated demand and higher input costs; a $960 increase in accounts payable, trade, principally the result of higher purchasing needs and timing of vendor payments; and a $649 increase in taxes, including income taxes, mainly due to a $310 receivable recorded in 2009 and the receipt of $347 in 2010, both related to a federal income tax refund for the carryback of Alcoa 2009 net loss to prior tax years. 60 Table of Contents Cash from operations in 2009 was $1,365 compared with $1,234 in 2008, resulting in an increase of $131, or 11%. The improvement of $131 was principally related to a $1,639 cash inflow associated with working capital, $395 in lower pension contributions, and a positive change of $103 in noncurrent assets and noncurrent liabilities, all of which was mostly offset by significantly lower earnings (including the effects of non-cash income and expenses) and $147 in cash used for discontinued operations. The components of the change in working capital were as follows: a $443 decrease in receivables, primarily as a result of lower sales across all businesses and heightened collection efforts; a $1,611 reduction in inventories, mostly due to lower levels of inventory on-hand in response to a significant drop in demand, curtailed production at Alcoa refineries and smelters, and reduced costs for certain raw materials; a $223 decline in prepaid expenses and other current assets; a $653 decrease in accounts payable, trade, principally the result of fewer purchasing needs and declining commodity prices; a $187 increase in accrued expenses, mainly driven by a charge related to a European Commission decision on electricity pricing for smelters; and a decline of $172 in taxes, including income taxes, mostly due to the change from an operating income position to an operating loss position. Financing Activities Cash used for financing activities was $952 in 2010 compared with cash provided from financing activities of $37 in 2009 and $1,478 in 2008. The use of cash in 2010 was primarily due to $1,757 in payments on long-term debt, mostly related to $511 for the repayment of 7.375% Notes due 2010 as scheduled, $825 for the early retirement of all of the 6.50% Notes due 2011 and a portion of the 6.00% Notes due 2012 and 5.375% Notes due 2013, and $287 related to previous borrowings on the loans supporting the S o Lu refinery expansion and Juruti bauxite mine development in Brazil; $125 in dividends paid to shareholders; net cash paid to noncontrolling interests of $94, all of which relates to Alumina Limited share of AWAC; $66 in acquisitions of noncontrolling interests, mainly the result of the $60 paid to redeem the convertible securities of a subsidiary that were held by Alcoa former partner related to the joint venture in Saudi Arabia; and a change of $44 in short-term borrowings; partially offset by $1,126 in additions to long-term debt, $998 for the issuance of 6.150% Notes due 2020 and $76 related to borrowings under the loans that support the Estreito hydroelectric power project in Brazil. The source of cash in 2009 was principally the result of $1,049 in additions to long-term debt, mainly driven by net proceeds of $562 from the issuance of $575 in convertible notes and $394 in borrowings under loans that support the S o Lu refinery expansion, Juruti bauxite mine development, and Estreito hydroelectric power project in Brazil; net proceeds of $876 from the issuance of 172.5 million shares of common stock; and net cash received from noncontrolling interests of $340, principally related to Alumina Limited share of AWAC; all of which was mostly offset by a $1,535 decrease in outstanding commercial paper, partly due to tightening in the credit markets and a reduction in market availability as a result of the change in Alcoa credit ratings in early 2009; $228 in dividends paid to shareholders; a $292 net change in short-term borrowings ($1,300 was borrowed and repaid under Alcoa $1,900 364-day senior unsecured revolving credit facility in early 2009 and $255 in new loans to support Alcoa Alum nio export operations was borrowed and repaid during 2009), mostly the result of repayments of working capital loans in Spain and Asia and a $155 decrease in accounts payable settlement arrangements; and payments on long-term debt of $156, including $97 related to the loans in Brazil for growth projects. The source of cash in 2008 was primarily due to $2,253 in additions to long-term debt, mainly driven by net proceeds of $1,489 from the July 2008 public debt offering and $721 in borrowings under the loans in Brazil for growth projects; a $679 increase in outstanding commercial paper to support operations and capital spending; net cash received from noncontrolling interests of $348, principally related to Alumina Limited share of AWAC; and $177 in proceeds from employees exercising their stock options; all of which was partially offset by $1,082 for the repurchase of common stock; $556 in dividends paid to shareholders; payments on long-term debt of $204, mainly due to a repayment of $150 for 6.625% Notes due March 2008; and a $96 net change in short-term borrowings, mostly the result of a $78 decrease in accounts payable settlement arrangements. Alcoa maintains a Five-Year Revolving Credit Agreement, dated as of October 2, 2007 (the Credit Agreement ), with a syndicate of lenders and issuers named therein. The Credit Agreement provides for a senior unsecured revolving 61 Table of Contents credit facility (the Credit Facility ), the proceeds of which are to be used to provide working capital or for other general corporate purposes of Alcoa, including support of Alcoa commercial paper program. Subject to the terms and conditions of the Credit Agreement, Alcoa may from time to time request increases in lender commitments under the Credit Facility, not to exceed $500 in aggregate principal amount, and may also request the issuance of letters of credit, subject to a letter of credit sub-limit of $500 under the Credit Facility. At December 31, 2010, the capacity of the Credit Facility was $3,425 (original amount was $3,250). In October 2008, Lehman Commercial Paper Inc. (LCPI), a lender under the Credit Agreement with $150 in commitments, filed for bankruptcy protection under Chapter 11 of the United States Bankruptcy Code. It is not certain if LCPI will honor its obligations under the Credit Agreement. The total capacity of the Credit Facility, excluding LCPI commitment, is $3,275. The Credit Facility matures on October 2, 2012, unless extended or earlier terminated in accordance with the provisions of the Credit Agreement. Alcoa may make two one-year extension requests during the term of the Credit Facility, with any extension being subject to the lender consent requirements set forth in the Credit Agreement. In order to maintain the Credit Facility, Alcoa pays a fee of 0.125% per annum, based on Alcoa long-term debt ratings as of December 31, 2010, of the total commitment. The Credit Facility is unsecured and amounts payable under it will rank pari passu with all other unsecured, unsubordinated indebtedness of Alcoa. Borrowings under the Credit Facility may be denominated in U.S. dollars or euros. Loans will bear interest at (i) a base rate or (ii) a rate equal to LIBOR plus an applicable margin based on the credit ratings of Alcoa outstanding senior unsecured long-term debt. The applicable margin on LIBOR loans will be 0.475% per annum based on Alcoa long-term debt ratings as of December 31, 2010. Loans may be prepaid without premium or penalty, subject to customary breakage costs. The Credit Agreement includes the following covenants, among others, (a) a leverage ratio, (b) limitations on Alcoa ability to incur liens securing indebtedness for borrowed money, (c) limitations on Alcoa ability to consummate a merger, consolidation or sale of all or substantially all of its assets, and (d) limitations on Alcoa ability to change the nature of its business. The obligation of Alcoa to pay amounts outstanding under the Credit Facility may be accelerated upon the occurrence of an Event of Default as defined in the Credit Agreement. Such Events of Default include, among others, (a) Alcoa failure to pay the principal of, or interest on, borrowings under the Credit Facility, (b) any representation or warranty of Alcoa in the Credit Agreement proving to be materially false or misleading, (c) Alcoa breach of any of its covenants contained in the Credit Agreement, and (d) the bankruptcy or insolvency of Alcoa. There were no amounts outstanding under the Credit Facility at December 31, 2010 and 2009. Also, no amounts were borrowed under the Credit Facility during 2010 and 2009. On October 14, 2008, Alcoa entered into a Revolving Credit Agreement (RCA-3) with a syndicate of lenders. RCA-3 provided a $1,150 senior unsecured revolving credit facility (RCF-3), which matured on October 12, 2009. In October and November 2008, Alcoa increased the capacity of RCF-3 by $500 and $250, respectively, as provided for under RCA-3. Alcoa paid a total of $43 in financing costs, which were deferred and amortized to interest expense over the term of the facility, for the initial capacity under RCF-3 and for the $750 in increased capacity. In early 2009, Alcoa borrowed $1,300 under RCF-3 to support its operations during the then global economic downturn. The $1,300 was repaid on March 24, 2009 with the net proceeds from the issuance of convertible notes and common stock. In March 2008, Alcoa filed an automatic shelf registration statement with the Securities and Exchange Commission for an indeterminate amount of securities for future issuance. This shelf registration statement replaced Alcoa existing shelf registration statement. As of December 31, 2010 and 2009, $3,075 and $2,075, respectively, in senior debt securities were issued under the current shelf registration statement. Alcoa cost of borrowing and ability to access the capital markets are affected not only by market conditions but also by the short- and long-term debt ratings assigned to Alcoa debt by the major credit rating agencies. 62 Table of Contents On May 7, 2010, Standard and Poor Ratings Services (S&P) affirmed the following ratings for Alcoa: long-term debt at BBB- and short-term debt at A-3. S&P did not change the current outlook from negative. On March 30, 2010, Moody Investors Service (Moody s) confirmed the following ratings for Alcoa: long-term debt at Baa3 and short-term debt at Prime-3. Moody removed all ratings from credit watch and the current outlook was changed from stable to negative. On February 22, 2010, Fitch Ratings (Fitch) affirmed the following ratings for Alcoa: long-term debt at BBB- and short-term debt at F3. Fitch did not change the current outlook from negative. Investing Activities Cash used for investing activities was $1,272 in 2010 compared with $721 in 2009 and $2,410 in 2008. The use of cash in 2010 was primarily due to $1,015 in capital expenditures (includes costs related to environmental control in new and expanded facilities of $87), 44% of which related to growth projects, including the Estreito hydroelectric power project, Juruti bauxite mine development, and S o Lu refinery expansion; $352 in additions to investments, mostly for the contributions of $197 related to the joint venture in Saudi Arabia and purchase of $126 in available-for-sale securities held by Alcoa captive insurance company; and $72 for acquisitions, principally related to the purchase of a new building and construction systems business; slightly offset by $141 in sales of investments, virtually all of which related to the sale of available-for-sale securities held by Alcoa captive insurance company. The use of cash in 2009 was mainly due to $1,622 in capital expenditures (includes costs related to environmental control in new and expanded facilities of $59), 68% of which related to growth projects, including the S o Lu refinery expansion, Juruti bauxite mine development, and Estreito hydroelectric power project; $181 in additions to investments, mostly for $83 in available-for-sale securities held by Alcoa captive insurance company and an $80 interest in a new joint venture in Saudi Arabia; and a net cash outflow of $65 for the divestiture of assets and businesses, including a cash outflow of $204 for the EES business, cash inflows of $111 for the collection of a note related to the 2007 sale of the Three Oaks mine and the sale of property in Vancouver, WA, and a cash inflow of $20 for the sale of the Shanghai (China) foil plant; all of which was partially offset by $1,031 from sales of investments, mostly related to the receipt of $1,021 for the sale of the Shining Prospect investment; and a net cash inflow of $112 from acquisitions, mainly due to $97 from the acquisition of a BHP Billiton subsidiary in the Republic of Suriname and $18 from the Elkem/Sapa AB exchange transaction. The use of cash in 2008 was principally due to $3,438 in capital expenditures (includes costs related to environmental control in new and expanded facilities of $241), 58% of which related to growth projects, including the S o Lu refinery expansion, Juruti bauxite mine development, Estreito hydroelectric power project, and flat-rolled products projects in Bohai (China) and Russia; $1,303 in additions to investments, mostly related to the $1,200 investment made in Shining Prospect Pte. Ltd. to acquire common stock of Rio Tinto plc; and $417 in acquisitions for the purchase of two aerospace fastener manufacturing businesses ($276), the buyout of outstanding noncontrolling interests in Bohai ($79) and Russia ($15), and a contingent payment made to Camargo Corr a Group related to the 2003 acquisition of 40.9% of Alcoa Alum nio S.A. ($47); all of which was partially offset by $2,710 in proceeds from the sale of assets and businesses, mostly due to the $2,651 in net proceeds from the sale of the businesses within the former Packaging and Consumer segment. 63 Table of Contents Contractual Obligations and Off-Balance Sheet Arrangements Contractual Obligations. Alcoa is required to make future payments under various contracts, including long-term purchase obligations, debt agreements, and lease agreements. Alcoa also has commitments to fund its pension plans, provide payments for other postretirement benefit plans, and finance capital projects. As of December 31, 2010, a summary of Alcoa outstanding contractual obligations is as follows (these contractual obligations are grouped in the same manner as they are classified in the Statement of Consolidated Cash Flows in order to provide a better understanding of the nature of the obligations and to provide a basis for comparison to historical information): Total 2011 2012-2013 2014-2015 Thereafter Operating activities: Energy-related purchase obligations $ 20,165 $ 1,442 $ 2,354 $ 2,219 $ 14,150 Raw material purchase obligations 3,243 1,572 902 249 520 Other purchase obligations 1,076 180 352 291 253 Operating leases 948 244 326 179 199 Interest related to total debt 4,966 473 930 758 2,805 Estimated minimum required pension funding 2,215 445 1,030 740 - Other postretirement benefit payments 2,585 275 555 540 1,215 Layoff and other restructuring payments 116 55 30 31 - Deferred revenue arrangements 133 8 16 16 93 Uncertain tax positions 59 - - - 59 Financing activities: Total debt 9,139 323 1,954 819 6,043 Dividends to shareholders - - - - - Investing activities: Capital projects 1,301 645 563 93 - Equity contributions 940 407 533 - - Payments related to acquisitions - - - - - Totals $ 46,886 $ 6,069 $ 9,545 $ 5,935 $ 25,337 Obligations for Operating Activities Energy-related purchase obligations consist primarily of electricity and natural gas contracts with expiration dates ranging from less than 1 year to 40 years. The majority of raw material and other purchase obligations have expiration dates of 24 months or less. Certain purchase obligations contain variable pricing components, and, as a result, actual cash payments may differ from the estimates provided in the preceding table. Operating leases represent multi-year obligations for certain computer equipment, plant equipment, vehicles, and buildings. Interest related to total debt is based on interest rates in effect as of December 31, 2010 and is calculated on debt with maturities that extend to 2037. The effect of outstanding interest rate swaps, which are accounted for as fair value hedges, are included in interest related to total debt. As of December 31, 2010, these hedges effectively convert the interest rate from fixed to floating on $1,065 of debt through 2018. As the contractual interest rates for certain debt and interest rate swaps are variable, actual cash payments may differ from the estimates provided in the preceding table. Estimated minimum required pension funding and postretirement benefit payments are based on actuarial estimates using current assumptions for discount rates, long-term rate of return on plan assets, rate of compensation increases, and health care cost trend rates. The minimum required contributions for pension funding are estimated to be $445 for 2011 and $530 for 2012. The funding estimate is $500 for 2013, $410 for 2014 and $330 for 2015. The expected pension contributions in 2011 and later reflect the impacts of the Pension Protection Act of 2006 and the Worker, Retiree, and Employer Recovery Act of 2008. Pension contributions are expected to continue to decline if all actuarial assumptions are realized and remain the same in the future. In January 2011, Alcoa contributed 36,518,563 newly issued shares of its common stock (valued at $600) to a master trust that holds the assets of certain U.S. defined benefit 64 Table of Contents pension plans in a private placement transaction. Additionally, Alcoa estimates that it will contribute an additional $200 in cash to its U.S pension plans during 2011. Together, these contributions satisfy the minimum required and provide additional funding for Alcoa to maintain an approximately 80% funded status of its U.S. pension plans (the preceding table only reflects the minimum contributions required by law). Other postretirement benefit payments are expected to approximate $275 annually, net of the estimated subsidy receipts related to Medicare Part D, and are reflected in the preceding table through 2020. Alcoa has determined that it is not practicable to present pension funding and other postretirement benefit payments beyond 2015 and 2020, respectively. Layoff and other restructuring payments primarily relate to severance costs and are expected to be paid within one year. Amounts scheduled to be paid beyond one year are related to ongoing site remediation work, special termination benefit payments, and lease termination costs. Deferred revenue arrangements require Alcoa to deliver alumina over the specified contract period through 2027. While these obligations are not expected to result in cash payments, they represent contractual obligations for which the Company would be obligated if the specified product deliveries could not be made. Uncertain tax positions taken or expected to be taken on an income tax return may result in additional payments to tax authorities. The amount in the preceding table includes interest and penalties accrued related to such positions as of December 31, 2010. The total amount of uncertain tax positions is included in the Thereafter column as the Company is not able to reasonably estimate the timing of potential future payments. If a tax authority agrees with the tax position taken or expected to be taken or the applicable statute of limitations expires, then additional payments will not be necessary. Obligations for Financing Activities Total debt amounts in the preceding table represent the principal amounts of all outstanding debt, including short-term borrowings and long-term debt. Maturities for long-term debt extend to 2037. Alcoa has historically paid quarterly dividends on its preferred and common stock. Including dividends on preferred stock, Alcoa paid $125 in dividends to shareholders during 2010. Because all dividends are subject to approval by Alcoa Board of Directors, amounts are not included in the preceding table until such authorization has occurred. As of December 31, 2010, there were 1,022,025,965 and 546,024 shares of outstanding common stock and preferred stock, respectively. The annual preferred stock dividend is at the rate of $3.75 per share and the annual common stock dividend is $0.12. Obligations for Investing Activities Capital projects in the preceding table only include amounts approved by management as of December 31, 2010. Funding levels may vary in future years based on anticipated construction schedules of the projects. It is expected that significant expansion projects will be funded through various sources, including cash provided from operations. Total capital expenditures are anticipated to be approximately $1,500 in 2011. Equity contributions represent Alcoa committed investment related to a joint venture in Saudi Arabia. In December 2009, Alcoa signed an agreement to enter into a joint venture to develop a new aluminum complex in Saudi Arabia, comprised of a bauxite mine, alumina refinery, aluminum smelter, and rolling mill, which will require the Company to contribute approximately $1,100 over a four-year period (2010 through 2013). As of December 31, 2010, Alcoa has made equity contributions of $160. The timing of the amounts included in the preceding table may vary based on changes in anticipated construction schedules of the project. Payments related to acquisitions are based on provisions in certain acquisition agreements that state additional funds are due to the seller from Alcoa if the businesses acquired achieve stated financial and operational thresholds. Amounts are only presented in the preceding table if it is has been determined that payment is more likely than not to occur. In 65 Table of Contents connection with the 2005 acquisition of two fabricating facilities in Russia, Alcoa could be required to make contingent payments of approximately $50 through 2015, but are not included in the preceding table as they have not met such standard. Off-Balance Sheet Arrangements. As of December 31, 2010, Alcoa has maximum potential future payments for guarantees issued on behalf of certain third parties of $553. These guarantees expire in 2015 through 2027 and relate to project financing for hydroelectric power projects in Brazil and the aluminum complex in Saudi Arabia. Alcoa also has outstanding bank guarantees related to legal, customs duties, and leasing obligations, among others, which expire at various dates, that total $425 at December 31, 2010. Alcoa has outstanding letters of credit in the amount of $350 as of December 31, 2010. These letters of credit relate primarily to workers compensation, derivative contracts, and leasing obligations, and expire at various dates, mostly in 2011. Alcoa also has outstanding surety bonds primarily related to customs duties, self-insurance, and legal obligations. The total amount committed under these bonds, which automatically renew or expire at various dates, mostly in 2011, was $154 at December 31, 2010. Alcoa had a program to sell a senior undivided interest in certain customer receivables, without recourse, on a continuous basis to a third-party for cash (up to $250). This program was renewed on October 29, 2009 and was due to expire on October 28, 2010. On March 26, 2010, Alcoa terminated this program and repaid the $250 originally received in 2009. In light of the adoption of accounting changes related to the transfer of financial assets, had the securitization program not been terminated, it would have resulted in a $250 increase in both Receivables from customers and Short-term borrowings on Alcoa Consolidated Balance Sheet. As of December 31, 2009, Alcoa derecognized $250 in Receivables from customers on its Consolidated Balance Sheet under this program. Alcoa serviced the customer receivables for the third-party at market rates; therefore, no servicing asset or liability was recorded. Also on March 26, 2010, Alcoa entered into two arrangements with third parties to sell certain customer receivables outright without recourse. In December 2010, Alcoa sold $192 in customer receivables under these arrangements. As of December 31, 2010, $150 of the sold receivables remain uncollected. Alcoa is servicing the customer receivables for the third parties at market rates; therefore, no servicing asset or liability was recorded. Critical Accounting Policies and Estimates The preparation of the Consolidated Financial Statements in accordance with accounting principles generally accepted in the United States of America requires management to make certain judgments, estimates, and assumptions regarding uncertainties that affect the amounts reported in the Consolidated Financial Statements and disclosed in the accompanying Notes. Areas that require significant judgments, estimates, and assumptions include accounting for derivatives and hedging activities; environmental and litigation matters; asset retirement obligations; the testing of goodwill, equity investments, and properties, plants, and equipment for impairment; estimating fair value of businesses to be divested; pension plans and other postretirement benefits obligations; stock-based compensation; and income taxes. Management uses historical experience and all available information to make these judgments, estimates, and assumptions, and actual results may differ from those used to prepare the Company Consolidated Financial Statements at any given time. Despite these inherent limitations, management believes that Management Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations and the Consolidated Financial Statements and accompanying Notes provide a meaningful and fair perspective of the Company. A summary of the Company significant accounting policies is included in Note A to the Consolidated Financial Statements in Part II Item 8 of this Form 10-K. Management believes that the application of these policies on a consistent basis enables the Company to provide the users of the Consolidated Financial Statements with useful and reliable information about the Company operating results and financial condition. 66 Table of Contents Derivatives and Hedging. Derivatives are held for purposes other than trading and are part of a formally documented risk management program. For derivatives designated as fair value hedges, Alcoa measures hedge effectiveness by formally assessing, at least quarterly, the historical high correlation of changes in the fair value of the hedged item and the derivative hedging instrument. For derivatives designated as cash flow hedges, Alcoa measures hedge effectiveness by formally assessing, at least quarterly, the probable high correlation of the expected future cash flows of the hedged item and the derivative hedging instrument. The ineffective portions of both types of hedges are recorded in sales or other income or expense in the current period. If the hedging relationship ceases to be highly effective or it becomes probable that an expected transaction will no longer occur, future gains or losses on the derivative are recorded in other income or expense. Alcoa accounts for interest rate swaps related to its existing long-term debt and hedges of firm customer commitments for aluminum as fair value hedges. As a result, the fair values of the derivatives and changes in the fair values of the underlying hedged items are reported in other current and noncurrent assets and liabilities in the Consolidated Balance Sheet. Changes in the fair values of these derivatives and underlying hedged items generally offset and are recorded each period in sales or interest expense, consistent with the underlying hedged item. Alcoa accounts for hedges of foreign currency exposures and certain forecasted transactions as cash flow hedges. The fair values of the derivatives are recorded in other current and noncurrent assets and liabilities in the Consolidated Balance Sheet. The effective portions of the changes in the fair values of these derivatives are recorded in other comprehensive income and are reclassified to sales, cost of goods sold, or other income or expense in the period in which earnings are impacted by the hedged items or in the period that the transaction no longer qualifies as a cash flow hedge. These contracts cover the same periods as known or expected exposures, generally not exceeding five years. If no hedging relationship is designated, the derivative is marked to market through earnings. Cash flows from derivatives are recognized in the Statement of Consolidated Cash Flows in a manner consistent with the underlying transactions. Environmental Matters. Expenditures for current operations are expensed or capitalized, as appropriate. Expenditures relating to existing conditions caused by past operations, which will not contribute to future revenues, are expensed. Liabilities are recorded when remediation costs are probable and can be reasonably estimated. The liability may include costs such as site investigations, consultant fees, feasibility studies, outside contractors, and monitoring expenses. Estimates are generally not discounted or reduced by potential claims for recovery. Claims for recovery are recognized as agreements are reached with third parties. The estimates also include costs related to other potentially responsible parties to the extent that Alcoa has reason to believe such parties will not fully pay their proportionate share. The liability is continuously reviewed and adjusted to reflect current remediation progress, prospective estimates of required activity, and other factors that may be relevant, including changes in technology or regulations. Litigation Matters. For asserted claims and assessments, liabilities are recorded when an unfavorable outcome of a matter is deemed to be probable and the loss is reasonably estimable. Management determines the likelihood of an unfavorable outcome based on many factors such as the nature of the matter, available defenses and case strategy, progress of the matter, views and opinions of legal counsel and other advisors, applicability and success of appeals processes, and the outcome of similar historical matters, among others. Once an unfavorable outcome is deemed probable, management weighs the probability of estimated losses, and the most reasonable loss estimate is recorded. If an unfavorable outcome of a matter is deemed to be reasonably possible, then the matter is disclosed and no liability is recorded. With respect to unasserted claims or assessments, management must first determine that the probability that an assertion will be made is likely, then, a determination as to the likelihood of an unfavorable outcome and the ability to reasonably estimate the potential loss is made. Legal matters are reviewed on a continuous basis or sooner if significant changes in matters have occurred to determine if a change in the likelihood of an unfavorable outcome or the estimate of a loss is necessary. 67 Table of Contents Asset Retirement Obligations. Alcoa recognizes asset retirement obligations (AROs) related to legal obligations associated with the normal operation of Alcoa bauxite mining, alumina refining, and aluminum smelting facilities. These AROs consist primarily of costs associated with spent pot lining disposal, closure of bauxite residue areas, mine reclamation, and landfill closure. Alcoa also recognizes AROs for any significant lease restoration obligation, if required by a lease agreement, and for the disposal of regulated waste materials related to the demolition of certain power facilities. The fair values of these AROs are recorded on a discounted basis, at the time the obligation is incurred, and accreted over time for the change in present value. Additionally, Alcoa capitalizes asset retirement costs by increasing the carrying amount of the related long-lived assets and depreciating these assets over their remaining useful life. Certain conditional asset retirement obligations (CAROs) related to alumina refineries, aluminum smelters, and fabrication facilities have not been recorded in the Consolidated Financial Statements due to uncertainties surrounding the ultimate settlement date. A CARO is a legal obligation to perform an asset retirement activity in which the timing and (or) method of settlement are conditional on a future event that may or may not be within Alcoa control. Such uncertainties exist as a result of the perpetual nature of the structures, maintenance and upgrade programs, and other factors. At the date a reasonable estimate of the ultimate settlement date can be made, Alcoa would record a retirement obligation for the removal, treatment, transportation, storage and (or) disposal of various regulated assets and hazardous materials such as asbestos, underground and aboveground storage tanks, polychlorinated biphenyls, various process residuals, solid wastes, electronic equipment waste, and various other materials. Such amounts may be material to the Consolidated Financial Statements in the period in which they are recorded. If Alcoa was required to demolish all such structures immediately, the estimated CARO as of December 31, 2010 ranges from less than $1 to $52 per structure (129 structures) in today dollars. Goodwill. Goodwill is not amortized; instead, it is tested for impairment annually (in the fourth quarter) or more frequently if indicators of impairment exist or if a decision is made to sell a business. A significant amount of judgment is involved in determining if an indicator of impairment has occurred. Such indicators may include a decline in expected cash flows, a significant adverse change in legal factors or in the business climate, unanticipated competition, or slower growth rates, among others. It is important to note that fair values that could be realized in an actual transaction may differ from those used to evaluate the impairment of goodwill. Goodwill is allocated among and evaluated for impairment at the reporting unit level, which is defined as an operating segment or one level below an operating segment. Alcoa has nine reporting units, of which five are included in the Engineered Products and Solutions segment. The remaining four reporting units are the Alumina segment, the Primary Metals segment, the Flat-Rolled Products segment, and the soft alloy extrusions business in Brazil, which is included in Corporate. Almost 90% of Alcoa total goodwill is allocated to three reporting units as follows: Alcoa Fastening Systems (AFS) ($1,009) and Alcoa Power and Propulsion (APP) ($1,623) businesses, both of which are included in the Engineered Products and Solutions segment, and Primary Metals ($1,851). These amounts include an allocation of Corporate goodwill. In 2010, the estimated fair values of all nine reporting units were substantially in excess of their carrying values, resulting in no impairment. The evaluation of impairment involves comparing the current fair value of each reporting unit to its carrying value, including goodwill. Alcoa uses a discounted cash flow model (DCF model) to estimate the current fair value of its reporting units when testing for impairment, as management believes forecasted cash flows are the best indicator of such fair value. A number of significant assumptions and estimates are involved in the application of the DCF model to forecast operating cash flows, including markets and market share, sales volumes and prices, costs to produce, tax rates, capital spending, discount rate, and working capital changes. Most of these assumptions vary significantly among the reporting units. Cash flow forecasts are generally based on approved business unit operating plans for the early years and historical relationships in later years. The betas used in calculating the individual reporting units weighted average cost of capital (WACC) rate are estimated for each business with the assistance of valuation experts. In the event the estimated fair value of a reporting unit per the DCF model is less than the carrying value, additional analysis would be required. The additional analysis would compare the carrying amount of the reporting unit 68 Table of Contents goodwill with the implied fair value of that goodwill, which may involve the use of valuation experts. The implied fair value of goodwill is the excess of the fair value of the reporting unit over the fair value amounts assigned to all of the assets and liabilities of that unit as if the reporting unit was acquired in a business combination and the fair value of the reporting unit represented the purchase price. If the carrying value of goodwill exceeds its implied fair value, an impairment loss equal to such excess would be recognized, which could significantly and adversely impact reported results of operations and shareholders equity. Equity Investments. Alcoa invests in a number of privately-held companies, primarily through joint ventures and consortiums, which are accounted for on the equity method. The equity method is applied in situations where Alcoa has the ability to exercise significant influence, but not control, over the investee. Management reviews equity investments for impairment whenever certain indicators are present suggesting that the carrying value of an investment is not recoverable. This analysis requires a significant amount of judgment from management to identify events or circumstances indicating that an equity investment is impaired. The following items are examples of impairment indicators: significant, sustained declines in an investee revenue, earnings, and cash flow trends; adverse market conditions of the investee industry or geographic area; the investee ability to continue operations measured by several items, including liquidity; and other factors. Once an impairment indicator is identified, management uses considerable judgment to determine if the impairment is other than temporary, in which case the equity investment is written down to its estimated fair value. An impairment that is other than temporary could significantly and adversely impact reported results of operations. Properties, Plants, and Equipment. Properties, plants, and equipment are reviewed for impairment whenever events or changes in circumstances indicate that the carrying amount of such assets (asset group) may not be recoverable. Recoverability of assets is determined by comparing the estimated undiscounted net cash flows of the operations related to the assets (asset group) to their carrying amount. An impairment loss would be recognized when the carrying amount of the assets (asset group) exceeds the estimated undiscounted net cash flows. The amount of the impairment loss to be recorded is calculated as the excess of the carrying value of the assets (asset group) over their fair value, with fair value determined using the best information available, which generally is a DCF model. The determination of what constitutes an asset group, the associated estimated undiscounted net cash flows, and the estimated useful lives of assets also require significant judgments. Discontinued Operations and Assets Held For Sale. The fair values of all businesses to be divested are estimated using accepted valuation techniques such as a DCF model, valuations performed by third parties, earnings multiples, or indicative bids, when available. A number of significant estimates and assumptions are involved in the application of these techniques, including the forecasting of markets and market share, sales volumes and prices, costs and expenses, and multiple other factors. Management considers historical experience and all available information at the time the estimates are made; however, the fair values that are ultimately realized upon the sale of the businesses to be divested may differ from the estimated fair values reflected in the Consolidated Financial Statements. Pension and Other Postretirement Benefits. Liabilities and expenses for pension and other postretirement benefits are determined using actuarial methodologies and incorporate significant assumptions, including the interest rate used to discount the future estimated liability, the expected long-term rate of return on plan assets, and several assumptions relating to the employee workforce (salary increases, medical costs, retirement age, and mortality). The interest rate used to discount future estimated liabilities is determined using a Company-specific yield curve model (above-median) developed with the assistance of an external actuary. The cash flows of the plans projected benefit obligations are discounted using a single equivalent rate derived from yields on high quality corporate bonds, which represent a broad diversification of issuers in various sectors, including finance and banking, manufacturing, transportation, insurance, and pharmaceutical, among others. The yield curve model parallels the plans projected cash flows, which have an average duration of 10 years, and the underlying cash flows of the bonds included in the model exceed the cash flows needed to satisfy the Company plans obligations multiple times. The impact on the liabilities of a change in the discount rate of 1/4 of 1% would be approximately $355 and either a charge or credit of $12 to after-tax earnings in the following year. 69 Table of Contents The expected long-term rate of return on plan assets is generally applied to a five-year market-related value of plan assets (a four-year average or the fair value at the plan measurement date is used for certain non-U.S. plans). The process used by management to develop this assumption has expanded from one that relied primarily on historical asset return information to one that also incorporates forward-looking returns by asset class, as described below. Prior to developing the expected long-term rate of return for calendar year 2009, management focused on historical actual returns (annual, 10-year moving, and 20-year moving averages) when developing this assumption. Based on that process, management utilized 9% for the expected long-term rate of return for several years through 2008. For calendar year 2009, the expected long-term rate of return was reduced to 8.75% due to lower future expected market returns as a result of the then global economic downturn. This was supported by the fact that, in 2008, the 10-year moving average of actual performance fell below 9% for the first time in 20 years, although the 20-year moving average continued to exceed 9%. For calendar year 2010, management expanded its process by incorporating expected future returns on current and planned asset allocations using information from various external investment managers and management own judgment. Management considered this forward-looking analysis as well as the historical return information, and concluded the expected rate of return for calendar 2010 would remain at 8.75%, which was between the 20-year moving average actual return performance and the estimated future return developed by asset class. For calendar year 2011, management again incorporated both actual historical return information and expected future returns into its analysis. Based on strategic asset allocations and current estimates of future returns by asset class, management will be using 8.50% as its expected long-term rate of return for 2011. This rate again falls within the range of the 20-year moving average of actual performance and the expected future return developed by asset class. A change in the assumption for the expected long-term rate of return on plan assets of 1/4 of 1% would impact after-tax earnings by approximately $16 for 2011. In 2010, a net charge of $216 ($138 after-tax) was recorded in other comprehensive income, primarily due to a 40 basis point decrease in the discount rate, which was somewhat offset by the favorable performance of the plan assets and the recognition of actuarial losses and prior service costs. In 2009, a net charge of $182 ($102 after-tax) was recorded in other comprehensive loss, primarily due to a 25 basis point decrease in the discount rate, which was somewhat offset by the favorable performance of the plan assets and the recognition of actuarial losses and prior service costs. Additionally, in 2010 and 2009, a charge of $2 and $8, respectively, was recorded in accumulated other comprehensive loss due to the reclassification of deferred taxes related to the Medicare Part D prescription drug subsidy. Stock-based Compensation. Alcoa recognizes compensation expense for employee equity grants using the non-substantive vesting period approach, in which the expense (net of estimated forfeitures) is recognized ratably over the requisite service period based on the grant date fair value. The fair value of new stock options is estimated on the date of grant using a lattice-pricing model. Determining the fair value of stock options at the grant date requires judgment, including estimates for the average risk-free interest rate, dividend yield, volatility, annual forfeiture rate, and exercise behavior. These assumptions may differ significantly between grant dates because of changes in the actual results of these inputs that occur over time. As part of Alcoa stock-based compensation plan design, individuals who are retirement-eligible have a six-month requisite service period in the year of grant. Equity grants are issued in January each year. As a result, a larger portion of expense will be recognized in the first half of each year for these retirement-eligible employees. Compensation expense recorded in 2010, 2009, and 2008 was $84 ($57 after-tax), $87 ($58 after-tax), and $94 ($63 after-tax), respectively. Of this amount, $19, $21, and $19 in 2010, 2009, and 2008, respectively, pertains to the acceleration of expense related to retirement-eligible employees. Plan participants can choose whether to receive their award in the form of stock options, stock awards, or a combination of both. This choice is made before the grant is issued and is irrevocable. 70 Table of Contents Income Taxes. The provision for income taxes is determined using the asset and liability approach of accounting for income taxes. Under this approach, the provision for income taxes represents income taxes paid or payable (or received or receivable) for the current year plus the change in deferred taxes during the year. Deferred taxes represent the future tax consequences expected to occur when the reported amounts of assets and liabilities are recovered or paid, and result from differences between the financial and tax bases of Alcoa assets and liabilities and are adjusted for changes in tax rates and tax laws when enacted. Valuation allowances are recorded to reduce deferred tax assets when it is more likely than not that a tax benefit will not be realized. In evaluating the need for a valuation allowance, management considers all potential sources of taxable income, including income available in carryback periods, future reversals of taxable temporary differences, projections of taxable income, and income from tax planning strategies, as well as all positive and negative evidence. Positive evidence includes factors such as a history of profitable operations, projections of future profitability within the carryforward period, including from tax planning strategies, and the Company experience with similar operations. Existing favorable contracts and the ability to sell products into established markets are additional positive evidence. Negative evidence includes items such as cumulative losses, projections of future losses, or carryforward periods that are not long enough to allow for the utilization of a deferred tax asset based on existing projections of income. Deferred tax assets for which no valuation allowance is recorded may not be realized upon changes in facts and circumstances. Tax benefits related to uncertain tax positions taken or expected to be taken on a tax return are recorded when such benefits meet a more likely than not threshold. Otherwise, these tax benefits are recorded when a tax position has been effectively settled, which means that the statute of limitation has expired or the appropriate taxing authority has completed their examination even though the statute of limitations remains open. Interest and penalties related to uncertain tax positions are recognized as part of the provision for income taxes and are accrued beginning in the period that such interest and penalties would be applicable under relevant tax law until such time that the related tax benefits are recognized. Related Party Transactions Alcoa buys products from and sells products to various related companies, consisting of entities in which Alcoa retains a 50% or less equity interest, at negotiated arms-length prices between the two parties. These transactions were not material to the financial position or results of operations of Alcoa for all periods presented.
